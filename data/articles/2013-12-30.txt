Russ Koesterich: 2014 Is Going To Be A Lot Like 2013 (BlackRock)  Going into 2014, BlackRock's' Russ Koesterich writes that "from a broad perspective, many may feel a sense of dÃ©jÃ vu, since we expect most of the macro factors that existed in 2013 to persist: improving (but still relatively slow) economic growth, very low inflation and slowly rising interest rates." But he does see a modest pick up is US and global GDP growth lower energy prices Based off that he has a few key investment themes: "We would advise investors to continue overweighting stocks in their portfolios. Equities may not be as inexpensive as they were a year ago, but they remain more attractive than bonds and cash. There are some important caveats to this view, however: We do expect more volatility in 2014 than we saw in 2013, and we think investors should be more selective. In particular, international stocks are worth investor attention, as they appear more reasonably priced than U.S. equities. We would also encourage investors with longer-term time horizons to consider emerging markets despite their recent underperformance, as they too offer compelling value. "There are few bargains in fixed income markets. With rates likely to rise and inflation still low, we would avoid both long-dated Treasuries and Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS). Instead, we advocate sticking with fixed income credit sectors, including high yield bonds. Additionally, we believe municipal market fundamentals are sound and that muni bonds look attractiveâ€”especially as investors complete their 2013 tax returns and feel the impact of higher taxes." 14 Things Advisors Should Do If They Want To Be Successful In 2014 (Investment News)  Financial advisors need to do 14 things if they want to be successful in 2014, according to Robert Sofia at Investment News. 1. They shouldn't forget about Generation X and Millennial investors considering 29% of wealthy investors are under the age of 50 and that Gen X and Millennials are expected to inherit over $41 trillion by 2052. 2. Advisors should update their website. 3. They should also invest in better technology. 4. They should take social media more seriously. 5. Make better use of video to market. 6. Advisors should specialize instead of making their practice appeal to everyone. 7. Advisors should ask clients what they want and expect. 8. They should also "wow" clients with surprises, "while clients are unlikely to talk about the annual review they had with their adviser, they will brag about how he threw them a surprise wedding anniversary party." 9. They should host social events. 10. They should have a minimum account size even if it is as low as $50,000 because it sends the message that their time is worth more than the average advisor. 11. They should have a coach and a confidant. 12. The should make time for business planning. 13. Advisors should get better at delegating tasks. 14. Finally, they should have writhed plans that will force them to stick to their goals. FINRA Warns Against Conflicts Of Interest When It Comes To IRA Rollovers (FINRA) 61% of Americans are worried about not having enough money for retirement, according to a Gallup poll. So, FINRA has said it will be watching broker dealers closely for conflicts of interest. Typically, when a plan participant is leaving an employer they can do one of four things 1. Leave the money with the former employer if that is an option. 2. Roll over the assets to his new employer's plan if a rollover is possible. 3. Roll over into an IRA. 4. Cash out.Â  When firms and their registered representatives recommend that an investor move their money into an IRA they could earn a commission or fee, whereas they wouldn't get one if they kept the money with an old employer or transferred it to a new one. "FINRA urges broker-dealers to review their retirement services activities to assess conflicts of interest. Firms must supervise these activities to reasonably ensure that conflicts of interest do not impair the judgment of a registered representative or another associated person about what is in the customerâ€™s interest and that they neither confuse investors nor interfere with important educational efforts." The Most Important Driver Of Profit Margins (Goldman Sachs)  Goldman Sachs' Jan Hatzius doesn't profit margins will contract in 2014. This is because the gap between inflation and unit labor cost inflation is the most important driver of profit margins. "When prices grow faster than unit labor costs, firms typically manage to raise their profit margins, and vice versa. In our view, the price/ULC gap is likely to move back into slightly positive territory in 2014," he writes. "Of course, the price/ULC gap is not the only driver of margins," continued Hatzius. "But other factors are also likely to look reasonably friendly. We expect foreign profits to improve in 2014 as the global economy gathers some momentum, and see no major changes in corporate income taxes or financial profits." Goldman Sachs Wall Street Is Already Raising Its 2014 Stock Market Forecasts (Citi) After the stock market's great run in 2013, Wall Street economists are already upwardly revising their 2014 forecasts. Citi's Tobias Levkovich who had an initial S&amp;P 500 target of 1,900, just revised it up to 1,975, though he does warn that there could be a 5-10% correction in the first half of 2014.Â  "The good news from credit conditions, hiring intentions and capital spending plans on the economy and likely earnings growth can provide upside appreciation potential while sentiment, intra-stock correlation and even valuation suggest concern," added Levkovich. "Overall, we can get to a 1,975 kind of outcome, but we may also see choppier markets and early indicators on volatility also intimate reasons to be worried."
Strategic GroupTo those appalled or surprised by the Times Square Applebees' $375 New Year's Eve party, allow us to offer an alternative for a modest price differential. For $40,000 The Dream Hotel Downtown is offering a king's table for you and 30 or so of your friends. The table comes with 20 bottles of Circo vodka, 20 bottles of 2004 Moet Chandon Imperial, and a new friend for the night, Macklemore. See, it's not hard to find people doing some seriously ostentatious partying in New York City on New Year's Eve. What's harder is finding out who — or which spots — are taking the affair more seriously than everyone else. That means setting a solid base — a $40,000 base. After that, it can only get bigger. The Dream Downtown's package is called, "Living the Dream," and it was Strategic Group's Jonathan Schwartz, who made it into a reality after the Dream managed to pin down Macklemore as its New Year's Eve host earlier this month. "It's funny he [Macklemore] came to the Dream Downtown for the MTV after party that Jay-Z and Diddy held, and he took a liking to it there," said Schwartz. The Dream Downtown isn't the only spot offering New Year's revelers a super-luxe table. The word on the street is the LIV, the club at Miami's Fontainebleau Hotel has a dream table for its NYE bash featuring Pharrell and Afrojack. Here in New York City, Cedric Gervias is DJing at Marquee and for $20,000 a table of guests can dance right as his feet. This flies in the face of everyone that has said that bottle service is dead in nightlife. It's not. Yes, the DJ experience is drawing crowds that just want to dance, but that didn't kill bottle service, it just rolled it in, and then segmented it into another kind of party. If you want it, it's there, if you don't, that's cool too. Marquee's deal is a perfect example of that — you can have the big name DJ, and the pricey table all at once. Or you can forego the latter and rock with the masses. In other words — Not sitting at the Dream Downtown's $40,000 table, or the $15,000 table, or the $10,000 means that you won't get a waitress (gymnast) doing back flips with a sparkler in her mouth delivering your bottles to you, but you can still get into the party by buying a general admission tickets starting at $250. So mabe you could still make friends with Macklemore if you really, really tried. Check out the flier for the party below: Dream Downtown
HP has officially ratcheted up its layoff numbers again. It will be cutting another 5,000 jobs above and beyond the 29,000 jobs it had previously targeted. And that was an increase from the 27,000 jobs it announced in May 2012, as first reported by Business Insider. In HP's previous quarterly earnings reports filed with the SEC, it warned investors that the company might get rid of more than 29,000 employees. In its annual report filed on Monday, it made the bigger layoff official, declaring it would cut 34,000 jobs. Here's what HP said in that SEC document: Due to continued market and business pressures, as of October 31, 2013, HP expects to eliminate an additional 15% of those 29,000 positions, or a total of approximately 34,000 positions, and to record an additional 15% of that $3.6 billion in total costs, or approximately $4.1 billion in aggregate charges. HP expects to record these charges through the end of HP's 2014 fiscal year as the accounting recognition. UPDATED: That reference to October refers to a statement by CFO Cathie Lesjak during an analysts call when she warned again that HP might lay off more people: So, Toni, lets start with the restructuring program. Our restructuring program is really on track. At the end of fiscal â€™13, on a program to date basis, roughly 24,600 people exited under the program. So thatâ€™s just under 13,000 in fiscal â€™13. As we talked about Security Analyst Meeting, our current plan is to end -- at the end of â€˜14 at the high-end of our range, so 29,000 plus 15%, so somewhere between 33,000 and 34,000 people. HP CEO Meg Whitman has promised that HP will not do another big layoff once this one is complete. It is supposed to end by October, 2014, HP says. HP says it currently has about 331,800 employees. The silver lining for current employees is that HP has already done most of the cutting. As of October 31, 2013, HP had eliminated approximately 24,600 positions of the 34,000 it expects to cut, the company said in its annual report.
REUTERS/Carlos Garcia RawlinsA woman walks at a market in Caracas.Venezuela's inflation soared to 56.2 percent in 2013 but slowed in the last two months of the year after the socialist government forced stores to cut prices, officials said Monday. The national consumer price index decelerated from 5.1 percent in October to 4.8 percent in November and 2.2 percent in December, the central bank said in a report that was 20 days late. President Nicolas Maduro said the figures led to annual inflation of 56.2 percent -- the highest in Latin America -- which he blamed on a "parasitic capitalist economy." "If Venezuela was not subjected to this economic war, we would have single-digit inflation, not 56 percent," Maduro told a news conference. Inflation is nearly three times as high as in 2012, when it hit 20.1 percent. Maduro ordered appliance stores in November to slash prices, sent troops to enforce the move and threatened to arrest store owners who refused to comply. Analysts attribute the nation's high inflation to rigid currency and price controls that were launched in 2003 by late president Hugo Chavez, who died in March this year. The government has fixed the exchange rate at 6.3 bolivars for one dollar, fuelling a black market where the US currency is obtained at nine times the official rate. The oil-rich country, which is heavily dependent on imports, has been plagued by shortages of basic goods ranging from meat to toilet paper. The central bank's report lacked its usual "scarcity" index, which serves gauge of the country's chronic shortages. Maduro said authorities found food prices inflated by more than 3,000 percent and that, had it not been for government-subsidized food programs, "there would have been a famine." The central bank's report said food prices jumped 7.5 percent in November compared to 5.6 percent a month earlier. "As has been the case in Venezuelan history, political tension and economic destabilization mixed in the form of a real economic war against the Venezuelan people," the central bank said.

REUTERS/Mike Stone WALLA WALLA COUNTY, WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. beef industry's dependence on the muscle-building drug Zilmax began unraveling here, on a sweltering summer day, in the dusty cattle pens outside a TysonFoods Inc slaughterhouse in southeastern Washington state. As cattle trailers that had traveled up to four hours in 95-degree heat began to unload, 15 heifers and steers hobbled down the ramps on August 5, barely able to walk. The reason: The animals had lost their hooves, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture documents reviewed by Reuters. The documents show the 15 animals were destroyed. The next day, the hottest day of the month, two more animals with missing hooves arrived by truck. Again, the animals were destroyed, the documents show. The animals' feet were "basically coming apart," said Keith Belk, a professor of animal science at Colorado State University. Belk said he reviewed photos of the lame cattle, though he declined to say who showed them to him. The 17 animals had a factor in common, according to an examination of U.S. government documents and interviews with people who had direct knowledge of the events. In the weeks before the cattle were shipped toTyson's slaughterhouse, outside the city limits of Pasco, all had been fed Merck &amp; Co Inc's profit-enhancing animal feed additive, Zilmax. The day after the hoofless animals were euthanized on August 6, Tyson told its feedlot customers it would stop accepting Zilmax-fed cattle. After Reuters reported the existence of a videotape of apparently lame Zilmax-fedanimals - shown by an official of meatpacking giant JBS USA LLC at a trade meeting in Colorado - Merck itself temporarily suspended sales of the drug in the U.S. and Canada. The rest of the nation's leading meatpackers soon followed Tyson, the largest U.S. meat processor. Merck, in a statement to Reuters, stressed the safety of its product. It said the company investigates all reports of adverse reactions to its drugs, and did so after the deaths near Pasco. "Several third-party experts were brought in to evaluate the situation, review the data and identify potential causes for the hoof issue," Merck's statement said. "The findings from the investigation showed that the hoof loss was not due to the fact these animals had received Zilmax." Merck declined to identify the names of the third-party investigators or provide more detail on the research findings. After temporarily halting Zilmax sales, Merck continues to state Zilmax is safe when used as directed, with no welfare concerns discovered in 30 research studies since the product was introduced in the United States in 2007. In addition, Merck said, the company is planning more field evaluations of Zilmax, using "a well-designed collection and analysis of data by third-party industry experts." A "prominent" epidemiologist and veterinarian will oversee the work, Merck said. Tyson Foods spokesman Gary Mickelson said his company doesn't know exactly what happened to the small group of cattle that were destroyed at the plant near Pasco. Some animal health experts have told Tyson the use of Zilmax is a possible cause, he said. Tyson had seen some cattle mobility issues in the past, but "the issues at Pasco this summer were more severe" than the company had seen before, Mickelson said. QUESTIONS ARISE Scientists say they have yet to determine whether Zilmax causes ailments so severe that cattle must be euthanized. One theory is that the federally approved feed additive may compound the effects of common feedlot nutritional disorders such as acidosis, which can affect animals that consume too much starch (primarily grain) or sugar in a short period of time. Heat and animal genetics, too, may be factors. Regardless, the episode at the Tyson plant - which hasn't been publicly disclosed until now - is coming to light at a time of growing concern over risks to animal and human health posed by the increased use of pharmaceuticals in food production. Livestock pharmaceuticals use is expanding as part of the push to produce more meat at lower cost. Earlier this month, in an effort to combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria that threatens human health, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration rolled out new policies to phase out the use of antibiotics that make cows, pigs and chickens plumper. The FDA has said that meat produced from cattle fed with Zilmax is safe for human consumption. The cases of hoofless cattle also raise ethical questions about whether the drive by modern agriculture to produce greater volumes of food, as cheaply as possible, is coming at the cost of animal welfare. Of the more than 30 million beef cattle slaughtered in the U.S. annually, most move smoothly through a mechanized system that is among the most efficient in the world. Reports that Zilmax causes lameness in some animals have raised concerns about the tradeoffs associated with a drug that adds up to 33 pounds of marketable meat to a 1,300-pound steer and has helped some feedlots stay in business at a time of punishing industry consolidation. Livestock nutritionists, veterinarians and cattle researchers told Reuters that cattle losing hooves would be in great pain. Animals that have lost their hooves may take tentative steps, as if walking on glass, they said. Even when prodded, they sometimes refuse to rise back to their feet. Livestock researcher Temple Grandin, who has pioneered humane slaughterhouse practices as a consultant to major beef processors, said it would be like a person having their toe nails yanked off. "It would hurt a whole lot," said Grandin, who said she has not witnessed any of the incidents of Zilmax-fed cattle with lost hooves. When animals delivered to slaughterhouses are unable to walk on their own, Agriculture Department regulations require such "downer" cattle be destroyed and their meat prevented from reaching consumers. Federal law requires Merck to report all animal deaths, as well as any other adverse reactions, in connection with use of its products. A review of reports submitted by Merck and others to the FDA shows at least 285 cattle have died unexpectedly or been destroyed in the United States after being fed Zilmax since the drug was introduced in 2007. The FDA reports specify the ailments that led to the unexpected deaths, but do not consistently state whether the animals expired on their own or were euthanized. According to the reports, reviewed by Reuters through a Freedom of Information Act request, at least 75 animals lost hooves and were euthanized after being fed Zilmax over the past two years. The reports show pneumonia was a factor in the death of 94 Zilmax-fed cattle. And a build-up of gas in bovine stomachs, referred to as bloat, was listed as a cause in 41 cases of cattle fed Zilmax. Of the 285 animals that died, 113 were fed either an animal-based antibiotic, or another medication to boost weight, or both, in conjunction with Zilmax. PREPARING FOR A RETURN Some veterinarians and animal experts say there is no proof Zilmax was the chief cause of any cattle deaths. "My assessment is that I do not see data supporting the concerns today, at least the data that I have reviewed and been aware of," said University of Nebraska-Lincoln animal science professor Galen Erickson, in response to questions from Reuters about Zilmax's safety. But some previously staunch supporters of Merck's innovative growth drug are beginning to question the product's safety record. "Maybe we found the point where we pushed the cattle just so hard in the sake of making a buck that we exceeded the biological limits of the cattle," said Abe Turgeon, a prominent livestock nutritionist, who had previously recommended Zilmax to some customers. Merck Animal Health, the unit that markets the additive, said proper use of Zilmax "does not affect the safety or well-being of cattle." Moving beyond the 30 studies it cited at the time it suspended Zilmax sales, Merck in August launched an audit of how the product was being used in the field, created an advisory board to review management practices in the feedlot and animal nutrition industries, and provided new funds for field research onZilmax-fed cattle. Today, the company has said it plans to reintroduce Zilmax, but noted it is too soon to know when sales to U.S. and Canadian customers may resume. Merck has begun approaching cattle nutritionists, livestock academics and other professionals who influence opinion in an effort to gain industry insight and win support for the return of the drug, according to several people who have met with the company. The FDA regulates livestock feed additives sold in the United States, and is charged with intervening when a pharmaceutical product it has approved causes harm when used as directed. The agency said it has taken no action related to Zilmax. When asked for comment about the adverse-event reports filed by Merck, an FDA spokeswoman in a statement said the agency "has not reached any conclusions on the safety of Zilmax but the agency is continuing to receive and evaluate data. As part of this process, the agency is always interested in new information." The Merck suspension of Zilmax sales is voluntary, and at this point the company could return Zilmax to the market without seeking permission from the FDA. PROFIT ON THE PLATE Zilmax is a medicated feed supplement for beef cattle that belongs to a class of drugs known as beta-agonists, which are also used in humans to ease asthma symptoms. Zilmax, with its active ingredient zilpaterol hydrochloride, is a federally approved weight-gaining supplement. It is added to cattle feed in the weeks before slaughter to add extra pounds of profit-producing meat. Zilmax was worth nearly $160 million in annual sales in the United States and Canada last year, and was a steady cash generator for Merck's animal health business, which has about $3.3 billion in global sales. The additive served as a go-to solution for a troubled cattle industry, as one-fifth of the nation's feedlots went out of business over the last decade. With cattle herds in sharp decline, Zilmax worked along with improved animal genetics and feed to produce more meat with fewer animals. The United States produced nearly 26 billion pounds of beef from a herd of 91 million cattle in 2012, according to USDA data. In 1975, when the nation's cattle herd hit a peak of 135 million head, the industry produced nearly 24 billion pounds of beef. Last month, beef cattle walking into a U.S. packing plant on average weighed a record 1,346 pounds — up more than 20 percent in the last two decades. Merck's Zilmax quickly developed a loyal customer base. Its popularity spread even to the show circuit, where ranchers' children today can win prizes exceeding $100,000 for raising big-girth bovines. ADVERSE EVENTS Tyson and rival beef processor Cargill Inc have told Reuters they will not accept Zilmax-fed cattle until Merck can provide a scientific vetting of Zilmax's safety to animals and the companies are confident any animal welfare issues are resolved. (Cargill says it didn't see the cattle lameness problems cited by JBS and Tyson.) Both companies, too, have cited concerns about China and other nations that have barred the importation of meat produced from Zilmax-fed cattle. They fear that if such meat is accidentally sent to these countries, it could hurt their export businesses. FDA records based on 59 adverse event reports filed since 2008 by Merck and Intervet Inc - the original developer of Zilmax before Merck acquired the firm in 2009 - chronicle incidents of Zilmax-fed cattle experiencing stomach ulcers, brain lesions and blindness. Merck also has reported incidents of Zilmax-fed animals showing signs of lethargy, bloody noses, respiratory problems and heart failure. In September 2011, an unidentified veterinarian at an Oregon feedlot reported "unusual hoof loss in cattle being fedZilmax," according to one adverse event report reviewed by Reuters. In August this year, Merck reported an additional five episodes involving 66 cattle in Oregon and Idaho that lost their hooves after a Zilmax feeding regimen. In some cases, a consulting veterinarian also cited high ambient temperature and a cement-and-rebar floor that may have exacerbated the hoof damage. Also in August, one Nebraska cattle producer, who is not named in the FDA documents, reported he had more dead cattle when he used Zilmax than when he didn't, according to the documents. A Reuters review of data kept by the U.S. Agriculture Department show that euthanizations of cattle have risen substantially since Zilmax came on the market. In the two years after Zilmax was introduced, the number of beef steers and heifers euthanized prior to slaughter at U.S. packing plants rose nearly 175 percent from previous levels. The number of euthanized steers and heifers has ranged between 1,600 and 2,300 cattle each year since then. That new plateau is well above the average of 670 a year in the four years before Zilmax came on the market in 2007. The government data does not, though, draw a link between Zilmax or any other possible factors and the increase in euthanized cattle at meatpacking plants. The number of euthanized cattle and the other reports of cattle dying is also quite small relative to the more than 30 million cattle slaughtered each year. It is small enough that it likely hasn't raised significant red flags with the FDA, said David Acheson, the agency's former Associate Commissioner for Food. "I suspect that that's not going to trigger them to do much," Acheson said. DEATH IN THE HEAT Tyson's plant, about 14 miles southeast of Pasco, is an integrated modern-day packing operation, stretching the length of several football fields. Five days a week, more than 1,300 workers arrive and walk past security guards toward a mechanical rumble emanating from the plant's gunmetal gray walls. Tyson acquired the operation, one of its smaller plants, in 2001. It processes roughly 2,000 cattle a day, according to workers and local residents. Tyson would not comment on the number. Washington state lies in the Pacific Northwest, with its soaring mountains and chilly rain. But the eastern flatlands around Pasco more closely resemble the Southwest's desert - and sometimes share its soaring summer temperatures. To guard against the heat, Tyson has provided cover or shade for some holding pens at the plant. Overhead sprinkler systems help cool the cattle, too. But 2013 saw one of the hottest summers in a quarter century, with at least three heat waves in which temperatures in the area topped 100 degrees, according to National Climatic Data Center. Temperatures were spiking on many of the dates when a total of 37 cattle were euthanized this summer due to lameness associated with Zilmax. According to USDA documents and people knowledgeable about the events, some of the animals were shipped from Beef Northwest of North Powder, Oregon. On August 5, of 17 cattle that were euthanized at Tyson's plant, the USDA inspector who condemned the animals noted that 15 had "lost toes." Two were destroyed for other reasons. The inspector identified at least one of the animals in the group that was put down as a heifer originating from Nyssa, Oregon. Beef Northwest operates a feedlot in Nyssa. Animals making the trip to Pasco would have stood in a trailer for four hours on a 95-degree day as it traveled to Tyson's plant. John Wilson, managing partner of Beef Northwest, confirmed that his company was using a Zilmax feed regimen this summer. About 40 of Beef Northwest's animals "developed lameness after arriving at a packing plant in two incidents in July and August of this year," he said. Wilson declined to identify the slaughterhouse and would not confirm the animals were destroyed. Wilson said Beef Northwest had never faced lameness problems with its Zilmax-fed animals before this summer. While Beef Northwest was dispensing Zilmax, Wilson said, the company strictly followed Merck's dosage and other instructions. Beef Northwest says it frequently conducted internal and third-party audits to ensure employees were not over-feeding Zilmax to the animals. "In our cases, dosages were not an issue, never an issue," Wilson said in a phone interview. "I'd like to think that we were on the upper edge of the industry as far as heavy oversight of all of our protocols." BELIEVERS AND NON-BELIEVERS As feed-grain prices soared amid strong demand among livestock and ethanol producers in recent years, and with drought ravaging the U.S. crop belt, Zilmax seemed like an attractive solution. Some feedlot owners nicknamed it "Vitamin Z." "We couldn't find feed cheap enough to make any money" on raising cattle, said Turgeon, the cattle nutritionist who works with Beef Northwest. Many clients had adopted another beta-agonist - Optaflexx, made by Eli Lilly and Co's Elanco Animal Health unit.Elanco is Merck's biggest rival in the animal health business. The two products use different active ingredients: Optaflexx is based on ractopamine, while Zilmax uses zilpaterol. But Zilmax added more weight to cattle than Optaflexx did, say industry nutritionists and feedlot owners. That perceived advantage helped Zilmax gain market share and sales faster than Optaflexx in recent years, say industry experts. Turgeon had heard from his customers about lameness problems associated with Zilmax, and a colleague this summer showed him photos of animals with hooves peeling off, he said. Reuters has not seen any photos of cattle with missing hooves. Merck is now trying to win the industry back. At a closed-door session of an Academy of Veterinary Consultants conference in Denver on December 5, some 300 cattle veterinarians sparred over Zilmax. During the debate, they broke into informal camps of "believers" who think Zilmax hurts cattle, and "disbelievers" who discount its negative effects, according to Larry Moczygemba, president of the academy. The veterinarians debated the effects of Zilmax and other beta-agonist drugs, Moczygemba said, without reaching a conclusion. Merck employees stayed in the room, mostly remaining silent. "Few, if any, think this is just a beta-agonist problem all on its own," Moczygemba said. "But our role as vets puts animal well being first." (Reporting By P.J.

WeatherCasterWell that didn't take long. 2014 hasn't even started and already meteorologists are predicting it could kick off with a major snowstorm, hitting parts of New England as early as Thursday. Two systems are expected to merge into one powerful low-pressure system, according to Weather.com, which has the potential to bring some heavy snowfall, perhaps six inches or more. There will also be low temperatures for New England, including potential single-digit temperatures in New York City For most of New England, it seems likely that there will be "enough snow to shovel and plow," AccuWeather.com senior meteorologist Brett Anderson said. It's too early to give more specific snowfall amounts, since the storm is still three or four days away, originating from a system that is now parked off the Alaskan coastline. "This storm is by no means 'locked up' just yet," Boston-based meteorologist Terry Eliasen said.

johnrobertshepherd/FlickrCrocs' shares are going crazy today on the announcement that private equity giant Blackstone invested $200 million in the company.  The Blackstone endorsement bodes well for Crocs — a retailer that has struggled to build a brand image outside of its clunky signature product.  Despite mass hate for the shoes Crocs is known for, the brand still has a couple of huge opportunities for growth, report Dana Mattioli and Mike Spector at The Wall Street Journal. First, the brand isn't just about rubber clogs. Crocs is aggressively pushing new products like ballet flats, pumps, and open-toe wedges, as Bloomberg Businessweek reported earlier this year.  Crocs is even manufacturing the shoes in Italy to give the footwear some credibility.  Executives hope the new merchandise will double sales in the next five years. Brand experts told Businessweek that with the right audience and marketing, the shoes could do well.  Crocs' other big opportunity is in Asia, where the retailer is aggressively expanding its wholesale and retail businesses.  Asian customers also don't have the negative assumptions about Crocs that U.S. customers do, which has led to huge success. Last year, Asia accounted for 41% of Crocs' $1.1 billion in total sales while the the U.S. and Canada accounted for 44%, according to the Wall Street Journal.  By next year, Asia will be the top market, WSJ reports. 
ReutersShen Jianhe looks on as police officers conduct a check at the Shen Wu textile factory in Prato.Shen Jianhe lost both her job and home when Italian police shut down her garment factory in the Tuscan city of Prato. By day, the 38-year-old mother of four would sew trousers at one of the nearly 5,000 workshops run by Chinese immigrants in Prato, which largely turn out cheap clothing for fast-fashion companies in Italy and across Europe. At night she slept in a plasterboard cubicle hidden behind a wooden wardrobe at the Shen Wu factory - until the police arrived one cold December morning. They sealed the doors and confiscated the 25 sewing machines under a crackdown on an industry that is booming but blighted by illegality and sweatshop conditions. Amid rolls of fabric, food leftovers and dangling electric cables lay Shen's belongings: a pink baby coat, a blue children's stool, a laptop. She stuffed them into a van, ready to be transported away. "What choice do I have?" said Shen, tears filling her eyes. Prato, the historical capital of Italy's textile business, has attracted the largest concentration of Chinese-run industry in Europe within less than 20 years. As many as 50,000 Chinese live and work in the area, making clothes bearing the prized "Made in Italy" label which sets them apart from garments produced in China itself, even at the lower end of the fashion business. In some ways, the Chinese community of Prato has succeeded where Italian companies have failed. Italy's economy has barely grown over the past decade and is only just emerging from recession, partly due to the inability of many small manufacturers to keep up with global competition. Yet Prato, which lies 25 km (16 miles) from the Renaissance jewel of Florence, is also a thriving hub of illegality committed by both Italians and Chinese, a byproduct of globalization gone wrong, many people in the city say. Up to two thirds of the Chinese in Prato are illegal immigrants, according to local authorities. About 90 percent of the Chinese factories - virtually all of which are rented out to Chinese entrepreneurs by Italians who own the buildings -break the law in various ways, says Aldo Milone, the city councilor in charge of security. This includes using fabric smuggled from China, evading taxes and grossly violating health and labor regulations. This month a fire, which prosecutors suspect was set off by an electric stove, killed seven workers as they slept in cardboard cubicles at a workshop. Italian officials acknowledge they haven't cracked down effectively on the mushrooming illicit behavior. Prato mayor Roberto Cenni, himself a textiles entrepreneur, arrived in 2009 promising to clean up the area. Cenni says he has trebled inspections since then, but still only a small fraction of the factories are monitored regularly. "We don't have the ability to fight this system of illegality," he said, noting that Prato has only two labor inspectors. In some cases, local officials share the blame. Prato chief prosecutor Piero Tony ordered the arrest of 11 people this month, including a city council employee who is suspected of issuing false residency permits - for between 600 and 1,500 ($820-$2,100) euros a piece - to more than 300 Chinese immigrants since May. Most of Prato's Chinese come from Wenzhou, a coastal city in Zhejiang province. They started flocking to Prato in the mid-1990s to work in Italian-owned textile factories and quickly mastered the entire production chain. Andrea Cavicchi, local head of the Confindustria business lobby, says China's entry in the World Trade Organisation in 2001 sounded the death knell for many of Prato's local clothing artisans as trade barriers imposed by the European Union to protect its manufacturers were gradually phased out. As local companies specialized in high-quality fabric began cutting jobs to compete with cheaper foreign imports, Chinese entrepreneurs started renting abandoned Italian warehouses to set up their own factories. Gradually, the Chinese of Prato offered the speed, efficiency and high productivity that many Italian businesses had lacked. Now they export millions of low-cost garments - a woman's cotton shirt sells for under 2 euros, a coat for 12 - across the continent. The Prato branch of Confindustria estimates this business is worth 2 billion euros a year, or half the turnover of Italian-run textile manufacturers in the district. "Between 2001 and 2011, the Italian textile industry in Prato has seen its turnover and its workforce halve. But the reality is we can't really blame the Chinese. The problem is our labor and energy costs mean we can't compete," says Cavicchi. "Speed is crucial. In just three days they can churn out thousands of garments. And the final result - even though it's cheap cloth imported from China - is perfect." Trucks ferry the clothing to shoppers in the major European markets within a day or two. In the fast-changing fashion business, this gives the Prato workshops a competitive edge over rivals in China, which take 40 days to ship their output by sea to Europe. Outside Prato's city walls, the main Via Pistoiese has turned into a bustling Chinatown, with Chinese restaurants, hairdressers, schools, travel agents, and youths practicing the martial art of Tai Chi in the park. For many years, Prato's local government did little about the growing Chinese community, whose presence helps the local economy. "There was a tacit pact to look the other way, because the Chinese were also bringing in a lot of money, helping cushion the impact of the global financial crisis on the region," said Massimo Bressan, a researcher on immigration issues at Prato's Iris institute. When Cenni became Prato's mayor, he promised to restore the rule of law in the city of just under 200,000. In addition to increasing the number of inspections on factories, the local government raised the cost of reclaiming confiscated machinery and introduced a decree that allows a warehouse to be declared "unfit" until it meets safety regulations. But part of the problem is that 60 percent of Chinese workshops last just two years, often closing and reopening under a different name to evade checks by tax authorities. Illegal immigrants found by the police are ordered to leave Italy within five days, but there is no way of making sure that they actually do so, said the city councilor for security, Milone. "It's a joke," he said. Moreover, many illegal immigrants arrive on three-month tourist visas but stay in Italy for a few years, until they make enough money to go back to China. "I have done inspections for 15 years, and I can tell you that for every factory we close, another one will sprout the next day. Here the attitude is too lax, there is a form of connivance," said a judicial police officer who did not want to be named because he is not allowed to talk to the press. Outside the Teresa Moda factory which went up in flames this month, charred coat hangers and rolls of fabric lie scattered on the ground, the remains of burnt black out curtains preventing people from looking inside. "Pain has no color" read a sheet of paper outside the gate taped above pictures of the seven victims, whom police say took days to identify because relatives were too scared to come forward. One of the dead suffocated as he tried to escape through a window guarded by iron bars. A Chinese worker who had come to pay his respects said he made on average 70 shirts a day and was paid 70 cents for each shirt. In a good month, the worker - who said he was afraid to give his name - said he could earn 1,500 euros. Nearby, at the Shen Wu factory workers had regularly sat at their sewing machines for up to 14 hours a day. Li Hong, 29, had been working there for nearly a month, every day, from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. Shen Jianhe was the longest-serving worker at the factory. She had been in Italy for 10 years, and was the only worker there with a residency permit and work contract. "What will happen to my sewing machine? I need it to work," she said, as police began sealing all tools found on the premises. Shen said her children did not live with her at the factory, although children's items - including a storybook with the title "Where is my mummy?" - were strewn across the floor of her windowless, damp cubicle, which measured about 2 square meters and was almost entirely filled by a bed. "Now I need to find another job. I must feed my children," she said.
The media is full of stories about a coming acceleration in U.S. economic growth as we head into 2014. Yet for many, the reality on the ground is not as sunny. So who is feeling the recovery and who isn't? Bloomberg's weekly U.S. Consumer Comfort Index can help answer this question — it tracks consumer confidence across a wide variety of demographic measures, including age, race, gender, income level, and others. The charts below show which Americans are feeling optimistic and which ones aren't.

The New York Stock Exchange publishes end-of-month data for margin debt on the NYXdata website, where we can also find historical data back to 1959. Let's examine the numbers and study the relationship between margin debt and the market, using the S&amp;P 500 as the surrogate for the latter. The first chart shows the two series in real terms â€” adjusted for inflation to today's dollar using the Consumer Price Index as the deflator. I picked 1995 as an arbitrary start date. We were well into the Boomer Bull Market that began in 1982 and approaching the start of the Tech Bubble that shaped investor sentiment during the second half of the decade. The astonishing surge in leverage in late 1999 peaked in March 2000, the same month that the S&amp;P 500 hit its all-time daily high, although the highest monthly close for that year was five months later in August. A similar surge began in 2006, peaking in July, 2007, three months before the market peak. Nominal margin debt is at an all-time high. In real (inflation-adjusted) terms, the latest margin debt is at an interim high, 0.7% below the all-time real high in July 2007. Â  Â  The next chart shows the percentage growth of the two data series from the same 1995 starting date, again based on real (inflation-adjusted) data. I've added markers to show the precise monthly values and added callouts to show the month. Margin debt grew at a rate comparable to the market from 1995 to late summer of 2000 before soaring into the stratosphere. The two synchronized in their rate of contraction in early 2001. But with recovery after the Tech Crash, margin debt gradually returned to a growth rate closer to its former self in the second half of the 1990s rather than the more restrained real growth of the S&amp;P 500. But by September of 2006, margin again went ballistic. It finally peaked in the summer of 2007, about three months before the market. Â  Â  After the market low of 2009, margin debt again went on a tear until the contraction in late spring of 2010. The summer doldrums promptly ended when Chairman Bernanke hinted of more quantitative easing in his August, 2010 Jackson Hole speech. The appetite for margin instantly returned, and the Fed periodically increased the easing until the announced beginning of tapering purchases in January. The latest Margin Data Unfortunately, the NYSE margin debt data is a few weeks old when it is published. Real margin debt at the end of November 2013, the latest available data, is now at a new interim high less than a percent from its all-time high. If the accelerating trend in the two previous peaks offers a clue, margin debt may see some further growth. NYSE Investor Credit Lance Roberts, General Partner &amp; CEO of Streettalk Advisors, analyzes margin debt in the larger context that includes free cash accounts and credit balances in margin accounts. Essentially, he calculates the Credit Balance as the sum of Free Credit Cash Accounts and Credit Balances in Margin Accounts minus Margin Debt. The chart below illustrates the mathematics of Credit Balance with an overlay of the S&amp;P 500. Note that the chart below is based on nominal data, not adjusted for inflation. Â  Â  Here's a slightly closer look at the data, starting with 1995. Also, I've inverted the S&amp;P 500 monthly closes and used markers to pinpoint the monthly close values. Â  Â  As I pointed out above, the NYSE margin debt data is a several weeks old when it is published. Thus, even though it may in theory be a leading indicator, a major shift in margin debt isn't immediately evident. Nevertheless, we see that the troughs in the monthly net credit balance preceded peaks in the monthly S&amp;P 500 closes by six months in 2000 and four months in 2007. The most recent S&amp;P 500 correction greater than 10% was the 19.39% selloff in 2011 from April 29th to October 3rd. Investor Credit hit a negative extreme in March 2011. There are too few peak/trough episodes in in this overlay series to take the latest credit-balance trough as a definitive warning for U.S. equities. But we'll want to keep an eye on this metric in the months ahead.
Real quick – I finally managed to see The Wolf of Wall Street today, thought I’d write up some impressions… For starters, I began in the business on Long Island at the tail-end of that era and I had met a lot of the guys depicted in the film while cold-calling at Duke &amp; Company during the summer after my freshman year. They really were dumbasses and savage maniacs, but to the young guys who didn’t know any better, they were Ferrari-driving gods. Duke &amp; Co was the boiler room spin-off opened and run by ex-Stratton Oakmont guys who had broken away during the regulatory troubles. I’m fairly sure that the Asian character in the movie, “Chester Ming” is meant to portray Victor Wang, one of the founders of Duke (Jordan refers to him as “the depraved Chinaman” in the book). The big irony is that Duke &amp; Co’s office was on Third Avenue in the 50's, next door to the Lipstick Building where, even then in the late 1990's, Bernie Madoff was running his secret (but much larger) fraud all along. I’ve known ten or twelve guys who worked at the Lake Success headquarters of Stratton during its heyday; all the stories are true and there’s very little embellishment in the movie. It all happened and then some. I’ve been hearing these stories for fifteen years. There was a diaspora of sorts that happened after that firm went down, a thousand others had opened up shop as the brokers were scattered like seeds in the wind. Boiler room brokerages had sprung up from Westchester to New Jersey to Staten Island to the Financial District in Manhattan to Boca Raton, Florida. But nowhere was there as heavy a concentration as there was on Long Island. At one point, there was a nickel broker-dealer in every glass office tower in Suffolk and Nassau Counties (and many big buildings had several firms housed on different floors, imagine the stairwells). The scripts used in the movie were the exact same ones taught to every NY metro area broker in the late 1990's. I printed the entire Belfort pitch (which itself had been stolen from the Madison Avenue office of Lehman Brothers) in my book Backstage Wall Street, I’m fairly certain the producers got their hands on it for the film. I doubt Jordan had a copy lying around from twenty years ago. They also used the term “Wildebeest” which is something I use on TV a lot to describe runaway stocks. My friend Paul and I made it up in a finance context five years ago, so I’m flattered, I guess. The great irony that’s not discussed is that Belfort, had he done Wall Street brokerage the legitimate way beginning in the late 1980's, would probably have become a billionaire by now. I could picture him running a hedge fund of funds business or being a brokerage CEO and just selling the shit out of it while other people did all the real work. He could have been a major player legitimately if he wasn’t in such a rush. Leo’s Long Island accent was perfect, so was Jonah’s. And I should know. Don’t be surprised if they start talking like that in real life now, it’s kind of addicting after a while  Margot Robbie as Nadine. Oh my god. The drug stuff was sad/hilarious. Leo’s scene on Lemmon quaaludes might have been the most humorous thing he’s ever done on-screen. The real Jordan Belfort has a cameo at the end where he introduces Leo as Belfort the motivational speaker. He’s tan and fit and undoubtedly having a great time. Not sure how anyone consulting on a biopic of their own life starring and directed by Oscar winners could even be capable of remorse. I found it pretty shocking that they didn’t incorporate one scene showing the victims of this systematic theft. They don’t show the face of a single one, although we hear a handful on the phone. These scenes are played so that the audience is meant to laugh at the “customers” whilst high-fiving with the Wolf and his crew. It’s pretty ugly. The female boiler room broker character was based on a woman I knew named Chrissie. Only she wasn’t just an ordinary “single mom,” she was actually a stripper who was so aggressive that the Strattonites figured she’d be a killer on the phones. She was, until they hauled her out in cuffs from another firm years later over Stratton-era IPOs. There are still a handful of wannabe Belforts and mini-Strattons out there to this day. There are a handful of firms still holding out and doing the whole yelling into the phones while wearing Armani suits thing. A big one was taken down this past summer, but the brokers simply jump to a new firm and start all over again. These days, they can’t take inside rips in penny stocks, so it’s more about churning accounts using real stocks or selling clients private placements. There’s a good chance you’re talking to a boiler room broker if his office is actually located on actual Wall Street. But these guys are dying out. Their licenses are swiss cheese and potential suckers don’t answer their landline phones anymore anyway – hard to con someone over the phone you can’t get in touch with. It’s been over for a while but what else are they going to do? They think Stratton’s coming back someday and they’ll get rich again selling shit over the phone. The movie itself if extremely well made and entertaining. Lots of people are saying it reminds them of Goodfellas and I agree. Maybe even a little more like Casino given the theme – guys who had no business running something that lucrative could never be smart enough to hold on to it without going too far. 100% of teenage boys who see this movie are going to want to grow up to be Jordan. I’m sure Scorsese didn’t set out to accomplish that but it’s inescapable. Oliver Stone didn’t think he was inventing Gordon Gekko to be the role model for a million young would-be finance guys, but that’s exactly what happened. Don’t think Belfort and Danny Porush (on whom Jonah’s character Donny Azoff is said to be based) didn’t have serious Gekko envy, that was the blueprint. Gekko’s like Billy the Kidd in that regard. He’s still quoted, revered and even emulated in every corner of the business world. I recommend seeing it, if you can get past the real moral issues that some have raised. I get the argument against going to see it, but I couldn’t stay away.
REUTERS/Bobby YipOn Christmas Day, someone hacked into two of the largest Dogecoin wallet sites and stole 30 million units of the digital currency. It was a huge blow to a community that prides itself on its lack of rapaciousness. Dogecoin is mostly used to "tip" people on the Internet for performing favors or good deeds. At least two animal shelter groups, one in Florid and one in Spain, also accept the currency.  That same generosity has now produced an incredible attempt to restore faith in Dogecoin's integrity by raising money to compensate people who'd lost funds.  Launched Friday by techie Ben Doernberg, "the 12 days of Dogemas," which is being run out of reddit, has already raised more than 5 million Dogecoins, worth about $2,200. Contributions have come from around the world, and there's a mining pool that's sending 1% of their haul to the effort. In an email, Doernberg says he hopes to raise at least 15 million. "The effort has been successful because respect, support and love is baked into the DNA of dogecoin," Doernberg said. "The doge meme is all about over-the-top positivity and optimism, and dogecoin was started in pursuit of fun and laughter, not greed. A few minutes spent on r/dogecoin will show that there isn't a more welcoming, friendly community anywhere on the Internet." Dogecoin co-founder Billy Markus told us in an email he was amazed by the project. "I've NEVER seen something like this before in cryptocurrency. Usually when something gets hacked the common response is for everyone to call the people who got hacked 'idiots'. To me, this is incredible." Dogecoin's market cap has been cut in half since reaching a high of more than $14 million on December 19. 
ReutersChinese total government debt, including contingent debt which is guaranteed by the government, climbed to 30.3 trillion renminbi (approx $5 trillion) as of mid-2013, according to the latest data from the National Auditing Office.  Local government debt accounts for 17.9 trillion renminbi of the total (about $2.8 trillion). This is up from 10.7 trillion renminbi at the end of 2010. This is up nearly 67% from the last reading of local government debt taken about three years ago. Rising local government debt has had many concerned about an impending financial crisis in China.  Part of the problem is that local governments borrowed from commercial banks and trusts which have high interest rates and short durations, about six months to three years. But these have been used to finance long-term construction projects, many of which don't pay off. Zhang Ke, a senior Chinese auditor rang the alarm back in April, when he told the Financial Times he would no longer sign off on local government bond sales, adding that the debt problem was "out of control."  Bank of America's Ting Lu writes that there are reasons to be concerned about  the rising debt but that he doesn't think a financial crisis is around the corner for five key reasons. Here they are verbatim: Of course this doesn't mean that Beijing has no reason to worry. The pace at which local government debt has grown is grounds for concern.
Instagram/sanfransamOn New Year's Eve you may find yourself drinking with a Wall Streeter or two. Best that you're prepared. These guys are experts. Bankers drink to entertain clients, they drink to entertain themselves (when they have time), and they drink because it's tradition. Wall Street lore has it that before Goldman Sachs went public, its London office had a cellar filled with cases of wine â€” one for each and every child born to a partner. But that's just lore. What's real is that there are rules to drinking like a Wall Streeter. Like any group, they have ideas about the way things should be done, and, more importantly, how they should be drank.
The 2013 mega-rally in the stock market caught Wall Street's top forecasters completely by surprise. And despite just recently publishing their 2014 targets, Wall Street is already being forced to revisit their analyses as the market continues to surge to new all-time highs. Citi's Tobias Levkovich, who published near-term stock market predictions in May and 2014 targets in September, just revised his forecasts. "The S&amp;P 500 has basically achieved its mid-2014 target as tapering delays and fiscal progress have contributed to lower risk premiums and higher P/E multiples," wrote Levkovich. "When laying out a 12-month view in May 2013, the notion of 1,800-1,850 on the S&amp;P 500 by June 2014 was considered likely, but these gains have been pulled forward into 2013." Levkovich now sees the S&amp;P 500 hitting 1,975 in 2014, up from his previous target of 1,900. "The good news from credit conditions, hiring intentions and capital spending plans on the economy and likely earnings growth can provide upside appreciation potential while sentiment, intra-stock correlation and even valuation suggest concern," added Levkovich. "Overall, we can get to a 1,975 kind of outcome, but we may also see choppier markets and early indicators on volatility also intimate reasons to be worried." So while he remains longer-term bullish, he is cautious about the near-term. "The potential for a 5%-10% correction in 1H14 is significant given the likelihood for greater volatility, euphoric investor sentiment, political challenges and the pull forward of equity returns into 2H13," he wrote. Despite these changes and uncertainties, Levkovich's long-term bull thesis is unchanged. "Our Raging Bull Thesis, initiated more than two years ago, argued that a new multi- year secular bull market was expected to begin in 2013 and that view remains intact," he wrote. "Certain aspects of the theory such as positive demographics, the shale gas revolution, US cost competitiveness and required technological mobility investment can last for the better part of this decade and into the 2020s and thus argues for many more years of stock market appreciation."
$0.60 for cake, $1.80 for soap, $3 for broom: Al-Qaida records all expenses, runs like company TIMBUKTU, Mali (AP) â€” The convoy of cars bearing the black al-Qaida flag came at high speed, and the manager of the modest grocery store thought he was about to get robbed. Mohamed Djitteye rushed to lock his till and cowered behind the counter. He was dumbfounded when instead, the al-Qaida commander gently opened the grocery's glass door and asked for a pot of mustard. Then he asked for a receipt. Confused and scared, Djitteye didn't understand. So the jihadist repeated his request. Could he please have a receipt for the $1.60 purchase? This transaction in northern Mali shows what might seem an unusual preoccupation for a terror group: Al-Qaida is obsessed with documenting the most minute expenses. In more than 100 receipts left in a building occupied by al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb in Timbuktu earlier this year, the extremists assiduously tracked their cash flow, recording purchases as small as a single light bulb. The often tiny amounts are carefully written out in pencil and colored pen on scraps of paper and Post-it notes: The equivalent of $1.80 for a bar of soap; $8 for a packet of macaroni; $14 for a tube of super glue. All the documents were authenticated by experts. The accounting system on display in the documents found by The Associated Press is a mirror image of what researchers have discovered in other parts of the world where al-Qaida operates, including Afghanistan, Somalia and Iraq. The terror group's documents around the world also include corporate workshop schedules, salary spreadsheets, philanthropy budgets, job applications, public relations advice and letters from the equivalent of a human resources division. Taken together, the evidence suggests that far from being a fly-by-night, fragmented terror organization, al-Qaida is attempting to behave like a multinational corporation, with what amounts to a company-wide financial policy across its different chapters. "They have to have bookkeeping techniques because of the nature of the business they are in," said Brookings Institution fellow William McCants, a former adviser to the U.S. State Department's Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism. "They have so few ways to keep control of their operatives, to rein them in and make them do what they are supposed to do. They have to run it like a business." The picture that emerges from what is one of the largest stashes of al-Qaida documents to be made public shows a rigid bureaucracy, replete with a chief executive, a board of directors and departments such as human resources and public relations. Experts say that each branch of the terror group replicates the same corporate structure, and that this strict blueprint has helped al-Qaida not just to endure but also to spread. Among the most revealing documents are the receipts, which offer a granular view of how al-Qaida's fighters lived every day as well as its larger priorities. "For the smallest thing, they wanted a receipt," said 31-year-old Djitteye, who runs the Idy Market on the sand-carpeted main boulevard in Timbuktu. "Even for a tin of Nescafe." An inordinate number of receipts are for groceries, suggesting a diet of macaroni with meat and tomato sauce, as well as large quantities of powdered milk. There are 27 invoices for meat, 13 for tomatoes, 11 for milk, 11 for pasta, seven for onions, and many others for tea, sugar, and honey. They record the $0.60 cake one of their fighters ate, and the $1.80 bar of soap another used to wash his hands. They list a broom for $3 and bleach for $3.30. These relatively petty amounts are logged with the same care as the $5,400 advance they gave to one commander, or the $330 they spent to buy 3,300 rounds of ammunition. Keeping close track of expenses is part of al-Qaida's DNA, say multiple experts, including FBI agents who were assigned to track the terror group in the years just after its founding. This habit, they say, can be traced back more than three decades to when a young Osama bin Laden entered King Abdul Aziz University in Saudi Arabia in 1976 to study economics, and went on to run part of his millionaire father's construction company. After he was exiled to Sudan in 1992, bin Laden founded what became the country's largest conglomerate. His companies and their numerous subsidiaries invested in everything from importing trucks to exporting sesame, white corn and watermelons. From the get-go, bin Laden was obsessed with enforcing corporate management techniques on his more than 500 employees, according to al-Qaida expert Lawrence Wright, author of a well-known history of the terror group. Workers had to submit forms in triplicate for even the smallest purchases â€” the same requirement bin Laden later imposed on the first al-Qaida recruits, he said. In Afghanistan, detailed accounting records found in an abandoned al-Qaida camp in 2001 included salary lists, stringent documentation on each fighter, job application forms asking for level of education and language skills, as well as notebook after notebook of expenses. In Iraq, U.S. forces recovered entire Excel spreadsheets, detailing salaries for al-Qaida fighters. "People think that this is done on the back of an envelope. It isn't," says Dan Coleman, a former FBI special agent who was in charge of the bin Laden case file from 1996 to 2004. One of the first raids on an al-Qaida safe house was led by Coleman in 1997. Among the dozens of invoices he found inside the operative's home in Kenya were stacks of gas station receipts, going back eight years. This detailed accounting system allows al-Qaida to keep track of the significant sums of money involved in feeding, training and recruiting thousands of fighters. It's also an attempt to keep track of the fighters themselves, who often operate remotely. The majority of the invoices found on a cement floor in a building in Timbuktu are scribbled by hand, on post-it notes, on lined math paper or on the backs of envelopes, as if operatives in the field were using whatever writing surface they could find. Others are typed, sometimes repeating the same items, in what may serve as formal expense reports for their higher-ups. Al-Qaida clearly required such expense reports â€” in a letter from the stash, middle managers chide a terrorist for not handing his in on time. In informal open-air markets such as those of Timbuktu, vendors didn't have receipts to hand out. So, traders say, members of al-Qaida came in pairs, one to negotiate the sale, and the other to record prices on a notepad. This practice is reflected in the fact that almost all the receipts are written in Arabic, a language few residents of Timbuktu know how to write. The fighters would ask for a price, and then write it down in their Bloc Note, a notebook brand sold locally, said pharmacist Ibrahim Djitteye. "It surprised me at first," he said. "But I came to the conclusion that they are here for a very specific mission.... And when you are on assignment, you need to give a report. They have their own higher-ups, who are expecting them to account for what they spent." The corporate nature of the organization is also on display in the types of activities they funded. For example, two receipts, for $4,000 and $6,800, are listed as funds for "workshops," another concept borrowed from business. A flier found in another building occupied by their fighters confirms that al-Qaida held the equivalent of corporate training retreats. It lists detailed schedules: Early morning exercise from 5 to 6:30 a.m.; lessons on how to use a GPS from 10 to 10:30 a.m.; arms training from 10:30 a.m. to noon; and various afternoon classes on preaching to other Muslims, nationalism and democracy. A relatively small ratio of the receipts are expense reports for fighters and weapons. One unit presented a politely worded request for funds, entitled: "The list of names of mujahideen who are asking for clothes and boots to protect themselves from the cold." Far more deal with the mundane aspects of running a state, such as keeping the lights on. Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb invaded Timbuktu in April 2012, and took over its state-run utilities, paying to have fuel trucked in from neighboring Algeria. One invoice shows they paid $3,720 for 20 barrels of diesel for the city's power station. There's also an advance for the prison and a detailed budget for the Islamic Tribunal, where judges were paid $2 per day to hear cases. Along with the nuts and bolts of governing, it's clear that the fighters were actively trying to woo the population. They set aside money for charity: $4 for medicine "for a Shiite with a sick child," and $100 in financial aid for a man's wedding. And they reimbursed residents for damages, such as $50 for structural repairs, with a note that the house in question "was hit by mujahideen cars." And it's obvious that the fighters spent a good part of their time proselytizing, with expense reports for trips to distant villages to impart their ultra-strict vision of Islam. One receipt bluntly lists $200 for a "trip for spreading propaganda." While not overtly explained, the sizable receipts for car repairs suggest regular missions into the desert. The many receipts for oil changes, car batteries, filters and parts indicate the tough terrain battered the fighters' Toyota Land Cruisers. Finally, the names on the receipts reveal the majority of fighters on the group's payroll were foreign-born. There's a $1,000 advance to a man identified as "Talhat the Libyan." Another is issued to "Tarek the Algerian." The names furthermore confirm that the top leaders of al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb were based in Timbuktu. Among them is Abou Zeid, probably the most feared of al-Qaida's local commanders who orchestrated the kidnappings of dozens of Westerners until his death this spring. "In the name of Allah, the most merciful," begins a request for funds dated Dec. 29, 2012, and addressed to Abou Zeid. "We are writing to inform you that we need rockets for our camp â€” a total of 4 is needed. May God protect you." The extent of the documentation found here, as well as in the other theaters where al-Qaida operates, does not mean the terror group runs as a well-oiled machine, cautions Jason Burke, author of the book "Al-Qaida." "Bureaucracy, as we know, gives senior managers the illusion they are in control of distant subordinates," Burke said. "But that influence is much, much less than they would like." Al-Qaida's accounting practices left a strong impression on at least one person in Timbuktu: Djitteye, the convenience store manager. The al-Qaida commander who came in for mustard was Nabil Alqama, the head of al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb's "Southern Command." He became a regular. One day, he asked the store employee to get a receipt book printed so he could provide more official-looking invoices. Djitteye obliged. The green receipt book with neat boxes now sits under his cash register. These days, whenever customers come in, he always asks if they would like a receipt. No one ever does. ___ The documents can be viewed here: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/998496-the-multinational.html Copyright (2013) Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Flickr/kryptoPaul Krugman set off a new firestorm this weekend with a post about Bitcoin that asked a fairly simple question: What gives a bitcoin its worth? The post drew a ton of angry reaction from the Internet community and tech people for a couple of reasons. One is that this question — why is a bitcoin worth anything — is a difficult question to answer. The other is that the post is bizarrely titled "Bitcoin Is Evil" even though the post doesn't say that. But on the Internet, people don't read past the headline and so, outrage! But back to the question of trying to establish an "intrinsic value" for Bitcoin. It's not simple. The dollar has intrinsic value because you need dollars to pay taxes in the United States. The government accepts no other currency. So if you're going to engage in any kind of commerce whatsoever, you need to use dollars. This creates real value for the currency. Gold has real value because it's shiny and can be used for jewelry. Other commodities get their value from industrial purposes. But what about Bitcoin? If you ask Bitcoin believers why a bitcoin is worth anything at all, they will tell you about how amazing the technology is, and how it's "programmable" and how cryptography and pseudoanonymity are so great. But none of these are very satisfying answers. Litecoin.orgWhy Litecoin believes its superior.For one thing, these features mainly explain why Bitcoin as a payment platform is so intriguing. They don't explain price. And as Krugman even notes in his original post, most of the techie Bitcoin bulls usually talk about Bitcoin as a platform (something that's easy to defend), rather than Bitcoin as an asset that will go up or down. Furthermore, if Bitcoin's value were simply a function of all of the technological aspects, then there's no reason that Bitcoin wouldn't easily be supplanted by another crypto-currency that has better features (even the Bitcoin bulls will acknowledge that the technology could be better, particularly on the mining side and the confirmation time). For example Litecoin, the second-biggest player in the game, advertises that if you transact in Litecoin you get faster confirmation times and that the whole system can handle more volume than Bitcoin.  So the usual arguments aren't that compelling. Now in the Bitcoin-sphere, there's a lot of debate about what Bitcoin is. People go 'round and 'round in circles about whether Bitcoin is a currency or a commodity or a platform or a protocol or an equity or whatever. These squabbles frequently get semantic (What is a currency? Must it be a stable store of value?) and usually they suffer from an inclination to plug Bitcoin into a category where it never quite fits. I think Bitcoin is a hybrid of three things with which we're all pretty familiar: a currency, an equity, and a social network. The currency part is pretty easy to understand. Someone is offering something for sale like a bike or a month's rent, and they might give you a quote in dollars, yen and bitcoins. Bitcoin basically acts like a currency then. Bitcoin also has equity-like characteristics in that the value seems to grow as the whole Bitcoin ecosystem grows. The value of a bitcoin is up about 50x this year, which is an insane swing for a currency, but if you think about it as equity in a hot startup, it's not that preposterous when coming off of a low base. Bitcoins also have market cap (see: CoinMarketCap). And most crucially, there's a social networking element to it (this is something Antonis Polemitis has written on). Bitcoin is something that's valued because lots of people use it. It's not that different from Napster. Napster was game-changing technology in terms of how people get music, but it only had value once it was used by a lot of people. Same with Facebook. The technology may not have been better than its predecessors, but it got a lot of people using it, and suddenly the platform became tremendously valuable. Strong, robust network effects are crucial for making the whole thing work. Let's go through why ... Let's say you're a Chinese millionaire, and you're looking to take a big hunk of your fortune out of the country. This is not a trivial problem. The Chinese government has strict controls about wiring money out of the banking system. One way to get money out is to give your money to something called a "junket operator." That junket operator will give you a bunch of chips to go gamble with in Macau. Then after you're done gambling you take your remaining chips, cash them out for the local Macau currency (the Pataca) and then deposit those Pataca in a bank in Macau where that money is not burdened by capital controls. But that's difficult in part because you're dealing with a shady junket operator who might have ties to the criminal underworld. Then you have to gamble and play a huge cut to the casino. And then there's all the travel. Another way you can get money out of the country is by buying a bunch of Rolex watches and putting them on all your wrists and ankles, and then flying out of the country and selling them to someone outside of China and then depositing that cash in a foreign bank. But like all luxury goods, the Rolexes are likely to lose a lot of value the second you take them out of the store. And do you really feel safe traveling with all those watches on you? It's a dicey enterprise. The hot new way to evade capital controls is to buy bitcoins, and then slip them to another wallet connected to a bank account in some other country. Then sell the bitcoins to a buyer and deposit that money in a bank somewhere. The government would have an extremely hard time tracking this down (which is why lately the governments of China and India) have grown more negative on Bitcoin. This is a low-cost solution, but it's not risk-free. As we've seen, Bitcoin is volatile, so you could experience a big price swing. But even if you can stomach the price swing, you have to be certain that there will be buyers for millions in Bitcoin on the other end of the transaction. This is only assured with big network effects. DogecoinDespite the technological similarity, our Chinese millionaire could not conduct the same transaction with Dogecoin. The value of all the Dogecoins in the world is just $7 million, so if you wanted to move $1 million, you'd need to suck up one-seventh of all the money in Dogecoin. It would be way too big a gamble. Other crypto currencies have total "market caps" much less than $1 million. So then you literally could not execute the transaction despite equivalent — or in some cases superior — technology associated with other coins.  Without the network effects, the technology is nothing. It's just a theoretical amusement. The question then becomes: Can the social network last? If it can, then the value can be maintained, or might grow by even a lot. But history is not on Bitcoin's side on this question. For one thing, no social network seems to have much lasting power ... especially not the first in a given category (Napster, MySpace, ICQ, etc). This also doesn't satisfy what gives Bitcoin a "floor" in value — but then an equity never has a floor. Equity can go to zero, but that doesn't mean that in the meantime it's not worth something. Bringing it all back home: A lot of Bitcoin skeptics are willing to accept that there's something technologically interesting going on here (Paul Krugman even posted a followup to his "evil" post talking about what kinds of problems the Bitcoin technology solves). But the economics of it are more tenuous. But if the network of people remains, Bitcoin may keep solving problems, like the problem of getting money out of a restrictive country.

Sign up to receive it in your inbox every morning.Â  Click here to sign up for Payment Insights today! A BIG RETAILER WARMS UP TO BITCOIN: Overstock.com CEO Patrick Byrne says that Overstock will begin accepting Bitcoin sometime in June. According to The New York Times, Byrne said that â€œsome fraction, tiny now, of the populationâ€ currently wants to transact using a digital currency like Bitcoin. He also appeared intrigued by the currency's structure, which places strict parameters that guide the amount of Bitcoin that can be created: â€œYou want money to be based on something that no government mandarin can wish into existence with the stroke of a pen.â€ Byrne said the company would protect itself from oscillations in Bitcoin's value with derivatives. (The New York Times) MOM-AND-POPS LOVE BITCOIN: Already, there's many small businesses across the U.S. and Europe that accept Bitcoin. This includes bodegas and barber shops in New York , according to The New York Post. Daniel Lee, who owns bodegas, restaurants, and a nail salon in Brooklyn, has been accepting the digital currency since March: " â€¦ He now counts between five and 10 bitcoin transactions a day among his businesses. Though this makes up 'probably not even 1 percent' of his business, Lee said, accepting the currency is beneficial." Apparently, there are two big benefits to accepting bitcoin, a low processing fee of 1% â€”Â  compared to over 2% for conventional credit cards â€” and no charge-backs, which is when a customer later disputes a credit card payment. (The New York Post) E-COMMERCE SITES, TOO: Shopify, an e-commerce platform, has allowed its 75,000 online retailers to accept Bitcoin as of November. Beloved and Mindzai are among Shopify-powered e-commerce sites already accepting Bitcoin. (Shopify) Meanwhile, Bitcoin platform Coinbase has released software that allows any retailer to accept Bitcoin at point-of-sale. (Coinbase) In other news â€¦ IS BITCOIN EVIL?: Paul Krugman has set off a huge debate on the Internet about Bitcoin after publishing a Dec. 28 column, provocatively headlined "Bitcoin Is Evil," in which he stated that Bitcoin might be OK as a medium of exchange but it is a terrible store of value. Plus, Krugman argued, he doesn't like Bitcoin's agenda. He quoted this bit from author Charlie Stross to make his case: "Bitcoin looks like it was designed as a weapon intended to damage central banking and money-issuing banks, with a Libertarian political agenda in mindâ€”to damage states ability to collect tax and monitor their citizens' financial transactions." (The New York Times) THE KRUGMAN-BITCOIN SAGA CONTINUED: In order to discredit Krugman's view and paint him as clueless on tech, Bitcoin fans circulated a quote from 1998 in which Krugman compared the Internet to the fax machine and said its growth would slow "drastically." Krugman, no slouch when it comes to Internet fights, issued a response: "The issues about Bitcoin â€¦ are not technological! Everyone agrees that it's technically very sweet. But does it work as money? That's a very different kind of question." (Business Insider)BITCOIN MICROPAYMENTS ON TWITTER: A new startup, TipperCoin, "allows users to send bitcoins by posting a Twitter message containing the hashtag #TipperCoin ... Users cannot send bitcoins through retweets and are encouraged not to store too many bitcoins in the account, which is meant for tipping." (Payments Source) TARGET UPDATE: After initially minimizing claims of stolen personal identification numbers, Target has admitted that encrypted PIN numbers were stolen by hackers' malware installed on Target's point-of-sale systems during a security breach between Nov. 27 and Dec. 15. But Target, in its fourth media update on the breach, says the PINs that were stolen can't actually be used: "The PIN information was fully encrypted at the keypad, remained encrypted within our system, and remained encrypted when it was removed from our systems." (Target) RUSSIAN PAYMENTS COMPANY EXPANDS: Qiwi, which provides offline, online and mobile payments solutions, (and claims to have deployed 15 million "virtual wallets") has acquired Blestgroup, which places terminals at retailers. (Investor's Business Daily) MORE RUMORS OF TROUBLES AT CLINKLE: Valleywag excerpts bits from a Quora post alleging that mobile payments startup Clinkle has been mismanaged by twenty-something CEO Lucas Duplan. The problems supposedly range from miscommunication about salaries, fund-raising, and options, to frustration over constantly shifting goal posts for when the platform will actually launch. In a June 2013 blog post, Duplan summarized Clinkle's goal: "There are close to one million apps in the Apple App Store. Yet, none let you comfortably go a week or even a couple of days without paper bills or plastic cards." Clinkle has raised over $20 million, much of it from big-name investors including Sir Richard Branson.

Workers in Harbin, China are gearing up for the city's 30th annual Harbin Ice and Snow Festival, a massive installation of sculptures and buildings made from ice.  The festival officially begins January 5th. According to organizers, nearly 10,000 workers will build the palatial structures, using some 180,000 square meters of ice and 150,000 square meters of snow, according to Reuters. Among other structures being prepared for this year's festival, one ice fortress appears to emulate a branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the nation’s largest bank, according to Quartz. REUTERS/Sheng Li  For reference, here's the ICBC building in Tianjin. The logo on the ice structure is spot-on: en.wikipedia.org Expect to see some other incredible art at the festival, which utilizes lasers and ice lanterns to make the ice sculptures glow at night.

Wikimedia CommonsJane Austen.Steven Englander, Citi's global head of G10 FX strategy, unearthed several insights on monetary policy from the work of famed novelist Jane Austen. He sent out the following quotes (and their real meanings) in a brief note: "Elinor now found the difference between the expectation of an unpleasant event, however certain the mind may be told to consider it, and certainty itself." â€” the market reaction to tapering "Finish it at once. Let there be an end of this suspense. Fix, commit, condemn yourself." â€” more on tapering "A watch is always too fast or too slow. I cannot be dictated to by a watch." â€” on the tapering calendar "I have not wanted syllables where actions have spoken so plainly."Â â€” advice on communications policy "I think we are a great deal better employed, sitting comfortably here among ourselves, and doing nothing." â€” insight into labor force participation "I do not think it worthwhile to wait for enjoyment until there is some real opportunity for it." â€” the hysteresis effect "A large income is the best recipe for happiness I ever heard of." â€”Â on the need for more stimulus "I am sorry to tell you that I am getting very extravagant and spending all my money: and what is worse for you, I have been spending yours too." â€” message to Congress "If this man had not twelve thousand a year, he would be a very stupid fellow." â€”Â the importance of the wealth effect for human capital "Money is the best recipe for happiness."Â â€” QE justified "If things are going untowardly one month, they are sure to mend the next." â€” on economic forecasting "There is a monstrous deal of stupid quizzing, &amp; common-place nonsense talked, but scarcely any wit." â€” FOMC press conferences "It would be most right, and most wise, and, therefore must involve least suffering." â€” taking the easy policy route "We do not look in great cities for our best morality." â€” distribution effects of QE "I don't approve of surprises.

One of the hottest debates among experts covering the markets and the economy is over the sustainability of record high profit margins. Goldman Sachs' Jan Hatzius offered his forecast for margins in his "10 Questions for 2014" note. "Will profit margins contract?" asked Hatzius. "No." "As shown in Exhibit 10, the most important driver of profit margins is the gap between price inflation and unit labor cost inflation," he added. "When prices grow faster than unit labor costs, firms typically manage to raise their profit margins, and vice versa. In our view, the price/ULC gap is likely to move back into slightly positive territory in 2014." Hatzius expects wage growth to stay low at least in the near-term. "[T]he underlying trend calculated from the three primary measures of hourly wagesâ€”average hourly earnings, the employment cost index, and compensation per hourâ€”is still only growing 2%," added Hatzius. "Going forward, we expect only a modest acceleration to perhaps 2.5%. Meanwhile, we expect productivity growth to reaccelerate to 1.5%-2%. Together, these numbers imply unit labor cost growth of 0.5%-1%, which would be slightly below the rate of price inflation of 1%-1.5%." Labor market slack is one of the main reasons why economists believe inflation will stay low for a while. But getting back to profit margin dynamics, we know that wage growth is only part of the story. "Of course, the price/ULC gap is not the only driver of margins," continued Hatzius. "But other factors are also likely to look reasonably friendly. We expect foreign profits to improve in 2014 as the global economy gathers some momentum, and see no major changes in corporate income taxes or financial profits." Goldman Sachs
Monthly jobs data released by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics are following an unusual pattern: volatility in the numbers is at its lowest level since 1997. "If there's a theme to close the year with, it's the lack of volatility in the monthly U.S. nonfarm payroll data," says Kit Juckes, a global strategist at SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale. "The firstÂ FridayÂ of the month has seldom been so dull." The blue line in the chart below shows the rolling 12-month standard deviation of the monthly change in nonfarm payrolls. In November, the measure stood at 59,000, the lowest since August 1997's 45,000 reading â€” and as the chart shows, it has been lowerÂ only a handful of times in the post-war period. The red line shows the average rolling 12-month standard deviation over the last 30 years (115,000). For now, slow and steady is the name of the game when it comes to payroll growth in the United States. Business Insider/Matthew Boesler (data from St. Louis Fed)
Screenshot via Bloomberg.comHedge fund giant David Tepper made a ridiculous amount of money in 2013. Michelle Celarier at the NY Post reports: It could be one heckuva New Year’s Eve party for hedge fund titan David Tepper — again. The founder of Appaloosa Management, with more than $20 billion under management, is looking at a possible $3 billion-plus payday in 2013, which could make him the highest paid hedgie. Why did Tepper do so well? Because as we've explained earlier this year, he's a Democrat. Why does that make sense? Here's the deal. A lot of big macro hedge fund managers have had a terrible time of it in recent years because they've been so negative on policy for political reasons. They hate Bernanke. They hate high deficits. They hate Obamacare. They hate "redistribution." And when you're negative on policy it's hard to feel good and just go with the flow and buy stocks. Conversely, if you don't have any reason to hate policy, you're not going to let your investments be burdened by all kinds of nonsense ideas. Now it's certainly possible to hate policy and be long and it's possible to like policy but be wrong on the market. But many big time hedge fund managers have had a hard time of it because they've let politics get in the way. That wasn't an issue for Tepper, and now he'll be raking in the cash.
Mandatory Credit: Matthew Emmons-USA TODAY The Dallas Federal Reserve's manufacturing index survey climbed to 3.1 for December. Consensus was for a reading of 4.0, compared with 1.9 last month. The employment index was 6.8, up slightly from its November level. Seventeen percent of firms reported hiring new workers compared with 10 percent reporting layoffs. This morning we got an unexpectedly weak Pending Home Sales print front the National Association of Realtors.Â  Full release:Â  Texas factory activity increased for the eighth month in a row in December, according to business executives responding to the Texas Manufacturing Outlook Survey. TheÂ productionÂ index, a key measure of state manufacturing conditions, fell from 16.9 to 7.1, indicating output grew at a slower pace than in November. Other measures of current manufacturing activity reflected slower or no growth. TheÂ new ordersÂ index came in near zero, suggesting demand was largely unchanged from November after seven months of increases. TheÂ shipmentsÂ index also fell to around zero, coming in at 0.7, after rising to 14.8 last month. TheÂ capacity utilizationÂ index declined 8 points to 8.6. Perceptions of broader business conditions were more optimistic in December. TheÂ general business activityÂ index posted its seventh consecutive positive reading and edged up to 3.1. TheÂ company outlookÂ index also posted its seventh positive reading in a row and shot up 7.5 points to 15.5, its highest level in nearly two years. Labor market indicators reflected increased hiring but slightly shorter workweeks. The DecemberÂ employmentÂ index was 6.8, up slightly from its November level. Seventeen percent of firms reported hiring new workers compared with 10 percent reporting layoffs. TheÂ hours workedÂ index dipped to a reading ofÂ -2, suggesting a slight decrease in average workweek length. Upward pressure on prices and wages picked up in December. TheÂ raw materials priceÂ index rose 10 points to 32.8, with a third of firms noting an increase in input costs. TheÂ finished goods priceÂ index moved up from 2.2 to 5.9. Compensation costs increased at a faster pace this month, with theÂ wages and benefitsÂ index increasing to 21.6, its highest level since July 2012. Looking ahead, 46 percent of respondents anticipate further increases in raw materials prices over the next six months, while 44 percent expect higher finished goods prices, the highest share since 2008. Expectations regarding future business conditions were notably more optimistic in December. The index of futureÂ general business activityÂ spiked 16 points to 22.8, reaching its highest reading in nearly three years. The index of futureÂ company outlookÂ rose to 24.1, a 21-month high. Indexes for future manufacturing activity also pushed further into positive territory. The Dallas Fed conducts the Texas Manufacturing Outlook Survey monthly to obtain a timely assessment of the stateâ€™s factory activity. Data were collected Dec. 17â€“24, and 87 Texas manufacturers responded to the survey. Firms are asked whether output, employment, orders, prices and other indicators increased, decreased or remained unchanged over the previous month. Survey responses are used to calculate an index for each indicator. Each index is calculated by subtracting the percentage of respondents reporting a decrease from the percentage reporting an increase. When the share of firms reporting an increase exceeds the share reporting a decrease, the index will be greater than zero, suggesting the indicator has increased over the prior month. If the share of firms reporting a decrease exceeds the share reporting an increase, the index will be below zero, suggesting the indicator has decreased over the prior month. An index will be zero when the number of firms reporting an increase is equal to the number of firms reporting a decrease. Data have beenÂ seasonally adjustedÂ as necessary.

REUTERS/Richard ClementPending home sales climbed 0.2% month-over-month in November. But were down 4% on the year. This missed economists' expectations for a 1% monthly rise and 0.1% year-over-year fall. There were also downward revisions to October's data, with pending home sales falling 1.2% on the month, and 2.7% on the year. This compares with an initial reading of a 2.2% YoY fall in October, and a 0.6% month-over-month fall. "We may have reached a cyclical low because the positive fundamentals of job creation and household formation are likely to foster a fairly stable level of contract activity in 2014," Lawrence Yun, chief economist at NAR, said in a press release."Although the final months of 2013 are finishing on a soft note, the year as a whole will end with the best sales total in seven years." Here's a look at the regional breakdown: Pending home sales have been falling for four straight months on account of tighter inventory, declining affordability, and elevated mortgage rates. The index is considered to be a leading indicator for future existing home sales. The Commerce Department expects that 80% of signings will become existing home sales transactions within two months.
United AirlinesNo one likes big airlines.SomeÂ companies just canâ€™t make their customers happy, and many of the companies are the kind that customers find it hardest to escape. The latest survey results from theÂ American Consumer Satisfaction Index (ACSI), which looks at hundreds of big companies,Â show that telecom companies, airlines, and social media sites are most likely to frustrate people. In defense of these industries, no one notices them when things go well, but people get outraged when they lose service or get stuck for hours at an airport. On the other hand, these industries often have customers locked down and don't have to worry about making them happy.
Daniel Goodman / Business Insider.comI'm really in favor of the practice of writers issuing Mea Culpas at the end of the year. It's good for crushing one's own ego, and it's just good for accountability in general. I actually already wrote one for the year, wherein I changed my mind about Bitcoin from being extremely negative to being more neutral and open minded. But now I'm doing another one: I was wrong about the Fed! Specifically: I underestimated the Fed's power to boost the economy under current conditions. For the past several years, I've been supportive of the Fed doing whatever it could to boost the economy, but mostly I've subscribed to the view of Richard Koo, the economist who has pushed the notion of a "balance sheet recession." Koo's view has been that in a period when the private sector was inclined to reduce debt (deleverage) that monetary policy is ineffective, and that the solution is fiscal stimulus and more fiscal stimulus. Basically, the public sector must engage in deeper deficits in order to replenish private sector balance sheets, so that businesses and households wouldn't have such a strong inclination to want to reduce debt. There's a lot to be said for this view, that when interest rates drop to 0%, and people are paying down debt, that fiscal stimulus must be a huge part of the mix and that monetary policy loses its effectiveness. Part of the evidence for this view is that the recent recovery has been quite weak, while fiscal policy has actually been quite tight! This chart from the Cleveland Fed shows that the trajectory of government spending has been far weaker than it has been in previous recoveries. Cleveland Fed And it's hard to look at this chart from Calculated Risk  — which shows the trajectory of public sector employment across various recoveries — and not conclude that all the public sector layoffs have been a major drag on the recovery. Calculated Risk It's really hard to dispute that tight fiscal policy and austerity has hurt the economy. But the view that fiscal policy was pretty much the only game in town was too severe. 2013 provided a nice opportunity to test whether the Fed could help the economy in the midst of fiscal retrenchment. 2013 was the year that the "sequestration" kicked in (these were the spending cuts that were mandated by the debt ceiling deal of 2011). Also in 2013 (well, late 2012 actually), the Fed engaged in its boldest monetary stimulus yet. The Fed announced open-ended QE (previous rounds of QE were limited in size) and it also announced "Evan's Rule" which stated that the Fed would not even consider raising rates until unemployment fell to at least 6.5%. This is actually a very elegant promise, because it means that Fed policy automatically adjusts to the changing environment. If the unemployment rate were to rise, it implies instantly looser Fed policy, since it means a longer period of time until the first rate hike. So 2013 was a great year for economic experimentation, which is something that many commentators noticed early on. In April, Mike Konczal wrote for Wonkblog on The great economic experiment of 2013: Ben Bernanke vs. austerity. As 2013 wraps up, you have to say that Bernanke did pretty well for himself! The economy is operating at its best level since the crisis. The deleveraging has come to an end, and the pace of job creation has kicked into a new, higher gear. One year of course isn't definitive (there were already signs of the deleveraging coming to an end last year, and a lot of the austerity in 2013 was front-loaded, so the experiment wasn't that clean to begin with). But the economy has clearly done better than I and a lot of other people would have guessed given the austerity, and it seems likely that the Fed played a role. Why did monetary policy work, even in a deleveraging? I believe Paul Krugman got at the answer in a post back in April, 2010:  But Koo says no — he’s dead set against any form of monetary expansion or inflation targeting, even as a supplement to fiscal policy. His position seems to be that interest rates literally make no difference whatsoever when you’re in a balance-sheet recession ... I don’t understand this. Maybe the relationship gets steeper, because many corporations and/or households are balance-sheet constrained. But all of them? The economy is a big, complicated place; surely there’s some margin somewhere. In other words, sure a lot of players in the economy are paying down debt, and need cash from the government to heal their balance sheets. But some businesses are expanding, and some people are looking to move into a house, and easing credit for them makes a difference. And it's not just in the U.S. that those who believe in the power of the central bank have done well. Japan may be turning a corner economically thanks to Abenomics, which involves aggressive monetary easing. The U.K. is turning around. And Europe's efforts to repair its banking system have helped stem the crisis (although the Eurozone is such a disaster for so many reasons that it's hard to pin the crash or the stability on any one thing). Bottom line though is that as 2013 comes to an end, I'm more monetarist than I was at the beginning of 2013. Now of course a Mea Culpa isn't very compelling unless you go back and identify where you said something specifically wrong, otherwise it's just blather for the sake of faux humility. But I'm too lazy to find all of my exact wording on all these issues. But I do remember one post from 2011 where I called out conservative pundit Ramesh Ponnuru and economist David Beckworth for being too confident that monetary policy could revive the economy (if done right). I still think that fiscal stimulus is an important part of the mix (or at least that the austerity we've seen has been disastrous), but I don't think the Fed is as ineffective as I used to think.
This comes after the troubled footwear maker announced private equity giant Blackstone had plunked down $200 million to take a 13% stake in the company. The investment will allow Crocs to finance a $350 million stock repurchase program that will reduce tradeable shares by 30%. "We expect these initiatives to reduce volatility in both our common stock price and our shareholder base and provide a strong foundation to unlock long-term value for our shareholders," said Crocs chief financial officer Jeff Lasher. Shares closed at $13.33 Friday.
Tech people have been passing around this 1998 quote from Paul Krugman where he compared the Internet to a fax machine: "The growth of the Internet will slow drastically, as the flaw in 'Metcalfe's law'â€“which states that the number of potential connections in a network is proportional to the square of the number of participantsâ€“becomes apparent: most people have nothing to say to each other! By 2005 or so, it will become clear that the Internet's impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine's." The reason people are dredging up this old quote is that Krugman jokingly said Bitcoin is Evil. He doesn't think it's evil,Â but he is skeptical that Bitcoin can be a real store of money, and actually work as a currency.Â  As a way to discredit his thoughts on Bitcoin everyone is passing around that old quote about the Internet. The implication isÂ See! He was wrong once! Thereforehence, he is a bozo and you shouldn't listen to him! We emailed Krugman for a comment on the quote and here's his explanation: Well, two things. First, look at the whole piece. It was a thing for the Times magazine's 100th anniversary, written as if by someone looking back from 2098, so the point was to be fun and provocative, not to engage in careful forecasting; I mean, there are lines in there about St. Petersburg having more skyscrapers than New York, which was not a prediction, just a thought-provoker. But the main point is that I don't claim any special expertise in technology -- I almost never make technological forecasts, and the only reason there was stuff like that in the 98 piece was because the assignment required that I do that sort of thing. The issues about Bitcoin, however, are not technological! Everyone agrees that it's technically very sweet. But does it work as money? That's a very different kind of question. And the fact that people are throwing around my 98 quote actually shows that they don't get this point -- that they're confusing technology with monetary economics.
REUTERS/Jim YoungAny way you look at it, deflation is scary.For the Wal-Mart shopper, falling prices is a great thing because it means saving money. However, that marketing message only works for Wal-Mart if the shopper actually buys the good. This dynamic represents the complexity of deflation. Intuitively, consumers may believe deflation is good because falling prices means saving money. However, it comes with significant behavioral implications which could cause an entire economy to stagnate or even spiral. It's why the Federal Reserve has promised to keep monetary policy easy as long as inflation remains below target. Economist Gary Shilling explains in plain English: Why does the Fed clearly fear deflation? Steadily declining prices can induce buyers to wait for still-lower prices. So, excess capacity and inventories result and force prices lower. That confirms suspicions and encourages buyers to wait even further. Those deflationary expectations are partly responsible for the slow economic growth in Japan for two decades. It's a self-reinforcing cycle, and it's hard to stop. Japan is now experimenting with ultra-aggressive monetary and fiscal policy in its effort to stimulate its economy by devaluing its currency and stoking inflation. In the U.S., inflation continues to be very low, which is why economists like Shilling warn about deflation risks. For now, it appears that there are more inflationary risks than deflationary risks.
Paul Krugman upset the Bitcoin community over the weekend when he wrote a blog post titled "Bitcoin is Evil." In the post he said he was "deeply unconvinced" that Bitcoin can actually work as a form of currency. He doesn't think it works as a "store of value" because there isn't anything underpinning it.  After writing the post, Bitcoin supporters started flogging his inbox with "rage-filled missives," says Krugman in a follow up post. He also said that the Bitcoin people have no sense of humor, and he suggested his "Bitcoin is Evil" headline was a "joke." In his defense, he really didn't write a post about why it was "evil," he just said he was skeptical that Bitcoin could work. In addition to jamming his inbox with angry emails people in the tech world have started passing around his dreadful prediction from 1998 about the impact of the Internet.  Here's the image which we've seen tweeted: Imgur We emailed Krugman for a comment about this old quote. His response: Well, two things. First, look at the whole piece. It was a thing for the Times magazine's 100th anniversary, written as if by someone looking back from 2098, so the point was to be fun and provocative, not to engage in careful forecasting; I mean, there are lines in there about St. Petersburg having more skyscrapers than New York, which was not a prediction, just a thought-provoker.

And the fact that people are throwing around my 98 quote actually shows that they don't get this point -- that they're confusing technology with monetary economics. And speaking of confusing tech and economics, he had a third blog post on Bitcoin that was basically just an email from a friend. The email is one of the better explanations of why tech people are so excited about Bitcoin. Here's an excerpt: It occurs to me that part of the disconnect is that Bitcoin solved a major technical problem, one that people had been thinking about for about 20 years, and we nerds just can’t believe that it doesn’t also solve an economic problem. The technical problem is double spending–if I have some digital money, it’s easy enough to verify cryptographically that it’s real, but if I give it to you, how can you tell that I haven’t also given it to someone else? Until Bitcoin, the answer was to have a bank that knew which coins were valid, so you’d present my coin to the bank, which would check its database and if it’s valid, cancel it and give you a new one. Bitcoin has its decentralized blockchain which is a very clever recasting of the problem so that the state of the “bank” is whatever the majority of bitcoin miners agree that it is. Getting enough of the miners to agree is known as the Byzantine Generals problem, and has a technical history of its own. So with this breakthrough, we must have an economic breakthrough? We don’t? Well, then you just don’t understand/are in the pocket of the illuminati/whatever.  Read the whole thing &gt;
FRED The above chart shows the year-over-year change in the price of an ounce in gold. As you can see, this was the first year in over a decade that gold was down for the year. Not only did it fall, but it fell big. Everyone in the world should be happy about this development. There's a few reasons for this: -- The most obvious reason to be happy is one simply of direct observation: Gold crashed because the economy is returning to normal. People no longer feel as though everything is going to collapse. The US is doing okay, the European crisis is over, and there aren't major fears of a hard landing in China. For now there's no strong reason to think the global financial system could collapse.  -- A secondary effect of lower gold prices is that there's less urgency to spend labor and energy digging up gold from the ground. Watching people spend lots of resources to dig up useless rocks is a sad thing for the world, so lower prices has a nice knock-on benefits. -- But the real reason we should be happy with the gold crash is that it proves the worth of the corpus of economic knowledge we've built up over all these years. If large government deficits and QE had resulted in hyperinflation and gold going to $10,000 then we'd pretty much have to do the drawing board in terms of what we know about the economy, and how we can prevent future crisis. The fact that the gold fever popped is a demonstrate that contra the angry-Austrian, hard-money cranks, the conventional view of the economy is more-or-less correct. And that knowledge is worth trillions (as evidenced by the fact that that knowledge quickly got the US out of the worst slowdown since the Great Depression). Gold's crashing represents an exit from the crisis mentality, and it vindicates the value of thousands of human-years worth of economic understanding, which may be incalculable. This is something everyone can be happy about.
Art Cashin, UBS's veteran NYSE trader and indisputable Wall Street legend, has a couple of traditions. Among his more popular traditions are his year-end poems, wrapping up highlights from the year.

Hulton Archive /Getty ImagesThere was no "catalyst" in 1929. Or 1966. Or 1987. Or 2000. Or 2008...The stock market continues to push higher, on route to posting one of the best years in history. This advance comes in the fifth year of recovery from the financial crisis, and it has seen the S&amp;P 500 nearly triple off its low of March, 2009. These years of gains have gradually made investors more comfortable again, and now there appears to be a widespread consensus that it's finally "safe" to own stocks. I own stocks, so I'm certainly enjoying the advance. But unlike some other investors, I'm not feeling more comfortable as they move higher. Rather, I'm feeling less comfortable. Why? Because I do not think that time-tested market valuation measures have recently become out-moded and irrelevant. As I've described, these valuation measures suggest that today's stock prices have gotten so extreme that returns over the next decade are likely to be lousy (less than 2% per year, including dividends). So that's what I'm expecting long-term stock returns from these prices to be. Now, valuation is not helpful as a market-timing tool, so today's prices do not mean that stocks will crash anytime soon (or ever). Instead, stocks could deliver lousy returns just by moving sideways for a decade. But anyone who has followed the stock market for a while knows that stock prices do not generally correct valuation extremes by moving sideways. Rather, stocks generally correct sharply. That's why I've said I think the odds of a market crash are increasing. And I still think that — more so with every new move up. Even among investors who are as concerned as I am about long-term valuation measures, however, there is one consistent argument about why there won't be a crash: "There's no catalyst." Specifically, even cautious investors are concluding (or, at least, hoping) that, because they can't identify what will cause a crash, there won't be one. And maybe there won't be one. But I can promise you this: If there is no crash, it won't be because investors can't currently see any "catalyst." One of the biggest mistakes investors make when it comes to trying to time market turns is in thinking that there will be a clear "catalyst" or "sign" ahead of time that tells them when the market is about to turn. The truth is that there almost never is. There are plenty of catalysts and signs in hindsight, of course — when historians sift through the wreckage and, with the benefit of knowing how things turned out, list all the obvious factors that idiot investors ignored or missed. But, these catalysts and signs are almost never obvious at the time. (I speak from experience here, by the way. Towards the end of the dotcom bubble in the late 1990s, I was aggressively looking for a sign or "catalyst" that would tell me that it was finally time to lock in the extraordinary gains of the prior five years and head for the sidelines. And so were other investors who had a lot more experience than I did. But this sign, unfortunately, never came — until after the fact. After the fact, as always, it seemed screamingly obvious that the market was about to break down in the spring of 2000 and then, after a confidence-restoring headfake that summer and fall, erase several years of gains in a final, brutal two-year plunge. But most of the warning signs that were visible in 1999 and early 2000 had been visible for years, and that hadn't stopped the advance.) Today's stock market is nowhere near as overvalued as the one in 2000. And, thankfully, we have not yet reached a price at which long-term stock returns are likely to be negative. But even those who think that stocks have much farther to run should stop assuring themselves that the market won't crash because there's no visible "catalyst." Markets don't need a visible "catalyst" to crash. They just need a minor change in sentiment. Once stocks start going down, the enthusiasm for buying them at any price will rapidly cool. And the giddy investors who have recently piled up massive levels of margin debt to buy more stocks will rethink the wisdom of this. And the small investors who, finally, after five years of missed gains, have become comfortable enough to put money back into the market will suddenly start to focus on the downside again. And so on. One investor who has long been concerned about the risk of a crash is John Hussman of the Hussman Funds. This cautious stance, of course, has caused Mr. Hussman's funds to underperform badly over the last several years and, as a result, has led many of today's vocal bulls to dismiss him as a moron. You can view Mr. Hussman as a contrary indicator if you like (at your peril — he's one of the most disciplined analysts around), but at least listen to what he and others have to say about "catalysts": The immediate objection, of course, is that one does not observe an obvious “catalyst” that would warrant a market decline, much less a crash. As I wrote about our defensive stance during the 2000-2002 decline, “Our positions are always built on observable evidence rather than scenarios. We already have sufficient evidence to be fully defensive. Only later will we read in the headlines exactly why this defensive position was warranted.” As I noted again approaching the 2007 market peak, the need to wait for some observable “catalyst” to justify a defensive stance is reminiscent of other awful consequences of overvalued, overbought, overbullish, rising-yield syndromes, including the 1987 crash: “Investors could find no news to explain the crash in that instance, except an unusually large trade gap with Germany, so they continued to fear that particular piece of data. But day-to-day news events rarely ‘cause’ large market movements… Once certain extremes are clear in the data, the main cause of a market plunge is usually the inevitability of a market plunge. That's the reason we sometimes have to maintain defensive positions in the face of seemingly good short-term market behavior.” Sornette described this same regularity a decade ago: “The underlying cause of the crash will be found in the preceding months and years, in the progressively increasing build-up of market cooperativity, or effective interactions between investors, often translated into accelerating ascent of the market price. According to this “critical” point of view, the specific manner by which prices collapsed is not the most important problem: a crash occurs because the market has entered an unstable phase and any small disturbance or process may have triggered the instability. The collapse is fundamentally due to the unstable position; the instantaneous cause of the collapse is secondary. Essentially, anything would work once the system is ripe… a crash has fundamentally endogenous, or internal origin.” Again, I own stocks, so I certainly won't be unhappy if the market just keeps powering higher. But I only own stocks because I am comfortable with the idea that the market might drop 40%-60% over the next year or two. If the market does that, I will buy more stocks, just the way I did during the crash of 2008-2009. (I didn't buy enough stocks during this decline, unfortunately. Because, in part, I was stupidly waiting for a clear "sign" or "catalyst" for the upward turn.)  If you are not comfortable with the idea that stocks could drop 40%-60% over the next couple of years, you should think carefully about how you will feel and behave if they drop, say, 20%-30% (a garden-variety bear-market pullback). And if you conclude that a pullback like that would suddenly dampen your enthusiasm for owning stocks, you might think about re-balancing your portfolio now rather than then. Otherwise, you'll risk making the same mistake that far too many investors made in 2008 and 2009 — selling near the bottom. But, regardless, don't waste your time looking for a "catalyst." Chances are, you won't see one until it's too late. SEE ALSO: I Won't Be Surprised If The Stock Market Crashes Next Year — And You Shouldn't Be, Either
Asian equities mostly firmed, with the MSCI Asia-Pacific Index gained a little less than 0.5%, while the Dow Jones Stoxx 600 is little changed as its consolidates its gains to 6-year highs.Â  In the debt market, we note that the 10-year JGB yield has quietly crept up to new 3-month highs, while European bond yields are mostly softer. Â The US 10-year Treasury yield is hovering just below the 3% threshold.Â  The US economic calendar is light. Â Pending home sales and the Dallas Fed manufacturing report will be released. Â These rarely move the market, even in the best of times.Â  There are four developments to note:Â  1. Â France's Constitutional Court approved the government's revised effort to use tax policy to discourage high salaries. Â For this year and next, employers will pay 50% income tax on the portion of salaries over 1 mln euros (~$1.37 mln). Â Others taxes and levies will bring the effective tax rate to 75% (capped at 5% of the company's revenues). Â  Â Earlier this year, the Hollande government sought to apply the tax on individuals. Â The Court disallowed it on grounds that it was applied to individuals rather than households. Â This new iteration is payable by a company or organization. It is largely symbolic, though a costly symbol for artists and some athletes, who may be the most vulnerable. Â It is expected to raise a few hundred millions euros at most, but in terms of the government's budget is minuscule. Moreover, the tax is only for 2013 and 2014. Â It will generate a weak revenue stream and the temporary nature duration speaks to the lack of sustainability.Â  It is mostly thunder, with little rain. Â  Â Some observers play up the potential emigration by wealthy and successful people. Â  But this more an example of tax arbitrage. Â The emigration itself is a largely symbolic too as all that really changes is the taxing authority. Â There could be a high profile case or two, but this type of behavior appears to be very limited. Â  Â Integrating immigrants appears to be a more pressing issue that emigration.Â  Hollande claims his budget, which includes 15 bln euro spending cuts and new taxes will cut the country's deficit to 3.6% from an estimated 4.1% for this year. Â  Hollande may be able to influence the distribution of the pain and moderate the pace a bit, but cannot escape the ordo-liberal agenda (which Draghi himself has noted is embodied in the ECB). Â  The crux of the matter is straight forward. Â France has among the extensive role government and its services. Â The French tax burden is already 46% of GDP, which is among the highest among the OECD.  The Socialist Hollande, like UMP's Sarkozy before him, is Â embracing the ordo-liberal agenda reducing the budget deficit to 3% and, over time, balanced. Â  Â There are symbolic differences, but resistance to ordo-liberalism is not to be found in the main stream parties. Â Instead, one must turn to the far right. Â Le Pen's National Front, which appears poised to do well in the spring elections, defends the large role of the state, but thinks this is only possible outside of ordo-liberalism, which means, outside of the EMU. Â  The costs of exit could be minimized if, under French leadership, a bloc of other countries, including Spain and Italy, would leave in a coordinated fashion. 2. Â Many Italian economic officials in the government and central bank may miss New Year's celebrations as Italy's third largest bank, and the oldest bank in the world, Â may have to be nationalized. Â The key investor, a charitable banking foundation, with reportedly close ties with local politicians (and a 33.5% stake) has delayed the bank's proposal to dilute its stake through a new 3 bln euro equity offer in January 2014 (to after May 12).Â  Monte Paschi is required to pay back the 4.1 bln euros in state aid received earlier this year to avert nationalization. Â It is highly unusual for the Chairman and CEOs to be over ruled by the largest shareholder (who has veto power) and may resign over the dispute. Â A decision is expected next month. Â If the bank is nationalized, a new management team would likely be named.Â  It is possible that if a banking union was in place, Monte Paschi could face the immediate prospects of nationalization. Â However, the Italian government does not seem so inclined. Â In fact, it appears to be hoping that Monte Paschi can still raise the capital. Shares were limit down today (2%), though the overall stock market was posting small gain at midday. Â  As 2014 unfolds, many European banks, prompted by new capital requirements and the pending stress test, may also be trying to raise capital.Â Italy did sell 5- and 10-year debt today. Â The results were mixed, with the former rising and the latter slipping from the previous auctions. Â Thinness of market conditions contributed to the results. Â  3. Â Stepped up intervention and some reports of easing tension between the government and judiciary has seen the Turkish lira bounce back and equity recovery. Â The central bank indicated it would sell $600 mln today, the most since July, and will sell $3 bln in daily auctions in January. The lira rallied about 1.1% against the dollar at its best, before easing a bit. Â It is still up about 0.75% on the day. Â It has fallen by about 15% since the political crisis began on December 17. Â  The local equity market is up a little more than 3%, recouping about 1/5 of its recent losses. Â  Â  Yet, the debt market seems less sanguine. Â The (generic) 2-year yield is up 8 bp to 10.0%, which represents a new high and the 5-year credit default swap has also continued to rise. Â  4. China reported the results of its first audit of government debt in 2-years. Â The audit puts local government debt at CNY17.9 trillion (~$2.95 trillion) as of June. Â This represents a 2/3 increase from the last audit, though it includes CNY4.3 trillion of debt that is regarded as contingent, in the sense that local governments may not be legally obligated to cover. Â Â  The results had been expected in October and the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a government think tank, has estimated local government CNY19.9 trillion). Â  The government has already moved to curb the growth of local government debt, but dealing with the current stock of debt, in a slowing economy, will be an ongoing issue.Â  Read more posts on Marc to Market Â»

Scott Olson/Getty/AFPA shopper leaves a Crocs retail store on State Street in Chicago on July 23, 2009Crocs Inc said late Sunday that the Blackstone Group is making a $200 million (145 million euros ) investment that will give it preferred stock and a 13 percent stake in the US-based shoe company. The stock will have a six percent cash dividend rate, and at any time after three years from the issuance date, if the closing price of Crocs common stock equals or exceeds $29.00 for a period of 20 consecutive trading days, then the preferred stock shares will convert into shares of common stock, the statement read. The investment allows the private equity group to have two seats on the board of directors of the foam resin shoe company. Crocs shares closed Friday at $13.33 dollars on the Nasdaq, where it is traded. The leisure shoe company, founded in 1999 in Niwot, Colorado, is valued at $1.2 billion. Eighteen months ago Crocs's shares were trading at $22, but suffered from the company's weak performance. The Blackstone investment will allow Crocs to finance a $350 million stock repurchase program. Once complete, Crocs will have reduced its publicly traded common stock by 30 percent. "We expect these initiatives to reduce volatility in both our common stock price and our shareholder base and provide a strong foundation to unlock long-term value for our shareholders," said Crocs chief financial officer Jeff Lasher. For company CEO John McCarvel, who simultaneously announced his retirement in April, Blackstone's investment "is a vote of confidence in our company and our brand" despite mixed financial performance. Since its founding Crocs said it has grown into a company that employs 4,500 people and sells more than 55 million shoes a year in more than 90 countries. Â  Copyright (2013) AFP.

This week markets will probably be quiet again as many investors and traders will likely be preparing for and recovering from New Year's Eve festivities. However, there is a lot of economic data coming to kick off 2014. Here's your Monday Scouting Report: Top Story Economic Calendar Market Commentary One thing that has the market's bulls and bears split is the direction of corporate profit margins, which are near all-time highs. "Will profit margins contract?" asked Goldman Sachs' Jan Hatzius rhetorically. "No." "[T]he most important driver of profit margins is the gap between price inflation and unit labor cost inflation," said Hatzius. "When prices grow faster than unit labor costs, firms typically manage to raise their profit margins, and vice versa. In our view, the price/ULC gap is likely to move back into slightly positive territory in 2014. ...[T]he underlying trend calculated from the three primary measures of hourly wages—average hourly earnings, the employment cost index, and compensation per hour—is still only growing 2%. Going forward, we expect only a modest acceleration to perhaps 2.5%. Meanwhile, we expect productivity growth to reaccelerate to 1.5%-2%. Together, these numbers imply unit labor cost growth of 0.5%-1%, which would be slightly below the rate of price inflation of 1%-1.5%. "Of course, the price/ULC gap is not the only driver of margins. But other factors are also likely to look reasonably friendly. We expect foreign profits to improve in 2014 as the global economy gathers some momentum, and see no major changes in corporate income taxes or financial profits."
In this post I will hijack the questions intended for Jan Hatzius and answer them while pretending that my responses matter half as much as his do (see his answers here for comparison): 1. Will the economy accelerate to above-trend growth? No.  The US economy has historically grown at a rate of 6.7% NGDP since 1945.  The most recent economic crisis left the USA mired in an unusually deep hold where credit growth would not sustain higher aggregate demand and fiscal and monetary policy failed to bring the economy back to full strength.  Although the US economy has made tremendous progress in recent years and the private sector is improving, I think it is highly unlikely that the credit environment is strong enough to sustain high historical levels of growth. 2. Will consumer spending improve? Consumer spending is likely to continue stagnating.  The credit crisis left the household sector unusually vulnerable.  Although the consumer is much healthier than they have been, this remains an environment in which the consumer remains unusually fragile due to relatively weak balance sheets and a lack of demand for credit that results.  This means income expansion and hiring is likely to remain somewhat tepid, which, when combined with weaker than average demand for credit, will leave the consumer relatively weak. 3. Will capital expenditures rebound? Corporations are increasingly picking up the slack in the US economy and as has been historically true, as we enter the latter stages of the business cycle, capital expenditures are picking up.  Inventories are likely to continuing building in the coming year and modest capex expansion should continue, however, due to the fragile consumer, we must remain wary of this trend as corporations could easily be the catalyst of the next recession should they rein in spending at a time when it is most needed. 4. Will housing continue to recover? National housing prices have risen too far too fast in many areas of the USA and should see much more modest improvements in the coming years.  Many markets that have boomed in the last 12 months (such as San Francisco, San Diego and Phoenix) could be at risk of substantially lower year over year gains.  I do not foresee national declines, however. 5. Will labor force participation rate stabilize? The trend in the labor force participation rate is part structural and partially the result of the deep economic contraction from the crisis.  The improvement in the economy combined with the structural negatives do not leave me entirely optimistic that the labor force participation rate will see material improvement in 2014. 6. Will profit margins contract? Profits as a whole should continue modest single digit expansion in 2014, however, I would not expect the robust margin expansion of the last five years to continue.  The likely risk to profit growth and margins is to the downside, however, as of Q1 2014 I do not see substantial negative risk.  Rather, the more likely scenario is moderating margin expansion and modest single digit profit growth. 7. Will core inflation stay below the 2% target? At 1.7% core inflation does not have to climb much higher to hit the Fed’s target rate of 2%.  I would expect core inflation to remain low as consumer demand for shelter, autos and other core items remains tepid.  There is, in my opinion, very little chance of high inflation in 2014. 8. Will QE3 end in 2014? QE is likely to taper in increasing increments during 2014, but I do not think the Fed will pull the punch bowl away just yet.  We are more likely to see a slow and methodical approach to tapering.  Given the likelihood for another year of below historical levels of growth and low inflation, I think there’s a high probability we could still be talking about tapering 12 months from now. 9. Will the market point to the first rate hike in 2016? I am going to go way against the consensus here and argue that the next recession is likely to occur before the next rate hike.  ZIRP is here to stay and likely means QE is the policy variable of choice for the Fed in the coming few years.  Will a recession hit by 2016?  I am entirely unable to predict that far into the future, but I do think there’s a high probability that we will be in a recession before the Fed raises interest rates next. 10. Will the secular stagnation theme gain more adherents? The most hated economic recovery in the history of the USA is turning more and more people into bulls.  So no, I do not think the fear trade is winning.  In fact, I think the fragile economy combined with the potential for an overly bullish stock market could pose risks to the economy in the coming years.

Economist Branco Milanovic â€” a leading expert on global inequality â€” tweeted the effects of globalization in four sentences, from a new paper on the subject. They're really fascinating. @brankomilan For more on this topic, see his new paper on the subject.
Economist Branko Milanovic has been doing the most work lately on the subject of global inequality, and how it's changed in recent decades. Last night on Twitter he was offering up some nuggets from his recent paper: Global Income Distribution From the Fall of the Berlin Wall to the Great Recession. One chart he tweeted — which wasn't in the paper, but which he had the data for — was a comparison in per capita income between the poor in the US and the relatively upper class in China. Specifically, he compared the incomes of the 20th percentile in America (lower class people who make more than just 20% of other Americans) to the 80th percentile in China (upper class people who make more than 80% of Chinese). As of 2008, the American 20th percentile were still making considerably more than China's 80th percentile, but the gap closed massively in recent decades, as the US lower class has stagnated while China's upper-class has surged. @brankomilan In another tweet from his paper, he summarized the effects of globalization over the last couple of decades in just four sentences.

Susan Gary/ Getty ImagesWe're in the home stretch of the year, and markets are basically doing nothing, which is about what you'd expect. There was very little news over the weekend that could have been considered market-moving. Europe is flat. US futures are up a touch. Japan gained slightly and China was down a hair. Really not much at all. The Russian city of Volgograd has been hit by a second terrorist attack in as many days.
