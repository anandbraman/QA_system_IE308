ReutersChina has wrapped up its Economic Work Conference (EWC), an annual meeting in which policymakers assess the current state of the economy and set the tone for the next year's macroeconomic policy. The closed-door meeting highlighted six key tasks for Beijing in 2014. Policymakers made food safety their top priority. Cutting China's excess capacity was the second priority. Here are all six from Bank of America's Ting Lu: Ting sees two reasons that food security became the top priority for policymakers. First, 10% of food consumed in China in 2012, was imported and domestic food contamination worries continued to rise. Second, local governments taking advantage of the push for urbanization exacerbated land grabs. "Our understanding is that by emphasizing food security, the CPC will take a more cautious approach in drafting and implementing land reforms," writes Ting in a note to clients. The last two days of the conference were spent discussing the urbanization strategy, though not a lot was said on the subject in the EWC's communique.  No growth target was announced either, but this will most likely be revealed during the People's Congress in March.

That's a three month low. Full release Â» The consensus estimate was for 50.8, unchanged from the prior reading in November. That was already a two-month low. At 51.8, the output index hit a two-month low.Â  But new order growth hit a nine-month high. HSBC economist Hongbin Qu commented: â€œThe December HSBC Flash China Manufacturing PMI Â  reading slowed marginally from Novemberâ€™s final Â  reading. But it still stands above the average reading for Â  3Q, implying that the recovering trend of the Â manufacturing sector starting from July still holds up. As Â  a result, we expect China's GDP growth to stabilise at Â  around 7.8% yoy in 4Q.â€ Â  It's officially Flash PMI day, and we'll get readings for Europe and the U.S. too in the next 24 hours. Markets appear to be falling on the print. Hong Kong's Hang Seng was off 0.46% just prior to the survey's release, and is now down 0.56%.
The Japanese economy continues to be improving nicely.

REUTERS/Jonathan ErnstIn early November, Larry Summers gave a major speech at the IMF that outlined his fear that the United States could be entering a period of secular stagnation where the economy fails to create enough demand and bubbles are necessary to achieve full employment.Â In an article in theÂ Financial Times today, Summers expounded on that belief. He laid out four pieces of evidence for where his fear comes from: However, Summers is quick to point out that these four data points do not mean that we have entered a period of secular stagnation. They simply are reasons to be concerned. "Today, secular stagnation should be viewed as a contingency to be insured against â€“ not a fate to which we ought to be resigned," he writes.
Wong Campion/ReutersBEIJING (Reuters) - For all the hype, Apple Inc's long-awaitedÂ iPhoneÂ agreement withÂ China Mobile LtdÂ may deliver little more than a fleeting revenue jolt for the U.S. giant. A deal with the world's largest mobile carrier, expected as early as this week, nets Apple 759 million potential new customers that could generate $3 billion in 2014 revenue, or nearly one-quarter of Apple's projected revenue growth in its current fiscal year. But after the initial haul, Apple will find itself in a familiar, expensive battle with its mainÂ smartphoneÂ rival,Â South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, to win over customers, one wallet at a time. AndÂ ChinaÂ Mobile will likely have to wait at least a year for its payout as it spends billions of dollars to build a 4G network so customers can make full use of theiriPhones. "The easiest way to growÂ iPhoneÂ sales was always distribution. This was the pot at the end of the rainbow and now that we're there, it's going to be an old-fashioned slog it out over customers," saidÂ Ben Thompson, a Taipei-based writer on the technology industry at stratechery.com. ChinaÂ is Apple's second-largest market after theÂ United States. Net sales inÂ ChinaÂ for the fiscal year ended September 2013 rose 13 percent to $25.4 billion, accounting for about 15 percent of Apple's $170.9 billion in total net sales. But its performance has been mixed. Where once there were lines around the block for the newestÂ iPhone, now Apple faces intense competition from Samsung plus a host of local players such as Xiaomi making cheaperÂ smartphones. ChinaÂ Mobile, which says it already has 45 millionÂ iPhoneÂ users, could gain 17 million new activations and the deal should generate at least $3 billion in revenue for Apple in 2014, according to Forrester Research. Analysts expect Apple's revenue to increase by $13.2 billion in its fiscal year ending September 2014, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Apple declined to comment on its negotiations withÂ ChinaÂ Mobile.Â ChinaÂ Mobile spokeswomanÂ Rainie LeiÂ said talks were ongoing and declined to elaborate. AFTER THE GOLD RUSH The last of the big-name carrier signings marks a shift in theÂ smartphoneÂ battle: once availability is no longer an issue, marketing becomes the deciding factor. Samsung has the spending edge. The South Korean titan is expected to spend around $14 billion on advertising and marketing this year. Samsung spends a bigger chunk of its annual revenue on advertising and promotion than any of the world's top 20 companies by sales - 5.4 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. Apple spends just 0.6 percent. "Apple is definitely going to have to increase marketing spend," saidÂ Bryan Wang, a Beijing-based analyst with Forrester Research. "Apple is going to gain revenues fromÂ ChinaÂ through the upcomingÂ ChinaÂ Mobile agreement. But its next question will be how to further compete with competitors after the first year." Another problem for Apple is consumer habits inÂ China, whereÂ smartphoneÂ buyers tend to prefer cheaper handsets. More than 88 percent of people buyingÂ smartphonehandsets in the third quarter spent less than $500, according to data from Canalys. The latestÂ iPhoneÂ 5S costs $868 inÂ ChinaÂ while the 5C fetches $737, according to Apple'sÂ ChinaÂ website. To be sure, even winning over a tiny percentage ofÂ ChinaÂ Mobile's 759 million subscribers would be a boon for Apple. "The absolute number of people who are rich and can afford anÂ iPhoneÂ is quite large. It's a big deal," said stratechery.com's Thompson. ONE-TWO PUNCH ForÂ ChinaÂ Mobile, the payout will have to wait as it pumps billions of dollars into its 4G network roll-out andÂ iPhoneÂ subsidies eat into profit margins. It will take at least one year before anÂ iPhoneÂ deal is profitable for the carrier, according to Delta Partners, a global telecoms, media and technology advisory and investment firm based inÂ Dubai. Moody's Investors Service expectsÂ ChinaÂ Mobile's capital spending as a percentage of revenue will be about 30 percent in 2014, due to 4G spending. That works out to about 196 billion yuan ($32.28 billion), based on Thomson Reuters data on revenue forecasts from 29 analysts. ChinaÂ Mobile's existingÂ iPhoneÂ users can only use the company's slower 2G wireless speeds because its proprietary 3G TD-SCDMA standard is not compatible withiPhones. The company hopes the one-two punch of high-speed 4G mobile Internet and AppleiPhonesÂ will bring back customers who abandoned the carrier forÂ ChinaÂ Unicom Hong Kong Ltd andÂ ChinaÂ Telecom Corp, both of which already offer theÂ iPhone.ChinaÂ Mobile also hopes to get current subscribers to upgrade to premium product and service. One wild card is how the deal will be structured. In theÂ United States, Apple's home ground, wireless carriers subsidize theÂ iPhoneÂ in return for two-year contracts. These subsidies help make theÂ iPhoneÂ affordable to a wider U.S. customer base. Analysts estimate operators pay about $400 subsidy for eachÂ iPhoneÂ they sell, compared with about $250 to $300 for otherÂ smartphones. While carriers take an initial margin hit, they typically recover the subsidy cost over the two-year contract becauseÂ iPhoneÂ buyers typically tack on pricy data plans.
YouTube/hsdentfinancialHarry Dent lays out the ultimate bear case in his new book.Take one look at Harry Dent's body of work and you'll know he likes to make predictions. He wrote The Great Boom Ahead in 1993, The Great Jobs Ahead in 1995, The Great Depression Ahead in 2009, and The Great Crash Ahead in 2011. What's ahead now? A "demographic cliff," according to Dent's new book... Demographic Cliff: How to Survive and Prosper During the Great Deflation of 2014-2019. "At Dent Research we have a not-so-secret weapon: demographics," Dent writes. "It is the ultimate indicator that allows you to see around corners, to predict the most fundamental economic trends not just years but decades in advance." Dent spends the bulk of his book arguing that the demographic story has turned against the U.S. As Boomers retire, it's not an unfamiliar argument. Dent writes that an aging U.S. will cause deflation that will weaken the economy from 2014-2019. Here are some of his main points: "You need to prepare for that crisis, which will occur between 2014 and 2023, with the worst likely starting in 2014 and continuing off and on into late 2019," Dent concludes. "You can contribute to the solution by conserving your financial assets and reinvesting them after the crisis." Cheery stuff. You can get the book on Amazon.com.
Last night, Justin Wolfers Tweeted a chart from Visualizing Economics' Catherine Mulbrandon showing Lorenz curves â€” distribution breakdowns â€” by income source: labor, capital, business and capital gains. It reveals how different parts of the population get their income way differently than others â€” but that the rich enjoy a minimum 50% share of each source of income, and practically the entire share of one category. Here's the breakdown: First, labor income, defined as wages, salaries, employer-paid health insurance premiums and employer payments to entitlement programs : Next up is business and capital, which have about the same curve shape.Â Business income is net income from owner-operated businesses and farms, partnership income, and income from S corporations. Capital income, excluding capital gains,Â comprises taxable and tax-exempt interest,Â dividends paid by corporations (but not dividends from S corporations, which areÂ considered part of business income), positive rental income, and corporate incomeÂ taxes. Finally, for capital gains, or profits from the sales of assets that have increased in value: Here's the chart: Visualizing EconomicsWhat's even scarier is that this data is from 2007 CBO data. The Great Recession is likely to have made these curves even steeper.Â  We are living in a highly unequal society.
APUgh. Paul Ryan says there will be a debt ceiling fight. From POLITICO: House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said on â€œFox News Sundayâ€ Senate and House Republicans will soon huddle at their party retreats to figure out what Republicans can extract out of Democrats in return for raising the debt ceiling next year. â€œWe as a caucus -- along with our Senate counterparts -- are going to meet and discuss what it is weâ€™re going to want out of the debt limit,â€ Ryan said. â€œWe donâ€™t want nothing out of this debt limit. Weâ€™re going to decide what it is weâ€™re going to accomplish out of this debt limit fight.â€ Last week the House passed a two-year budget agreement (which will probably be passed by the Senate this week) and there was talk about how maybe there was a bit of a thaw in Washington as Boehner used the opportunity to talk smack about the outside right-wing pressure groups. But road bumps remain.

Business InsiderThe top 50% of earners make almost all of the money.One of the most challenging and important issues in the U.S. right now is the rise of income inequality. The country's highest earners are taking home a bigger percentage of the national income than ever before. This trend is hurting the economy — because the middle class consumers who spend most of the money in the economy don't have much money to spend.  And middle-class folks are understandably frustrated about that. At the same time, in part because of this rising income disparity, the country's highest earners are paying the lion's share of the nation's income taxes. The highest earners are understandably frustrated about that. It's easy to hear all the talk about inequality and taxes without being able to visualize this. So, last year, BI's Eric Platt and I put together some charts to illustrate it.
Falling prices sound like a good thing, but they're not. When prices fall, people put off buying things. And when people put off buying things, companies put off investing. And then the economy slumps—and keeps slumping. Even worse, people are stuck trying to pay back debts that don't fall with wages that do. So bankruptcies pile up, and so do bank losses. That makes people too scared to borrow, and banks too scared to lend, which only makes prices fall even more. This self-perpetuating cycle of doom is what sunk the global economy in the 1930s, and what, to a lesser extent, has sunk Japan since the 1990s. And it's what has been sinking us since 2008, though this time central banks have at least kept prices from falling, just barely.  Now, it doesn't make much sense, but there's actually a currency designed to create these kind of economic calamities. A currency designed for deflation. That's Bitcoin, the virtual currency you can theoretically use to buy things online. See, there's a predetermined number of bitcoins that will only grow at a low rate until 2040—and then stop. This artificial scarcity means that the dollar value of a bitcoin should go up considerably. And it has. In just the last year, it's gone up something like 64 times. That's enough that "Bitcoin millionaires" are now a thing. Of course, a stronger Bitcoin is just another way of saying that things cost less in terms of Bitcoin. In other words, there's Bitcoin deflation. Just how much? Well, as you can see below, Peter Coy calculates that prices would have had to fall 98.5 percent the past year if they had been set in terms of Bitcoin. As point of comparison, prices fell about 10 percent a year during the worst of the Great Depression. Via The Atlantic But prices aren't set in terms of Bitcoin. They're set in terms of dollars. So it doesn't hurt the real economy when the price of Bitcoin goes up. People just go on living their lives, mostly unaware of the virtual currency. But it does hurt the Bitcoin economy, such as it is, when the price of Bitcoin goes up. Why would anyone use their bitcoins to buy things when those bitcoins might double in value in a day—or hour—or two? They wouldn't. Researchers found that 64 percent of bitcoins are in accounts that have never been used. And the ones that are being used aren't being used more. You can see that in the chart below from Jason Kuznicki, which looks at the dollar value of all bitcoin transactions each day divided by the dollar value of all bitcoins each day. It's hard to see any pattern here—and that's the point. If people were using bitcoins more, this ratio would be going up. It's not.   Via The Atlantic Bitcoin won't work as a currency as long as it's so deflationary. Why spend bitcoins today when they might be worth much more tomorrow? The only reason would be to buy or do things online that you can't buy or do with dollars (or euros or yuan)—something illegal. Now, black markets can be big markets, especially when it comes to evading capital controls, but not so big that Bitcoin would ever become more than a niche "currency." What Bitcoin really needs is a central bank to stabilize its value. When the demand for Bitcoin goes up, they need to print more to keep it from skyrocketing. That is, they need to decide whether they want Bitcoin to be a Ponzi scheme for techno-libertarians or an actual medium of exchange. See, the technology of Bitcoin really is revolutionary, and the currency of Bitcoin is holding it back. In other words, Bitcoin really could have use as a payments system if it had a stable value. But it doesn't, so it's just a dotcom stock. And one that could be co-opted by banks that take its technology and use it with dollars instead. So who's the perfect person to run Bitcoin? It'd have to be someone with central banking experience. Someone who understands why deflation is a problem. And someone who thinks virtual currencies hold promise. Someone like ... Ben Bernanke.
In 2008, the aftermath of the Subprime Mortgage Crisis created theÂ perfect storm for the emergence of Bitcoin. Here is the definitive history of the famous crypto-currency. From the pseudonymous "Satoshi Nakamoto's" founding to the innovation of block chains to the "genesis block", buying pizzas, sandwiches, Teslas, and now houses...Â Bitcoin has come a long wayÂ (and where it goes is anyone's guess)...

REUTERS/Jason LeeNorth Korean leader Kim Jong-un (R) salutes as a honour guard march past as he and Premier Pak Pong-ju attend the opening ceremony of the Cemetery of Fallen Fighters of the Korean People's Army (KPA) in Pyongyang July 25, 2013, as part of celebrations ahead of the 60th anniversary of the signing of a truce in the 1950-1953 Korean War.PYONGYANG, North Korea (AP) — A senior North Korean official said Sunday that the execution of leader Kim Jong Un's once-powerful uncle will not lead to changes in economic policies and vowed that the nation would push ahead with an ambitious plan to develop new economic zones to attract foreign investment. Jang Song Thaek's wife, meanwhile, has been named to an ad-hoc state committee, the country's official media reported, an indication that Jang's execution has not immediately diminished her influence. The execution Friday of Jang, considered to be North Korea's second most powerful man and a key architect of the country's economic policies, should not be taken as a sign that the North will change its economic course or its efforts to lure foreign investment, Yun Yong Sok, a senior official in the State Economic Development Committee, said in an interview with The Associated Press in Pyongyang. Luring foreign investment is critical to garnering badly needed foreign currency and funding for infrastructure projects so the Kim regime can live up to its promise of raising the impoverished nation's standard of living. "Even though Jang Song Thaek's group caused great harm to our economy, there will be no change at all in the economic policy of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea," Yun said. "It's just the same as before." Jang's sudden purge and execution for allegedly trying to overthrow the government has raised questions about how solid the North Korean regime is and whether it will be able to stay the course on policies aimed at raising the country's standard of living. Last month, North Korea announced plans to create in each province special economic zones, which are like incubators for introducing capitalist methods into the North's tightly controlled, command economy. The North also recently laid out new laws to facilitate foreign tourism and investment. The laws provide foreign investors with special incentives and guarantees, while giving local leaders greater autonomy to promote themselves and handle business decisions. But even before Jang's execution, it was unclear how far Pyongyang was willing to go. The North has shown no willingness to abandon its nuclear weapons program to get out from under international trade sanctions. That makes investment or financing from major international organizations difficult if not impossible. It also means the success of the zones hinges on China, North Korea's only major ally, and Jang was seen as a crucial conduit between Pyongyang and Beijing, along with being a supporter of China-backed reforms, such as the zones, to revive the North's moribund economy. Jang met with top Chinese officials during their visits to Pyongyang, and in 2012 traveled to China as the head of one of the largest North Korean delegations ever to visit the Chinese capital to discuss construction of the special economic zones, which Beijing hopes will ensure North Korea's stability. Yun, however, downplayed Jang's importance in policymaking and said his removal would instead speed progress on the economic front because he was a threat to the unity of the nation. He said Jang's execution should not scare away Chinese investment, which is crucial to the success of the zones. "By eliminating the Jang Song Thaek group, the unity and solidarity of our party and people with our respected marshal at the center has become much stronger, our party has become more determined and the will of our soldiers and people to build a prosperous socialist country has been strengthened," Yun said. "Our State Economic Development Committee welcomes investment and business from any country to take part in the work of developing our new economic zones." Yun said local officials have been tasked with drawing up the plans for the zones in their jurisdictions and are likely to formally submit them for approval to his commission within the next few months. Jang was considered the second most powerful man in North Korea before his fall, which was announced last week and followed days later by his execution for a long list of anti-state crimes, including building a power base of his own to rival and possibly overthrow Kim and the ruling Workers' Party. His removal leaves no clear No. 2 under Kim, whose inner circle now includes Vice Marshal Choe Ryong Hae, Premier Pak Pong Ju and the ceremonial head of state, Kim Yong Nam. What will happen next in Pyongyang remains unclear, but North Korea watchers will be closely following the second anniversary of Kim Jong Il's death on Tuesday for clues. Of particular interest is whether Jang's wife, Kim Kyong Hui, the younger sister of Kim Jong Il, will be present in official ceremonies. Her name appeared in a state media dispatch late Saturday alongside top officials on a funeral committee for fellow senior Workers' Party official Kim Kuk Thae, who died Friday. Kim Kyong Hui, 67, has risen through the ranks in recent years and holds a slew of top posts. Analysts said the dispatch suggested that her political standing hasn't been immediately affected by her husband's execution and that she may have even given her nephew the green light to fire Jang — but not to have him executed. "She may have opposed Jang's death sentence, but she could have agreed on Jang being dismissed," said analyst Hong Hyun-ik from the private Sejong Institute in South Korea. Kim and Jang, who married in 1972, had a dysfunctional marriage in recent years, and their only daughter committed suicide in 2006 while studying in Paris, according to South Korean media reports. Hong said that if her health condition allows it, Kim Kyong Hui is expected to join other top officials at Tuesday's ceremonies marking the second anniversary of Kim Jong Il's death. Kim Kyong Hui's public activities have been sharply reduced in recent months amid media reports that she suffers liver, heart and other ailments. ___ Associated Press writer Hyung-jin Kim in Seoul, South Korea, contributed to this report.

REUTERS/Marco DjurcaPro-European integration protesters stand on a statue with Ukrainian flags during a rally in Independence Square in Kiev December 15, 2013.BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union said on Sunday it was suspending further work with Ukraine on an ambitious trade and cooperation agreement because the government in Kiev had failed to give a clear commitment to signing the deal. EU enlargement chief Stefan Fuele said on Twitter that the words and deeds of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich and his government on the proposed trade pact with the EU were "further and further apart. Their arguments have no grounds in reality." Fuele said he had told Ukraine's first deputy prime minister Serhiy Arbuzov in Brussels last Thursday that further discussion on the trade agreement was conditional on a clear commitment by Kiev to sign it, but he had received no response. As a result, work on the agreement was "on hold", he said. Kiev had been expected to sign the agreement at a summit last month, but Yanukovich turned his back on the accord at the last minute in favor of closer ties with Moscow, leading to mass protests in Kiev. The EU kept its offer on the table and Arbuzov said in Brussels last Thursday that Ukraine would sign the pact soon, but Brussels disputes Kiev's assertions that it needs 20 billion euros ($27 billion) of EU aid to offset the cost of adapting to the agreement.
