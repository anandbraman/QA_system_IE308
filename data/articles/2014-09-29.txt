Thomson ReutersAn employee works at a machine manufacturing factory in HuaibeiBEIJING (Reuters) - Activity in China's vast factory sector showed signs of steadying in September as export orders climbed, a private survey showed on Tuesday, easing fears of a hard landing but still pointing to a sluggish economy. The final HSBC/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index(PMI) hovered at 50.2 in September, unchanged from the August reading which was a three-month low, but lower than a preliminary reading of 50.5. A sub-index measuring new export orders, a gauge of external demand, expanded to a 4-1/2-year-high of 54.5. But the survey also pointed to further weakness in the job market, as the sub-index for manufacturing employment shrank for the 11th consecutive month, which is bound to concern China's Communist leaders. The world's second-largest economy has stumbled this year as a slowdown in the housing market further weighed on softening domestic demand. Economists believe policymakers will have to roll out more stimulus measures in coming months to meet the government's 2014 growth target of around 7.5 percent.

REUTERS/Jim Young Bill Gross.Shock and disbelief lingered at Pimco's sleek Newport Beach, California, headquarters on Monday, 72 hours after the investment firm was rocked by the sudden defection of cofounder Bill Gross to the far-smaller rival Janus Capital Group. As executives worked at damage control and to promote the new faces behind investment decision-making at the $2 trillion asset manager, some employees were struggling to cope with the tsunami that swamped their world on Friday. "I couldn't believe it on Friday, and I still can't believe it now," one employee who was not authorized to speak publicly told Reuters. "We lost Mohamed El-Erian in January and now Bill Gross. It's been confusing, frantic and sad." The stunning turn of events kept Pimco executives working over the weekend and throughout Monday to soothe clients and staff rattled by the episode, which triggered flashbacks of the departure of El-Erian, once seen as Gross' heir-apparent. Pimco CEO Doug Hodge and Group CIO Dan Ivascyn convened a series of conference calls with clients and the media to field questions about the firm's future and respond to concerns about how they and corporate parent German insurer Allianz had handled the affair. After US markets closed Monday, Hodge and Ivascyn were joined by President Jay Jacobs and global credit chief Mark Kiesel for a global staff meeting and video conference with all employees to boost morale, according to a source close to the situation. A Pimco spokesperson confirmed that Hodge, Ivascyn, Jacobs, and Kiesel spoke to all employees and added "that the mood in the firm is energized and focused." Among the efforts at containing the fallout was a 90-minute conversation with a Morningstar analyst Eric Jacobson, who has been a supporter of Gross and the firm's flagship Total Return Fund PTTRX.O, the world's largest bond fund that Gross steered personally for more than a quarter century. Jacobson would not disclose the substance of the conversation. On Friday he had placed his ratings under review for the flagship fund and all others he had rated. Since the start of the year, investors have pulled $25 billion from the Pimco Total Return Fund and more than $65 billion over the past 16 months. Hodge told Reuters on Sunday that Pimco was bracing for more investors to pull money: "The outflows that have happened — and that may happen — we stand by our clients. We are managing assets and are confident that the vast majority of clients will stand with us." Meanwhile, the firm worked to scrub out Gross' cyber footprints, as well. Pimco's Twitter feed deleted all tweets from Gross, who had once been a prolific tweeter. His widely followed monthly Investment Outlook pieces, considered a must-read by investment professionals worldwide, were tucked out of sight as well, now residing in an archive section of the Pimco website. Still, some signs of his long association with Pimco remain. Each of Pimco's highly prized Morningstar awards — including those honoring Gross — are mounted in the same place at the entrance to the firm's trading floor.   (Reporting By Jennifer Ablan; Editing by Dan Burns and John Pickering) FREE AppDownload
Credit Karma, a credit-tracking personal finance site, raised $75 million on Monday in a new round of funding that values the company at more than $1 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported. The new funding, coming just six months after its $85 million Series C, was led by Google Capital, Tiger Global Management, and Susquehanna Growth Equity. The 7-year-old company now has raised over $193 million. Credit Karma calls itself the “Expedia for financial services products.” Its users get free credit reports, and based on that score, receive financial product offers, like credit cards or mortgages, that would fit their needs. It also provides financial tools and advice to help its users better understand their own finances.  The site currently has 32 million users, and is growing at a healthy clip, adding 1.5 million new users every month, according to Bloomberg. It doesn’t charge its users, however, and instead takes a portion of any deal made between financial institutions and its members. Credit Karma’s CEO Ken Lin said in March that it’s making more than $200 million a year, according to Quartz. It’s unclear if it’s profitable yet, but he said at the time that “the outfit wavers between profitability and break-even status.”  Credit Karma is the 15th US tech company to get a valuation over $1 billion this year, Bloomberg says. It’s also part of a growing number of financial tech startups attracting massive VC money, like Lending Club, which has raised over $392 million to date, and SoFi, which had more than $566 million in venture capital funding so far.

As pro-democracy protests continue to erupt in Hong Kong, take a look at how the island has transformed over the last century. This photo of Hong Kong's harbor was taken between 1910 and 1915, from what is now known as Victoria's Peak, while the island was under British colonial rule. The island started out as a fishing village, and later became a center of trade before exploding into a commercial and financial center. Library of Congress/Flickr The photo below, from 1972, shows the same view from Victoria's Peak to the center of Hong Kong and across the harbor to Kowloon. After a brief occupation by the Japanese during World War II, Britain regained control of the island. The highrise buildings in central Hong Kong housed hotels, banks, and businesses. CC/Flickr The photo below was taken in 2014, and shows modern day Hong Kong, one of the busiest, most cosmopolitan urban centers on the planet. The island was returned to China in 1997, and is currently in the midst of a massive protest over what residents see as an attempt from Beijing to limit democracy by placing restrictions on who can run for the island's top office.  Tutti Frutti on Shutterstock FREE AppDownload
Steve Jennings/Getty Images for TechCrunchTheranos chairman, CEO, and founder Elizabeth Holmes at TechCrunch Disrupt at Pier 48 on Sept. 8 in San Francisco. No more wondering to yourself, "Ah, how much more can they take before I pass out?" Instead you might be able to walk into a Walgreens pharmacy for a reportedly painless fingerprick that will draw just a tiny drop of blood, thanks to Elizabeth Holmes, 30, the youngest woman and third-youngest billionaire on Forbes' newly released annual ranking of the 400 richest Americans. Revolutionizing the blood test is a golden idea. Because of new testing methods developed by Holmes' startup Theranos, that lone drop can now yield a ton of information. The company can run hundreds of tests on a drop of blood far more quickly than could be done with whole vials in the past — and it costs a lot less. Holmes dropped out of Stanford at 19 to found what would become Theranos after deciding that her tuition money could be better put to use by transforming healthcare. Traditional blood testing is shockingly difficult and expensive for a tool that's used so frequently. It also hasn't changed since the 1960s. It's done in hospitals and doctors' offices. Vials of blood have to be sent out and tested, which can take weeks using traditional methods and is prone to human error. And, of course, sticking a needle in someone's arm scares some people enough that they avoid getting blood drawn, even when it could reveal lifesaving information. Holmes recognized that process was ripe for disruption. It took a decade for her idea to be ready for primetime, but now it seems that her decision to drop out was undoubtedly a good call. Last year, Walgreen Co. announced that it would be installing Theranos Wellness Centers in pharmacies across the country, with locations already up and running in Phoenix and Palo Alto, California. And Holmes has raised $400 million in venture capital for Theranos, which is now valued at $9 billion (Holmes owns 50%). The other two 30-year-olds on Forbes' List, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his former roommate and Facebook CEO Dustin Moskovitz, also have access to a wealth of information about people — but their data is less likely to directly save a life. Courtesy Theranos One closely guarded secret is what MedCityNews calls "the most interesting part of [the Theranos] story": how exactly the technology behind its blood test works. The company's methods are protected by more than a dozen patents filed as far back as 2004 and as recently as last week. In an interview with Wired, Holmes hinted at some of the key ideas behind Theranos. "We had to develop ... methodologies that would make it possible to accelerate results," she said. "In the case of a virus or bacteria, traditionally tested using a culture, we measure the DNA of the pathogen instead so we can report results much faster." While we can't yet assess independently how well that method works when compared with traditional blood tests, it already seems to be upending the old way of doing things. Holmes told Medscape that she targeted lab medicine because it drives about 80% of clinical decisions made by doctors. By zeroing in on the inefficiencies of that system, the Theranos approach completely revolutionizes it. The new tests can be done without going to the doctor, which saves both money and time. Most results are available in about four hours, which means that you could swing by a pharmacy and have a test done the day before a doctor's visit, and then the results would be available for the physician. Quick tests that can be done at any time are already a total change, but the amount of data the company can get from a single drop of blood is amazing. Blood samples have traditionally been used for one test, but if a follow-up was needed, another sample had to be drawn and sent out — making it less likely that someone would get care. The Theranos approach means the same drop can be used for dozens of different tests. It's cheap, too. One common criticism of the healthcare system is that the pricing structure is a confusing labyrinth that makes it impossible to know how much anything costs. Theranos lists its prices online, and they're impressive. Each test costs less than 50% of standard Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates. If those two programs were to perform all tests at those prices, they'd save $202 billion over the next decade, Holmes said in an interview on Wired. Plus, people get access to their own results. As an example of how helpful that can be, Holmes told Wired that Theranos charges $35 for a fertility test, which is usually paid for out-of-pocket and costs up to $2,000. But she also said that this data could be useful for anyone looking to gain a better understanding of his or her health. "By testing, you can start to understand your body, understand yourself, change your diet, change your lifestyle, and begin to change your life," she said.    FREE AppDownload
Dreamworks/"Shrek"Talks between Japan's SoftBank and DreamWorks Animation have reportedly cooled down, according to The Wall Street Journal. An earlier report said that the deal would provide SoftBank "another route to try to fulfill [its] ambition of challenging America's top two wireless carriers, AT&amp;T and Verizon." SoftBank owns around 80% of Sprint, and earlier this year was looking to merge Sprint and T-Mobile, before it abandoned that deal.  It wasn't clear what happened between when the talks started over the weekend and when they cooled down on Monday, the WSJ reported, but talks could restart in the future.  DreamWorks Animation has produced films including "Shrek," "Madagascar," and "How To Train Your Dragon."  FREE AppDownload

On Monday, Ford warned that its international results would disappoint. In an investor presentation, Ford said it sees taking a $1.2 billion pre-tax loss in Europe during 2014 due to lower industry volume and deteriorating business conditions in Russia.  In 2015, Ford expects to continue losing money in Europe — to the expected tune of $250 million — when the company had previously expected to become profitable in that market next year.  But Ford also had a troubling warning for its South America business. The company expects to take a pre-tax loss of about $1 billion 2014, but Ford on Monday became one of the first major companies citing weaker currencies as having a big impact on financial results.  Recently, the US dollar has been on a tear, and a stronger dollar is likely to impact the results of companies that do lots of business internationally.  In a recent note to clients, analysts at Barclays said companies with high international exposure have already begun to experience relative weakness.  Barclays said estimates haven't quite adjusted to reflect the dollar's strength, the market has begun to act, and this trend is likely to continue as third quarter results start rolling in.  Barclays FREE AppDownload

The user contacted Trump early Monday asking him to retweet a photo of his parents, whom he claimed had been inspired by Trump throughout their lives.  Twitter He later tweeted, "Some jerk fraudulently tweeted that his parents said I was a big inspiration to them + pls RT-out of kindness I retweeted. Maybe I'll sue." Trump has been involved in several lawsuits, having sued a book author, a Miss USA contestant, a comedian, and various global financial institutions including Deutsche Bank and Fortress Investment Group in the past decade alone, as The Atlantic has reported.  Just this year, Trump filed a lawsuit seeking the removal of his name from two Atlantic City Casinos, stating that the Trump Plaza and the Trump Taj Mahal had fallen into "disrepair, tarnishing his personal brand and confusing customers."  Whether or not Trump will actually take legal action against the prankster remains unclear. The billionaire expressed his disappointment again later on Monday, tweeting that, "I guess this teaches you not to be nice or trusting. Sad!"    FREE AppDownload

Investors Lose More Money Trying To Anticipate Corrections, Than From Corrections Themselves (Charles Schwab)  The economy has seen a 'secular' bull market since 2009, and the recent pause has caused some investors to fear a major pullback. There may be a correction in the market soon, although the long-term trend is still upwards, according to Charles Schwab analysts. "Geopolitical tensions, some measures of stretched sentiment, weakening market breadth, Fed tightening on the horizon, and midterm election risk" could all be factors in an upcoming pullback. However, even though there is an anticipated market pullback, investors should not try and time the market. Charles Schwab cites a Peter Lynch quote: "Far more money has been lost by investors preparing for corrections, or trying to anticipate corrections, than has been lost in corrections themselves." Schwab conducted a study using S&amp;P data that showed that between 1994-2013, "missing the top ten up days by trying to time the market would have resulted in a reduction of 9.2% annualized return to 5.5%." In other words, investors lose more money trying to anticipate corrections, than from the corrections themselves. Real Estate And Commodities Performed The Best When Inflation Is Low, While Cash Did The Worst (Financial Planning) Real estate and commodities performed best after periods of low inflation over the past 15 years, according to Craig L. Israelsen. An investment of $10,000 in real estate grew to $35,030 and in commodities grew to $32,141, as measured by the Vanguard REIT ETF and PowerShares DB Commodity Tracking ETF, respectively. Cash was one of the only asset classes that produced a net loss after 15 years. The ending balance was under $10,000 after inflation. However, this is unsurprising as cash is cushion that protects investors from major market losses, and now a "growth engine." "Cash is like a seat belt — vitally important when needed, but annoying the rest of the time. Nevertheless, we wear the seatbelt all the time, and we likewise keep a prudent portion of the portfolio in cash," Israelsen adds. There Are Several Ways To Recruit Young Advisors (Investment News) Advisory firms need to add young advisors to their firms, and there are several ways to attract young talent. Firms can "build relationships with local college professors, use nationwide recruiting services, scan association job boards or grow the talent in-house," according to Liz Skinner. And the most successful firms "present a clear route to advancement," which is important for young advisors who are looking to grow their careers. Another major recruiting tool is offering paid internships that don't require grunt work, according to Ben Franklin, the managing director of Franklin Wealth Advisors Inc. This "apprenticeship program" helps cultivate talent. That way, students can learn the skills needed to be an advisor. The recruiting service "Advisors Ahead" created a similar recruiting service for graduates. Financial advisory firms can pay Advisors Ahead to hire young professionals, then Advisors Ahead trains the young graduates and helps them get licenses. Eventually, the advisory firms hire these trained young professionals full-time once they are well-trained. A Firm Was Ordered To Pay $3.9 Million After A Messy Brokerage Firm Case (The Wall Street Journal) Investors accused the CEO and president of the Resource Horizons Group LLC brokerage firm of "negligence in the hiring and supervision of Robert Gist, a former broker for the firm who has been accused by regulators of misusing $5.4 million of client money," according to The Wall Street Journal's Anna Prior. According to the SEC, Gist took the clients' money and spent it on himself. Gist then funneled other money into a company, Encap Technologies LLC, in which he had an ownership stake. He's since been barred from the brokerage industry. The investors sought $5.8 million, including $3.5 million in out of pocket losses even though Gist is no longer at the firm. An arbitration panel awarded them $3.7 million.  This Year Own Longer-Maturity Bonds And Sell Shorter Maturities (The BlackRock Blog) "We do love bonds in 2014, but that love is conditional," writes BlackRock's Jeffrey Rosenberg. He expects a 50-basis point increase in the 10-year Treasury this year, and therefore suggests that "owning longer-maturity bonds while selling shorter maturities could be a winning combination in the year ahead." "Related to our first theme, we think the most vulnerable area of the bond market is the two-to-five year maturity range. Longer-maturity bonds look more attractive than they used to given the rise in rates we saw last year and the Fed should keep rates on the ultra-short end of the curve static. It's that area in the middle that looks dicey. This means that investors should underweight short-duration strategies as well as bank loans," Rosenberg writes. And finally, since interest rates have been climbing and credit spreads have been narrowing, certain credit sectors are "starting to look more vulnerable," Rosenberg writes. For the time being, BlackRock still likes the high yield sector given that liquidity is high and defaults are low. FREE AppDownload
The Waltons are the richest family in America. The descendants of Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton, the family controls more than 50% of the Wal-Mart Corporation, according to Bloomberg, and combined are worth at least $160 billion based on Forbes' wealth estimates. Four Walton family members are in the top 10 of the latest Forbes 400 list of the richest Americans. They have spent some of their money amassing huge collections of art, real estate, and expensive cars. They also invest a portion of their fortune into charity, mainly through the Walton Family Foundation. But unlike some of today's millionaires who plan to donate most of their vast wealth to charity, the Waltons have used tax loopholes to keep getting richer. Despite backlash, lawsuits, and even the occasional scandal, Wal-Mart's first family isn't going anywhere — especially when 90% of Americans live within 15 miles of one of the gigantic chain's stores.

FordFord closed down almost 7.5% on Monday.  The bloodletting was swift: the company basically fell off a cliff at about 3 p.m. The stock closed at $15, after ending Friday at $16. Concerns about Ford's losses in Europe and South America drove the selloff. Bloomberg reported that Ford expects to lose a combined $2.2 billion in both markets this year. It was a rough day for Ford's new CEO, Mark Fields, who took over at the Blue Oval in July.Screenshot via Yahoo FinanceFord took a dive in the markets.The damage in Europe can largely be chalked up to problems in Russia, where auto sales are on the decline, according to the Detroit Free Press. Automakers have been looking to Russia for growth, to make up for troubled overall European operations. But the plans of Ford and others have been upended by the ongoing crisis in Ukraine, which has led to economic sanctions against Russia.APSanctions against Russia have hurt car sales there.The magnitude of Ford's predicted losses in Europe are eye-catching. In the second quarter, Ford reported a slight profit in Europe, after failing to make any money there since 2011. The European situation hasn't exactly been good, but investors on Monday were taken aback by how feeble the prospects for improvement are. The impending losses were announced at a Ford investor conference, along with the news that Ford will reduce the total number of so-called "platforms" on which it builds its vehicles to 9 from 15.  That's a significant reduction for an automaker that offers vehicles in a wide variety of segments, from compact cars to full-size pickup trucks. But Ford has been executing this reduction for several years, as part of the "One Ford" strategy that former CEO Alan Mulally introduced when he took the helm at the company before the financial crisis.Sakchai Lalit/APFormer Ford CEO Alan Mulally.On Monday, the company also announced a recall of 850,000 vehicles for an electrical issue that could affect airbags. The recall could cost the automaker $500 million in 2014, the Detroit News reported. Ford, General Motors, and upstart electric carmaker Tesla have all been trading lower in the second half of September. Tesla is still up massively from its 2010 IPO price, but GM and Ford have been struggling, even as new car sales in the U.S. have surged to heights not seen since the boom years before the Great Recession.

REUTERS/Marcos BrindicciArgentina's President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner talks to Economy Minister Axel Kicillof (L) during a ceremony at Buenos Aires' Stock Exchange, August 20, 2014. On Monday Judge Thomas Griesa found Argentina in contempt of a U.S. Court ruling — the Judge will decide on how to punish the nation later. A few ideas have been thrown around, though. One option is that the country be fined $50,000 a day until it pays a group of hedge fund creditors, helmed by billionaire investor Paul Singer, over $1.3 billion. The hedge fund creditors suggested that punishment last week.  This is all part of a lawsuit that's been going on for around a decade. The creditors in question bought Argentine sovereign debt during the country's last crash in 2001. Unlike a bunch of other investors, though, they refused to take a haircut on that debt in 2005 and 2010. Argentina saw that refusal as a slight, called the creditors "vultures" and refused to pay them. The ensuing court battle went all the way to The Supreme Court, ending in victory for the creditors this summer. Still, Argentina would not pay. As a result, the country went into default at the end of July.   The contempt ruling doesn't just come from non-payment though. After Argentina went into default its leaders went on a media rampage claiming that no such default had occurred. They even took out ads in U.S. papers like the New York Times.  Then the country passed a law effectively nullifying Judge Griesa's ruling, and taking the bonds in question out of U.S. jurisdiction. The message was clear, if you want your money, you have to go to Argentina to get it. Which means if you want your money, you'll only get it only if Argentina wants to give it to you. On Friday the country's rhetoric softened slightly. Presidential Cabinet head Jorge Capitanich said it would only negotiate with creditors in the first quarter of 2015 if a stay is put on all payment, effectively taking  the country out of default. At Monday's hearing, Argentina argued that finding it in contempt would harm “the dignity of foreign states” — basically saying contempt is too embarrassing for a single nation. What is certain is that Argentina can't do this forever. Its economy is suffering from high inflation and low commodities export prices. Barclays estimates that by this time next year, the country could have about $10 billion in the bank. Barclays So maybe even that $50,000 a day will be a headache for Argentina. FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Bobby Yip A student provides supplies on a tram track as thousands of students occupy a main street at Causeway Bay shopping district in Hong Kong September 29, 2014.Stocks fell on Monday after opening sharply lower following a turbulent week and protests in Hong Kong that broke out over the weekend and pressured Asian stocks overnight. First, the scoreboard: And now, the top stories on Monday: 1. The latest report on personal income and outlays showed that "core" personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, which is the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation and excludes the more volatile prices of food and gas, rose 0.1% month-over-month. On a year-over-year basis, "core" PCE rose 1.5%. Personal spending rose 0.5% in August and personal income rose 0.3%. Following the report, Ian Shepherdson at Pantheon Macro said, "In one line: Autos drive August spending up, but Q3 will look pedestrian... Assuming no revisions, that implies Q3 consumption will rise by only 1.6% annualized, down from 2.5% in Q2." 2. Pending home sales in August fell more than expected, falling 1% against expectations for pending home sales to fall 0.5%. On a year-over-year basis, pending home sales fell 4.1% in August. Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors, said of the report: "Fewer distressed homes at bargain prices and the acknowledgment we’re entering a rising interest rate environment likely caused hesitation among investors last month. With investors pulling back, the market is shifting more towards traditional and first-time buyers who rely on mortgages to purchase a home." 3. The Dallas Fed's latest manufacturing report beat expectations, coming in at 10.8 against estimates for a 10.5 reading, and the report said, "Perceptions of broader business conditions were more optimistic this month." 4. Stocks opened lower on Monday and clawed back most of those gains, but on Monday Business Insider's Joe Weisenthal noted a few reasons why the sell-off might be different this time. Short-term Treasury yields have been increasing steadily this year, and Dan Greenhaus of BTIG wrote that the speed at which market sentiment shifted from bullishness to bearishness could find this character of this market changing in ways some investors may not expect.  5. Greenlight Capital's David Einhorn is the largest shareholder of Einstein Noah Restaurant group, which agreed to be acquired for $20.25 per share in deal worth about $374 million. All told, it was a pretty good day for Einhorn. 6. GoPro shares were on a tear again on Monday, gaining more than 11% and bringing the share price above $90 for the first time. It's been about three months since the wearable camera company went public at $24 per share, and Business Insider's Henry Blodget did some quick math to show GoPro investors what kind of revenue and profit performance the company might need to justify its current stock price.  7. Over the last year or so, the idea of "secular stagnation," that the world economy is facing a new limit on potential future growth has become popular among economists after Larry Summers first discussed the idea at the IMF last year. On Monday, Deutsche Bank's Torsten Slok circulated an email that said with economic headwinds fading and expectations for economic growth of more than 3% over the next six quarters, secular stagnation is over. 8. The Russian ruble, as well as the Russian stock market, have been getting crushed as the Russian economy starts to really feel the pain of Western sanctions. On Monday, the ruble fell to about 39.4 against the US dollar, its worst level in more than 10 years.  Don't Miss: Brazil Is Getting Annihilated » FREE AppDownload

Justin Sullivan/GettyMistakes you make with your checking account now cost more than ever.They may not be on par with death and taxes, but rising ATM fees seemingly have become a fact of life. Average ATM surcharges and out-of-network ATM fees surged to new highs this year, according to the 17th annual Bankrate Checking Survey. The jump in ATM fees was a standout in the 2014 survey, which also saw record highs for overdraft fees and for some account maintenance fees. Look up interest rates on high yield savings accounts "ATM fees, overdraft fees, year in year out, the fees go up," says Greg McBride, CFA, Bankrate's chief financial analyst. But Bankrate's survey also offered some positives. Namely, checking fees that had been moving higher appear to be stalling. The same goes with the free fall in the number of free checking accounts. And consumers should remember: With a little planning ahead, there's no reason to ever fork over hard-earned cash for fees. Bankrate surveyed the 10 largest banks and thrifts in 25 of the nation's biggest markets from July 10 to Aug. 6, 2014. Bankrate Fall 2014 Checking Survey The average surcharge that banks charge non-customers who use their ATMs climbed 6.5% to $2.77, marking the 10th year in a row of increases for this fee. The average fee banks charge their own customers for going to an outside ATM also rose to a new high of $1.58. That means that, combined, consumers pay an average of $4.35 each time they use an out-of-network ATM. That's an increase of more than 5% from last year. "The ATM fees go up at such a rapid clip because it's really low-hanging fruit as far as fee income is concerned," McBride says, noting that the surcharge is a non-customer charge. McBride says ATM surcharges may even persuade a non-customer to open an account at the bank of an ATM they regularly use. "If a non-customer is always using a bank's ATM and getting dinged with the fee, they may just throw in the towel and become a customer of the bank." Mark Schwanhausser, director of Omnichannel Financial Services at Javelin Strategy &amp; Research, says ATM fees are the price for not planning ahead to get to an in-network ATM or for choosing a bank that does not have convenient ATMs. "If you're going to use someone else's ATM, they have a right to charge you for it," Schwanhausser says. "Is the fee appropriate? That's where you start to have a debate." Both he and McBride say using apps or websites to find nearby ATMs, or using a debit card at a store and getting cash back, can help consumers avoid ATM fees. "Routinely incurring ATM fees is a sloppy financial habit, but it's one that can be fixed," McBride says. "You can plug the hole in the bucket just by limiting withdrawals to your own bank's ATMs." Bankrate.com Fall 2014 Checking Survey The dreaded and much-maligned overdraft fee, also known as nonsufficient funds fee, is on the rise again this year, Bankrate found. But the rise of 1.7% (to an average of $32.74) was less than the rate of inflation. "A lot of things ... in life go up," McBride says, adding that overdraft fees have been rising at a rate consistent with inflation for the past few years. "Laundry detergent goes up, but no one complains about it." Part of the reason overdraft fees get so much attention is they can drain consumers' accounts more quickly than ATM surcharges or other fees. Consumer vitriol against overdraft and other fees has, in part, led to fewer fees online or with mobile banking sites like GoBank, Simple, or Moven, says Jim Johannes, director of the Puelicher Center for Banking Education at the University of Wisconsin. One easy way to avoid overdraft fees: Don't opt in to overdraft protection. That means debit card purchases that would overdraw an account would simply be declined. Opting out won't protect against overdrafts, but it can help to avoid fees. Consumers also should monitor their account balances and transactions. "Maintaining higher balances … reduces the need for overdraft protection," says Paul Gregg, who teaches personal finance and investments at the University of Central Florida. And with mobile apps and online banking, an account balance is never more than a click away. Bankrate.com Fall 2014 Checking Survey Unlike noninterest checking accounts, which saw the average balance requirements and monthly service fees fall from last year, the average fees for interest accounts actually rose in this year's survey. The average account balance required to avoid a fee increased 7% to $6,211, while monthly fees for customers who don't meet requirements nudged up 0.8% to a new high of $14.76. That makes interest checking accounts an even less attractive product, given that the average yield on such accounts hit a new low of 0.4%. "Why bother?" McBride asks. "Interest accounts are not worth the hassle … The fees are higher, the balance required is higher. If you've got to strand a large amount of money in a (low-yield account) just to avoid a fee, it's time to make a change." Although rising fees can boost the cost of checking accounts, the vast majority of checking accounts are still free, although sometimes with an asterisk. Bankrate's latest survey found that 38% of noninterest checking accounts are free, with no monthly maintenance fees or other requirements. That's the same as last year and down only slightly from 39% in 2012. Only 4% of interest checking accounts are free. However, 97% of the accounts surveyed can be free if a consumer meets certain conditions. In other words, the majority of checking accounts waive monthly fees if a consumer keeps a certain minimum balance, uses direct deposit or e-statements, or meets some other requirement. "Having a direct deposit is … a convenience for the customer, but it's also something that makes it more difficult for you to disentangle from the bank," Schwanhausser says. The rising fees found in the Bankrate survey may, in part, be a move to recoup banks' overall revenue losses. Changes in government regulations and changes in consumer behavior have reduced revenue from these fees. A study by Pulse shows that ATM withdrawals per month per active card have been dwindling. That means fewer opportunities for out-of-network ATM fees. Meanwhile, fewer consumers are overdrafting their accounts, in part because of a 2010 Federal Reserve rule prohibiting banks from charging overdraft protection fees unless a consumer opts in. Review savings account rates These and other changes have put a crimp on banks' noninterest revenue, causing some banks to raise overdraft and other fees in recent years. Data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. show that the fees collected by U.S. commercial banks peaked in 2009 and have been falling since then, dropping more than 20% from $41.1 billion in 2009 to $32.5 billion in 2013. Still, McBride says he doesn't expect to see any dramatic spikes in average fees in the future to offset lost revenue. "The sharp decline in free checking and the run-up in fees as the result of regulatory changes has run its course," he says. FREE AppDownload
Shares of McDonald's have spiked in afternoon trade.  Shares of the fast food giant were up as much as 2.5% in afternoon trade, but quickly surged those highs within the last half hour, an unusual move for a company so large and stock that is so liquid. Some on Twitter are speculating that activist investor Carl Icahn has taken a stake in the company, but this is isolated and completely unconfirmed. On Twitter, Mike Bergen at Bergen Capital tweeted the cryptic: Are you lovin' it @Carl_C_Icahn ? $MCD Meanwhile Eric Hunsader of Nanex, LLC has also noted Monday's action in McDonald's, writing on Twitter that only 20% of volume in the stock today has taken place on "lit" exchanges with 80% of trades taking place in dark pools.  Only 20% of $MCD volume today is on lit exchanges.

This is the way the world ends This is the way the world ends This is the way the world ends Not with a bang but a whimper. –  T. S. Eliot, “The Hollow Men” What we may be witnessing is not just the end of the Cold War, or the passing of a particular period of postwar history, but the end of history as such: that is, the end point of mankind’s ideological evolution and the universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government. This is not to say that there will no longer be events to fill the pages of Foreign Affairs' yearly summaries of international relations, for the victory of liberalism has occurred primarily in the realm of ideas or consciousness and is as yet incomplete in the real or material world. But there are powerful reasons for believing that it is the ideal that will govern the material world in the long run. – Francis Fukuyama, The End of History and the Last Man Francis Fukuyama created all sorts of controversy when he declared “the end of history” in 1989 (and again in 1992 in the book cited above). That book won general applause, and unlike many other academics he has gone on to produce similarly thoughtful work. A review of his latest book, Political Order and Political Decay: From the Industrial Revolution to the Globalisation of Democracy, appeared just yesterday in The Economist. It’s the second volume in a two-volume tour de force on “political order.” I was struck by the closing paragraphs of the review: Mr. Fukuyama argues that the political institutions that allowed the United States to become a successful modern democracy are beginning to decay. The division of powers has always created a potential for gridlock. But two big changes have turned potential into reality: political parties are polarised along ideological lines and powerful interest groups exercise a veto over policies they dislike. America has degenerated into a “vetocracy”. It is almost incapable of addressing many of its serious problems, from illegal immigration to stagnating living standards; it may even be degenerating into what Mr. Fukuyama calls a “neopatrimonial” society in which dynasties control blocks of votes and political insiders trade power for favours. Mr. Fukuyama’s central message in this long book is as depressing as the central message in “The End of History” was inspiring. Slowly at first but then with gathering momentum political decay can take away the great advantages that political order has delivered: a stable, prosperous and harmonious society. While I am somewhat more hopeful than Professor Fukuyama is about the future of our political process (I see the rise of a refreshing new kind of libertarianism, especially among our youth, in both conservative and liberal circles, as a potential game changer), I am concerned about what I think will be the increasing impotence of monetary policy in a world where the political class has not wisely used the time that monetary policy has bought them to correct the problems of debt and market-restricting policies. They have avoided making the difficult political decisions that would set the stage for the next few decades of powerful growth. So while the title of this letter, “The End of Monetary Policy,” is purposely provocative, the longer and more appropriate title would be “The End of Effective and Productive Monetary Policy.” My concern is not that we will move into an era of no monetary policy, but that monetary policy will become increasingly ineffective, so that we will have to solve our social and physical problems in a much less friendly economic environment. In today’s Thoughts from the Frontline, let’s explore the limits of monetary policy and think about the evolution and then the endgame of economic history. Not the end of monetary policy per se, but its emasculation. The End of Monetary Policy Asset classes all over the developed world have responded positively to lower interest rates and successive rounds of quantitative easing from the major central banks. To the current generation it all seems so easy. All we have to do is ensure permanently low rates and a continual supply of new money, and everything works like a charm. Stock and real estate prices go up; new private equity and credit deals abound; and corporations get loans at low rates with ridiculously easy terms. Subprime borrowers have access to credit for a cornucopia of products. What was Paul Volcker really thinking by raising interest rates and punishing the economy with two successive recessions? Why didn’t he just print money and drop rates even further? Oh wait, he was dealing with the highest inflation our country had seen in the last century, and the problem is that his predecessor had been printing money, keeping rates too low, and allowing inflation to run out of control. Kind of like what we have now, except we’re missing the inflation. Let’s Look at the Numbers The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has a marvelous website full of all sorts of useful information. Let’s start by looking at inflation around the world. This table is rather dense and is offered only to give you a taste of what’s available.  What we find out is that inflation is strikingly, almost shockingly, low. It certainly seems so to those of us who came of age in the ’60s and ’70s and who now, in the fullness of time, are watching aghast as stupendous amounts of various currencies are fabricated out of thin air. Seriously, if I had suggested to you back in 2007 that central bank balance sheets would expand by $7-8 trillion in the next half-decade but that inflation would be averaging less than 2%, you would have laughed in my face. Let’s take a quick world tour. France has inflation of 0.5%; Italy’s is -0.2% (as in deflation); the euro area on the whole has 0.4% inflation; the United Kingdom (which still includes Scotland) is at an amazingly low 1.5% for the latest month, down from 4.5% in 2011; China with its huge debt bubble has 2.2% inflation; Mexico, which has been synonymous with high inflation for decades, is only running in the 4% range. And so on. Looking at the list of the major economies of the world, including the BRICS and other large emerging markets, there is not one country with double-digit inflation (with the exception of Argentina, and Argentina is always an exception – their data lies, too, because inflation is 3-4 times what they publish.) Even India, at least since Rajan assumed control of the Reserve Bank of India, has watched its inflation rate steadily drop. Japan is the anomaly. The imposition of Abenomics has seemingly engineered an inflation rate of 3.4%, finally overcoming deflation. Or has it? What you find is that inflation magically appeared in March of this year when a 3% hike in the consumption tax was introduced. When government decrees that prices will go up 3%, then voilà, like magic, you get 3% inflation. Take out the 3% tax, and inflation is running about 1% in the midst of one of the most massive monetary expansions ever seen. And there is reason to suspect that a considerable part of that 1% is actually due to the ongoing currency devaluation. The yen closed just shy of 110 yesterday, up from less than 80 two years ago. I should also point out that, one year from now, this 3% inflation may disappear into yesteryear’s statistics. The new tax will already be factored into all current and future prices, and inflation will go back to its normal low levels in Japan. Inflation in the US is running less than 2% (latest month is 1.7%) as the Fed pulls the plug on QE. As I’ve been writing for … my gods, has it really been two decades?! – the overall trend is deflationary for a host of reasons. That trend will change someday, but it will be with us for a while. Where’s my GDP? Gross domestic product around the developed world ranges anywhere from subdued to anemic to outright recessionary:  The G-20 itself is growing at an almost respectable 3%, but when you look at the developed world’s portion of that statistic, the picture gets much worse. The European Union grew at 0.1% last year and is barely on target to beat that this year. The euro area is flat to down. The United Kingdom and the United States are at 1.7% and 2.2% respectively. Japan is in recession. France is literally at 0% for the year and is likely to enter recession by the end of the year. Italy remains mired in recession. Powerhouse Germany was in recession during the second quarter. Let’s put those stats in context. We have seen the most massive monetary stimulation of the last 200 years in the developed world, and growth can be best described as faltering. Without the totally serendipitous shale oil revolution in the United States, growth here would be about 1%, or not much ahead of where Europe is today. Demographics, Debt, Bond Bubbles, and Currency Wars Look at the rest of the economic ecology. Demographics are decidedly deflationary. Every country in the developed world is getting older, and with each year there are fewer people in the working cohort to support those in retirement. Government debt is massive and rising in almost every country. In Japan and many countries of Europe it is approaching true bubble status. Anybody who thinks the current corporate junk bond market is sustainable is smoking funny-smelling cigarettes. (The song from my youth “Don’t Bogart That Joint” pops to mind. But I digrass.) We are seeing the beginnings of an outright global currency war that I expect to ensue in earnest in 2015. My co-author Jonathan Tepper and I outlined in both Endgame and Code Red what we still believe to be the future. The Japanese are clearly in the process of weakening their currency. This is just the beginning. The yen is going to be weakening 10 to 15% a year for a very long time. I truly expect to see the yen at 200 to the dollar somewhere near the end of the decade. ECB head Mario Draghi is committed to weakening the euro. The reigning economic philosophy has it that weakening your currency will boost exports and thus growth. And Europe desperately needs growth. Absent QE4 from the Fed, the euro is going to continue to weaken against the dollar. Emerging-market countries will be alarmed at the increasing strength of the dollar and other developed world currencies against their currencies and will try to fight back by weakening their own money. This is what Greg Weldon described back in 2001 as the Competitive Devaluation Raceway, which back then described the competition among emerging markets to maintain the devaluation of their currencies against the dollar. Today, with Europe and Japan gunning their engines, which have considerable horsepower left, it is a very competitive race indeed – and one with far-reaching political implications for each country. As I have written in past letters, it is now every central banker for him- or herself. That Pesky Budget Thing Developed governments around the world are running deficits. France will be close to a 4% deficit this year, with no improvement in sight. Germany is running a small deficit. Japan has a mind-boggling 8% deficit, which they keep talking about dealing with, but nothing ever actually happens. How is this possible with a debt of 250% of GDP? Any European country with such a debt structure would be in a state of collapse. The US is at 5.8% and the United Kingdom at 5.3%, while Spain is still at 5.5%. Let’s focus on the US. Everyone knows that the US has an entitlement-driven spending problem, but very few people I talk with understand the true nature of the situation, which is actually quite dire, looming up ahead of us. In less than 10 years, at current debt projection growth rates, the third-largest expenditure of the United States government will be interest expense. The other three largest categories are all entitlement programs. Discretionary spending, whether for defense or anything else, is becoming an ever-smaller part of the budget. Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid now command nearly two-thirds of the national budget and rising. Ironically, polls suggest that 80% of Americans are concerned about the rising deficit and debt, but 69% oppose Medicare cutbacks, and 78% oppose Medicaid cutbacks.  At some point in the middle of the next decade, entitlement spending plus interest payments will be more than the total revenue of the government. The deficit that we are currently experiencing will explode. The following chart is what will happen if nothing changes. But this chart also cannot happen, because the bond market and the economy will simply implode before it does.  A Multitude of Sins Monetary policy has been able to mask a multitude of our government’s fiscal sins. My worry for the economy is what will happen when Band-Aid monetary policy can no longer forestall the hemorrhaging of the US economy. Long before we get to 2024 we will have a crisis. In past years, I have expected the problems to come to a head sooner rather than later, but I have come to realize that the US economy can absorb a great deal of punishment. But it cannot absorb the outcomes depicted in those last two charts. Something will have to give. And these projections assume there will be no recession within the next 10 years. How likely is that? What happens when the US has to deal with its imbalances at the same time Europe and Japan must deal with theirs? These problems are not resolvable by monetary policy. Right now the markets move on every utterance from Janet Yellen, Mario Draghi, and their central bank friends. Central banking dominates the economic narrative. But what happens to the power of central banks to move markets when the fiscal imperative overcomes the central bank narrative? Sometime this decade (which at my age seems to be passing mind-numbingly quickly) we are going to face a situation where monetary policy no longer works. Optimistically speaking, interest rates may be in the 2% range by the end of 2016, assuming the Fed starts to raise rates the middle of next year and raises by 25 basis points per meeting. If we were to enter a recession with rates already low, what would dropping rates to the zero bound again really do? What kind of confidence would that tactic actually inspire? And gods forbid we find ourselves in a recession or a period of slow growth prior to that time. Will the Fed under Janet Yellen raise interest rates if growth sputters at less than 2%? An even scarier scenario is what will happen if we don’t deal with our fiscal issues. You can’t solve a yawning deficit with monetary policy. Further, at some point the velocity of money is going to reverse, and monetary policy will have to be far more restrained. The only reason, and I mean only, that we’ve been able to get away with such a massively easy monetary policy is that the velocity of money has been dropping consistently for the last 10 years. The velocity of money is at its lowest level since the end of World War II, but it is altogether possible that it will slow further to Great Depression levels. When the velocity of money begins to once again rise – and in the fullness of time it always does – we are going to face the nemesis of inflation. Monetary policy during periods of inflation is far more constrained. Quantitative easing will not be the order of the day. For Keynesians, we are in the Golden Age of Monetary Policy. It can’t get any better than this: free money and low rates and no consequences (at least no consequences that can be seen by the public). This will end, as it always does… Not with a Bang but a Whimper Will we see the end of monetary policy? No, policy will just be constrained. The current era of easy monetary policy will not end (in the words of T.S. Eliot) with a bang but a whimper. Janet or Mario will walk to the podium and say the same words they do today, and the markets will not respond. Central banks will lose control of the narrative, and we will have to figure out what to do in a world where profits and productivity are once again more important than quantitative easing and monetary policy. You need to be thinking about how you will react and how you want to protect your portfolios in such a circumstance. Even if that volatility is years off, “war-gaming” how you will respond is an important exercise. Because it will happen, unless Congress and the White House decide to resolve the fiscal crisis before it happens. Calculate the odds on that happening and then decide whether you need to have a plan. Unless you think the bond market will continue to finance the US government through endless deficits (as so far has happened in Japan), then you need to start to contemplate the end of effective monetary policy. I would note that, even in Japan, monetary policy has not been effective in restarting an economy. It is a quirk of Japan’s social structure that the Japanese have devoted almost their entire net savings to government bonds. As the savings rate there is getting ready to turn negative, we are going to see a very different economic result. Japan with the yen at 200 and an even older society will look a great deal different than the country does today. Current market levels of volatility and complacency should be seen as temporary. Plan accordingly. Washington DC, Chicago, Athens (Texas), and Boston I am in Washington DC as you read this. I have a few meetings set up, as well as a speaking engagement, and then I’ll return home to meet with my business partners at Mauldin Economics later in the week. In the middle of October I will go to Chicago for a speech, fly back to a meeting with Kyle Bass and his friends at the Barefoot Ranch in Athens, Texas, and then fly out to Boston to spend the weekend with Niall Ferguson and some of his friends. I am sure I will be happily surfing mental stimulus overload that week. Next weekend (October 4) is my 65th birthday. I had originally thought I would do a rather low-key event with family; but my staff, family, and friends have different plans. I’m not really supposed to know what’s going on and don’t really have much of an idea as I am not allowed around planning sessions, but it sounds like fun. I am walking on legs that feel like Jell-O, as it was “legs day” yesterday, working out with The Beast. My regular workout partner couldn’t make it, so he was able to focus on exhausting me to the maximum extent possible. I’ve never been all that athletic. As a kid, for the most part I was not allowed to participate in PE due to some physical limitations (which fortunately went away as I grew older). I became a true geek. Not that that is all bad: it has served me rather well later in life. Geeks rule. It wasn’t until I was in my mid-40s that I began to go to the gym on more than a haphazard basis. And I must confess that I was a typical male in that I focused on my upper body as opposed to my legs and abdominals. That oversight is catching up with me now. The Beast is forcing me to devote more time to my legs and core. Much better for me as I approach the latter half of my 60s, but it’s painful to realize the cost of my negligence. In the last five or six years my travel has reduced my gym time, or at least that’s my excuse. For whatever reason, my travel has been reduced for the last two months, so I’m getting much more time in the gym, and my workouts are more well-rounded. I typically try to do at least another 30 minutes of cardio after our training sessions, even if the session was based around cardio. Except on leg days. There’s nothing left for extra walking or cycling after leg days. I share this because I want you to understand that working out is just as important as your investment strategy. I fully intend to be going strong for a very long time. But that doesn’t happen (at least as easily) if you lose your legs. As much as I hate leg days, I probably need those workouts more than any others. It’s time to hit the send button. I hear kids and grandkids gathering in the next room. That’s something else that is just as important as investment strategy. You have a great week.

VocativKenny Lissak, former SAC traderFormer SAC Capital trader/founding partner Kenny Lissak shared a sad, cautionary tale with Vocativ about how his addiction to painkillers destroyed his life. Lissak, who was filmed at his now-empty waterfront mansion, admitted to spending an obscene amount of money for drugs.  "I would give doctors big checks — twenty-five, fifty, hundred thousand dollar checks for their supposed research, which they weren't doing — it was just to get more prescriptions," he said.  Lissak said toward the end he would pay around $10,000 per week just to get someone to pick up pills for him.  He became addicted after undergoing back surgery. His addiction included Oxycontin, Percocet, Adderall, and Cocaine. "If I didn't have Oxycontin every two hours, I would be in withdrawal — major withdrawal." He went to rehab seven times before finally getting clean. He's been sober for several years.   VocativLissak says that the house he and his wife built is for sale. Since then, his wife has left him. He doesn't get to see his four kids as much as he would like.  "Now being here, you know, the house is for sale because we are getting a divorce. We are basically liquidating. I guess we are liquidating our life. The hardest part for me is that I destroyed it myself."  During his Wall Street career, Lissak worked at Kadem Capital and Amtech Capital in New York. He's currently a trading performance coach, his bio on Essentia Analytics website shows.  Check out the Vocativ clip:   FREE AppDownload

REUTERS/Eduardo MunozFollowing Bill Gross' unexpected departure from PIMCO, Wall Street appointed Jeffrey Gundlach as the new Bond King. But apparently not everyone agrees. The superstar bond manager Gundlach and the mutual-fund rating service, Morningstar, are feuding, according to a Barron's report. Back in July, Morningstar classified Gundlach's $35 billion bond fund, DoubleLine Total Return, as "not ratable." Which is a strange decision, considering the fact that DoubleLine outperformed every other bond fund in its category since its debut in April 2010. Morningstar's Sarah Bush said the the fund was reclassified because Gundlach severed all communication with the rating firm's analysts back in the summer of 2012. Additionally, Morningstar expressed concern "that the fund's periodic resort to what Morningstar termed variously as esoteric or exotic mortgage securities, such as inverse floaters and interest-only strips, gave Total Return a high risk hue," according to Barron's. DoubleLine responded "heatedly" by saying that it cut off communication with Morningstar's analysts because the rating firm made "falsehoods and mischaracterizations" about it. These "falsehoods and mischaracterizations" go back all the way to 2009. Back then, when Gundlach was fired at the TCW, 'Morningstar's Eric Jacobson "came out with a lengthy report gushing over TCW's 'savvy move' in agreeing at the same time to buy the LA bond manager Metropolitan West Asset Management to take over Gundlach's duties." That same year after Gundlach was already voted Morningstar's Bond Manager of the Year, the rating firm engineered a re-vote — crowning Daniel Fuss of Loomis Sayles instead. The Gundlach-Morningstar feud doesn't seem to be ending any time soon, but that hasn't stopped DoubleLine or Gundlach. After all, bad ratings can only go so far when the firm is continuously posting great numbers. After legendary bond investor Bill Gross left his firm, PIMCO, last week, $400 to $500 million poured into DoubleLine. Quite a vote of confidence.

Justin Sullivan/GettyMark Zuckerberg's fortune climbed $15 billion in the last year.The 2014 Forbes 400, an annual ranking of the 400 wealthiest Americans, launched Monday. One thing's certain: The rich keep getting richer. Mark Zuckerberg, the 30-year-old cofounder and CEO of Facebook, became the 11th richest person in the U.S., with a net worth of $34 billion. The Zuck also scored the title of "biggest gainer" in 2014, pocketing an additional $15 billion since last year. His placement atop this list continues a winning streak of sorts for the CEO, whose net worth has more than tripled over the past two years, according to Forbes' Katia Savchuk. His soaring fortune is in part thanks to Facebook's recovery from its disappointing IPO in 2012. Shares of the $200 billion company have seen a sharp rise in the last year, and in the second quarter of this year. Yahoo! FinanceA two-year look at Facebook's share price shows that the social network has been on a tear in the last year.

Its market cap is now larger than Amazon's and Yahoo's combined. The behemoths of tech were all winners this year. The top 10 earners working in the tech industry are collectively 23% richer than last year.

Alexei Nikolskyi/RIA Novosti/Kremlin Russia's President Vladimir Putin.  Western sanctions against Russia are starting to hit home. The Russian ruble and Russian stock market have both been falling in recent weeks as sanctions weigh on the Russian economy.  As of Monday, one dollar bought about 39.4 rubles, and according to Bloomberg's Vladimir Kuznetsov, the Russian central bank is close to stepping in. Kuznetsov reported that, "The ruble fell 0.8 percent to 44.2450 versus the central bank’s target basket of dollars and euros... That’s within 0.4 percent of the 44.40 threshold that would prompt the monetary authority to begin buying rubles according to its policy guidelines." The ruble has already been the world's worst performing currency this quarter, Kuznetsov reported, while the US dollar has been on a tear. Russia's response to sanctions hasn't really helped so far, as food prices started skyrocketing earlier this month after it banned imports from the West in retaliation. And just this weekend, we learned that the sanctions will likely prevent Exxon and Russian state-owned oil company Rosneft from working together on a huge Arctic oil project.  Here's a chart that shows the ruble's decline in the last three months against the dollar.

We recently looked at how much a household would need to earn to be in the top 1% of the income distribution in each state. Now, we found that cutoff for the 20 largest US cities. We used data from the Minnesota Population Center's IPUMS, a modified (for statistical and privacy reasons) version of the individual responses to the Census Bureau's 2012 American Community Survey. From that data, we estimated the annual household income (rounded to the nearest thousand dollars) needed to be in the top 1% in the 20 largest Metropolitan Statistical Areas: Business Insider/Andy Kiersz, data from Minnesota Population Center 2012 ACS IPUMS As one might expect, the cutoffs for the top 1% are higher in the big coastal cities than in other parts of the country. To be in the top 1% in New York, Boston, Washington, and San Francisco, you'll need to be pulling in more than half a million dollars per year. As we noted in our discussion of the states, these should be taken as very rough estimates. Survey data often has trouble capturing the full picture of very high earners.  To see whether you're in the top or bottom half of your city, and to compare to the top 1%, here's the median income for each of the 20 metro areas, again rounded to the nearest thousand: Business Insider/Andy Kiersz, data from 2012 American Community Survey Estimates

Inflation is high and wages are rising, but corporate margins are low, and difficult reforms are necessary. Morgan Stanley sees the country's GDP going negative in the first half of 2015, contracting -0.4%. Rousseff's regime has been plagued with allegations of corruption and mismanagement. Petrobras itself is a perfect example. A former Petrobras employee named dozens of politicians who have taken kickbacks from the company under Rousseff's watch. "A few years ago I said this was the best run oil company in Latin America," economist Claudio Loser, cofounder of Centennial Group Latin America, told Business Insider earlier this month, "but it has collapsed under the political pressure of the government. They're wasting a great opportunity in the way they're managing their oil resources. I'm not saying 'as goes Petrobras there goes Brazil,' but it is very, very important." That is why Wall Street wants someone else in charge.  However, it looks as if that change may not come — not from the top at least. The latest polls put Dilma Rousseff ahead of her most serious contender, environmental activist/politician Marina Silva, from 1% to 4%. In early September, some polls put Silva up by as much as 10%. And change isn't necessarily change in this scenario. Yes, Silva is a Green candidate, but she comes from the "same place" as Rousseff, Loser told Business Insider. Cantor Fitzgerald put it this way in a recent note: "It does not take much sense of history to appreciate the irony that Ms. Silva is running a reform campaign against a leftist Workers Party candidate, who herself came in under a reform agenda president (Lula). Moreover, Ms. Silva was herself a Workers Party minister from 2003 to 2008 under Lula." And more to this point, Silva's former running mate — the politician Eduardo Campos, who died in a plane crash this summer — was included on that list of Petrobras names.  So what's change, really?

AP ImagesJack Ma, founder of Alibaba and onetime KFC reject. Forbes released its annual Forbes 400 list on Monday, revealing the 400 wealthiest people in the US. It's not just a list of privilege; it's a story of opportunity. Many of these mega successes started with limited means.  Just ask Jan Koum, the WhatsApp founder who once lived on food stamps. After selling his company to Facebook in February for $19 billion, he's now worth $7.7 billion, Forbes estimates. Then there's Larry Ellison, who worked eight years of odd jobs before founding Oracle. He's one of the biggest dollar gainers since last year, making a $9 billion jump in net worth from 2013.  It's not only an American Dream. Several international entrepreneurs have had similarly meteoric rises. Talk to Alibaba founder Jack Ma, who started his career as an English teacher and is now worth over $20 billion after taking his company public.  These rags-to-riches stories remind us that through determination, grit, and a bit of luck anyone can overcome their circumstances and achieve extraordinary success.

Business InsiderNEW YORK (Reuters) - DoubleLine Capital, an investment firm that has been a major rival of Pimco, saw between $400 million and $500 million of net inflows on Friday in the wake of Bill Gross' departure from Pimco, DoubleLine ceo Jeffrey Gundlach said on Monday. Asked about the leadership shakeup on Friday, Gundlach said: "I think it is an option" that Mohamed El-Erian, who resigned as Pimco's CEO in January, may return. "Mohamed coming back is an option because he has a relationship with Allianz." El-Erian was named into the newly created role of chief economic adviser at Allianz in February. Friday, Gundlach told Reuters that he and Bill Gross met the week before last to discuss a possible role for Gross at DoubleLine. Their meeting, which took place at Gundlach's home, was three hours long over a range of issues, Gundlach added. Before then, Gundlach and Gross had never met. Gundlach said Gross was "respectful, extremely polite and professional." Gundlach said: "I am CEO of the firm. We talked about working together, but I was never going to be the 'co-guy.' I am CEO. That was never going to happen." Gundlach added: "I thought we had a lot in common." Gross then called Gundlach Thursday evening and left a voicemail message saying that he was leaving Pimco for another firm and would not be joining DoubleLine.

YouTube/ZAGATDavid Einhorn just made over $92 million on a bagel company. Einstein Noah Restaurant Group announced on Monday that it reached an agreement to be acquired for $20.25 per share in cash, or approximately $374 million. In afternoon trade on Monday, shares of Einstein were up more than 50% to about $20.15. David Einhorn's hedge fund, Greenlight Capital, is the largest stockholder of Einstein Noah Restaurant Group and owns more than 35% of its shares, according to the company. According to data from Bloomberg, Einhorn owns more than 13 million shares of Einstein, a stake worth more than $270 million at current prices. Einhorn called the deal a "win-win for all parties." Einstein Noah Restaurant Group, or ENRG, is the largest operator of bagel bakeries in the US. The group owns three independent brands: Einstein Bros Bagels, Noah's New York Bagels, and Manhattan Bagel. And we've decided to take a look at some of the bagels offered at these different chains. First up, Einstein Bros Bagels. There are over 600 Einstein Bros Bagels found in 40 states, according to the ENRG website. Here's what an Einstein Bros Bagels breakfast looks like. This one is a ham and Swiss omelet on a sesame bagel (plus the coffee). Flickr Just like many other breakfast chains, Einstein Bagel Bros recently embraced the autumnal pumpkin craze. This customer snapped a photo of a pumpkin latte and a pumpkin bagel. Happy fall.  And although bagels tend to be major calorie bombs with little nutritional value, Einstein Bros Bagels actually advertises the healthiness of their bagels.   They also offer very skinny bagels called "Thintastic Bagels", and they're about half the calorie value of the traditional bagels. They look more like English muffins than bagels, though. Foursquare Noah's are only located in California, Oregon and Washington. According the ENRG website, "Noah's New York Bagels are designed to whimsically imitate an authentic New York deli." Here's what Noah's thinks that looks like: This is one of their breakfast sandwich bagels.  Flickr This one's an onion bagel with tomatoes, cucumbers and onions. Foursquare Here are two more bagels from one of their San Francisco locations. The one on the right is a cheese-bagel hybrid. Foursquare And last but not least... Manhattan Bagel offers 24-fresh baked bagel varieties. It's "an East Coast favorite for those with discriminating tastes," according to the ENRG website. Look at all those bagel varieties. There's even a chocolate chip bagel in there. Foursquare Here's a Manhattan Bagel lunch sandwich. Complete with a pickle.

REUTERS/Carlos Barria  It's the second day of major protests in Hong Kong, and the crowds in Hong Kong's central business district are unreal. By many accounts they're significantly bigger than they were the night before, as many protesters camped out all night. The protests — dubbed "Occupy Central" — have been primarily fueled by younger Hong Kong residents, angry at what they see as Beijing's slowly taking away Hong Kong's democracy. China recently placed restrictions on Hong Kong's 2017 election of its top civil leader, saying the candidates would have to be vetted by Beijing, according to CNN. There are also economic concerns relating to inequality and the price of housing. School classes have been suspended because of the protests, which don't seem like they'll be letting up soon, CNN reports. Riot police were brought in to control the crowds and were shooting tear gas and pepper spray at protestors. Above is a photo, taken earlier Monday, showing protesters who were blocking the main street to the financial Central district. Here's what it looked like on Monday night: Carlos Barria/Reuters Here are some more: These images also drive home how big things are right now.

Thomson ReutersSun rises to the east of the U.S. Federal Reserve building in WashingtonSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve will likely start raising interest rates in mid-2015, but so slowly that rates will end the year at just 0.55 percent, according to a San Francisco Fed study of betting in futures markets released on Monday. By the end of 2016, rates will have risen to just 1.4 percent, based on options contracts on short-term interest-rate futures, according to San Francisco Fed economist Michael Bauer. The paper argues that options are better gauges of market expectations than futures contracts themselves when interest rates are near zero. The bets suggest traders see the Fed raising rates at about half the pace that Fed officials themselves do. Fed officials see rates ending 2015 at 1.375 percent, and 2016 at 2.875 percent, based on the median of forecasts released by the U.S. central bank earlier this month. It is the second study from the San Francisco Fed this month that suggests market expectations on rate hikes are behind the curve as seen by the Fed. Unlike the earlier study, Bauer's does not explicitly compare market expectations to Fed officials' forecasts, but focuses instead on a comparison of options and futures. Futures contracts suggest a slightly more aggressive path of rate hikes than options, Bauer wrote, but such a reading of markets is "misleading" because it does not take into account the fact that near-zero interest rates prevent traders from the two-sided betting that is possible when rates are above zero. "Option-based estimates of the most likely policy path indicate that market participants expect liftoff to occur around the middle of 2015, and further expect the subsequent policy tightening to be gradual," Bauer wrote. The Fed has held interest rates at zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008.   (Reporting by Ann Saphir; Editing by Chris Reese) FREE AppDownload
Carlos Barria/ReutersA vehicle drives among protesters blocking the main street to the financial Central district, outside the government headquarters, in Hong Kong September 29, 2014.When 1,200 university students calmly staged a sit-in outside Hong Kong’s government offices on Friday to call for greater democracy, no one foresaw the chain of events that transformed the city into a battlefield wreathed with tear gas just 48 hours later. But as the police desperately and aggressively tried to disperse the protestors, they only succeeded in inflaming a public already angry at Beijing’s creeping interference in their lives. The first mistake came when officers pepper-sprayed students in front of the television cameras. In one video clip that went viral, an elderly lady who had come to observe the protest was swivelled around by a police man who then sprayed her in the face. Soon, thousands of people flocked to the government compound to watch what was going on, chanting to the police: “Don’t harm the students!” Many of the tens of thousands who occupied downtown Hong Kong through Sunday and Monday said they had come after seeing the violence of the police on television. Stephanie Wong, a 36-year-old who joined a huge crowd outside Hong Kong Police Headquarters after finishing work yesterday (MON) afternoon said: “People are outraged at the way police behaved and a lot of us are here in solidarity today with the students who were subjected to that.” As they were faced with ever more protestors, however, the police simply doubled down their strategy, hoping to disperse the crowds quickly by firing tear gas. Carlos Barria/ReutersThe Communist government in Beijing made clear it would not tolerate dissent, and warned against any foreign interference as thousands of protesters massed for a fourth night in the free-wheeling, capitalist city of more than 7 million people.  “The police force management realise they got it badly wrong. Their aim was to clear the centre of Hong Kong before the working week began on Monday at all costs but they miscalculated the resistance they would come up against,” one police source told The Telegraph. “By going in so forcefully with tear gas and pepper spray, they have just brought more and more people out on the streets.” He added: “A lot of the officers who were there on Sunday had already been on duty for 30 hours when trouble broke out and there were no reserves to take their places on Monday. So it was a gamble that backfired and now they are swamped by protestors.” On Monday, police officers manning checkpoints around the protest areas were visibly exhausted, with some dozing against barriers in the afternoon sun before being prodded awake by their commanders. Hong Kong has 25,000 police officers to respond to the protests, and may shortly run out of manpower. The police, however, insisted it had only used “appropriate and necessary force” and “only the minimum necessary”. A spokesman denied that any rubber or plastic bullets had been fired, contrary to rumours. Carlos Barria/ReutersA man cooks sausages for protestors on September 29, 2014. Both Hong Kong and Beijing have labelled the protests as illegal and it is unclear how much longer the authorities will tolerate such an embarrassing situation, especially ahead of China’s National Day on Wednesday. In the Global Times, a nationalistic state-run newspaper, an editorial blasted the protests as the work of “anti-China forces”. Wang Qiang, a professor at the People’s Armed Police college, said “no sovereign country can tolerate this kind of incident indefinitely”. He added that it was within China’s law and constitution for the People’s Armed Police to be sent to Hong Kong to resolve the crisis. “The PAP is an armed force set up to maintain social stability and national security and has the duty of dealing with riots, serious criminal acts and so on. Armed police are part of China’s power and can be used according to national law […] If the armed police is needed to carry out security tasks there are no barriers to it in the law,” he wrote. His editorial was later scrubbed from the Global Times’ website. Zhang Lifan, a historian in Beijing, said the two sides were playing “a game of cat and mouse”. “Just because the riot police have withdrawn, it does not mean the government in Hong Kong or Beijing sanctions the protests,” he said. “The same thing happened before June 4 (the Tiananmen massacre). When the students were aggressive, the government sometimes fell back,” he said. He added that opinions among the Beijing leadership were currently divided on whether to launch a hardline response. “But certainly CY Leung (Hong Kong’s chief executive) and Beijing’s representative in Hong Kong will both be in trouble”.

Deutsche Bank's Torsten Slok just circulated an email making a big statement about the economy: secular stagnation is over. Secular stagnation, the theory first posited by Larry Summers last year in a speech at the IMF, basically says that we are in a new economic equilibrium that will see slower growth than we've seen since World War II.  In his note, Slok writes: The latest data for retail sales, durable goods, ISM, and jobless claims have been pointing to accelerating growth and the consensus expects 3% growth for the coming 6 quarters (type OUTL &lt;Go&gt; in BBG to see consensus expectations). In other words, the headwinds are fading and we are about to break out from the two percent GDP growth range that we have been in over the past four years, see also the chart below. This means higher nonfarm payrolls and lower unemployment going forward. And a more and more hawkish Fed." So there you have it: according to at least one Wall Street economist, our recent economic malaise is over.  Here's the chart to back it up. Deutsche Bank FREE AppDownload

Thomson ReutersTraders work on the floor of the NYSE as they wait for a final price on the Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. IPO, in New YorkNEW YORK (Reuters) - Chinese e-commerce heavyweight Alibaba Group Holding Ltd's options contracts were active in their first day of trading on U.S. exchanges on Monday, with bullish and bearish bets about even in the early going. Options volume for Alibaba was 45,000 contracts, with 24,000 calls and 21,000 puts traded so far, according to data from options analytics firm Trade Alert. A relatively equal number of calls and puts implies equal numbers of bets on the Alibaba stock  climbing or falling from current levels. At a size of more than $25 billion, Alibaba's IPO is ranked as the world's biggest and saw some 368 million shares sold. The trading in Alibaba's options was orderly with almost 70 percent of calls and 75 percent of puts trading between the bid and ask prices, said J.J. Kinahan, chief market strategist at retail brokerage TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. "It is a credit to the market makers that the market looks at Alibaba as being at the proper volatility right now," said Kinahan. The 30-day implied volatility for the options was at 41.54 percent according to Livevol data. Implied volatility of Chinese Internet stocks Weibo Corp and Baidu Inc were at 60.82 percent and 36.43 percent, respectively. Implied volatility, a measure of the risk that big moves in the stock pose and a key factor in setting options prices, is typically high for stocks that have recently had their initial public offering. Alibaba shares, which rose about 38 percent in their trading debut on the New York Stock Exchange on Sept. 19, were trading down about 2 percent at $88.96 in early trade on Monday.

Flickr/synapticismHong Kong's expat area. Due to the current conflict in Hong Kong, we are running this item to explore what life has been like for an expat. Hong Kong is known for terrific hotels, great food, buzzing nightlife, and inspiring attractions. Oh, and it's one of the highly populated destinations for expats in all of Asia. Photo courtesy of Tim Robbins/FodorsTim Robbins, a 32 year-old from the country, originally pursued a career in classical piano before heading to law school. Currently working as a lawyer in the field of international commercial arbitration, he moved to Hong Kong two years ago to find a whole lot of pedestrians, attractions off the beaten path, and the city's beaches. I'd never given much thought to Hong Kong before moving here. It was never on my radar. I knew the city had a particular fetish for skyscrapers, and that there was a huge expat community.  What I didn't realize was how small the expat community was within the grand picture. While Hong Kong is very much an international city and a world financial center, it is still very much a Cantonese city, and you don't have to venture far from Central district to discover it. What also strikes you is how the city has the glitz and the grit shoved side by side—around the corner from one of a thousand luxury boutiques you'll find a run-down alley with dingy street vendors or a wet market. It's part of Hong Kong's charm—this city accepts who it is and owns it.   Sweat and pedestrian rage come to mind. Summers can be slightly oppressive between the high temperatures and humidity, and work attire only adds to the suffering. Thankfully no one will judge you if you walk into a meeting half-soaked with sweat, as everyone in the room has been there at some point. Walking down the street can be an exercise in self-control: slow-pace walking and constant swerving are apparently taught in grade school here.  As someone who thinks transit is a waste of time, I've developed a slight tick as a result. Language is also a bit of an issue. Although English and Cantonese are both official languages, I regularly encounter difficulties communicating, particularly with taxi drivers and with store/restaurant staff away from the expat areas (to be fair, my Cantonese is non-existent, and my nearly non-existent Mandarin is of little assistance). To avoid communication errors, which result in a trip to the wrong side of the island, there's a great Hong Kong Taxi app. The banks print their own money here! Capitalism at its finest (laughing). And I had no idea that Hong Kong had beaches.  It's such a fantastic perk to live downtown in a major city and have access to great beaches in a short (and cheap) 20-40 minute cab ride. The south side of the island is a completely different world to the main financial district.  I was also taken aback by the style of wet markets around the city, and often in quite central areas. The sheer amount of raw meat hanging in the street is not what I had expected to come across, and it piques my curiosity when I see ox tails on display for purchase (by the looks of them, quite fresh from the ox). I was adventuring in Long Ping a few weeks back (a neighborhood in the New Territories), and was lucky enough to be sprayed with fish blood as I passed a particularly violent butcher. One of the best things about Hong Kong is the easy access to nature. Hikes on Lantau (feel free to skip the tourist trap that is the Big Buddha) provide stunning views from some of Hong Kong's highest peaks. I'd also recommend adventuring out to Sai Kung for great hikes to secluded beaches, and there are places you can rent kayaks cheaply by the hour. If you are craving a Buddha fix, I had a good laugh up at the 10,000 Buddhas temple in Sha Tin, perhaps the most eclectic collection of Buddhas you will ever come across. While you're up there, check out what exhibits are on display at the Heritage Museum. For people looking for a more somber activity, the Sai Wan War Cemetery at Wan Chai (east end of the Island MTR line) is worth a trip. The memorial is for Allied troops who died in the Second World War, and is in a stunning setting. Dining is fantastic in Hong Kong. Most apartments are quite small with tragically petite kitchens, so people spend as much time out of the apartment as possible (I don't know how to cook anyway). Dim sum is the local specialty, and there are plenty of good cheap options. Sichuan is my favorite of the Chinese cuisines (I'm a sucker for spice), and hot pot nights are a great way to share a meal with friends. There is the occasional dish that makes one wish they had said no—chicken joints, pig intestine, geoduck (Google this for a good laugh), and mystery kidney, just to name a few. Thankfully, there are enough Western options to satisfy cravings as they arise. There is a noted lack in quality chicken wings. We've managed to hunt down a place in North Point that has the best wings in town so far (The Big Bite).  Be wary though—in true Asian style, they have a different take on spice than most Western palates. By far my favorite is the exchange of business cards or money: you offer the item with both hands, thumbs pressed down on top. It seems so quaint and civilized, although it becomes slightly awkward when both persons are attempting to exchange cards at the same time. On the religious front, there are great little Buddhist temples around the city, sometimes wedged between skyscrapers. Individuals or small groups come to light incense and pray. I enjoy the food offerings that have been left for departed loved ones, which range from a selection of fruits to chicken and rice dinners and the occasional can of cheap beer. Not to dwell on the departed, but Hong Kong's cemeteries are visually striking as well; they are staggered on the side of mountains, with the most sought after locations overlooking the sea. One of the challenges with dining in Hong Kong is hunting down all of the thousands of restaurants you've never heard of. As the world's most vertical city, there are restaurants hidden away in skyscrapers across the city, the vast majority of which you'd never find without guidance. One of my favorite restaurants, Mum Chau's, is tucked away on the fifth floor of a decrepit building in the heart of Lan Kwai Fung. Sohocontinues to produce some great new venues; Brickhouse and Chicha (Mexican and Peruvian tapas, respectively) are two of my favorites in the past year. Honi Honi (Polynesian tiki bar) has a great vibe and interesting cocktails, and Boujis is a new members club that's fun for a night out.   The rent! I share a 500 square foot apartment with another lawyer, as renting on my own seems like an extravagance I can't afford with student debt. The real estate here is slightly out of control, which makes it difficult for many locals. There are many depressing stories of so-called "cage living," with a number of residents in spaces less than 40 square feet. And this is where I admit my guilt and shame for complaining about my apartment. Definitely staying for longer! I'm not done with Hong Kong yet. Part of the benefit of living here is that Hong Kong is a great gateway for most of Asia. The airport is extremely convenient and efficient, and there are tons of options for weekend getaways around China and southeast Asia.  I feel like I've barely scraped the surface in my first 18 months!  After tons of ups, downs and adjustments in my first year, I think I have officially developed a bit of a crush on Hong Kong.  It may not be the right place forever, but it's an amazing place to spend a few (or more than a few) years.

BICarpe diem!The stock of video-camera maker GoPro (GPRO) is having another banner day, blasting up 5% on news that the company is launching some new cameras. The stock is now at $87, double where it was a month ago and more than 3X its IPO price in June. Since the IPO, of course, a parade of market pundits has declared GoPro's stock performance an obvious sign of insanity. And if the stock price was obviously crazy three months ago, it's presumably even more obviously wacko now at more than twice the price. So, is it really crazy?  Or are GoPro speculators reasonably assessing the company's long-term opportunity? To answer that question definitively, you would have to know what GoPro's financial performance will be for the next 100-plus years. You would also have to discount that performance (annual cash flow) at a rate that appropriately compensated you for the risk associated with the stock. Without knowing those things, we can't know for sure whether GoPro's valuation is "insane" until we see how the future unfolds. But here's one way to think about it. In their early rocketship-growth years, high-growth stocks can often trade at very high multiples of earnings or revenue. Inevitably, however, at some point, growth slows, and stock multiples compress. Eventually, the stocks of all healthy companies usually trade in a range of about 10X to 20X earnings — which is to say, they trade at average market multiples.   So if you want to get a sense of whether GoPro's valuation is nuts, it's helpful to think about what level of earnings would be required to support the stock's current and future valuation. (By the way, if you don't believe that today's hottest stocks will eventually trade at 10X to 20X earnings — or lower — just look at what happened to the hottest stocks of the 1990s. The stocks of Yahoo, Cisco, Microsoft, and many other red-hot tech companies were trading at extremely high multiples — often 50X to 200X earnings. Today, these stocks all trade at 10X to 20X earnings. Today's high fliers will be no different.) YahooGoPro to the moon ... So how much profit would GoPro have to generate to justify today's valuation? Let's run the numbers ... GoPro's current market value is $11 billion. Right now, GoPro isn't consistently making money (the company earned $60 million last year but had a GAAP loss in Q2), but that's OK. Growth-stock valuations aren't based on what the companies are earning today. They're based on what the companies are expected to earn in the future. As long as future profits are enough to allow the stock's multiple to "regress" to an average level and still provide today's investor with a reasonable rate of return, then the stock's current multiple is irrelevant. At 10X to 20X earnings, GoPro would need profit of $550 million to $1.1 billion to support its current market capitalization. If GoPro earned $550 million to $1.1 billion in 10 years, and the stock traded at 10X to 20X earnings, then the stock would fairly trade at about the same level as today. Of course, most of today's investors would be unhappy with that performance. They would want and expect a healthy annual return. How big a return? Well, given the high level of uncertainty and risk around GoPro, most investors would probably want the stock to at least double over 10 years if not triple. So, we have our answer. To justify today's stock price on the basis of discounted cash flow, GoPro will have to generate $1 billion to $3 billion of profit in 10 years. How likely is that? Well, GoPro is currently generating about $1 billion of revenue on an annualized rate. GoPro is primarily a hardware company, and hardware companies generally have low profit margins. GoPro is trying to become a media company, and media companies can have higher profit margins. So a reasonable future profit margin assumption for a successful GoPro might be, say, 15%. To generate $1 billion to $3 billion of profit at a 15% profit margin, GoPro would need revenue of $5 billion to $15 billion. So we have another way of looking at our answer. To assess whether GoPro's current stock price is "insane," we have to ask ourselves how likely it is that GoPro will grow its annual revenue from $1 billion today to $5-$15 billion in a decade and generate a 15% profit margin. If GoPro remains the only sport video camera maker that anyone has ever heard of, and if GoPro successfully builds a media platform that makes it the only real choice for anyone who wants to record action video (thus increasing profit margin and lock-in), then the idea that GoPro will grow revenue to $5-$15 billion in 10 years doesn't seem insane. It's a big world, and lots of people will want cameras like GoPros. However! If that line of thinking makes you think that GoPro at $87 is a slam-dunk great investment, it's worth sketching another possible future for GoPro. Remember "Flip"? Five years ago, when it came to digital video, Flip cameras were all the rage.  People were so stoked about the future of Flip, in fact, that Cisco paid $500 million for the company. Then the iPhone arrived and obliterated Flip. And Cisco was forced to shut it down and write off the whole thing. That's how it often goes in the hardware business (and, for that matter, in other fast-moving businesses). So anyone who thinks GoPro is assured of even 10 great years of growth, let alone a century, is hallucinating. No one is assured of anything, least of all GoPro. In the short-term, of course, GoPro's stock will likely trade on momentum and sentiment rather than valuation.

 REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui Despite the return of some growth in the advanced economies, four eminent economists warned in a report released this weekend that the global economy is still highly leveraged, and at serious risk of another financial crisis.  This year's Geneva Report, from the Center for Economic Policy Research, was written by Luigi Buttiglione at Brevan Howard, Philip Lane at Trinity College Dublin, Lucrezia Reichlin at London Business School, and Morgan Stanley's chief UK economist Vincent Reinhart.  The main points of the report can be explained in the two graphs below.  First, the developed world is not deleveraging. In fact, more debt is being accumulated as economies finally begin to grow a little, following years of stagnation.  McKinsey Global Institute, CEPR The world’s emerging markets provide an equally worrying picture. The financial crisis was barely a speed bump for debt accumulation in developing economies.  McKinsey Global Institute, CEPR Why does it matter? Well the authors think this dynamic has the potential to be a doom loop: "Deleveraging and slower nominal growth are in many cases interacting in a vicious loop, with the latter making the deleveraging process harder and the former exacerbating the economic slowdown. Moreover, the global capacity to take on debt has been reduced through the combination of slower expansion in real output and lower inflation." It's a pretty brutal take. The financial crisis demonstrates some of the risks of major debt accumulation, but that's even worse when growth and inflation are both low. If someone (or some country's) income grows more slowly than expected, then paying back, or making interest payments, becomes more difficult.  Not only that, but when investors realise that growth is slowing, perhaps permanently, estimations of how much debt the economy can safely afford to bear are rapidly slashed.   Suddenly, as in the 2008 financial crisis, the "excessive optimism" becomes obvious, and investors adjust their understanding of the economy's debt capacity down.  Geneva report, CEPRIn the worst scenario, the authors explain what happens:  "The recognition of excessive optimism triggers the understanding that the nation has already over-borrowed relative to its capacity to repay. To live within the limit of this lower level of debt capacity, borrowing has to contract, representing a more significant headwind to continued economic expansion." The Geneva reports are not some fringe publication. Previous authors include renowned economic historian Barry Eichengreen, the ECB’s Benoit Coeure, Roger Ferguson of the Fed and Mario Draghi, the head of the European Central Bank. For now, it's just a grim outlook, and hopefully does not turn into a grim reality.  FREE AppDownload
Getty Images/Andrew BurtonShares of Civeo Corporation were down more than 45% on Monday. Civeo, which provides housing accommodations to oil-drilling companies, announced on Monday that it would not pursue a conversion into a real estate investment trust, or REIT. Investors were not thrilled.  The company also announced that it would redomicile to Canada under a "self-directed redomiciling," which is allowable under US tax law if a company has "substantial business activity" in the country to which it is moving. Kind of like an inversion, but not exactly.  But the big news is that the company decided not to pursue a REIT structure. A REIT trades on an exchange and generates income through rent collection and investment in additional properties or mortgages.  REITs find favor with some investors because they are required to pay out at least 90% of their taxable income in the form of dividends.  In opting not to pursue a REIT structure, the company said in a statement: "The board and its advisers evaluated the potential effects of a REIT conversion on earnings, valuation and operational flexibility and determined that redomiciling the company to Canada offers a superior result to a REIT conversion. The primary factors considered include: "These key factors result in the REIT conversion being net present value negative, which the board took into account in concluding that redomiciling the company to Canada offers a better alternative. Further, the company's C-corp structure offers superior operational and financial flexibility coupled with a lower tax rate under the migration transaction without the significant upfront costs." Civeo, which was spun out from Oil States International in June, also said it expected sequentially lower results in the fourth quarter.  FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Jacky NaegelenHeaded back to the skies.After two weeks, Air France pilots ended a strike that had been costing the airline $25 million a day.  However, it doesn't really sound like anything was resolved. Reuters reported that the pilots returned to skies due more to resignation over a lack of progress than to anything resembling a settling of differences. The core disagreement involved Transavia, a low-cost carrier that Air France-KLM hopes to expand both in France and across Europe. Transavia pilots aren't compensated as generously as Air France pilots, and Air France-KLM has balked at negotiating for parity as it expands outside France. Ergo, the strike. Reuters noted that "[t]he dispute highlighted discrepancies in wages, labor conditions and welfare coverage between European countries which are theoretically part of a single market for goods and services, but in fact compete with each other for jobs." To observers of Europe's problems since the financial crisis, this isn't news. The union isn't really all in it together, as weaker economies offer what to workers in stronger economies look like labor policies that tilt in favor of lower wages and fewer benefits.  The New York Times' Eduardo Porter astutely summarized the trend last year. "Tethered to the euro and thus unable to devalue their currency to help make their goods less expensive in export markets, many European countries — especially those along the Continent’s southern rim that have been hammered by the financial crisis — have been furiously dismantling workplace protections in a bid to reduce the cost of labor," he wrote. The Air France pilots strike was all about this new reality. It ended inconclusively. But the dispute hasn't disappeared, so it would be foolish to expect that the pilots won't walk out again. The question is whether doing so will ultimately make much of a difference.   FREE AppDownload

ReutersA protester prepares for a possible tear gas attack as hundreds of protesters block a main road at Hong Kong's shopping Mongkok district on Monday.Hong Kongers have taken to the streets of the city, furious that Beijing will no longer allow citizens to democratically elect their political leaders. Beijing is just as furious. If attempts to block images of protests on social media like Instagram and Weibo are any indication, it will not tolerate dissent for long.  Behind closed doors, Beijing has been more direct. In a meeting with Hong Kong leaders in August, Beijing's liaison to the island, Zhang Xiaoming, told Hong Kong leaders, “The fact that you are allowed to stay alive, already shows the country's inclusiveness." According to Reuters, everyone in the room was shocked. It was a clear sign that Xi Jinping's China — a China of political-corruption drives and power consolidated in the office of the president — had a new vision for Hong Kong. Since rejoining China in 1997 after being under British rule, Hong Kong has been able to elect its own leaders. That was the deal then-Chinese President Deng Xiaoping made with the late British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.  Hong Kong, along with Macau, would exist under a specific political identity — it would become a "special administrative region" until 2047. SARs don't have to be socialist like the mainland, and they can maintain their own legal systems. At least, that was the case until Xi became president of China. Now Beijing is going back on that promise. In a white paper written this summer, mainland leaders said that Hong Kong's constitutional autonomy was not "an inherent power." Instead of allowing fully democratic elections, Beijing wants to select the candidates who can run in Hong Kong in 2017. Autonomy is over. In other words, it's time to conform to the mainland, or else.  FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersAn illustration picture shows the logo of car-sharing service app Uber on a smartphone next to the picture of an official German taxi signFRANKFURT (Reuters) - Online transportation company Uber said on Monday it would offer services using regular, licensed taxi drivers in Germany, where taxi associations have been trying to stop it operating. Uber said it would start its UberTaxi service -- which uses regular taxi drivers to pick up rides in their down time -- in Berlin and Hamburg before rolling it out in other cities. While UberTaxi's prices often undercut those of the regular taxi organizations trying to block the company, the service can benefit individual drivers by finding them passengers at times they would otherwise have been waiting on a stand. The UberTaxi service is already running in London and New York and Uber is starting it in Germany after attempts to launch other services were blocked. Courts in Berlin and Hamburg have banned Uber's classic low-cost, limousine pick-up service UberBlack as well as UberPop, a newer ride-sharing service that links private drivers with passengers. The courts said Uber's drivers did not comply with German law for the commercial transportation of passengers. Uber also said it would modify its UberBlack service to comply with the Berlin court ruling -- while also appealing against it -- and was considering contesting the Hamburg ruling. Uber, which was recently valued at $18 billion, has been shadowed by skirmishes with taxi operators and local authorities in many cities where it operates, starting in its home base of San Francisco. It is active in 43 countries and has pulled out of only one city: Vancouver, Canada. The Berlin court said last week there was no way of telling whether private drivers using the UberPop mobile phone app were fit for the special responsibility of carrying passengers. It said the UberBlack service did not meet the legal requirement for taxis to return to their service center and so fell between regulations for taxi and rental car services.

The general business activity index moved up to a reading of 10.8, nearly four points above its nonrecession average of 7. The company outlook index rose from 1.5 to 5.8, due to a larger share of firms noting an improved outlook in September than in August," the report said.

Wikimedia CommonsThe red area is where Rosneft found oil.Russia's state-owned oil company Rosneft just found oil in the Arctic. Rosneft announced on Saturday that it discovered oil in the Universitetskaya structure — a 1,200 square kilometer area in the Kara Sea inside the Arctic Circle. The announcement states that the entire resource base is estimated to be 87 billion barrels (or 13 billions tonnes of oil), larger than the Gulf of Mexico and potentially comparable to the resource base of Saudi Arabia. Rosneft has been exploring three East Prinovozemelskiy areas of the Kara Sea under an agreement with ExxonMobil.  But there is a problem: after October 10, Exxon and Rosneft won't be able to continue the joint exploration because of US sanctions against Russia. According to a Bloomberg report:  "The well was drilled before the Oct. 10 deadline Exxon was granted by the US government under sanctions barring American companies from working in Russia's Arctic offshore. Rosneft and Exxon won't be able to do more drilling, putting the exploration and development of the area on hold despite the find announced [on Saturday]." Rosneft doesn't have the ability to drill in cold offshore conditions by itself, Standard Life Investments strategist Frances Hudson told Bloomberg.  And Rosneft can't even rely on other state-owned companies because they don't know how to do it either, according to Hudson. But Russia really needs these Arctic oil reserves. "As Russia's existing fields in Siberia run dry, the country needs to develop new reserves as it vies with the US to be the world's largest oil and gas producer," Bloomberg reported. This is bad news for Exxon, too: Russia is the company's second-biggest exploration area.  (via Bloomberg) FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersThe logo of Swiss bank UBS is seen at the entrance of an office building in ZurichLONDON (Reuters) - A corporate structure unveiled by UBS AG  on Monday will lead to higher shareholder returns in the long run, Chief Financial Officer Tom Naratil told Reuters. Switzerland's largest bank is creating a new group holding company in response to regulatory demands aimed at ensuring banks are easier to break up if they run into trouble. "In the long run it will (increase return on equity)," Naratil told Reuters, adding it was hard to assess the exact uplift on returns but that without a group holding company UBS could have been forced to hold more capital, leading to lower returns per unit of capital. "It's clearly the biggest move that we have had to make in our corporate structure," Naratil said, adding that the existing bank legal structure, which revolved around a parent company and branches, was the most effective before the Basel III global banking rules but was no longer optimal. UBS, which has radically reformed its business after the financial crisis by greatly scaling back its fixed income activities, has been working on the new corporate structure for three years, according to documents published on Monday. It also considered an alternative involving forcing assets out of its existing parent company, but concluded this would be "very complex and time consuming", Naratil said. Such a plan could have taken up many more years and would have required complicated discussions with debt holders, Naratil added.   (Reporting by Laura Noonan; Editing by David Holmes) FREE AppDownload

REUTERS/Danny MoloshokBillions and billions and billions...The Forbes 400 is out, and Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk is Number 50 on the list of America's richest people. His net worth is listed by Forbes as $9.2 billion, a far cry from Number One, Microsoft c0-founder Bill Gates at $81.2 billion, or even a cluster of Wal-Mart heirs in the $30-million-plus category. At Number Ten, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg ($34.7 billion) is almost four times richer than Musk. But in the U.S. auto industry, Musk is the richest by miles. His closest competition in discount tire tycoon Bruce Halle (#107, $4.7 billion). At 43, he's also the youngest automotive billionaire on the list. In fact, the only other billionaire in his forties is Dan Friedkin (#171, $3.3 billion), a Houston-based businessman whose family controls Toyota distribution in several southern states. Musk earned his first big payout when eBay bought PayPal in 2002. His fortune has surged in the past few years, following the IPOs of both Tesla Motors and Solar City (he's Chairman of the latter). He's also CEO of SpaceX, and rumors have been bubbling of late that suggest that the private space startup could be worth as much as $10 billion. So he could be set for another massive payday. That said, Tesla and SpaceX have been volatile sources of wealth over the past few months.  If you look at Musk's path to richness, it's actually fairly impressive. The native of South Africa has essentially tried to re-invent banking, create the first successful electric-car company in human history, revive the species' passion for interplanetary exploration, and wean us from our dependence on fossil fuels as an energy source. Bill Gates marketed an operating system. Mark Zuckerberg developed a better way for us to like pictures of each other. Fine achievements, to be sure. And both men are sure to move mountains through philanthropy. But they aren't trying to "back up the biosphere" or make humanity "multiplanetary" — two of Musk's ambitious goals. There's a reason why Musk is such an object of fascination both inside and outside the worlds of wealth and technology.  FREE AppDownload

Thomson ReutersA man looks at a price tag as he shops at a supermarket in HefeiPARIS (Reuters) - China's role in supplying cheap consumer goods to the West could end in coming years due to rising domestic consumption and worker pay, stoking inflation and unsettling retailers in Western markets, the chairman of logistics group Li &amp; Fung  warned. "China will disrupt the world," William Fung of Hong Kong-based Li &amp; Fung, which supplies firms like Walmart Stores Inc  with clothing and toys, told the World Retail Congress, an annual gathering of retail industry executives, on Monday. China is a country that operates in economic cycles of 30 years, Fung said, and between 1979 and 2009, it had been the world's "factory" producing consumer goods at low prices, notably thanks to the low wages paid to its workers. "For 30 years, China kept consumer prices low and people like us enjoyed very good margins," Fung said. Since 2009 China had started to boost economic growth through greater domestic consumption while wages have risen. "When China starts consuming and with India right behind it, I predict a round of price increases and margin squeezes," he Fung said. Over the next 30 years, China and India could add more than one billion customers - both "an opportunity and a threat" for the retail industry, he added.

AP Images The stock market is on a tremendous, multiyear bull market, though of course there have been a lot of dips along the way. But something seems to be different about the recent sell-off in stocks (which is continuing Monday). Dan Greenhaus of BTIG writes: What we find most interesting about the five session, 2.3% drop in equity prices, is not the shallowness of the decline, nor its length (or lack thereof). It was the speed at which sentiment shifted from bullishness to bearishness. Newspaper articles, television commentary and client interactions all appeared to shift on a dime, suggesting that perhaps, just maybe, people aren’t as comfortable in their bullishness as some may assert. We find this interesting given the table below which details exactly how positive the fourth quarter tends to be. Why is this selloff causing such alarm? It might be because of this chart (and other similar ones), which shows the interest rate on two-year US bonds. FRED Two-year bonds have been in a very long downtrend, reflecting the fact that the market was not anticipating Fed rate hikes for a very long time to come. But as you can see from the chart now, yields on the two-year are at multiyear highs and appear to be in the type of sustained uptrend we just haven't seen since the financial crisis. This is a reflection that the market is seeing the first Fed rate hike sooner rather than later. And in a sense, the rise in short-term rates means the Fed has already begun tightening rates. In the past, markets could be soothed by the belief that any Fed tightening cycle was a long way out. Not anymore.    FREE AppDownload
Reuters "Occupy Central" is what those in Hong Kong are calling the movement to maintain democratic rule on the island. It has been able to assemble hundreds of thousands to demonstrate since July, when Beijing publicized in a white paper that it would no longer tolerate independent rule in Hong Kong. It said that Hong Kong's constitutional autonomy was not "an inherent power." Instead of allowing free and fair elections as it has for the past 20 years, Beijing wants to select candidates who can run for political office in Hong Kong. In a closed-door meeting with Hong Kong leaders in August, Zhang Xiaoming, Beijing's liaison to Hong Kong, told Hong Kong leaders supportive of Occupy Central that, "The fact that you are allowed to stay alive, already shows the country's inclusiveness." So what is happening now says more about changes in Beijing under President Xi Jinping than it does about any revolution on the island. To the contrary, protesters on the ground aren't fighting for change, but rather a return to the commitment that was made to them in 1997 — that they would be able to govern themselves. REUTERS/Carlos Barria A protester blocks the main street to the financial Central district, outside the government headquarters in Hong Kong, on Monday. In 1984, Deng Xiaoping, the leader of China from 1978 to 1992, started talking to the British about getting its island back. The British Empire's rule over Hong Kong would end in 1997, and Deng wanted to work with then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on a plan to bring the territory peacefully back under the Chinese fold. And so special administrative regions were formed — a political classification for territories that could maintain their own legal and political structures while still being a part of China. It was known as "one country, two systems," and was supposed to continue until 2047. Macau is also a SAR. It was a working structure until now. July 1 is Hong Kong's annual day of protest against any perceived incursions on its freedom by the mainland. This year the protests were bigger than ever. Neither side has shown signs of standing down. "I don't see any room now for people to sit down together again and renegotiate unless there would be some significant changes in the government," George Chen, finance editor of the South China Morning Post told the BBC. Chen suggested that the current chief executive, Cy Leung, step down. Still, that won't change Beijing's perception of Hong Kong and what it should mean for the Chinese state.    FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersA Chrysler logo is pictured at the Jacob Javits Convention Center during the New York International Auto Show in New YorkDETROIT (Reuters) - A safety advocate group has petitioned U.S. regulators to open an investigation into an estimated 4.9 million Chrysler vehicles for issues that could lead to engine stalls and other problems, according to documents posted online by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The NHTSA said in the documents that it would decide whether to grant or deny the Center for Auto Safety's petition, which involves a range of Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep SUVs, pickup trucks and minivans from model years 2007 through 2014. The regulator offered no timetable for its decision, but if it opens an investigation, that could lead to a recall. Chrysler Group, a unit of Fiat, said on Monday that it was investigating customer complaints and analyzing parts from the field. "Every Chrysler Group vehicle meets or exceeds all applicable safety standards," it said. The Center for Auto Safety in an Aug. 21 letter asked the NHTSA to open a probe into failures of a part called the totally integrated power module, the documents said. The safety advocate group said the failures resulted in engine stalls; air bag nondeployment; unintended acceleration; fires; and random horn, headlight, door lock, instrument panel and windshield wiper activity, according to the documents. Located in the engine compartment near the battery, the totally integrated power module manages power for multiple systems in the vehicle. It is designed to detect an electrical fault and activate such equipment as windshield wipers and headlights. The Center for Auto Safety's petition included a list of 70 complaints it had received, according to the NHTSA documents. The NHTSA said its review would focus on the Totally Integrated Power Module 7. Of the 63 complaints about that specific part, 51 cited engine stalls or not starting, while three reported smoke or fire, according to the NHTSA documents. In a supplement to its letter, the Center for Auto Safety identified 24 crashes from NHTSA's Early Warning Reporting database that it believes are related to the failure of a totally integrated power module. "The (power module) is in millions of 2007-14 Chrysler vehicles and fails at such high frequency that Chrysler has run out of replacement parts," the Center for Auto Safety said in its letter. "Consumers are faced with a terrible dilemma - park the vehicle until parts are available or ride at risk of being in (a) deadly crash." Earlier this month, Chrysler recalled an estimated 230,760 Jeep and Dodge SUVs globally from model year 2011 because of the potential failure of fuel-pump relays within the power module that could cause the vehicles to stall or not start.

REUTERS/Bobby Yip A student provides supplies on a tram track as thousands of students occupy a main street at Causeway Bay shopping district in Hong Kong September 29, 2014.Stocks fell on Monday after opening sharply lower following a turbulent week and protests in Hong Kong that broke out over the weekend and pressured Asian stocks overnight. First, the scoreboard: And now, the top stories on Monday: 1. The latest report on personal income and outlays showed that "core" personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, which is the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation and excludes the more volatile prices of food and gas, rose 0.1% month-over-month. On a year-over-year basis, "core" PCE rose 1.5%. Personal spending rose 0.5% in August and personal income rose 0.3%. Following the report, Ian Shepherdson at Pantheon Macro said, "In one line: Autos drive August spending up, but Q3 will look pedestrian... Assuming no revisions, that implies Q3 consumption will rise by only 1.6% annualized, down from 2.5% in Q2." 2. Pending home sales in August fell more than expected, falling 1% against expectations for pending home sales to fall 0.5%. On a year-over-year basis, pending home sales fell 4.1% in August. Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors, said of the report: "Fewer distressed homes at bargain prices and the acknowledgment we’re entering a rising interest rate environment likely caused hesitation among investors last month. With investors pulling back, the market is shifting more towards traditional and first-time buyers who rely on mortgages to purchase a home." 3. The Dallas Fed's latest manufacturing report beat expectations, coming in at 10.8 against estimates for a 10.5 reading, and the report said, "Perceptions of broader business conditions were more optimistic this month." 4. Stocks opened lower on Monday and clawed back most of those gains, but on Monday Business Insider's Joe Weisenthal noted a few reasons why the sell-off might be different this time. Short-term Treasury yields have been increasing steadily this year, and Dan Greenhaus of BTIG wrote that the speed at which market sentiment shifted from bullishness to bearishness could find this character of this market changing in ways some investors may not expect.  5. Greenlight Capital's David Einhorn is the largest shareholder of Einstein Noah Restaurant group, which agreed to be acquired for $20.25 per share in deal worth about $374 million. All told, it was a pretty good day for Einhorn. 6. GoPro shares were on a tear again on Monday, gaining more than 11% and bringing the share price above $90 for the first time. It's been about three months since the wearable camera company went public at $24 per share, and Business Insider's Henry Blodget did some quick math to show GoPro investors what kind of revenue and profit performance the company might need to justify its current stock price.  7. Over the last year or so, the idea of "secular stagnation," that the world economy is facing a new limit on potential future growth has become popular among economists after Larry Summers first discussed the idea at the IMF last year. On Monday, Deutsche Bank's Torsten Slok circulated an email that said with economic headwinds fading and expectations for economic growth of more than 3% over the next six quarters, secular stagnation is over. 8. The Russian ruble, as well as the Russian stock market, have been getting crushed as the Russian economy starts to really feel the pain of Western sanctions. On Monday, the ruble fell to about 39.4 against the US dollar, its worst level in more than 10 years.  Don't Miss: Brazil Is Getting Annihilated » FREE AppDownload
Dr. Ed's BlogOver the past few years, there has been lots of buzz about the coming manufacturing renaissance in the US. The central concept is that plentiful and cheap natural gas will convince manufacturers to expand or to move production to the US to cut their energy costs. Labor is still cheaper overseas, but it isn’t as expensive as it once was in the US. Besides, the IT revolution has increased factory productivity with more automation, including robots and the “Internet of Things.” The recent strength in the dollar could be a spoiler if it continues since it reduces the global competitiveness of US exporters and provides a competitive edge for importers. For now, the evidence is finally mounting that the highly anticipated new age in US manufacturing may be happening, though the jury is out on how long it will last. Let’s review the relevant data: (1) Capital spending. One of the strongest components of real GDP in recent quarters has been real capital spending on industrial equipment. It is up 14.7% y/y through Q2, the fastest such pace since Q4-2011. (2) Factory orders. Industrial machinery orders soared to a record high during July. They are up 37.3% y/y. Nondefense capital goods orders excluding aircraft rose to a record high during August. Dr. Ed's BlogToday's Morning Briefing: The Top? (1) Did BABA make the top?

Thomson ReutersChicago Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Evans speaks during the Sasin Bangkok Forum(Reuters) - The Federal Reserve should be "exceptionally patient" in removing monetary policy accommodation, delaying interest-rate hikes until it is confident the U.S. economy can withstand them and only raising rates slowly once it starts, a top Fed official said on Monday. In remarks that largely repeated those he made last Wednesday, Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Evans detailed to a group of economists the reasoning behind his call for restraint on rate increases, even if the result is inflation temporarily breaching the Fed's target of 2 percent. Despite immense progress since the depths of the recession, he said, U.S. inflation remains "stubbornly low," and labor markets harbor more slack than last month's 6.1 percent unemployment rate suggests. In particular, he said, labor force participation has dropped faster than can be accounted for simply by the aging of the population, and wage growth, at just over 2 percent annually, lags the 3 percent to 4 percent that should be expected. "We should be exceptionally patient in adjusting the stance of U.S. monetary policy - even to the point of allowing a modest overshooting of our inflation target," Evans said in remarks prepared for delivery to the National Association of Business Economists in Chicago. "I favor delaying liftoff until I am more certain that we have sufficient momentum in place toward our policy goals. And I think we should plan for our path of policy rate increases to be shallow." Evans rotates into a voting spot on the Fed's policy setting committee in 2015, when most of his colleagues believe will be the year when they begin to raise rates for the first time in years. The Fed has kept short-term interest rates near zero since 2008, and has bought more than $3 trillion in bonds to push borrowing costs down further and to boost investment and hiring. The Fed plans to finish winding down its latest round of bond buying next month, and already some of the U.S. central bank's more hawkish policymakers are calling for interest rate increases. But prematurely restricting monetary conditions could deal a setback to the economy, Evans said on Monday, forcing the Fed to backtrack and prolonging the conditions that have prompted it to pin rates near zero in the first place. "I am very uncomfortable with calls to raise our policy rate sooner than later," Evans said.  (Reporting by Ann Saphir, editing by G Crosse) FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersShoppers ride the escalator at Macy's Herald Square on Thanksgiving Day in New York(Reuters) - Department store operator Macy's Inc said it planned to hire about 86,000 workers for the holiday shopping season, up from about 83,000 last year. Macy's said it would hire about 1,125 for its customer service centers, about 3,000 for delivery and store pickup services for online orders at Macy's and Bloomingdale's stores, and more than 850 to support its holiday events such as the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. The company said it anticipated higher sales in its online  business and was hiring about 10,000 workers to fulfill online orders at its megacenters, including in West Virginia, Arizona, Portland, Tennessee and Connecticut. Macy's hired about 6,600 seasonal workers last year for its online order fulfillment centers. Retailers make nearly a third of their annual sales and generate almost 40 percent of their profits during the selling season that starts a day after Thanksgiving and goes on until early January. Rival Kohl's Corp said this month that it would hire more than 67,000 workers for the holiday shopping season, about 34 percent more than last season.

Thomson ReutersA woman shops with her daughter at a Walmart Supercenter in RogersWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Rising incomes helped American consumers spend more in August, a positive sign for the U.S. economy which appears to be shifting into a higher gear. The Commerce Department said on Monday consumer spending rose 0.5 percent last month after being unchanged in July. The growth in August was just above the median forecast in a Reuters poll of a 0.4 percent gain. Spending was 0.5 percent higher even after adjusting for inflation. Some of the strength in spending came from a decrease in the personal saving rate, which slipped to 5.4 percent from 5.6 percent. Personal income rose 0.3 percent following a 0.2 percent rise the month before, in line with forecasts. The data reinforces the view that the U.S. economy will finish this year firing on nearly all cylinders and that the U.S. Federal Reserve could raise interest rates next year to keep inflation in check. The Fed's preferred gauge of inflation was up 1.5 percent in August from a year earlier, according to the Commerce Department report. That was down slightly from a month earlier. A measure of underlying price pressures which strips out food and energy held at 1.5 percent and has been trending higher this year as the economy has strengthened. The Fed has a 2 percent inflation target. Data on Friday showed the U.S. economy grew at its fastest pace in 2-1/2 years in the second quarter with all sectors contributing to the jump in output.

Expectations were for personal income to rise 0.3% and personal spending to rise 0.4% month-over-month. "Core" PCE, which excludes the cost of food and energy and is the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation, rose 0.1% month-over-month, better than expectations for "core" PCE to be flat.  On a year-over-year basis, "core" PCE rose 1.5%.  The report showed that private wages and salaries rose by $30.4 billion in August, more than the $17.4 billion increase in private wages and salaries in July, while supplements to wages and salaries rose $4.7 billion August against a $3.8 billion increase in July.  In a note to clients following Monday's report, Ian Shepherdson at Pantheon Macro said, "In one line: Autos drive August spending up, but Q3 will look pedestrian... Assuming no revisions, that implies Q3 consumption will rise by only 1.6% annualized, down from 2.5% in Q2." Last month, personal spending unexpectedly declined 0.1%.  FREE AppDownload
Getty Images/Justin Sullivan This is republished with permission from Cramer's Shirt. The author of this post was long Apple at the time of this writing. You can follow him on Twitter at @cramersshirt. It was a rough week for Apple last week. Or was it? First it was discovered that the iPhone 6 Plus was susceptible to “bending.” A software glitch to the first iOS 8 update quickly followed, sending lovers and haters of the world’s largest company into a tizzy.  During its mea culpa, Apple announced that exactly nine people complained about a bend in the company's Plus, and about 40,000 users were affected by the software glitch. The absolute horror! As a reminder, 10 million devices that run iOS 8 were sold just last weekend. Remember these numbers — there’s a quiz later. Many media outlets ran with “bendgate,” spotting YouTube videos of people bending the phone and attempting to bend it. It looked as if all were unsuccessful. Speaking for myself, I wasn’t exactly shocked that the large piece of aluminum would bend when a lot of force was applied, especially if warm. Still, it was clear to me that some of these folks had alternative motives, so why even try? “It bends when I do this, doctor.” … "Umm, don’t do that?” Anyway, I found myself at the mall running an errand and wanted to bend, excuse me, see, for myself. It’s easy for some guy to cry foul from the comfort of his living room; why not have an informed opinion? Cramer's ShirtAt the mall. As I approached the store, I was greeted by a long line and large crowd. First assumption: it’s not hurting sales. As I spoke to some people (folks waiting in a long line are almost too happy to chat with anyone who may saunter by), I asked them if they heard about “bendgate.” To a man … and woman … they had heard the news, and the typical response, “Why would I try and bend it?” was followed closely by, “If it does bend, I feel confident that Apple will replace it.” Indeed customer, indeed. Armed with this information, I entered a store operating like a finely tuned watch, much the same as it had on launch day, my most recent visit. I had my pick of locations to examine the iPhone Plus, so I chose a discrete spot toward the middle of the store with my back to most of the crowd. I picked it up in my hand, as expected light, yet sturdy, for lack of a better term. Now I was curious. Cramer's ShirtInside the Apple Store. After watching some of the videos online I knew what the supposed weak spot was. (From watching others, they were just guessing.) Taking my thumbs, I pressed and pushed in toward my hands that were firmly around the rest of the phone covering the entirety of the screen on the other side. It bent. Cramer's Shirt “Hey, you bent the phone!” a girl next to me said. Her friend soon joined her to look. “I tried and couldn’t,” she said. Her friend echoed her statement. Soon I was surrounded by a group of 10 people. “How did you do that?” asked someone else. “I used my hands,” I said. “I think it’s kinda cool they make it so it bends,” another said.  At this point I thought it best to leave the store. Did I feel bad about bending it a bit? Not really — others were trying, and I walked past a person attempting the same thing on the way to the exit. If they made me buy the phone, there would have been worse tragedies. I would have received a Plus with no wait with a screen still appearing crystal clear and functioning perfectly.  For their part, Apple employees didn’t seem to care or notice any wannabe Mr. Wizards. My take is they’ve grown accustomed this week to seeing this, with nobody seeming to be successful. My guess is that many of these people were or are not 6-foot-3, 225 pounds, and also didn’t really know the exact point of weakness. How much force was applied? Enough to where my left thumb was sore for about 20 minutes after but not so much where I was shaking. I also will admit that once the indentation was made, if I took a firm grasp with both my hands and attempted to “fold” it at the weak spot, I suspect I could have made it worse. Again, why would you?  But … and this is big BIG but, I find it hard to believe this thing is going to bend under normal wear and tear. Maybe if you’re over 200 pounds and sit on it for 20 minutes it might bend, but why would you? I’d love to see the pair of pants and the person who bends this thing with it just in his or her front pocket. I dropped a Motorola flip phone once in college while getting into my car, about three feet above the asphalt. It shattered into 100 pieces. The blue screen of death haunted me on my Windows PC like a scene in a horror movie. Is it possible that our standards are getting juuuuust a bit high? To me the issues with the iPhone Plus are: You can’t one-hand it to navigate, and it does look ridiculous up to your head. I think the 4.7-inch form is ideal for a phone, that’s what I really took from my visit. That, and that nobody cares about “bendgate.”  iDont either.  FREE AppDownload
Getty/Lean In/Thomas BarwickEvery business and work group has a boss, but a much smaller number has a leader at the helm. The differences are clear — and which one your organization has will determine, in large part, what you can achieve and how you will achieve it. So if you're in charge, or if you aspire to be, you have a decision to make: Are you going to be the boss or are you going to be the leader? The choice is entirely up to you, of course — but here are some points to consider as you make up your mind. A boss drives others; a leader coaches them toward their best performance. A boss instills fear; a leader inspires enthusiasm. A boss blames others; a leader works to help repair the damage and understand what happened so it won't occur again. A boss thinks in terms of him or herself; a leader thinks in terms of we. A boss knows how it's done; a leader shows how it's done. A boss depends on his or her own authority; a leader depends, along with the entire team, on mutual accountability and trust. A boss uses people; a leader is interested in helping them grow and develop. A boss takes the credit; a leader gives credit to others. A boss you is a commander; a leader is more concerned with asking and listening. The boss says, "Go!"; the leader says, "Let's go!" When you make the choice to be a leader, there are some things you have to give up: Ego, for one. Doing it your way. Always knowing you're right. Never having your world view challenged. In exchange, though, you'll gain a few things: An atmosphere of collegiality and collaboration. A workplace that people will line up to work at. An authentic authority that comes from who you are, not what you say or do. The chance to change lives — including your own. You don't have to look very hard to see that we already have plenty of bosses in the world. What we're lacking is great leaders. Are you ready to choose? FREE AppDownload

Thomson ReutersAn electricity pylon is seen above a solar power plant which is under construction on a hill in WuhuLONDON (Reuters) - Solar energy could be the top source of electricity by 2050, aided by plummeting costs of the equipment to generate it, a report from the International Energy Agency (IEA), the West's energy watchdog, said on Monday. IEA Reports said solar photovoltaic (PV) systems could generate up to 16 percent of the world's electricity by 2050, while solar thermal electricity (STE) - from "concentrating" solar power plants - could provide a further 11 percent. "The rapid cost decrease of photovoltaic modules and systems in the last few years has opened new perspectives for using solar energy as a major source of electricity in the coming years and decades," said IEA Executive Director Maria van der Hoeven. Solar photovoltaic (PV) panels constitute the fastest growing renewable energy technology in the world since 2000, although solar is still less than 1 percent of energy capacity worldwide. The IEA said PV expansion would be led by China, followed by the United States, while STE could also grow in the United States along with Africa, India and the Middle East.

EIAIn response to Iran’s strategic grip over oil passing through the Strait of Hormuz, a new export route for crude from the Persian Gulf is growing on the coast of the Arabian Sea, with the potential to transform global energy markets. Giant tankers now queue in lines stretching for miles to load oil or refuel at Fujairah — a sleepy sheikhdom in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) — after the government invested billions of dollars into building a giant oil pipeline across the rugged Hajar mountains, with the aim of ending the potential stranglehold that Iran could place on the nation’s exports of crude. The 21-mile-wide Hormuz channel handles a third of the world’s oil-tanker traffic and connects the Persian Gulf’s sheikhdoms to the Arabian Sea. Fears that Tehran could choke off exports shipped through it have been a concern weighing on oil markets for decades. In 2008, worries that Iran would blockade the strait helped to send oil prices skyrocketing to a record $147 per barrel, a level not achieved since. But the opening of a 240-mile long, 48in-wide export pipeline two years ago, linking the UAE’s biggest oil fields with the Arabian Sea, has alleviated these concerns and could now transform Fujairah from a quiet port used by ships to refuel into a global energy trans-shipment hub. “Fujairah is the only emirate that has significant access to the ocean, and it has been on our eye to utilise this strategic position and location as an export route,” Suhail Al-Mazrouei, minister of energy for the UAE, told The Daily Telegraph, on the sidelines of an energy forum hosted by The Gulf Intelligence. “The infrastructure that Fujairah now has today and will have in the future makes it a major city and a major destination for the energy sector.” The pipeline from Habshan in the emirate of Abu Dhabi currently carries about 800,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude — equal to Britain’s entire output from the North Sea — but has the capacity to handle up to 1.5m bpd. The advantage for oil tankers loading crude in Fujairah is that vital delivery time is saved that otherwise would be wasted sailing back and forth through the overcrowded Strait of Hormuz. Loading at Fujairah is also cheaper for tankers, which don’t have to pay the costly indemnity rates required to enter the Persian Gulf. REUTERS/Mosab Omar A UAE police boat sails past the M Star oil tanker at sea near Fujairah port in the United Arab Emirates on July 29, 2010. The logic of shifting more export capacity outside the Gulf is also catching on with other exporters in the region. Oman is planning to build a new multibillion-dollar oil export hub at Ras Markaz, about 450 miles south of the UAE. Although the sultanate already loads and stores its own crude from outside the Gulf, the Ras Markaz will provide it with enough capacity potentially to export oil from other countries in the region. In addition, the government of the UAE plans to invest billions of dollars to build the largest facilities to import liquefied natural gas (LNG) in the entire Middle East at Fujairah to help meet surging domestic demand for electricity and desalinated water. According to Mr Al-Mazrouie, Fujairah is the most strategically secure location in the emirates to build the new facilities. “We are going to import LNG and the UK is already importing LNG so that makes the people of the UAE and the UK concerned about the security of the same commodity. “It is the same when you are talking about the utilization of energy as a whole. I think energy, whether in the UK or Germany or here, is everyone’s concern. “We’re concerned on the level of consumption — we want to reduce consumption, to learn from Europe on the conservation of energy, and we are adopting new laws on the conservation of energy because of this. So when it comes to the subject of energy, I think we are all connected, like it or not,” he said. Aside from the new LNG import facilities, major projects are planned to expand its crude oil storage capacity to 12m barrels and to provide loading infrastructure for huge 330-meter-long (360-yard) class of tankers known as Very Large Crude Carriers. “The Habshan oil pipeline has given companies the confidence to invest in Fujairah for the first time,” said Capt Mousa Morad, general manager of the port of Fujairah. “We are emulating Dubai but for the sea.” Although Fujairah’s recent growth has come mainly from the new pipeline, the port has played an important role as a safe bunkering terminal ever since shipping in the Gulf was threatened during the Iran-Iraq war in the early Eighties. The presence last week of a Chinese naval flotilla reportedly visiting the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas in the Gulf for the first time is further evidence of potential future flash points. However, the strategic location of Fujairah at the gateway to the world’s biggest oilfields was even apparent as early as the Second World War. A few miles off the coast lies the wreck of a German U-boat sunk by a British bomber in 1943 on its way to the Gulf. The submarine — the only such vessel thought to have reached the Arabian Peninsula in the war — had been sent by Adolf Hitler to sink British tankers bringing vital fuel out of the region. Today, the submarine, which rests at the bottom of the Arabian Sea, is near a popular local fishing spot, but it is also a poignant reminder of Fujairah’s strategic location at the gateway to a region that lays claim to 60pc of the world’s proven oil reserves.

IPSoftIn February 2011 an artificially intelligent computer system called IBM Watson astonished audiences worldwide by beating the two all-time greatest Jeopardy champions at their own game. Thanks to its ability to apply advanced natural language processing, information retrieval, knowledge representation, automated reasoning, and machine learning technologies, Watson consistently outperformed its human opponents on the American quiz show Jeopardy. Watson represented an important milestone in the development of artificial intelligence, but the field has been progressing rapidly – particularly with regard to natural language processing and machine learning. In 2012, Google used 16,000 computer processors to build a simulated brain that could correctly identify cats in YouTube videos ; the Kinect, which provides a 3D body-motion interface for Microsoft's Xbox, uses algorithms that emerged from artificial intelligence research, as does the iPhone's Siri virtual personal assistant. Today a new artificial intelligence computing system has been unveiled, which promises to transform the global workforce. Named 'Amelia' after American aviator and pioneer Amelia Earhart, the system is able to shoulder the burden of often tedious and laborious tasks, allowing human co-workers to take on more creative roles. "Watson is perhaps the best data analytics engine that exists on the planet; it is the best search engine that exists on the planet; but IBM did not set out to create a cognitive agent. It wanted to build a program that would win Jeopardy, and it did that," said Chetan Dube, chief executive Officer of IPsoft, the company behind Amelia. "Amelia, on the other hand, started out not with the intention of winning Jeopardy, but with the pure intention of answering the question posed by Alan Turing in 1950 – can machines think?" Amelia learns by following the same written instructions as her human colleagues, but is able to absorb information in a matter of seconds. She understands the full meaning of what she reads rather than simply recognizing individual words. This involves understanding context, applying logic and inferring implications. When exposed to the same information as any new employee in a company, Amelia can quickly apply her knowledge to solve queries in a wide range of business processes. Just like any smart worker she learns from her colleagues and, by observing their work, she continually builds her knowledge. While most ‘smart machines’ require humans to adapt their behaviour in order to interact with them, Amelia is intelligent enough to interact like a human herself. She speaks more than 20 languages, and her core knowledge of a process needs only to be learned once for her to be able to communicate with customers in their language. Independently, rather than through time-intensive programming, Amelia creates her own 'process map' of the information she is given so that she can work out for herself what actions to take depending on the problem she is solving. "Intelligence is the ability to acquire and apply knowledge. If a system claims to be intelligent, it must be able to read and understand documents, and answer questions on the basis of that. It must be able to understand processes that it observes. It must be able to solve problems based on the knowledge it has acquired. And when it cannot solve a problem, it must be capable of learning the solution through noticing how a human did it," said Dube. IPsoft has been working on this technology for 15 years with the aim of developing a platform that does not simply mimic human thought processes but can comprehend the underlying meaning of what is communicated – just like a human. Just as machines transformed agriculture and manufacturing, IPsoft believes that cognitive technologies will drive the next evolution of the global workforce, so that in the future companies will have digital workforces that comprise a mixture of human and virtual employees. Amelia has already been trialled within a number of Fortune 1000 companies, in areas such as manning technology help desks, procurement processing, financial trading operations support and providing expert advice for field engineers. In each of these environments, she has learnt not only from reading existing manuals and situational context but also by observing and working with her human colleagues and discerning for herself a map of the business processes being followed. In a help desk situation, for example, Amelia can understand what a caller is looking for, ask questions to clarify the issue, find and access the required information and determine which steps to follow in order to solve the problem. As a knowledge management advisor, she can help engineers working in remote locations who are unable to carry detailed manuals, by diagnosing the cause of failed machinery and guiding them towards the best steps to rectifying the problem. During these trials, Amelia was able to go from solving very few queries independently to 42 per cent of the most common queries within one month. By the second month she could answer 64 per cent of those queries independently. "That’s a true learning cognitive agent. Learning is the key to the kingdom, because humans learn from experience. A child may need to be told five times before they learn something, but Amelia needs to be told only once," said Dube. "Amelia is that Mensa kid, who personifies a major breakthrough in cognitive technologies." Analysts at Gartner predict that, by 2017, managed services offerings that make use of autonomics and cognitive platforms like Amelia will drive a 60 per cent reduction in the cost of services, enabling organisations to apply human talent to higher level tasks requiring creativity, curiosity and innovation. IPsoft even has plans to start embedding Amelia into humanoid robots such as Softbank's Pepper, Honda's Asimoor Rethink Robotics' Baxter, allowing her to take advantage of their mechanical functions. "The robots have got a fair degree of sophistication in all the mechanical functions – the ability to climb up stairs, the ability to run, the ability to play ping pong. What they don’t have is the brain, and we’ll be supplementing that brain part with Amelia," said Dube. "I am convinced that in the next decade you’ll pass someone in the corridor and not be able to discern if it’s a human or an android." Given the premise of IPsoft's artificial intelligence system, it seems logical that the ultimate measure of Amelia's success would be passing the Turing Test – which sets out to see whether humans can discern whether they are interacting with a human or a machine. Earlier this year, a chatbot named Eugene Goostman became the first machine to pass the Turing Test by convincingly imitating a 13-year-old boy. In a five-minute keyboard conversation with a panel of human judges, Eugene managed to convince 33 per cent that it was human. Interestingly, however, IPsoft believes that the Turing Test needs reframing, to redefine what it means to 'think'. While Eugene was able to imitate natural language, he was only mimicking understanding. He did not learn from the interaction, nor did he demonstrate problem solving skills. "Natural language understanding is a big step up from parsing. Parsing is syntactic, understanding is semantic, and there’s a big cavern between the two," said Dube. "The aim of Amelia is not just to get an accolade for managing to fool one in three people on a panel. The assertion is to create something that can answer to the fundamental need of human beings – particularly after a certain age – of companionship. That is our intent."  FREE AppDownload

Thomson ReutersTraders work on the floor of the New York Stock ExchangeBy Ryan Vlastelica NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures were lower on Monday, indicating Wall Street's recent weakness would continue amid ongoing civil unrest in Hong Kong. * Equities have been volatile in recent sessions, with major indexes closing out their worst week in eight last week despite a sharp advance on Friday. Daily moves on the S&amp;P 500 have been sharply above average of late, and the benchmark index closed under its 50-day moving average one day last week. * While the S&amp;P is only 1.4 percent away from a record close hit earlier this month, many investors have expressed concerns about the recent trend in equities. The S&amp;P is below its 14-day moving average, a sign of weak near-term momentum, while the Russell 2000 is down more than 7 percent from its closing record, leading to worries that those losses could spread throughout the market. * Investors closely watched the situation in Hong Kong, where China faced one of its biggest political challenges since the Tiananmen Square massacre as hundreds of democracy protesters faced down tear gas and police baton charges. Growth in China has been a major driver of global share gains in recent years, although recent data has pointed to slowing conditions. An extended period of unrest could raise further questions about the economy's prospects. * The Hang Seng Index fell 1.9 percent, bringing its quarter-to-date losses to 6.1 percent, while an index of shares in Shanghai rose 0.4 percent. * In company news, Encana Corp said it would buy Athlon Energy Inc for $5.93 billion in cash. * New research shows Merck &amp; Co's Keytruda drug, the first in a new wave of immune-boosting medicines to be approved for treating melanomas in the United States, also has potential in stomach cancer. Futures snapshot at 6:47: * S&amp;P 500 e-minis were falling 8 points, or 0.4 percent, with 138,934 contracts changing hands. * Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 17 points, or 0.42 percent, in volume of 24,060 contracts. * Dow e-minis were down 72 points, or 0.42 percent, with 23,053 contracts changing hands.

REUTERS/StringerA staff member plays a shot towards a putting green on a lake from a tee ground on top of a hill, at Zhangjiajie, Hunan province.The month and the quarter end on Tuesday, which means we've got lots economic data coming. This week comes reports on US home prices, auto sales, manufacturing and jobs. We'll also get monthly manufacturing reports from around the world. Economists expect the reports to reflect an ongoing divergence in the world: the US growing at a healthy clip, Europe and Japan stumbling, and the emerging markets decelerating rapidly. In its new monthly economic report, Citi Research analysts cut their forecast for 2015 global GDP growth to 3.3%, and their adjustments reflect the divergence theme. "We make notable downgrades this month to 2014-15 growth forecasts for Argentina, Brazil, China, Denmark, Japan, Romania, Russia, South Africa and Switzerland, partly balanced by a 0.2 percent upgrade to our 2014 US growth forecast (to 2.3% from 2.1% last month)," Citi's Michael Saunders wrote Wednesday. "In all, we are cutting our EM growth forecast by 0.2 percent for 2014 and by 0.3 percent for 2015 — and this is the biggest monthly downgrade to our overall forecast for EM GDP growth in the current year and next year since mid-2011." We'll probably continue to hear a lot about this asynchronous global recovery, especially as the world's central banks take monetary policy in different directions. Here's your Monday Scouting Report: Top Stories Economic Calendar Market Commentary Wall Street's equity strategists have been offering guidance on how to invest in advance of the Federal Reserve's first rate hike. However, they stress that moves in the stock market are much more about other macro factors. Here's Deutsche Bank's David Bianco: "Stocks typically sell-off on the first of a series of rate hikes, but the magnitude and duration of the sell-off depend on conditions. During early cycle hikes the initial sell-off was generally small, quickly recovered and further S&amp;P gains came in next three months and longer (like 2004, 1983, 1972). But many sell- offs on late cycle hikes became corrections or even bear markets. Determining whether it’s early or late in the cycle is subjective, but the shape of the curve, inflation measures, years since the last recession can help. Next year is likely another mid-cycle year and we don’t expect a severe S&amp;P reaction to hikes, but the risk is the Fed hikes too late or too little and inflation accelerates requiring the Fed to hike to levels higher than expected." Here's Fundstrat Global Advisors' Tom Lee: "Analysis of 14 rates cycles since 1954 argues that markets typically respond to variations in underlying economic conditions and not to the Fed rate hike itself. While market behavior is overall pretty consistent across the cycles prior to a hike (up 79% of the time), post-hike we saw surprising divergences of market and sector behavior due to the underlying growth, inflation, and investment conditions that prevailed at the time. The bottom line...nearly best-case conditions for stocks today. To cut to the chase, conditions today are almost optimal (low growth/low inflation/low investment) and suggest a significantly better performing stock market in the upcoming tightening cycle. In other words, do not despair." For more insight about the middle market, visit mid-marketpulse.com. FREE AppDownload
DreamWorks Animation(Reuters) - Japan's SoftBank is in talks to acquire DreamWorks Animation SKG in a deal that valued DreamWorks at as much as $3.4 billion, media reported on Sunday. A SoftBank spokesman said the company had no comment. The acquisition talks were reported by The Hollywood Reporter, Variety and The Wall Street Journal. The Hollywood Reporter quoted an unidentified source with knowledge of the deal as saying an acquisition would value DreamWorks at $3.4 billion. That would value DreamWorks Animation at $32 per share. The stock closed at $22.36 on Friday.

Thomson ReutersA man walks past a branch of Lloyds bank in central LondonLONDON (Reuters) - Lloyds Banking Group said on Monday it had dismissed eight staff following an investigation into the submission of benchmark interest rates after it was fined in July by American and British regulators. Lloyds, which is 25 percent owned by the British government, said around 3 million pounds ($4.9 million) in unpaid bonuses had been forfeited as a result of the action. The bank was fined $370 million in July for its part in the attempted manipulation of the London interbank offered rate (Libor) and for attempting to fix so-called "repo" rates to reduce fees for a taxpayer-backed scheme set up by the Bank of England to support British banks during the financial crisis. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has said the attempted manipulation could lead to criminal action against those involved. Lloyds said it had undertaken disciplinary action immediately after the settlements were announced. It said it was unable to take disciplinary action against a number of individuals who had already left the group prior to the settlements. However, the bank passed on its findings to Britain's Financial Conduct Authority and other regulators. "Having now taken disciplinary action against those individuals responsible for the totally unacceptable behavior identified by the regulators' investigations, the board and the group's management team are committed to preventing this type of behavior happening again," Lloyds Chief Executive Antonio Horta-Osorio said in a statement.

REUTERS/Phil McCartenMohamed El-ErianDays after Bill Gross' sudden departure from PIMCO, the firm's new management spoke with Reuters' Jennifer Ablan. One quote really stood out. "You will see a lot less self promotion," said Scott Mather, the new CIO of US core strategies. "And you're going to see a lot more emphasis on performance. It will be a lot more 'We' and a lot less 'I.'" In principle, this is cookie-cutter teamwork talk. But the wording is striking. And it sounds a whole lot like something we read in January. "But the significance of the 'I' pales when compared to the 'we' and 'you.'" That sentence came from the memo that then co-CIO Mohamed El-Erian circulated to PIMCO employees when he resigned in January. Those three quoted words were the only three words that were bold, underlined and italicized in El-Erian's lengthy 4-page, single-spaced memo. Here's the relevant excerpt: I was so fortunate back in April 1999 to join such an exceptional firm. I vividly remember how I immediately felt at home in a culture that always puts the client first, that is determined to excel, and that values thought leadership as a foundation for continued success. During my wonderful time at PIMCO, I worked with amazing colleagues who taught and inspired me. I grew professionally and personally. I made lasting friendships. And I had great fun. But the significance of the “I” pales when compared to the “we” and “you.” Collectively as a firm, we have achieved amazing things for our clients around the world. It is hard to believe when you see today’s PIMCO but, back then, I joined in 1999 a firm that had some $150 billion in assets under management, serving essentially US clients. We offered primarily core fixed income U.S. products. And we were around 500 colleagues working in 4 offices. Today we are around 2,500 in 13 offices around the world. Our truly global client base has entrusted us with some $2 trillion in assets to manage. And we provide them with a much more diversified set of investment products whose performance continues to excel – once again, over 90 percent of our assets under management are out-performing their benchmarks for the last 5-year period (as of December 31, 2013, before fees). Yes, collectively, we have been on a meaningful and amazing journey – of serving well more clients, in more places, and with an expanding set of investment solutions to help them meet their objectives. As you can imagine, the last six years have been particularly exciting and significant as we have helped our clients navigate a global financial crisis and its aftermath. Together, we have worked very hard to safeguard and grow their retirement funds, pensions, investments and savings. And because PIMCO delivered, they have rewarded the firm’s hard and effective work by almost tripling our assets under management during this six year period. Or, from another perspective, it took PIMCO 39 years to reach the first $1 trillion mark and just over 3 years to reach the $2 trillion mark. It has been a period of amazing growth in other meaningful ways too. We are a much stronger and more diversified firm. Our increasing revenues achieved yet another new record in 2013, as did the level of PIMCO’s profits. Our assets under management are more diversified with the share of non-traditional (non-core fixed income) assets, which stood at 56 percent of our business in December 2007 when I rejoined as CEO and co-CIO, now at 66 percent – and this is despite that fact that PIMCO’s traditional business continued to grow strongly over this period. We are also a much more global firm, and getting more so by the day. In the last six years alone, the share of our non-US business has risen to over 30 percent, and again notwithstanding solid growth in our U.S.-based business. Together, we have done more than successfully expand and diversify PIMCO – we have also successfully grown and made significant strides in diversifying our people. Our expanding Inclusion and Diversity programs have become an integral part of our talent management and, already, are an important contributor to our success. That, together with our closely-related collective emphasis on promoting and engendering cognitive diversity, puts PIMCO in an even better position to deliver more for our clients in the future. Because of the way we have done all this – namely, by never losing sight of our mission to deliver to clients superior long-term investment performance, world class client servicing, innovative products, and the right mix of business resilience and agility – PIMCO’s success has been recognized worldwide; and not just by the multiple awards (including last week’s Morningstar award for Alfred Murata and Dan Ivascyn, joining Bill Gross and Mark Kiesel as past winners) but also, most importantly, by the very high level of client satisfaction. You are extremely talented, dedicated, and hard working in serving clients. You provide a level of investment excellence, intellectual stimulation and operational efficiency that also allow others to grow and shine. You interact in a way that make the whole much bigger than the sum of the parts. You find a way to maintain your composure and effectiveness regardless of the volatility of markets. And, somehow, you do all this again and again! What is really impressive about you is not limited to what you consistently deliver to our clients and how you do so; it is also about how you find the time and energy to also give back to our local communities... In an interview published last week, El-Erian told Reuters' Ablan that he has "no interaction" with PIMCO in his current role as chief economic adviser for Allianz. While that may be true, Mather's quote is proof that the spirit of El-Erian is very much present at PIMCO today. FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Eduardo MunozThe Italian tax authorities are investigating Miuccia Prada and Patrizio Bertelli, joint chief executives at Prada, for tax avoidance. That’s according to a company statement this morning.  The company insists that it is not involved directly in the matter. The investigation relates to the “accuracy of certain past tax filings by them as individuals in respect of foreign owned companies”  The release says the husband and wife executive team made a “voluntary disclosure” to the tax authority in December last year, even though they officially denied the existence of any investigation in January this year, as reported by Reuters, which cited three sources saying Milan prosecutors were looking into the Prada family.  Prada shares dropped 0.83% during the day – the company is listed in Hong Kong, so the announcement came after trading closed. But the combination of Hong Kong’s enormous democracy protests and worries over the company’s leadership might mean some ugly days ahead for the company. Italy, like most other cash-strapped countries, has made more of an effort on tax avoidance since the 2008 financial crisis. In the past, that's included just stopping people in expensive cars to work out how much they earn.  FREE AppDownload

REUTERS/Jim YoungBill Gross Bill Gross' sudden resignation as CIO of PIMCO was followed by a sharp sell-off in shares of Allianz, the parent of the Newport Beach-based $2 trillion asset manager. Allianz fell 6% on Friday. Janus Capital, Gross' new employer, saw shares surge 42%. The big concern is that clients will pull their money out of PIMCO. "Allianz share price reaction discounts about $400 billion of outflows from PIMCO, we believe," Morgan Stanley's Jon Hocking and Xinmeng Wang wrote on Monday. "This is around 20% of PIMCO's total AUM — our calculation simplistically assumes that the unit's margins do not alter at the reduced level of assets." According to The Wall Street Journal, PIMCO has already seen $10 billion of withdrawals. While uncertainty lingers and is certainly discounted into the price, Hocking and Wang believe management "transition plans are well developed." Indeed, Allianz announced PIMCO's new management team only hours after Gross' departure. The other big question is how much of those outflows will flow into Janus. "Our US asset management analysts believe that the jump in Janus' share price on Friday implies the capture of only around $20-30bn of AUM," the analysts wrote. "They estimate that while Bill Gross directly managed around $300bn of AUM, he had influence over a total of $500bn (although one could argue for a higher number here). We note that when leading UK income manager Neil Woodford left Invesco Perpetual he subsequently attracted around 12% of the original AUM." Allianz shares are up 0.7% in Monday trading.

Thomson ReutersFile photo of  mock tank displayed by local artists at a shopping district in Hong KongHONG KONG (Reuters) - Increasing civil unrest in Hong Kong is scaring off Chinese tourists, heaping further pressure on retailers which are already grappling with a protracted slowdown in sales. Central Hong Kong descended into chaos on Sunday as pro-democracy protesters converged on barricades as hundreds of police cordoned off streets and walkways and tensions flared amid the arrest of several lawmakers. Police used tear gas to disperse demonstrators. With mainland Chinese travelers likely to avoid Hong Kong over the long National Day holidays this week due to planned protests in the city, the downtrend in retail sales in the former British colony is set to extend beyond its six-month slide. Already hurt by Beijing's anti-corruption campaign, which has led Chinese visitors to tighten lavish spending in the city renowned as a shoppers' paradise, Hong Kong businesses are also facing a slide in the number of tour groups. Added to which, those who traipse across the border each day are now more interested in basic household products and infant milk formula than luxury handbags and high-end fashion, data shows. Travel agents said the number of Chinese tours has dropped by up to 30 percent, boding ill for the busy Golden Week holiday that starts on Oct. 1, usually a busy period that retailers rely on for a boost to their sales. Hong Kong activists are expected to lock down the heart of the financial center on Wednesday, part of a civil disobedience movement that some fear will hurt the city's competitiveness and business environment. At the heart of their demands is the right for Hong Kong people to choose the city's next leader, rather than a leader pre-selected by Beijing. Demonstrators are demanding democracy in a series of protests that will culminate in an "Occupy Central" blockade of the financial district on Oct. 1, the start of China's long holiday. "For overseas tourists, they don't understand much about Occupy Central, but they are concerned if there will be any riots or large-scale rally, and they worry about the refund policy if there is unrest," said Paul Leung, chairman of The Hong Kong Inbound Travel Association, referring to refunds on tours. It was not surprising to see a 20-30 percent drop in the number of Chinese tours, he said, adding that the size of the groups had also dropped to 20 to 30 people from about 40 in the past. China's slowing economic growth has been a negative factor for luxury goods makers and Hong Kong retail-related stocks have been sold off lately on weak consumer sentiment and uncertainties due to the civil unrest. Prada SpA's &lt;1913.HK&gt; Hong Kong-listed shares have fallen to their lowest level in 26 months. "We are concerned about the development," said a spokeswoman from cosmetics chain Sa Sa International &lt;0178.HK&gt;. "Sa Sa is closely monitoring the event and will adopt contingency measures when appropriate." "Social, political tension is clearly driving a few people away because obviously you have a lot of different options. If you're a wealthy Chinese individual, the likelihood is that you've been to Hong Kong two or three times already and you'll have more welcoming places to go to," said Erwan Rambourg, who researches luxury and sporting goods research at HSBC. South Korea and Japan were among the top options, he said. Hong Kong's retail sector relies heavily on mainland Chinese visitors, who contributed around one-third of the city's retail sales in 2013, according to Credit Suisse. Prospects are not looking up yet, as demand for luxury goods continues to slide while spending by locals remains sluggish. The Retail Management Association has revised the city's 2014 retail sales growth to 5 percent from 12 percent, while Hang Seng Bank trimmed its forecast to 5 percent from 13 percent. Retail sale in terms of value rose 11 percent in 2013. Hong Kong retail sales for August are due on Sept. 29. But some retailers in the Central business district and shoppers are not too worried about the impact of protests. "If our shops in Central are affected, we will consider shortening operation hours as a measure to ensure the safety of our staff and customers and to avoid losses to the shops," a company spokeswoman from Chow Tai Fook Jewellery &lt;1929.HK&gt; said. "We, however, believe there will not be much negative impact on our business as customers can go to our shops in other locations." A Chinese visitor in her late 20s, surnamed Zhang, who was shopping downtown where students had boycotted classes to protest, said she would be shopping as usual. "There are a lot of shopping malls in Hong Kong; we can just go elsewhere." (Additional reporting by Kinling Lo and Twinnie Siu; Editing by Anne Marie Roantree and Jacqueline Wong) FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersChy Sila, CEO of CBM Corporation, holds his mobile phone while driving a car in Phnom PenhPHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Chy Sila has come a long way since he invested his $500 life savings in a small shop in Cambodia's capital to sell bootleg music and pirated movies. Fast-forward 16 years and Cambodians are now watching the films he distributes not on scratchy DVDs but in a $5 million multiplex theater, a joint venture with Thailand's Major Cineplex and the centerpiece of a new mall owned by Japanese retail giant Aeon that drew 2 million visitors in its opening month. The 39-year-old former tour guide, university dropout and son of a mechanic is one of the biggest success stories in a country that was for years Southeast Asia's war-torn, aid-dependant basket case. Though poverty is still rife in the countryside, an urban boom and robust growth fueled by garment manufacturing for brands such as Nike &lt;nke.n&gt; and GAP &lt;gps.n&gt; has given rise to a growing consumer class that earns triple the average income. "We see there's a lot more buying power than before," said Chy Sila as he took a bite from a croissant and sipped cappuccino at one of the bakeries run by his CBM Corporation, Cambodia's biggest food and beverage firm. "People can afford to pay so now's the time, we're ready for big brands to come here... Materialism is in peoples' hearts, what you wear, what you drive, represents what you are." With a fast-growing working population and falling dependency ratio, Cambodia has the demographics most favorable to rapid economic growth. Young Cambodians now buy smartphones, flat-screen TVs and Japanese motorcycles. They tap banks for loans and credit cards and are fuelling the kind of capitalist culture the 1970s ultra-Maoist Khmer Rouge killed 2 million people to prevent. Aeon plans more malls in Cambodian cities and operates a microfinance firm so shoppers can buy on payment plans. Its new mall, boasting shops from the likes of Mango, Levi's and Versace, drew 100,000 visitors daily when it opened in June. "The middle class is growing," said Aeon spokesman Satoshi Otsuka. "The average age for Cambodians is early 20s and they're fashion-conscious." Chy Sila was born the same year the Khmer Rouge swept to power and says he lost "countless" relatives to Pol Pot's genocidal pursuit for a peasant utopia. Today's capitalist Cambodia, with an economy that averaged 8.1 percent growth from 2000-2012 and expanded 7.4 percent last year, according to the World Bank, is a far cry from what the Khmer Rouge envisioned when it abolished money and property ownership, executed entrepreneurs and blew up the central bank. Forty years after the population of Phnom Penh were emptied into labor camps, the city is swelling, with malls, office towers, hotels and fast-food chains popping up rapidly. Modern SUVs, and even the occasional Lamborghini or Porsche, cruise its once potholed streets. The World Bank says the country of 15 million people is a top global performer in tackling poverty, having cut the ratio of poor from 53 percent of its population in 2004 to 20 percent in 2011. Foreign direct investment has grown, from $2.65 billion recorded in 2007 to as high as $10.8 billion in subsequent years, according to Cambodia's investment board. There's now a small stock market and the number of banks has nearly doubled since a decade ago, with 35 commercial lenders providing $9.5 billion in loans since records started. Cambodia's Credit Bureau expects that to surpass $14 billion by 2020 and credit demand to almost double to 3.3 million people. The average bank loan in 2004 was $3,895, about a fifth of last year's average of $19,096, according to Acleda Bank, Cambodia's biggest lender. "Loans are good for young people like me," said Hour Veasna, 20, as he signed up for financing from Aeon to buy a $600 camera, equivalent to five months salary. "We don't have enough money to purchase things that we want."  In the first half of 2014, bank deposits grew 13 percent and loans to the private sector were up 28 percent, central bank Governor Chea Chanto said in a recent speech. Three million Cambodians use banks to deposit money, up 18 percent from last year, with about 600,000 users of credit or debit cards. But there are still plenty of Cambodians who don't have such privileges and Chy Sila says he's saddened by the yawning gap between rich and poor. He raises money to send children to school and has cultivated an image as a humble entrepreneur, driving a Ford SUV rather than luxury cars such as Rolls-Royce, which entered the local market in June. The new-found opulence of Phnom Penh can leave a sour taste in the mouths of those who struggle to get basic services in Cambodia, where hospitals are overwhelmed and average annual income is $950 - or $2.60 a day - nearly half that of Vietnam and a fifth of Thailand. "Economic growth is only for the city," said rice farmer Heang Samnang, waiting with her sick daughter at the city's foreign-funded Kantha Bopha Hospital, which provides free treatment to millions of poor. "In rural areas, there's no development, we just work on farms."  (Additional reporting by Ritsuko Shimizuin Tokyo; Editing by Martin Petty and Alex Richardson) FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersThe AIG headquarters offices are seen in New York's financial districtWASHINGTON (Reuters) - One of the more unusual trials to come out of the 2008 financial crisis is set to begin on Monday, when a federal judge will consider whether the U.S. government's rescue of American International Group Inc &lt;aig.n&gt; was, in fact, legal. In a case that explores the limits on U.S. government power in responding to major financial crises, the trial is expected to revisit in detail the New York Federal Reserve's September 2008 decision to extend a bailout package to AIG as the insurance giant was minutes from bankruptcy. The AIG bailout, on the heels of the Lehman Brothers collapse in 2008, preceded the "too big to fail" auto and bank bailouts the federal government undertook during a U.S. financial crisis underpinned by faulty mortgage lending. The major players in that drama will be back on the Washington stage during the six-week trial: Former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, and former Treasury Secretaries Timothy Geithner and Henry "Hank" Paulson. A lawyer for the insurance giant's former chief executive, Maurice "Hank" Greenberg, was expected to argue that the government unlawfully sought to punish AIG shareholders with excessively harsh terms. REUTERS/Hyungwon KangHenry Paulson looks over Ben Bernanke and Tim Geithner.Greenberg's lawyers have said in court papers the bailout "offer" from the New York Fed to provide AIG an $85 billion loan in exchange for high interest rates and a nearly 80 percent stake in the company amounted to unconstitutional theft from AIG shareholders. Greenberg, through his Starr International Co, was AIG's largest shareholder at the time. Starr filed lawsuit, to considerable public scorn, in November 2011. Government lawyers have defended the actions as appropriate, pointing out that the deal had been approved by the AIG board, as the company faced no other alternative to bankruptcy. Lawyers at the U.S. Department of Justice have described the case as a "conspiracy theory" and "built on a mistaken premise." "Starr's case stems from a misperceived entitlement ... that when AIG faced an existential crisis in September 2008, AIG was entitled to dictate the terms of its own rescue," they said in papers filed before trial. But U.S. Judge Thomas Wheeler last month rejected the United States' bid to dismiss the lawsuit, which seeks as much $50 billion in damages, saying that the case involved "complex financial and economic issues" that deserved analysis. The case poses two central questions. One is whether it was legal for the government to take $35 billion worth in AIG shares, and only effectively pay $500,000. The 5th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution prevents private property from being taken for public use without just compensation. The other is whether the government was allowed to condition its first $85 billion loan on an equity stake in the company. Starr's lawyers have argued that the Federal Reserve Act does not allow the government to demand a stake in the company in exchange for the loan. AIG finished repaying the full $182.3 billion bailout in December 2012, leaving taxpayers with a nearly $23 billion profit. Greenberg, 89, led AIG for nearly four decades before his 2005 ouster. Arguing for Starr is David Boies, who represented former Vice President Al Gore before the U.S. Supreme Court during the contested 2000 presidential election. Few experts even expected the case to go to trial. "Certainly what the government did was unusual ... my guess is that the government will win," said Hester Peirce, a senior research fellow at George Mason University who studies financial regulation. "The standard idea is that during a crisis, what the government should do is lend freely, but they should do so at a penalty rate," Peirce said.   (Reporting by Aruna Viswanatha; Editing by Doina Chiacu and Andrea Ricci) FREE AppDownload

REUTERS/Jim YoungBill Gross, co-founder and co-chief investment officer of Pacific Investment Management Company (PIMCO), speaks at the Morningstar Investment Conference in Chicago, Illinois, June 19, 2014.(Reuters) - Pimco is moving away from a founder-led model and the $2 trillion asset manager's flagship fund, formerly run by co-founder Bill Gross "does not define Pimco," CEO Doug Hodge said on Sunday.  "Over the last five years, we have expanded into far more parts of the fixed income market and into other asset classes and other geographies, so the Pimco Total Return Fund does not define Pimco," Hodge said. "It's an important flagship product of this firm but it is not our only strategy."    Hodge and Dan Ivascyn, who takes over for Gross at the Newport Beach, California-based firm as group chief investment officer, told Reuters in an interview that they have been speaking to clients all weekend about the new leadership. Pimco is a unit of Munich-based Allianz. "With regard to our clients and the potential for outflows, again, when there is any significant change, we are out communicating with our clients and we are talking with them and we are explaining the changes that are going on," Hodge said. "The outflows that have happened ‚Äì and that may happen ‚Äì we stand by our clients. We are managing assets and are confident that the vast majority of clients will stand with us." On Friday, Gross shocked the investment world by leaving his post as chief investment officer to join mutual fund management firm Janus Capital. The move followed record outflows from Pimco's flagship portfolio and clashes with other top executives. Bill Gross was not available for comment. Sue Gross, Bill's wife, said on Sunday she and Bill were "doing good."  Gross's exit, eight months after his top deputy Mohamed El-Erian quit amid acrimony, may quicken speculation in the bond market about leadership uncertainties and accelerating outflow at the world's largest bond firm. Since the start of the year, investors have pulled $25 billion from the Pimco Total Return Fund, the world's largest bond fund, and $6 billion from the Pimco Unconstrained Bond Fund, according to Morningstar data as of the end of August. Both were personally supervised by Gross, 70, who also oversaw the Pimco Total Return ETF, the object of the SEC probe.              ALLIANZ HEADQUARTERS El-Erian will be at Allianz headquarters in the coming week or so, according to two people familiar with the situation, adding the meeting had been planned several months ago and unrelated to Gross's departure. El-Erian declined to comment. When asked if El-Erian could play a role at the firm in the future, Hodge said on Sunday: "We made some very clear decisions about the leadership of this firm with regard to Dan (Ivascyn) as our group CIO and the team of investors and leaders we have in place." Ivascyn, whose $50 billion Pimco Income fund is posting returns of 7.81 percent year-to-date as of August 31, easily surpassing the 4.81 percent on the benchmark Barclays Aggregate for the same time period, won't be overseeing the Total Return Fund. Mark Kiesel, Scott Mather and Mihir Worah will be portfolio managers for the $222 billion Total Return fund, where Gross built his reputation as the "Bond King." "You will see a lot less self promotion," Mather said about the post-Gross environment. "And you're going to see a lot more emphasis on performance. It will be a lot more 'We' and a lot less 'I.'"                 (Reporting by Jennifer Ablan, editing by John Pickering) FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Edgar Su HONG KONG (Reuters) - Standard Chartered Plc &lt;stan.l&gt; has suspended some of its Hong Kong banking operations, including over-the-counter services and check deposits, until further notice due to "situations in certain areas", the Asia-focused lender said on Monday. Standard Chartered has activated contingency plans to ensure continuous services to customers, the bank said in a statement. It said services including ATMs and cash deposits machines will be temporarily suspended in branches in Causeway Bay on Hong Kong island and Nathan Road in Kowloon. Some Hong Kong financial firms advised staff to work from home on Monday or go to secondary offices after thousands of pro-democracy demonstrators blocked parts of the city and clashed with police. Hong Kong police fired volleys of tear gas on Sunday to try to disperse protesters who have launched what they term a "new era" of civil disobedience to pressure Beijing into granting full democracy for the former British colony.   (Reporting by Denny Thomas and Umesh Desai; Editing by Paul Tait) FREE AppDownload

The Hong Kong-listed company said in a statement it had been informed by the Italian Judicial Authority of the probe. It said neither it nor any of its subsidiaries was or is involved in this matter. Reuters reported in January that Miuccia Prada and Bertelli were under investigation as part of a tax avoidance probe by Milan prosecutors. At the time, the company said it was not aware of investigations taking place. On Monday, the company said that Miuccia Prada and her husband had made a voluntary disclosure to Italy's tax authority in December last year, prompting an examination into certain past tax filings by the couple with respect to foreign owned companies. Representatives for Miuccia Prada and Bertelli were not immediately available outside European business hours.  (Reporting by Brenda Goh; Editing by Miral Fahmy) FREE AppDownload

Thomson ReutersThe logo of Swiss bank UBS is seen at the entrance of an office building in ZurichZURICH (Reuters) - UBS said on Monday it was launching a share-for-share exchange to set up a new holding company, UBS Group AG, part of a restructuring drive to ensure it can be broken up more easily in a crisis. The Swiss bank said in a statement it expected to propose a supplementary capital return of at least 0.25 francs a share once it had completed the transaction. The payout will likely be in 2015, based on the current timetable. Switzerland's largest lender said back in May it planned to break with its existing structure in which a parent company holds a host of interconnected branches, in order to satisfy regulators' demands for separate legal entities in different regions.

The closing purchase price is lower than the $2.3 billion valuation announced in January because of a change in the valuation of inventory and deferred revenue liability, Lenovo said.
