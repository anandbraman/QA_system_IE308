Thomson ReutersA Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 plane is seen from the departure hall at the Hong Kong International AirportKUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia is considering tapping one of its top economic policymakers to lead an overhaul of Malaysia Airlines that aims to transform the troubled carrier into a "premium airline", a newspaper reported on Wednesday. Idris Jala, who heads the government's Economic Transformation Program, previously led the national airline from 2005 to 2009. He steered the firm from heavy losses to record profits through hefty cost cutting, though critics have said it was an unsustainable long-term model. Malaysia Airlines, whose business has been devastated by the unexplained disappearance of Flight MH370 and the shooting down of Flight MH17 over Ukraine, is set to be taken private by state fund and majority shareholder Khazanah Nasional [KHAZA.UL]. Other candidates being considered for the top job include Jamaludin Ibrahim, the chief executive of state-controlled telecoms firm Axiata, the Edge Financial Daily said, citing unidentified sources. The report also cited an industry source as saying the airline would be remodeled as a "premium airline" from a full-service airline, with cuts to its domestic and international routes. Jala has headed the government's Performance Management and Delivery Unit since 2009, spearheading a $444 billion government effort to lift private investment and achieve developed nation status by 2020. An official in Jala's office said he was not aware of the report. The loss-making carrier, currently led by Chief Executive Ahmad Jauhari Yayha, said on Tuesday it has postponed publication of second-quarter earnings from Wednesday until Aug. 28, likely its last set of earnings as a listed company. It is also preparing a restructuring package, which is expected to be announced by the end of August.   (Reporting by Stuart Grudgings; Editing by Edwina Gibbs) FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersMitsubishi Motors Corp's the i-MiEV electric vehicles are reflected on an external wall in TokyoBEIJING (Reuters) - China's anti-monopoly regulator said on Wednesday it has ordered 12 Japanese auto part and bearings makers to pay fines totaling 1.24 billion yuan ($201.80 million) for manipulating prices. Sumitomo Electric Industries Ltd, Denso Corp and Mitsubishi Electric Corp are among the autoparts makers that were fined after the National Development Reform Commission (NDRC) found they had colluded to reduce competition and establish favorable pricing on their products. The price-fixing agreements were in violation of China's anti-monopoly law and "improperly affected the pricing for auto parts, entire vehicles and bearings," the NDRC said in a statement on its website. NSK Ltd, NTN Corp, and Jtekt Corp were among the four bearings companies fined by the regulator. Hitachi Automotive, a subsidiary of Hitachi Ltd, along with bearings firm Nachi-Fujikoshi Corp were not fined since they were the first firms to report the monopoly agreements and provide evidence to the regulator, the NDRC said. The regulators' ruling comes as China intensifies efforts to bring companies into compliance with an anti-monopoly law enacted in 2008. The auto sector has been under particular scrutiny amid accusations by state media that global car makers are overcharging customers.

Thomson ReutersA Sinopec logo is seen on top of a logo of Easy Joy store at a gas station in BeijingBy Denny Thomas and Heng Xie HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - Canadian retailer Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc and China's Tencent Holdings Ltd are among suitors short-listed to buy a $16 billion minority stake in China's Sinopec Sales, the world's largest fuel retail network, people familiar with the matter told Reuters. China Life Insurance Co Ltd, the nation's biggest insurer, Hong Kong-listed ENN Energy Holdings Ltd, privately-owned Fosun Group, Hopu Investment Management and Affinity Equity Partners have also progressed to the next round, said the people who declined to be identified as the sale process is confidential. Formally known as China Petroleum &amp; Chemical Corp, state-run Sinopec plans to sell up to 30 percent of Sinopec Sales by end-2014 as Beijing restructures government-owned assets. Sinopec Sales booked a net profit of 25.1 billion yuan ($4.1 billion) in 2013 from over 30,000 service stations and more than 23,000 convenience stores. While a deal would give investors little control over the company, a likely exit through an initial public offering planned within three years has attracted a wide range of suitors, the people said. The company also wants to boost non-fuel sales and is seeking investors to get into businesses such as car services, telematics, online-to-offline sales, financial services and advertising, the sources added. Sinopec Sales generated 1.49 trillion yuan in revenue in 2013, but contribution of non-fuel sales was less than 1 percent of the total. In the United States, for example, non-fuel retail sales accounts for about half the profit for gas stations. Sinopec, ENN, Affinity, Tencent, China Life and Fosun all declined to comment about the bidding process. In a statement, Couche-Tard said it had no plan to invest in Sinopec "at this time". The company Toronto-listed shares closed up 1.4 percent after rising by more than 3 percent during the session. New Hope and did not reply to emails seeking response. Hopu could not be reached for an immediate comment. Final bids are due by end-August, though it was not clear how many shortlisted bidders are likely to make offers. Couche-Tard and ENN are both bidding solo, as is privately owned Chinese investment company New Hope Group, the people said. Local companies, however, are likely to be given priority as per the government policy to share the "dividend" of China's economic growth, Sinopec chairman Fu Chengyu has said. Financial investors, like Affinity, Hopu and China Life would be interested in Sinopec Sales because of its stable yields, which Barclays estimates between 3-4 percent. Couche-Tard, which operates more than 6,000 convenience stores throughout North America, also runs about 4,200 stores under the Circle K brand in China, Japan, Mexico, Vietnam and other countries. Tencent Holding is China's largest listed Internet company and a successful deal will give it access to Sinopec's fuel payments network. BIG DEAL The planned divestment comes at a time when Sinopec's domestic fuel sales growth rate has slowed due to falling demand. Gross margins shrank to 2.3 percent in 2013 from 3.3 percent in 2011 and Barclays said in a report that a $1 fall in fuel margin from the current high level of $15-16 per barrel could lower Sinopec Sales net profit by 16 percent. The sale is expected to generate between $16-20 billion for Sinopec, money which Asia's biggest refiner may use to pay down some of its debt and to reinforce upstream investments. If successful, the sale would mark Asia's second-biggest M&amp;A trade this year, after CITIC Pacific's $36 billion purchase of its parent CITIC Group's assets. The deal is set to value Sinopec Sales at between $53-66 billion, giving it a price-to-earnings multiple of 13-16.3, according to Reuters calculations. Sinopec unveiled plans in February to restructure the business, which also includes oil-products pipelines and storage facilities across China. Advising Sinopec on the sale are China International Capital Corp, Deutsche Bank, CITIC Securities Ltd and Bank of America.

Good morning! Let’s get started… 1. Markets are rallying around the world. The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 both gained 0.5%, while the Nasdaq was up 0.4% in the US session, helped along by a big surge in housing startsand inflation coming in dead in line with expectations. It’s follows another day of gains in Asia yesterday, with the Nikkei up 0.8%, the Hang Seng up 0.7% and Shanghai up 0.3%, as global markets shrug off some of the geopolitical concerns that flicked the switch to risk-off last week. 2. The exception today could be Australia, because the market didn’t like the BHP results released after the close. Although profit was a beat on expectations, there was no stock buyback. The company also announced its plans for spinning out some of the more complex parts of its business into a new company, as expected. Investors marked the Big Australian down 5% in London and because it makes up such a big portion of the Australian bourse, ASX futures are down slightly ahead of the start of today’s session. The market will be looking to the banks to carry the load today, but we also get results from some heavyweights including Fortescue, Wesfarmers and Woodside. 3. Buying the dip. Jeff Saut of US financial house Raymond James outlines the simple strategy pro traders are using to make money at the moment. When stocks fall, you buy – and they have been continually returning to make new highs over the last couple of years. 4. ISIS beheaded an American photojournalist. In a horrifying development, ISIS has released a video purportedly showing the beheading of James Foley of the Global Post, who went missing in Syria in 2012. The executioner had a British accent. 5. The Clive Palmer crisis. When senior Australian politicians are knocking on the door of the Chinese embassy to apologise for someone’s behaviour, it’s time to move them into the “national liability” column. Referring to the Chinese as “bastards” on national TV was bad enough and Palmer’s excuse that it was about the company he’s been dealing with (government-owned, of course) simply doesn’t wash. Jacqui Lambie’s calls yesterday for a doubling of defence spending to prevent an impending Chinese military invasion show that the Palmer United Party is not only reckless but stupid. And a reminder: the PUP is not popular – it has a few pockets of support in Queensland but only hold a few points in the primary vote nationally. Unfortunately, none of this changes Palmer’s hold on the balance of power in the Senate. 6. This might be our best look yet at the iPhone 6. If they’re real, it’s the first time we’ve seen the phone with all its parts assembled. More pictures here. 7. Google AdSense danger. Idris Sami had an app that allowed people to text their friends for free. It was running Google Ads and he was doing OK. Then one day he got an email saying he was in violation of Google’s AdSense policies – and the $46,000 that was in his account was all returned to advertisers. Similar incidents have led to lawsuits against Google in the US. But it’s a cautionary tale: you need to do AdSense by the book. 8. The Pope gives himself three years, tops. Since assuming the papacy lst year, the former Argentinian nightclub bouncer has been a wildly popular Pope, eschewing the traditional wealthy trappings and digs, sticking up for homosexuals (a bit) and publicly exorcising demons. Now he’s thinks he’ll be dead in “two to three years” and says he’ll abdicate rather than continue unfit for duty. He also admitted he hadn’t had a holiday out of Argentina since 1975. 9. The Australian flag might be about to change. And we might not even have a say in it, which is ironic given the various attempts we’ve had to force the issues ourselves. If Scotland votes for independence next month, there’s a case for dismantling the Union Jack, which takes elements of the Scottish, English and Irish national emblems. 10. Uber hires Obama’s former strategist. Anyone who’s used Uber’s on-demand ridesharing service knows that the future of traditional taxis is all but doomed. But it’s facing a long battle to wedge itself into the market against a powerful player, so who better to lead its policy and strategy division than Barack Obama’s campaign manager during the 2008 election, David Plouffe? Obama himself described Plouffe as the one “who never gets any credit, but has built the best political campaign, I think, in the history of the United States”. Bonus item: The future of news!

Thomson ReutersChairman of the House Financial Services Committee, Hensarling questions financial regulators about the effects of the Volcker RuleBy Mark Felsenthal WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Top members of the House of Representatives Financial Services panel are threatening to subpoena the U.S. Export-Bank over the bank's refusal to make three employees available for questioning as Congress considers whether to renew the bank's charter. Chairman Jeb Hensarling and Representative Patrick McHenry, who chairs an oversight subcommittee, also expressed sharply worded disapproval that the bank had heavily redacted meeting transcripts sought by lawmakers. "The bank's inadequate and unacceptable response deprives the committee of information necessary to critically examine the bank's day-to-day operations and assess proposed legislation submitted by the bank in connection with its request for reauthorization," Hensarling and McHenry wrote in a letter made public Tuesday. Another panel, the House Oversight Committee, had also requested documents on allegations that bank officials were suspended or removed as investigators looked into charges of improper gifts or kickbacks. Lawmakers on the Financial Services panel said they needed the information to evaluate the bank's request for reauthorization. Bank President Fred Hochberg, an appointee of President Barack Obama, declined to make the three staff members available to the Financial Services committee, saying it is not common practice to do so and that lawmakers did not say what they wanted to discuss. Hensarling and McHenry said that the bank's refusal to comply was surprising in light of the bank's reauthorization proposal and its hopes to expand its lending authority. "The committee will not countenance the bank's failure to cooperate in a full and transparent manner with legitimate congressional oversight," they said. The lawmakers said they would work with the Oversight panel, which is chaired by Darrell Issa, to compel the bank to make the individuals available, including through subpoenas if necessary. A spokesperson for Issa's committee said such measures were possible. "All options are on the table to obtain information from the Ex-Im bank about their recent corruption scandals," Oversight Committee communications director Becca Glover Watkins said. Ex-Im Bank provides loans, loan guarantees and credit insurance to help private companies export goods overseas. Its biggest beneficiaries are companies such as Boeing and Caterpillar, but smaller exporters also receive financing. The bank's charter is set to expire at the end of September. Many conservatives in Congress would like to end the bank, which they view as an unnecessary federal agency that benefits big firms while putting taxpayers at risk should borrowers default. Opponents say its services should be provided by the private sector. The issue has pitted moderate Republicans and business groups such as the Chamber of Commerce against more conservative lawmakers who see eliminating the bank as an important statement of principle. The standoff poses another challenge for the Republican leadership of House Speaker John Boehner, who has been reluctant to cross the most conservative members of his caucus. Ex-Im Bank supporters, who include most Democrats and Obama, argue that the bank's financial backing is critical for U.S. businesses and that letting its charter expire would cost American jobs.

Thomson ReutersA portrait of the Snapchat logo in Ventura(Reuters) - Snapchat Inc, developer of a mobile app that lets users send messages that disappear within seconds, might expand its service to videos, news articles and advertisements, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday. The California-based company is in talks with advertisers and media companies about a service called Snapchat Discovery, the Journal reported, citing sources. Snapchat Discovery, rumored to debut in November, will show content and ads to Snapchat users, the Journal quoted the sources as saying. At least a dozen media companies have shown interest in providing content for Snapchat Discovery, the Journal said. Snapchat Discovery will allow users to read publications and  watch video clips by holding down a finger on the screen, as they do with photos and other messages on the app, the report said. Snapchat, popular among teenage users, was not immediately available for comment outside regular business hours.  (Reporting by Tanvi Mehta in Bangalore; Editing by Steve Orlofsky) FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersBatista, Chairman and CEO of EBX Group speaks at a dinner panel discussion at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly HillsBy Juliana Schincariol RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - The results of more than a dozen investigations into market manipulation by Brazilian entrepreneur Eike Batista and current or former executives of his EBX Group, will likely be made public next year, a top regulator said. "Perhaps the verdicts won't come this year. They might not be given until next year," Leonardo Pereira, who heads the country's securities regulator, CVM, told Reuters in an interview on Monday. "It is a big task and we are not finished yet." Pereira could not go into detail as the cases were ongoing. The CVM wants to determine whether Batista withheld information that was unfavorable to some of his businesses, while encouraging investors to buy more stock in his companies. Although not formerly charged, Batista and the others could face criminal or civil charges if the securities regulator finds sufficient evidence of wrongdoing. Potential penalties are unclear at this time. In the aftermath of the fall of Brazil's richest man and Latin America's largest ever bankruptcy, 11 cases are being processed. A further 11 early-stage investigations are also proceeding. The two most high-profile cases involve accusations that Batista took advantage of privileged information at his oil company Óleo e Gás Participações (formerly OGX) and his shipbuilding firm OSX. Both went bankrupt as they struggled under mounting debt, missed production targets and operational problems. A spokeswoman for EBX declined to comment.  (Writing by Stephen Eisenhammer.

Jamison Gibson-ParkFA Insights is a daily newsletter from Business Insider that delivers the top news and commentary for financial advisors.  MOODY'S: Corporate Liquidity Is In Good Condition Despite Recent Bond Sell-offs (Barron's) According to the Liquidity-Stress Index from Moody's Investors Service, corporate liquidity is not at concerning levels, even after the high-yield bond selloff last month. The index rose from 3.9% to 4.1% in August, Michael Aneiro reported for Barron's. Aneiro said another Moody's index showed that risk of violating debt covenants is staying low. “Good earnings performance, successful maturity extensions and covenant relaxation continue to support the liquidity positions of speculative-grade companies. While we are watching to see whether recent softness in the new issuance market will pose a meaningful headwind, the post-Labor Day pipeline appears material and spreads are not at levels that suggest a broad pull-back in liquidity," John Puchalla from Moody's corporate finance group said in a statement. Here's How To Protect Yourself From Short-Duration Risks (AllianceBernstein Blog) As investors enter into short-duration strategies to defend against rising interest rates, they need to think about the risks that come with them. Ivan Rudolph-Shabinsky from AllianceBernstein recommended being wary in case yield spreads widen, or volatility becomes too high.  "If there’s a credit selloff, investors tend to rush out of high yield and into government bonds and other higher-quality assets. This would cause government bond yields to fall, and investors could see both sides of their portfolios take a hit: the high-yield bonds would suffer and the interest-rate hedges would lose value as Treasury yields fell," Rudolph-Shabinsky said. "We think there’s a better approach to build a low-volatility high-yield allocation: buy individual bonds that do have short-term maturities and bonds that are likely to be called in the near future," he said. "This effectively shortens duration and provides the attractive return profile we described. We think it’s also important to avoid the riskiest credits. In a credit-sell-off, a short-duration portfolio that sidesteps these potential pitfalls is more likely to outperform the market." Investors Are Addicted To The 'Bad News Is Good' Trade (BlackRock Blog) On the BlackRock Blog, Russ Koesterich warned against a common error: seeing bad news as good. He explained that because the Federal Reserve implemented quantitative easing in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, investors have come to associate weak economic news with easy monetary policy. "In my opinion, however, a change in the Fed’s intended monetary policy is unlikely, at least based on recent economic reports," Koesterich wrote. "While the U.S. economy does have persistent pockets of softness (such as household spending) and does face significant headwinds (like slow wage growth), it is generally improving. Though the U.S. economic recovery is certainly uneven, when you look at recent economic data overall, it’s evident that the recovery is gaining steam and that the U.S. economy has fully recovered from the first quarter’s economic contraction." "So, rather than continue to hope for an unlikely sea change in Fed policy, investors would do better to focus on relative valuation, which has become a key differentiator of performance lately. Despite lingering economic headwinds, market segments with relatively cheap valuations have been attracting buyers, a trend I expect to continue," he said. Financial Advisors Should Be Tapping Into Their Staff To Find More Referrals (Wall Street Journal) Personal recommendations are great for financial advisors, but an article from the WSJ suggested that advisors are missing out on a great source – their staff. Veronica Dagher wrote for WSJ that junior advisors, administrative assistants, and operational staff can all help find new leads for business. "To get them really involved, 'firms should create a referral culture,' says Jylanne Dunne, senior vice president of practice management at Fidelity Investments in Boston," she wrote. "This means training staff not just to provide great service, but to be mindful of opportunities and skillful at telling the company's "story"--that is, a concise description of its mission. And they should be rewarded when they succeed at bringing in new leads," Dagher said. Partial Premium Payments Are Costing Your Clients More In Hidden Fees (Wealth Management) In an article for Wealth Management, Alan Lavine outlined the ways your clients may be paying more than they need to on premium payments. According to a report from Insurance Forum, clients need to take into account both the higher payments, and the Annual Percentage Rate. "Take the example of a policy that charges a quarterly premium of $270, or $1,080 per year," Lavine wrote. "That same policy has an annual premium of $1,000. Your client’s decision to pay premiums quarterly means a whopping 21.5 percent annual percentage rate." "You’d think the difference is a mere 8 percent annually, but that’s deceptive, suggests The Insurance Forum’s Joseph Belth, a professor at the University of Indiana," he said. "Unlike a loan, a policyholder who opts to get an advance on the $1,000 annual premium by paying quarterly installments lacks the use of that full borrowed $1,000, Belth says. By knowing the APR, the policyholder can determine whether it’s better to borrow the money to pay the annual premium or opt for fractional premium payments."  FREE AppDownload

Rob Wile, data via GTM ResearchThe solar panel glut appears to be ebbing. For the past five years or so, the world has found itself awash in solar panels. Thanks to an initial spurt of European incentives for renewable energy and subsequent production boom out out of China, prices for solar module units went into a multi-year decline.  But the global solar boom has finally brought down supplies, and 2014 looks to be the tightest supply year in nearly half a decade, according to GTM Research.  "The global PV supply chain has rebounded strongly from the overcapacity-induced lows of 2011 to 2013, with robust demand growth from markets such as China, Japan and the U.S. coming into contact with a fitter, leaner supply chain," GTM's Jade Jones and Shyam Mehta write. "With 2014 expected to be the PV market's tightest supply year in nearly half a decade, supply constraints and rising input costs are expected to result in meaningful increases in pricing across the PV value chain." Prices for solar modules — the industry term for panels — actually started going up around this time last year. That was their first price increase in three years. Global module prices are actually back down this year, with the exception of those in the U.S. However, prices for Polysilicon and wafers, which are used to make the solar cells in the panels, went up in the first half of 2014. "In general, I would say that this is the healthiest shape that the solar supply chain has been in since 2010," Mehta said in an email to Business Insider.  FREE AppDownload

While kids' camp attendance has declined, forcing many organizations to shutter their cabins and sell off their land, the number of camps for grown-ups has swelled faster than a mosquito bite, totaling 800. That's an estimated 10% increase a year over the past 10 years, according to the American Camp Association affiliate GrownUpCamps.com. And when campfire s'mores and sing-alongs are mixed with "flip cup" tournaments and a bunch of singles cavorting to DJ music, the result is a rowdy sleepaway camp experience unlike the one you may remember from childhood.

TASER International makes wearable police cameras, and in the last five trading days, the stock has gained 30%. A Bloomberg report last Friday quoted an analyst who said that shares of TASER were trading higher on speculation that more officers will be wearing cameras, saying the advance is, "directly related to what's happening in Missouri." On Monday, TASER shares gained 5%, which followed a more than 9% gain on Friday.  Tuesday's advances comes after an announcement by Ferguson officials, posted by The Wire, comes after another tough night in Ferguson on Monday, which saw police fire several rounds of tear gas and stun grenades into a crowed of protestors.

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson A boy raises his hands and chants "Hands up, don't shoot" during a peaceful demonstration, as communities react to the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri August 14, 2014. A group of people cannot be isolated unless another group of people is insulated.  One cannot happen without the other.  This is a factor in the way American communities have been constructed since time immemorial.  That is behind much of the conflict in Ferguson, Missouri.This struck me as I read a recent piece on Buzzfeed about Ferguson's racial divide.  Is there one?  It depends on who you ask.  One white resident says: And a black resident disagrees: How can there be such starkly opposing views of the same town?  The mayor's comments tipped me off: You might expect him to say that.  But here's the revealing comment: It just so happens that Ferguson's homeowners are overwhelmingly white, while its renters are overwhelmingly black.  Characterizing one group as being invested in the community and the other as interlopers reveals how one group is isolated and the other is insulated.I've been accused in the past of viewing the growth and expansion of the suburbs through a racial prism.  I acknowledge that growing up in Detroit, and seeing its transformation right before my eyes in the '70s and '80s, might make me think that way.  But I also do recognize the aspirational nature of suburban migration for all who move there.  My family nearly made the move to the burbs in the '70s before deciding to stay put in Detroit, and I remember being saddened by my parents' decision as a child. But I've never felt that, at least for many Rust Belt cities, that the move to the suburbs was entirely aspirational, that race was often a fairly significant component.I pulled some demographic data from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey to get an understanding of Ferguson.  Maybe some residents can say there is no racial divide in Ferguson, but there are pretty sharp differences.  To many, Ferguson is a proud, middle-class community of well-educated middle-age homeowners.  I'm sure if you ask them, they know their neighbors, they love their local businesses and restaurants and they enjoy the comfortable life they live.They are insulated.To many more, Ferguson is a community of working-class residents, largely young, living barely above poverty.  They mostly rent, they have lower education levels.  If you ask them, they likely recently moved to Ferguson to escape similar conditions in St. Louis, but are growing increasingly frustrated with their lack of progress in the community.They are isolated.One cannot exist without the other.I know communities like Ferguson.  I've worked in communities like Ferguson.  Don't believe for one second that Ferguson is unique -- there are thousands of communities just like it throughout the nation.  Those communities just haven't had a terrible tragedy serve as a flash point for social and economic frustrations of the black community.  At least not yet.People are slowly beginning to understand the mechanisms of recent racial isolation.  Slavery, of course, is easily understood as a tool of racial exclusion.  Jim Crow laws are just as easily understood.  Ta-Nehisi Coates' recent masterpiece The Case for Reparations eloquently described the tools recent racial isolation -- redlining and blockbusting tactics squeezed wealth from black residents and created poor communities entirely different than previous poor communities in our nation.  Harvard professor Robert Sampson, interviewed for the reparations article, talked about Chicago's poor black neighborhoods, and how they compare to other cities nationwide: In other words, Chicago’s impoverished black neighborhoods—characterized by high unemployment and households headed by single parents—are not simply poor; they are “ecologically distinct.” This “is not simply the same thing as low economic status,” writes Sampson. “In this pattern Chicago is not alone.” Today, redlining and blockbusting are patently illegal.  They still may occur, but there is growing awareness of the practices and the damages they've incurred.  But little attention is given to the practices of insulation -- creating physical and social/cultural separation from undesirable conditions.  This is the last bastion of segregation, and it's what's at work in Ferguson at this time.Insulation can occur in city neighborhoods or in distant exurbs, but it is largely a suburban phenomenon.  There are communities that have been distinct enclaves -- historic Dearborn, MI in suburban Detroit or the pre-'90s Bridgeport neighborhood in Chicago come to mind -- and there are newer communities that have worked hard to establish and maintain an idyllic nature to them, signalling to others that their community is for just a select few.  Here are some of the tools of insulation employed by communities: The farther one goes from a city center, there is a difference in how insulation tactics are employed. Focusing on the first three tools listed above might be enough for a suburb that's 30 miles from the core city.  A community that's much closer to the city might want to put more insulation practices in place. But what if your community is squarely in the path of black suburban migration?  What if your suburban community has affordable homes, a high number of multifamily rental units, or is even accessible by public transit? The remnants of your community might retreat to the highest value area of single family homes, and let the law and order tactic take over.  You might hold on to your reality, even as everything you know changes. Several years ago I was working for a community, and I was asked by the city manager to do a demographic analysis for the local school district.  I did, and found an interesting trend.  The community was rapidly moving toward becoming a majority-minority community, and would likely do so within the decade.  The city manager's response?  It simply could not be true, because it did not conform with his experience in the city, nor of others like him.  He questioned the validity of the data and suggested I remove race and ethnic data from the analysis.  The school district, you know, just wants to know the number of kids that they would be expected to serve. You cannot have isolation without insulation. This article originally appeared at The Corner Side Yard.  Copyright 2014. FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersA dog appears in a movie on a television inside a private dog suite at a PetSmart PetsHotel and Doggie Day Camp in Los AngelesNEW YORK (Reuters) - PetSmart Inc plans to explore a potential sale of the company, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday, after several shareholders led by activist investor Jana Partners LLC pressured the pet supply retailer to sell itself. PetSmart, which has a market capitalization of nearly $7 billion, could announce the intention to explore strategic alternatives as soon as this week, although the timing could yet change, one person said. There is no guarantee the review will lead to a deal and PetSmart could still determine that it would be better off on its own, the people cautioned, asking not to be named because the matter is not public. Representatives for PetSmart could not be immediately reached for comment. Shares of PetSmart were up 3.4 percent at $70.80 in late afternoon trading.   (Reporting by Soyoung Kim in New York; Editing by Leslie Adler) FREE AppDownload

REUTERS/Aly Song Stock market bulls are beating bears this week.Stocks rallied for the second straight day as housing data on Tuesday morning came in better than expected while inflation data was in-line with expectations. First, the scoreboard: And now, the top stories on Tuesday: 1. The pace of housing starts rose 15.7% to an annualized pace of 1.093 million units in July, beating expectations for a pace of 965,000. Permits increased 8.1% to a rate of 1.052 million, which was in-line with expectations. Ian Shepherdson at Pantheon Macroeconomics had a mixed read on the report. "In one line: Startling headline gains but underlying trend in core single-family is much less exciting," Shepherdson said. "In the single-family sector activity has returned to its pre-winter level but permits are starting to level off again. With the stock of homes for sale well above its cycle lows, price gains slowing and new home sales flat, it is hard to see why construction would keep rising."  2. The latest consumer price index, or CPI, report from the BLS showed that "core" inflation, which strips out food and gas, rose just 0.1% month-over-month in July, slower than the 0.2% that was expected by economists. Headline CPI, which includes food and fas, rose just 0.1% month-over-month, the slowest increase for the headline index since February. On a year-over-year basis, core CPI was up 2% and the headline reading was up 1.9%, with both readings in-line with expectations. Following the report, Paul Dales at Capital Economics said, "The recent softening in U.S. core prices eases some of the pressure on the Fed to start considering rate hikes, although in our view only temporarily." 3. Home improvement giant Home Depot was the biggest gainer on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, gaining 5.5% after reporting same-store sales that grew 5.8% in the second quarter. Home Depot also earned $1.52 per share in the quarter, topping expectations for earnings of $1.44. Home Depot's gain was also good for the second largest percentage gain on the S&amp;P 500.  4. Fragrance maker Elizabeth Arden saw shares get absolutely crush, falling more than 23% after reporting quarterly sales that widely missed expectations. Arden said its sales were impacted by a steeper than expected decline in sales of its celebrity fragrances, including its Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift fragrances. Sales in the quarter also fell 28.4% from the same period a year ago, more than the 10% decline expected by analysts. Arden also said that in the current quarter it expects to be challenged by the same factors that affected recent quarters. 5. Shares of chicken chain El Pollo Loco fell nearly 10% after analysts at Morgan Stanley initiated coverage of the stock with an "Underweight" rating and a $22 price target, saying the newly-public stock has gotten ahead of itself. "The market appears to be paying a premium ... far above what we consider to be fair value — and well above any reasonable peer comparable," wrote analysts John Glass and Jake Bartlett. Glass and Bartlett outlined three cases for how the shares could trade from here: "Pollo en Fuego," "Pollo Bueno," and "Pollo Muertos." 6. Shares of Dick's Sporting Goods were up more than 1% after reporting earnings that beat expectations, though the sporting good retailer said it would take a $20.4 million charge in the second quarter related to its golf business. "We have consolidated our Golf Galaxy merchandising, marketing, and store operations into Dick's Sporting Goods," Dick's CEO Edward Stack said. "In addition, we have eliminated specific staff in our golf area within our Dick's Sporting Goods stores. These changes are necessitated by the current and expected trends in golf."  7.

REUTERS/Steve MarcusPresident of Steven A. Cohen's hedge fund Point72, Thomas Conheeney, is the latest of over a dozen top employees to leave the firm this year, the New York Times reported Monday. Conheeney was also the president of Cohen's previous hedge fund, SAC Capital, which came under fire by the SEC for insider trading charges. The closed firm pleaded guilty to the charges in April. Along with Conheeney, SAC Chief Operating Officer Solomon Kumin, SAC Head of Compliance Steve Kessler, portfolio manager Gabriel Plotkin, and several other prominent portfolio managers also left Cohen's fund in the past year. Kumin and Plotkin are both looking to raise money to set up their own separate funds, NYT said. In a email to his employees, Cohen said that Conheeney's departure was "mutual and amicable." According to the NYT, the email continued: “The last few years have been the most difficult our firm has faced. The 2008 financial crisis and the 2010 aftershocks tested us, and just as we thought we were returning to ‘normal,’ we were rocked by revelations of insider trading by former employees. Tom’s leadership helped our firm survive these difficult times. We faced ordeals that would have put most other companies out of business,"  Conheeney will be succeeded by Douglas Haynes, who came aboard in February, formerly a director at McKinsey &amp; Company.

MSNBCIt's not just the CEO's that have participated in the ALS Ice Bucket challenge. MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell accepted the ALS Ice Bucket challenge from Florida Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz.  Her Ice Bucket challenge video featured her husband, Alan Greenspan, who had the honor of pouring the bucket of ice water over her head.  Greenspan served as the Chairman of the Federal Reserve from 1987 to 2006. The ALS Association stated that from July 29, 2014 to August 18, 2014 $22.9 million has been raised, according to the MSNBC clip. $1.9 million was raised during the same period last year — which is only 8.29% of this year's amount. Mitchell nominated Chuck Todd, Hillary Clinton, and John Kerry for the next ice bucket challenges. You can watch the whole thing here:  FREE AppDownload
Stock prices are driven by three basic forces: 1) earnings, 2) dividends, and 3) valuation, or the premium investors are willing to pay for rights to those earnings and dividends. The most basic measure of valuation is price-to-earnings, or P/E. This ratio has been higher than usual lately. In other words, stocks have been looking expensive. Indeed, higher-than-usual valuations have had some market watchers warning that stocks are doomed to fall as those P/E ratios revert to their means. However, falling prices aren't the only things that make stock valuations mean-revert and become cheaper. Rising earnings and improving expectations for earnings can also do the job. And this latter force has allowed us to experience a stock market rally even as valuations have shrunk. "Different than 2013, however, the move higher is driven primarily by stronger EPS rather than a re-rating of market multiples," wrote RBC Capital Markets' Jonathan Golub. "More specifically, the market is currently projecting $128 of earnings (next-12-months) versus $119 at the beginning of the year. Furthermore, forward P/Es have actually contracted modestly, making stocks a more attractive purchase." In other words, earnings are expected to grow at a faster than the pace at which stocks are rising. Golub shared this chart decomposing the drivers of this year's 7.1% return in the S&amp;P 500. As you can see, contracting valuation have been a detriment, taking around 0.8% off of the rally. However, this has been overwhelmingly offset by the forces of earnings per share growth (revenue, margins, and buybacks). RBC Capital Markets FREE AppDownload

Thomson ReutersAllergan CEO Pyott speaks during an interview in New York(Reuters) - Botox maker Allergan Inc has approached Salix Pharmaceuticals Ltd and at least one other company about a potential takeover in a bid to avert the $53 billion hostile takeover from Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc, the Wall Street Journal said. Allergan and Salix declined to comment on the matter. Shares of Salix, which itself is in the process of merging with a unit of Swiss-listed Cosmo Pharmaceuticals, jumped about 10 percent on Tuesday. It isn't clear where any talks with Salix stand, but one of the sources said Allergan could strike a takeover deal with the company or another unknown party as early as next month, Journal said. (http://on.wsj.com/Xy8EJx) Raleigh, North Carolina-based Salix makes products used to prevent or treat gastrointestinal disorders. So far, it has generated sales of $766.4 million this year. Cosmo said in July it would merge its Irish subsidiary with Salix, another example of overseas deal-making by U.S. companies seeking to lower their tax bill by shifting tax domiciles abroad. William Ackman's hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital Management, which owns nearly 10 percent of Allergan, worked with Valeant to put together the takeover deal unveiled in April.

El Pollo LocoSouthern California-based El Pollo Loco, which went public just three weeks ago, has already seen its shares climb as much as 71%. Before Tuesday, the stock was trading around $33. Today shares were down 10%. In a new note, Morgan Stanley's John Glass and Jake Bartlett say they are initiating coverage on the stock with an under-weight rating and a $22 price target, saying it's gotten far out ahead of a host of metrics. "The market appears to be paying a premium ... far above what we consider to be fair value — and well above any reasonable peer comparable," they write. "We note that several other recent IPOs have followed a similar course, with initial valuations based more on scarcity value than fundamentals. Many of these have underperformed post the initial IPO upside."  The pair then present three cases for how shares could trade from here, which they call "Pollo en Fuego," "Pollo Bueno," and "Pollo Muertos." No really: Morgan StanleyThe main risk, they say, is that the chain fails to meet its ambitious growth plans: The company plans to go from opening six new stores a year for the past three years to 45 new ones in the next three. This could produce margin pressures, site selection missteps and delays, they write.   They also note that Pollo Loco was recently trading at 56x earnings, compared with the 32x rate of closest peer Fiesta (which owns Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana) and 39x for current burrito king Chipotle.  And as articulated in the Pollo Muertos case above, they seem to be betting heavily on success in large markets like Houston. If those fail to take off they are likely to struggle elsewhere.  But the rest of the note is pretty upbeat. They cite a host of items the firm has going for it, including strong leadership from CEO Steve Sather, who's put together a team of deputies from leading fast-food chains; an  increasingly diverse clientele that now has Hispanics accounting for just of 29% of diners compared with 45% for Caucasians; and 12 consecutive quarters of positive same-store sales growth. Even in the "Muertos" case, a 24x multiple still bests those of regional fast-food chains.  And of course there's the pollo itself: LOCO’s menu pricing is attractive, with its traditional family meal business comparable to offers at chicken based QSRs like KFC (with what we consider to be better quality and certainly healthier fare), while its newer entre´e business (burritos, etc.) are priced 10-15% lower than comparable items at Mexican fast casuals (e.g. CMG). We think this positioning in unique in the market and sets LOCO up well. ELP’s price point is similar to traditional QSR competitors but 10-15$ below fast casual. FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersThe logo of German rail operator Deutsche Bahn is pictured in BerlinBERLIN (Reuters) - Deutsche Bahn is suing airlines in the United States for operating a price-fixing cartel affecting its freight business between 1999-2006, the German transport company told Reuters. The airlines' price fixing was first exposed seven years ago and triggered fines of 800 million euros in the European Union in 2010 and a fine of $1.5 billion in the United States. Victims of the cartel can sue separately for compensation. Deutsche Bahn said the companies targeted by the lawsuit in New York include Air France-KLM &lt;airf.pa&gt;, Scandinavia's SAS &lt;sas.st&gt;, Qantas Airways &lt;qan.ax&gt;, Cargolux Airlines International [CLUX.UL], Martinair Holland [MART.UL] and All Nippon Airways &lt;9202.T&gt;. Deutsche Bahn transports 390.1 million tons of freight a year, via land, rail, sea and air. It made 39.1 billion euros ($5.3 billion) in revenues last year and operates in more than 130 countries. A source familiar with the case said Deutsche Bahn's claim stood at more than $500 million. Deutsche Bahn declined to comment on the sum involved. The current lawsuit concerns airlines flying to and from the United States, as well as within the country.

REUTERS/Price ChambersFrom the Kansas City Fed's Economic Policy Symposium continues in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, August 26, 2011. All eyes will be on Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where The Kansas City Federal Reserve will host its annual economic policy symposium. The event kicks off on Thursday, August 21. The topic of this year's meeting: "Re-Evaluating Labor Market Dynamics."  This is a perfect topic given what's happening in the economy right now.  Among the participants who will be speaking include Janet Yellen and Mario Draghi. Deutsche Bank's Carl Riccadonna said in commentary ahead of Jackson Hole that Yellen — who speaks on Friday — is likely to highlight some of the employment data that hasn't normalized to pre-financial crisis levels.  "There has been an ongoing debate among economists regarding the amount of slack in the economy and labor market," Riccadonna said. "While the unemployment rate provides a useful metric of excess labor supply, it is an imperfect gauge due to measurement issues relating to marginal labor force participants." Below we present the outlines of the labor market puzzle that will get a lot of discussion. In the last year, the unemployment rate has fallen steadily, and each of the last six months have seen job gains of at least 200,000, the first such stretch since 1997.  As of the July jobs report, the unemployment rate was 6.2%, which clearly has the Fed a bit caught out. In June 2013, the Fed's Summary of Economic Projections showed the FOMC expecting the unemployment rate to fall somewhere between 6.5%-6.8% at the end of this year. Risks remain that the unemployment could again fall below the Fed's expectations, with a year-end unemployment rate of 6%-6.1% expected at the end of this year, according to the Fed's most recent projections. But these headline numbers aren't quite convincing the Fed that things are getting good. In its latest FOMC statement, the Fed said, "a range of labor market indicators suggests that there remains significant underutilization of labor resources."  Chris Rupkey at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi said this commentary signaled that the Fed has "further demoted" the unemployment rate as a policy guide.  In other words, the dropping unemployment rate alone won't cause the Fed to conclude the labor market is "tight." FRED But in addition to a falling unemployment rate, the number of job openings has also been on the rise, showing that perhaps some "slack" is, in fact, coming out of the labor market. "Slack" in the labor market is a way to say how many job seekers there are for each available opening. A "loose" or "slack" labor market has excess demand for openings, giving employers leverage; a "tight" labor market has more demand for labor, giving employees leverage. The latest JOLTS report, or job openings and labor turnover survey, which is one of Yellen's preferred economic data reports, showed that job openings recently reached a 13-year high.  And so a question the Fed is likely asking itself: how much slack is in the labor market? Specifically, there should be discussion about whether the surging number of unfilled jobs is a reflection of the weak economy, or whether it's something more structural (employers can't find people with the proper skills) FRED An interesting wrinkle, pointed out by Dean Baker, here is that while you might be tempted to say that surging unfilled job openings reflect workers not having the proper skills, one of the fastest areas of jobs growth is in food service, which is not what we're told are the skills people are lacking for (usually people say it's tech skills that are causing the disparity) FRED The labor force participation rate has been steadily falling over the last two decades. Some of this decline is due to changing demographics. The population is aging, and many workers who were at or near retirement age ahead of the financial crisis haven't made it back into the workforce.  But an aging population doesn't answer all the questions, since the labor force participation rate has also dropped for prime-age workers. FRED Deutsche Bank's Carl Riccadonna wrote ahead of Jackson Hole that Yellen has, "expressed sympathy with the view that there is a substantial cyclical component to the participation decline in recent years." Those who believe the labor market is recovering solidly will say that the labor force participation rate reflects demographic factors, but others aren't so sure.  The July jobs report on August 1 showed showed non-farm payrolls grew by 209,000 in July, but the number of workers employed part-time for economic reasons — or workers who want full-time work but can't find it — still remains way above where it was before the financial crisis.  FRED FRED In his preview of Jackson Hole, Michael Gapen at Barclays said, "While it is clear the [FOMC] is focused on labor market conditions, it is not clear exactly on what variables it is focused or how participants will judge progress."  Wage growth has also been tepid, roughly keeping pace with inflation over the last several years, and not leaving workers feeling as confident as other data might suggest.  And so the labor market appears to have data standing on either side of a stark divide: a labor market coming back to life, and a labor market still mired in dysfunction.  FRED Wall Street  wasn't invited to this year's edition of the conference, but they'll have their attention turned to Wyoming this week.  Yellen's comments aren't expected to give major explicit signals about the direction of Fed policy the way commentary from her predecessor Ben Bernanke did in 2010 and 2012.  In a note to clients ahead of the meeting, Ethan Harris at Bank of American Merrill Lynch wrote that, "With significant policy changes a long way off, and with the intense market focus on Jackson Hole, we expect [Yellen] to try to say nothing interesting about the policy outlook." Harris adds that, "if the Chair wants to be a bit more interesting, presumably, she will talk a bit about why she still sees a long recovery ahead in the labor market, pointing to the weakness in wages and broader measures of slack." There are a number of speakers at Jackson Hole, and while Yellen is headliner, Harris notes that, "criticism of the Fed is a useful 'stress test' for Chair Yellen and her allies." And so Yellen will be as much attuned to critiques of Fed policy from other conference participants as she is on spelling out some of her concerns regarding the state of the labor market.

REUTERS/Edgar Su New York has banned Standard Chartered Bank from accepting new dollar clearing accounts without the state's approval after the London-based firm failed to improve money laundering controls. Standard Chartered's Hong Kong subsidiary has also been suspended from high-risk retail dollar clearing, and will be forced to end high-risk client relationships at its United Arab Emirates branches. The bank has also agreed to pay a $300 million penalty. "If a bank fails to live up to its commitments, there should be consequences," Department of Financial Services Superintendent Ben Lawsky said in a statement. "That is particularly true in an area as serious as anti-money-laundering compliance, which is vital to helping prevent terrorism and vile human rights abuses." The penalties relate to Standard Chartered's 2012 settlement with the state for $340 million for lying about Iranian money laundering. As part of that agreement, Standard Chartered allowed the state to set up an independent oversight authority. That authority subsequently found that the bank "failed to detect a large number of potentially high-risk transactions for further review."

Thomson ReutersA sign is seen on the door of a Citibank branch in New YorkNEW YORK (Reuters) - Citigroup has told the U.S. appeals court overseeing the dispute between Argentina and hedge funds refusing to accept terms of the country's debt restructuring that its Argentine banking license may be at risk as a result of the standoff. That is because under orders from U.S. District Judge Thomas Griesa, Citibank Argentina is barred from distributing payments it will receive from Argentina to holders of a class of restructured bonds that are governed under Argentine law. Meanwhile, the Argentine government has demanded that the bank honor its obligations under local law. Citi expects to receive about $5 million from Argentina ahead of its next coupon payment deadline of Sept. 30. Argentina, whose appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court stalled in June when the high court refused to take the case, has flouted orders by Griesa that it may not pay creditors who agreed to the restructuring until it pays the hedge funds the full face value of the bonds they hold. In June it deposited a $539 million payment to those bondholders with its trustee, Bank of New York Mellon. "It is increasingly apparent that the mandatory payment injunctions directed to the republic cannot be enforced," Citigroup said in a court filing late Monday, adding that the Citibank injunction could lead to the loss of its banking license in Argentina and its takeover by the republic. Argentina accounts for a small part of Citigroup’s business. Its exposure to the country at the end of June from securities and from loans, including those to businesses and consumers, was only $2.7 billion compared with $1.9 trillion in total assets worldwide, according to Citigroup’s most recently quarterly filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Meanwhile, the New York Post reported on Tuesday that Paul Singer, head of Elliott Management, one of the main holdout creditors in the case, intends to widen his hunt for assets connected to Argentina's leaders. Last week, Elliott won a ruling from a U.S. magistrate in Nevada allowing him to push ahead with subpoenas to 123 companies based in the state that have ties to associates of the family of Argentine President Cristina Fernandez. The Post, citing an unnamed source "familiar with Singer's thinking," said he intends to use the ruling to issue subpoenas to at least two companies controlled by Cristobal Lopez, a friend of Fernandez's late husband and her predecessor as president, Nestor Kirchner. One of the subpoena targets will be Centenary International , which the Post described as a shell company listed as a penny stock on the U.S. over-the-counter market. The paper said that Centenary, while it has no operations and reported a loss of about $1 million last year, recently signed a 10-year lease for 4,000 square feet of office space near New York's Museum of Modern Art at a cost of $34,333 a month. A representative for Centenary could not be located. A spokesman for Elliott was not immediately available for comment.  (Writing by Dan Burns; editing by Andrew Hay) FREE AppDownload

Missouri History MuseumCharles Lindbergh and the Spirit of St. Louis, 1927I don't have time to read many books anymore, so one of my August projects this year is to read some. Most of the books I'm reading are business-related (lots still to learn!). But I'm sneaking in an adventure or two, too. One of the adventures I've just read is the Spirit of St. Louis, Charles Lindbergh's account of his miraculous and inspiring flight from New York to Paris in May, 1927 in a single engine plane. It turns out that that story, too, is an amazing business story — or at least an amazing entrepreneurial story — but I'll save the business part for later. Today, I'll just share a short section that made me smile. For the past decade, as digital media startups have captured an ever-increasing percentage of media readership and influence, incumbent media companies have lobbed all sorts of insults at them.  One of the these was that you couldn't trust what digital-media companies said because they were sometimes wrong. Another was that digital-media companies cared too much about "traffic" (a.k.a., being read).  Well, in the past few years, as digital-media newsrooms have gotten more experienced, it has generally seemed that it's the traditional media companies that make most of the whopper mistakes these days. And it has always seemed an odd criticism to suggest that it's bad for companies that produce work for readers to care about whether those readers actually want to read it.  Anyway, it was amusing to be reminded in the Spirit of St. Louis that complaints about these and other media problems did not start with digital media. They did not even start with television. They started with... newspapers. Here's Mr. Lindbergh on that topic during the days after he had flown the Spirit of St. Louis to New York and was waiting for his equipment to be ready and the weather over the Atlantic to clear: FLYIN' FOOL HOPS TODAY A big front-page picture of myself is below the tabloid headlines. I'm the "flyin' fool," and I'm supposed to be ready to take off for Paris at any moment! Didn't I tell the reporters that I wouldn't leave until the weather was right and my compasses were swung? All they had to do was look in through the door of the hangar if they didn't believe me. Well, I suppose they think this makes a better story... Depending on which paper I pick up, I find that I was born in Minnesota, that I was born in Michigan, that I was Nebraska; that I learned to fly at Omaha, that I learned to fly at Lincoln, that I learned to fly in San Antonio, in Texas. I'm told that my nickname is "Lucky," that I land and take off by looking through periscopes, that without them I can only see downward from my cockpit,  that I carry "devices" on my plane that will enable me to "snatch a snooze" while steering a "beeline" for Paris. After reading the press about the dangers of the flight (which, in fairness to the media, probably weren't grossly exaggerated), Lindbergh's mother decided to take a train from Minnesota to New York  to spend a day with her son. This set off another frenzy. They didn't care how much they hurt her feelings or frightened her about my flight, as long as they got their pictures and stories.... They demanded we embrace for their cameras and say good-bye. When we refused, one paper had two other people go through the motions and substituted photographs of our heads for theirs... Then there was the unnecessary incident with the press on the field. I'd taken [my mechanics] up to check my engine in flight, and on the last landing I had broken my tail skid, simply because some photographers got in the way again. The most annoying thing was that, instead of having a penalty to pay for violating the field regulations, the cameramen got a more valuable picture — and the reporters a "better story..." The fact that I had damaged my plane to avoid hitting someone didn't bother them a bit. Most reporters omitted that from their accounts. "So terrific was his speed that in landing he slightly damaged the machine's tail skid. Undismayed by this accident, which he considered 'trivial,' Lindbergh hopped out wearing a broad smile. 'Boys, she's ready and rarin' to go!' he said." Ah, the good old days. FREE AppDownload
Lucas Jackson/ReutersDemonstrators face off with police after tear gas was fired at protesters reacting to the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri August 17, 2014. Nearly a week after the death of 18 year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., protests continue in the 21,000-person suburban community on St. Louis’ north side and around the nation. Amid the social media and news coverage of the community’s response to the police shooting of the unarmed teenager, a picture of Ferguson and its history has emerged. The New York Times and others have described the deep-seated racial tensions and inequalities that have long plagued the St. Louis region, as well as the dramatic demographic transformation of Ferguson from a largely white suburban enclave (it was 85 percent white as recently as 1980) to a predominantly black community (it was 67 percent black by 2008-2012). Lucas Jackson/ReutersDemonstrators listen to rapper Nelly during a peaceful march in reaction to the shooting of Michael Brown, near Ferguson, Missouri, August 18, 2014.But Ferguson has also been home to dramatic economic changes in recent years. The city’s unemployment rate rose from less than 5 percent in 2000 to over 13 percent in 2010-12. For those residents who were employed, inflation-adjusted average earnings fell by one-third. The number of households using federal Housing Choice Vouchers climbed from roughly 300 in 2000 to more than 800 by the end of the decade. Amid these changes, poverty skyrocketed. Between 2000 and 2010-2012, Ferguson’s poor population doubled. By the end of that period, roughly one in four residents lived below the federal poverty line ($23,492 for a family of four in 2012), and 44 percent fell below twice that level. These changes affected neighborhoods throughout Ferguson. At the start of the 2000s, the five census tracts that fall within Ferguson’s border registered poverty rates ranging between 4 and 16 percent. However, by 2008-2012 almost all of Ferguson’s neighborhoods had poverty rates at or above the 20 percent threshold at which the negative effects of concentrated poverty begin to emerge. (One Ferguson tract had a poverty rate of 13.1 percent in 2008-2012, while the remaining tracts fell between 19.8 and 33.3 percent.) via The Brookings Institution via The Brookings Instituion As dramatic as the growth in economic disadvantage has been in this community, Ferguson is not alone. Within the nation’s 100 largest metro areas, the number of suburban neighborhoods where more than 20 percent of residents live below the federal poverty line more than doubled between 2000 and 2008-2012. Almost every major metro area saw suburban poverty not only grow during the 2000s but also become more concentrated in high-poverty neighborhoods. By 2008-2012, 38 percent of poor residents in the suburbs lived in neighborhoods with poverty rates of 20 percent or higher. For poor black residents in those communities, the figure was 53 percent. Like Ferguson, many of these changing suburban communities are home to out-of-step power structures, where the leadership class, including the police force, does not reflect the rapid demographic changes that have reshaped these places. Suburban areas with growing poverty are also frequently characterized by many small, fragmented municipalities; Ferguson is just one of 91 jurisdictions in St. Louis County. This often translates into inadequate resources and capacity to respond to growing needs and can complicate efforts to connect residents with economic opportunities that offer a path out of poverty. And as concentrated poverty climbs in communities like Ferguson, they find themselves especially ill-equipped to deal with impacts such as poorer education and health outcomes, and higher crime rates. In an article for Salon, Brittney Cooper writes about the outpouring of anger from the community, “Violence is the effect, not the cause of the concentrated poverty that locks that many poor people up together with no conceivable way out and no productive way to channel their rage at having an existence that is adjacent to the American dream.”  None of this means that there are 1,000 Fergusons-in-waiting, but it should underscore the fact that there are a growing number of communities across the country facing similar, if quieter, deep challenges every day.

Economist Intelligence UnitProbably don't want to live in these places. Also The Economist has acknowledged there is an error in the Tunis entry. Living standards in Russia's two biggest cities are slipping. According to an Economist Intelligence Unit survey, Moscow and St. Petersburg have both seen their "liveability" rankings decline more than 3% in the past five years. The survey ranked global cities based on stability, healthcare, culture &amp; environment, education, and infrastructure. The survey does not specify where the pair saw the greatest declines but did note that "events in Ukraine" were having "knock-on" effects.  There is other anecdotal evidence of the decline. According to Global Property Guide, Moscow's resale apartment prices fell by 8% in Q1 on an inflation-adjusted basis. In St. Petersburg they fell by 4.6%. There was actually a surge in purchasing activity in the first half of 2014, but that was only because the ruble had weakened, according to GPG. The ruble has fallen 9% against the dollar in the past 12 months. Cities on the rest of the list, above, have all been experiencing serious problems with unemployment, violence, civil unrest, and instability all around. FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersFile of a Family Dollar store is seen in ChicagoBy Jennifer Ablan NEW YORK (Reuters) - Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn told Reuters late Monday that efforts by Family Dollar’s   board to fend off competing bids in favor of a deal with Dollar Tree  have resulted in more than $300 million being needlessly spent on breakup fees. Icahn has pushed Family Dollar to sell itself to Dollar General  and has been openly critical of Family Dollar Chief Executive Howard Levine, who would have retained his position after an acquisition by Dollar Tree. On Monday, Dollar General offered to buy Family Dollar Stores for $8.9 billion, trumping an agreed-to merger with its rival Dollar Tree and aiming to strengthen its dominance of a growing segment of retailers serving penny-pinching customers. Dollar General has also offered to pay the $305 million breakup fee that would be owed to Dollar Tree if its deal with Family Dollar were to fall apart. "This is a quintessential example and a reflection of what is wrong with Corporate America," Icahn said. "The Family Dollar board is wasting more than $300 million (in breakup fees to Dollar Tree) in an attempt to chill a competing bid from Dollar General, which would keep Howard Levine out of the company once and for all even though the Dollar General bid would enhance the value of Family Dollar stock." Icahn, who in June took a 9.4 percent stake in Family Dollar, had encouraged Family Dollar to sell itself to Dollar General. On Monday, Icahn said he was "surprised" by Family Dollar's deal with Dollar Tree and questioned whether Levine's future role at Dollar Tree could have influenced the company to go ahead with the deal. Dollar Tree said last month that Levine would remain as Family Dollar CEO after the acquisition. Icahn has cut his stake in Family Dollar to 3.6 percent from 9.4 percent as of July 30. In a regulatory filing in August, it was revealed that on June 6, Icahn telephoned Levine to discuss Icahn's stake in Family Dollar and to express an interest in additional communications with Family Dollar's management regarding the company's current operations and future plans, including potential strategic opportunities and business combination transactions. According to the filing, Levine asked Icahn whether he would be willing to sign a non-disclosure agreement and Icahn declined. "It appears that Levine and Family Dollar wanted to neutralize me by getting me to sign a confidentiality agreement," Icahn said. "If Levine and Family Dollar had gotten me to sign it, that would have kept me from doing a proxy fight and in my opinion this would have given Levine 2-3 more years to mismanage the company and keep a competing bid from materializing. I refused to sign the confidentiality agreement." Icahn said: "In my humble opinion, Family Dollar would still be in the hands of Levine and the board if it had not been for my activism." Company officials at Family Dollar were not available for comment.  (Reporting By Jennifer Ablan; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli) FREE AppDownload

REUTERS/Susana VeraThe golf business is depressing right now.The golf industry is weak, and it is hurting sales at retailers like Dick's Sporting Goods. In the second quarter, sales at Dick's Golf Galaxy stores fell 9.3% on a comparable-store basis. This was actually worse than the 8.7% drop forecasted by analysts. Dick's also said it would take a $20.4 million pre-tax charge related to restructuring initiatives in its golf business. These charges include: "We have consolidated our Golf Galaxy merchandising, marketing, and store operations into Dick's Sporting Goods," Dick's CEO Edward Stack said. "In addition, we have eliminated specific staff in our golf area within our Dick's Sporting Goods stores. These changes are necessitated by the current and expected trends in golf. We will invest these cost savings into other aspects of our store operations and into the growth areas of our business." Overall, the quarter wasn't bad for Dick's, which reported company-wide earnings and sales that beat expectations, and in morning trade on Tuesday, Dick's shares were up more than 5%.

Business Insider/Hayley PetersonUrban Outfitters' namesake brand is struggling.  The brand's same-store sales plunged 10% in the second quarter over last year, marking the fourth straight quarter of comparable sales declines.  By comparison, same-store sales increased 21% at Free People and 6% at Anthropologie in the second quarter.  The company blamed Urban Outfitters' poor performance on fashion misses and "what had become incessant promotional activity" in an earnings call with analysts Monday.  President and CEO Richard Hayne outlined three key steps to returning to positive sales. 1. Raise average prices and improve fashion designs. As part of this goal, the company is planning to start selling more higher-quality fabrics. 2. Cut back on the "incessant" promotional activity that has ramped over the last year to clear out unpopular inventory.  To achieve that goal, the brand is reducing the risk associated with fashion misses by making leaner inventory orders, Hayne said.  "Given the difficult women’s apparel and accessory businesses at the Urban brand over the past nine months, those teams were rightfully very conservative when ordering initial back to school inventory," Hayne said, according to a transcript of the call. "Lean buys, combined with strong sell-throughs on a number of items have created more out of stock situations than normal." "The merchants are now in chase mode," so improved same-store sales will be a "gradual process," he added.  3. Better visual merchandising in stores and online. Urban Outfitters wants its stores to become a place where customers want to hang out, not just shop. The company used its newest Manhattan location in Herald Square as an example of this new store concept. The 57,000-square-foot Herald Square store contains a coffee shop, a bookstore, and a hair salon. The company is also focused on better visuals online. Hayne cited one case where a couple items at Free People weren't selling well online, so the brand took new photos of the items. "They went back and reshot those images and saw a fairly substantial lift in the selling," Hayne said. "It brought home to us how important the imagery is when we’re talking about web."  FREE AppDownload
Josh WittenkellerThere has recently been a lot of pressure on Nintendo to bring its software to mobile platforms. The company's hardware business is facing serious decline, with combined sales of Wii U and 3DS all but guaranteed to come up at least 150 million units short of their predecessors' cumulative total. In a year that President Satoru Iwata Nintendo stated would be characterized by a return to profitability, the company's first-quarter report delivered an operating loss of approximately $92.7 million. Shortly after these disappointing numbers, rumors of internal dissatisfaction with Iwata's refusal to explore the mobile market began to circulate. Now, a version of the Pokemon trading card game has been announced for Apple's iPad, and Nintendo's share price has jumped because of it. Is the valuation bump warranted? Will Nintendo soon embrace mobile platforms as hosts for its software? Confirmation that the Pokemon Trading Card Game would come to iPads this year has prompted Nintendo's share price to rise approximately 4%, a notable gain on the heels of the substantial valuation decline that occurred after the release of the company's most recent quarterly report. That said, investor enthusiasm for the move is likely founded on faulty assumptions. While the upcoming iPad version of Pokemon Trading Card Game Online can technically be described as the first Nintendo game to release on a mobile platform, a version of the upcoming title has been available on PC and Mac for over three years, and the title is not developed by a first-party studio. The move to bring the card game to iPads may also not be wholly attributable to Nintendo, as the Japanese hardware and software maker does not have majority ownership of the game's publisher, The Pokemon Company. Also worth noting, the iPad version of Pokemon Trading Card Game Online isn't the first mobile app tied to the long-running and incredibly lucrative franchise. 2012 saw The Pokemon Company publish Pokedex for iOS, an app that provides information and pictures of Pokemon characters, and also prompted the belief that Nintendo would soon take a more proactive approach to smartphone and tablet gaming. The Pokemon Company's foray into mobile was followed by PokeTouch, a Pokemon-themed typing instructor available on PC and iPad in Japan. The fact that "Pokemon" mobile efforts come courtesy of a company Nintendo only owns 32% of suggests the platform holder is continuing to take a tepid stance on releasing games outside of its hardware ecosystem. The beginning of 2014 saw the company confirm that it had no plans to release games on platforms other than its own, instead stating that it would create some type of marketing app. It's not entirely clear whether the iPad version ofPokemon represents a deviation from this stated strategy. If Pokemon Trading Card Game Online for iPad is similar to what's currently available on Mac and PC, it won't feature in-app purchases, instead requiring users to enter codes from physical versions of the trading cards. Accordingly, it's hard to imagine that the upcoming game will generate significant revenue. At best, the impending release looks to be a testing of the waters, and it's easy to see why Nintendo has been hesitant to pursue a greater mobile presence. In the previous fiscal year, approximately 57% of Nintendo's revenue came from the sale of hardware. The basic rationale behind not bringing its properties to mobile platforms is that such a move would take away from the appeal of Nintendo's consoles and complicate the value of its software. The vast majority of mobile gaming revenue comes from in-app purchases in free-to-download software. Given the opportunity to enjoy less-expensive versions of Nintendo's signature gaming experiences, consumers might easily opt to forgo the company's hardware altogether and lose interest in its premium console content. Nintendo is already feeling the negative effects from the rise of smartphones and tablets as gaming platforms, and making its content available on iOS and Android would seemingly give consumers less reason to invest in Nintendo hardware. Platforms like the App Store and Google Play also lack the degree of content oversight found on console platforms, allowing for wide ranges of knock-offs and derivative products. For example, the hugely popular Flappy Bird made illegal use of Nintendo-owned art assets. Alternatively, it's clear that there is a demand for Nintendo-like experiences on mobile platforms, as Pokemon-imitator Micromon climbed to the top of the paid-download charts on the App Store, but the game can be downloaded for just $1.29. Consider that the Pokemon Xand Pokemon Y had combined sales of more than 12 million units as of April 7 at a price in the $40 range, as well as the driving impact that these games had on 3DS hardware sales, and offering ostensibly competing series entries on mobile platforms starts to look like a bad strategy. Nintendo is already committed to the development of its next hardware platforms. As long as the company's business revolves around the sale of gaming consoles, it's difficult to imagine it will bring significant game support to mobile platforms. Meaningful mobile releases could create great short-term windfalls and spur investor excitement, but it would likely further destabilize the company's fundamentals. Nintendo is clearly in need of change going forward, but its structure suggests it will continue to keep its games exclusive to its hardware platforms for at least the next several years. Support for mobile platforms will likely only arrive if the company's next gaming systems and health-based "Quality of Life" platform prove to be duds.    Keith Noonan has no position in any stocks mentioned.

REUTERS/Aly Song Stock market bulls are beating bears this week.Stocks rallied for the second straight day as housing data on Tuesday morning came in better than expected while inflation data was in-line with expectations. First, the scoreboard: And now, the top stories on Tuesday: 1. The pace of housing starts rose 15.7% to an annualized pace of 1.093 million units in July, beating expectations for a pace of 965,000. Permits increased 8.1% to a rate of 1.052 million, which was in-line with expectations. Ian Shepherdson at Pantheon Macroeconomics had a mixed read on the report. "In one line: Startling headline gains but underlying trend in core single-family is much less exciting," Shepherdson said. "In the single-family sector activity has returned to its pre-winter level but permits are starting to level off again. With the stock of homes for sale well above its cycle lows, price gains slowing and new home sales flat, it is hard to see why construction would keep rising."  2. The latest consumer price index, or CPI, report from the BLS showed that "core" inflation, which strips out food and gas, rose just 0.1% month-over-month in July, slower than the 0.2% that was expected by economists. Headline CPI, which includes food and fas, rose just 0.1% month-over-month, the slowest increase for the headline index since February. On a year-over-year basis, core CPI was up 2% and the headline reading was up 1.9%, with both readings in-line with expectations. Following the report, Paul Dales at Capital Economics said, "The recent softening in U.S. core prices eases some of the pressure on the Fed to start considering rate hikes, although in our view only temporarily." 3. Home improvement giant Home Depot was the biggest gainer on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, gaining 5.5% after reporting same-store sales that grew 5.8% in the second quarter. Home Depot also earned $1.52 per share in the quarter, topping expectations for earnings of $1.44. Home Depot's gain was also good for the second largest percentage gain on the S&amp;P 500.  4. Fragrance maker Elizabeth Arden saw shares get absolutely crush, falling more than 23% after reporting quarterly sales that widely missed expectations. Arden said its sales were impacted by a steeper than expected decline in sales of its celebrity fragrances, including its Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift fragrances. Sales in the quarter also fell 28.4% from the same period a year ago, more than the 10% decline expected by analysts. Arden also said that in the current quarter it expects to be challenged by the same factors that affected recent quarters. 5. Shares of chicken chain El Pollo Loco fell nearly 10% after analysts at Morgan Stanley initiated coverage of the stock with an "Underweight" rating and a $22 price target, saying the newly-public stock has gotten ahead of itself. "The market appears to be paying a premium ... far above what we consider to be fair value — and well above any reasonable peer comparable," wrote analysts John Glass and Jake Bartlett. Glass and Bartlett outlined three cases for how the shares could trade from here: "Pollo en Fuego," "Pollo Bueno," and "Pollo Muertos." 6. Shares of Dick's Sporting Goods were up more than 1% after reporting earnings that beat expectations, though the sporting good retailer said it would take a $20.4 million charge in the second quarter related to its golf business. "We have consolidated our Golf Galaxy merchandising, marketing, and store operations into Dick's Sporting Goods," Dick's CEO Edward Stack said. "In addition, we have eliminated specific staff in our golf area within our Dick's Sporting Goods stores. These changes are necessitated by the current and expected trends in golf."  7.

Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesApple CEO Tim Cook, stoked.Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty has a massive report on Apple in which she tells investors to buy shares ahead of what is shaping up to be a giant fall.  She says "this cycle is different" for Apple. Huberty is referring to Apple's product cycle, which is expected to include two new iPhone models with larger screens and a new wearable device that many are calling the iWatch.  Most investors are looking at the iPhone 5 product cycle for comparisons to this year. After all, that was the last time Apple release a major design change (including a bigger a screen) for the iPhone. But things are different this time, and Apple's shares are poised for a big break out as a result, says Huberty. Here are eight reasons this time is different, according to Huberty. "Apple ownership, measured as its average weighting in the portfolios of the top 100 holders, peaked at 4.5% in the September 2012 quarter, and then troughed at 1.9% in the June 2013 quarter," says Huberty. Apple is currently at 2.3%, which is 2009 levels.  It's also lower than Apple's S&amp;P 500 weighting, which is 3.4%. Huberty says other technology companies are more heavily weighted in shareholder portfolios versus their weighting in the S&amp;P 500. As a result, Huberty says, "we see room for investors, particularly managers of large long-only funds, to increase their Apple positions." Morgan StanleyInvestors are increasing ownership of Apple, but still have a ways to go. When the iPhone 5 came out, Apple had a $2 billion dividend and no share repurchases, for a total yield of .5%. This fiscal year, Huberty estimates Apple will have a total yield of 8.5% from $11 billion in dividends, and $31 billion in share repurchases. Since starting its share repurchase, Apple has lowered its share count by 9%. As the yield increases and the share count lowers, the stock price should increase. Apple's stock peaked on the day the iPhone 5 was released. From there, it fell hard. One the main culprits for the decline was a realization that Apple's business was not as hot as everyone thought. Starting in October, analysts began trimming their EPS estimates. As they cut back on their estimates for Apple's earnings, the stock fell. This time, Huberty thinks the opposite will happen. Analysts have been increasing their estimates, but many of them don't have the iWatch built into their models. She thinks Apple could sell 60 million iWatches in its first year on the market. When the iWatch comes out, she believes analysts will jack their estimates and the stock will follow those estimate increases.  In 2012, Apple's executive class was basically the same group that had been there for a while, with a few holes here and there. Today, it has a mix of new executives, and older executives in new roles. Consider the following changes. Basically, what we have here is some fresh blood. And we have a team that Tim Cook put in place to execute his strategy for the company. R&amp;D spending doesn't necessarily mean much. For instance, Microsoft outspends Apple when it comes to R&amp;D, and we've seen how that's worked out for the two companies. But, as you can see in this chart, there is reason to believe that the increase in R&amp;D spending will lead to a new product. Morgan StanleyR&D spending suggests something big is coming. Sure, everyone is focused on the big $3 billion purchase of Beats. But Apple has made a number of smaller acquisitions. Since the release of the iPhone 5, Apple has made 29 acquisitions.  In the first three quarters of fiscal 2014, Apple spend $898 million buying companies. Over a two-year span, from 2010 to 2012, Apple spent $820 million on acquisitions. Presumably, Apple infusion of talent and product will bolster whatever it's releasing this fall and in the years to come. After the iPhone came out, Apple's sky high gross margins crashed going to 37%, down from a record high of 47.4%. As the margin collapsed, investors feared it would never end. However, Apple's margins have stabilized, and Huberty believes they will survive this product cycle. Benedict EvansMargins fell, but are stable and even ticking up a little. Here's what happened with the iPhone 5, per Huberty: "In September 2012, Apple introduced the iPhone 5 with a new form factor, which increased warranty expenses and suffered severe supply constraints initially, all hurting its gross margins. In October, the company also introduced the new iPad Mini and lowered the price of the 2nd-generation 9.7 iPad by $100, both of which we believe was margin dilutive to the company at low- to mid-20s gross margins." Since then, Apple has raised the price of the iPad Mini with a retina display. It rolled out the 5C at a high price, which protected the margin. She believes Apple may raise pricing for the iPhone 6, and if not, its mix of components should protect the margin.  Further, she thinks the iWatch will have something like a 40% margin, which will help Apple.  Apple's app business is booming right now, which is offsetting the decline in iTunes revenue. Apple has hired the Beats team to fix its iTunes problem and compete with Spotify. Here are some charts from Ben Schachter at Macquarie Research that shows app store sales and growth: MacquarieMacquarie Huberty thinks Apple can increase revenue from users from software and services: "We estimate Apple currently generates about $1 of revenue per month per user. For comparison, streaming content apps like Beats Music, Spotify, and Netflix cost $8-10 per month. Each additional $1 per month per user would add five points of revenue growth and $0.57 of EPS annually." Other possibilities for the future include using the fingerprint scanner, a wireless technology called NFC, and iBeacons to create a new mobile-shopping service.  You can see why Huberty thinks it's going to be different this time. As a parting shot, here is a look at what Apple's stock has done historically after a new iPhone launches. The stock collapsed during the Great Recession, and during the iPhone 5 launch. Otherwise, it's always been up. So, in a way, things will be different, but really the same as they've always been. Morgan Stanley FREE AppDownload
Reuters/Julien MuguetElizabeth Arden isn't thanking JB this quarter.Shares of Elizabeth Arden were down as much as 24% on Tuesday, and the culprit is a familiar pop culture figure: Justin Bieber. In the fourth quarter, Elizabeth Arden's sales fell 28.4% from last year to $191.7 million. Expectations were for revenue to come in at $241.64 million, which would have been a decline of just less than 10%. Arden said sales were weaker than expected because of a steeper than anticipated decline in the sale of its Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift fragrances.  In its earnings press release, the Elizabeth Arden said: "While the Company had expected weaker sales comparisons due to the lower level of fragrance launch activity in fiscal 2014 versus fiscal 2013, the decline in sales of celebrity fragrances, particularly the Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift fragrances, was steeper than anticipated. The inventory destocking at a number of non-prestige customers that impacted the Company’s 2014 third fiscal quarter results continued through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 and led the Company’s shipments to be below the rate of retail sales." For its fiscal year 2014, sales fell 13.4% to $1.164 billion, more than the roughly 10% decline that was expected by analysts. And excluding the pre-market decline in shares of Arden on Tuesday, the stock was down more than 44% year-to-date as of the close on Monday afternoon.  Arden said that fiscal 2014 would be "focused on stabilizing the business and will be the first year of a multiyear plan to rebuild profitability." The company said, however, that in the first quarter it would still be "challenged by the same factors that affected recent quarters." So Bieber isn't going anywhere. FREE AppDownload
Money goes further in some states than others. The Tax Foundation released a map, via Elliot Turner, showing the relative value of $100 in every state compared with the national average using the data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. In expensive states like New York, you can afford comparatively less than average; while in less expensive states like Mississippi, you can buy relatively more. If you look at the map, you'll notice that the relative value of $100 is higher in the center of the country, while it is significantly less in the Northeast and West Coast. "The same amount of dollars are worth almost 40 percent more in Mississippi than in D.C., and the differences become even larger if metro area prices are considered instead of statewide averages," writes the Tax Foundation. "A person who makes $40,000 a year after tax in Kentucky would need to have after-tax earnings of $53,000 in Washington, D.C., just in order to have an equal standard of living, let alone feel richer." Here's the map: Tax Foundation The states with the smallest relative value of $100 were: While the states with the largest relative value of $100 were:    FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersThe Lehman Brothers building is pictured in New YorkBy Steve Slater LONDON (Reuters) - More than 2,400 former Lehman Brothers bankers based in Britain will have their pensions paid in full after winning a six-year battle to receive their money from parts of the collapsed U.S. investment bank. The remains of the bankrupt Lehman group will stump up 184 million pounds ($306 million) so the pensions can be paid in full under a deal brokered by Britain's pensions regulator and announced on Tuesday. The deal works out at an average pension of 75,000 pounds ($124,700) for each of the 2,466 members of the scheme. Lehman Brothers collapsed in September 2008 in the highest-profile failure of a bank during the financial crisis. Thousands of Lehman Brothers' staff had their wealth tied up in the Wall Street bank, which had long encouraged a high degree of share ownership among employees. The Pensions Regulator said the agreement marked its biggest ever win and avoids the need to put the pension scheme into the Pension Protection Fund, which can pay compensation to pension scheme members when a company collapses. The regulator had said that companies within the Lehman group should provide the cash to meet the UK pension plan's liabilities. The case has been tied up in court since, partly because various Lehman operations had made claims on the leftover assets. The administrators of Lehman Brothers' European arm said it would fund the pensions promised under the scheme after receiving "significant" contributions from other parts of the group. It said the pension benefits are likely to be secured under a bulk annuity policy with an insurance company in the future. Creditors of Lehman Brothers' European arm have been paid in full after the carve up of the bank's carcass.  (Editing by David Goodman) FREE AppDownload
Business Insider, St. Louis FedGDP growth.The U.S. economy is still sputtering. (See GDP growth chart above.) Why is growth so slow and weak? One reason is that average American consumers, who account for the vast majority of the spending in the economy, are still strapped. The reason average American consumers are still strapped, meanwhile, is that America's companies and company owners — the small group of Americans who own and control America's corporations — are hogging a record percentage of the country's wealth for themselves. In the past five years, American corporations have boosted their profits and share prices by cutting costs (firing people) and buying back stock. As a result, unemployment remains high. And wage growth for the Americans who are lucky enough to be working has been pathetic — the slowest since World War II. Meanwhile, America's corporations and their owners have never had it better. Corporate profits just hit another all-time high, both in absolute dollars and as a percent of the economy. And U.S. stocks are at record highs. Even Scrooge would be appalled.Many people seem confused by this juxtaposition. If corporations and shareholders are doing so well, why is the economy so crappy? The answer is that one company's wages are other companies' revenues. Americans save almost nothing, so every dollar we earn in wages gets spent on products and services (including, in some cases, those of the companies we work for). The less that American companies pay their workers, the less American consumers have to spend. And the less American consumers have to spend, the slower the economy grows. This isn't a complex concept. We're all in this together. People make it complicated by casting it as a political issue and inflaming partisan tensions. But it has nothing to do with politics. Importantly, it doesn't have to be this way. There's no "law of capitalism" that says that companies have to pay their employees as little as possible. There's no law of capitalism that says companies have to "maximize short-term profits." That's just a story that America's owners made up to justify taking as much of the company's wealth as possible for themselves. Ironically, this short-term greed on the part of America's owners is most likely reducing their long-term wealth: Companies can't grow profits by cutting costs forever, because their profits can't grow higher than their revenues. At some point, revenue growth needs to accelerate. But that won't happen until companies start sharing more of the wealth they create with the folks who create it — their employees. Let's go to the charts ... 1) Corporate profit margins just hit another all-time high. Companies are making more per dollar of sales than they ever have before. (Some people are still blaming economic weakness on "too much regulation" and "too many taxes." That's crap. Maybe little companies are getting smothered by regulation and taxes, but big ones certainly aren't. What they're suffering from is a myopic obsession with short-term profits at the expense of long-term value creation.) Business Insider, St. Louis FedProfits as a percent of the economy.2) Wages as a percent of the economy just hit another all-time low. Why are corporate profits so high? One reason is that companies are paying employees less than they ever have as a share of GDP. And that, in turn, is one reason the economy is so weak: Those "wages" represent spending power for consumers. And consumer spending is "revenue" for other companies. So the profit obsession is actually starving the rest of the economy of revenue growth.

Thomson ReutersA trader walks inside the trading hall during afternoon trading at the Hong Kong Stock ExchangeHONG KONG (Reuters) - Offshore investors are rallying behind China's undervalued equities by plowing billions of dollars into Hong Kong's exchange-traded funds denominated in the yuan currency. As a scheme to allow more foreign inflows into Chinese stocks draws near, fund managers are wagering on a sustained rebound for the Shanghai Composite Index &lt;.SSEC&gt; after a prolonged four-year slump has opened up opportunities to buy on the cheap. "There were some switchings from markets where fund managers had gained positive returns to places that they thought there could be more opportunities, and China was be one of them," said Jackie Choy, an ETF strategist at researcher Morningstar. ETFs under the Renminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (RQFII) posted significant net inflows of 8.2 billion yuan ($1.33 billion) last month, the highest since December 2012 and nearly doubling from June, according to Morningstar data. The majority of the net inflows went into the CSOP FTSE China A50 ETF &lt;82822.HK&gt;&lt;2822.HK&gt;, which attracted an estimated 6.8 billion yuan, followed by the Bosera FTSE China A50 Index ETF &lt;82832.HK&gt;&lt;2832.HK&gt;, which drew an estimated 2.4 billion yuan. A strengthening of the Chinese currency, which has gained 2 percent from 18-month lows hit in April this year, and a recovering economy, have also helped draw foreigners to these ETFs, analysts say. Launched in 2011, RQFII enables financial institutions to use offshore yuan to invest in the mainland's securities markets. Foreign investors, who cannot directly invest in mainland equities, have eagerly embraced the QFII and RQFII schemes to tap China's onshore market. Chinese equity markets were among the worst performers in the first half of this year. The Shanghai Composite Index &lt;.SSEC&gt; dropped 3.2 percent, while the U.S. market was up 7 percent during the same period. However, the A-share index has rebounded by nearly 10 percent in the past month as investors prepared for the launch of the stock connect that is set to make a debut in October and speculate on price convergence of dual-listed shares. A-shares are generally only available for purchase by mainland residents. Stock connect would allow mainland investors to trade shares in designated companies listed in Hong Kong, and at the same time let Hong Kong investors buy shares in Shanghai-listed firms.   EXHAUSTED QUOTAS Thanks to this surge in fund flows, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has had to intervene in the foreign exchange market in recent weeks to protect the Hong Kong dollar's currency peg with the U.S. dollar. The total injection of funds was around HK$75 billion ($9.68 billion) since July 1, a large chunk of it due to capital inflows into markets. "Market sentiment has started to change in the past two to three weeks and fund managers are no longer that pessimistic about China," Norman Chan, chief executive at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, told reporters last Tuesday. Chan was referring to the recent economic data suggesting China may have arrested a sharp loss of momentum at the start of the year. The increased appetite has also seen RQFII quotas being exhausted quickly in the past few months, prompting fund mangers to apply for fresh quotas from China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE). "We've been asking for new quotas almost every month since April and so far more than 99 percent of our mutual fund quota worth of 42.6 billion yuan has been used up," said a person with direct knowledge of RQFII business at CSOP Asset Management. CSOP is the largest RQFII manager with a quota of 44.6 billion yuan as of end-July. Its FTSE China A50 ETF saw a record high daily trading volume of HK$3.7 billion on August 1, topping all stocks and ETFs listed in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Shenzhen. China has approved a total of 257.6 billion yuan RQFII quotas to 72 asset managers by the end of July, accounting for more than 95 percent of the 270 billion yuan quota the former British colony was granted, according to SAFE statistics.   (1 US dollar = 6.1498 Chinese yuan) (1 US dollar = 7.7507 Hong Kong dollar)   (Reporting by Michelle Chen; Editing by Shri Navaratnam) FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Amir Cohen The SCF Altai tanker has anchored near Israel's Ashkelon port June 20, 2014.DUHOK Iraq/ANKARA (Reuters) - The capacity of Iraqi Kurdistan's independent oil pipeline will almost double to at least 200,000 barrels per day by the end of this month, increasing the semi-autonomous region's exports and revenue, industry sources and officials said. Oil revenues are a lifeline for the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG) in northern Iraq, whose peshmerga forces are being supported by U.S. air strikes in their battle against the radical Sunni militants of Islamic State. "Work to increase the capacity will probably be completed by the end of this month. Once it is completed, pumping can increase to up to 220,000 barrels per day (bpd)," one Turkish official told Reuters. Industry sources also said the capacity of the pipeline, which began operating at the start of this year, was set to rise to around 200,000-220,000 bpd from 100,000-120,000 bpd before the flow stopped for upgrade work. The KRG began independently exporting its crude via the Turkish Mediterranean export terminal of Ceyhan in May, a move that has infuriated Baghdad, which claims the sole authority to manage Iraqi oil. Baghdad has tried to block KRG's oil sales and prevented some cargoes from discharging through legal action, but the Kurdish enclave has managed to load seven export cargoes from Ceyhan, according to Turkish Energy Minister Taner Yildiz. So far, 7.8 million barrels of Kurdish oil have flowed through the independent pipeline, of which 6.5 million have been loaded onto tankers for export.  (Reporting by Humeyra Pamuk and Orhan Coskun; Editing by Nick Tattersall and Jane Baird) FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersA view of the Goldman Sachs stall on the floor of the New York Stock ExchangeLONDON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs &lt;gs.n&gt; and Libya's sovereign wealth fund are set to meet in a London court over claims the Wall Street bank exploited a position of trust by encouraging the fund to invest more than $1 billion in trades that ended up worthless. Goldman had filed a summary judgment application - a request to decide a claim without going to trial - in the case brought by the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA) in January, but has recently withdrawn it, the LIA said in a statement. "Following the serving of the LIA's reply evidence, Goldman Sachs has withdrawn its summary judgment application," the LIA said. A case management hearing has now been scheduled for early October. Goldman did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson previously described the claims as without merit and said the bank would defend them vigorously. The LIA brought a lawsuit to London's High Court over a series of equity trades executed between January and April 2008 that expired as worthless in 2011. The fund, which became a Goldman client in 2007, alleges that the bank deliberately exploited the relationship of trust and confidence it had established with LIA staff, causing the fund to enter into the disputed trades. The LIA estimates that Goldman made substantial profit of around $350 million on the trades, while it was left with "colossal" losses.

BAKOKO / FlickrResidential construction activity in the U.S. is bouncing back. The pace of housing starts jumped 15.7% to a 1.093 million unit rate in July, smashing expectations for a pace of 965,000. Permits jumped 8.1% to 1.052 million. Economists were expecting a pace of 1.052 million. Demand for single-family units was up, but demand for multi-family units continues to boom. Building permits for structures with five or more units (e.g. apartment buildings) jumped 23.6%. Starts surged 33.0%. All of this confirms Monday's better-than-expected NAHB housing market sentiment report. “As the employment picture brightens, builders are seeing a noticeable increase in the number of serious buyers entering the market,” said the NAHB's Kevin Kelly.

Flickr/walkadogHot air balloon on Prospect Lake in Colorado Springs, ColoradoCore inflation rose 0.1% month-over-month in July, a slight miss from what 0.2% increase economists had been expecting.  Headline CPI, which includes all items, also rose 0.1% over last month and 2% over last year, right in-line with expectations. This reading marks the lowest increase for the headline index since February.   Over last year, core inflation rose 1.9%, in-line with expectations. Expectations were for "Core" CPI, which excludes food and gas — which tend to be more volatile — to rise 0.2% over last month and 1.9% over last year. Looking at some of the reports sub-indexes, energy prices fell 0.3% in July compared to the prior month, the first month-on-month decline since March, as each component of the energy component fell over the prior month.  The food sub-index rose 0.4% month-over-month, which the BLS notes is the fifth time in the last six month that food prices have increased by at least that much. In the last year, the index for meat, poultry, fish, and eggs has increased 7.6%. The price of dairy and related products is also up 4.3% in the last 12 months. Following the report, Ian Shepherdson at Pantheon Macro said, "In one line: Unthreatening, but rents are gathering momentum."  Shepherdson added that, "Overall, a non-threatening report, but watch the pick-up in rents, with primary up 3.3% y/y and OER up 2.7%, fastest since '09 and '08 respectively and trending up, thanks to the continued decline in rental vacancies." CPI isn't the Fed's preferred measure of inflation — that would be the personal consumption expenditures, or PCE report — but with both metrics remaining well below the Fed's 2% target, the central bank hasn't been pressured to raise interest rates.  FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersTraders stand outside the New York Stock Exchange prior to the opening bellBy Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures advanced modestly on Tuesday, putting the S&amp;P 500 on track for a second straight day of gains, after solid earnings from Home Depot and ahead of data on inflation and the housing market. Dow component Home Depot  gained 3.3 percent to $86.31 in premarket trade after the world's largest home improvement retailer reported earnings and revenue that topped Wall Street expectations and raised its full-year profit forecast. Investors will eye housing starts and the consumer price index data for July scheduled for release at 8:30 a.m. (1230 GMT). Housing starts are expected to show an increase to a seasonally adjusted annual 969,000 unit-pace versus the 893,000 pace in June. CPI is expected to show a 0.1 percent increase versus the 0.3 percent rise in the prior month. The S&amp;P 500  closed at its highest level since July 28 to move within 1 percent of a record high and the Nasdaq  finished at its highest since March 2000 on Monday, buoyed by increasing homebuilder confidence, a flurry of M&amp;A activity and hopes for easing tensions in Ukraine. But sparks of conflict remained in the region, with fighting taking place on Tuesday in the center of Luhansk, near Ukraine's border with Russia, between government forces and separatist rebels who have held the town since April, a Ukrainian military spokesman said. S&amp;P 500 e-mini futures  were up 2.75 points and fair value - a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract - indicated a higher open. Dow Jones industrial average e-mini futures  rose 37 points and Nasdaq 100 e-mini futures  added 7.25 points. U.S.-listed shares of BHP Billiton , down 3.5 percent to $70.20 and BHP Billiton PLC , off 5.3 percent to $65.81, lost ground in premarket after the world's biggest mining company announced plans to spin off businesses worth an estimated $16 billion but held off on a share buyback plan. China Finance Online  jumped 13.9 percent to $8.91 before the opening bell after the company said it had launched China's first independent web-based securities trading platform. European shares rose to extend the previous session's rally, while Asian shares tracked Wall St gains, driven by what traders saw as an easing of tension in the Ukraine crisis.

FacebookFacebook Messenger has been downloaded over 500m times on Android devices world wide, according to the Google Play Store. Despite user backlash over Facebook’s controversial policy to force users to install the separate Messenger app to continuing using Facebook chat on a smartphone or tablet, it joins the list of apps that have been downloaded more than 500m times. Currently only Google’s own apps such as Gmail and YouTube, Facebook’s primary app and WhatsApp, which the social network bought in February, and Messenger have been downloaded more than 500m times. No app has yet been downloaded over 1bn times, despite there being over 1 billion monthly Android users globally as of July, according to data from Google. Facebook Messenger on Android was criticized for the extensive number of permissions it required on install, giving it access to the majority of a smartphone’s features, data and connectivity, prompting privacy invasion fears. The backlash by users prompted the social network to post an explanation of why its Messenger app requires access to audio recordings, photos and videos, phone numbers, read text messages and contacts, out of the 30-plus permissions the app demands on install on Android. Despite user anger over being forced to install the app to continue chatting on Facebook, the Android Facebook Messenger app is faring better with customer reviews than the less than 2-star iPhone app, maintaining 4 stars from just under 8m ratings. • How to avoid installing Facebook Messenger on an iPhone and continue chatting This article originally appeared on guardian.co.uk  FREE AppDownload
Chris Hondros/Getty ImagesMaking money in the market is as simple as sitting back and buying the dips. Jeff Saut of Raymond James offers some commentary on how "easy" it is to trade the market right now. It's basically this simple: When stocks go down, you buy the dip. Voila. 'Can it be that easy?' is a question I asked a portfolio manager (PM) during my recent institutional accounts visit to NYC. He asked me, 'What do you mean?' I responded, 'Can it be that easy as to buy the S&amp;P 500 (SPX/1955) any time it pulls back 5%?' He stated, 'It hasn't been that easy during my 35-year tenure in this business, but that has certainly been the correct trading strategy since the June 2012 low.' And two weeks ago, with the S&amp;P 500 off 4.4% from its intraday high to intraday low (1991 to 1904), that was again the preferred strategy of professional traders as they were sneaking large 'buy orders' into the markets right on the closing bell. At the same time the Commitment of Traders' report (COT) showed a marked decline in professional traders' 'short sales.' The inference was the 'pros' were betting this was going to be another garden variety 5%-7% decline before the uptrend resumes. In our discussions in preparation for this month's edition of Gleanings, Andrew Adams noted, 'Since I tend to be a trend follower, I am inclined to buy the 5%-7% dips until the strategy stops working.' Indeed, in case you have not been paying attention, after tanking at the end of last month the Dow is almost back to its new highs. FinViz  FREE AppDownload

REUTERS/Youssef Boudlal Kurdish peshmerga forces near the town of Makhmur, south of Irbil, capital of Iraqi Kurdistan, on Monday after Islamic State (IS) insurgents withdrew. Good morning! Here's what you need to know: Remember The Sell-Off? The global markets are extending their big comeback from their lows of the month. In Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 is up 0.5%, France's CAC 40 is up 0.3%, Germany's DAX is up 0.9%, and Spain's IBEX is up 0.4%. Asia closed higher, with Japan's Nikkei up 0.8% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng up 0.6%. U.S. futures are pointing to another up day. Dow futures are up 31 points, and S&amp;P 500 futures are up 3 points. "The S&amp;P 500 has recovered all of the 65 point fall from July 31 to August 7," wrote Societe Generale's Kit Juckes. "‘Risk’ is ‘on’ again by that measure, and if you include press reports of large fund managers buying U.S. junk debt, or look at falling volatility, tighter spreads more generally." Investors Are Tired Of Worrying. That's how stock market guru Ed Yardeni explains the series of modest market dips as opposed to big 10% corrections. "Often in the past, I’ve noted that the current bull market has been marked by a series of “endgame” corrections followed by relief rallies to new cyclical highs, and then new record highs since March 28, 2013," he wrote. "I also noted that at the start of 2013, when the widely dreaded fiscal cliff was averted, our accounts showed symptoms of anxiety fatigue. They were tired of worrying about endgame scenarios. That might explain why there have been dips rather than corrections since early 2013." Good News Out Of Home Depot. The home improvement chain reported Q2 comparable store sales jumped 5.8%, which was stronger than the 4.4% growth expected. Earnings of $1.52 per share beat expectations for $1.44. "In the second quarter, our spring seasonal business rebounded, and we saw strong performance in the core of the store and across all of our geographies," said CEO Frank Blake. Management's full-year earnings outlook was also ahead of analysts' expectations. Good News Out Of Maersk. Danish shipping behemoth Maersk announced Q2 revenue and earnings beat expectations, driven by a 6.6% increase in volume. Management sees global container demand up 4% to 5% year-over-year. Shipping activity tends to be a reliable bellwether of global economic activity. British Inflation Cools. U.K. consumer prices fell by 0.3% month-over-month in July, which was worse than the -0.2% expected. On a year-over-year basis, CPI climbed by just 1.6% year-over-year, missing expectations for 1.8% growth. All of this gives the Bank of England room to keep monetary policy loose for longer. We'll Soon Hear About US Inflation. At 8:30 a.m., we'll get the July U.S. consumer price index report. Economists estimate CPI climbed by 0.1% month-over-month or 2.0% year-over-year. Excluding food and energy, core CPI is estimated to have climbed by 0.2% or 1.9%, respectively. Here's Morgan Stanley's Ted Wieseman: "Lower retail gasoline prices and lower utility rates as natural gas prices extended a sharp reversal of winter elevation point to lower energy prices. Food prices were flat in June after surges averaging 0.4% from March to May, but farm prices and PPI pointed to renewed upside concentrated in meats. Core inflation, meanwhile, should continue to be boosted by a gradual acceleration in shelter costs. Taken together, rent and owners’ equivalent rent, accounting for 40% of core CPI, were at a six-year high of 2.8% year/year in June, up from 2.6% in December and 2.4% in June 2013, and a plunge in the national rental vacancy rate to a twenty- year low in Q2 points to further upside going forward. Otherwise, a decline new car prices restrained core CPI in June, but industry sources estimated lower sales incentives in July. Industry figures also pointed to more stable hotel rates after a 1.9% pullback in June reversed a 2.0% rise in May, and airlines have seen continued strength in domestic revenues." Aeropostale CEO Is Out. The casual apparel retailer announced that Thomas Johnson would be stepping down as CEO after three and a half years and that former CEO Julian Geiger would return. During Johnson's tenure, the company's stock price has fallen by around 85%, and profit margins have fallen by half. Standard Chartered Nearing Deal Over Compliance Failure. "Standard Chartered Plc is close to a deal to pay between $200 million and $300 million to resolve allegations by New York’s banking regulator that it failed to review high-risk transactions, two years after agreeing to reform its practices, a person familiar with the matter said on Monday," reported Reuters' Karen Freifeld. "The announcement of the settlement could come this week, possibly as soon as Tuesday, according to the person, who was not authorized to speak about the talks and declined to be identified." Sprint Cuts Prices And Doubles Data Offerings. "Sprint Corp on Monday unveiled a new pricing plan that offers customers 20 gigabytes of data and up to 10 lines for $100, doubling its data offerings, the latest in a string of price cuts and promotions sweeping the wireless industry," reported Reuters' Marina Lopes and Carey Gillam. "Sprint's chairman, business tycoon Masayoshi Son, is betting new prices will revive a carrier hampered by an expensive network overhaul and rising competition." BofA's Tom Montag Becomes Sole COO. "Bank of America Corp.’s Thomas K. Montag, the lender’s top-paid senior manager, will become sole chief operating officer as co-COO David Darnell takes a new title so he can move to Florida," reported Bloomberg's Hugh Son. "Darnell, 61, will be vice chairman and continue overseeing global wealth and investment management, as well as business banking, Chief Executive Officer Brian T. Moynihan wrote in a memo to employees. Montag, who has split the COO job with Darnell since 2011, will still run the investment banking and capital markets businesses." FREE AppDownload
AFPThe mega-resort is being developed on land previously owned by Allen Stanford, who was convicted of running a massive Ponzi scheme.Chinese investors are to plunge more than US$1 billion into developing Antigua and Barbuda’s first mega-resort, creating 1,000 jobs for the tiny cash-strapped nation. Construction on the mammoth 1,600-acre (647-hectare) multi-hotel, residential and commercial project is slated to begin early next year. The 'Singulari' scheme -- 50 per cent bigger than the regionally-heralded Baha Mar resort under way in the Bahamas -- is being lauded as a major feather in the East Caribbean country's tourism cap. Spanning 900 acres of land in the north of Antigua and 700 acres of tiny islands, it will include several luxury hotels, hundreds of private homes, a school, hospital, marinas, golf courses, an entertainment district, horse racing track and the Caribbean’s biggest casino. It is being created on land previously owned by disgraced US financier Allen Stanford, once Antigua’s largest employer. Sam Dyson, of Luxury Locations real estate agency which introduced Beijing-based Yida International Investment Group to the island in May 2013 and negotiated the deal with the land’s liquidators, said: "Singulari will provide Antigua and Barbuda with an economic boost and galvanize the destination as a tourism force to be reckoned with." A Yida spokesman said job fairs would be held within weeks to ensure locals were given first priority for the 200 positions being made available later this year when the land is prepared for development, and the 800 created next year when construction starts. "Over the next 10 years, Yida Group and its global partners will create an additional US$2 billion of gross domestic product and economic value to Antigua, including sales of real estate, creation of new industries and origination of foreign direct investment," he added. Antiguan Prime Minister Gaston Browne signed a memorandum of agreement with the developers on June 13, one day after taking office following June’s general election. Browne declared his intention to transform the country, suffering crippling national debt and unemployment, into an economic powerhouse. With national debt at almost 90 percent of GDP, the main challenges for the new government will include reviving the 108-square mile (280-square kilometer) country's tourism-dependent economy. Financial woes have been exacerbated by fallout from Texas businessman Stanford's US$7 billion Ponzi scheme. A citizen of Antigua and Barbuda, Stanford was the private sector's biggest employer before his arrest in 2009. Copyright (2014) AFP. All rights reserved.  FREE AppDownload
AFP Photo/Boris HorvatArtists, technicians, and part-time workers employed in the entertainment industry demonstrate in Marseille, southern France, on June 16, 2014, to protest against government cuts to their unemployment benefits.A stagnant economy, ballooning deficit, and sniping from within his own party ranks — President Francois Hollande faces a mountain of problems when French political life restarts after the long summer holidays. The government on Wednesday will hold its first cabinet meeting of what is known as the political "rentree," or return from holidays, just a week after the finance minister admitted the economy had "broken down," with zero growth over the past six months. Prime Minister Manuel Valls had already warned the autumn months would be "difficult," with France's unemployment at a record high and the European Union increasingly worried about the country's budget deficit. The government was forced to slash this year's growth forecast in half to 0.5 percent after figures showed the economy failed to grow in the second quarter after stagnating in the first three months. AFP Photo/Charles PlatiauPresident Francois Hollande's personal poll ratings are still close to historic lows."We have growth that is far too weak, in France and in Europe," complained Valls after a meeting with Hollande to prepare the ground for September. Adding to Hollande's economic problems, France appears to be spiralling down into a deflationary cycle because of a lack of activity, with prices actually slipping backward last month. "What the French are desperately waiting for are solutions or, if possible, results. But they can't see either of those things," fumed an editorial in the center-left Le Monde daily. "For the head of state, the challenge is considerable ... he has to come up with answers. No matter what the political risk." Hollande's main response to France's economic plight also experienced a major setback during the holiday months, as the Constitutional Court slapped down part of his "Responsibility Pact," which he hoped would create jobs and kick-start the economy. The court rejected a key plank of the reform that would reduce social charges for low-income employees, dashing hopes of sparking consumption by putting more money in workers' pockets. But Valls insisted: "Yes, the policies that the president has put in place will take time to produce results, but there is no question of changing course." A survey by polling institute IFOP in the Journal du Dimanche showed that more than eight in 10 French people had no confidence in the government when it came to economic growth, reducing the deficit, or fighting unemployment. Hollande's personal poll ratings are still close to historic lows, despite a small uptick in recent months. "There is an extremely strong sense of mistrust, of worry, of defeatism in the face of the crisis," IFOP analyst Frederic Dabi told AFP. "The presidency has broken down, and we're only in the middle of the five-year term." Capping what left-leaning daily Liberation called an "Augustus horribilis" for Hollande, a top member of his own socialist party, Martine Aubry, launched a vicious broadside at the French leader over plans to change the country's regional boundaries. "For the past two years, in all areas, if we had had some vision and a method, we would have had fewer problems," Aubry said. The plan to redraw the map of France, cutting the number of regions to 13 from 22, is likely to be one of the most controversial political issues of the autumn. The radical left party, a small coalition partner with one minister and two junior ministers in Hollande's cabinet, has threatened to resign from the government if it is "not heard" on the issue of regional reform. And lurking in the wings is political rival Nicolas Sarkozy, who has vowed to decide in the coming months whether he will re-enter French politics. Beset with legal difficulties, the center-right former president has been weighing up whether to stand for the leadership of his embattled UMP party. However, some analysts suggest a Sarkozy return could even prove to be a boon for Hollande as the president might benefit from going up against such a divisive figure. "Nicolas Sarkozy is the best opponent Francois Hollande could dream of for the next presidential election" due in 2017, political analyst Stephane Rozes, told AFP. Sarkozy is "embroiled in legal difficulties, and every time he comments on an issue, he splits his own camp." Copyright (2014) AFP. All rights reserved.  FREE AppDownload
The British pound dropped to $1.663 from around $1.671 moments ago. The move followed a new inflation report that showed U.K. consumer prices fell by 0.3% month-over-month in July, which was worse than the -0.2% expected. On a year-over-year basis, CPI climbed by just 1.6% year-over-year, missing expectations for 1.8% growth. "Disinflationary tailwinds from sterling appreciation should push down on the headline rate in months to come," wrote Bloomberg economists Jamie Murray, Niraj Shah, and David Powell. "In this environment, it would take a sustained burst of above-trend wage growth for inflation to gain significant traction — an unlikely prospect." The cooler than expected inflation levels gives the Bank of England more flexibility to keep monetary policy loose and interest rates lower for longer, all things being equal.

International banks are making contingency plans for a massive exit from Britain if the country ever votes to leave the European Union in a referendum, the Financial Times reports. Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley are all eyeing a move to Ireland, the paper reports. Those reports come on the heels of news that banks are preparing to leave Scotland if that country's independence vote goes the "wrong" way on Sept. 18 — setting up an historic, bizarre double-exit scenario for Europe banks. So far, banks are only considering contingencies. The Bank of England, for instance, said it will do whatever it has to do if the Scots go it alone. Nothing concrete is in place, yet. A Scottish exit could cost the Northern nation 9% of its GDP from fleeing banks, according to the National Institute of Social and Economic Research. A British exit could cost the U.K. 12% of its tax base, the FT says. About 250 banks have office in the U.K., mostly London, and the E.U. gives them equal, unfettered access across the borders of 27 European countries. But Prime minister David Cameron has promised to hold a referendum on whether the U.K. should leave Europe if the Conservatives win the next election in May 2015. If Britain leaves the EU, all its companies will suddenly potentially become subject to new border restrictions, taxes and tariffs in other European countries — putting a significant drag on trade and exchange. If the U.K. were to leave the EU – the so-called “Brexit” scenario – senior bankers worry that Britain would be unable to negotiate the same passporting rights for its financial services industry. If these were lost, it would force many corporate and investment banking operations to leave the UK. The hit to the U.K. economy could be huge: £27 billion ($45 billion) in taxes: It is hard to argue with the importance of the financial services industry to the UK. According to the Treasury, the industry provided 1.4m jobs and paid £27.5bn in income tax and national insurance in 2011-12, or 12 per cent of the total. The International Monetary Fund says the UK is the largest net exporter of financial services, insurance and pensions in the world, with a trade surplus of $67bn in those industries. A third of that surplus came from trading with the EU. At the same time, the Scots are preparing to vote on whether they leave the U.K. (and technically Europe too, at least temporarily). A televised debate on Scottish independence will be held Monday evening. Read the FT's story on banks preparing to leave London here. FREE AppDownload

REUTERS/Aly Song Stock market bulls are beating bears this week.Stocks rallied for the second straight day as housing data on Tuesday morning came in better than expected while inflation data was in-line with expectations. First, the scoreboard: And now, the top stories on Tuesday: 1. The pace of housing starts rose 15.7% to an annualized pace of 1.093 million units in July, beating expectations for a pace of 965,000. Permits increased 8.1% to a rate of 1.052 million, which was in-line with expectations. Ian Shepherdson at Pantheon Macroeconomics had a mixed read on the report. "In one line: Startling headline gains but underlying trend in core single-family is much less exciting," Shepherdson said. "In the single-family sector activity has returned to its pre-winter level but permits are starting to level off again. With the stock of homes for sale well above its cycle lows, price gains slowing and new home sales flat, it is hard to see why construction would keep rising."  2. The latest consumer price index, or CPI, report from the BLS showed that "core" inflation, which strips out food and gas, rose just 0.1% month-over-month in July, slower than the 0.2% that was expected by economists. Headline CPI, which includes food and fas, rose just 0.1% month-over-month, the slowest increase for the headline index since February. On a year-over-year basis, core CPI was up 2% and the headline reading was up 1.9%, with both readings in-line with expectations. Following the report, Paul Dales at Capital Economics said, "The recent softening in U.S. core prices eases some of the pressure on the Fed to start considering rate hikes, although in our view only temporarily." 3. Home improvement giant Home Depot was the biggest gainer on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, gaining 5.5% after reporting same-store sales that grew 5.8% in the second quarter. Home Depot also earned $1.52 per share in the quarter, topping expectations for earnings of $1.44. Home Depot's gain was also good for the second largest percentage gain on the S&amp;P 500.  4. Fragrance maker Elizabeth Arden saw shares get absolutely crush, falling more than 23% after reporting quarterly sales that widely missed expectations. Arden said its sales were impacted by a steeper than expected decline in sales of its celebrity fragrances, including its Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift fragrances. Sales in the quarter also fell 28.4% from the same period a year ago, more than the 10% decline expected by analysts. Arden also said that in the current quarter it expects to be challenged by the same factors that affected recent quarters. 5. Shares of chicken chain El Pollo Loco fell nearly 10% after analysts at Morgan Stanley initiated coverage of the stock with an "Underweight" rating and a $22 price target, saying the newly-public stock has gotten ahead of itself. "The market appears to be paying a premium ... far above what we consider to be fair value — and well above any reasonable peer comparable," wrote analysts John Glass and Jake Bartlett. Glass and Bartlett outlined three cases for how the shares could trade from here: "Pollo en Fuego," "Pollo Bueno," and "Pollo Muertos." 6. Shares of Dick's Sporting Goods were up more than 1% after reporting earnings that beat expectations, though the sporting good retailer said it would take a $20.4 million charge in the second quarter related to its golf business. "We have consolidated our Golf Galaxy merchandising, marketing, and store operations into Dick's Sporting Goods," Dick's CEO Edward Stack said. "In addition, we have eliminated specific staff in our golf area within our Dick's Sporting Goods stores. These changes are necessitated by the current and expected trends in golf."  7.

REUTERS/StringerContainer ship Edith Maersk crosses the Suez Canal at East Port Said Port, 120 km (75 miles) northeast of Cairo, October 5, 2012. Danish shipping and oil conglomerate AP Moeller Maersk raised its full-year profit guidance on Tuesday after quarterly results were boosted by a strong performance by its container shipping business. It also said it would return about $1.0 billion (749 million euros) to shareholders over the next year through a share-buyback programme. The group, which has about 15 percent of the global container market through Maersk Line, said profit was expected to be $4.5 billion this year rather than the previously stated $4.0 billion after stripping out discontinued operations, impairment losses and divestment gains. Maersk Line, which accounts for about 40 percent of group revenue, reported a 6.6 percent volume increase and bolstered profits through cost cutting initiatives that included operating ships at a slower speed. Operating profit from the container business rose by a quarter to $547 million as higher volumes and lower costs offset a fall in the average revenue per unit. Freight rates have remained depressed since global shipping companies expanded their capacity just as international trade was hit by the financial crisis. To reduce costs, Maersk announced last month an alliance with shipping company MSC on some of the world's busiest cargo routes after China scuppered a planned tie-up between the two companies and CMA. The alliance will create a system similar to code-sharing agreements among airlines, allowing the companies to put cargo on each others vessels. The group's net profit in the second quarter nearly tripled to $2.304 billion from $856 million, reflecting a $2.8 billion gain from selling its stake in Danish retailer Dansk Supermarked, but also a $1.7 billion writedown on its Brazilian oil assets. Analysts polled by Dow Jones Newswires had expected net profit to reach $2.1 billion. The raised outlook was "greater than expected," Sydbank analyst Jacob Pedersen told Danish news agency Ritzau. "The share buyback will make investors say that now Maersk has really trained its focus on the shareholders," he added. Shares in Maersk were 4.7 percent higher in midday trading on the Copenhagen stock market, where the main index was up by one percent. Copyright (2014) AFP. All rights reserved.  FREE AppDownload
Citi ResearchWorried about a potential recession and another big market decline?  Analysts at Citi say a good way to track this risk is to look at the HY bond spreads.  Specifically, spreads at 600-700 bps indicate a recession is highly probable: Another factor that seems to flag the transition into Phase 4 is the level of HY spreads. It seems that global equities can handle an increase in spreads to around 600-700bp, but anything higher indicates that a recession is imminent. Even given the recent sell-off, spreads are now 400bp. Sure, they may go higher as the withdrawal of US QE allows spreads to recouple with fundamentals, but they are still a long way off the levels that have previously flashed warnings for equity investors. In 2007-08, they very quickly hit this danger level. We’re far from the caution levels at present, but HY spreads can change quickly. This one’s worth keeping an eye on.

Dr. Ed's BlogThere were some hair-raising corrections in the current bull market during 2010, 2011, and 2012. They were triggered by fears of a double dip in the US, the disintegration of the Eurozone, and a hard landing in China. The one during the summer of 2011 was exacerbated by the debt ceiling crisis in Washington, DC. The last correction occurred during the fall of 2012 as investors dreaded going over a “fiscal cliff” in the US, which was averted at the last minute at the start of 2013. However, the selloff wasn’t an “official” correction since the S&amp;P 500 fell 7.7%, short of the 10% decline that is deemed to be a bona fide correction. Since the start of 2013, there have been 10 dips that have retested the 50-day moving average of the S&amp;P 500, as I’ve noted previously. They were mostly triggered by similar concerns as the ones that triggered the earlier corrections. The dip at the beginning of this year was caused by fears of an emerging markets crisis. It lasted just eight trading days, from January 22 to February 3, with the S&amp;P 500 falling 5.6%, the worst dip since the start of 2013. The latest dip started on July 24, when the S&amp;P 500 peaked at a record 1987.98. It seems to have ended on August 7, with the S&amp;P 500 down just 3.9% from its recent peak. After yesterday’s big rally, the stock composite is now only 0.8% below the peak. I have been in the dip camp rather than the correction camp. This downdraft was unusual because it was triggered mostly by geopolitical risks, which have been mostly ignored during the current bull market. Often in the past, I’ve noted that the current bull market has been marked by a series of “endgame” corrections followed by relief rallies to new cyclical highs, and then new record highs since March 28, 2013. I also noted that at the start of 2013, when the widely dreaded fiscal cliff was averted, our accounts showed symptoms of anxiety fatigue. They were tired of worrying about endgame scenarios. That might explain why there have been dips rather than corrections since early 2013. Dr. Ed's BlogToday's Morning Briefing: Another Relief Rally. (1) Corrections followed by dips. (2) Averted “fiscal cliff” led to anxiety fatigue. (3) Ten dips since start of 2013. (4) Good buying opportunities at the 50-dma line. (5) The latest dip was on rising geopolitical risks.

Thomson ReutersRed flags flutter next to a national emblem and a national flag of China on top of the Great Hall of the People, which is the venue of the closing ceremony of the CPPCC, in BeijingTOKYO (Reuters) - Two Japanese automotive bearings makers said on Tuesday a Chinese regulator has ordered them to pay fines for violating antitrust laws as Beijing intensifies its scrutiny of business practices in the auto sector. Earlier this month, the National Development and Reform Commission said the government had completed investigations into 12 Japanese auto parts makers and was preparing to hand out punishment according to the law. Sectors from autos to pharmaceuticals have come under the spotlight as China seeks to tighten compliance with anti-monopoly laws. NSK Ltd  said the regulator issued a 174.9 million yuan ($28.5 million) fine over unspecified violations of the China's antitrust law. Rival NTN Corp  also said the Chinese regulator ordered it to pay a 119.2 million yuan fine. "NSK and its subsidiaries... have taken and will continue to take comprehensive measures with the help of outside experts and others to ensure strict compliance with all applicable laws and regulations," the Tokyo-based company said in a statement. NTN said it would conduct its business while adhering to principles of fair and honest competition. Both companies said should any revisions be made to their profit forecasts for the financial year to March 2015, they would be announced swiftly.

APMasayoshi SonOVERLAND PARK Kan./WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sprint Corp &lt;s.n&gt; on Monday unveiled a new pricing plan that offers customers 20 gigabytes of data and up to 10 lines for $100, doubling its data offerings, the latest in a string of price cuts and promotions sweeping the wireless industry. Sprint's chairman, business tycoon Masayoshi Son, is betting new prices will revive a carrier hampered by an expensive network overhaul and rising competition. "The message is simple: We are back in the game. We are going to offer most competitive value for American consumers," Marcelo Claure, Sprint's newly appointed chief executive told Reuters in an interview. The company will release new plans for individuals later this week. The announcement marks the first move for the new CEO, who last week said cutting prices would be his top priority. The move comes after Verizon slashed prices for its unlimited talk and text plan and T-Mobile expanded its family plan to 6 lines and could signal more price cuts ahead for the industry as a whole. Sprint is going it alone after scuttling a months-long effort to pursue a merger with No. 4 U.S. cellular provider T-Mobile US Inc &lt;tmus.n&gt;. Last year, an aggressive campaign by T-Mobile to address subscriber frustrations and lower prices sparked a domino effect that caused the U.S. top four carriers to restructure pricing plans and cut rates to lure customers in a nearly saturated market. But analysts worry the industry's latest discount spree could increase pressure on already tight margins and rattle dividends. While top carriers AT&amp;T &lt;t.n&gt; and Verizon &lt;vz.n&gt; have largely been able to mitigate the impact of T-Mobile's discounts on their subscriber base, they would likely have to respond to price cuts at Sprint with steep discounts of their own to keep subscribers from migrating, analysts said. "We will see a trickle down in pricing concessions across the industry. This is the start of a price war many anticipated would be coming," said Angelo Zino, analyst at S&amp;P Capital IQ. New pricing plans that charge customers separately for the cost of their devices have somewhat offset price cuts this year, Zino said, but if the discounts continue, they could pose a long-term threat to the dividends. Son, CEO of Sprint's parent company, SoftBank Corp &lt;9984.T&gt;, said earlier this year he wants to start a "massive price war" in the United States and warned that with Claure as CEO price competition will likely heat up. But many question whether Sprint, with $27 billion in net debt according to the company's latest filings is in a financial position to fuel a price war with its competitors. "Do they have the balance sheet? Not really, but the good news is that they have a major investor in SoftBank, so they have the potential to get more aggressive" said Zino.   (Reporting by Marina Lopes in Washington and Carey Gillam in Overland Park, Kansas; editing by G Crosse) FREE AppDownload
