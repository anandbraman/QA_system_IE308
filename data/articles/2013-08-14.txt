Screenshot via Bloomberg TV We've been covering the writing and prognostication of economist David Rosenberg (the economist at Gluskin-Sheff) for years. And though he's been known as a permabear, his real consistent theme is not bearishness, but a belief in an ongoing deflationary or disinflationary trend. And on this measure, he's been dead on. David Rosenberg is a top-caliber economist. Even with the recovery seemingly having gathered pace, the deflation/disinflation call has been dead on. One need only look at the year over year change in core CPI to see that inflation remains at levels that are the lowest in decades. FRED Interest rates also remain incredibly low (by historical standards) though they've come up a bit lately. And again, on this, Rosenberg has been dead on. The question of whether the economy remains in this kind of trend, or finally reverses course is perhaps one of the most crucial questions of this moment. So it's VERY strongly worth noting that David Rosenberg has written a note and slide dek today (which we published at Business Insider) wherein he departs from the deflation camp. His basic argument is that the deflation camp is way too crowded, and that just as Paul Volcker eventually whipped inflation, so too will Bernanke be successful in his anti-deflation drive, and that when you combine that with an economy with less and less capacity "slack" (think the shrinking workforce) it's only time before prices rise again. The whole thing is a must read, and his conclusion is especially strong. So if you are an issuer, the time for refinancing is now, not later. And if you are an investor, donâ€™t spend too long debating whether you should be starting to hedge your portfolio against the prospect of a rising long-Â term interest rate environment, even as central banks continue to keep short-term policy yields at the floor. From the perspective of an economist at a wealth management firm, this means embarking on strategies that over time will effectively hedge out interest rate risk, for example with exposure to hard assets, credit arbitrage, and screening in the equity market for companies with high fixed costs and low variable costs, high ratios of capital to labour, and firms with a proven history of being able to pass on cost increases to protect profit margins.Â  Check out his full article and presentation here &gt;
Ever wonder how cigarette companies can still be in business despite all those seemingly crippling excise taxes and legal settlements?Â  Â A chart from Morgan Stanley helps explain. It shows which packaged consumer goods enjoy the highest operating margins â€” or the ratio of operating income to overall sales. This is a function of how much you can sell a good for versus how much that good costs to produce including any fixed costs. At the top of the food chain: moist, smokeless tobacco (aka dip or chew) at 61%, followed by cigarettes at 41%. Check it out: Morgan Stanley

Deals Amid RIA's Are At A 5-Year Low (The Wall Street Journal) There were just 18 mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) involving registered independent advisors (RIAs) in the first half of 2013, according to Schwab Advisor Services. This totaled $15.4 billion in assets under management (AUM) and was at a five-year low. This is down from 25 deals at $36 billion in AUM in 2012.Â  "Advisors considering ownership transition may be focusing on creating more value in their firm leading them to delay a deal for a few years," Jonathan Beatty at Schwab Advisor Services told the WSJ. The Most Important Attributes Investment Managers Need To Build Client Trust (CFA Institute) The 2013 CFA Institute &amp; Edelman Investor Trust Study finds that investors think that "trusting an investment manager to act in their best interest is the single most important factor in making a hiring decision. Achieving high returns was cited only half as much, and fee amounts or structure only one-fifth." Shown below are the top attributes investment managers need to build client trust. Â  CFA Institute Doug Kass: 10 Reasons The Market has Peaked (The Street) Doug Kass thinks the stock market has peaked for 10 key reasons. 1. "Rising interest rates pose more of a threat to growth than many believe." 2. The U.S. economic recovery is still fragile. " 3. "The economic prospects for China, the straw that stirs the drink of global growth, are uncertain." 4. "An expected 2013 tapering is likely a policy mistake" 5. "The Fed head selection represents a more significant market event than consensus believes." 6. Politics will come center stage again. 7. We are far into this bull market, and the average bull market in the last 60 years has been 43 months, and the longest have been between 56-60 months. 8. "Sector/group leadership changes are typically a negative sign for markets." 9. "Though most indices are within 1% of an all-time high, new peaks have not been confirmed by breadth or by new 52-week highs since mid-July." 10. "Valuations are stretched." Janus Funds Has Its Biggest Monthly Withdrawals In Over Three Years (Bloomberg)  Asset manager Janus Capital Group has its biggest monthly redemptions in over three years. John Groneman, head of investor relations at Janus told Bloomberg that one investor yanked $1.3 billion in July, and overall investors pulled out $2.2 billion.Â  "The redemptions are a function of the underperformance the fund has experienced over the last three years," Groneman told Bloomberg. Janus has been hurt as investors have moved into bonds and passive investments. Janus has 80% of its assets in actively managed stock products. SEC Says Finance Twitterer Was Running A Ponzi, And Using Client Money As His Personal Piggy BankÂ (Business Insider) The SEC has charged Ohio-based hedge fund manager, Anthony Davian, known as @hedgieguy with fraud. The SEC filing accuses Davian of misappropriating "more than $1 million from investors in funds managed by his company." From the filing: "Defendants promote Davian Capital as a highly successful investment firm managing a portfolio of profitable hedge funds. But Davian Capital is nothing more than Davian's personal piggy bank. He has invested only some of his clients' funds. He has used the rest to finance construction of a luxury home for himself, and to buy himself a luxury car, among other things."
George Soros' Q2 2013 13F is out â€” that means we get to see the long positions his family office is holding. Lets get to the stand outs. Soros picked up 66,800 shares of Apple from nothing. In his previous 13F filing, he had no position in the company. He also picked up a massive stake in the flailing retailer, JC Penney, 19,986,361 with a call on 500,000 shares. That means he expected the stock to go up. An interesting development considering that, as we know, Bill Ackman is on the board and Ackman and Soros aren't getting along well these days. And here's one reason why â€” Soros picked up 5,039,175 shares of Herbalife, Bill Ackman's big short. Ackman filed a suit against Soros with the SEC over that buy, accusing him of breaking insider trading laws. Soros also dumped a bunch of Citigroup stock, unlike David Tepper, who picked up the stock in Q2. Soros held 544,500 shares in Q1 2013 and in Q2 dropped that down to 172,7222. It's still a significant position, but doesn't sound like a vote of confidence. He also dumped all of his SPDR Gold ETF. Soros also dumped 15,000 shares of Netflix, bringing his position in the stock down to 40,000 shares. And that's what's under the hood.
Heidi Gutman/CNBCJohn Paulson's new 13F quarterly regulatory filing is out. The highlight of the filing is that he's scaled back on his gold position. At the end of Q2, Paulson held just 10,234,852 shares of SPDR Gold Trust, down from 21,837,552 shares in Q1. Paulson, who made a name for himself by shorting subprime mortgages when the housing bubble burst, has been getting crushed by his bet on gold. The yellow metal is down by more than 20 % since the beginning of the year.
REUTERS/Simon NewmanJason Cropper, Managing Director of The Electronic Cigarette Company, smokes an electronic cigarette as he poses for the photographer in the Canary Wharf financial district of London, March 25, 2009. The potential for e-cigarettes to remake the tobacco industry remains huge. But that moment is still a long way off, according to Morgan Stanley analyst David Adelman. He explains that, yes, e-cig growth is already reducing regular cigarette consumption in the U.S., but only by a tiny bit. "Consumers are clearly interested in e-cigs, but they have a ~1% &amp; not a 10% share for a reason," he writes. "There is near universal awareness of e-cigs, with about 50% trial among smokers." "The fact that the category – today – is equivalent to only ~1% of US cigarette industry volume, in our view, demonstrates that the existing e-cigs do not fully satisfy smokers’ expectations." Here's more from Adelman: ...this is similar to the market share of Newport Red, and is significantly smaller than – on a unit equivalent basis – both the little cigar and pipe-your-own segments. To us, this indicates that the current products still do not fully meet the expectations of smokers from a performance, experience, branding, and familiarity perspective. We also believe that e-cigarettes’ share indicates some evidence of trial and rejection, as well as trial and selective and occasional use among continuing smokers (as opposed to wholesale product substitution). Adelman does not say what exactly smokers find e-cigs' shortcomings to be. But our Chris Anderson — who actually raved about them generally — notes that their battery life remains terrible. Something to work on.
Gluskin SheffI have been laying out the groundwork for the next phase of this cycle, which is good news for Main Street even if not that great for Wall Street or my long-held belief in the longevity of this secular disinflationary cycle ... which I think is now in its mature stage.  I think the people that write off the prospect of cost-push inflation are taking on a very myopic view. Inflation is a process, and it takes a long while to build. There is evidence that the consumer deleveraging cycle is largely over. Subprime auto credit is up 30% from a year ago. We are up to a 20% share of mortgages being originated with downpayments of less than 10%. CLO (collateralized loan obligation) issuance is back to 2007 levels. In the corporate space, fully one-third of high-yield debt issues this year have been centred in firms with the weakest balance sheets. At some point, money velocity and the money multiplier will stop falling. No doubt fiscal drag will take a chunk out of GDP growth in the near-term, but this too shall pass and the reality is that the aggregate supply curve (and this is true globally) has become increasingly inelastic. The pool of available skilled labour is shrinking rapidly and after five years of the weakest growth in the private sector capital stock, we are starting to see the lagged ill-effects on productivity growth. Potential non-inflationary growth had already been pared, in my estimates, to 1.7%. And the only way we could have experienced a drop in the unemployment rate in the past year from 8.2% to 7.4% in the face of sub-2% economic growth strongly suggests that we are now on our way to a potential non-inflationary speed limit of just 1%. Very European indeed.  I am not very bullish on the outlook for aggregate demand growth. But the shape of the aggregate supply curve is now so inelastic that it doesn’t take much in the way of growth in spending to generate higher inflation over time. I realize that is not evident just yet to the naked eye and this is a process that will be akin to watching grass grow. That is always the case. This is the big risk — margin compression affects the ‘E’, while inflation, insofar as the tight historical relationship with final prices holds, even if to a smaller degree this time around, affects the P/E. Once again, this becomes a strategy of adding some inflation hedges to the S.I.R.P. portfolio — exposure to tangibles or hard assets, and in some cases like resources and TIPS/RRBS (real return bonds), they have cheapened up very nicely of late. Within the equity universe, dividend coverage/payouts are augmented by screening of sectors and companies that have high-fixed costs and low variable costs, that have high capital/labour ratios and also high demand inelasticities (a.k.a. ‘pricing power’). Stay tuned as this theme becomes more fully fleshed out in the near future. Better to be prepared for shifts in the landscape than to be surprised. I keep emphasizing that it took Paul Volcker a good three years to kill inflation for good and it is taking longer for Bernanke to dispel deflation concerns even if the U.S. economy in terms of consumer prices has never deflated once in the past six decades, but he will ultimately be successful and my call for higher long-term rates is a secular view that does not dismiss out of hand the prospect that near-term cyclical pressures and the aggressive buying by the Fed does not lead to a test of the yield lows in coming months. It’s just a rally I would be glad to face as it probably is the last gasp in this three-decade old bond bull phase. Unless you do believe in deflation, it is going to be difficult to hold every maturity to the 10-year T-note negative in real terms (adjusted for the core CPI trend) and negative relative to nominal GDP across the entire curve indefinitely — that last part is only sustainable in a period of negative real growth rates which is hardly the case today and remains an elusive forecast for many a pundit. Have a look at Ben Bernanke’s analytical piece called Long-Term Interest Rates back on March 1st and assess the balance of risks — visibly one-sided even if the timing is up for debate.  The prospect that we are sitting at over 3% on the 10-year T-note yield a year from now and north of 4% by 2017 is hardly trivial. I’ve been in the deflation camp for two decades ... but strongly feel it is time to move on. It is a crowded trade. I used to say in the 1990s and 2000s that we had a generation of market pundits and players who only know higher interest rates and inflation. Today, we have a group of twenty, thirty and even forty-somethings who know little about bond selloffs, inflation or even what a normal Fed tightening cycle looks like. The new paradigm has shifted in the opposite direction and today’s ever-more consensus forecast of 1% yields on 10-year T-notes and 2% on the long bond based on deflation reminds me of the bold calls for 30% bond yields back in the early 1980s based on runaway inflation. Rosie’s Rule #4: “Fall in love with your partner, not your forecast”.  A recent McKinsey study found that only 43% of employers surveyed in nine countries believed they had a sufficient pool of skilled entry-level workers to choose from. Not only that, but mid-sized firms (between 50 and 500 employees) had an average of 13 entry-level positions sitting vacant. In other words, this is far more a skills mis-match story than one related to aging (though not aged) baby boomers. The reality is that employment has risen some three million since mid-2009 but for some reason, nine million adult Americans dropped out of the labour market altogether over this time frame. The demand is there with job openings rising 81% from the cycle lows and layoffs down 41%. The problem is that new hires are stagnating at best, and this is why the workweek is being lengthened and overtime hours being expanded. And the working class is beginning to notice that it is starting to have some bargaining power as the number of voluntary quits has risen 35% so far this cycle and are flirting near 41/2-year highs. While gross hirings are anemic, to be sure, companies are trying to hang onto their staff and as such, layoff rates have come down a long way. There may well be 90 million American adults outside of the labour market and another 12 million in the jobless ranks looking for a job but can’t find one because they don’t have the right skills, but rest assured that the 144 million who are gainfully employed are becoming ever more confident in their own prospects, and that is, again, underscored by a “voluntary quit’ rate that has also risen to a cycle high. No matter the reason, the reality is that capacity is being taken out of the jobs market (much like it has in the airline sector which is one area that now has pricing power as a result), and as such, less competition for available jobs will likely result in rising wage rates unless the laws of supply and demand have managed to bypass the labour market. Much of this “capacity reduction” may reflect the fact that an ever-rising number of the “99%” are actually getting paid not to work. So I would say this may be more about the incentive system than demographics.  For example, a record 23 million households are now on food stamps — up over 735,000 from a year ago and now this is representing close to 30% of the total number of adults who now reside outside the confines of the labour force. There are also nearly nine million Americans on disability and I do not want to at all disparage those who are truly physically hurt, but my only point is that the SSDI program (Social Security Disability Insurance) is bursting at the seams, having jumped by one million workers in just the past three years and 300,000 of these in just the past three months — an annual expense (to the taxpayer and it is non-wage income to the recipient) of $165 billion.  It will not be a straight line up, and in fact, I see the prospect of a still- oversold bond market seeing lower yield activity over the near-term, but don’t confuse the small and big picture here. The big picture is that the lows in Treasury yields were turned in a year ago when a three-decade secular bull market came to an end, and a secular bear market was in its infancy. You want more evidence? Go to the Bernanke piece he penned on March 1st titled “Long-Term Interest Rates” and you will see firsthand that the architect of today’s super-low interest rates himself sees 10-year T-note yields moving from today’s 2.5%-ish level to something closer to 4% or even higher in coming years.  So if you are an issuer, the time for refinancing is now, not later. And if you are an investor, don’t spend too long debating whether you should be starting to hedge your portfolio against the prospect of a rising long- term interest rate environment, even as central banks continue to keep short-term policy yields at the floor. From the perspective of an economist at a wealth management firm, this means embarking on strategies that over time will effectively hedge out interest rate risk, for example with exposure to hard assets, credit arbitrage, and screening in the equity market for companies with high fixed costs and low variable costs, high ratios of capital to labour, and firms with a proven history of being able to pass on cost increases to protect profit margins.    To download the PDF file of the report, please click here »

GlassdoorMcKinsey is the world's largest and most profitable management consulting firm, as well one of the most difficult places to get hired.  Over its 87-year existence it's had a massive impact on the U.S. economy according to "The Firm," a forthcoming book by Duff McDonald.  In a New York Observer column, pointed out by Mike Dang at The Billfold, McDonald argues that the massive modern-day gap between executive and worker pay has its origin with the consulting firm. It's a fascinating story that all started with General Motors commissioning a study on executive pay from McKinsey consultant Arch Patton. He found that from 1939 to 1950, hourly employee pay more than doubled, but top management pay went up only 35%. The study, published in the Harvard Business Review, became a series and turned national attention towardÂ executive compensation, promoting the idea that higher pay and bonuses were the lever to attract and retain top executives. Patton became a superstar, hired by managers who were not surprisingly interested in hearing they were underpaid. McKinsey's CEO apparently thought this type of consulting was beneath the firm, but wasn't about to turn down the money.Â  "For several years, Mr. Patton personally accounted for almost 10 percent of the firmâ€™s billings," McDonald writes. "At the end of the war, only 18 percent of companies in the country had bonus plans. By 1960, about 60 percent of them did." In 1961 came the books "Men, Money and Motivation: Executive Compensation as an Instrument of Leadership"Â and "What Is an Executive Worth?"Â  One McKinsey consultant told McDonald that Patton wrote "the same article [26] times for theÂ Harvard Business Review." Because of its popularity and McKinsey's influence, the idea became an entrenched philosophy, as did the concept that as a company grows, so should CEO pay. While Patton's compensation philosophy started with rigorous analysis of performance, soon it took on a life of its own, with executive pay spiraling higher and higher, while worker pay was left to languish. Here's where we are today, according to a report by The State Of Working America, a project of the Economic Policy Institute: State of Working America The AFL-CIO puts the number even higher, saying that the average Fortune 500 CEO makes 354 times the average wage of their employees. Some executives make 1,000 times more.Â  Of course, McKinsey and Patton weren't the only factor. Bull markets and economic expansion help push pay upwards and encourage investors to look the other way â€” and once it moves up, pay is slow to move back down. Meanwhile, slackÂ labor markets and weak growth prospects help toÂ explain stagnant wages. Regardless, McKinsey and Patton may have been a major driver in the gapÂ between CEO and employee wages explodingÂ by a factor of 10Â since the middle of the century.
ShutterstockA couple of "costs."As I've explained recently, one big problem with the U.S. economy these days is that big American companies are hoarding cash, treating their employees like "costs," and maximizing profits instead of investing in their people and future projects. This is contributing to record income inequality and starving the primary engine of U.S. economic growth — the vast American middle class — of purchasing power.  If average Americans don't get paid living wages, they can't can't buy products and services. And when average Americans can't buy products and services, the companies that sell them can't grow. So the profit obsession of America's big companies is, ironically, hurting their ability to grow. One reason American companies are treating their employees as "costs"--and seeking to minimize them--is that this is exactly what Wall Street insists that they do. As more of the economy's wealth has gone to investors, more of the country's smartest and most ambitious executives have followed the easy money to Wall Street. And these folks have done an extraordinary job of capturing a record share of the country's income and wealth for themselves. To make America's economy healthy again, we're going to have to persuade (or force) Wall Street and corporate America to share more of their wealth with the folks who create it--the hundred million or so Americans who work as average employees. But that's going to be tough to do. Why? Business Insider, St. Louis Fed, Bureau of Labor StatisticsThe percentage of America's income going to the people who generate it (a.k.a., "labor") has hit a record low.Because the "trickle-down" philosophy and power structure that has led to a record share of America's income going to the owners (a.k.a., "capital") has been decades in the making. And it's likely going to take decades to reverse. As evidence of this, I recently got the note below from a former state public official. He offered some examples of how entrenched our shareholder value religion has become: Your recent series on profits and pay has hit the nail on the head, and as a citizen I deeply appreciate you publishing and pressing on them. All of your points about capital winning over labor, the exaltation of short-term profits over long-term profitability and growth, and the view of labor as a cost that must always be minimized, challenge assumptions that Wall Street has baked into the "conventional wisdom" to its (and only its) advantage. From a macroeconomic standpoint, there are great arguments in favor of spreading more of a corporation's profits to employees. So please keep making them.For what it's worth, I offer two additional sets of observations. In my current role, I can't opine on these kinds of things publicly, so please don't identify me:1. This mindset of profit maximization uber alles is baked directly into American corporate law, in a way that makes it very hard for boards (especially of publicly traded companies) to measure success with anything other than returns to investors. Imagine the quarterly earnings call for a company that misses the Street's expectations -- or, God forbid, lowered its dividend -- because it decided to increase wages. Within nanoseconds, there would be calls for management's heads and complaints about inefficiency or a failure to stay competitive. And unless (and until) the company could demonstrate a tangible ROI from that decision -- higher sales/profits from happier, more productive employees, from a more robust local economy -- it would take an enormous risk pursuing such a strategy. Success would be hard to prove, especially for the company that might try this first or early, because competitors would have an incentive to keep their employee "costs" lower and take economic advantage of the difference. Under the current Street-oriented thinking, the only companies who will raise wages are those in a space where there's a shortage of skilled labor and a risk that they won't be able to compete if they lose people. And that leaves out a LOT of people and job functions.The problem of the governing law manifests itself most tangibly in the M&amp;A context. A public company that makes itself "uncompetitive" by increasing wages risks being taken over by a private equity firm that sees an opportunity to run the company more efficiently. And the law strongly favors the takeover because the only question a court would consider if the Board declined it would be the relative return to shareholders -- a long-term view of what's good for the company or the economy would lose to investors who want a premium return now. Always. So it's not enough to ask the question and re-frame our thinking -- the rules of the game are rigged to the advantage of the capital/investor class, and boards buck their thinking to their (and their companies') serious potential detriment. 2. This notion of investor expectations has other insidious tentacles. In my former public life, I saw investor expectations increasingly driving companies' strategies in two overt ways. First, despite the fact that regulated utilties are about the lowest-risk businesses in America, the companies routinely sought returns on equity of 10.5-11.75%, citing investors' expectations. Never mind the historically low interest rate environment and the dramatically lower cost of borrowing -- the companies brought in experts who opined that investors would leave these companies in droves without returns in that range. In one case, an expert argued that the low interest rate environment REQUIRED the state to increase the utilty's return because the returns in risk-free investments like insured bank deposits and Treasuries were so low -- in other words, someone had to provide an opportunity for investors to make a lot of money for little to no risk, and so it was incumbent on the state to raise electric and gas rates by a lot. Everyone just assumed that if we reached a decision that Wall Street deemed "unconstructive" or "negative," the utilities' credit would tighten and life would be bad, but they offered no actual evidence of this, and indeed when other factors (like the 2008 meltdown) tightened credit, they took the utilities down with everyone else. The argument was classic trickle-down -- take care of investors first and then good things might happen (but might not if other factors intecede). Any state that resisted these arguments was considered a hostile regulatory environment by the investor community, even with approved returns above 9.5% for nearly every one of these companies. Regulators in many states have sided with the industry, and investors have made a ton of money with virtually no risk. Second, more and more of the utility sector is controlled by large, publicly traded holding companies that view that business in Wall Street terms. So companies that began as local, monopoly service businesses accountable to their customers are now huge national and international companies for which which the regulated local company is expected to deliver cash and earnings to support the now-unregulated businesses in the bigger corporate family. This has happened because the financial community saw an opportunity in the 90s, got Congress to repeal the Public Utility Holding Company Act, then lobbied state legislatures to "restructure." Enron was a HUGE player in that movement, by the way. But much as you've observed with regard to employees being seen as "costs," the utility sector views customers entirely in terms of revenue and returns. In other words, Americans, get used to your lives as serfs. The day when America's companies once again share their wealth with all three of their constituencies--customers, shareholders, and employees--appears to be a long way off.

Neither Javier Martin-Artajo nor Julien Grout were the so-called "London Whale", yet they are the two former traders in the JP Morgan Chief Investment Office (CIO) that have been charged for various offenses related to the $6 billion loss that rocked the House of Dimon last year. The question is why? First thing's first, Bruno Iksil, the man known as the 'London Whale' has been talking to prosecutors about what happened in the CIO for months, and cut a deal to avoid prosecution. That leaves other traders in the CIO that managed the portfolio of synthetic dervitives in question to take the fall. Grout and Artajo are two such traders — both are charged with wire fraud, conspiracy to falsify books and records, and falsifying records to the SEC. According to the Department of Justice's complaint, the wire fraud charges stem from e-mails and phone calls starting around the end of March 2012, in which the two traders talked about their position in CIO's synthetic credit portfolio. It was at this point that it was clear that the portfolio was losing a ton of money, and they were definitely freaking out. Now, it's not illegal to lose money — which U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara pointed out in his press conference today — it's how these two traders allegedly tried to cover their losses that Bharara called "not a tempest in a teapot...but a perfect storm." For months in 2012, as the portfolio started losing millions of dollars ($130 million in January and $88 million in February) traders in the CIO thought they could hedge their way out of the hole they'd dug themselves into. To be able to do that, according to the Department of Justice's complaint, they hid their losses from their superiors and kept two separate accounts of the portfolio — one that had the fair value of the derivatives that they were trading, and another rosier account that did not. By March 15, 2012, said Bharara, the difference between those two books was $292 million. According to the complaint, a day later some of Martin-Artajo and Grout's co-workers (one co-conspirator named as "CC-1" and someone who entered a non-prosecution with the U.S. Attorney named as "CW-1") were asking Martin-Artajo to make the two books public. He wouldn't. DOJ complaint Two things to keep in mind here. First, by April, when the losses in the CIO became public, the hole had widened to $2 billion — so even without the $292 million difference, there had to be something wacky going on in the portfolio Martin-Artajo and Grout were presenting (thus the freak-out phone calls in late March). Another thing to keep in mind here is that the CIO is supposed to be reinvesting the bank's excess deposits — so at that point $350 million worth of un-loaned JP Morgan customer money.  That's doubly uncool to regulators. According to this narrative, the bank didn't know the extent of the damage that had been done because there were allegedly two separate accounts of this specific portfolio. As a result, when the bank released an 8-K earnings release it was inaccurate. That's where you get the "falsifying records to the SEC" charge. From the complaint against Grout (the language in both complaints is similar): DOJ Complaint And that's where you get why these two sort of random guys are having the book thrown at them.
Vimeo/miss tradeThe SEC has charged a hedge fund manager known for his Twitter presence with fraud. Ohio-based Anthony DavianÂ â€” known asÂ @hedgieguyÂ â€” "misappropriated more than $1 million from investors in funds managed by his company," according to the SEC filingÂ (via ZeroHedge). Davian raised at least $1.5 million from investors since 2011 and touted high returns, according to the filing. Such profits were "figments of Davian's imagination," the SEC argues. As one example, one investor wired Davian $100,400 into a bank account that previously had a balance of less than $13. Davian immediately transferred $65,000 of that money to another account and bought himself an Audi Q7, according to the filing. Last month, the Southern Investigative Reporting Foundation reported Davian was under investigation and had attempted suicide. Now it looks like investigators found what they were looking for. From the filing: Defendants promote Davian Capital as a highly successful investment firm managing a portfolio of profitable hedge funds. But Davian Capital is nothing more than Davian's personal piggy bank. He has invested only some of his clients' funds. He has used the rest to finance construction of a luxury home for himself, and to buy himself a luxury car, among other things. The SEC argues Davian falsely claimed his funds were generating high returns in "fabricated account statements." In late June investigators searched Davian's computer and records, according to the Southern Investigative Reporting Foundation'sÂ report. DavianÂ had become popular thanks to YouTube videos and a newsletter of trading tips.

US FundsIt's been tough to be a gold investor. The yellow metal is the worst performing commodity this year, falling 21% since January 1. But the gold bulls aren't giving up.Â  And like everyone else, they have charts and data to support what they believe to be a reasonable investment. Enter Frank Holmes, CEO and Chief Investment Officer of US Funds.Â  Holmes is one of the most widely respected voices in gold. Holmes recently presented at the Agora Financial Investment Symposium in Vancouver. His talk included a 71-page slide deck. We pulled the 50 key slides that support the gold bulls' undying investment case. 46 of those slides include charts making connections to money supply, emerging market demand, U.S. presidents, and many other things.
APThe political and finance worlds are abuzz with "September angst."Â And in Washington, the angst is looking like it will be pushed back â€” but it could be much more daunting than originally thought. That's because House Republicans and aides are signaling â€” according to The Washington Examiner's Conn CarrollÂ and National Review's Robert CostaÂ â€” that they will shift focus from using a potential government shutdown as leverage to negotiations over the debt ceiling.Â  Here's the gist, via Costa: Sources tell me the House GOP will probably avoid using a shutdown as leverage and instead use the debt limit and sequester fights as areas for potential legislative trades. Negotiations over increasing the debt limit have frequently been used to wring concessions out of the administration, so there may be movement in that direction: Delay Obamacare in exchange for an increased debt limit. Under this scenario, the GOP would pass a 60-day continuing resolution that keeps the government funded at existing levels under sequestration through the end of November â€” right around the time the debt ceiling will need to be raised. Then, House leadership would use Democrats' wishes to get rid of sequestration levels to extract concessions.Â  It's unclear, exactly, where the Affordable Care Act would fit into this. Republicans could plausibly tie in delays in certain parts of the law â€” which they still believe is the best strategy at eventually toppling the law altogether â€” to certain roll-backs in sequestration-level funding, or to some kind of hike in the debt ceiling.Â  As The Washington Post's Greg Sargent points out, this represents a very strategic risk for House Speaker John Boehner.Â  After the fiscal cliff deal in January, Boehner said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal that he did not view the debt ceiling as the "ultimate leverage" in budget talks with Obama. He said that the sequester cuts would be better leverage, and his gamble paid off big time. Republicans raised the debt ceiling last time, the sequester kicked in, and, so far, the doom and gloom predicted by the Obama administration hasn't been felt in large part. Going back to making the debt ceiling a focal point represents a risk. The 2011 fight pummeled the Republican image, and it led to a downgrade in the nation's credit rating. Sargent also points out that the negotiations on Obamacare would have to comeÂ after enrollment in insurance exchanges begins on Oct. 1. In essence, Republicans would be demanding a delay in Obamacare implementation as it is being implemented, in exchange for not letting the country default on its obligations.
flickr/Brook WardWhy has QE not led to the massive hyper-inflationary spike that Allan Meltzer, the Austrian economics cohort and so many other monetary hawks have been screaming about since 2009? Because that's not how it works. A change in the way the Fed and banks handle reserves in 2008 was missed by many and has caused a tremendous opportunity loss for those who've sat out the stock market recovery or have been blown up in commodity investments. S&amp;P's Chief Global Economist Paul Sheard tackles the topic in a new research report, combatively titled: Repeat After Me: Banks Cannot And Do Not "Lend Out" Reserves Highlights below: Many talk as if banks can "lend out" their reserves, raising concerns that massive excess reserves created by QE could fuel runaway credit creation and inflation in the future. But banks cannot lend their reserves directly to commercial borrowers, so this concern is misplaced. Banks do need to hold reserves (as a liquidity buffer) against their deposits, and banks create deposits when they lend. But normally banks are not reserve constrained, so excess reserves do not loosen a reserve constraint. Banks in aggregate can reduce their reserves only to the extent that they initiate new lending and the bank deposits created as a result flow into the economy as new banknotes as the public demands more of them. QE does aim to ease financial conditions and spur more bank lending than otherwise would have occurred, but the mechanisms by which this happens are much more subtle and indirect than commonly implied. If the excess reserves created by QE were to be associated with too much credit creation, central banks could readily extinguish them. If this sort of thing is your bag, read on: Repeat After Me: Banks Cannot And Do Not "Lend Out" Reserves - PDF (S&amp;P)
Meat purveyor and world-famous butcher Pat LaFrieda was on Bloomberg TV today talking about the price of beef. It's a hot topic as next year's production is set to fall to a 21-year low. This is, without question, terrible news. Don't freak out yet, though, as LaFrieda says that farmers are already working on expanding their inventory by retaining heifers for breeding. That should help you sleep better tonight, but after that good news LaFrieda explained something almost equally unsettling. Bloomberg TV's Erik Schatzker asked LaFrieda why he was so negative about "grass fed" beef even though it's the only part of the industry that continuously experiences double digit growth. LaFrieda responded by saying that his restaurant customers sometimes start off asking for a "grass fed program" which he's happy to supply but... "What most people don't know... is that all beef is grass fed for about 85% of its life. It's finished off on grain. The carbon foot print of something that's grass fed is much larger because what's not being taken under consideration is that it has to live a lot longer to get to weight if it's not fed grain or corn."

Consumers aren't buying discretionary items like clothes right now.  So says Macy's CEO Terry Lundgren as the company reported earnings that disappointed Wall Street for the first time in four years today.  “Our performance in the period, in part, reflects consumers’ continuing uncertainty about spending on discretionary items in the current economic environment,” Lundgren said in a release.  The situation at Macy's shows the continued challenges faced by average Americans, Brian Yarbrough, an analyst with Edward Jones, told Bloomberg.  “It’s still pretty tough out there for middle-income consumers,” Yarbrough said. “If you look at the kinds of jobs people are getting, they are service jobs paying $9 to $12 an hour. They are spending on homes and cars, they are not spending on apparel.” The slowdown doesn't bode well for other retailers, especially embattled competitor JCPenney, reports Andria Cheng at MarketWatch.  "With consumers’ disposable income seeing little growth, apparel and retailers selling nonessential things have also had to compete with increased spending for bigger-ticket items such as autos," Cheng writes. 
Wikimedia CommonsSarrazac, FranceSARRAZAC, France (Reuters) - Hundreds of miles from the bustling trading rooms where he worked with the "London Whale", a former JPMorgan trader has taken refuge in a French hamlet where few have heard of the $6.2 billion scandal to which he is being linked. U.S. authorities on Wednesday filed charges against Julien Grout for crimes related to the scandal, including wire fraud, conspiracy and the falsifying of books and records. But in sun-drenched Sarrazac, a village of two dozen stone houses built around a medieval church in southern France, the affair had barely registered before this week. In his parents' picturesque holiday home, with slate roof, mown grass and an old Citroen car outside, former JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co junior trader Grout is keeping a low profile and settling in with his wife and two daughters. French national Grout was indicted along with Javier Martin-Artajo, who worked in London as the direct supervisor of Bruno Iksil, the trader who became known as "the London Whale" in the JPMorgan scandal in which bad derivatives bets ended up costing the largest U.S. bank more than $6.2 billion. A U.S. senate report said that Grout, who reported to Iksil and was in charge of recording the prices of positions on the trading book, warned his superior in a recorded phone conversation in March 2012 that the team's reporting strategy would be "a big fiasco" and end up in "big drama". Grout is the lowest-ranked person targeted so far in the investigation, but several sources familiar with the prosecutors' thinking say that they are trying to build an unbroken chain from the bottom up to Martin-Artajo. "He has just arrived, he seems to be a very nice guy," said Sarrazac mayor Habib Fenni, who met Grout a day earlier and was not aware of JPMorgan's troubles or the role the French village's new resident is alleged to have played in them. Village restaurant owner Chantal Guerby, meanwhile, described Grout as "a nice guy who keeps himself to himself". Neighbors said that Grout's parents have been coming to their holiday home for many years, with Grout also visiting from London once in a while. 'NOT FLEEING' The criminal investigation is focusing on whether anyone responsible for the trades deliberately tried to hide the losses by inflating the value at which they were recorded on JPMorgan's books at the height of the scandal. Grout's lawyer, Edward Little, says his client has done nothing wrong. "We're confident he will eventually be cleared of all wrongdoing," he told Reuters in New York before the indictment. "He's in France only because he moved there several months ago, not because he was fleeing anything." Grout, who is in his mid-thirties, declined to answer questions from a Reuters reporter in Sarrazac on Tuesday, but a source with knowledge of the matter has said that he will offer to face the charges in the United States on the condition that he is granted bail. Outside the family holiday home, Grout's father would only say "no comment" when asked if his son was available to speak. In a brief telephone conversation, after his mother said she would ask if he wanted to talk or not, an unidentified man said: "No comment. Goodbye. Have a nice day." Reuters reported last week that Iksil, who earned his nickname after making outsized bets in a thinly traded derivatives market, is cooperating with the U.S. authorities and will not face any charges. It is not clear when Martin-Artajo will appear in court in the United States. The Spaniard still lives in London but is travelling abroad on a summer holiday. The Federal Bureau of Investigation in New York and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), along with regulators in Britain, all opened investigations last year into the costly derivatives bets. The case is still open, but JPMorgan is close to agreeing a deal with the SEC, which would require the bank to pay a penalty and admit faults, a source familiar with the matter said. This all seems a million miles from tiny Sarrazac, located in a lush, rural region about a two-hour drive from Bordeaux, with the silence broken only by the half-hourly church bells. There is a hospital away from the heart of the village and local businesses include a bakery and a real estate agent. But no bank.

APWall Street's chart gurus have spotted the ominous "Hindenburg Omen" in the stock market today. Today's sighting is the sixth one in just eight days, and that's pretty significant for folks who believe history repeats itself. Last week, SentimenTrader's Jason Goepfert discussed the clustering of Hindenburg Omens. Here's an excerpt via UBS's Art Cashin (It's still relevant today): With the latest market rally, the Omens are flaring up again.Â  There have been 5 Omens triggered out of the past 8 trading sessions (your data may vary - we're using the same sources we've always used for historical data).Â  That's actually the closest-grouped cluster since early November 2007. It's extremely rare to see as many Omens occurring together as we've seen over the past 50 days.Â  The last time was prior to the bear market in 2007.Â  The time before that was prior to the bear market in 2000. So, what exactly is the Hindenburg Omen? As Goepfert suggests, not everyone has the same definition.Â  But here's Wikipedia's criteria: Doomers will argue that this only supports their case for a major 1987-style sell-off. But Art Cashin warns that this obviously isn't a sure thing. "The viewers should be alert to it, but they shouldn't be panicked," said Cashin in an interview with CNBC on Tuesday. "It is a signal that says they may have a serious sell-off not they must have a serious sell-off." The Dow is down by around 65 points in early afternoon trading.
Google FinanceThe stock market has been in the red all day, and it's currently trading near the lows of the day. The Dow is down 112 points The S&amp;P 500 has fallen to 1,686, down 8 points for the day. The S&amp;P's all-time high of 1,709 is slowly getting farther and farther away. Earlier today, we learned that producer prices were unchanged in July, largely due to falling gas and electricity prices.Â  Economists were looking for an increase of 0.3%. This is a sign that deflation may be a bigger risk than inflation. However, it may be too soon to get too worried. "We doubt that Julyâ€™s soft producer prices figures will force the Fed to conclude that the recent downward trend in core price pressures is more than temporary," said Capital Economics Paul Dales.
Mike Nudelman / BI In Denver, Colorado, something is happening that has not occurred on U.S. soil for decades.  A hot commodity that many people love is completing the transition from a black market to a medicalized market to a fully legal market, something unseen in the United States since the repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment.  Mike Nudelman / BI Forty-two percent of Americans have used it. Prominent doctors are enthusiastically endorsing it. The substance is not chemically addictive and has demonstrated medical uses.  Plus, smoking it is considered quite fun by enthusiasts.  We're talking of course about Cannabis. Media coverage of the marijuana business and legalization effort has relied on lame puns, tired jokes, or totally modern references to a 1936 film about marijuana.  Stories are typically accompanied by a picture of a person smoking the largest joint you've ever seen.  But let's get down to brass tacks.  Walter Hickey / BI In Colorado, the market for direct sales of cannabis is estimated to be approximately $600 million in the first year of legalization. That doesn't factor in the booming sector of business services — security, software, capital investment, advertising — working on the sidelines and catering to the people directly involved in selling marijuana.  In essence, the levity that tinges the coverage of marijuana makes people forget that this is a huge market. Colorado anticipates a $130.1 million increases to state revenue because of marijuana legalization, which is nothing to smirk at.  WalterMe.I flew out to Colorado a few weeks ago to see what it's like to build an industry from the ground up. I talked to the the entrepreneurs who are defining what a well-regulated legal marijuana market can achieve. I talked to the activists and lobbyists who were there every step of the way to legalization. I spoke with startups and established brands, with businesses that have attracted the attention of Wall Street as well as those that handle marijuana on a daily basis.  To see an emerging market up close and in action, you no longer have to fly to a BRIC country. All you really need is a ticket to Denver.  Over the next several days, we'll take you on tours of the facilities growing and selling marijuana. We'll show you how state-of-the-art scientific techniques are being used to analyze the marijuana on the market on a scientific level.  Walter Hickey / BIWater pipe production at Heady Glass We'll have interviews with entrepreneurs who are making marijuana possible, like Canna Security, the security company that make the industry safe, or Weedmaps, the internet startup that plans to be the ESPN of pot.  We'll also look back and see how marijuana became legal in Colorado — a shining example of involved democracy that should make you proud to be an American — and were the people working on it see marijuana coming next.  I spoke to attorneys who left cushy corporate jobs to become the legal resource that an industry in this growth phase desperately needs, and agriculture specialists who view growing the best marijuana on the market as their next big goal.  We'll also look into some of the biggest challenges facing entrepreneurs in the Colorado marijuana industry – production issues, banking restrictions, how exactly people who sell marijuana for a living pay taxes.   Walter Hickey / BIWe'll also talk about the marijuana that the entrepreneurs smoke, how they name it, and how to get a job in the business. We'll also talk about the heartbreaking stories of marijuana patients, and the generous philanthropy the kings of Denver marijuana organize. What's happening in Denver is something very special, something that we're not going to see again in a long time. Entrepreneurs built an industry from nothing, dragging it from illegitimacy to the point that it's easier to buy cannabis than Sudafed. What comes next after legalization is something this country hasn't seen in generations. Colorado, for the first time in 150 years, is about to have a gold rush. Let's see how they're preparing for it.
The folks up at GMO (legendary investor Jeremy Grantham's shop) have published their latest asset-class forecasts. The news is not good for those who own U.S. stocks. The stock market has run so far so fast that GMO's valuation analysis, which assumes that today's super-high corporate profit margins will eventually regress to their means, predicts that inflation adjusted returns for U.S. stocks will be negative over the next 7 years. (Except for "high-quality" stocks--low debt, high cash flow). International stocks will do better but still badly, GMO predicts. The only opportunity for an average equity return--about 6.5% per year--will come in emerging markets, which have been demolished lately. (The lower the price goes, the better the future return is projected to be).Â  Bonds aren't much better, though. Neither is cash. The only asset class that GMO expects to deliver compelling returns other than emerging-market stocks is... timber. So if you're dying to invest in something, maybe go out and buy some trees.Â  GMO
Evan Agostini/APDoug Kass, head of Seabreeze Partners, has been bearish on stocks for most of the year. "I'm getting the 'summer of 1987 feeling' in the U.S. equity market," Kass told CNBC in February, "which means we're headed for a sharp fall." Â  Yesterday, he released his top 10 reasons why he believes the market has peaked. He introduces his list by comparing himself to Johnny Depp: There is certainly no arrogance in my bearish/top view expressed today, as some of my previous market forecasts have been wrong-footed in a bull market that has been a buy on every dip. Similar toÂ Johnny Depp, who has experienced several high-profile and recent movie flops, I have been chastened (and I am poorer) based on my mistaken market views throughout this year. But he forges on. Here's the ultra-paraphrased version of his list: 1) Â Low interest rates barely helped, and higher ones will hurt. 2) Â That said, tapering too soon will also do damage. 3) Â Kass has no idea where the U.S. economy is going given recent uneven data. 4) Â Ditto for China. 5) Â A Larry Summers-led Fed will mean reduced transparency and increased volatility. 6) Â A debt ceiling fight and/or government shutdown will poison Â markets. 7) Â 'The bull market is long in the tooth' ... 8) Â ... And recent highs have not been confirmed. 9) Â Market sector leaders like financials and housing are losing momentum. 10) P/E ratios are in imminent danger of collapse. We respect his consistency.

CNBCMuch of the debate over taxing the wealthy focuses on taxing giant salaries. But a new study from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center found that the real money for the wealthy is made from investments and business incomeâ€”not compensation. The paper, from Joseph Rosenberg, takes a broader definition of income. The so-called "Expanded Cash Income" includes retirement and health-care benefits, retirement income, tax-exempt interest and other add-ons aimed at providing a more accurate picture of the nation's income distribution. The results show a stark contrast between the 1 percent and the rest. The population as a whole earns 64 percent of its expanded cash income from so-called "compensation," basically a paycheck from a company. But the top 1 percent earns only 39 percent from compensation. It gets 24 percent from business income and 29 percent from investments. The top 0.1 percent is even more reliant on investments, with 35 percent of their income from investments. In other words, the richer you are, the more likely you'll make your money from investing or owning a business. As Jared Bernstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities points out, "Once you get up to the very top of the income scale ... you've got two-thirds of their income coming from nonlabor sources." (Read more:Â Meet the new wealthy: The cash hoarders) That's not to imply that the wealthy are just living off passive income, or that they're not working as hard as the everyday American. Business owners, in fact, often work longer hours than full-time employees. "When we think about small business owners, these are 24-7 people and they can be working harder than you or me," said Roberton Williams of the Tax Policy Center. He said there is little correlation between the type of income people receive and their level of work. (Read more:Â Yes, the rich are different: They don't retire) Indeed, economist Emmanuel Saez of the University of California at Berkeley writes that since the 1970s, the rising incomes of the wealthy are due largely to a growth in their wages and salary income. "The evidence suggests that top income earners today are not 'rentiers' deriving their incomes from past wealth but rather the 'working rich."' Of course, working might also mean "owning." â€”By CNBC's Robert Frank. Follow him on TwitterÂ @robtfrank
Everyone wants to be a millionaire – but what does a billionaire want to be? They’re already so rich that their investing decisions might have more to do with making a big splash or scratching an itch than making a buck.  Jeff Bezos recently paid $250 million (1 percent of his fortune) for the Washington Post, which lost $50 million so far this year. Is it boredom? A childhood fantasy? The pursuit of glory? Here are 10 investments of the super-rich that make Bezos’s bold purchase of the Post look as safe as buying T-bills.
As we noted last night, the current cluster of Hindenburg Omens is the most concentrated on record and today just made it worse.

There's been yet another major snag in the Federal Reserve's mission to introduce the hundred-dollar bill. This time, a printing error called "mashing" â€“ when too much ink is applied to the paper â€“ has rendered 30 million bills totally useless, a spokesperson for the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP)Â confirmed to the New Yorker's David Wolman. "This time, recent batches of cash from the Washington, D.C., plant contained 'clearly unacceptable' bills intermixed with passable ones, according to a July memo to employees from Larry Felix, the bureauâ€™s director," Wolman explains. "So the Fed is returning more than thirty million hundred-dollar notes and demanding its money back, Felix wrote. Another thirty billion dollarsâ€™ worth of paper sits in limbo awaiting examination, and Fed officials have informed the bureau that they will not accept any hundred-dollar notes made at the Washington, D.C., facility until further notice." This is only the latest in a string of screw-ups that have kept the $100 bill out of circulation well past its original 2011 due date. Another printing error caused bills to be printed with a blank spot. And just a year ago, thieves made off with a massive shipment of the new bills.Â  Now, the Bureau is on damage control, sprinting to meet an October 8 deadline to get the notes printed â€“ correctly â€“ and finally into circulation.Â  A BEP spokesperson told BI they are "investigating this issue to determine the root cause" and will start by re-inspecting the notes to sift out any tainted ones."Â  "The $100 notes returned to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing had a small proportion of notes affected by mashing, which were included with many, good, quality notes.Â  Itâ€™s expected only a marginal fraction of the notes will be unacceptable," the spokesperson said. In the meantime, taxpayers will likely be left to pick up the tab for disposing of the bills and whatever extra time is needed to print them again.Â  Just in case you're sick of waiting for the new bills to arrive, here's a mock-up of what the new bill will look like. via Federal Reserve It's going to be tricked out with colors that change when you bend it, an image of the liberty bell, and a new blue, 3-D anti-counterfeit strip hidden inside.Â 
How are you supposed to regain your Brazilian commodities and logistics empire if you don't have a decent mode of transport from Rio to Sao Paolo? That's the question we're asking since Bloomberg reported that former billionaire tycoon Eike Batista has sold his Brazilian-made Embraer Legacy 600 plane. At this time last year, Batista was one of the 10 richest people in the world, then everything turned. His umbrella company EBX, holds 6 companies that control everything from coal mines to off shore drilling logistics all over Brazil. It used to be worth an estimate $33.5 billion. Now its worth is unknown, but Bloomberg estimates that Batista himself is worth about $200 million. And then there's all the serious people he owes billions of dollars to. So it makes sense that Batista had to sell his wings â€” but it's still sad. Embraer, for its part, is hoping that an improving U.S. economy will help boost its sales. The company hasn't had a bad year either. From Bloomberg: Commercial regional-jet orders, not business aircraft, have buoyed Embraer in 2013, sending the stock up 33 percent through yesterday as Brazilâ€™s benchmark Ibovespa index fell 17 percent. Bombardier rose 30 percent. Orders from U.S. airlines helped push Embraerâ€™s firm order backlog to 366 regional jets, topping the 279 for Montreal-based Bombardierâ€™s competing models. Embraer fell 0.8 percent to 19.05 reais at 11:20 a.m. in Sao Paulo.

People talking about Apple are getting a little bit loopy. In response to the news that Carl Icahn bought $1 billion shares of Apple, Jim Cramer said on CNBC, Icahn should get a seat on the company's board.Â  "Maybe he wants a seat at the table. Would I give him a seat? Yeah," Cramer said this morning, adding, "I think Icahn is the single best investor in America today, so yes I would." Cramer's argument in Icahn's favor is that Apple CEO Tim Cook is too conservative. While Apple announced a program to return $100 billion to shareholders, Cramer thinks it's not enough.Â  He says Cook is focused on customers, but not capital. He thinks Icahn would be good for focusing on capital and shareholders.Â  REMINDER: Icahn's $1 billion buy isn't even 1% of Apple's stock. There are dozens of shareholders with that much, or more Apple stock. The only reason stuff like this is even coming up is because Apple's shares tanked from $700 to $400 in six months.Â  The reason those shares tanked was because Apple's earnings began to shrink. And the reason Apple's earnings began to shrink was that Apple's astounding iPhone and iPad businesses began to slow. Apple needs new products to get its earnings growing again. Carl Icahn isn't going to help with that. He's just a sideshow and a distraction. Any second Tim Cook spends with Icahn instead of on new products is a waste of time. 
FRBNYThe New York Fed's Quarterly Report On Household Debt And Credit is out. And while overall household debt fell by $78 billion in Q2, total auto loan balances increased by $20 billion during the period. "Bureau of Economic Analysis data indicate that light motor vehicle sales, which fell sharply during the Great Recession to levels that hadnâ€™t been seen since the early 1980s, made a V- shape recovery," note the NY Fed. "Delinquency rates improved considerably, with the overall ninety-plus day delinquency rate falling to 5.7 percent, the lowest it has been since mid-2008," they added. The report includes some interesting charts about auto loans, including one that breaks them down by credit score and another by age. "About 23 percent of new auto loans (calculated as a share of aggregate loan balances originated) were issued to borrowers with credit scores under 620 in 2013:Q2, well below the 25-30 percent shares that we have seen historically," they said. "On the other end, the share of borrowers with credit scores over 720 peaked at over 50 percent during the recession and is about 45 percent now." FRBNY "Does the slower recovery in the other age groups reflect that people are taking out smaller loans, or that fewer people are borrowing?" they asked. "While borrowers of all ages took out smaller loans during the recession, average loan amounts have recovered their pre-recession levels for most groups. (The slight exception is thirty- to thirty-nine-year-olds, who took out the largest loans during the boom and remain about $650 below their peak loan amounts.) So, declines in aggregate origination volumes are attributable to lower take-up, not smaller loan sizes." FRBNY
The New York Fed just published its latest Quarterly Report On Household Debt And Credit. "In Q2 2013 total household indebtedness fell to $11.15 trillion; 0.7% lower than the previous quarter and 12 percent below the peak of $12.68 trillion in Q3 2008," said the NY Fed in a press release. "Mortgages, the largest component of household debt, fell $91 billion from the first quarter." "Total auto loan balances increased $20 billion from the previous quarter, the ninth consecutive quarterly increase and the largest quarter over quarter increase since 2006," they added. Here are some of the highlights via the NY Fed: Here's the NY Fed's chart: FRBNY
ReutersLast night embattled hedge fund manager Bill Ackman was on "Charlie Rose" explaining everything from Herbalife to JCPenney to Dan Loeb. If you missed it, the interview will air again tonight at 8:00 pm on Bloomberg TV. "JCPanic" and the Herbalife hedge fund titan war aside, we learned a lot about Ackman the man in this interview â€” like how he wouldn't want to do any other job than the one he has now. He said he'd even do it for free, because restructuring companies does such a service for the American economy. Ackman's got some ideas on that too â€” the American economy, that is â€” and those ideas led to a discussion about politics that made Ackman sound like he was stumping in Washington. He even touched on Mitt Romney (a topic no Wall Streeter has broached in a loooonnnng while). From the transcript (via Bloomberg TV): BILL ACKMAN: ...I think what people forget is, you know, Wall Street has unfortunately in the last -- certainly since the crisis, has gotten a pretty bad name, but Wall Street is responsible -- itâ€™s probably the biggest engine for job creation, enabling businesses to access capital, enabling businesses to grow. You look at Howard Hughes was a creation out of thin air. Itâ€™s now a business that employs -- you know, itâ€™s going to employ thousands of people, create a ton of jobs. CHARLIE ROSE: Do you think the criticism of Mitt Romney during the campaign for his activities in running a private equity firm were unfair? BILL ACKMAN: Yes, yes -- absolutely. I think good, private equity investors create a lot more economic value than they destroy. That's when Bill, who has given money to both Republicans and Democrats over the years, and Charlie got down to solutions. CHARLIE ROSE: What will save the country? BILL ACKMAN: What will save the country are good economic policies that create the right incentives and an administration that is supportive of the business community. I think thatâ€™s actually very important. And, you know, policies that will make us competitive globally. Itâ€™s a global economy. The story today I think in todayâ€™s "Journal" about companies merging with European businesses to move their operations offshore from a tax point of view. We have to have a tax policy that discourages that kind of activity. CHARLIE ROSE: So you can bring the money home. BILL ACKMAN: Yes. I look at the United States -- CHARLIE ROSE: Is that the idea, have a tax policy so that the money will come home rather moving it offshore so you donâ€™t have to pay taxes on it. BILL ACKMAN: Yes. But I think if -- you know, the United States is not dissimilar to the kind of companies we invest in. We invest generally in very good companies that have lost their way. And with better management, enormous value can be created. If you look at Canadian Pacific, this was a dying -- CHARLIE ROSE: This is one of your investments. BILL ACKMAN: -- it was dying railroad under Hunter Harrison. And in very short order, you know, less than a year and a half heâ€™s made dramatic changes to the business. The President is the CEO of this business that we call America. And the decisions he makes with respect to, you know, the way incentives are designed, the way he works with Congress as a leader in effectuating policy change can make an enormous difference in the growth rate of the country, in job creation, in happiness, in our safety I think that we canâ€™t diminish the importance of business and business practices. I mean look at what Bloomberg has accomplished as the mayor of New York City. He took his for-profit mentality and has applied it to a city. And I think the city has accordingly thrived. Iâ€™d love to see the same thing happen to the country. And here's the kicker we know some of Wall Street was golf clapping for: CHARLIE ROSE: So we should only let rich people? BILL ACKMAN: No, but we should -- I think that thereâ€™s a lot to be said to have someone with a business background making decisions about the economy. Ackman closed the interview by saying that if he weren't an investor, he might go into politics â€” but only if he could "effectuate change" the way he does at his hedge fund. So Ackman for President? Leave you thoughts in the comments.
The weakest components of capital spending in the current expansion are structures (down 8.5% vs. up 6.2%, on average, for the previous six expansions), information processing equipment (25.1% vs. the 71.9% previous average), and software (18.2% vs. the 66.4% previous average). The last two categories have experienced the weakest spending this recovery of all the measured periods. My hunch is that the Cloud has radically increased the productivity (bang per buck) of technology. In other words, less is more: Less IT hardware and software can do much more than in the past.  On the other hand, capital spending on transportation equipment is the best ever, up 224.4% this recovery vs. an average of 47.2% in the past. Spending on industrial equipment is about average, with a gain of 23.3% compared to the previous average of 25.7%. By the way, spending on overall real intellectual property products is the weakest of the seven expansions since 1961; real R&amp;D (one of its components) is the third worst of the seven.  Admittedly, there isn’t much here to make the case for a capital spending boom in the US, especially if my more-bang-per-buck thesis is valid for technology. However, there could be booming demand overseas for capital goods made in the USA. The latest US trade figures show capital good exports (excluding autos) rising rapidly to a new record high of $554.6 billion (saar) during June. They account for 62% of nondefense capital goods shipments (including civilian aircraft).  Today's Morning Briefing: You Asked for It. (1) William Tell’s son. (2) Hazardous, but not dangerous work. (3) Investigating three open investment strategy cases. (4) June’s leading indicators bullish for Europe. (5) So are US exports to Europe. (6) US capital spending weakness led by structures and IT.

REUTERS/Carlos BarriaWomen in Hong Kong are using their designer bags as loan collateral, the Wall Street Journal reports. Residents prefer pawning their Pradas to nonbank lenders who have more versatility in terms of loan size and type of collateral than regulated banks. One company, "Yes Lady," can get you a loan in 30 minutes at 80% of the bag's value, "as long as it is fromÂ Gucci, Chanel, HermÃ¨s or Louis Vuitton," according to the Journal. Here's how it's done: A customer gets her bag back by repaying the loan at 4% monthly interest within four months. Yes Lady says almost all its clients quickly pay off their loans and reclaim their bags. The company recently lent about US$20,600 in exchange for a HermÃ¨s Birkin bag, but Yes Lady's purse-backed loans start at about US$200. One client brought in 40 to 50 Gucci purses at one time and received a $38,000 loan, according to the report. Yes Lady brings in assessors to check purses' authenticity, and if it's a fake, "We don't tell them we know," the company's manager told the Journal. "We just say we can't approve the loan."

Asa Mathat | D: All Things DigitalForget about Carl, Tim. Focus on the iPhone.I'm an Apple shareholder, so from a personal finance point of view, I'm not unhappy with what happened yesterday. As a market observer and fan of Apple's products, however, I'm annoyed. What happened yesterday, in case you missed it, is that a famous investor named Carl Icahn announced in a Tweet that he had bought a bunch of Apple stock and had just talked to Apple CEO Tim Cook on the phone. Carl Icahn's private conversation with Tim Cook had gone well, Carl Icahn said, and Icahn said he planned to talk to Tim Cook again soon. Apple quickly confirmed on the record that Carl Icahn and Tim Cook had had a conversation (with the aim, I assume, of demonstrating that Apple is responsive to its shareholders). And in the next couple of hours, Apple's stock exploded 5% higher, increasing the company's market value by $17 billion. Now, again, as a shareholder, I'm not going to object too loudly to the fact that Apple's stock jumped 5% in two hours. But I have two issues with this... The first isn't so much an "issue" as an observation: In case anyone out there has ever been tempted to believe that the stock trading game is "a level playing field," this incident should be a cold bucket of water in the face. You and I cannot buy some Apple stock and then call Apple and demand to talk to Tim Cook. We also can't buy the stock knowing that we will likely be able to put ourselves firmly in the black merely by tweeting that we have bought the stock and saying that we have just had an encouraging private conversation with the company's CEO.  This incident should make crystal clear, in other words, that Carl Icahn and other big investors have a very significant "edge" over the rest of us. And in case we get tempted to play the trading game, we should remember who the suckers at the table are: Us. The second issue I have with what happened yesterday is the reminder that Apple CEO Tim Cook is wasting his time having private conversations with investors. I realize that this is standard practice for public-company CEOs these days, but I wish it weren't. Companies like Apple already share an extraordinary amount of information with their investors. (Glance through even one quarterly filing and listen to one quarterly conference call and you'll be astounded at how much information you get.) They also publish press releases, announce products, and employ vast investor and media relations departments to spend gobs of time holding the hands of investors and reporters. CEOs and senior managers like Tim Cook also speak relatively frequently in public. So investors who don't feel like they're getting enough information from the conference calls, press releases, product announcements, investor relations folks, and SEC filings can try to pick up some nuggets from from those public utterances. Meanwhile, companies like Apple also have hundreds of major shareholders. Carl Icahn owns a billion dollars worth of Apple stock? So what. That's still chump change. Dozens of Apple shareholders own more than a billion dollars of Apple stock. State Street owns $15 billion, for example. So does Fidelity. BlackRock owns $11 billion. Northern Trust, Bank of New York, Susquehanna, J.P. Morgan, Invesco, and T. Rowe Price each own $5-$6 billion. And so on. If Tim Cook is going to race to the phone when Carl Icahn calls, is he also going to make time to talk to each of these other much-more-significant investors, too? After all, these other big shareholders probably have lots of questions and suggestions for Tim Cook, too. And what shareholder wouldn't want to have a private conversation with Apple's CEO every once in a while? Then there's the disclosure issue. Even if Tim Cook is extremely careful not to say anything in these private conversations that he and Apple haven't said in public, there's always the "body language" thing. As any junior Wall Street analyst quickly learns, the way a CEO says something is often as (or more) informative than what the CEO actually says. And if this body language communicates anything helpful, well, then, that's information that other investors would probably like to have. And then there's the time commitment. As the CEO of one of the world's biggest companies, Tim Cook has a lot that he could spend his time on. Personally, as a small Apple shareholder and customer, I would rather have Tim Cook spend his time working on Apple's products and management team than wasting his time having private conversations with bigger Apple shareholders. I'd rather have him pressing Jony Ive to design a bigger iPhone, for example. I'd rather have him out trying to recruit a great leader for Apple's retail stores. I'd rather have him negotiating with China Mobile to try to cut a deal to have China Mobile sell the iPhone. I'd rather have him doing just about anything other than having private conversations with investors--especially ones that I'm not privvy to. If Tim Cook wants to get suggestions from Apple investors, that's different, and that's fine. But if Tim Cook wants to get investor suggestions, I'd rather he just say that and then provide an email address to which all investors can send them. But won't big investors like Carl Icahn be furious about being snubbed? Don't these big investors have a right to have private conversations with Tim Cook? If Tim Cook refuses to waste his time talking to these investors, won't they, gulp, threaten to sell their stock? Yes, investors like Carl Icahn might be mad if Tim Cook refuses to talk to them. But so what. Let them be mad. These investors don't have a "right" to talk privately with the CEO of one of the world's biggest companies, especially when they own only one quarter of one percent of the company's stock. If these investors threaten to sell their stock because the CEO won't talk to them, then let them sell their stock. Carl Icahn didn't own Apple stock a few months ago, and he probably won't own it a few months from now. Apple doesn't need to keep Carl Icahn happy. And having Apple's CEO take the time to have private conversations with Carl Icahn is not just unfair all other Apple shareholders. It's also a colossal waste of time. If securities regulators are actually serious about trying to create a "level playing field," one of the things they should do is eliminate private meetings and conversations between senior managers and investors altogether. Without having the ability to have these meetings, or know what information is communicated in them, non-huge investors are at a major disadvantage. But the "private meetings with management" culture is now so entrenched that it will probably never be eliminated. The more practical step is for investors to understand that all the talk about a "level playing field" is ridiculous. But whether or not these meetings and conversations are kosher, there is still the question of whether they are a good use of a CEO's time. I would argue that they aren't. Investors and stocks are going to do what they are going to do, regardless of whether a CEO spends time kissing up to investors. And if a company puts up good numbers, the stock will take care of itself. As a smaller shareholder, I would far rather have the CEO of Apple spend time working on the company's products than having private conversations with bigger shareholders.

BofA Merrill Lynch Fund Manager Survey, DatastreamThe results from the August BofA Merrill Lynch Fund Manager Survey.Every month, BofA Merrill Lynch investment strategists survey 180 fund managers around the globe, who are responsible for a collective $516 billion in assets under management. The bottom line of the August survey, according to BAML chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett: Buy the "Crash Test Dummies." "In our view, the summer decline in bonds, [emerging markets] &amp; gold (the first of a likely series of “QE crashes”) has created short-term trading buy opportunities in these now very unloved assets," says Hartnett. "In contrast, [strong-dollar] plays (U.S./U.K. stocks, banks, discretionary) now appear relatively over-owned and likely underperformers near-term." In a note to clients, Hartnett gives a big-picture overview of what fund managers are thinking these days: Most are bullish on global growth... Net 72% expect stronger global economy, most bullish growth consensus since December '09, as Eurozone optimism reaches 9-year high and China expectations bounce. ...rotation to Cyclicals, but still short Resources Increased exposure to Banks and short-covering in Materials, funded by reduced exposure to the Utility sector. Tech the world's sector and investors appear convinced that U.S.-housing is likely to outperform China-housing (Chart 1). Most are bearish on Bonds...Treasuries likely to rally A remarkably low 3% of investors expect long-term bond yields to be lower in 12 months; no surprise asset allocation exposure to bonds at a 28-month low; fixed income concerns may explain why cash levels are still-high at 4.5%. Most are avoiding Emerging Markets...EM likely to rally 3rd largest [overweight] of U.S. equities in 10-years as U.S. [dollar] optimism remains very high; highest exposure to U.K. &amp; Eurozone stocks since December '02 &amp; January '08 respectively; contrarians should note decline in EM equity exposure to lowest since November '01. The best August contrarian trades are... ...long EM, short U.S.; long Gold, short [the dollar]; long Bonds, short Nasdaq; long Utilities, short Banks. Many of these trades are the opposite of what BAML has been advocating clients should be doing on a longer-term basis. For example, the bank has been bearish on Treasuries, and they expect a "Great Rotation" out of the asset class in the coming years. Meanwhile, the bank has also written extensively about the rise of the dollar and its expected resurgence over a similar timeframe.
REUTERSThe U.S. has charged two former JP Morgan traders over the $6 billion 'London Whale' trading lost in the bank's London Chief Investment Office last year. Charges against former managing directorÂ Javier Martin-ArtajoÂ and Julien Grout, a low-level trade, include wire fraud and conspiracy to falsify books and records. Bruno Iksil, the trader known as 'The London Whale', will not be charged as he has been cooporating with authorities. Dealbook reports that federal prosectutors and the FBI have been investigating Grout and Martin-Artajo's phone calls, e-mails and more related to this case for months. Both are out of the country. What is at issue here is whether or not the two traders intentionally hid significant losses over the course of the months-long trade. According the complaint, Both Grout and Martin-Artajo not only falsified books and records, he also falsified filings to the SEC â€” that's because some of their "false" information about the portfolio was included in a JPM investor report (8-k). The duo is also charged with wire fraud for giving false information to other JPM employees over e-mail and the phone starting in late March. That's when things really started going wrong in the portfolio. If JP Morgan's own internal report is accurate, then yes, it was known in Januaruy of 2012 that the portfolio in question was taking heavy losses (by April, the loss was $2 billion) but traders seemed confident they could hedge around it. The traders disagreed on how to deal with the bloodletting. They could either stop trading and see what the IG-9 would do, or build more hedges around it. They chose to build more hedges (pg 36 of JPM's report): ...he...advised another Synthetic Credit Portfolio trader not to trade IG-9 because he wanted to observe its behavior. He also advised a more senior trader of his plans, but the latter instructed him to trade because they needed to participate in the market to understand the price at which parties were actually willing to transact. More hedging, more complexity â€” the portfolio kept getting bigger and bigger. As a result, the CIO got spanked in February (pg 4): By the end of February, the Synthetic Credit Portfolio had experienced an additional $69 million in mark-to-market losses, from approximately $100 million (year-to-date through January) to $169 million (year-to-date through February). Grout especially had some angry phone calls with co-workers that didn't understand why he was not showing the profits and losses in his book, and even at the end of March he insisted that the trades hadn't been "overly aggressive." We'll all find out about that soon enough. And FYI, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara (the funniest attorney that is not at all joking) will be having a press conference about this today at 2:00 p.m.

REUTERS/Kyodo An aerial view shows workers wearing protective suits and masks work at a construction site (C) of the shore barrier to stop radioactive water from leaking into the sea, at the tsunami-crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Fukushima, in this photo taken by Kyodo, August 9, 2013.A string of new incidents at Fukushima show that more than two years after a tsunami crippled the nuclear facility, it remains a toxic time bomb, one that the Japanese believe plant owner TEPCO to be utterly incapable of managing.Â  The Wall Street Journal's Mari Iwata reported last night that 10 workers at Fukushima received high levels of radiation exposure after being sprayed at a misting station. That amount of contamination is five times the maximum level Tepco has set as its limit, but none of the workers appear to have inhaled radioactive particles, or reported any illness, [Japan's Nuclear Regulatory Agency] said. TEPCO says the incident poses no threat to the surrounding area as the plant's water supply is cut off from the region's, and that the water itself did not appear to be contaminated, but that they had not yet pinpointed the source of the stray radiation. This follows an earlier announcement that 300 tons of radioactive water are still seeping past barriers and into the Pacific every day. According to NPR's Geoff Brumfiel, the area around the plant is already a dead zone, and the ocean is likely to dilute much of the harmful impact of the leaks. But the revelations have shattered the already brittle notion that TEPCO Â had a handle on the situation. The FT's Jonathan Soble reported last month that it was clear TEPCO was withholding the true extent of the newly revealed leaks. Government officials and local fishermen criticized Tokyo Electric Power on Tuesday after it admitted the existence of the leak for the first time, weeks after regulators spotted the problem and days after the utilityâ€™s own analysis confirmed it. "The data disclosure was very slow, and that is extremely regrettable,â€ Toshimitsu Motegi, industry minister, told reporters. Yoshihide Suga, the chief cabinet secretary, also said Tepco should have responded more quickly. This shouldn't come as much of a surprise given the company (as well as the government itself) faced similar charges of foot-dragging in the aftermath of the March 2011 meltdown itself. TEPCO has effectively been neutered as a going concern by the incident. Estimates put the cost of the cleanup at $11 billion over 40 years. For a visual demonstration of this, here's their stock chart over the past few years: MarketWatch But Japan's Asahi Shimbun newspaper blasted the idea that the company should be allowed to restart one of its nuclear reactors to raise funds: TEPCO is planning to seek permission to restart its Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant in Niigata Prefecture in accordance with the existing rehabilitation plan. This is an outrageous idea, given what is happening in Fukushima.Â It beggars belief that TEPCO is even considering it.Â  An insolvent Fukushima is a problem that goes beyond corporate interests,Â the paper notes: TEPCO is confronted by massive burdens that far exceed its capability. If the situation is left unattended, it could have a negative effect on the reconstruction of stricken areasÂ and the power supply to the Tokyo metropolitan area. Believe it or not, the situation could actually get even worse. As in worse than the original accident itself â€” and possibly worse than Chernobyl. Later this year, TEPCO will attempt to remove 1,300 highly irradiated spent fuel rod bundles weighing 400 tons of "highly irradiated spent fuel" according to Reuters. Here's what happens if it's botched: The operation, beginning this November at the plant's Reactor No. 4, is fraught with danger, including the possibility of a large release of radiation if a fuel assembly breaks, gets stuck or gets too close to an adjacent bundle, said Gundersen and other nuclear experts. That could lead to a worse disaster than the March 2011 nuclear crisis at the Fukushima plant, the world's most serious since Chernobyl in 1986. No one knows how bad it can get, but independent consultants Mycle Schneider and Antony Froggatt said recently in their World Nuclear Industry Status Report 2013: "Full release from the Unit-4 spent fuel pool, without any containment or control, could cause by far the most serious radiological disaster to date." Somehow, those risks outweigh â€” or maybe simply equal â€” the impetus for the operation in the first place: Reactor No.4 remains highly unstable, and if another quake hits everything gets fried anyway. So far, the death toll from the meltdown itself (as opposed to the tsunami) remains a matter of debate. A May U.N. report said no one had died or even yet fallen ill, though Slate has explained that we still don't even have a precise mortality count from Chernobyl (it's hard to distinguish between exposure-induced and naturally occurring cancer). Â A Stanford study says it could ultimately lead to 1,300 cancer deaths. But mortality is likely to be compounded by the fact thatÂ Japan released record amounts of CO2 last year after it temporarily shuttered most of its other nuclear plants (which are carbon neutral). This thing just keeps going.

REUTERS/Nacho Doce The July producer price index came in flat on the month, missing expectations for a 0.3% rise. Core PPI (ex-food and energy) climbed 0.1%, missing expectations for a 0.2% rise.  On the year, PPI was up 2.1%, again falling shy of estimates for a 2.4% rise. Core PPI was up 1.2% on the year. PPI measures the average change in prices from the seller's perspective. Investors track this number because it acts as an indicator for commodity prices in the manufacturing sector which eventually trickle down to the consumer.
Chris Sloan/AirchiveWASHINGTON (Reuters) - AMR Corp's American Airlines and US Airways Group Inc could be in for a long and bruising courtroom battle against seasoned lawyers if they choose to keep fighting the U.S. Justice Department's objection to their merger. Several experts in antitrust law said in interviews that the aggressive stance taken by the Justice Department in the suit it filed in U.S. District Court in Washington signals a sincere intention to block the deal, not just a mere negotiating ploy to get concessions before possible future approval. If the Justice Department persuades a judge to agree, it will have scuttled an $11 billion deal intended to create the world's largest airline. The government argued that the merger would reduce competition for commercial air travel in local markets throughout the United States and cause passengers to pay higher airfares and receive less service. The department's Antitrust Division has been picking and winning some big fights in recent years. In July, it won a trial over e-book price-fixing against Apple Inc. In 2011, it successfully blocked a proposed $39 billion merger between AT&amp;T and T-Mobile USA. One sign that government lawyers are dead set on blocking the deal can be found in an appendix to its lawsuit, said Mark Ostrau, an antitrust lawyer in Mountain View, California. The appendix lists 1,043 airline routes between cities where, according to the Justice Department, the combined company would have a presumptively illegal monopoly or near monopoly. The routes between two cities - for example, Charlotte and Dallas - are known in the industry as "city pairs." There may be too many troublesome pairs for AMR and US Airways to resolve in a settlement, and that is something government lawyers must have known when they put the list in their suit, Ostrau said. "If you wanted something to resolve, you would not have listed more than 1,000 problematic city pairs," he said. Jonathan Lewis, an antitrust lawyer in Washington, called the Justice Department's suit "very powerful" because it quotes company documents and executives anticipating higher prices through consolidation. "If there were going to be a settlement, it probably would have happened already," Lewis said, adding that the outcome was still difficult to predict. AMR and US Airways said they would launch a "vigorous and strong defense" and called the Justice Department "wrong in its assessment of our merger." "Blocking this pro-competitive merger will deny customers access to a broader airline network that gives them more choices," the companies said in a joint statement. 'FULL-STOP INJUNCTION' SOUGHT Assistant Attorney General Bill Baer, the head of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division, on Tuesday outlined broad objections to the deal based on competition in the industry generally. "We learned during our investigation about what happened to competition from prior acquisitions, and as we look at the market today, it's not functioning as competitively as it ought to be," Baer told reporters on a conference call. Baer said he wanted nothing short of a "full-stop injunction" - meaning a court order preventing the merger - even if it means his staff spending months in court. "We don't file lawsuits unless we're prepared vigorously to defend them, and that's what we're doing right now," he said. The Justice Department gives parties to a merger several opportunities to respond to likely government objections, allowing them to submit documents and sit down with top department lawyers. The department followed that process in this case, Baer said. "I don't think it was a surprise to the parties," Baer said of the lawsuit. U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly was assigned to oversee the case. In 2001, she was assigned to oversee the penalty phase of the landmark U.S. antitrust case against Microsoft Corp. An appointee of Democratic President Barack Obama, Baer joined the Antitrust Division in January from the Washington law firm Arnold &amp; Porter. Private antitrust lawyers describe him as a self-assured leader in the field who does not shy from challenging cases. Under Baer and his predecessors, the division has coined a term - "litigation-ready" - to represent a new willingness to go to court, and it has built up its courtroom experience with the hiring of its first director of litigation, Mark Ryan. Although there is no hearing date set for the airline case, let alone a Justice Department trial team named, the government's courtroom lawyers are likely to include people like Ryan, who successfully argued the Apple trial last month. The efforts are designed to help the Antitrust Division avoid any repeat of a major loss in 2004, when it tried but failed to block Oracle Corp's takeover of PeopleSoft. AMR and US Airways will need to think hard if they are committed to following through on pledges to fight, said Evan Stewart, an antitrust lawyer in New York. "Time is not the friend of these merging companies. Litigation as a playing-out-the-clock process is something that helps the government," he said. (Editing by Will Dunham)

Citi tracks a measure known as the "economic surprise index" for various locales, which shows how economic data are progressing relative to the consensus forecasts of market economists. From Bloomberg: The Citigroup Economic Surprise Indices are objective and quantitative measures of economic news. They are defined as weighted historical standard deviations of data surprises (actual releases vs Bloomberg survey median). A positive reading of the Economic Surprise Index suggests that economic releases have on balance [been] beating consensus. The indices are calculated daily in a rolling three-month window. The weights of economic indicators are derived from relative high-frequency spot FX impacts of 1 standard deviation data surprises. The indices also employ a time decay function to replicate the limited memory of markets. So, what are the surprise indices saying right now? The stories will probably sound familiar. In the United States, surprises surged into positive territory in August for the first time since April. Business Insider/Matthew Boesler, data from Bloomberg The eurozone surprise index also recently surged into positive territory, too. Investors and analysts are now discussing a possible end to the debilitating recession in the currency bloc. Business Insider/Matthew Boesler, data from Bloomberg Surprises in China turned negative earlier this year and were forced lower by weak second-quarter economic data. With the release of the July economic data, surprises are trending back up again, but are still negative. Business Insider/Matthew Boesler, data from Bloomberg Japan's surprise index shows the clear waning of excitement surrounding "Abenomics," the Japanese administration's experimental program of economic stimulus, in recent weeks.

REUTERS/Keith BedfordAn interactive kiosk sit on display at the JC Penney Experience store in Times Square in New York March 2, 2006. The virtual store, which will be open for three weeks, allows shoppers to browse exclusive lines and purchase the company's full range of merchandise online at interactive kiosks. J.C. Penney Co. Inc. said on Thursday its February sales rose 2.3 percent at stores open at least a year.(Reuters) - It was a "century" deal, but in hindsight it was hardly the deal of the century. More than 17 years and a dozen credit downgrades ago, JCPenney Co Inc. joined an elite club in capital markets circles by issuing a rare 100-year bond. The deal from Penney, then sporting a mid-range investment-grade rating of "A" from Standard &amp; Poor's and coming off record holiday-season sales, matched the year's largest "century bond" deals at $500 million, but the company stood out as the only retailer in the mix. By all accounts the sale of the 7-3/8 percent notes due 2097, managed by Credit Suisse, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch, went smoothly. The future seemed bright: Penney was riding high on investor optimism about its $3.3 billion purchase of the Eckerd drug store chain months earlier and within 18 months its stock would be at then record highs. But 100 years makes for one long bet, particularly on a player in a sector as flighty as mass-market retailing, and it's been anything but smooth sailing since. Like the stock, Penney's bonds, long since fallen deep into junk status with a CCC- rating, have taken it on the chin as the store group's sales have plunged amid a disastrous pricing and marketing strategy and failed attempt to appeal to the more affluent shopper. Its recent related tussle with activist hedge fund investor Bill Ackman, and uncertainty about the status of its vendor financing deals, have further undermined investor confidence. It is now facing a very uncertain holiday season with a temporary CEO at the helm following its firing of Ron Johnson, the former Apple executive who was largely seen as the architect of its failed strategy. The 2097 bonds have fallen 21 percent in price since mid-May, and are currently trading at 67 cents on the dollar, near their lowest since the financial crisis. They offer a yield of 11.38 percent. By contrast, the average effective yield on bonds in the Bank of America Merrill Lynch CCC and Lower U.S. High Yield Index, an index of lower-rated junk bonds, is 9.77 percent. Some big names in the bond business can be counted among the casualties. Loomis Sayles &amp; Co. holds about $19.4 million of the bonds as of June 30, according to Emaxx, a bond investor tracking service owned by Thomson Reuters. Dan Fuss, vice chairman and portfolio manager at Loomis, said the firm, which has $190 billion in assets, is reassessing its position. "When you lose market share, it is difficult to stop the bleeding, especially in retail," Fuss said. Back in 1997, the Penney deal came to market in what turned out to be the banner year for "century bond" issuance. Following on IBM's &lt;IBM.N&gt; record $850 million deal in December 1996, ultra-long bond fever struck Wall Street and corporate treasurers alike, and an unprecedented 26 investment grade century bond sales totaling $7.12 billion hit the market over the next 12 months, according to IFR Markets data. Car makers Ford &lt;F.N&gt; and Chrysler both sold $500 million, as did Baby Bell operators Bell South and US West. Railroads Norfolk Southern &lt;NSC.N&gt; and Burlington Northern Santa Fe clocked in at $350 million and $200 million respectively, and Boston University raised $100 million. In all, IFR data shows 65 U.S. 100-year bonds with a face value of $16.29 billion have been issued since Walt Disney &lt;DIS.N&gt; and Coca-Cola &lt;KO.N&gt; debuted century deals on successive days in July 1993. Recent ultra-long issuance has been dominated by high-rated universities, which account for six of the 10 deals since the financial crisis, led by Massachusetts Institute of Technology's $750 million deal in May 2011, largely on the basis that they are more likely to be around in the next century than many companies. In fairness to Penney's bonds, few of the century bonds have fared well of late as the corporate bond market has been whipsawed by investor anxiety over the future of the U.S. Federal Reserve's massive stimulus program. High-grade bonds like IBM's 2096s, rated AA-, have dropped 18 percent in price since early May. Even MIT's AAA-rated notes due 2111 have shed 19.3 percent in price in that time, with their yield climbing nearly a full percentage point to 4.88 percent. Still, the questions around Penney's future suggest more volatility ahead. Its credit default swaps, insurance against a default, price a nearly 65 percent default probability in five years and 85 percent over 10 years, according to data from Markit. For some bond mavens, that's just too much risk to take on. Portfolio manager Bonnie Baha, who heads Global Developed Credit at DoubleLine, said the $57 billion bond house has had Penney bonds on its "avoid" list for years and doesn't buy the argument that Penney's swooning securities don't take into account the value of the retailer's real estate. "In the era of Amazon.com and other online retailing, I don't think much of legacy real estate assets of the Big Box stores," Baha said.

Great news. The Eurozone is back in growth. The fact that Europe is no longer getting worse is an important milestone. But things are dismal overall, and this chart from Philippe Waechter, the Chief Economist at Natixis Asset Management, tells a tragic story. First, after the initial financial crisis, European growth fell violently off trend (the red line). But then Eur compounded the financial crisis with a sovereign debt crisis, and so after returning to growth, the economy fell off even its second, sub-trend glide path. So since the crisis, Euro has fallen beneath two trend line: The original one, and then a new diminished one. The amount of catching up the Euro area needs to do is massive. Philippe Waechter
Hedge fund manager Bill AckmanÂ  called out Howard Schultz yesterday evening on Charlie Rose on PBS.Â  Schultz earlier ripped into Ackman for leaking letters for JCPenney's board in the press. Schultz, who is friends with the retailer's interim CEO Mike Ullman, called Ackman's actions "despicable" and blamed him for ruining the lives of thousands of JCPenney employees. Ackman, who said he's never spoken to Schultz, hinted that the Starbucks CEO may have leaked a memo he wrote to the press.Â  "I think he doesn't really understand the facts. He's a good friend of Mike Ullman, who sits on the board. You know the reality is Howard Schultz, when he brought in the new CEO-- the board brought in Jim Donald to be the CEO of Starbucks a number of years ago and things were going poorly. Howard Schultz wrote a memo to the board that was leaked to the press and it's not clear who leaked that memo to the press."Â  Back in 2007,Â a memo Schultz wrote to the press to then-CEO Jim Donald was leaked to the press. Â The board then ousted Donald and brought on Schultz again. Â  BILL ACKMAN: But ultimately it led to the replacement of Jim Donald withÂ Howard Schultz. And Howard Schultz -- CHARLIE ROSE: Or just returned to the company but he turned it around whenÂ he came back. BILL ACKMAN: He did an absolutely fabulous job. And -- but why did thatÂ memo end up being leaked to the press? UPDATE: Â It wasn't Schultz who leaked that memo.Â  @SallyPancakes Julia: The '07 Howard Schultz memo was leaked to me ... and it *didn't* come from Schultz. http:// http://t.co/e8iaqzE4Q1
One thing Iâ€™ve continually cited throughout Quantitative Easing is how the evidence between stock prices and QE is actually much less reliable than most presume. Â  The case I keep pointing to is Europe where the ECBâ€™s balance sheet expansion has coincided with many markets crashing (like the periphery stock markets). Â Nevermind that inflation has remained low. Â  There is this perpetual psychological belief that QE can cause stock prices to levitate â€“ as if nothing else is needed to support prices. Â That is probably true to some degree, but I am not so sure the effect is as powerful as some people seem to believe. The reason I bring this up is because Scott Krisiloff has a nice post showing exactly what weâ€™re talking about here: PragCap The ECB has a shrinkage problem anda stock market expansion. Â Which obviously goes against all of the myths that QEâ€™s â€œtaperingâ€ will necessarily coincide with declining stock prices. Â It all makes me wonder if this isnâ€™t just a big case of confirmation bias. Â If you canâ€™t find inflation in consumer prices then the default position is to argue that QE causes asset prices to rise. Â  All that â€œmoney printingâ€ has to â€œgo somewhereâ€ right? Â  Maybe notâ€¦.Now, I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s entirely irrational as markets are driven largely by psychology, but there are times when this myth seems to take on a life of its own. Â Maybe Europe proves that we need to temper our taper expectations and stop expecting so much from the Fedâ€™s policies? Â  Â And maybe it proves that the Bernanke Put is not as important as some people seem to think?
Robert JohnsonIt's the dead middle of August. And things are quiet. Markets have been pretty dull and lifeless lately, and today that's especially so. Stock indices are basically flat across Europe. Futures are a tad down in the US. Japan ended up having a nice rebound late in the day, and ended with a rally, but given the way the Nikkei bounces around, it was nothing to write home about. There is not a ton of crucial data in the US today, although PPI will be released.
