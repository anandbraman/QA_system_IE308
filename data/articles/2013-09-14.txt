Seventy-five years before the trillion-dollar bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in 2008, Franklin D Roosevelt had used his 1933 inauguration speech â€“ in the depths of the Great Depression â€“ to declare that the "money changers have fled from their high seats in the temple of our civilisation". He went on: "We may now restore that temple to the ancient truths. The measure of the restoration lies in the extent to which we apply social values more noble than mere monetary profit." In 2008, in the aftermath of the Lehman collapse, the words of the New Deal president were often quoted by those keen to rein in the excesses of Wall Street and the City. After Lehman there was no shortage of ideas on ways of restoring the temple, including breaking up the big banks into retail and investment arms, as they had been in the US under the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933. The reformers were not confined to the Occupy movement protesters who set up camps on Wall Street and by St Paul's cathedral. Paul Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, supported moves to prevent banks engaging in speculative trading that did not benefit their customers, while in the UK the coalition government backed plans to force banks to ringfence high street operations from their investment banking activities. The aim was to eradicate what Lord Turner, when he was chairman of the Financial Services Authority, had called the "socially useless" parts of the City and rein in the risk-taking that might one day require another taxpayer bailout. Five years on from the tumultuous collapse of Lehman â€“ which prompted a near meltdown of the global financial system â€“ Turner admits the socially useless activity he was concerned about has been only temporarily restrained. Indeed, to the public, the perception is that the City has got away lightly, especially compared with what happened to those blamed for the 1978-79 winter of discontent. Five years after that winter, when the trade unions were deemed to have taken Britain to the brink of economic chaos, the Thatcher government had taken a series of steps to tame organised labour. But capitalism's winter of discontent in 2008-09 led to no such seismic shift. Just six months after the mayhem caused by Lehman's collapse â€“ which quickly led to the rescue of HBOS by Lloyds, the bailout of Bradford &amp; Bingley and the near-demise of RBS â€“ an industry that loves acronyms had created a new one: BAB, standing for "bonuses are back". Five years on, the view of former City minister Lord Myners is that not a lot has changed: "The banks are still too big, too interconnected and too undercapitalised." He is not alone in fearing that too little has changed to prevent another crisis, and that lessons have not been learned. Turner, too, fears that history could repeat itself, and Alistair Darling, chancellor at the time of the bailouts, agrees: "As long as people think they can make money out of nothing, it will happen again." That is not to say there have not been changes. The Lehman crisis and the subsequent economic crisis led to a change in the political order and, in May 2010, to the first coalition government since the second world war. Bankers' heads rolled: Fred Goodwin â€“ now plain Mr after being stripped of his knighthood last year â€“ was the first to go, paying the price for the October 2008 bailout. The top bosses at HBOS were not far behind, and shortly afterwards those of Lloyds and Barclays were gone. The regulatory system discredited by the crisis has also been overhauled: the Financial Services Authority watchdog was shut down and replaced with a new Prudential Regulation Authority inside the Bank of England and a Financial Conduct Authority in the former offices of the City regulator. But this is not enough for some. Myners sees the regulatory changes as largely cosmetic. He says he never believed the regulatory architecture was to blame for the banking crisis, and adds that these changes are "quite modest". Modest they may be, but they are causing confusion. The debate about the structure of the banking industry and the amount of capital banks should hold is still raging. The government is still trying to decide whether RBS â€“ bailed out with Â£45bn of taxpayers' money in 2008 and 2009 â€“ should be broken up. And there's still no clear answer on how much capital banks should be required to hold, although a level was set in an international agreement known as the Third Basel Accord (Basel III), hammered out in Switzerland and scheduled to be introduced from this year. Turner, who has in the past said that banks' capital ratio should be higher (Basel is aiming at a minimum 7% by 2019; more for big firms), now says former Bank of England governor Lord King was correct in his obsession with this issue. "Mervyn was always a capital hawk, saying banks needed a lot more capital," Turner says. "In retrospect, he was rightâ€¦ If I was a benevolent dictator of a greenfield global economy, free to make decisions without worrying about either international negotiations or transition difficulties, I would go for much higher capital ratios even than Basel III." Sir John Vickers, who led the coalition's review into the future of banking and came up with the idea of ringfencing, last week called for capital ratios of 20% â€“ four times the amount of capital RBS was holding when it nearly collapsed, and more than double that required under international rules. But debate is still raging about how to measure that capital. The focus has shifted from a straightforward capital ratio â€“ which allows banks to use their own models to measure the risks they run â€“ to a leverage ratio, where banks are not allowed to make judgments about whether some assets are riskier than others. At the moment, that ratio is set at 3%. The debate has blown up a into row between the regulators and the banks, the latter arguing that being forced to hold more capital means they lend less to businesses and households. Using the leverage ratio has forced Barclays into a Â£5.8bn cash call â€“ the prospectus for which is due this week. This sum is less than the bank needed to find to escape a government bailout in 2008, but is still one of the largest ever by a UK bank. Myners and others, however, reckon that even this leverage requirement is too low. "A 3% leverage ratio is still very thin, yet the banks have been able to convince the media that it will cause them to reduce their lending [if it is any higher]," says Myners. He reckons that a mere 3% capital requirement (which enables a bank to lend more than 30 times as much as the capital it holds) is "simply planning for failure". Darling laments that the international call to action made in the immediate aftermath of the crisis has lost urgency as memories of the panic fades. Darling says: "My biggest regret is that the collective will that was there in 2008-09 had disappeared by 2010." Since the crisis, the reputation of bankers has been damaged even further by a range of scandals such as those over mis-sold payment protection insurance in the UK, the repossessions that followed the US sub-prime mortgage bond debacle and the rigging of Libor. Douglas Flint, chairman of HSBC â€“ which was itself hit with a Â£1.2bn fine for breaching money laundering rules in the US â€“ says the problems are more deep-seated: "The focus has been on capital because we can measure it. But the real issue is about culture." Attempts to change that culture focused on the bonus system. When the crisis hit, the finger was pointed directly at bankers' bonuses, which had encouraged a culture of risk-taking: bankers stood to earn huge potential rewards, but with no penalty for making losses and no threat of losing payments if deals went bad years later. The City regulator was one of the first in Europe to stop all-cash bonuses and demand that a proportion be paid in shares and spread over three years â€“ the rationale being that this will make bankers think more carefully about their long-term actions. Even so, in the first official audit of City pay, published in 2010, the regulator revealed that more than 2,800 topfinancial staff had been paid more than Â£1m in the year after the bailouts. Since then, data published by the European Banking Authority has shown that more than 2,400 bankers were paid more than â‚¬1m (Â£870,000) in 2011. Data from the Office for National Statistics shows that bonuses in the finance and insurance sector are heading back towards levels seen during the 2006-Â 07 boom, when they reached close to Â£20bn. And in the year to April 2013, some Â£14bn was paid out in bonuses in the financial sector. But another way to change banking culture is to change the ways banks operate. The Vickers proposals currently weaving their way through parliament require a ringfence to be erected between high street banks and "casino" investment banks. HSBC's Flint says this will show exactly where the risks lie. Andrew Bailey, deputy governor of the bank of England, welcomes the ringfence plan but adds: "It's not the answer on its own." While the Vickers proposals were more radical than many had expected after the May 2010 election, they are moderate compared with the Glass-Steagall reforms of the post-Depression era in the US, where full separation between investment banks and high street banks was mandatory â€“ a reform that lasted until 1999, when lobbying by investment banks saw it swept away. Yet even people who were directly involved in bailing out the banks have argued against such separation. Darling points out that a ringfence would not have stopped the collapses of Northern Rock or HBOS â€“ "bog-standard high street banks that got into trouble". Many now fear that more trouble is brewing. Myners says: "We would be naive to say we could not have another crisis in the next 10 years or so." Darling does not set a timeframe for a further crisis but fears it will come: "People will forget," the former chancellor says. "Once the people who were there in 2008 have left [their jobs], the banks will lose their institutional memory." Senior Bank of England director Andy Haldane is also concerned about a forgetful City. In a speech this month he said: "Financial crises underscore the importance of a policymaker with institutional memory. This reduces the risk of disaster myopia, of ignoring worrying dots on distant horizons, of being information-rich yet attention-poor, of forgetting fat tails. To misquote Mark Twain, although crises do not repeat themselves, they do rhyme." Areas of concern now include the shadowy, unregulated banking sector in China and the weak lenders in the eurozone, many of which are still being kept afloat by the European Central Bank. "In Europe there is complete failure to deal with the banks apart from on a piecemeal basis," says Darling. He points out that much of the money was lost because of good old-fashioned lending errors rather than "fancy footwork". This means there is reason to fear such mistakes could be repeating themselves â€“ in, for example, the schemes created by Chancellor George Osborne to get the housing market moving. As much as he insisted last week that he was not creating a housing bubble, a record number of people are now employed in the estate agency business, housebuilders are once again reporting queues to snap up new homes and prices are rising at their fastest rate since the 2006 peak. Business secretary Vince Cable last week said Osborne should consider postponing the next stage of Help to Buy. Darling is not impressed either: "The risk is putting more in people's pockets to chase the housing stock that's there. I am worried that will create another housing bubble where people think houses are worth more than they are." Turner puts its more bluntly: "The cure for this hangover, it seems, is the hair of the dog that bit us." This article originally appeared on guardian.co.uk

SquareOne EntertainmentVince Offer, known as "TheShamWow guy.""The ShamWow guy," Vince Offer, has returned after a sex scandal to clean up his act with a new product, "InVinceable." It isn't just a six-in-one kitchen cleaner, though. It's a comeback. Four years after getting into a slugfest with an alleged prostitute—an incident that spawned a cringe-worthy mug shot and headlines like "ShamWow Guy Beats Up Cannibal Hooker"—the infomercial pitchman who became famous as an irreverent version of Billy Mays is launching a new product that's supposed to scrub persistent stains. Offer says the black mark on his name after the hooker incident had a silver lining. "It probably saved my life," he said. In an interview with NBC News, the infomercial star talked about his rise, his tumble, and his hopes for a return. "Fame didn't change me," said Offer, 49, but, "money can buy anything." And with it, "you want more girls around you." Becoming Vince Born in Israel as Offer Shlomi, the future spiky-haired pitchman grew up in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, in a Jewish and Italian neighborhood. Looking for something "less foreign," he started going by "Vince Offer" in 1986. Crude humor flowed freely on the streets and stoops of Brooklyn back then, said Offer. "I grew up thinking everyone liked d*** jokes." (Read more: First interview with Vince from ShamWow!) In the 1970s he was fascinated by the salesman in the "Crazy Eddie" commercials. But he was no "Crazy Eddie" in school. Offer says he was an average student and a little shy. Lazy he wasn't, though. He said when he and his friends would shovel neighbors' driveways for cash in the winter, his pals would stop after two hours. He'd keep shoveling until 10 p.m. But Los Angeles beckoned. He quit high school at 17 and left Brooklyn for the West Coast. The L.A. hustle To make money, he sold an early version of the "Slap Chop" food chopper at flea markets. From its sales, he made the "Underground Comedy Movie" in 1996, redeveloping shorts he made in the 1980s with a friend for cable access. With sketches like "Miss America Bag Lady Pageant," and "Flirty Harry," a parody of "Dirty Harry" with a beyond flamboyant detective, Offer said, "I found my calling." "The hipster audience didn't like it," said Offer, but he enticed skateboarders and "freaks" from the sidewalk to showings at theaters he booked himself. Hipsters weren't the only hard sell. Film distributors didn't bite either. By 2002, broke, Vince was selling the ShamWow and Slap Chop at flea markets, saving enough to make an infomercial for his movie. He bought time from 2 a.m. to 4 a.m. on Comedy Central. It made money, he said, and something clicked. With direct TV marketing, he didn't have to please the gatekeepers of taste to make a sale. (Read more: The Shake Weight hits $40 million In sales) In 2007, he took what worked for "Underground Comedy Movie" and shot an ad of the ShamWow pitch he had relentlessly honed. To the demonstrations used by other marketers for two decades, he added his sideways grin and Brooklyn charm. Vince said that his secret is to be "very vanilla, with a touch of inappropriate." The ad exploded infomercial conventions and went viral, landing him in the pop culture zeitgeist, and by his own account, selling "millions." He refused to answer questions about how much money he raked in, but the chamois cloths can be bought wholesale in bundles of three for $.50. Vince sold them in packs of eight for $19.95, plus shipping and handling. The infomercial machine Like most infomercial producers, Vince didn't invent the products he's known for pitching. He found them by scouring flea markets, trademarked better names, and made funnier ads. Because Vince owns his products, he can "push the envelope" more than other pitchmen, delivering "schticky" jokes and sexual innuendos with "cocky confidence," said Kevin Harrington, chairman of infomercial clearing house As Seen On TV, Inc. While most demonstrators focus on function, "what he tries to come up with are demos that will make you laugh," said Harrington. But jokes aren't enough. Infomercial producers have to find a reliable factory, get them a mold or drawings, and hire a fulfillment facility, a telemarketer to take orders and a media buyer to purchase air time. Then there's packaging, shipping, returns, customer service, an Internet storefront and more. A product that sells for $20 usually costs $2 to $3 wholesale. After overhead costs, the hope is to squeeze out a $4 to $5 profit. A producer can also sell a commercial to a distributor, who then can sell the product to a retailer such as Wal-Mart. The per item profits for the producer are smaller, typically up to a $1 commission, but the volume can be massive. In some rare cases, royalties can add up to the millions. Fall from infomercial grace In 2009, while living in Miami, Offer hired an employee to take over processing orders. He thought it allowed him to let loose a little, he said. Then, in February, he got into a fight with an alleged prostitute in his hotel room, according to police documents. Offer said it happened after a 12-hour drinking binge. According to the police report, the woman bit his tongue and wouldn't let go. Vince struck her with his fists. The pair was arrested for aggravated battery, but prosecutors didn't press charges. Attempts to reach Vince's co-defendant were unsuccessful. "I have to take full responsibility," said Vince. (Read more: Move over, Shamwow and Snuggie) The viral forces that had made him famous soon made him notorious—thanks to the excruciating mug shot. After the arrest, he cut down on partying and recommitted to his work. He developed a new infomercial for a washable lint roller, "The Schticky." At the same time, he produced a movie, "InAPPropriate Comedy," a rework and expansion of his previous film. The New York Times called the new movie "stunningly awful." Vince says it will break even by 2014 thanks to overseas and video-on-demand sales. The tagline for Vince's new kitchen cleaner is, "Your messes may be tough, but they're not InVinceable." The remake Now, after a career built on remaking other's products, Vince Offer is remaking himself. He says he's cut back to an occasional glass of wine. He and his girlfriend of two years recently returned from a three-week trip to Switzerland—the first break he's taken in months. The "InVinceable" kitchen cleaner is scheduled to come out in mid-September. Afterward, Offer is considering a move behind the camera and producing infomercials starring others. Unlike his earlier products, Offer says he didn't find the new one as an established flea market seller. Instead, he thought of the name first and designed a product around it. It will take more than a new liquid cleanser to scrub away the hotel incident from the ShamWow Guy's name. He hopes it's not indelible. "People understand you make mistakes in life," said Vince. "Hopefully I won't make another mistake." —By NBC's Ben Popken. Email him at ben.popken@nbcuni.com or follow@bpopken or benpopkenwrites.com.

This Wednesday, the Federal Reserve will conclude its two-day Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, which is when economists expect the Fed to announce the tapering of its monthly purchases of $85 billion worth of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed bonds. These large-scale asset purchases, also referred to as quantitative easing (QE), have been intended to keep interest rates low to stimulate the economy. And the tapering represents confidence that the economy is indeed getting better. "We think it will trim Treasury purchases $10 to $15 billion in a sequence that will take nine months to get to zero net acquisitions," said Morgan Stanley's Vincent Reinhart. "Fed officials have said over and over again that the balance-sheet decision is made meeting-by-meeting and is data-driven. In the event, the payroll employment report for August must have proved a disappointment to them and the back revisions pointed to less progress in hiring than they hoped. A small tapering and tilting toward Treasuries acknowledges those inconvenient facts." But what if interest rates start surging in an a way that threatens the economy? Well, the Fed has other tools. Here's Reinhart: ...True, Fed officials have used QE in the past to signal the Fed’s willingness to keep policy accommodative for a considerable period. But that was then. Now they can signal the intent to keep policy accommodative—the forward guidance so much in vogue among central bankers—by adjusting their threshold on unemployment or introducing a lower bound on inflation. With this heavy-caliber ammunition in reserve in the event yields back up uncomfortably later in the year, they can put QE on the road to retirement. For the incumbents at the Fed, starting now puts a body in motion that will stay in motion for the next leader. Currently, the Fed employs an unemployment rate threshold of 6.5% and an inflation rate threshold of 2.5% to help guide monetary policy. In other words, as long as unemployment stays high and prices remain low, the Fed will continue to do what it can to keep rates low. And QE isn't the only tool it has to accomplish this goal.
New York Fashion Week coverage tends to focus on the ladies, but men's fashion is a big deal on the runways, too. The majority of men's collections shown this year were athletic and preppy. There were also a lot of printed pants, jackets, and suits in the mix, hinting that men's style is going to get more flashy in 2014. The one trend we couldn't stand? All of the baggy pants at Michael Kors and — to a lesser extent — Marc Jacobs. Tailoring should always be in style. Check out the top seven trends for Spring/Summer 2014 below. Getty Images (Left: Malan Breton; Center: Billy Reid; Right: Ovaida &amp; Sons) How To Wear Them: Sparingly. Double-breasted blazers are hard to pull off, and if the cut is too baggy, they can look like a bad '80s vintage find. "It should be tailored short in the body and fitted well around the waist, so I would only recommend it for those well-versed about style and fit," The Buying Director at online menswear retailer MR PORTER Toby Bateman previously advised us. Getty Images (Left: David Hart; Center: Todd Snyder; Right: Mark McNairy) How To Wear Them: There were lots of different printed jackets this year, from plaid to floral. Even camo made a resurgence. Pair a patterned jacket with solid-colored shorts or pants. If you're style savvy, throw a contrasting print in the mix with a button-down shirt. Getty Images (Left: Michael Bastien; Center: Ernest Alexander; Right: David Hart) How To Wear Them: Printed pants have been really popular in women's fashion for the last few years, and now they're inching into the men's market. Use the same rules as printed jackets and keep things minimal, and make sure your pants are well-tailored so they don't end up looking like you wore PJs to the office. Getty Images (Left: Son Jung Wan; Center: Billy Reid; Right: Diesel Black Gold) How To Wear Them: All-white suit combos were at a wide mix of shows, including the edgy Diesel Black Gold, the eccentric Billy Reid, and the preppy Black Sheep by Brooks Brothers collections. The trick with wearing all white is to make sure textures contrast to keep it from becoming tacky. A white cotton shirt looks good with a linen suit, a white t-shirt balances out a silk jacket, etc. Getty Images (Left: Nautica; Center: DKNY; Right: Michael Bastien) How To Wear Them: Choose a pair of pants that fit you well, put on some awesome shoes, and just go for it. Of course, this style works better with casual pants like chinos and jeans than with suit attire, so keep that in mind. Getty Images (Left: GENERAL IDEA; Center: David Hart; Right: Nautica) How To Wear Them: Whether horizontal, vertical or diagonal, color-blocked patterns are a casual and preppy look for the spring. Treat these like your new classic black t-shirt and wear them with all your favorite pants and shorts. Getty Images (Clockwise from top: Tim Coppens; J. Crew; Shades of Grey by Micah Cohen; Ovaida &amp; Sons; AllSaints; Calvin Klein) How To Wear Them: By far the biggest trend from New York Fashion Week was men's bomber jackets. Whether they're leather, color-blocked, wool, or athletic, these jackets go with everything. When you go shopping for one, make sure the sleeves don't hang past your upper wrist, and that the coat has a slim silhouette to keep it from looking too much like a bulky Letterman jacket.
ReutersIndia has been on of the most exciting emerging-market economies in recent decades. But its massive population combined with rapid economic growth has also created plenty of unusual challenges related to bureaucracy, infrastructure, and crime.

"The announcement of the changes shows the absurdity of the index. 'The index changes were prompted by the low stock price of the three companies slated for removal and the Index Committee's desire to diversify the sector and industry group representation of the Index,' the company said. Of course, the per-share price of a stock has absolutely nothing to do with its size, importance or representativeness. Bank of America is being booted, it would seem, for its sub-$15 per-share price, in favor of Goldman Sachs with a $164 share price. But Bank of America is a way bigger company! Its total market capitalization is $155.6 billion, to $74.5 billion for Goldman. It has 257,000 employees, to 32,000 for Goldman. It is engaged in banking and lending activity in basically every community in America, as opposed to Goldman's specialty investment banking business. But when you find yourself in the archaic trap of weighing companies based on their per-share price, that's the kind of absurdity you end up with." However, these changes highlight a much bigger issue to investors.  I recently wrote an a article entitled "Why You Can't Beat The Index" which covered the variety of flaws of how benchmark indexes are calculated and the effect on portfolios. "The sad commentary is that investors continually do the wrong things emotionally by watching benchmark indexes. However, what they fail to understand is that there are many factors that affect a 'market capitalization weighted index' far differently than a 'dollar invested portfolio.'"  Specifically I covered the impact of the "substitution effect" on the index and the inherent "replacement effect" on your portfolio. The upcoming changes to the Dow Jones Industrial Average highlights the importance of these effects on portfolios that are benchmarked to an index. In order to demonstrate this particular issue we have to make some assumptions.  Most investors don't generally build a "price weighted" portfolio, which is a major flaw of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, but rather build portfolios by either buying round lots or investing rounded dollar amounts.  For our example we will assume that an individual invests a total of $300,000 dollars equally into each of the 30 stocks that comprised the Dow Jones Industrial Average as of November 1, 2005.   Furthermore, the portfolio will be managed exactly like the index and will only be changed when changes to the index are made.  (For purposes of this example only capital appreciation will be utilized.) Here is where the problems begin.  On February 19, 2008, just prior to onset of the financial crisis, the good folks at S&amp;P Dow Jones indices, swapped out Honeywell and Altria for Bank of America and Chevron.  In hindsight, I am quite sure that the decision to swap out Honeywell for Bank of America was regretted considering what happened next.  However, the important point is that when the two issues were swapped out there was no change to the underlying value of the index due to the way it is calculated.  However, the portfolio experienced a significant negative impact.  In order to adjust the portfolio the shares of Honeywell and Altria had to be sold and then new shares of Bank of America and Chevron had to be purchased.  The original $10,000 investment into Honeywell had grown to $13,367 but the same investment in Altria had fallen to just $2,275.  Therefore, since there was a net loss of $4,358 between the two positions, only $15,642 was able to be reinvested in the two new companies.  In September of 2008 it was American International Group's turn to be swapped out for Kraft Foods.  While this swap again didn't change the value of the index it resulted in a 95% loss in the sale of AIG in the portfolio. Then, as the financial crisis ended and the markets began to recover, Citigroup and General Motors, were swapped out for Cisco Systems and Travelers in June of 2009.  These two swaps resulted in net losses for the portfolio of roughly 93% and 85% respectively. The next change came in September of 2012 as Kraft Foods was swapped out for United Healthcare.  Once again there was no change to the value of the index but the impact to the portfolio was at least positive this time showing a 20% gain. Since the most recent changes do not actually occur until September 20, 2013 we will assume that the upcoming changes occurred as of the close on September 11th.  Therefore, the substitutions of Nike, Goldman Sachs and Visa resulted in portfolio losses of roughly 69% in Alcoa, 66% on Bank of America and 17% for Hewlett-Packard.  The following two charts show you the difference in returns from $300,000 invested in the index versus a portfolio benchmarked to the index.  Lance Roberts This is the impact of the "substitution and replacement" effects.  During the period of the analysis the drags created by the loss of capital in the portfolio resulted in a net return difference of 28.85% versus 45.54% for the Dow Jones index.  This effect is magnified over longer periods of time.  While Wall Street wants you to compare your portfolio to the "index" so that you will continue to keep money in motion, which creates fees for Wall Street, the reality is that you can NEVER beat a "benchmark index" over a long period.  This is due to the following reasons: 1) The index contains no cash 2) It has no life expectancy requirements - but you do. 3) It does not have to compensate for distributions to meet living requirements - but you do. 4) It requires you to take on excess risk (potential for loss) in order to obtain equivalent performance - this is fine on the way up, but not on the way down. 5) It has no taxes, costs or other expenses associated with it - but you do. 6) It has the ability to substitute at no penalty – but you don’t. 7) It benefits from share buybacks – but you don’t. In order to win the long term investing game your portfolio should be built around the things that matter most to you. - Capital preservation - A rate of return sufficient to keep pace with the rate of inflation. - Expectations based on realistic objectives.  (The market does not compound at 8%, 6% or 4%) - Higher rates of return require an exponential increase in the underlying risk profile.  This tends to not work out well. - You can replace lost capital - but you can't replace lost time.  Time is a precious commodity that you cannot afford to waste. - Portfolios are time-frame specific.  If you have a 5-years to retirement but build a portfolio with a 20-year time horizon (taking on more risk) the results will likely be disastrous. The index is a mythical creature, like the Unicorn, and chasing it takes your focus off of what is most important - your money and your specific goals.  Investing is not a competition and, as history shows, there are horrid consequences for treating it as such.  So, do yourself a favor and forget about what the benchmark index does from one day to the next.  Focus instead on matching your portfolio to your own personal goals, objectives, and time frames.  In the long run you may not beat the index but you are likely to achieve your own personal goals which is why you invest in the first place.
It's a question all startups have to answer between giant fundraises and figuring out business models.  Some growing companies, like Twitter and Facebook, handle adolescence well.  For others it's awkward and takes serious soul searching to find a place in the business world.  Klout is one of those companies.  In early 2012, the social-importance ranking engine was on fire. Kleiner Perkins, Microsoft, and other big-name backers pumped $30 million into Joe Fernandez's company at a valuation worth hundreds of millions of dollars.  Then Klout vanished from headlines. Last week it reappeared. The news wasn't good.  Klout's COO, Emil Michael, resigned. He left for Uber, the latest red-hot startup worth billions of dollars, to be its SVP of Business. Michael remains on Klout's Board of Directors. Losing Michael as COO was one of a few snags the company has faced since its 2012 fundraise. The rumor mill has started to churn. Why did Michael leave? Is the company burning too much money? Does it have a real business or revenue? Are investors fed up?  Is Klout failing? And so on. We spoke candidly with Klout's CEO Joe Fernandez and others who are close to the company.  Klout isn't dead. It is soul searching. Joe Fernandez KloutJoe Fernandez, CEO of Klout Klout is a 5-year-old company that was devised while its founder, Joe Fernandez, lay in a hospital bed. His mouth was wired shut following jaw surgery, so he used sites like Twitter and Facebook to communicate. It was then that he realized the power of social media platforms, and how much information people were providing about themselves. "It was amazing to me that the people I trusted the most, I could tell them anything instantly from my phone [on Facebook or Twitter] and it would have an impact on them. And ... what they were saying would have an impact on me," Fernandez told Mashable in an early interview.  "I don't know if it was the pain relievers but I got really obsessed with the idea that, for the first time, word of mouth was scalable and the data was there to measure it." For the first few years, Fernandez worked on the startup by himself. Friends didn't like his idea and refused to quit their jobs to join him. But Fernandez was determined. He  shipped himself off to Singapore for four months and lived on a developer's couch while the beta version of Klout was built. Klout now pulls data for half-a-billion people on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and other social media sites. It crunches all of the information, highlights topics where people are most influential, and generates a score for everyone between 1 and 100. The higher the score, the more influential a person is. Marketers use these scores to target their ads to industry leaders, whether it is a mom who has pull in her town's PTA, or a CEO running a big-name company. Justin Bieber used to have a perfect Klout score, nearly double that of President Barack Obama. He's still up there with a score of 95, four points behind Obama. From the beginning, Klout's mission to rank people based on importance was controversial. Fernandez recalls presenting on stage at New York Tech Meetup one week after he launched Klout.  "I remember walking to the event and being terrified," Fernandez told Mashable. "I'm going to get in front of an audience of New Yorkers and tell them I've developed the algorithm that tells them how important all these people are." As Klout grew, so did the controversy surrounding it. Klout scores created competition; everyone wanted to have a higher score than friends and colleagues. But in 2011, when bloggers learned Justin Bieber had a perfect Klout score of 100, the controversy exploded. President Barack Obama had a lowly score of 58. Klout's algorithms were unreliable, the media screamed. "There was a point where I was like, 'The next person who asks me about Justin Bieber I’m punching in the face,'" Fernandez joked to Business Insider last year. Klout tweaked its scoring algorithms to measure 400 signals, like Wikipedia pages and Bing searches, in addition to social media activity. It wrote a detailed explanation about how scores are created, and it got a big vote of confidence from investors to the tune of $30 million. Notable venture capital firms such as Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, Venrock, and Institutional Venture Partners invested. Microsoft did too. Finally, even its most vocal skeptics eased up. "Klout has been one of my go-to punchlines for some time now," TechCrunch founder and CrunchFund investor Michael Arrington wrote in August 2012. "I’ve changed my mind. So much so that CrunchFund has now invested in Klout, and we’re big believers in what they’re doing...They’ve relaunched the product and a lot of the tricks that people used to game the system are gone. And better, Justin Bieber is no longer considered the most influential person in the world on Klout." Once the controversy around Klout died down, so did much of its press.  "The controversy surrounding Klout is why it was in the conversation a year or two ago," Emil Michael, who served as Klout's COO until last week, told Business Insider. "Controversy does not equal momentum." When buzzy startups vanish from the press it can mean they're heads down, working. Or it can mean they've died. Instagram/Klout"You hear anything about Klout lately?" I recently asked a source. "Nope," the person replied. I didn't buy it. "I understand they're on the struggle bus a bit," I prodded. A "struggle bus" is a now-common phrase for a difficult situation. The source knew what I meant and my cool-kid slang made the person cave. Yes, this person said, the struggle bus assessment was fair. Part of Klout's problem is that it's two businesses in one. First, it has a consumer business, the Klout scores that you're probably familiar with. Then and it has a lesser known enterprise business. With enterprise clients, CMOs can use Klout as a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) tool. They also use it to offer advertising promotions to influential people through "Perks." The combination means Klout has massive business potential. But Klout needs to focus, and it's hard to know which opportunity to pursue first. Investors are torn too. "Everyone thinks they have the idea for the perfect business model for us," Fernandez says. Some Klout investors think the company should focus on enterprise and charge CMOs for CRM tools or social media analytics. Their logic is simple. More than 200,000 companies use Klout for Business, a suite of enterprise tools that rolled out in March. There are 10,000 businesses using Klout's API. There have been 500 Klout Perk campaigns. In addition, Klout has powerful partnerships with Salesforce and Microsoft.  Klout's API is an impressive story alone. Klout's database is pinged a whopping 60 billion times per month, or 2 billion times per day, and Microsoft's API calls aren't even included in that count. Gnip, a data reseller that has full-access to Twitter's archives, generates a lot of the API hits. It helps other companies integrate with Klout's public API.  The 60 billion number puts Klout's API usage up there with Google and Facebook. Only one person on Klout's staff works on the API, so there's room for the already-massive product to grow.  Companies are interested in Klout's data for two reasons. Others investors think Klout should buff up the consumer product, Klout scores, since it needs users to survive. "Klout is very much like LinkedIn in that it will always need a consumer base," Michael says. While Klout can score people who haven't linked their social media accounts to the website, it unlocks infinitely more data once they've granted access to Instagram, Facebook, Foursquare and other profiles.  No matter which business Klout tackles first, some of its investors will be frustrated. Fernandez admits his team hasn't found the perfect product to offer yet, but early revenue signs are promising. Even with an imperfect product, Fernandez says Klout will generate more than $10 million this year; it is expected to double that revenue next year and possibly break even. Foursquare is a good comparison, because it's a data company that spent the past year testing a suite of advertising products too. In 2012, Foursquare's trial advertising solutions only generated $2 million. This year the tweaked products will generate $10-20 million, about as much as Klout's accidental revenue. Foursquare's staff is twice the size of Klout's 70-person team and it has raised almost three times as much money, $112 million versus $45 million.  Neither Klout nor Foursquare rival Twitter and Facebook's early revenue. Twitter was able to generate ~$45 million the first year it offered advertising, according to eMarketer.  Facebook generated $150 million a year after it ramped up its advertising business. For reasons unknown to even Fernandez, Klout has been experiencing sharp growth abroad, particularly in Japan. The sudden spike attracted a Japanese investor who was eager to introduce Klout to the market there. The investor led a small, $5 million round in the company less than two months ago. Did the company need the money because it was spending too much and in danger of running out? Fernandez says no. He took the investment for strategic, not cash flow, reasons, because he wants to beef up Klout's Asian presence.  He watches Klout's burn rate closely and feels confident that his company has plenty of millions left to run on. Fernandez also says there are no layoffs in Klout's near future. Klout has at least 18 months worth of money in the bank. That's healthy; startup advisor and blogger Martin Zwilling says investors like each funding round to last between one year and 18 months. Former Klout COO Emil Michael While Klout still has kinks to work out, its business undeniably shows promise. It hasn't raised or burned too much money, it still attracts investors, CMOs are clamoring to use it, and its API traffic is massive. So why did its COO, Emil Michael, leave last week? Emil Michael joined Klout 17 months ago. Prior to joining the company, he worked with a number of startups on their business strategy, including Flipboard and GroupMe, which was acquired by Skype. He also worked alongside the Secretary of Defense.  A friend described Michael as a "business rock star." Those words could also be used to describe Uber CEO Travis Kalanick. Uber, an on-demand driver and logistics startup, is one of the hottest private companies right now.  Kalanick and Michael have known each other for more than two years. They were introduced by Bill Gurley of Benchmark Capital, who is also Michael's long-time mentor. Uber spent six weeks pursuing Michael before he agreed to become its SVP of Business. Kalanick made Michael an offer he couldn't refuse. The gossip is that Michael's package was extremely compelling. One source familiar with the situation says it could be worth as much as $20 million given Uber's current $3.5 billion valuation and promising future. When I floated the $20 million figure to Michael he laughed. "No," he said firmly. Uber also says the figure is "way" off. Michael wouldn't give a formal comment about his pay package but he did provide some color. His stock options will vest over time, just like any other startup employee. He also cautioned that Uber's current valuation can't be used to determine the worth of his stock options. Investors and employees are given different kinds of stock. Plus, Michael is modest. He says he isn't a "count your chickens kind of guy." "It is a really exciting deal," Michael said simply of Uber's offer and potential. "There's no other company I'd leave [Klout] for ... If Uber fulfills the promise that was exemplified by the last round they hit, lots of people will do well financially." Fernandez isn't mad about the departure. If anything, he's proud Uber looked to Klout for talent; it also poached executives from Facebook and Google.  "As Emil's friend, if I could imagine the perfect job in the world for him, it's [the Uber one]," says Fernandez. "It's a bummer to lose him, but it was cool seeing our name up there with Facebook and Google."  Fernandez says he won't be actively hiring to fill the COO position. He did recently hire a CTO and a VP of Product, though.   Fernandez knows the vision for Klout, even if his current product is imperfect. He wants it to become the ultimate conversation starter for brands. "We think we have the opportunity to own earned media," Fernandez says.  "Earned media" is essentially word-of-mouth advertising on networks like Facebook and Twitter. It's the ability to get people talking about brands because they want to, not because they are paid to.  "We put products in the hands of influencers and the influencers create noise around it," Fernandez says.  Klout ran an earned media partnership with American Airlines in May. People with qualifying Klout scores were invited to use the airline's 40 worldwide lounges, even if they were flying with a competitor. The offer was well received; the announcement post generated 61 comments and nearly 1,000 retweets from genuinely excited people. It was covered on numerous media outlets including Ad Age, CNBC and Yahoo. Klout has run hundreds of these campaigns or "Perks." There are 30 brands testing a new earned media product too.  But Fernandez admits Klout is still fighting its way through a period Fred Wilson calls "the mess."   Fred Wilson is a partner at Union Square Ventures, a firm that invested in Twitter, Foursquare and Etsy. He likened startups to teenagers back in 2007. "Startups come out of the womb with the same bright shiny hopeful optimism as kids do ... then they hit their ugly adolescent period," Wilson wrote then. "They start to doubt themselves, they get zits, they get distracted with other things ... [To survive adolescence] you have to face the doubts, you have to admit that some of the things you've done were wrong, you often have to cut back the ambition and focus on the little things that are working. That takes leadership." Fernandez anticipates another 60 days of mess. Then Klout will be set up for a better 2014. To Fernandez, a startup's figure-it-out period is nothing to be ashamed of. Creating a bold business isn't always pretty. "The [adolescence phase is] painful," Fernandez wrote to Business Insider. "Our ecosystem loves to over-hype startups and then punish them for somehow not redefining how we think of growth trajectories. "There will be the occasional Snapchat, Instagram and Pinterest, but these are like the kids we all knew in school who skipped a grade. Just because they are exceptional doesn't mean that everything else is a failure. There are a bunch of companies that are going to stumble through figuring things out but will eventually find their way to a big outcome.  "If your vision is to build something big and bold that has never been done before, it's likely going to take time. Any long journey can look like failure when you are only half way through."
blackberry 10 alicia keysNEW YORK (Reuters) - A handful of potential bidders, including private equity firms, are lining up to look at BlackBerry Ltd, but initial indications suggest that interest is tepid and buyers are eyeing parts of the Canadian smartphone maker rather than the whole company, several sources familiar with the situation said. Private equity firms are mostly interested in businesses such as BlackBerry's operating system and the patents around its keyboard, two of the sources said. However, one possibility is for a Canadian pension fund to team up with an investor to buy the whole company, which is currently worth a little more than $5 billion, one of the sources said. BlackBerry's biggest shareholder, Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd, has approached several large Canadian investment funds about forging a deal to take the smartphone maker private, Reuters reported last week. Fairfax has a 10 percent stake, and its chairman and chief executive, Prem Watsa, has left BlackBerry's board already to avoid any possible conflict of interest as the company assesses its strategic options. Nevertheless, in recent days a few private equity firms have signed confidentiality agreements or have agreed to meetings with the company to gain access to the company's books, the sources said, adding that the sale process was expected to start in a few weeks. BlackBerry declined to comment. The apparent lack of interest among private equity firms in the whole company underscores the challenges BlackBerry has been facing in competing with rivals such as Apple Inc's iPhone and devices using Google Inc's Android technology. Its new BlackBerry devices hit store shelves this year just as the high-end smartphone segment was showing signs of saturation in markets such as the United States. Samsung Electronics recently reported results that fell shy of expectations, while Apple earlier this year reported its first quarterly profit decline in more than a decade. The new BlackBerry device has so far failed to gain traction with consumers, and the company - which pioneered mobile email with its first smartphones and email pagers and was once a stock market darling - has seen its shares plummet. Its market value has fallen to $5.4 billion, from $84 billion at its peak in 2008. Shares closed down 1.4 percent at $10.28 on the Nasdaq on Friday. Last month, the company said it was weighing its options, which could include an outright sale, after Reuters first reported that company's board was warming up to the possibility of going private. Industry sources said several of the biggest private equity firms and some of the Asian hardware makers had decided against a deal for the company. Still, the sources added some BlackBerry's assets could be of interest to buyers. According to analysts, BlackBerry's assets include a shrinking, yet well-regarded services business that powers its security-focused messaging system, worth $3 billion to $4.5 billion; a collection of patents that could be worth $2 billion to $3 billion; and $3.1 billion in cash and investments. Even at a conservative estimate, that is more than the company's $5.4 billion market value. Analysts said the smartphones that bear its name have little or no value and it might cost $2 billion to shut the unit that makes them. Many hurdles remain to a deal. Private equity firms have circled the company for more than two years and have tried without success so far to figure out ways to structure a deal. Moreover, Ottawa reviews any big takeover of a Canadian company for competitive and national security reasons. Government officials have often said they want BlackBerry to succeed as a Canadian company, but concede they do not know how things will play out.

REUTERS/Chris Ratcliffe/poolSample polymer five and ten GB pound banknotes are displayed at the Bank of England in London September 10, 2013. The Bank of England is moving closer to ditching paper pounds and switching to plastic banknotes instead. The central bank said on Tuesday it would ask the public its opinion before taking a decision in December on whether to adopt polymer pounds which also would be smaller than current notes.The Bank of England is taking its new plastic Â£5 and Â£10 notes on a nation-wide roadshow â€“ what will the public make of them? "Oh yes, I like them. TheyÂ are so much more hygienic,â€ says Elizabeth Dillon, stroking something that looks very much like a Â£10 note. â€œItÂ feels lovely and clean.â€ The 77-year-old is one of the very first members of the public to get her hands on the Bank of Englandâ€™s prototype banknotes, which look nearly identical to the existing ones but are made of plastic. The Old Lady of Threadneedle Street has gone on a roadshow. Yesterday marked the first day of her two-month national tour, when Bank officials set up a little stall in the Westgate shopping centre in Oxford. Outside Primark and (very appropriately) Poundland, officials were canvassing peopleâ€™s opinion of these notes, which â€“ if the public gives them the thumbs up â€“ will be introduced in 2016. Is the hygiene of banknotes a genuine worry, I ask Mrs Dillon. â€œYes!â€ she insists. â€œYou donâ€™t know where they have been.â€ She is one of many members of the public, especially pensioners, immediately won over by the â€œcleanlinessâ€ of the notes. Ann Walsh, in her sixties, is lovingly fingering one of the fresh, plastic notes. â€œI tell you why I am a fan,â€ she says, fishing out her husbandâ€™s wallet and pulling out an old tenner. â€œThis is tired, dirty and unpleasant.â€ Her husband is in firm agreement. â€œFor 15 years I was treasurer of our village church; a lot of tatty notes have passed through my hands. These ones feel nice and smooth.â€ Many passersâ€‘by were surprised that the notes â€“ launched with much fanfare this week â€“ were not stiff. They have been called plastic, but this suggests something rigid. The material is technically polymer, a thin, transparent and flexible film made of polypropylene on to which layers of ink are printed. The prototype notes have a distinctive, shine to them â€“ a matt gloss similar to that which is used on many hardback book dustjackets. Some shoppers described them as â€œsilkyâ€, others as â€œnot realâ€. To my fingers, they do not feel cheap. But many are taken aback by the sensation of touching them. â€œOoh, thatâ€™s really weird,â€ says Shannon Page, a young mother. â€œThey feel like theyâ€™d just slip out of your pocket.â€ There is a crispness to them, but they lack that distinctive tactility that allows you to run your fingers across the weft and warp of, say, a Â£20 note. With the new ones, your fingers simply glide across. Brenda Kulesza, a retiree, is one of the very few people I meet who is strongly opposed to the plastic notes. â€œI just prefer the touch and feel of paper. I paint and draw and sew â€“ I like natural materials. This new one has a synthetic feel. I donâ€™t like it.â€ The plastic notes â€“ contrary to some alarmist reports â€“ do fold into a wallet. But they do not fold completely flat. They â€œbounceâ€ back into shape, which Mr Walsh says would help church wardens trying fish out donations folded into those tiny gift-aid envelopes. The Bank â€“ whose new governor, Mark Carney, introduced polymer notes to Canada last year â€“ promises it will listen to all views before it makes a decision. But Victoria Cleland, the director of notes at the Bank, makes it clear that she would prefer to join the ranks of Australia, Mexico, New Zealand and Singapore, all of which have plastic notes. There are a number of reasons why the Bank thinks change is necessary. For starters, it is more difficult to forge. With polymer you can incorporate many more security features, including a clear window into the note, instead of a watermark. Cleland says: â€œWindows are difficult to counterfeit. The forger has to essentially cut a hole in the paper. Also â€“ unlike a watermark â€“ they are big and clear. People donâ€™t need to hold up notes to the light to see it.â€ The other benefit is that they are more durable and need to be replaced less frequently. Last year the bank produced 1.3 billion new notes and there are currently 2.99 billion notes in circulation. A fiver barely lasts a year before it needs to be shredded into tiny particles in a secret warehouse in Essex and turned into compost. The new notes are not biodegradable, although in Australia they are turned into plastic plant pots or furniture after they have come to the end of their life. Though the plastic notes are more expensive to produce, onÂ average they will last at least 2.5Â times longer than paper ones, so the Bank estimates it will save Â£100Â million over 10Â years. Intriguingly, one of the main benefits touted when they were unveiled this week was that they could survive being put through the washing machine. The Bank actually published detailed figures as to how many times members of the public ask for notes to be replaced because of damage. Last year, 1,189 requests were received because of damage by fire, 5,740 because they were â€œchewed/eatenâ€ and 2,082 because they had been washed â€“ not enough, one would think, to change the 320â€‘year-old tradition of printing on the material still used, which is a combination of recycled linen, rags andÂ paper. Of course, if members of the public deeply care about the tattiness of their fivers they could visit the City, go to the counter in the imposing Sir John Soane-designed bank hall and ask for their dirty or out-of-date notes to be swapped for fresh ones. â€œAbsolutely,â€ says Cleland. â€œBut donâ€™t encourage people to do it. Please.â€ She is worried about long queues stretching down the road. After the first few hours in the shopping centre it is clear that the public is definitely in favour of the plastic notes, convinced by the cost-savings, durability and cleanliness of polymer. But then I ask one fan, Tracey Samways, 48, what she thinks about the Bank of Englandâ€™s other plan, to shrink the new notes by 15 per cent. â€œThatâ€™s terrible. What a bad idea. I really like the current size.â€ One of the officials explains that Britain has some of the biggest bank notes in the world, even after they were shrunk in 1990. â€œWell, yes,â€ says Mrs Samways, a full-time carer. â€œI donâ€™t want to have notes the same size as everyone else.â€ Indeed one of the many glories of sterling is the generosity of scale of its banknotes. Yes, we no longer have to unfold a white five pound note the size of a handkerchief from our pocket, but there is a heft to even a tenner â€“ especially when compared with the flimsiness of a euro or the meanness of a dollar. Cleland tries to justify the decision: â€œA lot of people are beginning to think they are a bit big. We have heard from focus groups and people say 'my husband brought me back a beautiful wallet from New York, and my notes donâ€™t fit into itâ€™.â€ It is true that many of the Oxford shoppers say they do not like how their notes sometimes stick out of their purses. But the fact that leather goods manufacturers of the world are making smaller products seems a risible reason to shrink the size of our currency. â€œWe are trying to make the notes easier to handle,â€ says Cleland. The public are not being asked to give their views on this aspect. The decision has already been made. Ros Altmann, a pensions expert and former government adviser, is often a harsh critic of the Bank, but says: â€œWe will have to trust that they know what they are doing. But one thing is of comfort â€“ at least they are continuing to print banknotes.â€ Many high street banks and retailers would love it if we abandoned notes and coins, and used debit cards or, better still, contactless swipe cards. It would save them a fortune in cash-handling charges. But reassuringly, cash is more popular than ever and makes up 4.12 per cent of GDP, up from the 3 per cent a decade ago. With super low interest rates, many people no longer bother to keep cash in the bank. And others, hit by the recession, find it easier to budget using cash, rather than cards. â€œWe are still seeing a demand for cash. And that is pretty common across the industrialised world,â€ says Cleland. The folding stuff is here to stay. Even if it wonâ€™t fold quite so easily in the future.
