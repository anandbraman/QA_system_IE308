Good morning! Here’s what’s happening this Wednesday morning… 1. Australian mining giants are gunning for Chinese competitors. The power that the mining investment boom has created for the big Australian companies in the global market is starting to become clear: as demand has slowed out of China, BHP and Rio Tinto have continued to ratched up supply regardless, and according to one analyst it’s a play aimed at putting Chinese suppliers with lower-grade ore out of the market. 2. The S&amp;P500 closed above 2000 for the first time, finishing at a palindromic 2000.02 for the session, up a tiny 0.1% in a flat overnight US session. Asia had a poor day yesterday with the Nikkei down 0.6%, the Hang Seng off 0.4% and Shanghai having a big 1% fall. ASX futures are pointing to a slight rise at the open; one thing to look out for is a mini short squeeze on the miners because of the swings in the iron ore price lately. 3. Why was Tony Abbott late yesterday? Fairfax Media reports this morning the prime minister told fed-up MPs, who had to wait on his delayed arrival to a partyroom meeting yesterday in Canberra, that he had to attend a cancer centre function in Melbourne that morning to justify a taxpayer-funded trip which involved a private “fundraising” function the night before. 4. Qantas reports its results tomorrow and the festival of free advice is underway for the company that everyone in the country feels like they own. The latest: it needs to cut another 2000 jobs and cut back on its international operations to turn its fortunes around. Analysts are expecting an underlying pre-tax loss of $750 million. It’s worth noting that since the horror show of the market selling down Qantas as Alan Joyce briefed the media on the restructure plans earlier this year, the share price is up around 30%. 5. The US posted a stunning 22.6% rise in durable goods orders, thanks to a huge rise in aircraft orders for Boeing. There’s plenty of debate over the details when you remove the airline spike, but it’s good news for a big industrial sector of the recovering American economy. 6. Apple is making a huge new iPad that will go on sale next year. The collapse in iPad sales growth has been one of the big squeezes on the Cupertino giant recently. Bloomberg reports the new device will have a 12.9-inch screen compared to the current iPad Air’s 9.7-inch display and the 7.85 inch on the iPad Mini. That size makes it much more of an industrial working tablet compared to the current iPad, which falls between two stools for many people: too small for many work functions and just a tiny bit too big to lug around everywhere. 7. And a payments platform is all but confirmed now. Apple’s latest patent applicationdescribes a system capable of handling payments via NFC, the cloud, and QR codes. It has been described as an “omni-wallet” system. And for an idea of Apple’s starting point in terms of registered credit cards on its platforms, take a look at this chart: 8. Scotland could be invaded by Russia. Something to think about for Scots when they go to the independence poll in three weeks: a vote for a free Scotland means an unguarded coastline. At least, until they build some submarines. There’s no real reason why Russia would be interested, but it has a history of military “adventurism” and actually does have a habit of venturing into Scottish waters a couple of times a year. 9. Australian ingenuity solving the problem of hard butter. There’s a project going nuts on Kickstarter that solves a problem: how to spread butter from the fridge. This adaptation of a table knife by Australia’s DM Solutions fixes it. Here it is in action: Google uses a “toothbrush test” when running the ruler over companies: would you use it twice a day, every day? Tick. 10. Roman Abramovich’s 19-year-old daughter Sofia is pretty well-grounded for the offspring of a multibillionaire. Her Instagram account is in stark contrast to those of the Rich Kids of Instagram’s champagne-soaked indulgence shots. OK, there’s the usual flood of selfies and equestrian shots, but the best pics from Sofia are those of her life in the comparatively modest family home, and a great collection of Throwback Thursday moment with her and her dad. It’s nice to see. Bonus item: Stocks in ISIS are surging. There really is an ISIS pharmaceuticals, and its share price is up 43% in the last three months on not a huge amount of news. In the overnight session its share price was up 10%, almost inexplicably. Biotechs have been doing generally well on the markets, it’s worth noting; but also the headlines out of the Middle East might have been calling attention to the company, and investors like it. Have a cracking day. I’m on Twitter: @colgo Follow Business Insider Australia on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn This article originally appeared at Business Insider Australia.  Copyright 2014.

REUTERS/Rick Wilking Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren BuffettNEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett may be most famous for the billions of dollars he has made from investing but he is also well known as a cheerleader for the United States. The Oracle of Omaha routinely exhorts investors to put their money in America, "the mother lode of opportunity," as he wrote in his annual letter this year. So Buffett's participation in fast-food chain Burger King Worldwide Inc's purchase of coffee and doughnut chain Tim Hortons Inc – complete with relocation of Burger King's domicile to Canada – might at first blush raise questions about his patriotism. Investors and tax experts say Miami-based Burger King's move to Canada through a so-called tax inversion will help curb its U.S. tax bill. Similar recent moves by other U.S. companies - mainly through the purchase of European companies - have drawn the ire of President Barack Obama, who suggested they are corporate deserters lacking economic patriotism. But analysts and investors say that the Burger King deal underlines the market savvy that's helped him build his fortune more than prompting questions about his commitment to the U.S. "When Warren Buffett advocates investing in America, as I understand it, that's because that's where the opportunities largely lie," said Meyer Shields, managing director at investment bank Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc. "Investing in America is actually the outcome of his analysis instead of the beginning assumption." Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has committed $3 billion of preferred equity for 3G Capital, which controls Burger King, to buy Tim Hortons in a deal worth almost $12 billion. That should give him a juicy return and a stake in any increase in value of the combined entity. Berkshire, a sprawling conglomerate with more than 80 companies and a wide-ranging stock portfolio, will have no role in operating the new entity. Berkshire Hathaway and Buffett did not return calls requesting comment. Buffett tried to explain the reasons for the move to Canada in comments to the Financial Times. "Tim Hortons earns more money than Burger King does," he told the paper. "I just don't know how the Canadians would feel about Tim Hortons moving to Florida. The main thing here is to make the Canadians happy."  NOT A DIME MORE Buffett, the world's third richest person, has been clear in the past on the question of corporate tax rates. "Anybody who thinks corporate taxes are too high should look at a chart of corporate taxes as a percentage of GDP since World War II," Buffett said at the annual Berkshire Hathaway stockholders' meeting in Nebraska in May this year in reference to a big drop in that level. He has also advocated higher tax rates for the ultra rich, noting that his longtime secretary, Debbie Bosanek, pays a higher tax rate than he does. But for all that Buffett has defended the idea that corporations in the U.S. see enviable profits, he's also been clear that it's not his job to write any more checks to the government than necessary. "I will not pay a dime more of individual taxes than I owe, and I won't pay a dime more of corporate taxes than we owe," he told Fortune magazine this year. Berkshire's stock portfolio is stuffed full of iconic American companies, such as Coca Cola and IBM. And the investment company owns plenty of well-known names, as well, including Dairy Queen and insurer Geico. But in the criteria he's talked about over the years for why he buys a company, such as the simplicity of a business, strong management and earnings power, a U.S. headquarters does not factor. Simply put, said Bill Smead, chief investment officer of Smead Capital Management and a Berkshire investor, "Buffett is a capitalist first and a patriot second."   (Reporting by Luciana Lopez; Edited by Martin Howell) FREE AppDownload
AP Images(Reuters) - As hopes for a last-minute buyer dim, Atlantic City's Revel casino has laid out its closure plans, from disposing of opened bottles of alcohol to cashing unredeemed poker chips. The plans detailed in court documents mark the end of a $2.4 billion hotel-casino that was hailed by state leaders including Governor Chris Christie as a model for reviving the New Jersey seaside city when it opened in 2012. The plan will go into effect on Sunday, as the sleek casino's 14 restaurants and five pool areas close, allowing for the removal of perishable goods. Unopened bottles of alcohol will be packaged, recorded for inventory and stored, until approval is given to sell them, according to a Monday filing with U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Camden, New Jersey. The 47-story hotel, restaurant and casino complex, with a striking design meant to evoke the rolling surf of the Atlantic Ocean, never caught on with gamblers. It opened just as neighboring Pennsylvania and Delaware embraced casinos, and filed for bankruptcy for the first time in 2013. Revel filed its current bankruptcy in June, with plans for a auction with what it hoped would be several bidders to buy the property. But earlier this month, Revel said no parties had submitted a qualifying bid, which required a pledge to operate the casino as a going concern. From the start, Revel was criticized for serious missteps such as a non-smoking policy and a layout that put the gaming floor at the periphery of the complex, which is located at northern end of the city's boardwalk. "The debtors remain hopeful that a qualified bid will emerge from continued negotiations with potential bidders," Revel's lawyer Michael Viscount of Fox Rothschild in Atlantic City, wrote in the filing. "At this time, however, the debtors are unable to set a definitive timeframe for the sale process." The filing noted that Wells Fargo, which provided Revel's bankruptcy loan to finance operations during its Chapter 11, expressed a willingness to extend its loan beyond the current maturity of Oct. 31. At 6 a.m. on Sept. 2, the doors will close for good and Revel AC Inc will surrender its gaming license. Revel is one of four Atlantic City casinos that have closed or announced plans to close this year. After the casino closes, it plans to honor outstanding slot vouchers and unredeemed poker chips until Sept. 15. Any holders who do not redeem their winnings by then will become general unsecured creditors, according to the filing. Winnings that had been deposited with the casino for safekeeping that are not claimed by Sept. 15 will be turned over to the state of New Jersey as unclaimed property, according to the filing.

Thomson ReutersHandout photo of a 99-pack of "Peacemaker" aleAUSTIN Texas (Reuters) - Beer packaging has just gotten a lot bigger in Texas, where a small brewery is launching a 99-pack of its "Peacemaker" ale. The 7-foot-long (2.13-meter-long) pack consists of three rows of 33 cans that tip the scales at 82 pounds (37 kg) and will likely have a retail price of about $99. Austin Beerworks plans to put its first 99-pack on store shelves this week. "We made it at first as a joke," said Michael Graham, co-founder of the Austin-based craft brewery. But it seems a lot of people are taking it seriously. Despite not being an easy fit for store shelves, interest has been high among retailers for the 99-packs, which are too big for home refrigerators but designed so that once a pack is opened, the beer can be covered in ice. The company plans to ship about 20 of the massive packs a week. "You might want to share this with about 33 of your friends," Graham said.   (Editing by Eric Walsh) FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersWorkers sit next to bags containing sugar at the San Francisco Ameca sugar factory in the town of AmecaMEXICO CITY/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is set to slap import duties as high as 17 percent on Mexican sugar in a victory for the powerful U.S. sugar industry but a blow to U.S. candy and soft drink makers who face paying more for the sweetener. Mexican producers urged a deal to end the spat while the government hinted at retaliation, highlighting the potential for Tuesday's Department of Commerce ruling to increase tensions in a months-long trade dispute over claims cheap subsidized sugar is flooding the heavily protected U.S. market. The duties mean companies like sweets and food makers Hershey Co, Mondelez International Inc, General Mills Inc and drinks makers such as Coca Cola Co will have to pay up to 5 cents per pound extra for imported Mexican sugar, based on current prices. The United States is a net importer of sugar and Mexico is one of its largest suppliers. Mexican imports are estimated at 2.1 million short tons for the 2013/14 crop year that runs through Sept. 30. The preliminary decision could still be overturned but is only the first stage of a case which could lead to a further round of levies. It underscores the influence that U.S. cane and beet growers, a relatively small but politically engaged sector in U.S. farming, have over domestic farm and trade policy. Out of a total 2.2 million U.S. farms, less than 4,700 grow cane and beet, according to data from the Washington-based Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. But the sector accounts for a third of the crop industries' campaign donations and 40 percent of crop industries' lobbying expenditures, it said. Tuesday's decision is a victory for the American Sugar Alliance (ASA), which represents U.S. sugar farmers and processors and has pushed for an end to free trade with Mexico since sweetener was included in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) six years ago. The ASA said on Tuesday it expects final countervailing duties would be even higher than the preliminary decision. "The finding validates our claim that the flood of Mexican sugar, which is harming America’s sugar producers and workers, is subsidized by the Mexican government," a spokesman said. Still, one U.S. sugar importer described the duties as "devastating", and warned that U.S. prices would likely rise in line with the new tariff. U.S. prices are already above the global market because of a government subsidy program that sets minimum prices. Under the ruling, sugar from state-owned Mexican mills - which account for a fifth of production - will attract duties of 17.01 percent, compared to 2.99 percent for private sector Grupo Azucarero Mexico producers and 14.87 percent for all other producers. Mexico sugar chamber president Juan Cortina said the industry was prepared to cap exports in exchange for suspending duties, as long as any deal allowed minimum exports of 1 million tonnes per cycle. The chamber believed a deal could be reached before the U.S. rules on the anti-dumping section of the case in October - which could lead to more duties. U.S. producers claim Mexican sugar is sold at 45 percent or more below fair value. The U.S. International Trade Commission is also conducting a parallel investigation into whether the imports injure local growers. Its final verdict is due in February. CONSUMERS PAY THE PRICE U.S. Agriculture Secretary Thomas Vilsack has said he would encourage a settlement, but U.S. lawmakers, food manufacturers and commercial users of sugar have warned a deal would inflate food prices and threaten U.S. food manufacturers. "The likely result is that the growers, particularly in the United States, will make more money, and the consumers will pick up the tab," said National Foreign Trade Council president Bill Reinsch. The Sweetener Users Association said Mexico had become a scapegoat for the failings of the U.S. sugar program and critics argue the case could prompt retaliation against U.S. high-fructose corn syrup. Mexico's Economy Ministry said the decision was a setback in trade relations and that Mexico will defend its rights and exhaust the legal options to protect its interests under NAFTA and the World Trade Organization. Concerns about tightening supplies in the United States have pushed domestic prices up 18 percent since the case was filed in March. Second-month U.S. domestic raw sugar futures traded in New York jumped to a two-week high of 26.75 cents a lb in thin trade after the news but pared the gains by the close. In the meantime, traders braced for volatile and uncertain trading conditions ahead of the government's decision on antidumping duties on Oct. 24. "The dumping duty is the big one. This (Tuesday's ruling) should encourage Mexico to try to get a deal, and strengthen the conviction of the (U.S. sugar industry)," said Frank Jenkins, president of Connecticut brokerage JSG Commodities.   (Additional reporting by Chris Prentice and Josephine Mason in New York and David Alire Garcia in Mexico City; Editing by Marguerita Choy, Andrea Ricci, Tom Brown and Andrew Hay) FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Andrew WinningGallery workers sit next to "Teoria" by Eduardo Basualdo at the Frame Gallery's stand at the Frieze Art Fair in central London, October 16, 2013.As my colleague Rick Rieder noted in a post earlier this week, the Federal Reserve (Fed)’s recently released minutes and Jackson Hole Symposium comments suggest that a period of rate normalization is approaching. In other words, while rates should remain relatively low over the long term and the rate normalization process will be a slow one, the Fed is likely to begin raising rates in the first half of 2015, and the first rate hike could come as early as March, earlier than many market watchers expect. Rick covered a bit about what this means for the markets and the economy, but you may still be wondering how to position your portfolio for normalizing rates. In my last weekly commentary, “Rethink ‘Safe Havens’ as Rates Ready to Rise,” I advocate caution toward these two asset classes. Treasury bonds with two- to five-year maturities. While longer-term interest rates have remained stable, the prospect for an early Fed tightening is exerting downward pressure on the prices of shorter-maturity Treasury bonds — particularly those with two- to five-year maturities — and pushing yields higher. I continue to advocate caution toward these maturities, as I expect they will prove the most vulnerable if the Fed does in fact accelerate the timetable of the first rate hike. Commodities like gold. In addition to short-maturity bonds, another asset class that is proving vulnerable to rising rates is commodities. The prospect for tighter monetary conditions is driving the dollar higher and putting downward pressure on many commodities. Stronger economic data and the prospect for tighter monetary conditions recently pushed the dollar to its highest level since last September. Along with a stronger dollar, the potential for higher real (i.e., inflation-adjusted) rates and a declining geopolitical risk premium have pushed the gold price down 5% from its July high. Other commodities have suffered as well: Most agricultural commodities are down between 5% and 10% year-to-date, and oil prices have slid on less angst over Iraq and the Middle East. Among these various commodities, I remain particularly cautious of precious metals given their sensitivity to higher real rates. As for which asset classes I like, I continue to prefer stocks over the “traditional “safe-haven” assets I mention above. Why? Traditional “safe haven” assets such as short- to intermediate-duration U.S. Treasuries and gold may, in fact, be more vulnerable than stocks in the near term as a period of interest rate normalization approaches. Although not cheap, stocks have the tailwinds of still-low rates and improving economic conditions at their back. The stock market continues to wrestle with a series of counterforces, and for now, low rates and an improving U.S. economy are trumping full valuations and lingering geopolitical risks, allowing stocks to move higher.

Thomson ReutersA portrait of the Snapchat logo in VenturaSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byer has agreed to invest in fast-growing messaging startup Snapchat at a valuation close to $10 billion, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday, citing people with knowledge of the matter. The venture-capital firm had committed to invest up to $20 million in Snapchat in May, the Journal cited one of the people as saying, without elaborating. At least one other strategic investor has committed to joining the latest round of funding, the Journal cited two of the people as saying. If the deal goes through, Snapchat would join a select club of tech startups with valuations of $10 billion or more, including car-ride service Uber and rooms-to-let startup AirBnB. Snapchat, a so-called ephemeral messaging service popular with teenagers, turned down a $3 billion acquisition offer from Facebook Inc last year, a source close to the matter told Reuters. It now lets users send photo-messages that vanish within seconds, but is expected to soon begin offering advertising or branch out into additional services. Snapchat is similar to a new crop of popular mobile messaging apps that compete with established Internet services such as Twitter Inc's and Facebook. Though few of them have established business models, their rapid user growth and perceptions of advertising potential have aroused intense investor interest over the past year or so. Neither Snapchat nor Kleiner were immediately available for comment.  (Reporting by San Francisco newsroom; Editing by Sonya Hepinstall) FREE AppDownload

Out Of 12,052 Ratings On S&amp;P Stocks, Just 6% Are 'Sells' (Bespoke Investment) Bespoke Investment observes there are now 12,052 analyst ratings on S&amp;P 500 stocks, which equates to 24 ratings per stock. Of those, just 6% are rated "sell." Utilities have the fewest "buy" ratings while energy companies have the most.  NYSE Margin Debt Falls (Doug Short) NYSE margin debt, or the amount of money that's been borrowed to buy stocks , fell 0.8% in August. With the caveat that the data is a month old, Short says it's something to keep an eye on because it has correlated with market tops. "...[We] see that the troughs in the monthly net credit balance preceded peaks in the monthly S&amp;P 500 closes by six months in 2000 and four months in 2007. The most recent S&amp;P 500 correction greater than 10% was the 19.39% selloff in 2011 from April 29th to October 3rd. Investor Credit hit a negative extreme in March 2011. There are too few peak/trough episodes in this overlay series to take the latest credit-balance data as a leading indicator of a major selloff in U.S. equities. But we'll definitely want to keep an eye on this metric in the months ahead." Doug Short Recessions Don't Matter All That Much For Investors (GaveKal) Recessions are obviously bad. But it turns out that investors still average 2% returns, with a median return of 3%. "Market performance during different expansions pre-WWII were more similar and had less skewness as indicated by their much closer average and mean returns compared to the market returns post-WW2," the GaveKal team writes. "The max return is higher after WWII and the median return is slightly lower. Recessions were harsher to investors prior to WWII. The median market return during a recession was -9% before 1946 while the median market return since is actually positive (3%). Max drawdown highlights this as well as the median max drawdown was 11% deeper before WWII (26% vs 15%)." Bernanke: Lehman Was Worse Than The Great Depression (WSJ) WSJ's Pedro da Costa has pulled a fairly stunning quote out of an AIG bailout lawsuit: Bernanke believed the 2008 financial crisis was worse than the Great Depression. “September and October of 2008 was the worst financial crisis in global history, including the Great Depression,” the former Fed chair said.

Thomson ReutersAllergan CEO Pyott speaks during an interview in New York(Reuters) - Allergan Inc said on Tuesday that it has scheduled a special shareholders meeting for Dec. 18, when activist investor Bill Ackman, who supports a hostile bid for the company by Valeant Pharmaceuticals Inc, will attempt to oust most of its board. Although Allergan set a date for the meeting, it said in a Delaware court filing that it will review the validity of the shareholder requests for the meeting on Sept. 4. California-based Allergan, the maker of Botox anti-wrinkle skin injections, is trying to fend off a $49 billion hostile takeover by Canada's Valeant. Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management, Allergan's biggest shareholder, hopes to see a revamped Allergan board that would be willing to negotiate with Valeant. Ackman said on Friday that investors holding 31 percent of Allergan shares had asked for the meeting. Pershing Square said it also filed a lawsuit in Delaware to require Allergan to schedule the meeting, anticipating that the company would likely fight doing so. At least 25 percent of shareholder support is necessary under Allergan's bylaws to call the meeting.  (Reporting by Rod Nickel in Winnipeg, Manitoba; Editing by Leslie Adler) FREE AppDownload
AP ImagesThe Ibis T5000(TM) Biosensor SystemISIS, or the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, has gotten lots of attention for the terror it has brought to the Middle East. Unfortunately, this has attracted the wrong kind of attention to companies that coincidentally share the same name as the extremist group. Take ISIS Pharmaceuticals. This $4.3 billion biotech firm surged 10% today, and it's up 43% in the last three months. According to Nasdaq, the stock price crossed above its 200-day moving average for the first time since early spring. ISIS Pharma has nothing to do with the terrorist group. According to their website, ISIS Pharma develops new drugs to "treat patients who have significant unmet medical needs." There's no obvious direct explanation for ISIS Pharma's rally today. However, it's worth noting that biotechnology stocks in general have been doing pretty well this year. The iShares NASDAQ Biotechnology Index ETF (IBB) is up a whopping 21% since the beginning of the year. And in recent months we've heard biotech firms like Kite, Achillion, Intercept, Tekmira, and Gilead all announce good news regarding the innovative drugs that they're developing or marketing. IBB climbed 1.1% today. KITE surged 17%. Google FinanceISIS is having a great month.Shares of these publicly traded biotech firms tend to be very volatile, as their businesses often rely on the unlikely breakthroughs of a very narrow pipeline of drugs. "Lots of sophisticated investors purchase biotech companies that have no earnings and are regularly raising cash to stay in business," stock market expert Ed Yardeni said. "These investors do so knowing that the outcomes are binary: The companies they invest in will either find a cure for a disease or they won’t. Their new drugs will either be approved by the FDA or they won’t. They might be acquired for a huge premium or they might not, or might go out of business." Today's 10% move in ISIS Pharma appears to be about improving sentiment towards the company's drug pipeline. FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Darren WhitesideMalaysia Airlines ticket officeKUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - As bodies from downed Flight MH17 were brought home last week, a group of Malaysia Airlines flight attendants, in black mourning headscarves contrasting with their pink and turquoise uniforms, sobbed and clung to each other in grief. The 19,500 staff of Malaysia Airlines (MAS) now face a new ordeal - a quarter of them may lose their jobs at the unprofitable airline, hit by two jet disasters this year. Flight MH370 remains untraced since its disappearance en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing in March. Deep job losses, route cuts and a change of leadership are expected to feature in a restructuring plan being prepared by Malaysia's government for announcement as early as Thursday, when MAS also reports second-quarter results. Likely the last before being de-listed, the numbers are expected to show plunging ticket sales and heavy losses even before July's shooting down of MH17 over Ukraine. As state fund Khazanah Nasional [KHAZA.UL], the majority owner, prepares to take the company private and inject efficiency into the airline, it must tackle crumbling staff morale and win over the powerful main labor union if turnaround efforts are to succeed. "MAS is suffering from an image problem and a problem with the staff," said Nik Huslan, former chief pilot at MAS. "They have to find someone the staff can respect and rally behind." Even before the lost aircraft tragedies, airline insiders said staff discontent had been growing for years due to strategy U-turns, leadership changes and poor career prospects. One of the region's most prestigious and fastest-growing airlines in the 1990s, MAS has steadily fallen behind high-end rivals such as Singapore Airlines and been battered by the rise of Asia's budget carriers like AirAsia. The company hasn't made an annual profit since 2010. Facebook/Malaysia AirlinesMalaysia Airlines economy classThis year's twin disasters have caused new stresses. A total of 186 MAS flight crew quit between January and July, many of them due to family pressure not to fly after the crashes, MAS says. Over 5,000 MAS staff work as cabin crew or pilots and the airline says the resignation rate has now returned to normal. About a quarter of MAS staff are likely to lose their jobs under Khazanah's plan, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. The pill is likely to be sweetened with costly redundancy packages and offers of jobs at other state enterprises. UNION MUSCLE Malaysia Airlines executives told Reuters that the tragedies had served as a wake-up call to staff, and even to recalcitrant union bosses, that drastic change could no longer be avoided if the 42-year-old company is to survive. "There needs to be a change in the mindset, and people are coming around to that," said one senior executive. "People must realize that they may need to work differently – the crew may have to work longer shifts or they may have shorter layovers. The engineers may have to work a bit longer or clear aircraft faster." But such demands would also have to be leavened with incentives to encourage staff, or at least a convincing message that they will eventually see benefits, the main union has warned. "We want to see things in total, and what the long-term plan is," said Mohd Jabarullah Abdul Kadir, executive secretary of the Malaysia Airlines Employees Union (MASEU), which represents 13,000 of the carrier's staff. "If there are retrenchments, they cannot cut staff numbers without basis." REUTERS/Olivia HarrisGround crew work among Malaysia Airlines planes on the runway at Kuala Lumpur International AirportFor Prime Minister Najib Razak, who chairs Khazanah, the plan will be seen as the latest gauge of his credentials as a reformer in Southeast Asia's third-largest economy. State firms are used as one tool to reinforce affirmative action policies favoring majority ethnic Malays over other races and are heavily intertwined with Najib's long-ruling United Malays National Organisation (UMNO). The main union at MAS has close ties to UMNO - and has successfully resisted previous restructuring attempts. 'SAME CIRCUS, DIFFERENT CLOWNS' Crew who have worked at the airline recently complained about a lack of opportunities to progress in their careers. Cabin crew are typically offered five-year contracts, they said, after which they start from scratch with a new five-year deal. "There's always uncertainty for your career because of this arrangement," said one former crew member, who was with the airline for nearly three decades from the mid-1980s and recalls the "exciting" early days of the airline's rapid expansion. Huslan, the former chief pilot, blamed "poor talent management" for high attrition rates among pilots and engineers. "They leave for better prospects because they don't see it in MAS. This has been on the rise," he said. To reverse that, the most vital ingredient of the turnaround plan may be a new chief executive who can effectively communicate the new strategy, execute the plan, and win over doubters. REUTERS/Olivia HarrisA man and his daughter look at AirAsia planes at Kuala Lumpur International AirportThe sober demeanor of current chief executive Ahmad Jauhari Yahya, who relaxes by competing in triathlons, is a stark contrast to the brash showmanship of Malaysia's most famous airline boss, Tony Fernandes of budget carrier AirAsia. "Airlines are about image," said Huslan. "If you cannot carry an image, well that's the end of the story for you. You cannot have a humble and shy CEO." Others say previous changes in the carrier's management have failed to wipe out inefficiencies, while breeding skepticism among staff that new leadership can bring lasting improvements.  "Every time somebody new steps in there's a pretense of change," said the former MAS cabin crew member. "We have a famous saying among the staff: 'It's the same circus, with different clowns'."   (Writing by Stuart Grudgings; Editing by Kenneth Maxwell) FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/John GressClerks in the Euro Dollar pit at the Chicago Mercantile ExchangeWe're still hitting new records in the stock market. First, the scoreboard: And now, the top stories on Monday: 1. The S&amp;P 500 got as high as 2,005.04 before settling at 2,000.02 for the day. To be clear, the S&amp;P got above 2,000 on Monday before closing just below that level. According to S&amp;P, the S&amp;P 500 has now made 30 new record highs since the beginning of the year, and 66 of the original 500 companies remain in the index today. 2. Durable goods orders surged 22.6% in July due to an expected spike in aircraft orders. In July, Boeing reported orders for 324 planes, up from 109 in June. Nondefense capital goods order excluding aircraft — a proxy for business spending — fell by 0.5% in July; However, growth in that same measure for June was revised up to 5.4% from an earlier estimate for 1.4%. "On balance, the momentum in core orders in the second quarter bodes well for equipment and software spending in the second half of the year and core shipments remain in line with our outlook for modest rates of business investment," said Barclays' Michael Gapen. 3. The S&amp;P Case-Shiller home price index fell 0.2% month-over-month in June, which was worse than the 0.0% decline expected by economists. "“For the first time since February 2008, all cities showed lower annual rates than the previous month," noted S&amp;P's David Blitzer. "Other housing indicators — starts, existing home sales, and builders’ sentiment — are positive. Taken together, these point to a more normal housing sector." 4. The Conference Board's consumer confidence index unexpectedly jumped to 92.4 in August, the highest level since October 2007. "Consumer confidence increased for the fourth consecutive month as improving business conditions and robust job growth helped boost consumers’ spirits," said the Conference Board's Lynn Franco. "Looking ahead, consumers were marginally less optimistic about the short-term outlook compared to July, primarily due to concerns about their earnings. Overall, however, they remain quite positive about the short-term outlooks for the economy and labor market." 5. Burger King and Tim Hortons officially announced their plan to merge, sending the U.S. burger chain's tax domicile to Canada via a tax inversion. Tim Hortons shareholders will receive $65.50 in cash per share and 0.8025 of a share in the new parent company. All in, this makes each share of Tim Hortons worth about $89.32. Each share of Burger King will be converted into 0.99 of a share of the new company. 6. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway will be providing $3 billion in preferred equity financing. He'll be getting a 9% dividend on those securities. 7. Best Buy shares fell 6.8% after the company announced comparable store sales fell 2.7% in Q2. This was worse than the 2.2% decline expected. "Like other retailers and as reflected in this quarter’s performance, we continued to see a shift in consumer behavior: Consumers are increasingly researching and buying online," CEO Hubert Joly said. "As a result, traffic to our brick-and-mortar stores continued to decline, yet our in-store conversion and online traffic continued to increase." Indeed, online sales surged 22% during the period. 8. Orbitz Worldwide shares fell 4.6% after the online travel site announced some major airlines would no longer list their fares on the site. "American Airlines has withdrawn its fares from consumer websites powered by Orbitz, effective immediately," said management. "American Airlines Group has notified Orbitz it also will withdraw US Airways fares on Sept. 1, 2014."

Business InsiderOur rendering of what a giant iPad may look like. Apple is working on an even bigger version of the iPad that it plans to launch next year, Bloomberg reports. The new iPad will have a 12.9-inch screen, which is just a hair smaller than the screen on the biggest MacBook Air. Today's iPad Air has a 9.7-inch screen. The iPad Mini has a 7.85-inch screen. The big-screen iPad will launch in the first quarter of 2015, according to the report. There have been rumors throughout Apple's supply chain for months that the company was working on a larger version of the iPad. Some people have been calling it the iPad Pro. However, this report from Bloomberg is the most solid evidence we've had yet of such a device. Meanwhile, Apple's iPad business has been pretty sluggish. iPad sales growth has been declining. Last quarter, unit sales were down 9% on a year-over-year basis. This chart from Business Insider Intelligence will give you a good idea of how the iPad business is going for Apple: Business Insider Intelligence   One way Apple is trying to reinvigorate iPad sales is by selling the devices to large companies through its new partnership with IBM. IBM will use its salesforce to sell iPads to large enterprises. It'll also make enterprise apps for the tablets. Diversifying the iPad lineup with a larger model could help, too. Apple is marketing iPads as productivity tools, and, in some cases, replacements for traditional laptops. A bigger screen and perhaps some sort of keyboard accessory could be a way to help push that narrative even further. And, yes, that's very similar to what Microsoft is trying to do with its Surface Pro 3: Steve Kovach/Business Insider    FREE AppDownload
REUTERS / Philippe WojazerFrench President Francois Hollande and economy advisor Emmanuel Macron walk in the Elysee Palace in Paris, October 1, 2013.President Francois Hollande replaced his maverick leftist economy minister with a former Rothschild partner on Tuesday, in a reshuffle intended to reconcile his efforts to revive the stagnant French economy with deficit-cutting orthodoxy.  The shake-up is the latest episode in the wrangling across Europe about how much budgetary rigor the region's economies can bear as they recover from financial crises. For Hollande, who is revamping his government for a second time in two years, it could be his last chance to make a success of his presidency. Arnaud Montebourg, ejected from the key economy ministry post on Monday after his latest tirade against German-enforced "austerity" in the euro zone, was replaced by Emmanuel Macron. Macron, a 36-year-old former merchant banker, acted as Hollande's top economic adviser until June. He was widely known in French business circles as their "ear" at Hollande's presidential palace, otherwise largely packed with technocrats. The new cabinet makes its debut just a few weeks ahead of tough negotiations at home and with EU peers on a 2015 budget widely expected to break promises to Brussels over deficit cuts. Sources close to Hollande said the new cabinet, whose names were read out on the steps of his Elysee Palace, would carry out his plan of reconciling pro-business measures to boost growth - including 40 billion euros in corporate tax cuts - with promises to adhere to EU budget rules. "We need it to act in such a way as to ensure solidarity, respect and consistency," one source said of Hollande's bid to draw a line under two years of confused leadership that has seen his popularity ratings spiral to record lows. Hollande's former coalition partners, the left-wing Greens, will field no ministers in the new cabinet. Senior Green Jean-Vincent Place said "the conditions were not met" for them to have a role in government. Finance Minister Michel Sapin kept the role in which he has tried to reassure EU partners that France will finally mend its public finances despite repeatedly failing to bring its deficit below an EU-endorsed limit of three percent of output. Sapin was undermined by Montebourg's public questioning of the EU rules. "After the unacceptable comments from the ejected economy minister, this step was overdue," Germany's EU Commissioner Guenther Oettinger said earlier of the French reshuffle. "This move clearly shows that the right wing of the Socialist party is also able to speak louder," wrote ING's Julien Manceaux in a note to clients, calling the choice of Macron "a very good signal to France's European partners". Two other rebels, culture minister Aurelie Filippetti and education minister Benoit Hamon, were replaced by existing ministers solidly loyal to the increasingly centrist line that Hollande has set for his Socialist government since January. Valls handed in his government's resignation on Monday after Hollande judged that the outspoken Montebourg had gone too far by attacking his economic recovery plan and crucial euro zone partnerGermany's "obsession" with austerity. While Montebourg's appeals for fiscal loosening aimed at boosting growth have started to gain traction in some quarters outside France, others insist that trimming welfare systems and state spending are needed to make economies more competitive. At stake is the slender majority of Hollande's Socialists in the lower house of parliament, which is due to examine the budget bill and other reforms, including a liberalization of France's highly regulated services sector, in the coming weeks. Prime Minister Manuel Valls, speaking to France 2 after the new ministers were named, said he would call a vote of confidence in parliament for September or October. Such a vote is not mandatory, suggesting that Valls believes he would win the support of a majority of National Assembly deputies. But if around 40 leftist Socialist deputies feel under-represented by the new cabinet, they could abstain or oppose the forthcoming reforms. The danger for them is that, given the unpopularity of the ruling majority, they would be likely to lose their seats if a rebellion triggered new elections. Filippetti earlier played down speculation that the existing ministers would seek to lure away leftist deputies from the government camp and so undermine Hollande's fragile majority. "It's not our aim to provoke a government crisis. I will support the new government," the ex-culture minister told BFM-TV, saying she planned to focus her work on the depressed region of northeastern Francewhere she is a Socialist deputy. The European debate about how to re-start growth without undermining public finances is not just being heard in France. Austria's Finance Minister Michael Spindelegger resigned on Tuesday after drawing fire for his refusal to cut taxes unless they can be financed without new levies.   (Additional reporting by Ingrid Melander and Alexandria Sage in Paris,; Michelle Martin in Berlin and the Vienna bureau; editing by Gareth Jones, Larry King) FREE AppDownload
The Great Recession officially ended back in June 2009. We're now in the sixth year of the economic recovery and bull market. Are we overdue for another recession? "Recessions don’t happen because of a clock ticking," said Deutsche Bank's Torsten Slok. "Recessions happen because of imbalances in the economy or too tight monetary policy... In other words, with the fed funds rate well below neutral for many more years this expansion will likely also continue for many more years." Even the more hawkish economists don't expect the Federal Reserve to begin raising its benchmark fed funds rate until the middle of 2015. And that's just the starting point. So what does this mean for the U.S. economy? "One way to quantify how long time this expansion will continue is to look at the length of expansions and the level of the fed funds rate when expansions ended, i.e. just before recession began," said Slok. "On this measure the market still expects this expansion to continue for another five years or so." Currently, the Fed's target fed funds rate is in a range of 0.00 % to 0.25%. The Fed's primary dealers see that rate topping out at 3.75%. If we eyeball history, it could take around 60 months to get to that point. Deutsche Bank FREE AppDownload

Thomson ReutersA Charles Schwab Investment branch is seen in WashingtonBy Suzanne Barlyn (Reuters) - Charles Schwab Corp. has lost a $15 million arbitration case against Morgan Stanley, which it accused of improperly recruiting brokers from a Schwab San Francisco branch who left with confidential trade secrets. The decision by a Financial Industry Regulatory Authority arbitration panel in San Francisco, dated Monday, ends a dispute that began in 2012. Schwab alleged that Morgan Stanley had maliciously organized an "actionable raid" of its West Portal Avenue branch in San Francisco, according to the ruling. Schwab also accused Morgan Stanley of inducing Schwab brokers to breach their contracts. A Schwab spokesman was unable to immediately comment. A Morgan Stanley representative was not immediately available to comment. Claims involving the practice of so-called "raiding" are typically made when a firm loses 30 percent to 40 percent of the production - the amount brokers generate in revenue during a year - from a branch office to another firm in one swoop or over a short period of time, according to lawyers. The ruling did not identify the brokers who left Schwab. While the arbitrators denied Schwab's claims "in their entirety," they ordered Morgan Stanley to pay Schwab $72,000 in sanctions. The reasons for the sanctions are unclear. The three-member panel, as is customary, did not explain the reasons for the decision.

REUTERS/Robert GalbraithA man walks past a RadioShack retail store on Market Street in San Francisco, California(Reuters) - RadioShack Corp's second-largest shareholder, Standard General LP, is negotiating a rescue package with investors to help the consumer electronics retailer ward off bankruptcy, Bloomberg reported, citing people with knowledge of the matter. RadioShack shares were up 7.3 percent at 77 cents on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday. The hedge fund is also working with RadioShack's management to help the company avoid a Chapter 11 filing, Bloomberg reported. (http://bloom.bg/1lcdK8E) Standard General is seeking to strengthen RadioShack's cash flow by issuing debt or equity, Bloomberg said. The hedge fund has a 7 percent stake in RadioShack. The fund is also looking to refinance RadioShack's $250 million second-lien term loan, Bloomberg reported. The struggling retailer reported its ninth straight quarterly loss in June and is burning through cash as it struggles to sustain its turnaround efforts, which have so far failed to bear fruit. The company, whose sales have been falling since 2010, has been slashing prices to better compete with the likes of Best Buy Co Inc, Amazon.com Inc and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Standard General has also been helping American Apparel Inc's turnaround efforts. Its stake in the retailer recently rose to 44 percent after American Apparel founder Dov Charney gave his stake to the hedge fund as collateral for a loan. David Glazek, a partner at Standard General, declined to comment. RadioShack was not immediately available for comment. Up to Monday's close, the stock had fallen more than 72 percent this year.   (Reporting by Ramkumar Iyer in Bangalore; Editing by Simon Jennings) FREE AppDownload

Wikimedia CommonsThree Gorges Dam, ChinaChina’s 22,000-megawatt Three Gorges Dam, pictured on the cover of our latest Shareholder Report, is an undertaking that must be described in superlatives. Not only is it the world’s largest hydroelectric plant in terms of generating capacity, but it’s also one of history’s most expensive engineering feats, costing upwards of $25 billion. Many believe that the dam rivals the Great Wall of China in terms of ingenuity, scale and cultural significance. And like the Great Wall, Three Gorges Dam is not without its detractors, who point out some of the project’s unfortunate consequences, such as the displacement of an estimated 1.5 million Chinese citizens.   Consequences aside, China’s venture into hydro power, relatively inexpensive compared to other sources, has contributed to the nation’s reputation for having reasonably low energy prices. Furthermore, building a power plant of such gargantuan size calls for massive amounts of resources. Construction of Three Gorges Dam required 21 million cubic yards of concrete (a world record) and 463,000 tonnes of rolled steel (enough to make 63 Eiffel Towers). These projects have been welcomed by international manufacturers, exporters and investors alike. As you can see in the graphic below, China has more of the world’s largest hydroelectric plants than any other nation. That’s a lot of Eiffel Towers. Many readers might guess that the lone U.S. hydroelectric plant to make the list is Hoover Dam, but in fact it’s Washington State’s Grand Coulee Dam, which I discussed last month. Believe it or not, Hoover Dam no longer even makes it into the top 50 largest hydro plants in the world. Not only does China lead the rest of us in sheer hydro megawattage, but it also trumps the competition when it comes to new capacity additions. Of the 19 hydroelectric power stations currently under construction around the globe, eight are Chinese. Other countries that made significant additions to their hydropower market last year include Turkey, Brazil, Vietnam and Russia.

Thomson ReutersPeople play in a hall inside Alibaba's headquarters in HangzhouSAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are looking over portfolios to make room for Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holdings Inc's market debut next month - and that means some less attractive stocks that funds are holding might be shown the door. The initial public offering, which could top $16 billion to become the largest-ever IPO by a technology company, is expected as early as next month after Alibaba management kicks off a two-week investor road show after the Labor Day weekend. As investors take a hard look at their portfolios, it may trigger a veritable garage sale of names that are failing to impress Wall Street, including U.S. e-commerce rival Amazon.com Inc, fund managers said. "Any company that didn't meet expectations and give a rosy outlook is probably being considered as a sale candidate to make room for a name like this," said Jim O'Donnell, chief investment officer of Forward, which has $5 billion in assets under management. "There won't be wholesale turnovers of portfolios, but I imagine Amazon is being looked at," he added. Chinese rivals like Baidu Inc and Tencent Holdings Ltd also may be pressured as well if fund managers view Alibaba, which powers 80 percent of all online commerce in China, as a better path to tap into growth in the world’s second-largest economy. Next month's roadshow is likely to attract interest from a wide range of funds, including those focused on emerging markets and technology. Alibaba may garner a valuation of $200 billion or more when it goes public, analysts say, which would make it one of the 20 biggest companies listed in U.S. markets. "It is the 8,000-pound gorilla coming for the stock market," Michael Reynal, portfolio manager at San Francisco-based RS Investments, said of Alibaba. Just how investors act also depends on whether they gain a toehold in the highly anticipated IPO at all. One topic of debate is how investors who are boxed out of the IPO will play Yahoo Inc, which holds a 22.5 percent stake in Alibaba. The U.S. web portal has struggled to reinvent its core business, but has nonetheless seen its shares more than double in the last two years on the strength of its Alibaba ties. Some investors say Yahoo Inc could be sold to clear room for Alibaba. By some measures, the company carries a high valuation, with its enterprise value to sales ratio surpassing 90 percent of the U.S. stock market, according to Starmine, a Thomson Reuters company. On the flip side, investors boxed out of Alibaba's IPO could snap up Yahoo to capitalize on the Chinese company's growth. That argument could also help buoy shares in Softbank Corp, which has a 34 percent stake in Alibaba. "I bet a lot of people are playing Yahoo for Alibaba and once the IPO is gone, they may exit Yahoo completely," said Paul Meeks, senior analyst and portfolio manager of the $42 million Sextant Growth Fund at Saturna Capital, which has $4 billion assets under management. "A lot of people know they're not going to get IPO shares, so they hold Yahoo and Softbank," said Mark Yusko, who manages $4.5 billion as CIO of Morgan Creek Capital Management and has invested in Alibaba through private placements. "They want to capture the IPO pop."  Alibaba's debut comes at a time of growing dissatisfaction on Wall Street for Amazon's record of thin profits and heavy spending on developing television shows and hardware initiatives including aerial drones and smart phones. The expected boom in e-commerce in China may also drive some U.S.-based investors in Chinese search company Baidu toward Alibaba. Amazon shares have fallen about 17 percent so far this year, while shares in rival eBay Inc, which also could be sold in favor of the Chinese e-commerce company, has been flat as the tech-heavy Nasdaq has risen almost 9 percent. Amazon's operating margin over the last 12 months is about 0.8 percent while for eBay, margins are roughly 20 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. By contrast, Alibaba boasted a 47.5 percent operating margin in fiscal year 2014, ending in March, according to its IPO filing. Still, some analysts say Amazon is not easily replaced by Alibaba because of their relative geographic strengths. "Amazon has a stranglehold on the U.S. market just as Alibaba has a stranglehold on the Chinese market," said Daniel Kurnos, analyst at Benchmark Co. "It will be hard for one to penetrate the other." In 2013, Alibaba handled more online transactions than Amazon and eBay Inc and had 231 million active buyers, or the equivalent of 17 percent of China's population. By 2020, online retail sales in China are estimated to reach $420 billion to $650 billion, as much as the United States, Japanese, U.K., German and French markets combined, according to a recent analysis by McKinsey Global Institute.

Thomson ReutersPigeons are seen near graffiti in Detroit(Reuters) - Detroit and its major hold-out creditors were ordered on Tuesday into mediation, just a week before a key federal court hearing is to start in the city's historic bankruptcy case. The move followed a Monday hearing before U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Steven Rhodes on Detroit's objection to bond insurer Syncora Guarantee Inc's allegations of improper conduct and conflicts of interest in the case by court-appointed mediators. U.S. District Court Judge Gerald Rosen, the chief mediator in the case, set a Wednesday and possibly Thursday mediation session over $1.4 billion of certificates of participation (COPs) that Detroit sold in 2005 and 2006 to pay its pension liability. The session will include bond insurers that guaranteed payment on the COPs - Syncora [SYCRFS.UL] and Financial Guaranty Insurance Co [FGIC.UL]. The city, which defaulted on the debt in June 2013 and is seeking to void it altogether, is offering a recovery of only pennies on the dollar on the COPs in its plan to adjust $18 billion of debt. Meanwhile, the plan calls for much higher recoveries for city retirees resulting from the so-called grand bargain in which philanthropic foundations, the Detroit Institute of Arts and the state of Michigan would contribute money to ease pension cuts. In an Aug. 12 court filing, Syncora lashed out at mediators, including Rosen, who brokered the grand bargain, which is also aimed at protecting the museum's artwork from being sold to pay  Detroit creditors. "The plain truth is that the mediators in this case acted improperly by orchestrating a settlement that alienates the city’s most valuable assets for the sole benefit of one creditor group," Syncora's filing stated. Detroit's attorneys countered by accusing Syncora of making  "false and malicious allegations." While the city has won settlements with most of its biggest creditors, Syncora, which has a $400 million exposure mainly from insuring the COPs and related interest-rate swaps, has emerged as Detroit's No. 1 opponent in the case. The bond insurer has objected to almost every twist and turn in the complicated case. Syncora and FGIC filed motions last week to bar certain evidence and witnesses from the key confirmation hearing on Detroit's plan to adjust its debt and exit the biggest-ever municipal bankruptcy. That hearing to determine if the plan is fair and feasible is scheduled to begin Sept. 2. Syncora has also criticized the speed of the bankruptcy, filed in July 2013, and asked the court to send the city "back to the drawing board."

LinkedInA Wall Street investor relations person has been charged with insider trading for allegedly buying and selling stocks from company press releases prepared for his firm's clients, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement. Michael A. Lucarelli, the director of market intelligence at Lippert Heilshorn &amp; Associates, was arrested and charged with 13 counts of insider trading on Tuesday. His alleged scheme netted him at least $538,215.32 in ill-gotten gains, the release said. "As alleged, and despite the well-known parade of convicted insider trading perpetrators over the past several years, Michael Lucarelli was not deterred and violated both his company’s policies and his responsibility to its clients by trading on material nonpublic information for his personal financial gain. For the over $500,000 he earned from his illicit trades he is charged with 13 counts of securities fraud," Bharara said in a statement. According to the complaint, Lucarelli would allegedly take positions in stocks mentioned in press release drafts being prepared for his firm's clients. Right after the release was made public, he would exit the position profiting on the stock's price movement.  Bharara's office said that the FBI got a search warrant this summer and searched Lucarelli's office without his knowing. The FBI found a locked briefcase that contained draft press release of TREX's quarterly financial results. The FBI discovered that he had been purchasing shares of TREX between July 25 and Aug. 1. He was able to net $90,000 on that particular stock, the release said. Lucarelli allegedly traded in 13 different securities from August 2013 until August 2014 using non-public info from press releases. Bharara's office said the FBI discovered "numerous additional trades" and that the investigation was still ongoing.  If convicted, Lucarelli faces a maximum of 20 years in prison for each of the 13 counts and a maximum fine of $5 million per count.  FREE AppDownload
Jon Pack and Gary HustwitThe Olympic ski jumps from the 1984 Sarajevo Winter Olympics are now used for a different purpose entirely.Since the inception of the modern Olympics, there have been 49 winter and summer games held in 41 different cities around the globe. Some were great successes. Others, not so much. Researchers have known for years that cities that host large sporting events like the Olympics generally spend more money and make less than anticipated. And investing in an Olympic Games won't necessarily lead to long-term economic growth or improved infrastructure. Photographers and artists Jon Pack and Gary Hustwit set out to document what exactly happens when the games are over, and discovered varying answers. Pack and Hustwit explored and photographed relics and remains of once-new Olympic features in 13 cities. Their photos, collected in a new book entitled "The Olympic City," show the varied remnants of Olympic Games gone by.  "We're interested in the idea of government-approved spending — and these are huge amounts of money — to build massive structures, some of it temporary, all to host an event that will only last a couple of weeks ... Are [the people] benefiting from having been a part of the Olympics? Are the games a point of pride or regret?" Pack explains. Some places faired well, standing the test of time by adapting to new roles. Other structures fell to shambles after years of disuse. Both aspects, rebirth from ingenuity and death from poor planning, are documented in the series, which acts as a interesting behind-the-scenes look at the games we know and love.
Reuters/Jason ReedBerkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett.Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is providing $3 billion worth of preferred equity financing for Burger King's merger with Tim Hortons. Buffett's return on that cash will be 9%. On a conference call regarding the merger, Burger King CEO Daniel Schwartz said the preferred equity portion of the deal's financing, which is what Buffett is providing, would carry a 9% coupon. Preferred equity, also called preferred stock or just "preferreds," earns interest at a higher rate than bonds, but it also carries slightly more risk. If a company defaults, preferred equity investors are "junior" to all bondholders. Basically, they (most likely) get paid back second-to-last (after all bondholders, before common equity holders) if the company defaults. So if Burger King doesn't go out of business, it looks like a pretty good deal for Buffett. Except some of the optics of the deal aren't great.  Burger King's deal to acquire Tim Hortons is also a "tax inversion," or a deal in which a company based in the U.S. acquires a foreign company and moves its tax base.  The combined Burger King-Tim Hortons entity will be based in Canada, though both companies will maintain their physical headquarters in Miami and Oakville, Ontario, respectively. On Monday night, The Wall Street Journal broke the news that Buffett was involved in financing the deal, which produced some scorn and outrage on Twitter. Among other comments, this backlash was largely related to Buffett's past commentary about taxes and tax reform, which he partly outlined in a 2012 op-ed in The New York Times called "A Minimum Tax for the Wealthy."  The Financial Times interviewed Buffett on Tuesday, and Buffett told the paper that the deal was not about taxes, saying that the combined company would be based in Canada because of Tim Hortons' "strong roots" north of the border. Buffett has also worked with 3G Capital — which owns 70% of Burger King — in the past, working with the firm on Buffett's 2013 buyout of H.J. Heinz.  Tax inversions have been the most controversial corporate move this summer, with Congress, as well as the White House, pledging to pass legislation to stop the glut of companies moving their tax base overseas to enjoy lower tax rates abroad. AP Images But the Burger King-Tim Hortons deal doesn't really meet the same criteria. On Monday, BI's Brett LoGiurato outlined why legislation aimed at stopping tax inversions might not affect the Burger King deal.  And the move really won't save Burger King much money, anyway. Per Burger King's latest annual report with the SEC, the company's effective tax rate in 2013 was 27.5%, barely higher than the 26.8% effective tax rate Tim Hortons reported for the year.  On a call with analysts Tuesday morning, Burger King and Tim Hortons management emphasized repeatedly that the deal was not driven by taxes. And over at Bloomberg View, Matt Levine had a great, simple breakdown of why the "tax inversion" would not quite work for this deal. In short, Levine outlined that you can move your corporate headquarters overseas, then make and license a product from this foreign-based subsidiary to a U.S. subsidiary that sells it, which doesn't really work when you're selling burgers and coffee.  On Tuesday's call with analysts, Burger King and Tim Hortons also had some interesting commentary about potential "synergies" between the companies after the merger. Basically, analysts wanted to know if we would be seeing burgers in Tim Hortons coffee joints and Tim Hortons coffee in Burger King restaurants. The answer: "Absolutely not." Frankly, management from both companies on the call were focused on emphasizing that Tim Hortons would remain a Canada-based, Canadian-run company despite Burger King moving in.  Which makes some sense, considering the enormous popularity of Tim Hortons in Canada, where Tim Hortons accounts for 26% of all fast-food restaurants, with more than 3,600 outlets nationwide.  And as BI's Hayley Peterson has written, Burger King's 33-year-old CEO Josh Schwartz is an alumnus of 3G Capital, and during his time leading Burger King he has slashed costs at the company.  Schwartz also cut the number of restaurants owned by the company to just 52 of the company's 13,667 locations. This has significantly boosted profits at Burger King, which grew net income to $233.7 million in 2013 from $117.7 million the prior year.  And a quick look at Tim Hortons annual report shows a company that has a ton of sales but could be more profitable if some costs were reduced. Burger King and its management team most likely see the same. Google Finance FREE AppDownload
© AFP/File Kirill KudryavtsevA woman looking at dairy products in a supermarket in central Moscow on August 5, 2013.The Russian economy is nearing recession, officials said Tuesday, with punishing Western sanctions over the Ukraine conflict set to keep growth at ultra-low levels and drive up inflation.  "The economy is close to recession," said Oleg Zasov, the head of forecasting at the economy ministry, according to Russian news agencies. The ministry held its forecast at growth of just 0.5 percent this year, compared with 1.3 percent in 2013. A month ago, it had defiantly predicted growth of 1.0 percent when the West imposed its first sectoral sanctions over Moscow's support for pro-Russian rebels fighting in eastern Ukraine. But it has now slashed its forceast for 2015 in half, also to 1.0 percent. Russia's statistics office reported earlier this month that the economy grew by 0.8 percent in the second quarter on an annual comparison. Seasonally-adjusted quarterly data has yet to be released, which could show that Russia entered a technical recession as the economy contracted by 0.5 percent in the first three months of the year. Zasov said the seasonally-adjusted second quarter figure was "close to zero". However, he added: "We estimate that the situation will improve a bit in the third quarter and we'll have a positive figure." The head of the finance ministry's long-term planning unit said the economy ministry's annual forecast was too optimistic and that growth this year was likely to be close to zero. Alexander Demianchuk/ReutersA vendor sells sausages and meat products in St. Petersburg August 26, 2014. The West last month imposed its toughest sanctions yet on Russia, including restricting access to Western financial markets, over Moscow's alleged attempts to destabilise Ukraine. In response, Russia imposed sweeping bans on food from the United States, the European Union and a handful of other countries. The borrowing restrictions crimp the ability of Russian banks to lend just as flagging domestic demand has choked off growth and the government wants domestic companies to step up investment to reduce their reliance on the West. Officials have said that means the farm sector will need nearly $18 billion in additional investment to produce more of the country's food. Zasov said the cut in the 2015 outlook was primarily due to reduced investment prospects in the face of continued geopolitical tensions. "We had hoped that already next year investment would pick up significantly, above all in the private sector," he said. "But we see now tougher loan conditions on foreign markets, the introduction of additional sanctions, which we hadn't counted on before." The forecast for the flight of capital, which also deprives Russia of investment funds, was raised by $10 billion to $100 billion in 2015. Exports are expected to tumble 8.0 percent this year against a previous forecast of a 4.0 percent slide. Average Russians have been concerned the food bans will lead to rising prices, fears echoed in the economy ministry's latest inflation forecasts. The forecast for this year was raised to 7.2 percent from 6.0, and for 2015 to 6.5 percent from 5.0 percent. "The sanctions against Russia and our response played a certain role," acknowledged Zassov. Reuters / Ivan SekretarevRussia's President Vladimir Putin listens to his spokesman Dmitry Peskov before a meeting with his Finnish counterpart Sauli Niinisto at the Bocharov Ruchei state residence in Sochi August 15, 2014.Russia enjoyed growth rates of 7-8 percent a decade ago during Vladimir Putin's first two terms as president, but the economy had already slowed before the Ukraine crisis erupted. On Monday, Russia's economy minister urged an easing of budget rules to allow a bigger deficit to finance investments needed to overcome the West's punitive measures. Some analysts believe the sanctions were useful in exposing weaknesses in the Russian economy and prodding the government to act. "I think that the sanctions are playing a mobilising role for the growth of the economy," said Alexei Mukhin, director of the Centre for Political Information risk management company. However others believe the Russian economy is in for a rough ride. "The recession won't crash down like an avalanche, but gradually, and as is well known such crises hurt more," said Igor Nikolayev, head of the FBK Strategic Analysis Institute. He forecast it will be worse than the previous crisis, when Russia's economy contracted by nearly 8.0 percent in 2009. FREE AppDownload

AP(Reuters) - Ann Inc &lt;ann.n&gt; has hired JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co &lt;jpm.n&gt; to explore strategic alternatives, including a potential sale of the women's retailer, according to people familiar with the matter. The hiring of an investment bank comes as the Ann Taylor parent faces pressure from hedge funds Engine Capital LP and Red Alder LLC to consider selling itself to a private equity firm or a large international retailer. Shares of Ann jumped to over $40 per share on Monday after the funds, which together control more than 1 percent of the stock, said it could be worth $50 to $55 per share to a potential buyer. New York-based Ann has a market capitalization of roughly $1.8 billion. Representatives for Ann and JPMorgan declined to comment. Earlier this year, private equity firm Golden Gate Capital took a 9.5 percent stake in Ann, saying the company's stock was undervalued.   (Reporting by Olivia Oran and Soyoung Kim in New York; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe) FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersHP logo is seen outside Hewlett-Packard Belgian headquarters in DiegemWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard Co  is recalling about 6 million computer power cords after 29 reports of the cords melting or charring, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said on Tuesday. The recalled item, the LS-15 AC power cord, was distributed with Hewlett-Packard and Compaq notebook and mini notebook computers and with AC adapter-powered accessories such as docking stations, the commission said in a statement. "Customers should immediately stop using and unplug the recalled power cords and contact Hewlett-Packard to order a free replacement," the statement said. About 5.6 million power cords are being recalled in the United States, along with 446,700 in Canada. The cords were made in China. The Palo Alto, California-based company has received 29 reports of cords overheating and melting or charring. There have been two claims of minor burns and 13 claims of minor property damage, the statement said. The computers and accessories were sold with the AC power cords at electronics stores, dealers and online from September 2010 through June 2012 for about $500 to $1,500, the statement said.

"Avengers #29," Marvel Comics.Can't wait for the next Avengers movie? Try a comic book. Domestic sales of comics and graphic novels have been rising for years, reaching $870 million last year, up from $265 million in 2000, according to estimates by Comichron’s John Jackson Miller and ICv2’s Milton Griepp. This year could be even hotter, with July breaking all kinds of records for sales since 1997. Astonishingly, even the number of comic shops in America has been stable or growing in recent years. Rising revenue can be attributed partly to growth in graphic novels and digital comics, as well as higher prices, but it's also clear that readership is expanding. Last year's 85 million print unit sales for the top 300 comic books was the highest number since 2007, and that does not count increasingly significant graphic novel and digital sales nor a growing number of sales beyond the top 300. Even though total unit sales remain lower than during peaks in the 1950s or early 1990s, according to Miller, the comic book business is booming. Joe Scarnici/Getty ImagesActress Maitland Ward gets her cosplay on.One obvious reason for comic book gains is spillover interest from the movies adaptations that have dominated the box office in the past decade. In 2014 alone, there will be at least 12 comic book movies on the big screen. These adaptations have brought in not only new readers but also new types of readers. "The movies have helped expand the audience beyond the core young adult male demographic to include females of similar ages, as well as older and younger readers," Griepp writes by email. "That’s based on what comic retailers and publishers tell us and on observing the mix of fans at comic conventions, rather than on survey or other research data, but I believe it to be true." Looking at comic book conventions, it's easy to see what a mix of people are into comics these days, and it's no surprise that many conventions are getting bought out or otherwise going corporate. Digital technology has also increased readership by making it easier to buy and enjoy comics. No wonder Amazon bought ComiXology in April. As much as the movies and technology are helping the industry, however, even more credit should go to comic book creators. Most comics are simply better these days — and that's my personal opinion, but it's also a popular one. Comics books have become far more sophisticated since their debut last century. Contemporary mainstream comics can be excellent, while creative alternative comics are more plentiful than ever. Comics are often better than movies about the same characters, which makes sense when you think about it. Hundred-million-dollar movies are designed to reach the widest possible audience while also setting up sequels and spinoffs, which can result in something bland. Comics can meet the vision of a writer and a small team of artists with far fewer limits and nothing more at risk than cancelation. Jerod Harris / Getty ImagesSan Diego Comic-Con drew more than 130,000 people in 2014.So what comic books are worth reading? There are the classics like Alan Moore's "Watchmen" and Frank Miller's "Dark Knight Returns," not to mention other Miller masterpieces "Sin City," "300," and the less-known-but-amazing "Daredevil: Born Again." "The Walking Dead" by Robert Kirkman is excellent and in many ways better than its live-action adaptation, and the same can be said for "Kick-Ass" by Mark Millar and "Scott Pilgrim" by Bryan Lee O'Malley. For Marvel fans wanting to stick with characters they know, I can recommend several series that are on shelves now with back issues on ComiXology. DC fans will have to look elsewhere for advice. [Back-issue spoilers ahead.] Let's start with "Avengers" by Jonathan Hickman, a cerebral epic launched in 2012 as the primary title about Earth's mightiest heroes. In the frame at the top of the page taken from "Avengers 29," Steve Rogers has a flashback to a moment when he used the Infinity Gauntlet to prevent a collision of two universes. He goes on to remember how the Infinity Gauntlet was destroyed, how the Illuminati — a secret group of powerful men including Tony Stark — planned to build a new weapon that could be used to destroy an alternate universe, and how they wiped Roger's mind when he opposed them. Here's what happens next, in an illustration penciled by Leinil Yu: "Avengers 29," Marvel Comics. To see things from the perspective of the Illuminati, read Hickman's also good and even moodier "New Avengers." For something similarly ambitious but more fun, try "Uncanny Avengers" by Rick Remender, an Avengers and X-Men crossover the likes of which you won't see in the theater as long as Avengers belong to Disney and X-Men are licensed to Fox. Just check out the cool team assembled on the cover of "Uncanny Avengers 20" drawn by Daniel Acuña: "Uncanny Avengers #20," Marvel Comics. For something alternative, check out Matt Fraction's critically acclaimed "Hawkeye," which has already inspired a wave of superhero comics in indie style. Although featuring an Avenger, this clever series follows the mostly civilian adventures of Clint Barton in Bedford-Stuyvesant, including a Hurricane Sandy story last year and experimental narration devices such as the use of sign language and a story from the perspective of a dog.

Masters of the Universe aren't known for having anything resembling a jewelry collection except for one item — a watch. They're collectible, gorgeous and at times incredibly expensive pieces that can be handed down from generation to generation Exactly the type of thing a titan of any industry would want. We've put together a list and commentary about the wristwatches worn by some of Wall Street's most public executives.  As expected, a couple of the watches are flashy. A few of them are really, really cheap by Wall Street standards. And one prominent banker doesn't even wear a watch. Ever.  (If you know of the type of timepiece that an executive at your firm wears, feel free to send the tip to jlaroche@businessinsider.com) Check it out:  AP Images Buffett, the "Oracle of Omaha," wears a gold Rolex Day-Date.  Reuters/ Lucas JacksonGoldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein rocks a Swatch with what appears to be a clear plastic band. Swatch's tend to range between $50 to $245. It's also not exactly the sort of timepiece you'd expect a chief executive of a Wall Street investment bank to wear. Then again, Goldman is "the most hipster" bank on Wall Street.   Reuters/ Tim ShafferInvesting legend Jack Bogle, the founder of the Vanguard Group, wears a $14 wristwatch he received from a shareholder. "I received in the mail a wristwatch from a devoted shareholder in California. On the dial were printed our Vanguard logo, my name, and a phrase that was an indication I was still looking out for our shareholders: "Still on Watch." It was also an outrageous pun: "Still on Watch." Confident that it would be my rabbit’s foot, I put the watch on my wrist, where, having proved itself, it remains to this day. (Yes, I knew about the $50 limit on gifts. So I checked the catalog for the price. It was $14. Talk about value!)," he wrote.   Reuters/ Jessica Rinaldi We learned about Jeff Gundlach's watch collection when he had a bunch of his artwork and personal property stolen.   According to the Santa Monica Police Department report, the watches that were stolen included a Glashutte, Breitling, A.

Note from dshort: The NYSE has released new data for margin debt, now available through July. I've updated the charts in this commentary to include the latest numbers. The New York Stock Exchange publishes end-of-month data for margin debt on the NYXdata website, where we can also find historical data back to 1959. Let's examine the numbers and study the relationship between margin debt and the market, using the S&amp;P 500 as the surrogate for the latter. The first chart shows the two series in real terms — adjusted for inflation to today's dollar using the Consumer Price Index as the deflator. I picked 1995 as an arbitrary start date. We were well into the Boomer Bull Market that began in 1982 and approaching the start of the Tech Bubble that shaped investor sentiment during the second half of the decade. The astonishing surge in leverage in late 1999 peaked in March 2000, the same month that the S&amp;P 500 hit its all-time daily high, although the highest monthly close for that year was five months later in August. A similar surge began in 2006, peaking in July 2007, three months before the market peak. Debt hit a trough in February 2009, a month before the March market bottom. It then began another major cycle of increase. Margin debt hit an all-time high in February of this year. The latest Margin Data Unfortunately, the NYSE margin debt data is about a month old when it is published. Following its February peak, real margin declined sharply for two months, -3.9% in March -3.2% in April and was flat in May. It then jumped 5.7% in June, its largest gain in 17 months. The August number shows a fractional decline of 0.8%, which puts it 2.6% below its February peak.  Click for a larger image The next chart shows the percentage growth of the two data series from the same 1995 starting date, again based on real (inflation-adjusted) data. I've added markers to show the precise monthly values and added callouts to show the month. Margin debt grew at a rate comparable to the market from 1995 to late summer of 2000 before soaring into the stratosphere. The two synchronized in their rate of contraction in early 2001. But with recovery after the Tech Crash, margin debt gradually returned to a growth rate closer to its former self in the second half of the 1990s rather than the more restrained real growth of the S&amp;P 500. But by September of 2006, margin again went ballistic. It finally peaked in the summer of 2007, about three months before the market.  Click for a larger image After the market low of 2009, margin debt again went on a tear until the contraction in late spring of 2010. The summer doldrums promptly ended when Chairman Bernanke hinted of more quantitative easing in his August, 2010 Jackson Hole speech. The appetite for margin instantly returned, and the Fed periodically increased the easing until the beginning of tapering purchases now underway. NYSE Investor Credit Lance Roberts of STA Wealth Management analyzes margin debt in the larger context that includes free cash accounts and credit balances in margin accounts. Essentially, he calculates the Credit Balance as the sum of Free Credit Cash Accounts and Credit Balances in Margin Accounts minus Margin Debt. The chart below illustrates the mathematics of Credit Balance with an overlay of the S&amp;P 500. Note that the chart below is based on nominal data, not adjusted for inflation.  Click for a larger image Here's a slightly closer look at the data, starting with 1995. Also, I've inverted the S&amp;P 500 monthly closes and used markers to pinpoint the monthly close values.  Click for a larger image As I pointed out above, the NYSE margin debt data is a several weeks old when it is published. Thus, even though it may in theory be a leading indicator, a major shift in margin debt isn't immediately evident. Nevertheless, we see that the troughs in the monthly net credit balance preceded peaks in the monthly S&amp;P 500 closes by six months in 2000 and four months in 2007. The most recent S&amp;P 500 correction greater than 10% was the 19.39% selloff in 2011 from April 29th to October 3rd. Investor Credit hit a negative extreme in March 2011. There are too few peak/trough episodes in this overlay series to take the latest credit-balance data as a leading indicator of a major selloff in U.S. equities. But we'll definitely want to keep an eye on this metric in the months ahead. Note on the data: The NYSE website only posts the Free Credit Cash Accounts data back to 2003. The Free Credit Cash Accounts data back to 1980 is available on a fee basis from Haver Analytics. FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersA BNY Mellon sign is seen on their headquarters in New York's financial districtBUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina said on Tuesday it had stripped Bank of New York Mellon's &lt;bk.n&gt; authorization to operate in the South American country, its latest move against the financial institution which obeyed a U.S. court ruling that tipped it into default. Argentina's Congress is due on Wednesday to discuss a law that would replace BONY as intermediary for payments on foreign law bonds with the state-controlled bank Banco Nacion, as part of a new debt restructuring plan. BONY in June obeyed a U.S. court ruling to block a $539 million interest payment on debt that was restructured following Argentina's record 2002 debt default, paving the way for the country's second default in 12 years in July. The court had ruled Argentina could not pay holders of restructured bonds unless it also paid so-called "holdout" U.S. investment funds, which refused its 2005 and 2010 bond swaps in the wake of the 2002 default on about $100 billion of debt. The central bank "has revoked BNY's authorization for representation in Argentina," Cabinet Chief Jorge Capitanich said in his daily briefing. The authorization applied specifically to two BONY officials. The central bank said it took the measure because the U.S. bank failed to fulfill technical requirements to operate in the country. A central bank source said on condition of anonymity that revoking BONY's authorization would not prevent it from transferring the frozen $539 million on to bondholders if it decided to fulfill the payment. BONY can appeal the measure and put forward new officials for authorization to operate in the country, but the central bank could refuse to accept them, the source added.   (Reporting by Jorge Otaola and Sarah Marsh; Editing by Richard Lough and Tom Brown) FREE AppDownload
RamTrucks.comThe Ram 1500 EcoDieselDETROIT (Reuters) - The Chrysler Group's Ram 1500 EcoDiesel was named the top full-size pickup truck in the U.S. market and Toyota's Highlander the top mid-size SUV by Consumer Reports, the magazine said on Tuesday. The Ram 1500 EcoDiesel's superior fuel economy ratings of 20 miles per gallon overall and 27 mpg on the highway helped push it over the top in the competitive field, edging the second-place Ram 1500 V8 and the third-place General Motors Co &lt;gm.n&gt; Chevrolet Silverado 1500. In Consumer Reports' road tests, the Ram EcoDiesel scored an 82, followed by the Ram 1500 V8 at 81, the Silverado and the Sierra at 80, Ford Motor Co's &lt;f.n&gt; F-150 EcoBoost V6 at 70, and the F-150 V8 at 69. "The continued interior and powertrain improvements make the Ram a particularly well-rounded choice for most consumers," the magazine said in a statement. Pickup trucks are the keys to profit for American automakers. Later this year, Ford will introduce an F-150 with more aluminum and improved fuel economy. The current V8 version gets 15 mpg overall and 22 mpg on the highway, according to Consumer Reports. Toyota Motor Corp's &lt;7203.T&gt; Highlander took the top two spots in its category. The hybrid version was first among midsize SUVs and the gasoline version second. Chrysler's Jeep Grand Cherokee diesel version was third in the ratings, followed by Hyundai Motor Co's &lt;005380.KS&gt; Santa Fe and Nissan Motor Co's &lt;7201.T&gt; Murano. Toyota last week announced that it would increase production of the Highlander at its plant in Indiana by investing $100 million and adding 300 jobs by the summer of 2016. Consumer Reports says it gathers at least a year of field data on a vehicle's reliability before it offers a "recommended" rating. Among full-size pickup trucks, Consumer Reports recommends the Ram 1500 gasoline V8, the Ford F-150 V8, and the Toyota Tundra. The Ram EcoDiesel and the both the Silverado 1500 and the GMC Sierra are too new on the market to have comparative reliability ratings, it noted. Through July, the F-150 pickups were the top-selling vehicles in the U.S. market, followed by the Silverado, the Toyota Camry sedan and the Ram pickups, according to Autodata Corp.

For investors, the conversation about value in 3D printing stocks depends on one's time horizon. Last year, Goldman Sachs named the sector as one of its eight "creative destructor" industries that would remake the global economy. Analyst Cristina Colón presented the following chart showing a 16% 10-year compound annual growth rate. Goldman Sachs "3D printing is penetrating the automotive, aerospace, and medical industries, among others," she wrote. "For example, Boeing now 3D prints 300 distinct airplane parts, noting a 25% to 50% cost savings per part. As materials properties improve and processes become more robust, 3D printing could become increasingly appealing for end-parts production." The two largest publicly traded 3D printing firms have seen solid growth in recent years, but they have experienced a difficult 2014. Shares of Stratasys (SSYS), America's largest 3D printing company, have climbed more than 50% since August 2012 but are down 17% since Jan. 1. Likewise, 3D Systems (DDD) is up nearly 90% since summer 2012 but off approximately 45% this year.  The consensus seems to be this recent performance is not so much a no-confidence vote in the sector but more of a cooling-off period after the extreme run-up in interest that 3D printing saw last year among investors.  RBC Capital's Amit Daryanani remains bullish on the sector, calling it a "hyper-growth market" in a July note. The most recent evidence one could point to is Amazon's announcement in July that it would team up with two smaller 3D printing firms to offer 200 unique print-on-demand products, customizable in limitless ways. As Marketwatch's Ben Pimental recently noted, Petra Schindler-Carter, Amazon’s director of marketplace sales, said the move “suggests the beginnings of a shift in online retail — that manufacturing can be more nimble to provide an immersive customer experience.” And Piper Jaffray analyst Troy Jensen called Amazon's announcement “another validation regarding the future growth” for the 3-D printer industry. Our two main 3D printing firms weren't directly affected by Amazon's announcement. Still, each have its own intrinsic advantages and are likely to benefit from the increased interest the announcement is likely to generate. Let's take a look. YahooShares of 3D Systems and Stratasys have seen solid growth in recent years. With 57% of the 3D printing space's market share, Stratasys sits atop the industry. The firm is seeing healthy demand across all its markets, especially for MakerBot, the desktop 3D printer it acquired the rights to in the fall of 2013. RBC's Daryanani notes the firm recently updated its long-term operating model to suggest higher organic revenue growth of 25% from 20% prior, and raised his price target to $130. Shares currently trade at close to $115. "The firm should be able to sustain high double-digit revenue growth and industry-leading profitability as it benefits from a rapidly expanding additive manufacturing market and installed base," he writes. Besides its market share, Daryanani likes the firm's wide range of printer capabilities, priced between $2,200 and $600,000. This "should enable it to capture a sustained upturn in industry growth," he says. He also notes MakerBot sales have doubled to $34 million. "The sustained strong growth of consumable sales (which includes MakerBot) suggests to us a greater installed base of printers is beginning to drive meaningful growth in higher-margin material demand," he says.  Earlier this year, a Credit Suisse team led by Jonathan Shaffer said Stratasys should come to dominate what he called the "prosumer" market of engineers, architects, educators, along with consumers, thanks to Stratasys' MakerBot, which rival 3D Systems doesn't have an answer to. He ended up revising this market segment's potential up more than 360% to $806 million. "We draw a distinction between the prosumer (engineers, architects, education for desktop ideation and design prototyping) and consumer markets (home desktop printing with smaller build boxes primarily for trinkets)," he writes. "Our analysis focuses on engineers and architects as primary prosumer customers; these are quantifiable groups with clear use cases; however, we do not think the opportunity is limited to these groups. High-level hobbyists, for instance, continue to be a significant growth driver; the number of amateur "tinkerers" is simply difficult to estimate as are non-engineer product designers. SSYS has much higher exposure to the consumer and prosumer markets than does DDD." Here's his comparison between 3D and Stratasys to the consumer and prosumer market: Credit Suisse Stratasys now enjoys a gross margin of 59.8%, which is 60 points higher than where it was a year ago. Revenue from Stratasys' services component climbed 50% quarter-on-quarter, although its Redeye parts division has now under-performed for three-straight quarters. But RBC's Daryanani says recent acquisitions should allow this division to grow 79% YOY for 2014. T. Rowe Price is Stratasys' largest shareholder. As of June 30 it controlled 10.75% of shares outstanding at a value of $604 million. Stratasys now employs more than 1,500 people in 20+ offices worldwide. It is based n Minneapolis and Israel.  "Triple D," as it's often known because of its stock ticker, was founded in 1986 by Charles Hull, the man considered to have invented 3D printing. Headquartered in Rock Hill, S.C., 3D Systems employs more than 1,000 people in 25 offices worldwide. RBC's Daryanani says he remains bullish on DDD despite some recent setbacks that caused him to lower his price target to $64 from $78. Shares currently trade at around $50 a share. His base case sees shares growing 28% long term. DDD boasts 18% of the 3D printing market share, a solid position from which to capitalize on the industry's growth. 3D Systems has seven distinct types of printing lines, making it the most diverse printer in the market and allowing it to address multiple end-users. Its business lines run the gamut: hardware, materials, software, and services. Its printer speeds have doubled every 18 months, and it now has more than 15 metal materials to choose from.  "DDD has built an attractive services, materials, and on-demand portfolio that should increase customer stickiness and visibility into future profits," Daryanani says. DDD enjoys lots of "dry powder" in the form of $600 million in cash, and an average free cash flow of 70% of income, with which to make deals, he writes. DDD's 'Quickparts' unit, which allows customers to do rapid prototyping; materials development; medical; and metal services are most ripe for expansion, he says.  The risks are not insubstantial. In Daryanani's bear case, shares slide back to $40 if small-scale prototyping and hobbyists come to comprise too large a share of the market. DDD has also become heavily reliant on acquiring other firms — 40 in the past four years. "If it has difficultly integrating recent acquisitions along with slower industry growth expectations, we think operating leverage could be affected negatively," he writes. Still, Daryanani writes that they will do approximately $1 billion in sales in FY15, up from about $700 million in FY2014. The Vanguard Group is 3D Systems' largest institutional shareholder with 5.35% of shares outstanding valued at $351 million as of June 30.  Beyond these two companies, there are three other publicly traded firms worth watching. One is an American firm that specializes in additive manufacturing though is not strictly 3D. The other two are German companies specializing in industrial-scale 3D printing, and both have struggled of late. Shares in Minnesota-based Proto Labs Inc. (PRLB) have climbed 165% since its 2012 IPO. The company promises “Real Parts, Really Fast” but uses a proprietary form of traditional CNC machining and injection molding processes to do so. However, it recently bought a 3D printing firm, and Jefferies analyst Jason North says Proto Labs stands to benefit from the broader 3D trend, at least initially. "By leveraging its proprietary technology to accelerate conventional manufacturing processes, the company has built a disruptive business model, significantly lowering the time to delivery at prices that are typically below those of traditional operators," North writes. "In the near-term Proto Labs and 3D printing are complementary as 3D printing prototypes are often used in the design phase and Proto Labs prototypes tend to be used more for form-and-fit and functional testing. While initially small at first, parts that can only be manufactured using 3D printing will not be prototyped using Proto Labs’ traditional processes but on 3D printers. And as the capabilities of 3D printers continue to expand, we expect to see increasing competition with Proto Labs." ExOne, which trades on the NASDAQ as XONE, has seen its shares fall more than 50% YTD, and at $30 it's now just 7% higher than its February 2013 IPO price. German firm Voxeljet, which trades on the New York Stock Exchange as VJET, specializes in industrial 3D printing and on-demand metal casting. It too has seen equally disastrous performance, falling 47% from its late 2013 IPO. In April, The Wall Street Journal's Matt Jarzemsky reported it had sold 3 million shares for $15 each. That was 19% below its predeal closing price. As of April 11, U.S.-listed follow-on offerings had priced at an average 5.4% below their predeal closing prices, Jarzemsky said. Goldman's Colón is convinced the market for 3D is explosive. She values the immediate market at $2.2 billion, with a $30 billion value chain. Colón cites a consulting firm that has forecast a 23% compound annual growth rate from 2013 to 2020, with annual revenues reaching $6 billion by 2017 and $10.8 billion by 2021. "Compared to traditional manufacturing and prototyping methods, 3D printing offers the potential for high degrees of customization, reduced costs for complex designs, and lower overhead costs for short-run parts and products," she writes. "The industry has been growing in excess of 20% annually and is widely expected to accelerate in the years ahead." Jefferies' North is more measured in his forecast, especially for the consumer market, noting that early results from Amazon's foray have been disappointing. But he remains optimistic overall. "Penetration analysis indicates several more years of good growth," he writes. "We estimate the prototyping/prosumer/education penetration rate is currently 9%-23% and will rise to 29%-76% in 2017, assuming the low-end (&lt;$5000) grows at 30%-50% and the high-end (&gt;$5000) at 25%. The range in [total addressable market] sizes depends on how far 3D printing will engage not just MCAD users who are already heavy prototypers but also the general CAD user." Gartner Group believes the consumer 3D printing remains quite immature. "Consumer 3D printing is around five to 10 years away from mainstream adoption," Gartner research vice president Pete Basiliere said in a statement Aug. 20, noting that even at a few hundred dollars the average price for a 3D printer remains too high for many consumers. He said the market remains too diffuse, with about 40 manufacturers selling 3D printers and over 200 startups worldwide developing and selling consumer-oriented 3D printers. But it's better to be too early than too late. FREE AppDownload
After a miserable summer, crude prices have come surging back as the ISIS militant group continues to make gains in the Middle East. London-traded Brent was trading around $103 Tuesday, near a two-week high and up 2% from recent lows. Until this week prices had come down as much as 12% from a June high.  Barclays has noted that those declines were masking run-ups at the long-end of the Brent contract's futures curve. "One of the most significant changes in oil market dynamics in recent months has been a rapid increase in far forward oil prices, with Dec-18 contracts trading at $98/bl, compared with the $86-95/bl range in which it has traded for the past three years," they write in a note Tuesday. "In our view, the upward move in the Dec-2018 could prove sticky, as the oil market continues to reassess long-term oil market fundamentals in light of the deteriorating prospects of Iraq’s oil sector in the medium term."

New York Public Library Digital ArchivesStocks were higher on Tuesday, with the S&amp;P 500 back above the 2,000 in early trade after mixed economic data.  The Dow was up 42 points, the S&amp;P 500 was up 3 points, and the Nasdaq was up 3 points. Earlier on Tuesday, the latest report on durable goods orders showed orders rose 22.6% in July, a new record increase for the index. This number was largely influence by a surge in aircraft orders during July, which some analysts attributed to the London Farnborough Airshow held in July.  The S&amp;P Case-Shiller home price index declined for the second straight month, and for the first time February 2008, all cities in the 20-city index showed lower annual rates than the previous month.  The Richmond Federal Reserve's latest manufacturing report came in at a 12 for the headline composite reading, better than the 7 that was expected by economists.  The Conference Board's latest report on consumer confidence for August came in at 92.4, topping expectations for 89 and better than July's revised reading of 90.3.  Burger King and Tim Horton's officially announced their plan to merge in a deal that will create a new company based in Canada.

Wikimedia CommonsCSF cytology of a diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.Shares of Kite Pharma are exploding higher, up 17%. On Monday afternoon, the now-$1 billion biotech firm revealed positive outcomes from patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma after receiving its anti-CD19 treatment. "The findings from an ongoing Phase 1-2a clinical trial funded by Kite and conducted by the Surgery Branch of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) demonstrated that in 12 out of 13 evaluable patients with advanced B-cell malignancies, administration of anti-CD19 CAR T cells resulted in complete remission in eight patients and partial remission in four patients, representing an overall objective response rate of 92%," the company said. "Of seven evaluable patients with chemotherapy-refractory DLBCL, four achieved complete remission, three of which are ongoing with durations ranging from 9 to 22 months." "We are greatly encouraged by the strong results we have seen from our joint lead clinical program with the NCI," said CEO Arie Belldegrun, M.D., FACS. "Based on this substantial progress, Kite plans to file an IND in the fourth quarter of this year to initiate a Phase 1-2 single-arm multicenter clinical trial of KTE-C19 in patients with DLBCL who have failed two or more lines of therapy. We are excited to advance this promising therapy and anticipate commencing patient enrollment in our DLBCL clinical trial in the first half of 2015." Shares of small publicly traded biotech firms tend to be very volatile, as their businesses often rely on the unlikely breakthroughs of a very narrow pipeline of drugs. "Lots of sophisticated investors purchase biotech companies that have no earnings and are regularly raising cash to stay in business," stock market expert Ed Yardeni said. "These investors do so knowing that the outcomes are binary: The companies they invest in will either find a cure for a disease or they won’t. Their new drugs will either be approved by the FDA or they won’t. They might be acquired for a huge premium or they might not, or might go out of business." For now, Kite is looking more like a winner than a loser. Here's the full press release:  Phase 1-2a Clinical Trial Highlights: SANTA MONICA, Calif., Aug. 25, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kite Pharma, Inc., (Nasdaq:KITE), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing engineered autologous T cell therapy (eACT™) products for the treatment of cancer, today announced the publication of clinical results in a cohort of patients demonstrating the potential to treat aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with an anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy. Kite's most advanced product candidate, KTE-C19, is an anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapy that involves genetically modifying a patient's T cells to express a CAR that is designed to target CD19, a protein expressed on the cell surface of B cell lymphomas and leukemias. The findings from an ongoing Phase 1-2a clinical trial funded by Kite and conducted by the Surgery Branch of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) demonstrated that in 12 out of 13 evaluable patients with advanced B-cell malignancies, administration of anti-CD19 CAR T cells resulted in complete remission in eight patients and partial remission in four patients, representing an overall objective response rate of 92%. Of seven evaluable patients with chemotherapy-refractory DLBCL, four achieved complete remission, three of which are ongoing with durations ranging from 9 to 22 months. These findings are being published in an article titled, "Chemotherapy-refractory Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma and Indolent B-cell Malignancies Can Be Effectively Treated with Autologous T Cells Expressing an Anti-CD19 Chimeric Antigen Receptor," DOI: 10.1200/JCO.2014.56.2025, which is appearing in the August 25, 2014 issue of the American Society of Clinical Oncology's Journal of Clinical Oncology. Kite and the Surgery Branch of the NCI, led by Steven A. Rosenberg, M.D., Ph.D., are collaborating under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) for the research and development of eACT™ based product candidates for the treatment of multiple cancer indications. The reported Phase 1-2a clinical trial is being conducted at the NCI with Dr. Rosenberg serving as principal investigator. Additional authors of the published study include James N. Kochenderfer, M.D., who presented earlier data for the NCI from the trial at the 55th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting in December 2013. David Chang, M.D., Ph.D., Kite Pharma's Executive Vice President, Research and Development, and Chief Medical Officer, commented, "To date, Kite and the NCI have conducted an extensive program to investigate personalized T cell immunotherapies for blood cancers and solid tumors, including in patients with refractory DLBCL. Both the high overall response rate and the durability of the complete remissions are noteworthy, and we believe our anti-CD19-CAR T cell approach holds great potential for the treatment of B cell malignancies, including those with aggressive, resistant disease for which there are no viable treatment options." Ronald Levy, M.D., Professor of Medicine, Director of the Lymphoma Program and Former Chief of the Division of Oncology at Stanford University and member of Kite's Scientific Advisory Board, commented, "I have been impressed by the results reported and updated from Dr. Rosenberg's group at the NCI. Particularly compelling are the frequency and the duration of the responses obtained in the difficult-to-treat patient population with relapsed, refractory lymphomas." Dr. Levy serves as a consultant to Kite and is helping to guide the Company in their upcoming clinical trials. "We are greatly encouraged by the strong results we have seen from our joint lead clinical program with the NCI," commented Arie Belldegrun, M.D., FACS, Kite's President and Chief Executive Officer. "Based on this substantial progress, Kite plans to file an IND in the fourth quarter of this year to initiate a Phase 1-2 single-arm multicenter clinical trial of KTE-C19 in patients with DLBCL who have failed two or more lines of therapy. We are excited to advance this promising therapy and anticipate commencing patient enrollment in our DLBCL clinical trial in the first half of 2015." Key Study Findings The published clinical trial results relate to patients in the second cohort in the NCI's Phase 1-2a clinical trial of anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapy. The second cohort consists of 15 patients, including two retreated patients from a prior cohort, with advanced B cell malignancies, of which 13 were evaluable for responses, including seven with chemotherapy-refractory DLBCL. Patients received a conditioning regimen of chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide and fludarabine) followed one day later by a single infusion of anti-CD19-CAR T cells. The CAR-expressing T cells were produced from each patient's own peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), modified using a gammaretroviral vector encoding the CAR, as well as a CD28 costimulatory moiety. Of the seven evaluable chemotherapy-refractory DLBCL patients, six showed a response (four complete remissions and two partial remissions), and one had stable disease. Duration of ongoing complete responses ranged from 9 to 22 months in patients with chemotherapy-refractory DLBCL and from 11 to 23 months in the patients with either chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or indolent lymphoma. Pursuant to the study protocol, patients are continuing to be monitored for duration of response. Updated results will be reported at the appropriate peer-reviewed forum. Summary of Efficacy Findings: (1) Includes one patient with DLBCL that transformed from chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and three patients with primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma, a subtype of DLBCL. As seen in other studies, infusion of anti-CD19 CAR T cells was associated with significant, acute toxicities, including fever, low blood pressure, focal neurological deficits, and delirium. About Kite Pharma Kite Pharma, Inc., is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the development of novel cancer immunotherapy products, with a primary focus on eACT™ designed to restore the immune system's ability to recognize and eradicate tumors. In partnership with the NCI Surgery Branch through a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA), Kite is advancing a pipeline of proprietary eACT™ product candidates, both CAR (chimeric antigen receptor) and TCR (T cell receptor) products, directed to a wide range of cancer indications.  Kite is based in Santa Monica, CA. For more information on Kite Pharma, please visit www.kitepharma.com.

Thomson ReutersPeople shop at H&M on Thanksgiving Day in New York(Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence rose in August to its highest level since October 2007 on improved feelings about the current state of the economy, according to a private sector report released on Tuesday. The Conference Board, an industry group, said its index of consumer attitudes rose to 92.4 from a downwardly revised 90.3 the month before. Economists had expected a reading of 89, according to a Reuters poll. July's reading was originally reported as 90.9. "Consumer confidence increased for the fourth consecutive month as improving business conditions and robust job growth helped boost consumers' spirits," Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at The Conference Board, said in a statement. The expectations index fell to 90.9 from a revised 91.9 figure, while the present situation index rose to 94.6, highest since February 2008, from 87.9. Consumers' labor market assessment improved. The "jobs hard to get" index fell to 30.6 percent from 30.9 percent the month before, while the "jobs plentiful" index rose to 18.2 percent from 15.6 percent. Consumers also expect a slight increase in inflation, with expectations for inflation in the coming 12 months up to 5.5 percent from 5.4 percent.

Facebook The American fast-food chain has agreed to merge with Canadian coffee and donut chain Tim Hortons. As a result, Burger King will become a Canadian company and will be able to take advantage of a lower corporate tax rate via a tax inversion. Tax inversions have become a big corporate trend as companies seek to lower their tax bills. This time, though, we have a major household name taking advantage of it, and people have noticed. Thousands of Burger King's seven-million-plus Facebook fans have described the fast-food restaurant with words like "traitor" and "un-American."

AP ImagesConsumer confidence surged in August. According to the Conference Board's new report, the consumer confidence index jumped to 92.4 in August, the highest level since October 2007. This is up from 90.3 in July, and it was much stronger than the 89.0 forecasted by economists. "Consumer confidence increased for the fourth consecutive month as improving business conditions and robust job growth helped boost consumers’ spirits," said the Conference Board's Lynn Franco. "Looking ahead, consumers were marginally less optimistic about the short-term outlook compared to July, primarily due to concerns about their earnings. Overall, however, they remain quite positive about the short-term outlooks for the economy and labor market." From the Conference Board: Consumers’ appraisal of current conditions continued to improve through August. Those saying business conditions are “good” edged up to 23.9 percent from 23.3 percent, while those claiming business conditions are “bad” declined to 21.5 percent from 22.8 percent. Consumers’ assessment of the job market was also more positive. Those stating jobs are “plentiful” increased to 18.2 percent from 15.6 percent, while those claiming jobs are “hard to get” declined marginally to 30.6 percent from 30.9 percent. Consumers were slightly less optimistic in August about the short-term outlook. The percentage of consumers expecting business conditions to improve over the next six months held steady at 20.4 percent, while those expecting business conditions to worsen fell to 10.2 percent from 12.1 percent. Consumers, however, were somewhat mixed about the outlook for the labor market. Those anticipating more jobs in the months ahead fell to 17.0 percent from 18.7 percent, although those anticipating fewer jobs also declined to 15.8 percent from 16.6 percent. Fewer consumers expect their incomes to grow, 15.5 percent in August versus 17.7 percent in July, while those expecting a drop in their incomes rose marginally to 11.9 percent from 11.1 percent. "The rise was driven by an increase in the current situation index, to 94.6 from 87.9, while the expectations index declined, to 90.9 from 91.9," said Capital Economics' Paul Dales. "On the face of it, the latter is still consistent with annualised real consumption growth of around 3%. Given the weakness of retail sales in July, 3% looks like a tough target for the third quarter. But with income growth accelerating and equity prices hitting record highs, it looks perfectly possible for the fourth quarter." "While the expectations index has been volatile in recent years, the present situation index has been steadily trending higher over that time, mirroring improvements in housing and labor markets," said Barclays' Michael Gapen. "We expect this pattern to continue over the medium term and look for consumer confidence to remain on a broadly upward trend as a result." Here's a historical look: @cigolo FREE AppDownload

REUTERS/Jo Yong-Hak Warren BuffettTim Hortons and Burger King have confirmed that they plan to merge and move their combined company's tax domicile to Canada. This maneuver is known as a tax inversion, and these types of deal have had Congress in an uproar as they enable once-U.S. corporations to stop paying taxes in the U.S. and pay them elsewhere. Perhaps the most peculiar aspect of this deal is the involvement of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. The Wall Street Journal first reported on this on Monday evening. Buffett is a vocal proponent of having wealthy Americans pay higher taxes. However, Berkshire is effectively helping Burger King dodge taxes. Specifically, Berkshire Hathaway will be providing $3 billion in preferred equity financing. "Berkshire is simply a financing source and will not have any participation in the management and operation of the business," the companies said in their announcement today. Preferred equity allows the investor to receive a dividend while gaining equity like exposure to the company. These securities are senior to common equity but subordinate relative to debt. In other words, they tend to be safer than the stocks, but they offer better returns than bonds. Burger King shares were already up as much as 22% on Monday following the news that the company was in negotiations to take over the Canadian doughnut chain.  As Business Insider's Haley Peterson has written, the offer is most likely part of a huge cost-cutting plan for Burger King, which has been trying to reinvent itself in recent years. The deal will allow Burger King to move its headquarters to Canada, which could help it save money on taxes. After the takeover, Burger King and Tim Hortons will have 18,000 restaurants in 100 countries, and the company will be worth about $18 billion.  Burger KingDaniel Schwartz.In an in-depth article this summer called "Burger King Is Run By Children," Bloomberg Businessweek noted the fast-food giant had been acting more like a startup than a burger chain lately.  3G Capital, a Brazilian private equity firm, bought Burger King for $4 billion in a leveraged buyout in 2010, that article pointed out. 3G also owns H.J. Heinz along with Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. 3G's cofounder, a 74-year-old billionaire, likes to bring in young executives to shake things up, Bloomberg Businessweek reported.  In just 13 months on the job, Burger King's 33-year-old CEO Daniel Schwartz fundamentally restructured the burger chain, as BI's Hayley Peterson noted last month.  A wunderkind with no fast-food experience, Schwartz spent his first months on the job making burgers, cleaning toilets, and interacting with customers in actual Burger King restaurants. He soon realized a complicated menu was slowing things down, so he streamlined Burger King's offerings.  His restructuring appears to be paying off. In the first quarter of this year, Burger King's net income nearly doubled to $60.4 million. FREE AppDownload
Justin OttoS&amp;P's Case-Shiller home price index has declined for the second straight month. June prices fell 0.2%, worse than the consensus estimate for no change and the same rate of decline seen in May. Year-over-year, prices climbed 8.1%, about in-line with forecasts but slower than a revised 9.4% gain for May and a 17-month low. “Home price gains continue to ease as they have since last fall,” David M. Blitzer, chairman of the Index Committee at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, said in a release. “For the first time since February 2008, all cities showed lower annual rates than the previous month. Other housing indicators — starts, existing home sales, and builders’ sentiment — are positive. Taken together, these point to a more normal housing sector." Pantheon Macro's Ian Shepherdson is not concerned in the short run but expects things to get worse after autumn: "The CS measure as published is a three-month moving average, so it tends to lag shifts in the median price numbers published in the existing home sales report. In turn, those numbers lag shifts in home sales volumes, so we are inclined to see this softening in the CS data as a response to the drop in existing home sales during the severe winter. Sales have recovered all that drop and median prices have rebounded too; the CS numbers can be expected to follow in the fall. Thereafter, though, we are struggling to see where sustained momentum in sales and price might come from, given the latest downshift in mortgage applications." Here's what it's looked like recently: S&P Month-over-month, everyone's gains were no better than paltry.

Benny ZhengDurable goods orders surged 22.6% in July, associated with a massive increase in aircraft orders.  The report showed that transportation orders were up 74.2%, but excluding transportation, new orders decreased 0.8%, though this compares with a revised June number that showed orders ex-transport rose 3% instead of a previously reported 0.8%.  In a note to clients ahead of the report, Ethan Harris at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said a large number of orders from the London Farnborough Airshow drove the surge in aircraft orders. In July, Boeing reported orders for 324 aircraft, up from 109 in June.  Excluding defense, new orders were up 24.9% in July, and non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft fell 0.5% in July.  This is the largest increase in the headline reading for durable orders ever, topping the previous record of a 16.6% increase in June 2000.  Following the report, Ian Shepherdson at Pantheon Macro said: "In one line: Headline is wild, details more encouraging than -0.8% ex-transport number suggests." Expectations were for orders to increase 8% in July. Paul Dales said the 1.5% increase in non-transport, non-defense capital goods orders suggested that business investment in equipment was "on course to rise rapidly in the third quarter." There was a massive range of expectations for this report, with some economists expecting this to push the headline increase in durable goods orders as high as 30%.   The June durable goods report was also revised up to a 2.7% increase from a previous reading of 0.7%.  Bloomberg Economist Michael McDonough tweeted the following chart, which shows the massive rise in orders. @M_McDonough FREE AppDownload

REUTERS/China Daily An employee checks newly-assembled electric cars to be exported to South America at an electric vehicle factory in Zouping county, Shandong province September 24, 2013. China could deploy as much as 100 billion yuan, or $16 billion, to build more charging facilities and spur demand for electric vehicles, according to two people familiar with the matter, BloombergBusinessweek reports.  The sources Bloomberg spoke with said the policy would be announced soon, but they would not reveal details about things like whether the chargers would be complementary with or competitors to Tesla. "Increased state funding would be a tailwind for carmakers coping with consumer concerns over the price, reliability and convenience of electric vehicles," Bloomberg writes. "It would also build on efforts by China, the world’s biggest carbon emitter, to fight pollution and cultivate its local EV industry, which includes BYD Co. (1211) and Kandi Technologies Group Inc."  Tesla recently settled a trademark dispute with a Chinese national, and CEO Elon Musk told investors on the company's most recent conference call that the company was aiming to open 100 Tesla stores in China by the end of next year. "I've been very impressed with the Tesla China team and the quality of people that we're attracting in China," he said. "I mean I think the China team is smart and they work super-hard, so. And the pace of progress is just amazing. So I feel pretty comfortable about being able to do good service in China or great service actually."

AP ImagesTim Hortons and Burger King have announced a pact to merge. Together, they will have over 18,000 restaurants in over 100 countries generating about $23 billion in annual sales. The combined Canadian coffee chain and U.S. burger chain will have its global headquarters in Canada. Rumors of the merger first circulated on Sunday, when The Wall Street Journal's Liz Hoffman and Dana Mattoli reported the two companies were seeking "a deal that would be structured as a so-called tax inversion." In a tax inversion, two international companies merge and move their tax domicile to the lower tax country. In this case, Burger King would on paper move to Canada, which means taxes that would be paid to the U.S. would now be heading north. "The current Tim Hortons headquarters in Oakville, Ontario, will continue to be the global home of the Tim Hortons business. Burger King's current headquarters in Miami, Florida, will continue to be the global home of the Burger King business," management said. "It is expected that the shares of the new parent company will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange and the Toronto Stock Exchange. " Wall Street's top financiers are playing a huge role. 3G Capital will own 51% of the combined company. And Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway will be providing $3 billion in preferred equity financing. "Berkshire is simply a financing source and will not have any participation in the management and operation of the business," the companies said in the announcement. Tim Hortons shareholders will receive $65.50 in cash per share and 0.8025 of a share in the new parent company. All in, this makes each share of Tim Hortons worth about $89.32. Each share of Burger King will be converted into 0.99 of a share of the new company. Here's the press release: OAKVILLE, ON and MIAMI, FL, Aug. 26, 2014 /PRNewswire/ - An agreement was reached today to create the world's third largest quick service restaurant company. Tim Hortons Inc. (TSX, NYSE: THI) and Burger King Worldwide Inc. (BKW) today announced a definitive agreement under which the two companies will create a new global powerhouse in the quick service restaurant sector. With approximately $23 billion in system sales, over 18,000 restaurants in 100 countries and two strong, thriving, independent brands, the new company will have an extensive international footprint and significant growth potential. The new global company will be based in Canada, the largest market of the combined company. Tim Hortons and Burger King each have strong franchisee networks and iconic brands that are loved by their guests. Following the closing of the transaction, each brand will be managed independently, while benefitting from global scale and reach and sharing of best practices that will come with common ownership by the new company. Under the terms of the transaction, which has been unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of both companies, Tim Hortons shareholders will receive C$65.50 in cash and 0.8025 common shares of the new company per Tim Hortons share. Based on Burger King's unaffected closing stock price as of August 22, 2014, this represents total value per Tim Hortons share of C$89.32 and based on Burger King's closing stock price as of August 25, 2014, this represents total value per Tim Hortons share of C$94.05.  As an alternative to the default mixed transaction consideration described above, each Tim Hortons shareholder will have the ability to elect to instead receive, for each Tim Hortons share held, either (i) C$88.50 in cash; or (ii) 3.0879 common shares of the new company, in each case subject to pro ration. The C$89.32 unaffected offer value represents a premium of 39% based on the volume weighted average price of Tim Hortons stock over the past 30 days ending Friday August 22, 2014, and a 30% premium based on Tim Hortons closing stock price on August 22, 2014. By receiving shares in the new parent company, Tim Hortons shareholders will have the opportunity to participate in the new company's long-term value creation potential. Alex Behring, Executive Chairman of Burger King and Managing Partner of 3G Capital, said, "By bringing together our two iconic companies under common ownership, we are creating a global QSR powerhouse. Our combined size, international footprint and industry-leading growth trajectory will deliver superb value and opportunity for both Burger King and Tim Hortons shareholders, our dedicated employees, strong franchisees, and partners. We have great respect for the Tim Hortons team and look forward to working together to realize the full potential of these two extraordinary businesses." Marc Caira, President and CEO of Tim Hortons, said, "We are very proud of the great history of our organization and the progress we have achieved in creating value and delivering the ultimate experience for our guests. As an independent brand within the new company, this transaction will enable us to move more quickly and efficiently to bring Tim Hortons iconic Canadian brand to a new global customer base. At the same time, our customers, employees, franchisees and fellow Canadians can all rest assured that Tim Hortons will still be Tim Hortons following this transaction,  including our core values, employee and franchisee relationships, community support and fresh coffee." "Over the past four years, we have transformed Burger King into one of the fastest-growing and most profitable QSR businesses in the world, through successful international growth, a consistent focus on brand revitalization and strong commitment to our franchisees," said Daniel Schwartz, CEO of Burger King.  "We are excited to build on this progress as we continue to expand Burger King around the world and look forward to working with and learning from Tim Hortons as we together create the world's leading global restaurant business." Management and Governance At the time of closing, Alex Behring, Executive Chairman of Burger King and Managing Partner at 3G Capital, will lead the new global company as Executive Chairman and Director.  Marc Caira, President and CEO of Tim Hortons, will be appointed Vice-Chairman and a Director, focused on overall group strategy and global business development. Daniel Schwartz, CEO of Burger King, will become Group CEO of the new company, with overall day-to-day management and operational accountability. The new company's board will include the current eight Burger King directors and three directors to be appointed by Tim Hortons, including Mr. Caira. Mr. Caira and Mr. Schwartz will continue as Tim Hortons and Burger King CEOs, respectively, through the transition period, and additional executives in the new global company structure will be identified from Burger King and Tim Hortons during the transition period and announced at the time of closing. Both Burger King and Tim Hortons will continue to operate after the closing as standalone, independent brands which leverage global shared services and best practices. The current Tim Hortons headquarters in Oakville, Ontario will continue to be the global home of the Tim Hortons business.  Burger King's current headquarters in Miami, Florida will continue to be the global home of the Burger King business.  It is expected that the shares of the new parent company will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange and the Toronto Stock Exchange.  COMMITMENT TO CANADA As part of its commitment to Canada, the new company will endorse the following principles: Similarly, Burger King will continue to support and preserve its long-standing commitment to local communities and charitable causes in the United States, including the Burger King Scholars Program. Long-term Ownership and Investing in Brands 3G Capital and its principals have a proven track record of investing in and growing iconic brands.  Over the years, it has partnered with other long-term investors in previous transactions to build shareholder value and drive innovation and growth in its companies. 3G Capital will retain all of its investment in Burger King by converting its roughly 70% equity stake in Burger King into equity of the new company. On a pro forma basis, 3G Capital is expected to own approximately 51% of the new company with the balance of the common shares to be held by current public shareholders of Burger King and Tim Hortons. Financial Highlights The combination generates substantial value for shareholders of both companies and provides the opportunity for shareholders to participate in the new company's long-term value creation potential.  In addition to meaningful revenue synergies created from accelerated international growth, the transaction is expected to achieve cost savings through leveraging the new company's global scale and the sharing and implementation of best practices. Structure and Terms Upon completion of the transaction, each outstanding common share of Tim Hortons will be converted into the right to receive C$65.50 in cash and 0.8025 of a common share of the new parent company, which is subject to the right of the holders of Tim Hortons common stock to make elections as noted above. Upon completion of the transaction, each outstanding common share of Burger King will be converted into 0.99 of a share of the parent company and 0.01 of a unit of a newly formed Ontario limited partnership controlled by the new parent company, however, holders of shares of Burger King common stock will be given the right to elect to receive only partnership units in lieu of common shares of the new parent company, subject to a limit on the maximum number of partnership units that can be issued. Shares of the new parent company will be traded on the New York Stock Exchange and the Toronto Stock Exchange and units of the new partnership will be traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The partnership units will be convertible on a 1:1 basis into common shares of the new parent company, however, the units may not be exchanged for common shares for the first year following the closing of the transaction.  Holders of partnership units will participate in the votes of shareholders of the new parent company on a pro-rata basis as though the units had been converted.  3G Capital has committed to elect to receive only partnership units. The transaction is expected to be taxable, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, to the shareholders of Burger King, other than with respect to the partnership units received by them in the transaction. The transaction is expected to be taxable to shareholders of Tim Hortons in the U.S and Canada. Burger King has obtained commitments for $12.5 billion of financing to fund the cash portion of the transaction, including commitments for a $9.5 billion debt financing package led by JP Morgan and Wells Fargo. The obligation of JP Morgan and Wells Fargo to provide this committed debt financing is subject to a number of customary conditions, including execution and delivery of certain definitive documentation. It is expected that the debt financing for the transaction will consist of a $6.75 billion senior secured term loan B facility, a $500 million senior secured revolving credit facility and senior secured second-lien notes in the amount of $2.25 billion. Berkshire Hathaway has committed $3 billion of preferred equity financing. Berkshire is simply a financing source and will not have any participation in the management and operation of the business. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including approval of Tim Hortons shareholders and receipt of certain antitrust and regulatory approvals in Canada and the U.S. Since 3G Capital already owns approximately 70% of the shares of Burger King and has committed to vote in favor of the combination, no shareholder vote is required of Burger King shareholders. Further information regarding the transaction will be included in a joint information circular/statement to be mailed to the shareholders of both Tim Hortons and Burger King.   The Arrangement Agreement and Plan of Merger provides that Tim Hortons is subject to customary non-solicitation provisions. Both companies' boards of directors have unanimously determined that the proposed combination is in the best interests of their respective companies.

NBC New YorkBest Buy's second quarter was good but not great. Earnings came in at $0.44 per share, which was stronger than the $0.31 expected by analysts. However, comparable store sales fell by 2.7%, which was worse than the 2.2% decline expected. Best Buy's online sales jumped by 22% during the period, but it wasn't enough to offset the 0ngoing decline in its stores. "Like other retailers and as reflected in this quarter’s performance, we continued to see a shift in consumer behavior: Consumers are increasingly researching and buying online," CEO Hubert Joly said. "As a result, traffic to our brick-and-mortar stores continued to decline, yet our in-store conversion and online traffic continued to increase due to the execution of our Renew Blue strategy, which is in direct alignment with this shift." Renew Blue is the name for management's comprehensive plan to boost online sales, while also trying to incentivize consumers to come into its stores. Best Buy CFO Sharon McCollam pointed to some other issues hurting sales. "[I]ndustry-wide sales are continuing to decline in many of the consumer electronics categories in which we compete," she said. "We are also seeing ongoing softness in the mobile phone category ahead of highly anticipated new product launches. Therefore, absent any change in these declining industry trends and with limited visibility to new product launch quantities, we continue to expect comparable sales to decline in the low-single digits in both the third and fourth quarters." Best Buy shares are up 3.1% in pre-market trading. FREE AppDownload

REUTERS/Regis DuvignauBritain's Josh Collins riding Spook a Little competes in the team reining competition and first individual qualifying at the World Equestrian Games at the d'Ornano stadium in Caen on Monday.1)  Buffett And Burger King. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett will help finance Burger King's takeover of Tim Hortons, sources are telling The Wall Street Journal. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway will provide 25% of financing in the form of preferred shares, The Journal said.   2)  Onward And Upward With The Stock Market. With the S&amp;P 500 hitting a new all-time high, many are wondering how much higher stocks can go. According to Bloomberg interviews with fund managers, they can yet travel further. “We’re on the expensive side of fair value, but certainly not in the bubble place they were in the 2000 period or in a place that concerns us,” Ed Hyland, an Atlanta-based global investment specialist at JPMorgan Chase Private Bank, told Bloomberg's Lu Wang and Oliver Renick. “There is potential for the market to go higher.” The “market is being rational, responding to improving domestic economic news, extraordinarily low interest rates, easy monetary policy, and limited inflation,” added Howard Ward, chief investment officer for growth equities at Rye, New York-based Gamco Investors Inc. “The market’s valuation level is very defensible.” 3)  Amazon Buys Video Streaming Site For $970 Million. The site, Twitch, allows people to upload footage of themselves playing video games while sometimes providing audio commentary over the footage. In some cases, people host video-game podcasts and shows. The site is also where many e-sports competitions are broadcast live. Twitch accounted for more than 40% of live-streaming traffic by volume in the U.S., according to online video analytics site Qwilt. That made it the No. 1 live-streaming platform by a large margin. 4)  A Big Day For The Economy. At 8:30 a.m. we get durable goods orders for July. Consensus is for an increase of 5.1%. The headline number could be huge, however, because of the historically large number of aircraft orders in July. Then at 10 a.m. we get the Conference Board's consumer confidence index for August. The consensus is for the index to decrease to 89.7 from 90.9. Also at 10 a.m., the Richmond Fed publishes its manufacturing survey for August. 5)  Home Price Indexes. Two on Tuesday, which both hit at 9 a.m. One is the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller House Price Index for June. Although this is the June report, it is really a three-month average of April, May, and June, Bill McBride notes. The consensus is for an 8.4% year-over-year increase in the Composite 20 index (NSA) for June. We also get the FHFA House Price Index for June. Consensus is for a 0.3% increase. 6)  European Banks Offloading Assets. Pressured by regulations and the need to boost margins, Europe's megabanks are looking to spin off noncore assets, something Bloomberg says could be a boon for the region's economy. “Stronger banks will be good for credit in Europe,” Paul Tucker, a former deputy governor of the Bank of England, told Bloomberg's Nicholas Comfort. “Weak banks don’t lend.” 7)  No More Donuts For Kurdish Crude. A federal district judge in Texas threw out an order to seize one million barrels of Kurdish crude from a tanker that, for a short time, was doing "donuts" in the Gulf of Mexico, following protests from the Iraqi government that the shipment was illegal. However, it's not guaranteed that the shipment will now be delivered, as Baghdad could yet attempt another challenge. Meanwhile the other tanker carrying Kurdish crude to the states challenged by Baghdad is returning to Cyprus.  8)  Best Buy Is Sliding. The big-box retailer announced same-store sales were down 2.7% year-over-year, worse than the decline of 2.2% forecast by analysts. Shares were down more than 5% pre-market.  9)  U.S. War On ISIS Expanding. President Barack Obama has authorized U.S. surveillance flights over Syria in preparation for air assaults against ISIS. BI's Michael Kelley says this means the U.S. war against the Islamic militant group is about to grow. "Administration officials told The Guardian that the favored long-term strategy to defeat ISIS is to train moderate Syrian rebels to fight both ISIS and the regime. But the non-jihadist rebels in the Free Syrian Army are now being decimated by both jihadists and the regime after years of being brushed aside as 'former doctors, farmers, pharmacists, and so forth' by Obama." 10)  Markets. Asian indexes were mostly lower. The Nikkei was down 0.6%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng was off 0.4%. In Europe, shares were mostly higher. London's FTSE was up 0.3%, while France's CAC climbed 0.4%. Germany's DAX was flat. Dow futures were up 19 points.  FREE AppDownload
© AFP/File Maxim MarmurA car is driven past a branch of Russian state-owned bank VTB -- then known as Vneshtorgbank -- in Moscow, on September 11, 2006Moscow (AFP) - The Russian government has approved injecting 239 billion rubles ($6.6 billion, 5 billion euros) into two of the country's largest, state-controlled banks that have been hit with Western sanctions. VTB Bank will get the lion's share of the funds, 214 billion rubles, while Rosselkhozbank will get 25 billion, according to a decree signed last week and posted Monday on the government website. Both banks were hit by sanctions imposed over Moscow's support for pro-Russian rebels in Ukraine that deny them most access to borrow on Western financial markets. The banks will issue new preferred shares that will be acquired by Russia's National Welfare Fund, a sovereign wealth fund fed by the country's massive oil revenues worth $86.5 billion at the beginning of August. The borrowing restrictions crimp the ability of Russian banks to lend just as flagging domestic demand has choked off growth and the government wants domestic companies to step up investment to reduce reliance on the West. Russia has banned most EU and US food products in response to Western sanctions, which officials said means the farm sector will need nearly $18 billion in additional investment to produce more of the country's food. The Vedomosti business daily reported Tuesday that the Russian government was considering creating a state reinsurance company, another sector in which the country is highly dependent on foreign companies. It quoted a finance ministry source as saying that creating such a company would require at least $1.5 billion to begin with, while the financial magazine Dengi estimated the sector as needing $10 billion in capital to replace foreign companies. VTB bank said last week its net profit plunged by over four-fifths from the figure for the same period last year to 1.9 billion rubles, but expressed confidence that it can resist Western sanctions.   FREE AppDownload

Getty ImagesShanghai, China.Falling home prices in China have reportedly caused an outburst of anger among property owners. MarketWatch reports owners protesting at the Shanghai sales office of Greentown China Holdings about a 25% cut to prices within a five-day period. The Chinese Government has moved to take the heat out of the property market and limit speculation in a series of measures including property-purchasing limitations, price restrictions, housing tax reforms and loan ceilings. The measures have been working with real estate investment weakening so far this year. However, Greentown China Holdings says there has been a gradual relaxation or withdrawal of restrictive purchase policy in many cities. “The real estate market is gradually rejuvenating itself,” the company says. Housing starts and sales in China both experienced a bad run in the year to May. Consumers had a considerably less positive outlook of property in the most recent Westpac MNI China Consumer Sentiment survey.

Thomson ReutersA pedestrian holding an umbrella to take shelter from rain and hail walks past the Bank of Japan headquarters building in TokyoBy Leika Kihara TOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan is likely to keep its bullish inflation outlook even as it cuts its economic growth forecast this fiscal year in an October report, sources said, suggesting the central bank will not ease policy further for at least the rest of the year. After a hefty 6.8 percent contraction in second-quarter gross domestic product, many private-sector analysts are downgrading their growth forecasts for the year ending in March to around 0.5 percent, just half the 1.0 percent expansion estimated by the BOJ in July. The central bank is seen cutting its GDP estimate for the current fiscal year when it next updates its economic and consumer price forecasts in a semi-annual review on Oct. 31. But any downgrade will be minor and unlikely to greatly affect its bullish projections for inflation to climb near 2 percent next fiscal year, sources familiar with its thinking say. "The basic scenario of a moderate economic recovery pushing up inflation remains in place," one of the sources said on condition of anonymity. The downgrade in its economic estimate would be largely due to the sharp contraction in second-quarter GDP, although many BOJ officials remain optimistic that growth will rebound from the current quarter as the effect of a sales tax hike in April begins to ebb. In a statement to be issued at a rate review next week, the BOJ is likely to say the economy is recovering moderately with the tax-hike impact "gradually beginning to subside," signalling its relief that consumption is holding up even as households feel the pinch from the higher levy, the sources said. That will be a slightly rosier view than the current assessment that the economy is recovering moderately, albeit with some speed bumps caused by the tax hike. BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said earlier this week that consumption is "back to normal levels now" and that he expected a recovery in GDP in July-September. Behind the BOJ's optimism lies a steadily improvement in job and household income conditions. Regular pay rose 0.2 percent in the year to June, marking the first increase in more than two years, and summer bonuses were up 2 percent, easing some of the pain from the higher tax. The BOJ hopes that such increase in wages, driven by a tightening job market, will support household spending and encourage companies to raise prices of goods and services. That, in turn, will allow Japan to meet the BOJ's 2 percent inflation target next fiscal year, central bank officials say. But many central bank policymakers remain concerned about the outlook for exports, a soft spot in the economy that has failed to pick up despite the boost from a weak yen that gives Japanese goods a competitive advantage overseas. Exports rose in July for the first time in three months in a tentative sign that overseas demand is starting to recover, but probably not enough to nudge the BOJ into reviewing its assessment that exports are "weakening," the sources said.

Thomson ReutersWorkers on lifts are pictured near the tail of a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner being built for for Xiamen Airlines in Everett, WashingtonBy Anshuman Daga SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A pick-up in North America's aviation market is providing a boost for the leasing industry as demand from Southeast Asian airlines starts to slow, according to the head of BOC Aviation, Asia's second-biggest aircraft lessor. "Now, what we are particularly seeing is the growth rate has picked up in North America," Robert Martin, chief executive and managing director of the fully-owned leasing subsidiary of Bank of China Ltd , told Reuters in an interview. Speaking after the lessor placed the biggest order in its 20-year history, for 82 Boeing  jets worth $8.8 billion at list prices, Martin said North American carriers are driving demand for newer, fuel-efficient aircraft as they replace ageing planes. "Now that the airlines have consolidated there, they are going to be very profitable," said Martin, an industry veteran of more than 25 years, who has overseen Singapore-based BOC Aviation's rise to become the world's fifth largest lessor by fleet value after joining the company in 1998. Lessors such as BOC Aviation, which place their aircraft with airlines globally, are emerging as important customers for  plane makers. Industry publication Flightglobal estimates the top 50 lessors have a total fleet valued at nearly $200 billion. The global airline industry is forecast to make a profit of $18 billion in 2014, with North America alone making up half of the profit, data from the International Air Transport Association shows. The top four U.S. carriers, all the products of mergers and acquisitions, have put the sector on a sound financial footing. BOC Aviation, formed after Bank of China acquired the Singapore Airlines-backed company in 2006, had an estimated fleet value of $8.9 billion in 2013, according to Flightglobal. Japanese-owned SMBC Aviation Capital is Asia's biggest lessor, with a fleet valued at $9.4 billion. Monday's order by BOC Aviation came weeks after SMBC Aviation placed its own company-record order for 115 Airbus  jets.  SOUTHEAST ASIA OVERCAPACITY Though a booming middle class is set to catapult Asia Pacific past North America as the world's biggest aviation market over the next 20 years, Southeast Asia is showing signs of overcapacity, with airlines such as AirAsia Bhd   deferring orders. "We see some regional differences between the numbers of aircraft they have ordered versus what they need in the short term," said Martin, referring to carriers in Southeast Asia. "It's not a global imbalance. It's purely a regional imbalance that you are seeing at the moment." BOC Aviation's fleet is operated by 56 airlines, including Southwest Airlines , Emirates Airline [EMIRA.UL] and Aeroflot . It has a portfolio of 251 aircraft, with the fleet mainly based on the Airbus A320 family and Boeing Next Generation 737 series. "We are sitting in a situation today where 100 percent of our planes in 2014 are placed, 83 percent for next year are placed and even 50 percent of 2016 is placed," said Martin. In an industry where cost of funding is critical for a lessor's profitability, Martin helped BOC Aviation secure an investment grade credit rating in 2012. The lessor has tapped into different types of financing, including the first offshore renminbi-denominated bonds by an aircraft lessor. This has helped it take on competition from the biggest lessors, GECAS, a unit of General Electric, and International Lease Finance Corp, now part of AerCap . Ilya Ivashkov, a New York-based senior director at Fitch Ratings, said being part of Bank of China had helped BOC Aviation tap into various funding sources, giving the lessor an edge over some other players.Chinese banks such as Industrial and Commercial Bank of China  and China Development Bank have also emerged as significant global players with their fast-growing leasing subsidiaries. Dinesh Keskar, Boeing's vice president for sales at Asia Pacific and India said airlines in India, Indonesia and China are increasingly tapping lessors to operate modern fleets, instead of making capex-heavy plane purchases. The introduction of more economic reforms in some of Asia's biggest economies will ultimately boost travel growth in the region, Martin said. "Now particularly with three reform-minded leaders in place in the three biggest countries in the region - in Indonesia, China and India, we are going to see further stimulation to traffic growth," he said, adding that growth in intra-Asia trade will drive demand for business travel and also boost tourism."

Thomson ReutersThe oil tanker United Kalavyrta approaches Galveston, TexasHOUSTON (Reuters) - A U.S. court on Monday threw out an order to seize some 1 million barrels of disputed Iraqi Kurdish crude oil from a tanker, a move that could allow the cargo to be delivered in Texas and end a nearly month-long impasse. The United Kalavrvta tanker, carrying about $100 million worth of Kurdish crude, has been anchored near Texas for weeks, as the Iraqi region of Kurdistan wages a legal battle over ownership with the central government of Iraq.

Thomson ReutersA vendor cuts chicken feet from slaughtered chickens at a market in ChangzhiSHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese police have seized over 30,000 tonnes of tainted chicken feet, common on restaurant menus in China, in the latest food scandal to hit the country. Authorities have detained 38 people involved in the sale of the chicken feet in provinces including the eastern province of Zhejiang, the official Xinhua news agency reported on Tuesday. The arrests followed raids on nine supplier factories in nearby Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan and Guangdong provinces, Xinhua said, adding police found that excess hydrogen peroxide was being added to the meat. China has been rocked by a number of high-profile food scandals from milk powder tainted with industrial chemical melamine to re-used "gutter oil" for cooking. Earlier this month, U.S. ketchup maker H.J. Heinz Co [HJHC.UL] apologized to Chinese consumers as it recalled some infant cereal due to excess levels of lead. Last month, McDonald's Corp  and KFC-parent Yum Brands Inc  were caught up in a scandal after it was found that workers at a China-based supplier had used expired meat and doctored food production dates. Zhejiang police had broken up 35 sales networks for the tainted chicken feet, valued at over 300 million yuan ($48.76 million), local police said in a microblog post. Eleven suspects were still on the run, the police said. Chicken feet are a popular dish in China where they are often broiled or put in soups. China was the largest buyer of chicken feet exported from the United States last year. In 2013, Xinhua reported that China had seized 20 tonnes of chicken feet, some of which had production dates on their packaging going back as far as 1967. Chinese authorities also said on Monday that a local chef had gone on trial accused of painting abalones and goose feet to make the dishes visually more appealing, Xinhua said.

Thomson ReutersGerman Chancellor Merkel sits in an All New Jetta as she visits the FAW-Volkswagen production plant, in ChengduSHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's corruption watchdog said on Tuesday it is investigating one former and one current executive at Volkswagen AG's &lt;VOWG_p.DE&gt; Chinese venture, FAW-Volkswagen Automotive Co Ltd, for "seriously violating the law." The announcement, posted on website of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China, identified the two as former deputy general manager Li Wu and Zhou Chun, deputy general manager of the joint venture's Audi sales division. Officials at Volkswagen in China, FAW and FAW-Volkswagen could not be reached for comment. Efforts to reach Li and Zhou for comment were unsuccessful. The statement said the investigation comes after the watchdog recently launched a special inspection at FAW Group Corp. The joint venture with state-owned FAW is one of the two car-making ventures the German automaker has in China. Volkswagen's luxury brand Audi and other foreign brands like Daimler AG's &lt;DAIGn.DE&gt; Mercedes-Benz and Fiat SpA's &lt;FIA.MI&gt; Chrysler have been under investigation in China over their pricing practices as Beijing steps up enforcement of its anti-monopoly laws. Earlier this month the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), China's price regulator, said it would punish Audi and Chrysler for monopoly practices. It was not immediately clear if the two probes were related.              (Reporting by Samuel Shen and Kazunori Takada; Editing by Matt Driskill) FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersJaguar Land Rover (JLR) Chief Executive Officer Ralf Speth looks on during a news conference to announce Tata Motors' third quarter results in MumbaiBy Aditi Shah NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's pricing regulator has fined more than a dozen global and local carmakers a total of 25.5 billion rupees ($420 million) after a probe found they had engaged in anti-competitive practices in the world's sixth largest auto market. The Indian penalty follows heightened regulatory scrutiny of the auto industry in China, the world's largest auto market. Several global car and spare parts makers have been fined, or are being investigated, by China's anti-monopoly regulator, the National Development and Reform Commission. The Competition Commission of India (CCI) said in a statement it had fined the 14 automakers after its investigation showed they were restricting access to spare parts, which in turn made them more expensive for consumers. It listed the automakers fined as the local unit of Honda Motor Co , Toyota Motor Co , Volkswagen AG  and its unit Skoda Auto, BMW AG , Daimler AG's Mercedes-Benz , Fiat SpA , Ford Motor Co , General Motors Co  and Nissan Motor Co . Local carmaker Tata Motors Ltd  was handed the highest penalty of 13.46 billion rupees. The other Indian carmakers fined were Maruti Suzuki Ltd , Hindustan Motors Ltd  and Mahindra &amp; Mahindra Ltd . The fine, equivalent to two percent of the carmakers' three-year average India revenue, is payable within 60 days, the regulator said. "The anti-competitive conduct... has restricted the expansion of spare parts and independent repairers segment of the economy to its full potential, at the cost of the consumers, service providers and dealers," it said in the statement. In a statement, Ford's India unit said it was reviewing the order and its implications, adding that the company had been working to enhance the availability of parts. A Tata Motors spokeswoman also said the company would study the CCI order before making any comment. Mahindra &amp; Mahindra said it planned to appeal the watchdog's order.  A Honda executive in India was not available for a comment, while a Maruti spokesman declined to comment. The India representatives of the other carmakers did not immediately respond to request for comment. The CCI said it had launched its investigation in 2011 after receiving information that spare parts made by some companies in India were not freely available in the market, resulting in higher prices for the parts and repair and maintenance services. It said it had asked the carmakers to rectify their anti-competitive behavior, which it said impacted 20 million customers.   (Editing by Sumeet Chatterjee and Miral Fahmy) FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Nicky LohTOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's government turned slightly more cautious about factory output and flagged a risk that April's sales-tax hike could have prolonged effects, a sign that the world's third-biggest economy is struggling with the higher tax and further stimulus might be warranted. In its monthly report issued on Tuesday, the government stuck to its overall view of the economy, which it had raised in July. The new report said that a moderate recovery trend is intact, adding that there has been an easing from the pullback in demand that followed the sales-tax hike. Previous monthly reports described industrial output as weakening "recently", following a boost in demand before the sales tax rose to 8 percent from 5 percent. In the latest report, the government dropped "recently" to sound more cautious about factory output. Despite that wording tweak, the government left its assessment on industrial output unchanged from July. "The economy is expected to recover moderately as effects of the sales tax hike ease gradually," said an official of the Cabinet Office, which compiled the monthly report for August. He added that improvement in the labor market and household income are expected to support private consumption from now on. Still, the government flagged the risk of a prolonged impact of the tax hike, as well as weaker overseas economies, hurting the Japanese economy in future. If weakness in the economy persists, that would threaten the Bank of Japan's inflation goal and could put pressure on the government and the BOJ to take fresh action to sustain growth. The central bank sees the economy in a moderate recovery trend, while describing output as showing some weakness lately. Industrial output slid 3.4 percent in June, the biggest month-on-month decline since the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami. Production is expected to rise just 1.0 percent in July, according to a Reuters poll, as manufacturers face a pile of inventory and falling shipments.[ID:nL4N0QR1BT] Industrial production data for July is due on Friday. Analysts expect Japan's economy will grow at an annualized rate of around 4 percent in the current quarter after the tax hike led to a 6.8 percent economic contraction in April-June.   (Reporting by Tetsushi Kajimoto; Editing by Richard Borsuk) FREE AppDownload

© AFP Fabrice CoffriniThe headquarters of the Swiss private Bank Pictet on August 25, 2014 in GenevaGeneva (AFP) - The elite of Swiss private banks will Tuesday begin lifting the veil on their books after a radical shift in their business model, amid tougher international regulations and crackdowns on tax dodgers. Geneva's Bank Pictet opens the way with an unprecedented release of its first-half results, followed on Thursday by crosstown rival Lombard Odier. "All the figures published will be important, even if these banks are not listed," Andreas Venditti, an analyst at Zurich's Vontobel Bank, told AFP. The revolution in the secretive world of private banking — which caters for the globe's super-wealthy — began in January when Pictet and Lombard Odier ditched their two-century-old statutes. Under the former rules, a private bank's handful of wealthy managing partners were personally responsible for the money they managed for their clients. In other words, if the bank got into trouble, the partners could lose all their assets, not just those they have invested in the operation. Unlimited responsibility has long been a selling point for wealthy clients who sought the comfort of such a guarantee. But the increasingly complex nature of global finance has made it hard for private bankers to feel safe with a traditional approach that puts all their assets on the line as they expand their operations. The tougher regulatory environment seen since the global financial crisis, and scandals such as the Madoff fraud case in the United States which rippled across the world's banking sector, were also a wake-up call. Switzerland's cherished tradition of banking secrecy has meanwhile been battered as governments -- notably the United States and European Union -- crack down on tax cheats who stash cash abroad. As a result, a quartet of private banks have shifted from their near-unique status and transformed themselves into businesses almost like any other. They have recast themselves a "corporate partnership", a hybrid status that will make it easier to compare them with fully-listed Swiss players such as Credit Suisse and UBS. It is similar to the "limited company" structure in the British Isles, with its well-known "Ltd." label. The partners now only risk the funds they have invested in the bank, rather than putting all their personal assets on the line. Not being listed on the stock exchange, private banks do not have to publish as detailed results as mainstream banks. They are set to reveal their overall performance, plus their half-year profit or loss, the value of assets under management, the ratio of own funds, and their short-term liquidities. They have no obligation to reveal the salaries of their executives. For Luc Thevenoz, a law professor at the University of Geneva, the changed business model offers greater protection. "But the price of that is more transparency," he said. Old habits appeared to have died hard in some private banks, however. While Pictet and Lombard Odier revealed when they would publish their figures, fellow statute-changers Mirabaud and LaRoche declined to set a date when contacted by AFP. Seven lower-profile private banks have meanwhile opted to stick to their traditional operating model. FREE AppDownload
