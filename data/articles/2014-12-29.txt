Thomson ReutersThe sign outside the Target store in ArvadaBy Deepa Seetharaman SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Major U.S. retailers including Target Corp and Toys 'R Us have begun allowing shoppers to collect online purchases at their brick-and-mortar stores, but a study shows the option often saves little, if any, time over in-store shopping. According to a small study to be released on Tuesday by retail-intelligence firm StellaService, in-store pickup saved shoppers just 96 seconds on average compared with searching for items on their own. In a few cases, in-store pickup took longer. In-store pickup is one of many services being tested as retailers try to use their stores as mini-shipping hubs to get items to shoppers more quickly. It comes in response to competition from the No. 1 U.S. online retailer, Amazon.com Inc, which has streamlined its delivery service. The StellaService study, based on 44 visits to stores in the South run by 11 retailers, is one of the most comprehensive studies so far of the in-store pickup service. The results show that retailers have no uniform approach to the issue. "It's amazing just how much simpler the process would have been if someone had just put up a sign," said Ty McMahan, senior director of content for StellaService, adding that retailers are spending "tens of millions of dollars" on these initiatives. Shoppers spent an average of 5 minutes and 24 seconds in a store when trying to pick up their online orders. Those who did not use the in-store pickup feature spent an average of 7 minutes in the store, according to the study. But in-store pickup saved just 30 seconds at Target and Toys 'R Us. At Macy's Inc, StellaService shoppers were not quite sure where to go. In-store pickup took 8 minutes and 30 seconds, while those who walked in spent 5 minutes at a Macy's store. By contrast, in-store pickup took only 2 minutes at Office Depot Inc, compared with 4 minutes for those who walked in. Home Depot Inc and Nordstrom Inc were the only other retailers that were slower at in-store pickup. Macy's and Home Depot could not be immediately reached for comment. Nordstrom said one of the reasons they offer in-store pickup for online items is to guarantee customers that it will be there for them if they make a visit to the store. "We are always looking at ways to improve the service for our customers," Nordstrom spokeswoman Brooke White said.

Gluskin Sheff's David Rosenberg described himself as "the poster boy for the bull market" in a note to clients on Monday. “The US economy does not seem to need either the housing market (or the export sector for that matter) when practically every other engine is humming along and driving growth to its best performance in 11 years – funny enough, 2003, like now, was the breakout year following a horrible recession, deflation scare, terrorist attack, war and jobless recovery," he wrote.

There are a bunch of ways to drill for oil.  You can drill it in your backyard if you're in the right spot, or you can go just offshore and drill it from the ocean. You can also frack for it or extract oil from tar sands.  But whichever way you choose to procure your oil, the costs are going to be different.  On Monday, the price of West Texas Intermediate oil — the US benchmark price — traded below $53 a barrel for the first time since May 2009, bringing WTI's decline to nearly 50% from its June highs. And as the price of oil has declined, many have asked what the "breakeven" price is for various oil projects around the world.  In a post last week, Rabah Arezki and Olivier Blanchard of the IMF broke down some of the questions hovering over the oil price slump. Arezki and Blanchard also included this chart, which shows the cost curve — or how much it costs to keep a project going — not grouping the projects by location but by how they drill.  Onshore drilling is the cheapest, benefiting many Middle East suppliers, while fracking and oil sands are most expensive, pressuring US and Canadian producers.

Russia's Problems Are A Huge Warning Sign About Emerging Markets (Morningstar)  Russia's seen a volatile December: hiked interest rates, increased inflation, and a plunging ruble. Morningstar's Karin Anderson suggests that Russia's problems reflect the larger risks associated with emerging markets. "Emerging markets' fundamentals can change fairly quickly with changes in political regimes, commodities pricing, or geopolitical risk. Second, currency fluctuations can have a quick and pronounced impact on investors' assessment of the risks and valuations of emerging-markets bonds," writes Anderson. "Because of those risks, Russia is a reminder that emerging markets remain subject to swift and meaningful changes in capital flows," Anderson adds. F-Squared Paid $35 Million In A Settlement (The Wall Street Journal)  "F-Squared Investments Inc., which builds investment portfolios out of exchange-traded funds, admitted it misled clients about its track record and agreed to pay $35 million in a settlement with regulators," reports Corrie Driebusch. The SEC filed separate civil charges against the former CEO. He stepped down from his position last month, but his lawyers maintain that the SEC's allegations "are misdirected and meritless." Analysts Aren't Feeling Great About Commodities In 2015 (Think Advisor) Thanks in part to the strong US dollar, commodities have seen a tough year. And analysts don't think that things will get any better in the next one. A recent Bloomberg survey sees Brent sliding to $50 a barrel, and Goldman Sachs analysts "see further declines in prices for oil and for other commodities with anticipated strengthening of the US dollar in 2015 and weaker demand for commodities in China," reports Janet Levaux. Additionally, analysts have mixed feelings about agri-commodities in the next year.

Brussels (AFP) - Fears of a Greek euro exit have returned with a bang after Athens called early elections on Monday, but steps taken after the financial crisis should stop the rest of the currency zone imploding, analysts say. The bigger issue is of political contagion across the EU, with anti-austerity parties across the continent likely to be boosted if Greece's radical left Syriza party wins the January 25 polls, they said. Brussels and Berlin reacted with alarm after lawmakers failed for a third time to choose a new president and triggered snap elections, with both urging Greek voters to back reforms demanded by international creditors. "This is the worst case scenario", Jan Techau, director of the Carnegie Europe think-tank based in Brussels, told AFP.  "The uncertainty is a stark reminder the crisis is not over." Greece's debt led the eurozone to the brink of collapse in 2012, with the European Union, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund coughing up two huge bailouts to avoid Greek exit from the currency, the so-called 'Grexit'. But Techau stressed it was a "big if" that Syriza would end up replacing Prime Minister Antonis Samaras's centre-right coalition, with Greeks having steered clear so far of radical parties. Even if Syriza does win, the party's charismatic leader Alexis Tsipras may not carry out his threat to renege on key parts of Greece's bailout agreement with the EU and IMF, analysts said. "The ultra-left Syriza has moderated its tones slightly" Holger Schmieding of Berenberg Bank said. Nonetheless, Schmieding said there was "a risk of around 30 percent that Greece may descend into a new deep crisis with potential euro exit beyond the inevitable bout of near-term uncertainty now." What had changed since 2012, analysts said, was the risk that a Greek exit would spread to the rest of the eurozone -- the single currency bloc that will number 19 countries when Lithuania joins on January 1. The EU has set up a huge 500 billion firewall to prevent a repeat of the debt crisis, while European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi calmed the storm in 2012 by promising to do "whatever it takes" to save the euro. The relative strength of Spain and Ireland compared to two years ago was also a positive factor. "A tragedy for Greece would probably not turn into a systemic crisis for the eurozone as a whole," Schmieding said. Jacques Cailloux of Nomura Securities agreed. "We're no longer in the same situation as before because the ECB has contained the contagion effects for two years," Cailloux told AFP. But the risk of political contagion across Europe is another matter. Left-wing parties such as Spain's Podemos have made huge gains in a relatively short time and see Syriza as a model for challenging harsh austerity diktats from Brussels and Washington.  Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias exchanged celebratory tweets with Tsipras after Monday's result, predicting that "2015 will be the year of change in Spain and in Europe." Opinion polls put Podemos in the lead in the runup to legislative elections in Spain in November. At the other end of the political spectrum, right-leaning eurosceptic parties such as Nigel Farage's UK Independence Party are also riding high on widespread disillusionment with Brussels. "A win for Syriza could boost the popularity of other anti-austerity parties in the eurozone as long as the economic situation in Greece does not descend into chaos following the emergence of the new government," said Diego Iscaro, an analyst with IHS Global Insight. A Greek exit could meanwhile cause broader geopolitical problems. There was a risk that if Europe fails to act then Athens could be bailed out by China or even Russia, both of which have a "huge geopolitical interest in gaining influence", said Techau, the Carnegie Europe director.  "We don't want that country under the influence of an outside power," Techau said, adding Greece could be under pressure to veto EU decisions on sanctions on or trade with other countries. The European Union has imposed a series of economic and other sanctions against Russia over the crisis in Ukraine.   FREE AppDownload

IMDB / MGMTeen WolfSo here's the latest in wild internet rumors. Everyone thinks that the President of Argentina Christina Fernández de Kirchner adopted a young Jewish man in order to stop him from turning into a werewolf. The story was reported by The Independent and others. Well, the story's kind of true — Fernández de Kirchner did adopt the young man as her godson — but not to keep him from turning into a werewolf. There's an old Argentinian legend that a seventh child will turn into "el lobizon" — aka a werewolf — after his 13th birthday, and then terrorize the Argentinian countryside at night whenever there's a full moon, as reported by the Independent. In the 19th century, parents were reportedly so spooked by "el lobizon" that they started abandoning and murdering their 7th children. Around the same time, in the early 20th century, another tradition involving a seventh child came to be. Argentinian presidents started adopting the seventh child born in a family as godchildren. Mágico fue recibir a Iair Tawil, 1er ahijado presidencial de nuestra historia que profesa la fe judía. pic.twitter.com/18eNPR5kXv   Yo no lo sabía, pero su visita coincidía con la celebración de Hanukkah. El papá, decía que no era una casualidad… pic.twitter.com/o3y5E17Gew Over the last few days, sources have been reporting that this Argentinian custom was adopted as a response to the murder and abandonment of these "el lobizon" children. However, others like the Guardian are debunking this. Reportedly, the godchild custom goes back all the way to 1907 when Russian emigrés asked the then-president José Figueroa Alcorta to become the godfather to their seventh son, reports the Guardian. "The local myth of the lobizón is not in any way connected to the custom that began over 100 years ago by which every seventh son (or seventh daughter) born in Argentina becomes godchild to the president," Argentine historian Daniel Balmaceda told The Guardian. So what exactly what special about Iair Tawil's case? Traditionally, the seventh son or daughter could only become a godchild of the Argentinian president if he or she was Christian. But Tawil was the first Jewish young man to do so — making it a tweet-worthy affair.  Fernández has become the president godmother to roughly 700 children since she took office in 2007, reports The Guardian. No word on how many children she has saved from becoming werewolves. FREE AppDownload
Target's business is on fire.  The discount retailer's shares rose an impressive 19% this year. Recent sales results have also topped Wall Street's estimates. Target made several important decisions to turn around business, according to Brian Yarbrough, consumer analyst at Edward Jones. Yarbrough told Business Insider how the company was able to get customers back in stores. Target CEO Gregg Steinhafel resigned after a tumultuous reign that included the company's massive data breach and botched Canadian expansion.  He was replaced by PepsiCo veteran Brian Cornell.  Since taking the helm in September, Cornell has successfully implemented a strategy that takes Target back to its roots.  "Bringing in the new CEO was the first step for Target," Yarbrough said. "He has a creative new perspective and isn't afraid to take risks."  In recent years, Target made the mistake of pushing consumer staples like toilet paper and laundry detergent. "You aren't going to beat Wal-Mart and Amazon in those categories," Yarbrough said. "People don't go to Target for cheap food." Under Cornell's leadership, Target has started focusing on "cheap chic" home decor and apparel.  This strategy is more likely to attract Target's demographic, according to Yarbrough.  Target has struggled to gain traction in Canada. But that could change under Cornell, according to Yarbrough. "Target Canada's future can only get better," Yarbrough said.  The company will either close underperforming stores, or implement a new strategy to drive profits.  FREE AppDownload

Shake Shack on InstagramThe major stock indexes went nowhere on Monday as the markets are still quiet between last week's Christmas holiday and this week's New Year's holiday that will again see US markets close on Thursday. But despite little change in the averages, by virtue of a positive close the S&amp;P 500 made another all-time high.  First, the scoreboard: And now, the top stories on Monday: 1. Oil crashed again. On Monday, West Texas Intermediate crude oil fell briefly below $53 a barrel, the lowest since May 2009. WTI crude was near $105 a barrel in June, and has now lost almost 50% of its value. Also in oil news, the number of US oil and gas rigs in operation fell again, declining by 35 last week according to the latest data from oil driller Baker Hughes. With this decline, the number of US oil and gas rigs in operation is down to 1,840 from 1,920 earlier this month.  2. The latest manufacturing report from the Dallas Federal Reserve missed expectations, with the report's composite index coming in at 4.1 against expectations for a reading of 9. This was also lower than November's 10.5 reading. The report showed that business leaders in Texas across a range of industries are concerned about the declining price of oil, with one executive in the metal products manufacturing sector telling the Dallas Fed the drop in oil prices was "going to make thing ugly ... quickly." 3. The Russian ruble collapsed again, falling 9% against the US dollar on Monday alone. One dollar currently buys you around 58.5 rubles, and at the start of the day Monday, one dollar was worth around 53.5 rubles. This latest leg lower in the currency, which has been one of the worst performing currencies in the world this year, follows an announcement from Russia's Economy Ministry that GDP contracted 0.5% from a year earlier.  4. The Greek stock market had a wild day, falling as much as 11% before closing down around 4% after the final round of parliamentary presidential elections failed to pick a winner. For the third time this month, Greece's parliament failed to secure 180 votes in favor of any one presidential candidate, forcing a snap election which will be held in January. Business Insider's Mike Bird has the full breakdown here.  5. Burger chain Shake Shack formally filed for its IPO, revealing that for the first nine months of this year revenue totaled $83.8 million on same-shack-sales that are up 3% year-to-date. Shake Shack also earned $5.4 million in net income in 2013, as revenue has growth from just $19.5 million in 2010 and the number of locations has risen from 7 to 63 over that period. To see Shake Shack's growth, these are the two charts to note.  Don't Miss: David Tepper Thinks 2015 Will Be A Good Year For Stocks » FREE AppDownload

Bloomberg TVDavid TepperDavid Tepper thinks 2015 is going to be a good year. In an interivew with CNBC's Melissa Lee, Tepper said the stock market is "fairly valued," but expects that stocks could rise another 8%-10% in 2015.  Lee asked Tepper how he was positioned against his 70%-80% long positioning from earlier this spring, and Tepper simply responded: "Longer." Tepper added that, "It's not the time to be careful now. Enjoy the ride." So Tepper is bullish going into next year and it seems he has positioned his portfolio accordingly.  Back in May at the SALT Conference, Tepper made headlines when he said that it was "nervous time" in the market. At SALT, Tepper said that it wasn't time to be short, but warned that investors shouldn't be "too frickin' long."  A month later, Tepper said he wasn't nervous anymore.  Tepper also told Lee that he is up on the year and up for the month of December, but that his Appaloosa Management hedge fund, which has about $20 billion in assets under management, has trailed the S&amp;P 500 this year.  Last week in an email to CNBC, Tepper said that he worries 2015 could be a repeat of 1999, citing the collapse in the ruble and the prospect of easier monetary policy from Europe.

REUTERS/Sergei KarpukhinThe ruble is collapsing. The currency dropped by as much as 9.3% against the US dollar on Monday — the biggest decline since December 15. Curently, $1 gets you around 58.54 rubles. It opened for trading to day at 53.49. This crash follows the Economy Ministry's announcement that GDP contracted by 0.5% from a year earlier, following a 0.5% increase in October. "This is linked to sanctions first of all, oil and the panic we saw on the market in December. The damage to the banking system and consumer sentiment will take a long time to repair," Dmitriy Polevoy, the chief economist for Russia and the CIS at ING Bank of Moscow, told the Moscow Times. Additionally, oil prices have crashed again on Monday. The price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil plunged to as low as $52.90 per barrel, a 4% decline, and Brent crude oil fell to its lowest price since May 2009 — falling as low as $57.37 per barrel. BloombergRuble to USD, 1 day. Right now, Russia is on the edge of its first recession since 2009. Its economy took a serious beating following the sanctions imposed by the EU and US over the situation in Ukraine and the plunging oil prices. Following the sharpest fall in Russia's HSBC composite output index since May — down to 47.6 in November from 49.1 in October — analysts began expressing pessimistic views about the state of the economy. "The PMI survey found the Russian economy risking not only prolonged, but deep recession. We expect 1.5% GDP decline in 2015, but are prepared to see even deeper decline if current negative trends by the PMI survey continue," writes Alexander Morozov, the Chief Economist of Russia, CIS and the Baltics at HSBC.

When turmoil hits the Middle East, one of the first questions everyone asks is: "How much oil is at risk?" News outlets and energy pundits were quick to attribute recent oil price volatility to Libya, where a rocket attack led to major oil storage tank fires. Turmoil in the region could lead to a disruption in oil supply. Because Libya is known to be a big player in the oil markets, this was a decent rationale. But how big a player is Libya really? It's about 1% of total global oil production. In JP Morgan Funds' monthly guide to the markets, David Kelly and his team offer this map showing what percentage of the world's liquid energy is produced by each country or flows through a waterway in the Middle East. The countries in the Middle East are sitting on oceans of oil and gas. So, whenever there's any news about escalating tension or turmoil in the Middle East, we can't help but wonder how much energy is exposed to disruption. This map helps to answer those questions.

Pool/Getty ImagesThe number of US oil rigs in operation keeps tumbling. The latest Baker Hughes rig count data showed that the total number of US rigs in operation — which includes both oil and gas rigs — fell by 35 last week, to 1,840 from 1,875. This report is usually released on Friday afternoons, but was released on Monday due to last week's Christmas holiday. This is down from 1,920 for the week ended December 5. Oil rigs in use fell by 37 last week, while gas rigs actually rose by 2.  For the week ending December 12, the number of oil rigs in use fell by 27, which at that time was the single biggest weekly decline in two years. The following week, the number of rigs in use fell by 18. The drop in oil rigs on Monday also comes alongside two discouraging pieces of news for the oil industry. The price of West Texas Intermediate oil is crashing again, touching $53 a barrel for the first time since May 2009 and declining more than 3% on the day.  Additionally, manufacturing data from the Dallas Fed showed that business leaders in Texas are growing concerned about the drop in the price of oil. As one Texas business executive said, the drop in crude oil prices was, "going to make things ugly ... quickly." And according to Monday's report, Texas saw 16 rigs shut down last week.  In Canada, the number of rigs in use also continues to crater, which rigs in use falling by a staggering 135 last week to 256, which is below the same point a year ago. Canada's production, however, is more seasonal than the US. Here is the chart for US rig use, which now shows a noticeable drawdown over the last month, even on a 14-year time scale.

Crashing oil prices are bad news for energy-driven economies like Saudi Arabia, Russia and Nigeria, which rely on revenues to fund government spending. In recent years, all anyone's ever talked about in the US is the shale boom, sparked by developments in hydraulic fracturing technology. The boom has been an important source of new jobs and business spending for the economy. And investors in the industry have certainly made a lot of money. With low oil prices making a lot of these shale drilling projects unprofitable, investors have been left wondering just how exposed the US economy and its financial markets really are. While the US energy industry is indeed big, it's actually relatively small compared to all of the other huge industries that make up the US economy and markets. Goldman Sachs' Alec Phillips and Kris Dawsey offer some context in a note circulated to clients late Friday. They emphasized that energy is more broadly represented in the public financial markets than in the economy as a whole. Here are some stats about the US energy industry: Indeed, investors in energy junk bonds and junk bond indexes have felt a lot of pain. But those with broadly diversified portfolios are really feeling much of a pinch. Energy has been an increasingly important component of the US investment spending, or capital expenditure (capex) story. While that theme certainly has its cracks, economists agree that the benefits of cheap energy to the consumer overwhelmingly offsets this downside. "Consumer spending represents 68% of the US economy," Charles Schwab's Liz Ann Sonders said earlier this month. "Oil and gas capex represents about 1% of US GDP and less than 9% of US total capex (which in turn represents about 12% of US GDP). Therefore, the benefit of lower energy prices to the consumer and many businesses greatly outweighs the significant hit to energy companies and/or energy-oriented capex, especially in energy-oriented states." "The upshot is that oil producers are over-represented in publicly traded markets, and oil consumers are under-represented," Phillips and Dawsey write. Phillips and Dawsey estimate current oil prices will offer a net boost of 0.4 to 0.5 percent points of growth to 2015 GDP. Goldman Sachs FREE AppDownload

Oil affects countries around the world differently. Generally speaking, low prices are great for net importers of oil, but bad for net exporters. UBS's macro strategy team considered what a permanent $10 drop in a barrel of Brent crude would mean. "Oil-producing economies such as Russia and Norway and OPEC clearly lose out when oil prices fall, with the former seeing an impairment of its GDP of over 1 percentage point," UBS analysts wrote on Thursday. "Among large developed economies, the US and Japan are least affected. Although Japan has a relatively high dependency on imported oil the weight of energy products in its consumer price basket is quite low compared with other developed economies. That means the real income-related benefits for Japan's consumers from weaker oil prices are relatively low compared with elsewhere." For the US, the energy dependency and sensitivity story has been evolving rapidly as more and more oil has been fracked out of America's shale basins. "Prior to the shale revolution model simulations would have suggested a boost of 0.2 to 0.3 percentage points to US growth for every USD 10/bbl decrease in the price of oil," they write. "That estimate is now only 0.1%." Overall, they estimate that a sustained $10 drop in prices will add about 0.2 percentage points to global GDP. From UBS: UBS
The death of the dollar – as much as some folks were ready for it – didn’t occur in 2014. OK, there are a few days left, but you get the idea. Instead, the dollar has been hot. It rose against a large number of currencies. Some of them, such as the Russian ruble, have plunged for reasons of their own and have engendered desperate efforts to stem the decline. Other countries, like Japan, have gone all out to demolish their currencies. Escalating the currency war is frowned upon. So Japan found more acceptable names for it and redoubled its efforts. And the ECB has been passionately talking down the euro, but has done relatively little by central-bank standards to actually water it down. Central banks tried to dominate the currency markets, but currency markets are an unruly crowd that can’t be easily cowed. In sovereign bond markets, central banks rule with an iron fist by imposing zero or even negative rates and buying up sovereign bonds, or promising to do so, with money of which they can create an unlimited amount. These “bold actions” inflated valuations and pushed down yields to grotesque levels, such as the crappy 10-year Japanese Government Bond yielding 0.32%. That kind of control eludes central banks in the currency markets. They’re doing a superb job devaluing a currency, but bringing it back up after it begins to spiral out of control is hard. It requires resources that a central bank can’t print. It requires interest rates so high that they might strangle the economy. It requires other expensive, painful, or even impossible measures. And so more often than not, that noble fiat currency just goes to heck. We’ve seen plenty of it in 2014. In this environment, how fast and how far will the dollar continue to rise in 2015? “Whenever a consensus is so unanimous, our gut tells us it is wrong,” BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world, explained in its 2015 Investment Outlook. “Stretched positioning means even a mild disappointment to dollar bulls could prompt a sell-off in the currency.” That “consensus” that the dollar will strengthen is based on the end of the Fed’s QE, shrinking trade deficits due to rising oil production in the US and dropping oil imports. The consensus also relies on more demand for dollars as the Fed is threatening to raise interest rates in 2015, at a time when the Bank of Japan is madly printing money and pushing yields to new lows; and when the ECB is promising outright purchases of sovereign bonds on a massive scale. And true, BlackRock says, that increasing rate differential is going to create demand for dollar assets. But that “bullish dollar view is reflected in futures markets positioning. Trades against the euro look especially crowded, with short positioning almost three standard deviations from the mean.” Then there’s the “malign path” to a higher dollar: a global economic slowdown that would trigger “safe-haven buying.” Either way, the consequences of a higher dollar can be brutal in the Emerging Markets, where the hot money gathers. As dollar assets in the US become more attractive and as rates rise, that hot money simply evaporates from the Emerging Markets, and “funding sources dry up.” This triggers a chain reaction. To prevent its currency from going to heck, the central bank ends up selling its foreign exchange reserves and buying the local currency. This “tightens domestic financial conditions,” just when the ballooning issuance of US-dollar corporate debt in EM countries to lock in lower interest rates – see Russia – has created “pockets of vulnerability.” To attract liquidity, EM countries raise rates. But these rates trigger “slowdowns and currency gyrations.” Major crises have been the result. And speculators can muck up the scenario: short-term fluctuations in currencies are often the result of “flows and investor sentiment – which both can turn on a rupee.” But is the dollar rise a sure thing? BlackRock hedges its bets: “Forecasting currency movements has created many orphans.” The problem: these stubborn currencies don’t always play along. Turns out over periods of five years or more, currencies tend to behave in line with fundamentals, such as interest rate differentials and various central bank machinations. But not in the short or medium term. “Getting the direction right is one thing; getting the timing right is another,” BlackRock says. Appreciation cycles in the trade-weighted US dollar tend to last about six to seven years. But here is the problem: “Expect air pockets along the way.” The Fed has engineered the long-term destruction of the dollar that exceeds even that of the currencies in the US Dollar Index, as the chart going back to 1973 shows. But there have been two periods when the dollar soared for years (shaded areas). BlackRock supposes that we’re now in the third such period (shaded area on the right). But mind the “air pockets.” For example, from August 1998 to October 1999, in the middle of the last appreciation cycle, the dollar fell 7% against the currencies in the index: Wolf Street So the stronger dollar might remain elusive in 2015. There are reasons beyond the fact that the trade is too crowded. BlackRock cites the “Pavlovian tendencies” of the markets that have been “conditioned to wait for monetary policy to dictate market moves.” They might hold their fire until the Fed gives the go-ahead. In this case, “the US dollar will only take off when Fed Chair Janet Yellen fires off her first rate hike.” That might not happen. Instead, the Fed might refuse to raise rates because of “growth disappointment (it has happened before).” And then, there is “an even worse scenario for dollar bulls: US economic momentum stalls, leading to expectations for a fourth round of QE.” That might cause the dollar to return to its norm and sag once again. As the above chart shows, it’s unrewarding to be a dollar bull long-term. The dollar has been slated for destruction, but the Fed wants to accomplish this over many years, rather than all at once. And only occasionally do things get out of hand, and the dollar rallies for a few years – enough to infuse a lot of false confidence. On the surface, BlackRock is in a bullish mood and is gung-ho about the US economy. Beneath the surface of its 2015 Investment Outlook, there are dire warnings, including of “financial instability,” a euphemism for “crash.” Read… How Asset Manager BlackRock Gave Me the Willies About 2015 FREE AppDownload
British-based BP is negotiating with Russia’s Rosneft to buy a stake in an oil field in eastern Siberia, according to multiple sources with direct knowledge of the talks who spoke with several news organizations. The talks concern the Taas-Yuriakh field, which is situated near a pipeline leading to Russia’s Pacific coast. It would supply refineries in Russia’s Far East and elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region, including China. By 2017, the Taas-Yuriakh field will yield more 100,000 barrels a day, or more than 5 million metric tons a year. The field also contains an estimated 155 billion cubic meters of natural gas. BP’s share in the field may be as high as $700 million or even $800 million, according to the Russian business journal Kommersant, which broke the story on Dec. 24. The Russian government owns a majority stake in Rosneft, but BP owns nearly 20 percent and has stood by its commitment to the Russian oil giant despite economic sanctions imposed on Moscow’s oil industry by the European Union and the United States for its suspected role in the economic instability and violent unrest in neighboring Ukraine. Those sanctions forbid Russian oil companies to obtain Western technology for shale and offshore oil extraction and limit its access to Western financial markets for financing their initiatives. But they don’t forbid Western companies from buying Russian assets, such as shares in oil fields. Therefore the sanctions wouldn’t apply to any BP-Rosneft deal. Oil and gas account for about half of Moscow’s annual budget, and President Vladimir Putin lately has been seeking to expand sales of Russian oil and gas eastward as it loses customers in the West, notably in the European Union. Europeans feel they cannot rely on Moscow to provide energy reliably. EU customers now get about one-third of their gas from Russia, half of it through pipelines in Ukraine. As part of its eastward push, Russia has been negotiating with the China National Petroleum Corp. (CNPC) about developing the Taas-Yuriakh field. At one point, about a year ago, the field was to have become the base for a joint venture between Russia and China to explore for oil and produce it. But if BP succeeds in buying a stake in Taas-Yuriakh, it would ease Rosneft’s current financial burden. Because of the sanctions and the plummeting price of oil, Rosneft reports that its net debt rose to $45 billion by the end of the third quarter of 2015. BP’s involvement also would help exploit the field and improve its efficiency, minimizing delays in exploration and production. That’s according to Alex Fak and Valery Nesterov, two analysts at Russia’s Sberbank, a savings institution in which the Russian government owns a majority share. “This removes at least one source of concern for a company that has spread itself too thinly over the past couple of years,” Fak and Nesterov wrote in a research paper.

Oil is crashing again. On Monday afternoon, the price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil crashed to as low as $53.00 per barrel, a more than 3% decline and the lowest price for WTI since May 2009, according to Reuters. Brent crude oil, the international benchmark, also fell to its lowest price since May 2009, falling as low as $57.50 per barrel.  The move in oil marks yet another leg lower for the commodity, which has just gotten crushed over the past six months. Monday's drop in oil also comes after the latest manufacturing report from the Dallas Fed showed that business leaders in Texas were concerned about the effects from the declining price of oil. Here's Monday's quick, steep drop in WTI. FinViz And the stunning one-year chart of WTI. Business Insider   FREE AppDownload
The Russian economy took a serious beating following the western sanctions and the oil crash. The ruble plunged and inflation is way above target in the double digits.  On Monday, the Economy Ministry announced that the economy contracted for the first time since October 2009. And last week even the prime minister Medvedev expressed concerns that Russia might slide into a deep recession. But despite the onslaught of economic problems, it looks like not everyone's worried. Some Russians have started hashtagging instagram posts featuring large quantities of caviar with "#<U+043A><U+0430><U+043A><U+043E><U+0439><U+043A><U+0440><U+0438><U+0437><U+0438><U+0441>" — aka #whatcrisis. Several photos also include the hashtag #<U+043F><U+0430><U+0434><U+0435><U+043D><U+0438><U+0435><U+0440><U+0443><U+0431><U+043B><U+044F> — aka "the fall of the ruble" — as well as colorful commentary on the western sanctions.  (Note: these instagrams are not necessarily representative of how the average Russian feels.

REUTERS/Alkis konstantinidisAlexis Tsipras, opposition leader and head of radical leftist Syriza party, talks to reporters outside the parliament building after the last round of a presidential vote in Athens December 29, 2014.Greece is heading straight into a snap general election and it currently looks like radical leftists Syriza will come out on top. The latest Greek polling has Syriza six points ahead of the centre-right New Democracy. That gap has been squeezed a little compared to previous months. According to analysts at Macropolis, it's usually more like 4-5%. That polling would make Syriza the largest party in the Greek parliament (the winners of Greek elections get 50 bonus seats), and with a little coalition building, leader Alexis Tsipras is probably more likely than anyone to become the country's next Prime Minister. Tsipras is a lifelong activist who was associated with Synaspismos (which makes up the largest part of the Syriza coalition) from the early 1990s, when he was a teenager. He's still a relative youngster as far as Greek politics is concerned, at just 40. In 2006, Tsipras came third in Athens' municipal elections, and in 2008 he became leader of Synaspismos, before the beginning of the crisis. He's been in the Greek parliament since 2009, when he became the parliamentary head of Syriza. In 2012, the coalition came second in the general election and Tsipras became leader of the opposition. If you want to know what Tsipras is all about today there's no better place to start than with the transcript of his discussion at the Brookings Institute last year. Here's a taste: Truly, in my opinion, in order for us to remain in the eurozone over the long term, in order for the eurozone to survive, we need a radical change of plan. We need a rational reconsideration and review of our strategy to combat the crisis. And not just on a Greek level; on the European level. But this new strategy will not come until and only when a party like ours comes to power and say enough is enough. Not just in our country but in Brussels as well. Enough with this craziness of austerity. Syriza are campaigning on a platform that European institutions simply aren't prepared for. They're pushing for a reversal of Greece's memorandum of understanding with the Troika (the IMF, EU, and European Central Bank), meaning more public spending and the end of a reform programme that's been underway for nearly five years.  They also want a bondholder haircut. This means the government effectively defaults on a portion of its debt and people who bought its bonds get only a slice of what they paid for. Major jobs programmes and bank nationalisations are also on the cards. Tsipras is running Syriza headlong into a showdown with Europe's biggest institutions, but his arguments, at least the ones he makes to a US audience, sound more like Roosevelt than Lenin. He's insistent on staying in the euro (though that's not true of a significant chunk of Syriza), and wants a "new deal" for the European Union. His arguments about the reasons that the eurozone doesn't work very well don't sound that different to a lot of economists'. He's got some kind words for Fed chair Ben Bernanke and wishes Europe's central bankers were a little more like him. Here's another snippet, showing how well Tsipras is aware of the confrontation he's about to start: We see that the policies that Berlin is following are not only disastrous for Greece but place the entire European economy on uncertainty and on a larger level, the entire global economy. This may be a policy that is to Germany’s benefit, but it is a policy that places the global economy in danger. That’s why we’re here; because I believe that we can find allies in our effort to not only save Greece but to avert disaster for the global economy and Europe. We are psychologically prepared for a clash, for a clash because, you know, in life and in politics there is no such thing as tea and crumpets, there are interests that are conflicting with each other. Greece's showdown with Europe's existing political order doesn't just affect Greece. If they get significant concessions on debt and public spending, it will be a major boost for every anti-austerity party in Europe.  FREE AppDownload
Shake ShackShake Shack just filed for its IPO.  When a company files for an IPO, they give away all kinds of great details not just about how the business is doing, but the philosophy behind the business.  Buried in Shake Shack's filing is a disclosure that it refers to its employees at "51%ers." Here's Shake Shack: We believe that the culture of our team is the single most important factor in our success. We aim to recruit and develop a team with the innate "personality to please" that cannot be taught. We look for people who are warm, friendly, motivated, caring, self-aware and intellectually curious team members, or what we call "51%'ers." We use the term "51%" to describe the emotional skills needed to thrive at the job and "49%" to describe the technical skills needed for the job. Our 51%'ers are excited and committed to championship performance, remarkable and enriching hospitality, embodying our culture and actively growing themselves and the brand.  In its filing, the company also touts the "Shack Pact," which it displays in its stores for employees to see and is what the company calls, "the agreement we make with ourselves and with each other to uphold our principles and to hold each other accountable." Here's the "Shack Pact": Shack Shake also pays it employees more than minimum wage (though 1,450 of the company's 1,680 employees are hourly), saying in its filing that in Manhattan, for example, it starts employees at $10 per hour though minimum wage is $8 in New York. In its filing, the company said it believes this allows it "to attract a higher caliber employee and this translates directly to better guest service."  Since 2010, annual revenue has increased from $19.5 million to more than $83 million through just the first nine months of this year.  So it seems like regardless of what Shake Shack is calling its employees, the business is growing.  FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Denis BalibouseThe name Patek Philippe is among the most powerful in the entire watch industry. It is synonymous with class, conservatism, high auction values, price legitimacy, and some of the best looking traditional watches now or ever made. Patek Philippe remains an independent company whose secrets and plans are tightly guarded, and its most exclusive watches often go directly from the factory to the hands of the world's most prestigious collectors - never to be displayed in a store counter or window. When it comes to high-end timepiece auction prices, Patek Philippe leads the pack easily dominating all other watch makers in regard to achieving regular, record-setting prices. Most Patek Philippe watches that yield not-so-small fortunes during auctions as extremely rare, often unique pieces made for special collectors. Most of these bespoke Patek Philippe watches were produced in the first half of the 20th century, during a time when Patek Philippe was much more open to design and product experimentation. Though some of its most valuable timepieces (which includes both pocket and wrist watches) have been produced in the modern era. aBlogtoWatch has compiled an assortment of the world's rarest and most valuable Patek Philippe watches in terms of price, starting with a collection of 15 pieces. The list may grow over time as auction results or new watches of extremely high worth over $1,500,000 become available to share. The Sky Moon Tourbillon is without a doubt one of the most widely recognized watches that Patek Philippe has ever made. Earlier last year, in 2013, the manufacture introduced its follow-up model, now referred to as 6002G. With its astonishingly intricate (and perhaps slightly excessive) engravings adorning its 18k white gold case, the 6002G managed to elevate the already striking appearance of its predecessor to another level. Beyond its stunning aesthetics, this reference hides the most complicated wrist watch movement that Patek makes. The front of the watch displays the time, perpetual calendar with retrograde date, and the phase of the moon, while the dial on the back is reserved to address more unearthly issues. It features a stellar illustration of the northern sky as well as indications for sidereal time on a 24-hour scale, time of meridian passage of Sirius and of the moon, along with the angular progression and the phase of the moon. Although not revealed by a sapphire window on the white gold case (because it has a double-side dial), the movement's regulating organ is a one-minute tourbillon. Consisting of 69 parts and weighing a total of just 0.3 grams, it is one of the few tourbillons that are actually submitted to rigorous chronometry tests, with its rate fluctuations set not to exceed -2 and +1 seconds per day. Finally, the Sky Moon Tourbillon's 686-component caliber also features a minute repeater, chiming the time - the one that is displayed on the front dial - with its two cathedral gongs. With only two being made by Patek, the price for all this engraved haute horologerie goodness is around $1,500,000. It isn't all that that much more than a standard ref. 5002 Sky Moon Tourbillon either. Manufactured in 1947 and sold in 1950, this piece (auctioned by Christie's in November, 2013) is one of three Reference 1563 that are known to exist. Based on the 1436, it is a bi-compax chronograph and it also has the waterproof screw-in case back of the 1436. The difference is to be found in the added feature and complication of the split-seconds chronograph mechanism. Such a complication is known as one of the most difficult to assemble and produce. This particular piece is unique among the three iterations of the 1563 in that it has luminous Breguet numerals and also luminous sword hands - all original to the watch. Noted in Patek's documents concerning this watch is the fact that it actually has 1436 stamped on the inside of its caseback, though it is not written whether this is for the lack of correctly stamped components, or just because someone had a rough night the day prior to assembling this beautiful piece. What we feel certain about is that owing to its bold numerals, beautifully balanced dial layout and its sublime complication, this watch sports a timeless and, dare we say, a more sportier look, something that makes this piece hugely desirable for the collectors of today and tomorrow. The world's rarest and hence most expensive Patek Philippe watches are all unique creations which carry one or more unique accomplishments that set them apart from the rest. Having said that, this Prototype Pilot's watch from 1936 is just something else. To begin with, its movement was actually made in 1912, and it was only some 24 years later that it was set in its nickel-chromed case that is seen above. Equipped with what is referred to as a "splittable centre seconds and hour angle dial", this unique prototype has only one counterpart out there, as Patek is known to have only made two of such watches. What this weird term "hour angle dial" actually means is that the hour hand rotates once in 24 hours, indicating the degrees of arc against the center circle divided into 360. The "minute" hand rotates once every 4 hours and is read against the scale of 60. The two second hands revolve every 4 minutes, showing the angular minutes. Consequently, the time shown on the watch as pictured, reads 332 8.5', translating into 22 hours, 8 minutes and 30 seconds, the very time that all watches show in books and catalogues. Measuring in at an immense 56mm in diameter, this piece was designed to be worn by pilots who would wear it on the outside of their flight suit. A truly unique and very interesting piece that was sold by Christie's on the 11th of May, 2009, for $1,710,690. Sometimes things need not be so complicated to be desirable and, for some, to be exceedingly valuable. Big watches are in nowadays, and that makes important watches of the past which were extraordinarily large for the time in high demand. In the special world of auctions, high demand equals no limit bidding. A stellar example is this monopusher chronograph from 1932: cased in an 18k gold case measuring 46 millimeters in diameter, not only was it considered to be an extremely large watch at the time, but it still remains uncharted territory as Patek Philippe generally makes much more conservatively sized pieces. Produced as a special order and sold for Count Carlo Felice Trossi, the president of Scuderia Ferrari, not only is this watch rare, but also has the important added value of a prominent owner. It is also a rarity to have a photograph from such early times of not only the first owner, but of him actually wearing the watch. Seen in the background on the image above is the president of Ferrari, proudly wearing his custom made, 46mm Patek single button chronograph on his sleeve, where he presumably wore it for the benefit of easier access as he was timing laps. Sold by Sotheby's in May, 2008 for $2.24 million, this watch is yet another proof of the massive interest in important and unusually large watches of the past. Over the years (well, centuries), Patek has created a fantastic array of different references, most of which you will discover in our selection. While the 1591 may just be one you have not heard about before, it's clear it has something special going for it once you learn that it was featured on the cover of Christie's Geneva Important Pocket Watches and Wrist Watches Catalog in 2007. Its special blend of exceptionally refined aesthetics and stunningly complex inner workings make the 1591 an extremely desirable piece even among other historically important watches. As if that was not enough, let's add that only two, that's right, two pieces were ever made. The one sold by Christie's is, well, one of its kind being the only one housed in stainless steel, while the other piece is in 18k yellow gold. And despite the fact that it was manufactured in 1944 - at an extremely early and war-stricken time, and also set in a material that Patek has duly avoided, this piece has even more to offer. According to Christie's notes, this watch was unknown to literature and the market until 1996. That was the time when it was first offered at auction, and also when it broke the then world-record for any stainless steel wristwatch ever sold at auction. According to Patek's notes this piece was sold by its retailer in India and, as Christie's remarks, it actually was "the pride of a Maharaja who enjoyed wearing the robust timepiece occasionally when playing polo. It was then given as a present to the man in charge of organizing the Maharaja's wedding." After fetching a striking $2,240,714 all we know is that the piece can now be found at the Patek Philippe Museum... and that I never before wanted so much to be a wedding organizer in India. Another incredibly complicated pocket watch by Patek Philippe; but this has something more going for it than your average sublimely complicated Patek: it is the first ever made and recorded grand complication by the manufacture. Actually, a piece made in 1910 was broadly believed to have been the first, until this truly beautiful pocket watch was offered for auction by its owner. Made in 1898 and sold in 1900 for one of the greatest business leaders of the early 20th century America, Mr. Stephen S. Palmer. This minute repeating, perpetual calendar, split-seconds chronograph watch, with grande and petite sonnerie and moon phases, is set in 18k pink gold and is among the most important watches Patek has ever made. As it can be read on the original receipt that was also included in the sale, Palmer purchased the piece in 1900 for a hefty sum of 6,000 Swiss francs. What has not been documented, but clearly shows from the condition of the watch, is that it has been locked away for more than a century in its original box. In summary, this is the finest example of all Grand Complications known today with it not only being the first ever made, but also the one in the most stellar condition. Considering the prices that other pieces fetched in our collection of super rare Patek Philippe pieces, the fact that this piece was sold by Christies in June, 2013 for $2.25 million tells us that someone got one hell of a deal. Built around a quartz movement, this unique Patek Philippe clock's importance lies not in its mechanical complexity, but rather in its rarity and its intricate use of precious materials. Made in 1992, at the center of this presentation clock is a magpie bird, covered in two different shades of gold: in its beak is a 104.75-carat, oval-shaped tanzanite gem that is looks about to place into its yellow gold nest. The tree,sculpted from calcite, onyx and agate, is resting on a substantial piece of rock crystal, that was further adorned with yellow, white, blue and pink agate flowers and green agate foliage. All are set with diamonds, rubies and amethyst petals. As if all this wasn't enough for what appears to be the luckiest and greediest magpies in all of human history, the bird's nest contains diamond-set treasures, including a pair of scissors, spectacles, thimble, ruby-set ring and enamel-capped safety pin. Adorned with dozens of flowers, truly intricate, hand-crafted details, 24.95 carats of diamonds and 13.17 carats of rubies, this unique clock had a high-estimate of $640,000. A seemingly high price, but one that this piece surpassed with surprising ease, ultimately costing more than $2.3 million for its new owner. Launched in 1962, the Patek Philippe Reference 3448 was the first automatic perpetual calendar wristwatch ever made by any manufacture. A total of 586 were produced over nearly two decades, up until 1981, when Patek retired the 3448 to replace it with a slightly updated version referred to as 3450. Sold in 1968, this particular piece ended up with a collector who apparently had a very clear vision of what this watch will be worth decades later. So he locked it away in a safe and kept it there with the original box and certificates. 43 years later, as if nothing had happened, this 3448 was offered for auction at Christie's, straight from the original owner. The watch was in incredibly fine and original condition with a sharp and unaltered case, original and rare "PP" crown and an un-restored dial. Though the story of this 3448 did not end right there. As per the trends of the era, most iterations of this model were cased in 18k yellow gold, some were in white gold and only two were made in platinum. This piece, however, is in pink gold: a treat so rare that no archivist, auctioneer or collector knew of its existence until it was listed for auction. It is the only Reference 3448 known in this material. Once all this is taken into account, it should come as no surprise that Patek collectors had their pants and paddles on fire, as bids quickly surpassed the 500,000 to 1 million Swiss Franc estimate. Ultimately, this one-of-a-kind watch finally sold for 2.1 million francs (or $2.3 million), paying handsomely for the farseeing collector who had been nursing it for more than four decades. Following the previous array of incredibly complicated, extremely important and often made-to-order watches on our list, we have come to one that just stands out from the rest in a very unique way. It is the reference 2523 World Time watch from 1955. This is a piece that carried no unearthly importance upon its debut. The earth did not shake near Geneva upon its completion and there was no wealthy collector overseas, eagerly anticipating the moment of receiving it. It was much more of an odd piece than a practically useful one, and hence it had not received instant recognition or success. It has to be noted though that at the time of its creation in the middle of the 1950's intercontinental business trips were much less common than they are today, which rendered this watch less desirable than its similarly expensive counterparts which were equipped with other useful complications as judged by contemporary standards. In any event the original Patek Philippe World Timer is a complicated piece unto itself. The ingenious world time disc-system was invented by Louis Cottier in 1931 was later implemented by Patek, Vacheron Constantin, Rolex, and others. As times have changed, not only did this complication become one of the most popular useful functions, but the reference 2523 has also become much more appreciated among collectors, as seen by the seven figure prices these world timers consistently achieve at auctions. This version, with a hand-painted map of North America at the center of its dial, was sold by Christie's in 2012 for nearly $3 million. In addition to the Supercomplication pocket watch, here is another piece made by Patek Philippe, for Henry Graves Jr. Measuring in at only 30.5 mm in diameter, this small, tonneau-shaped watch has a lot more going for it than its simple looks would suggest. To begin with, it is the first wristwatch that he commissioned Patek Philippe to make for him. As per the manufacture's archives, this watch contains a minute repeater movement that was made in 1895, and was actually cased much later, in 1927, before it was sold to its original owner Graves Jr. It is one of four wristwatches that Patek delivered to him and it is the only one that is cased in yellow gold. The case back is engraved with the Graves' coat of arms and motto: Esse Quam Videri, "to be rather than to seem." That the elaborate movement in this watch has been hidden behind a solid case back is just another way of showing that Graves Jr. took the family motto rather seriously. Minute repeaters by Patek (and by other brands as well) remain among the most desirable and technically most challenging watches to make. This was all the more true at the time when this piece was manufactured. Production of watches with this complication remain low for their complexity and the small number of master watchmakers that are able to actually assemble them. Bear in mind that this piece is among some of the first repeater wristwatches made by Patek Philippe. Further, it was owned by someone who had been one of the most important Patek collectors ever. This should help explain the price of nearly $3 million that was paid for this piece in 2012 at a Sotheby's auction. This probably unique, cushion-shaped mono-pusher chronograph was made by Patek Philippe in 1928 and was sold in 1931. There is good reason why these dates might sound familiar to most of us, as we are presently living in a global economy that is, for the most part, hindered by a major economic crisis. In 1929 the Great Depression affected the watch industry much more severely than the one that we have been experiencing lately. Nevertheless, it was the "best clients" of certain watch brands who played a major role in keeping their favorite manufactures going. Part of this was by requesting, and paying hefty premiums for, one-of-a-kind models. The piece above is believed to be one of those made-to-order watches, one of only a handful cushion-cased chronographs produced by Patek Philippe. More importantly, it was the only single button chronograph in white gold that Patek has ever produced. That made this watch all the more desirable for collectors. It further has a timeless design which is made complete with white gold spade hands and applied Breguet-numerals. Beyond the mere rarity of the combinations of materials and design elements that are found on this watch, it is important to remember that this piece was made nearly 90 years ago yet it looks, and functions, as well as anything produced ever since then. In doubt? Just take a look at the recently released Reference 5950, a remarkably similar watch by Patek that debuted in 2010. Consider the rarity, importance and power in withstanding the passage of time and the $3.6 million dollar price will seem just that little bit easier to take in. Patek started manufacturing the Reference 2499 in 1951 and produced around ten each year, for over 35 years. For most collectors, the importance and perceived value of this model lies in its perfectly proportioned case and dial layout, combined with the three complications that define some of the most desired references of Patek even today: a perpetual calendar, phase of the moon indication and chronograph. Its desirability is further proven every time when a 2499 comes up for auction with it consistently being one of the most important lot of any sale. While only 349 pieces of this reference exist, nearly all of them were produced in yellow gold as only about 10 were made in pink gold, and just 2 were cased in platinum. Those last two pieces were actually produced not for sale but to stay within Patek, as a celebration of the three and a half decade long production run of this iconic piece. One of those two post-production platinum models did eventually leave Patek, at the historic "The Art of Patek Philippe" auction in 1989, and was sold privately until it ended up with rock legend and serious watch collector Eric Clapton. It was, and will certainly remain, the only white-metal 2499 in private hands. Since it left Patek, it was available to the public for the first time when it was sold by Christie's in 2012. The final bid for the 2499/100P exceeded 3.6 million US dollars. Although Patek has stopped producing their Reference 5004, for the 5th Only Watch auction (held in September, 2013) they went on to create one final and completely unique version, the 5004T. It is housed in a highly polished titanium case, a seldom-used material by Patek. Making the design even more distinct compared to other 5004 versions (and other Patek watches in general) is a dial made of solid gold, hand-engraved with a checkered pattern. The watch features the Manufacture's amazing caliber CHR 27-70Q, based on a blank movement created exclusively for Patek by Nouvelle Lemania. Its functions include a split-second chronograph as well as a perpetual calendar with phase of the moon indication. The 5004T, without doubt, was an unusual and very special watch from Patek Philippe. This sentiment was strongly reflected in the price the piece achieved at the auction. It had an estimate between around 400,000 and 600,000 Euros, a range this unique offering far exceeded with a final bid of 2,950,000 Euros, coming in just below 4 million USD at the time of the event. Another absolute rarity among Patek Philippe's most coveted wristwatches is this unique, chronometer certified Reference 2458. Watches with chronometric certificates might sound familiar to many: COSC is the official Swiss institution testing subjected watches individually for their timekeeping performance and issuing certificates once they pass the tests. However, timepieces with Observatory provenance are on a different level. Before the advent of quartz watches during the 1960's, Observatory Precision Contests were organized to verify the finest and specially developed movements. Patek has won over 700 titles over the course of several decades on these competitions. Joe Ben Champion, who ordered this watch, was a successful criminal defense attorney, and he also was one of the most important clients of Patek Philippe. Rumors say that he also happened to be obsessed with accuracy, an attribute that probably came in handy upon standing on the defense's side in some of the most challenging trials. A match made in heaven, he requested a Chronometer certified watch from Patek, a piece he received in the form of this very timepiece. It was equipped with a special movement of which although thirty were made to enter Observatory contests with, only two had ever been cased. To top it all off, this piece remains the only Reference 2458 in platinum and it also comes with a platinum bracelet, a leather strap, as well as an additional diamond-set dial. The Caliber 89 is the most complicated watch that Patek Philippe has ever created. The manufacture presented it in 1989 as it celebrated its 150th anniversary. The watch from initial drawings and plans to the final piece took 9 years to develop and manufacture. Its 4-level movement comprises 33 complications, among which are the perpetual calendar, sunset-sunrise and sidereal time displays, Westminster-chime on four gongs, Grand and Petite sonnerie, alarm, thermometer and a titanium-caged two-minute tourbillon. The movement itself contains 1,728 hand-finished parts, 126 jewels and weighs in at an incredible 600 grams - yes, that's just the movement! A lesser-known fact about the Caliber 89 is that not one but actually four iterations exist, one each in white, yellow and pink gold as well as one in platinum. Shown above is the yellow-gold version as sold by Antiquorum for nearly 5 million US dollars in 2009. While this remarkable piece is referred to as a pocket watch, with it being 88 millimeters in diameter and 41 millimeters thick, accompanied with an overall weight of 1,100 grams (or 2.4 pounds), it is best to keep it at home, in a safe, locked away. The Reference 1527 is the most expensive wristwatch by Patek Philippe ever sold on auction, but it is only upon a closer look when it reveals exactly why it managed to fetch such a stratospheric price. First of all, there is the time when it was made: between 1943 and 1944. It is not merely the fact that the watch was produced during the second World War, but also that this particular one of a kind piece served as a fore-runner to some of the most iconic wristwatches that Patek Philippe has made ever since. For the knowledgable Patek collector, this piece is a time machine: its elongated and slightly curved lugs, its dial layout and its unusually large diameter for the time of 37.6 mm all preceded other famous Patek references by at least a decade. Furthermore, the overall design and size of this one-of-a-kind piece remains timelessly elegant even 70 years after its creation. This piece was first available for sale more than twenty years ago when it was listed for auction. It had been locked away until it came up for auction at Christie's in 2010. It required great efforts from archivists to further research the past of this piece, as when it was first sold around 1990, there was not much known about it. Ultimately, thanks to the archives of Patek Philippe, it was revealed that it was a perpetual calendar in a reference 1527 case and as such, among the two complicated iterations of this model number ever made by the manufacture. The other piece lacked the chronograph function and belonged to Charles Stern, the first owner of Patek from the Stern family. The other piece is this unique 1527, which not only proved to be the most complicated piece of this reference, but also a time machine that preceded some of Patek's most famous wristwatches by decades. The Supercomplication is among the most complicated and historically important watches ever made by Patek Philippe, or as a matter of fact, by any other watch manufacture. With its two dials, 24 complications, more than 900 parts and a weight of over 1 pound, this 18 karat gold pocket watch pushed the limits of mechanical complexity way beyond any other watch ever produced before. Among other complications it features a perpetual calendar, a minute repeater with Westminster Chimes, sidereal time and a celestial chart including a mapping of the sky over Manhattan. Following five years of planning and assembly, it was delivered in 1933 to its customer, Henry Graves Jr., a millionaire banker and avid watch collector from New York responsible for some of the most valuable Patek Philippe watches on earth. The watch held the title of the most complicated watch for over six decades, until 1989. And while it was deprived of that title by another creation of Patek Philippe, the Supercomplication managed to claim yet another record title in 1999 as it sold for just a bit over 11 million US dollars at a Sotheby's auction. On the 11th of November, 2014, Sotheby's has re-auctioned the Patek Philippe Supercomplication, selling it for a staggering 20.6 Million Swiss Francs, making the final price $23,984,106 US Dollars including buyer's premium. This has made this magnificent watch the world record holder yet again as the most expensive timepiece ever sold.

 Shake Shack just filed to go public, which means the company will get a big cash infusion. The "better burger" chain's store and sales growth so far have been impressive. Revenues have reached $82 million in the past decade.  Still, Shake Shack has only 63 locations worldwide, many fewer than competitors such as Five Guys. The IPO funding could bring Shake Shack closer to ubiquity. Here are some opportunities for growth that the restaurant chain listed in its SEC filing. Shake Shack is still relatively small in the US, with 36 restaurants in 10 states.  The company believes that American customers, who have started going crazy for "better burger" chains, are the biggest opportunity for expansion.  Shake Shack will start expanding in the US in 2015.  Executives believe the domestic restaurant count could grow to at least 450 locations.  Despite being a relatively small chain, the company believes it has "outsize" brand awareness. In other words, a lot of people know what Shake Shack is relative to the small number of locations. The company's prospectus says it has been featured in the motion picture "Something Borrowed" and on HBO's "The Newsroom." All the hype is expected to pay off.  Excitement around the brand could help new locations thrive, and Shake Shack likely won't have to work hard to get customers.  Shake Shack is trying out a new strategy to drive sales growth at existing locations. It includes offering seasonal and regional items, such as milkshakes themed for a certain part of the country.  Shake Shack also plans to emphasize using fresh ingredients for its core burgers. Shake Shack is already popular abroad, with locations in eight countries including Dubai and the UK.  The company sees an opportunity to expand abroad further.  Markets like the Middle East and Asia are seen as being especially lucrative.  "This strategy historically has been a low-cost, high-return method of growing our brand awareness and provides an increasing source of cash flow," the company said in its filing.    FREE AppDownload
Jim McIsaac / Getty Images The quickly expanding company filed for a $100 million initial public offering on Monday. Shake Shack is known for long lines at its 34 locations in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Florida, and Massachusetts. The brand has also been expanding domestically (with new locations in Chicago and Las Vegas) and internationally.  Here's why people are so obsessed with the burger chain.  Shake Shack's burgers are more elevated than the offerings at the typical fast-food burger chain, thanks to the 100% antibiotic-free Angus beef and buttered buns. Toppings include Applewood-smoked bacon and cherry peppers. This experience aligns with the values of modern consumers, who are demanding better food quality.   Many of Shake Shack's burgers are topped with the signature sauce, which USA Today describes as "a slightly spicy, sweet and sour blend of mayo, ketchup, mustard and spices." Some copycat recipes online also call for blended dill pickles. Regardless of the ingredients, the sauce adds to the unique Shake Shack experience.  Shake Shack on FacebookA burger slathered in ShackSauce. Shake Shack controversially changed its fries from crinkle cut to traditional hand cut last year, leading to many customer complaints. Last month, CEO Randy Garutti announced that the brand was going to stick to crinkle fries, which are more popular and easier to prepare. Many Yelp reviewers recommend adding Shake Shack's homemade cheese sauce to your fries.  The New York Times calls Shake Shack the "anti-chain chain," saying that its dedication to quality and customer service bucked stereotypes of traditional fast food.  Shake Shack spends barely any money on marketing, focusing instead on the quality of food. This message has helped Shake Shack stay popular in an era when diners prefer Chipotle to McDonald's.  Shake Shack "disposed of the notion that fast food had to be precooked or even prepared quickly in favor of quality ingredients and customer experience," QSR Magazine writes. Flickr/ozmafanShake Shack's minimal marketing implies that the chain focuses on food first. Shake Shack's signature custard is the base for these frozen treats. Flavors include chocolate, vanilla, peanut butter, strawberry, and some creative specials like Nutella.  Gothamist ranks the black-and-white shake, a combination of chocolate and vanilla, among the best in New York City.  Shake Shack began as a hot dog stand in New York's Madison Square Park. Many food writers say the hot dogs, which are made of 100% hormone- and antibiotic-free beef, are an underrated treat.  "I was never let down by the hot dogs, bought from Chicago’s irreplaceable Vienna Beef, which were split down the middle, griddled and laid in a toasted potato bun with or without the classic Chicago garnishes," writes Pete Wells at The New York Times. "Better yet is the Bird Dog, a smoked chicken and apple bratwurst from Usinger’s of Milwaukee." Fried pickles on a hot dog? Oh no, you didn't. Oh yes, we did: http://t.co/PtL7Po8nBQ pic.twitter.com/KDOo62smVd  In addition to its classic menu, Shake Shack also offers special frozen dessert items at different locations. The chain serves a "Liberty Shell" custard at its Philadelphia location featuring a cannoli shell, strawberry puree, and lemon ricotta. The New Haven location serves a "Skull and Cones Concrete," which is a similar consistency to a Dairy Queen Blizzard with peanut butter, ice cream cone, and chocolate truffle cookie dough blended in.   Shake Shack has a secret menu, which Thrillist successfully tested. Items include a burger topped with bacon and peanut butter, and a grilled cheese made from buns.  Love the Peanut butter bacon burger from @shakeshack secret menu. Awesome! pic.twitter.com/XvkiJFrPJP  Founder Danny Meyer said the chain was discriminating about its meat-free options. "It’s only going to go on the menu if you would crave it even if you were not a vegetarian," he told Bon Appetit. Shake Shack is renowned for its 'shroom burger, a portobello mushroom stuffed with cheese.   Shake Shack sells beer and wine, meaning that it can double as a happy hour destination.  Selling alcohol is becoming popular among fast-casual chains who want to find another way to draw in consumers. The beer is aimed toward craft enthusiasts and includes a special collaboration with the Brooklyn Brewery.   "Unlike the workers at most fast-food outlets, Shake Shack employees give the impression that they truly like their customers," The Times' Wells writes.  Shake Shack pays workers an average hourly wage of $10.70, and it offers health benefits and paid time off. Company executives say these policies help them attract better talent, and turnover is lower than industry averages.   Waiting in Shake Shack's long line might seem like a deterrent. But many people actually like the gratification of waiting in long lines for hot products, many consumer experts told Business Insider. "There are people in the world whose identity is tied up with being a consumer of such items and who derive satisfaction from going the extra mile, or five miles, to demonstrate their dedication," David Gibson, professor of sociology at the University of Notre Dame, said.  FREE AppDownload
Battered by crises and maligned by critics, globalization is regaining momentum. And this is good news for America’s global leadership. Negotiations for an ambitious Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal involving a dozen countries from Asia and the Americas are quietly nearing the finishing line. Another historic agreement, the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) between the United States and the European Union, also shows signs of becoming a reality. Not long ago, the idea that two landmark U.S.-centered trade deals could be the pillars of President Obama’s foreign policy legacy would have seemed laughable. As a presidential candidate in 2008, Obama was a trade skeptic, painting deals like NAFTA as job-killers, which played well with unions weary of import surges from China. Once in office, however, Obama warmed to trade expansion as presidents tend to do, given the dependence of the American economy and jobs on exports and global supply chains. In 2010, Obama issued a call to double U.S. exports, with trade deals forming part of the package–only now they were described as “partnerships” that would open new markets to American businesses big and small, rather than “free trade agreements” associated, even if falsely, in the public’s mind with offshoring and job losses.  While big business spearheads the trade lobby, “Main Street” small businesses stand to gain from greater access to foreign markets and the harmonizing of product standards and regulations across borders. As an economist who has for years worked to advance free trade in both the public and private sector, I could not be more elated by the prospect that these major deals now look achievable. For more than a decade, ambitious global efforts to liberalize cross-border trade and investment had stalled. Kevin Lamarque/ReutersU.S. President Barack Obama (C) meets with the leaders of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) countries in Beijing November 10, 2014. The promise of the Uruguay Round of negotiations, which in 1994 produced the crown jewel of the global trading system, the World Trade Organization, appeared to have been lost. The Doha Round–the multilateral talks that were supposed to expand on the Uruguay Round’s gains–have been going on for 13 years, with few tangible results because of disagreements between emerging markets such as Brazil and India (who resist opening their markets to foreign manufactured products and services) and the U.S. and Europe, which are reluctant to free their agricultural markets. With any one of the WTO’s 160 member nations able to scuttle any global agreement, countries have turned to regional trade agreements or country-to-country pacts as alternatives. Since the United States, Canada, and Mexico launched the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) two decades ago, no fewer than 400 trade deals have been concluded or are under negotiation, coupling such players as Chile and China, Japan and Mexico, and the United States and Singapore, to name a few. Such deals are easier to get done than a universal WTO deal. They also tend to go deeper than WTO efforts, pioneering in the regulation of such matters as e-commerce, intellectual property, and state-owned enterprises. But for globalizing companies, they also create tremendous new complexity–a patchwork of rules and standards that differ from one market to the next. The two trans-oceanic pacts that would link us to Asia and Europe, though, would resurrect the momentum for a more comprehensive global agreement. They would also deliver considerable economic benefits. The Trans-Pacific deal (TPP) will boost U.S. annual gains by $77 billion, and Japan’s by $104 billion. The TTIP deal, by integrating markets in the U.S. and the EU, would generate $130 billion annually in economic gains for the United States, and $162 billion for Europe. Toru Hanai/Reutersapan's Economics Minister Akira Amari (R) talks with Reuters Japan Bureau Chief Kevin Krolick in Tokyo July 11, 2014.As such, it is estimated that TTIP will boost U.S. household incomes by $865 annually and create 750,000 new U.S. jobs, while TPP would generate about $1,230 per household by 2025–a great boost without a dime of deficit spending, and a strong bonus on top of the $10,000 annual income gains American households have already scored due to post-war trade opening.  These trade deals, by locking in deeper access for American interests in overseas markets, could give U.S. companies the confidence needed to unlock their considerable cash holdings and invest in the production of more export goods and the hiring of more U.S. workers. While big business spearheads the trade lobby, “Main Street” small businesses stand to gain from greater access to foreign markets and the harmonizing of product standards and regulations across borders. These new trans-oceanic deals, if achieved, would also make it costlier for nations who have opposed lowering barriers to stay their obstructionist course. The most cantankerous player in the global trading system, India, risks being left out. Ever pragmatic, China has become interested in joining TPP, in part as a means of counteracting the country’s economic slowdown and driving reforms of inefficient state-owned enterprises.  In our hemisphere, Brazil has not been interested in joining trade agreements, seeking leadership instead of its own dysfunctional Mercosur alternative. Its strategy stands in stark contrast to that of Mexico, which has forged free trade deals with partners covering some 90 percent of its trade, such as North America, the EU, and Japan. WikimediaLeaders of the BRIC countries — Brazil, Russia, India and China — meet at the BRICS summit in Brazil. As a result, Mexico has emerged as a global manufacturing hub and anchor of Latin America’s Pacific Alliance bloc, which includes the more market-oriented nations of Colombia, Peru, and Chile. Brazil’s industrial lobbies, once champions of protectionist policies, now worry about the effect of high tariffs and about being left out of global supply chains, and have broken with the government to call for a reset of the nation’s trade policy  With the Ukraine crisis, the Israeli-Palestine imbroglio, and our messy departure from Iraq and Afghanistan all stunting Obama’s foreign policy achievements, the once stalemated issue of trade expansion now looks far more doable and desirable on the Obama administration’s menu of possible legacy options. To be sure, the White House is facing complicated talks with Congress over the trade promotion authority (TPA) needed to successfully negotiate a trade deal and get it through Congress. Such a legislative license to jumpstart globalization will likely be opposed, much like the recent budget agreement was in Washington, by both the left wing of the Democratic Party and the Tea Party right within the Republican Party. This may be yet another reason that a trade legacy looks appealing to President Obama: It will take a purple coalition to do the right thing. FREE AppDownload
Flickr / Jason LamNYC burger chain Shake Shack just filed for its IPO. The paperwork includes lots of stats, including figures on growth. From 2010 to today, the company has gone from 7 shacks to 63 shacks worldwide. "During the three fiscal years ended December 25, 2013, we grew from seven Shacks in two states to 40 Shacks across six states, Washington, D.C. and eight other countries, representing a 79% compound annual growth rate," the filing noted. Total revenue has surged from just $19.5 million to $82.5 million, which represents a compound annual growth rate of 62%. These two charts say it all. SEC FREE AppDownload
Shake Shack Among the notable numbers is Shake Shack's revenue, which totaled $82.5 million for the fiscal year ended Dec. 25, 2013, and which totaled $83.8 million for the nine months ended Sept. 24, 2014.  Shake Shack is also profitable! In 2013, the company's net income totaled $5.4 million. And through the first nine months of 2014, net income has totaled $3.5 million. Shake Shack's same-shack-sales grew 5.9% in its fiscal year 2013 and were up 3% through the first nine months of 2014 when compared to the prior year.

REUTERS/StringerSmoke rises from an oil tank fire in Es Sider port December 26, 2014.LONDON (Reuters) - Brent crude oil rose to around $60 per barrel on Monday, supported by concerns about disruption to output from Libya, but a global supply glut kept prices nearly 50 percent off their peak for the year. Libya is producing a scant 128,000 barrels of oil a day from fields connected to the far eastern port of Hariga, an oil official said, as fighting kept its largest ports, Es Sider and Ras Lanuf, shut. The OPEC member nation has struggled with port blockades and protests, slashing output from the 1.6 million barrels a day it produced prior to the 2011 ousting of leader Muammar Gaddafi. A fire sparked by a rocket attack last week on storage tanks at the port of Es Sider marked an escalation in damage to the country's oil infrastructure. "There's tension in Libya, but liquidity is very thin so not much is needed to move oil prices," said Hans van Cleef, senior energy economist at ABN Amro in Amsterdam. Trade was sparse, with many investors away for the holidays. Van Cleef added that the overall picture remained bearish, with traders looking for reasons to sell. "It's very supply driven. On the demand side, the only impact is when you see a negative change in data." Brent crude &lt;LCOc1&gt; was up 51 cents at $59.96 by 9.40 a.m. after hitting $60.43. The benchmark shed 79 cents in the previous session. Brent is down around 46 percent since a year high above $115 per barrel hit in June. It has been weighed down by a decision taken by OPEC in November not to cut supply to address the slump in prices and comments since from Saudi Arabia expressing comfort with lower prices. Oil is on track for its biggest fall this year since 2008 and the second-biggest annual fall since futures started trading in the 1980s. U.S. crude &lt;CLc1&gt; rose 46 cents to $55.19 after closing $1.11 down in thin trade on Friday. It rose to a peak of $55.74 early on Monday. Keeping gains in check, uncertainty on the outlook for the economy in Europe increased after the Greek parliament rejected the government's presidential candidate, setting the stage for an election that anti-bailout party Syriza could win.

It used to be a lot easier to make a hit app. Six years ago, it seemed like all a developer had to do was upload his creation to the Apple or Google app store. Now with more than 1 million apps in each app store, it's entirely too easy to get lost in the crowd of apps. Facebook was one of the first to take advantage of the need to promote apps. Its app install ads have grown wildly popular among developers, who are expected to spend as much as $4.3 billion on them this year. Recently, Facebook rolled out a new bookmark in its mobile navigation menu called "Find Apps," which was discovered by TechCrunch writer Josh Constine. The bookmark presents about 25 personalized app recommendations from developers that purchased app install ads. This is a feature that ought to be present in the Google Play Store and Apple App Store, but has been noticeably absent (at least to me). Apple's App Store is missing personalized app recommendations. While it has its Editors' Choice and most downloaded lists, neither are curated just for you. Google does a little better with its recommendations, but most downloads are still based on what's already popular in the Top Charts. Comparatively, Facebook app install ads are targeted directly at you (at least, users that are very similar to you) based on your likes, friends, current apps, and other demographic data Facebook has on you. As a result, it's more likely you'll be interested in Facebook's app recommendations than Apple's Editor's Choice. The "App Ad Feed," as Contine calls it, functions as a list of personal app recommendations for users. And Facebook is getting paid just as much for these ads as it does for app install ads in the regular Newsfeed. Google is well ahead of Apple when it comes to app install ads and personalized recommendations. The company bought mobile ad platform AdMob in 2009, and has a strong understanding of its users Internet habits. Opening up the front page of its app store or app search results pages to advertisements from its existing app install ad customers, could double its app store revenue. Meanwhile, Apple knows a lot more about its users than you might think. Each iTunes account is connected to a credit card with valuable demographic information, and it already knows what other apps, music, and movies you're into based on previous iTunes purchases. The company also purchased app discovery site Chomp in 2012, but has yet to do much of anything with it. Still, Facebook may be better at recommending apps than both Apple and Google, and both companies are happy letting the social network do all the heavy lifting. Both app store owners benefit from Facebook's app install ads, as they take a 30% cut of any paid apps and in-app purchases. The new App Ad Feed provides Facebook with an opportunity to nourish its growing cash calf and benefits the company in a couple ways. First, a dedicated feed of app recommendations means it can afford to annoy its users less or fill more ad inventory. Second, a dedicated app feed allows Facebook to charge more per ad impression. The only reason a person would choose to browse a bunch of app ads is because they're interested in downloading a new app (or researching an article). Stronger intent means better conversions, which results in higher average ad prices for Facebook. On the other side, Facebook has to do a lot of hard work selling app install ads to developers in order to make these recommendations useful for users. That's hard work that Apple doesn't seem particularly interested in doing as its iAd mobile ad unit has yet to take off as initially predicted. Google is more likely, but is still focused on improving mobile ad revenues elsewhere. As a result, the current landscape is mutually beneficial for all three companies, and Facebook's $6.2 billion in mobile advertising revenue (trailing 12 months) looks poised to continue growing. Last quarter, 90% of Facebook's revenue growth came from mobile ads, and app installs were a large part of that. If the App Ad Feed takes on a larger role in Facebook's app or increases average ad prices as I expect it will, Facebook could outperform current revenue estimates. Margins might not be as good, however, as Facebook will have to spend more on sales teams to fill ad inventory. FREE AppDownload
 Business executives in Texas are worried about the drop in oil prices.  On Monday, the Dallas Fed's latest manufacturing survey showed that activity in Texas was slowing down. The latest composite index came in at 4.1, widely missing expectations and down big from November's reading. Expectations were for the index to come in at 9, down from 10.5 last month.  Many economists have noted that as the drop in oil prices leads to cheaper gas, American consumers stand to benefit from what is effectively a tax cut. But the big takeaway from Monday's Dallas Fed report is that businesses in Texas, which has been a major beneficiary of the shale boom, have noted the drop in oil prices and not for the better.  According to the report, among comments from business executives in metal product manufacturing was that the drop in crude oil prices was "going to make things ugly ... quickly." Another comment from an executive in the same sector said "the price of oil tanking was a surprise."  The price of oil has fallen more than 40% over the past several months, and on Monday afternoon, West Texas Intermediate crude oil was crashing again, falling below $54 in a sharp 1.8% drop. In June WTI was closer to $105.  And these concerns over the price of oil were widespread across industries in Texas.  An executive in the wood product manufacturing industry said "the price of oil makes me very concerned about the service sector," while an executive in the electrical equipment and appliance manufacturing sector said "falling oil prices will negatively affect our business." Business InsiderThe collapse in oil prices has business leaders in Texas worried. In the machinery manufacturing sector, executives expressed concern about the drop in oil prices but said they had received comments on both sides of the issue, i.e. comments that see the drop in oil as net positive and a net negative.  As one executive in this sector said: "Our business remains quite strong, and our outlook is good. However, we remain cautious over concerns about how lower oil prices will impact our midstream and downstream energy customers. We don't believe it will be a negative impact, but there could be unanticipated consequences (e.g., market fear)." Over the past several months, much of the coverage regarding oil has tackled how low the will price go and when the plunge will stop. But now that we have seen lower oil prices for several months, we will begin to see how businesses digest and adapt to this reality.   FREE AppDownload
Nine blocks away from the original Starbucks location, in a renovated 1920s-era building, stands a 15,000 square foot statement of Starbucks' heritage of coffee innovation and its soaring ambitions for the future: the Seattle Reserve Roastery. The Roastery offers visitors the experience of small lot coffee served in a variety of formats designed to appeal to coffee connoisseurs, including pour over, Chemex, Clover, siphon, French press, and other high-end brewing methods. The presentation occurs in a welcoming atmosphere, to make it nonthreatening for loyal customers to learn about the company's small lot coffees. All Reserve coffee for Starbucks locations will be roasted in this location, which the company says will equal about 1.4 million pounds of small lot coffee in 2015. Reserve coffees are currently featured in 22 dedicated locations worldwide, and Starbucks will add 100 more in the next five years. Starbucks has described the Roastery, in which a customer can follow the path of green unroasted beans through the building, as a "Willy Wonka" experience. This may be so, but the convergence of  ubiquitous piping, small Probat roasters, tasting areas, and siphon brewing stations around the central pounded-copper silo seems to recall an era of bygone industrialism, with a hint of steampunk thrown in: Flickr/adambarhan For all this, among the coffee elite, Starbucks barely gets a nod when leading U.S. coffee roasters are discussed. Scroll through any lists of the highest regarded roasters, and you'll see that companies like Counter Culture, Intelligentsia, and Stumptown -- each minuscule in comparison to Starbucks -- are the literal taste-setters among purists. These coffee innovators pioneered fair and direct trade practices, opened cupping rooms and training centers to spread coffee knowledge to both customers and baristas, and popularized alternative brewing methods. But wait a moment, didn't Starbucks also engage in the above practices? And hasn't Starbucks poured a billion dollars into ensuring that its coffee will be 100% ethically sourced by 2015? The truth may be that the company will always be seen by independent roasters and coffee connoisseurs as a mass market purveyor. But that won't stop Howard Schultz and the Starbucks management team from exercising their vision, and taking pride in the position Starbucks holds in the coffee world today.  That position will only amplify in the years to come, especially when one considers the company's profitability. Selling higher margin coffees in limited batches at exclusive Reserve locations certainly won't hurt profits, but the long-term benefit derives from educating masses of coffee drinkers about higher end, more labor-intensive brewing methods, and creating a yen for more subtle coffee flavors. Thus, exclusive Reserve locations are designed to kindle a desire in customers to enjoy a theoretically better-tasting cup of coffee at their home base, neighborhood cafes. The company has expanded the number of stores offering its proprietary Clover brewing system to nearly 1,000 in 2014, and global Reserve coffee availability will grow from 800 to 1,500 stores by the end of FY 2015. So while the Roastery and Reserve tasting stores may be a proud statement of Starbuck's artisanal credentials, they're also the tip of the company's spear in meticulously and patiently moving consumers up the coffee chain. Consider that a Reserve coffee brewed via a nondrip process sells at a 100% premium or higher to the typical Starbucks brewed coffee. A tall (12 ounce) brewed cup of the company's standard Pike's Place or Blonde Roast sells for roughly $1.75 in my own city, whereas a similarly sized Reserve lot coffee brewed on a Clover sells for between $3.25 and $3.75.  When Starbucks began offering pour-over method coffee in its stores in 2010, some wondered if this would backfire, as the company had built its empire on funneling customers through the gauntlet of its early morning coffee lines. But management has utilized coffee premiumization to its advantage, promoting pour-overs, Clover-brewed coffee, and other slow production methods during off-peak hours. It's a powerful formula: push higher margin products during dayparts in which the labor capacity is underutilized. Extrapolate this math as the global coffee drinking population yields to Starbucks' premium coffee evangelism, and one can see why the Roastery in Seattle is simultaneously a shrine to coffee engineering, and the crux of the roasters' future margin ambitions.

The idea that data on happiness and well-being can be used to guide government policy has steadily gained popularity over the past decade. But as we seek ways to replace, or at least complement GDP as a measure of national success, we risk falling into old traps. One measure that is gaining popularity all over the world is particularly problematic. It has long been accepted that GDP is a woefully inadequate measure of national well-being. As Bobby Kennedy put it as far back as 1968, this type of macro-economic indicator “measures everything, in short, except that which makes life worthwhile.”. Since then, the Beyond GDP movement has gained momentum. Canada, for example, has introduced an Index of Wellbeing, and the OECD has organised the Better Life initiative. In the UK, the Office for National Statistics is leading the Measuring National Well-being programme, and has developed a well-being framework that includes multiple dimensions of life, including health, relationships, work, the natural environment, and political participation. All this is good news. Any movement away from GDP fetishism towards a more holistic and meaningful definition of national well-being should be welcomed. However, in the midst of this progress, there is a danger that GDP fetishism might simply be swapped for unthinking devotion to another simplistic metric. Subjective well-being – measurements of how happy and satisfied people feel – is increasingly seen as a yardstick that provides a summary of all the other aspects of well-being. A huge literature around the new science of happiness provides legitimacy for this type of thinking, and the term “well-being” is now often used simply as shorthand for the psychological state of happiness and satisfaction. But subjective well-being (SWB) is not a reliable indicator of true, objective well-being. Poor and disadvantaged people might, for example adapt to their deprivation and mark themselves high on the life-satisfaction scale. A high subjective well-being score in this context might simply reflect people making the best of a bad lot. It doesn’t mean that poverty should be ignored. In a similar vein, people whose caviar consumption decreases from once a week to once a month might suffer a drop in subjective well-being as a consequence, but the impact on their overall objective well-being is probably not worthy of much attention from the government. The fact that average SWB does not always reflect the objective quality of people’s lives is evident from subjective well-being trends since the financial crisis of 2008. Even though the meltdown led to significant, objective hardship for many people, average subjective well-being in the UK remained stable. Despite this serious problem, it might be that SWB has gained traction because of its shared historical roots with GDP. Both feed off the utilitarian tradition that human well-being boils down to maximising pleasure or satisfaction. Also, like GDP, SWB is a simple, quantitative, headline metric that lends itself to standard econometric methods. These shared roots and practical compatibility mean that SWB is an easy substitution for GDP as the principal measure of national well-being. However, like GDP, SWB also fails to capture many of the things that make life worthwhile. So while we should welcome the idea of well-being becoming part of the way a government measures national success and progress, it looks a lot like the well-being agenda is being hijacked by utilitarianism. GDP and SWB are close cousins. A truly radical model would go beyond both. FREE AppDownload
With just days left to go, 2014 seems certain to be the warmest year on record, or at least the runner-up. International agreement on robust action to limit global warming remains inadequate: the just-completed Lima climate-change conference delivered some progress, but no major breakthrough. Away from the diplomatic circuit, however, technological advances make it certain that we can build low-carbon economies at minimal cost and great benefit to human welfare. Solar energy reaching the earth’s surface provides 5,000 times humanity’s energy needs. The technology to capture it cost effectively and cleanly is available. Indeed, photovoltaic module prices have fallen 80% since 2008 and the best utility-scale solar projects can now produce electricity for less than $0.10 per kilowatt-hour. Optimists say that solar energy will become economical without subsidies later this decade, while pessimists put the break-even point in the 2020s. The question is when – not whether – this will occur. Though progress on energy-storage technologies has been less dramatic, it has been sufficient to make green transport feasible. The price of lithium-ion battery packs has fallen from around $800 per kilowatt-hour in 2009 to $600 in 2014, and will likely be below $300 by 2020 and $150 by the late 2020s. Once the price is below $250, the total cost of owning and running an electric car will be less than for one with an internal combustion engine (assuming gasoline prices of $3.50 per US gallon). REUTERSA visitor looks at BYD E6 electric car on display at the New Energy Auto Expo in Nanjing.Of course, the precise pace of progress is uncertain. But a future in which carbon-free transport is possible is assured. And our cities will be cleaner, quieter, and more pleasant places to live as a result. Progress on other technologies is also essential. Hydrogen or biofuels will probably be needed to power those applications – particularly aviation – that require high energy-to-weight ratios. And building a low-carbon economy will entail huge investments in power capacity and transmission, energy-efficient buildings, mass-transit systems, and electrical charging networks. The New Climate Economy report, launched by the United Nations in September, estimates that the investment required over the next 15 years will total $14 trillion. But the incremental capital costs relative to a high-carbon economy are a smaller $4 trillion, less than a third of 1% of global GDP over that period. And the maximum sacrifice of future income per capita will be no more than 1-4% of global GDP. That means that the world might have to wait, say, until December 2051 to reach the income and prosperity level that it would otherwise have achieved the preceding January. So we do not need fossil fuels to support prosperous economies. If some extra-terrestrial thief came in the night and stole two-thirds of the planet’s coal, gas, and oil reserves, all of humanity could still enjoy the household appliances, information-technology products and services, heating, lighting, and mobility that define the modern world. But no such thief exists, and we are cursed with fossil fuels in dangerous abundance. Some environmentalists claim that we will soon reach “peak fossil fuels,” making green energy essential not only for the climate, but also for continued growth. Sadly, that is not the case. REUTERS/Todd Korol An oil rig drills near the Suncor Firebag in-situ oil sands operations near Fort McMurray, Alberta, September 17, 2014.Total gas and coal reserves could support current demand for more than a hundred years, and technological progress – for example, hydraulic fracturing, which has unlocked shale energy – makes an ever growing share of these reserves economically attractive. Oil production may peak within the next few decades, but gasoline equivalents can be synthesized from gas or coal. As 2014 draws to an end, falling oil, gas, and coal prices threaten to undermine investment in green energy and stimulate wasteful consumption. In the United States, sport and crossover utility vehicles – the largest of which are five meters long and weigh 2.6 tons – are the automobile market’s fastest growing sector. The human-welfare benefit of these behemoths is unclear to those who, like me recently, are allocated one for a trip to the airport from midtown Manhattan. The legroom is no longer, the headroom no taller, and the seats no more comfortable than in a mid-size saloon car. One and a half tons of unnecessary steel are simply hitching a ride. The biggest threat to a prosperous low-carbon future is not a lack of technological options, but the waste that low fossil-fuel prices encourage. To believers in rational economic choice, of course, there is no waste. If people choose to drive enormous cars, they must derive some benefit from it; and if switching to green energy makes that choice uneconomic, human welfare must suffer. But economic theory based on real-world experience tells us that consumer preferences are neither given nor absolute. Rather, they are stimulated in a self-reinforcing fashion by group norms, trends, and advertising, and some increases in consumption deliver no permanent increase in life satisfaction. A world in which 2.6-ton vehicles were prohibitively expensive for single-passenger use would entail no sacrifice of human welfare. When Roman Catholic bishops called earlier this month for an end to fossil-fuel use, their intervention was criticized for being out of touch with economic realities. But the bishops’ economics is impeccable. Committing to phase out fossil fuels would strengthen incentives for technological innovation; and if consumer preferences are socially determined, even unsaintly consumers would lose nothing in the long term. Sadly, the bishops have less influence over divine action than over economics: Whatever deity might have put fossil fuels on earth has shown no willingness to take them back. Maybe this holiday season we should wish for a miracle. Absent that, we should commit to leaving most fossil fuels forever in the ground. FREE AppDownload
If you follow stock-market punditry obsessively like we do, you'll quickly notice something. A handful of analysts speak English. But the vast majority don't. Rather, they speak a language unique to the investment business. This language consists of market phrases that sound intelligent but don't mean anything. The phrases don't sound like they don't mean anything, of course. On the contrary, they sound like they mean a lot. In fact, they make the speaker sound as wise as Warren Buffett (who, to his great credit, never speaks this way).  Most of these phrases have another key benefit, which is useful in the investment business: They never commit the speaker to any specific recommendation or prediction. In other words, no matter what happens, the analyst can always be "right" and never be "wrong" — because they didn't actually say anything. So if you want to sound smart about investing without really saying anything, read on. FREE AppDownload
 We recently posted a list of handy math tricks, and among them is a quick way to estimate how long it will take to double an investment with a given rate of return.  That trick is the rule of 72: Take your interest rate, and divide it into 72.  For example: If you expect a 6% average annual return, the doubling time will be 72/6 = 12 years. That's much easier than trying to reverse engineer some complicated compound interest formula. The reason this works comes from the basic formula for the future value of an investment receiving compound interest continuously. If you have an initial investment principal of P, and an annual interest rate r, then after t years your investment will have a value of Pert, where e is Euler's number, an irrational number that shows up all over the place in mathematics. We're interested in figuring out how long it will take for an investment to double with a given interest rate, so we want to know how long it will take for our investment to grow from P to 2P. In other words, we want to solve the equation 2P = Pert for the time t. First, assuming our principal P is not zero, we can cancel out the Ps on both sides of the equation, giving us 2 = ert. Now, we have to get rid of the exponential function on the right hand side. Fortunately, the natural logarithm function, usually written as "ln," can do this for us by definition: Logarithms are the inverses of exponential functions, and the natural logarithm "undoes" an exponential function with a base of e. This gives us ln(2) = ln(ert) = rt. Because we're solving for time, we can divide both sides of the equation by our interest rate r, which gives us our result of t = ln(2)/r. ln(2) is an irrational number, but if we plug this into a calculator, we get ln(2) = 0.693147... which we can round off and say that ln(2) is about 0.69. Because interest is usually given as a percent rate, multiplying 0.69 by 100 gives us 69, and so for a percent interest rate r, our doubling time should be about 69/r. Sixty-nine, however, is not a particularly convenient number. The only numbers that evenly divide into 69 are 1, 3, and 23, so if we have an interest rate other than 1%, 3%, or 23%, that division gets awkward. Instead, because we're just coming up with a quick mental estimate, we can use either 70 or 72, and we can evenly divide any whole number rate up to 10% into one or the other of those and get a pretty close estimate of our doubling time.

American Enterprise InstituteMark Perry at the American Enterprise Institute published this chart last week that puts the impact of low gas prices into very interesting perspective. He looked at the effect of lower gas prices, combined with average fuel use and average hourly wages over time. The chart plots how many hours the average worker needs to clock in to buy 100 miles worth of gasoline. It's currently 27.2 minutes of work, the lowest since 1999. By Perry's estimate, a further 26 cents decline (to $2.10) in the price of gas per gallon would be the cheapest in history, adjusted for fuel use and wages. Drivers in over a dozen US cities are already paying less than $2 for a gallon of gasoline, according to GasBuddy, a price tracker. Thanks to cheaper oil, gas prices have plummeted in the last few months, putting more discretionary income in consumers' pockets.  FREE AppDownload

Mike Nudelman/Business InsiderMarc Andreessen. He believes US economy is not facing an era of secular stagnation. Secular stagnation is the idea that the economy won't be able to create enough demand to sustain its growth trend unless interest rates are extraordinarily low. The idea has been much debated since Larry Summers addressed it in a speech at the IMF last year.  In November, we highlighted comments from Goldman Sachs economist Jari Stehn, who revisited Summers' hypothesis about a year after his speech. Stehn argued that so far, the US economy is showing signs it might not be fated to secular stagnation. And in a long, pre-dawn (in California time) tweetstorm, noted venture capitalist Marc Andreessen also argued that the secular stagnation Summers and others are so worried about — namely that we are fated to a subpar economy for the foreseeable future — may be overblown.  Andreessen sees an economy that faces the core problem of too much capital facing too few investment opportunities, rather than an economy that is simply stuck in the mud and can't get back to a pre-financial crisis growth trend.  Here are Andreessen's full comments: 1/A few tentative conclusions on secular stagnation &amp; our economy, with vigorous disclaimer that I am far from a macroeconomist... #stag  2/It seems a core dynamic of our times is too much capital relative to the number of productive investible economic opportunities. #stag  3/Coupled with a massive global capital flight to quality since 2008, hard to see interest rates rising dramatically anytime soon. #stag  4/While I am a bull on technological progress, it also seems that much of that progress is price deflationary in nature...  5/...so even extremely rapid tech progress may not show up in GDP or productivity stats, even as it = higher real standards of living. #stag  6/I think economists, particularly on the center-left and left, are really underestimating 2 factors that are inhibiting investment. #stag 7/In developed world, sheer level of regulatory burden on business formation and growth. Per George McGovern: http://t.co/jqEQdPiWgp #stag  8/On this point I agree deeply with @peterthiel: Many sectors of Western business are now wired to prevent or inhibit new investment. #stag  9/In the developing world, often brutally high levels of corruption and expropriation, making new investment extremely risky. #stag  10/It seems straightforward to identify ways to increase rate of investment, and also hard to see how any of that politically happens. #stag  11/For these and other reasons, we may be living with an oversupply of capital relative to opportunity set for a long time. #stag  12/But this is not necessarily a terrible world to live in. In fact, it might be a wonderful world to live in, for these reasons: #stag  13/Oversupply of capital means that any investable project can get funded. We see that today in tech, and it may broaden from here. #stag  14/We may experience a massive global demographic tailwind, as huge # of young people worldwide are fully connected to modern economy. #stag  15/Virtuous cycle of science &amp; tech advances, with fast-growing # of scientists &amp; technologists globally, may overwhelm expectations. #stag  16/In this world, we can have massive advances in real standards of living even w/formally low investment, GDP, &amp; productivity growth. #stag  17/Beyond that, a world where 7 billion people decide they really do want and deserve an upper-middle-class Amercan-equiv lifestyle... #stag  18/...may make all of these current stagnation theories look as silly as Alvin "Secular Stagnation" Hansen now looks 76 years later. #stag     Disclosure: Marc Andreessen is an investor in Business Insider.

Russia's economy shrank sharply in November and the rouble resumed its slide on Monday as Western sanctions and a slump in oil prices combined to inflict the first contraction in GDP since the global financial crisis. The Economy Ministry said gross domestic product shrank 0.5 percent last month, the first drop since October 2009. With oil exports forming the backbone of the economy, analysts said the contraction is likely to worsen. The slide on the oil market accelerated this month after the exporters' group OPEC refused to cut output, and prices are down almost 50 percent from a peak in June. On top of this, the sanctions imposed over Moscow's role in the Ukraine crisis have deterred foreign investment and led to over $100 billion flooding out of the Russian economy this year. "With the current oil price we expect things to get worse. There is no cause for optimism," said Dmitry Polevoy, chief economist for Russia and CIS at ING Bank in Moscow. "This is linked to sanctions first of all, oil and the panic we saw on the market in December. The damage to the banking system and consumer sentiment will take a long time to repair." The sanctions have severely reduced the ability of Russian companies to borrow abroad, triggering the worst currency crisis since Russia defaulted on its debt in 1998. The rouble, which had strengthened on Friday, slumped over 6 percent against the dollar in early trade on Monday in thin trade, although it later regained some of the losses. Overall the ruble's weakness will inevitably lead to higher inflation next year by pushing up the cost of imports, threatening President Vladimir Putin's reputation for ensuring Russia's prosperity. Government ministries forecast the slump in oil prices will lead to a 4 percent contraction of the economy next year and that inflation could exceed 10 percent. The rouble had lost more than half of its value at one stage in December, although it has recovered since then after the government introduced informal capital controls and raised interest rates steeply. The government issued orders to large state-controlled oil and gas exporters Gazprom &lt;gazp.mm&gt; and Rosneft &lt;rosn.mm&gt; to sell some of their dollar revenues to shore up the rouble. Russians have kept a wary eye on the exchange rate since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Hyper-inflation wiped out their savings over several years in the early 1990s and the rouble collapsed again in 1998. At 9.00 a.m., the rouble had lost over 3 percent against the dollar and was trading at 56.00 &lt;rubutstn=mcx&gt;, hurt by exporters scaling back foreign-currency sales after meeting their end-of-month tax payments. The Russian currency is much weaker than the 30-35 seen in the first half of the year but well up from an all-time low of around 80 per dollar in mid-December. The ruble's slide has prompted huge buying of foreign currency in Russia and heavy withdrawals of bank deposits, heaping pressure on a vulnerable banking sector whose access to Western capital markets is restricted by the sanctions. On Friday, Russian authorities also significantly scaled up rescue funds for Trust Bank, saying they would provide up to $2.4 billion in loans to bail out the mid-sized lender, the first bank to fall victim to the crisis.

REUTERS/Fahad ShadeedSaudi shares will finally be open to world investors. It's worth just shy of $500 billion, and until now, international investors have been basically blocked from buying Saudi stocks. Investors from gulf states were able to invest, but the largest exchange in the Arab world was inaccessible to anyone from further afield. Accessing exchange-traded funds was the best any other investors could hope for. That all ends in just four months, according to Bloomberg:  The Capital Market Authority informed brokers and fund managers of the timeline in London last month, two of the people said, asking not to be identified as the meeting was private. Saudi Arabia isn’t planning significant changes to draft rules published in August, the people said. The country announced in July that it would open the market in the first half of 2015.  By market capitalization, the Tadawul (Saudi stock exchange) is about the same size as the Moscow Exchange ($492.6 billion) and five times as big as Dubai's ($97.3 billion), according to the latest data from the World Federation of Exchanges.  Earlier this year, Ashmore Group noted the big opportunities in Saudi Arabia, with rapid consumption growth driving stocks. One of the key policies announced in Saudi Arabia was the labour reform introduced since the Arab Spring. This policy is designed to encourage employment of local rather than cheaper foreign workers. While in the near term this may mean higher wage costs and resultant slower growth, this policy also creates a catalyst for growth in domestic consumption. The government has also increased minimum wages, opened doors to allow a greater number of women to enter the workforce and introduced unemployment benefits. Together this means higher discretionary income which is driving Saudi consumer spending growth to be amongst the highest in Emerging Markets. Those are looking a little less rosy now that oil prices have dropped. The Tadawul is down about 20% since September. But it's still up about 2% since late December last year, suggesting some resilience even as Brent crude prices have tumbled by nearly half.   FREE AppDownload
NOTE: This post was originally published on Dec. 23, 2014. I have been watching the junk bond (and leveraged loan) market very closely over the past few months mainly because risk appetites there have been closely tied to stock prices for a very long time. In fact, since the bull market was born in March of 2009 until this summer high-yield risk appetites (as measured by the ratio of the high-yield ETF to the 5-year treasury bond) and stock prices have had a 98% correlation coefficient. The Felder Report The Felder Report Well, the popular explanation has been that the junk market has a much higher exposure to energy so the oil crash will have a much larger impact. For that reason, stocks are rightly “decoupling” from the junk market, or so it goes. To me this argument sounds more than a little specious. The energy component in junk is about 14%. This compares to an 11% weighting in the S&amp;P 500 so there’s a difference there, to be sure, but not a very significant one. And as Howard Marks recently wrote, “It’s historically unprecedented for the energy sector to witness this type of market downturn while the rest of the economy is operating normally. Like in 2002, we could see a scenario where the effects of this sector dislocation spread wider in a general ‘contagion.'” The energy boom over the past few years, driven by fracking technology, has been a major boon to the overall economy. The fact that fracking is now unprofitable means that boom is likely to bust. Believing that the boom was a positive but the bust won’t be is wishful thinking at best. Interestingly, this morning T. Boone Pickens said he believed that weak demand was more to blame for the crash in the price of oil than excess supply. If this is the case it has much greater implications for the economy than if supply were the main culprit. But setting the energy debate aside, investors should also consider the action in investment grade yield spreads which have widened, as well. They only have 6% exposure to energy so are much less exposed to the potential bust. Not just #highyield (15% energy) with wider spreads, but IG (6% energy) is much wider too. Very rare with record $SPX pic.twitter.com/cX69dWUR22 Leveraged loans are only made up of 4% energy. Still, risk appetites there have been just as weak as those in high-yield: The Felder Report To me, this all points to broader risk appetites responding to growing risks within AND beyond the energy sector or what Marks refers to as, “contagion.” But why should these risks matter to equities? The answer is because high-yield bond investors and equity investors face the very same risks. What is the ultimate risk in owning a high-yield bond? It is the risk of the company falling into a situation where their income can no longer support their debt and they are forced to default. The ultimate risk for equity investors is just the same. However, bond holders have seniority over equity investors. Equity investors, in fact, face even greater risk of loss of principal than high-yield or leveraged loan investors do because bond holders usually have some sort of covenants that hopefully ensure recuperation of their principal to some degree. This is not the case for equity investors. You would think, then, that when bond holders begin pricing in greater risk of default equity investors should sit up and pay attention (at least some do). So I find it very fascinating that while investors in the debt markets are pricing in greater risks, equity investors feel comfortable in paying ever higher prices (accepting less and less “margin of safety”). Historically, it’s equity investors that prove to be oblivious to the growing risks that high-yield investors begin to pay attention to rather than high-yield investors overreacting. As I’ve written before, high-yield spreads widened dramatically prior to equities topping in out in both 2000 and 2007 . In those cases, bond investors obviously proved to be fairly prescient. Today’s divergence between the two is even greater than those past episodes. Given that the correlation between the two is so high and for good reason, it’s interesting to note that junk bond risk appetites now imply a level of 1800 on the S&amp;P 500 (based on their daily correlation over the past five years of 98%), fully 13.5% below its current price. Now I don’t know how this gap will be closed, whether stocks will decline or high-yield risk appetites will recover or some combination of both. I do believe, however, that the bond markets are pricing in increasing risks that some have been warning about for quite some time and that the equity market, for the moment, is ignoring. So who are these indiscriminate buyers in equities? It’s not retail investors. As Jason Goepfert pointed out in his letter last night, outflows from mutual funds and ETFs have been above average even for December, a month where we typically see outflows. My guess is that it could be a various group of the dumbest of the dumb money. In that group I would include indexers who are value agnostic. (Don’t get me wrong; I’m a fan of roboadvisors but I recognize the risk their growing popularity poses.) I would also include algorithmic trading, which buys and sells stocks based on who knows what (a couple of words in the Fed statement?), certainly not any kind of traditional investment philosophy. Finally, I would point to foreign buyers who are desperate to escape the confines of their weakening economies, plunging currencies and falling equity markets at home. Again, I’ll refer to the brilliant Howard Marks: For the last few years, interest rates on the safest securities – brought low by central banks – have been coercing investors to move out the risk curve. Sometimes they’ve made that journey without cognizance of the risks they were taking, and without thoroughly understanding the investments they undertook. Now they find themselves questioning many of their actions, and it feels like risk tolerance is being replaced by risk aversion. This is definitely now occurring in the fixed income markets. In the equity markets I believe they are still, ‘moving out the risk curve without cognizance of the risks they are taking.’ But if Marks is right and we are now switching from a period of “risk on” to “risk off,” the widening in high-yield spreads (inverted) may have much farther to go: The Felder Report This article originally appeared at TheFelderReport.com.

We all have things that we want to achieve in our lives: getting into better shape, building a successful business, raising a wonderful family, writing a best-selling book, winning a championship, and so on. And for most of us, the path to those things starts by setting a specific and actionable goal. At least, this is how I approached my life until recently. I would set goals for classes I took, for weights that I wanted to lift in the gym, and for clients I wanted in my business. What I'm starting to realize, however, is that when it comes to actually getting things done and making progress in the areas that are important to you, there is a much better way to do things. It all comes down to the difference between goals and systems. Watch all the latest Entrepreneur video here.
Wikimedia CommonsA gigantic statistic surfaced this weekend about fund flows this past week, which shattered every weekly record on the books: Investors in U.S.-based funds poured $36.5 billion into stock funds in the latest weekly period, marking the biggest inflows on record as U.S. stocks surged to record highs, data from Thomson Reuters Lipper service showed on Friday. The massive cash commitments for the week ended Dec. 24 were the biggest since Lipper’s records began in 1992. Investors pledged entirely to funds that specialize in U.S. stocks, which attracted $39 billion, while funds that invest in non-U.S.shares posted $2.5 billion in outflows. The demand came from both retail and institutional investors, with stock mutual funds attracting $12.8 billion and stock exchange-traded funds attracting $23.7 billion. I think it’s safe to say: a) we can drop the whole “Most hated bull market ever” thing. b) Wow – stock ETFs took in double what stock mutual funds took in. This is advisors and younger investors putting money to work, not just paint-by-numbers 401(k) contribution. c) the pure hatred of overseas stocks remains apparent in this data. The degree to which people are willing to chase US stocks while forsaking the stocks from around the world is hitting a fever pitch.

As regular readers know, I've become increasingly worried about stock prices over the past 15 months. I'm not predicting a crash, necessarily — my concern is based largely on valuation, and valuation unfortunately tells you nothing about what stocks will do next — but I certainly wouldn't be surprised by one. And you shouldn't be, either. I've discussed my concerns in detail here. And I've also explained why, despite these concerns, I'm not selling. For today, here are two charts that illustrate just how expensive stocks are. First, professor Robert Shiller's cyclically adjusted PE ratio. As you can see, according to this measure, stocks are now more expensive than they have been at any time in the past 130 years, with the exception of 1929 and 2000. Robert Shiller, Business Insider Second, here's a look at a measure that has been described as Warren Buffett's favorite stock-market indicator: market capitalization to GDP. Specifically, this measure looks at the level of the Wilshire 5000, a broad stock index, to US gross domestic product. This measure is higher than at any time in history. Period. St. Louis Fred Yes, when interest rates are low, the "fair value" of stocks is higher than it is when interest rates are higher. But that fair value is not as high as stock prices are today. Stock prices can also go down when interest rates are low (see Japan and the US in the Great Depression). And interest rates can change. Yes, you can also quibble with both of these measures and others. The market index to GDP, for example, doesn't take into account the increasing contribution of international operations to US companies' revenue. The average Shiller P/E has been much higher in the past 30 years than it has been in all previous history, suggesting that something may have permanently changed. Etc. But these are just quibbles. And even if you assume that historical relationships have permanently changed and that interest rates will stay low forever, you can't easily conclude that today's stock prices are "fair." You can merely conclude (or at least hope) that stock prices can just keep going up. And that's certainly possible. Anything is possible. But if the market should suddenly drop 30% to 50% or more, don't act surprised. Because it won't be a surprise. Every historically valid valuation measure out there suggests that that's exactly what will happen. The only question is, "when?"

Thomson ReutersBillionaire activist-investor Carl Icahn gives an interview on FOX Business Network's Neil Cavuto show in New York(Reuters) - Carl Icahn reported a 7.7 percent stake in Manitowoc Co Inc , and became the second activist investor this year to push for a splitup of the company's crane and foodservice equipment businesses. Manitowoc's shares rose 11 percent to $23.25 before the bell on Monday. Ralph Whitworth's Relational Investors urged the company to spin off the foodservice equipment business in June, when it reported an 8.5 percent stake in the Wisconsin-based company. Manitowoc's crane business has been hurt by weak demand for its rough-terrain and boom trucks, and the company said in October that it expected revenue in the business to decline by a mid-to-high single-digit percentage in 2014. The crane business contributed nearly 62 percent of Manitowoc's total revenue of about $4 billion in 2013. Revenue in the foodservice business, which makes ice machines, refrigerators, deep fryers and other cooking equipment, increased about 3 percent in the third quarter ended Oct. 27, while revenue in the crane business fell 6 percent. Icahn said he would seek board representation, "if appropriate." (http://1.usa.gov/1xtzti9) Icahn said he had not yet had any discussions with the company, which has a market value of about $2.80 billion. Manitowoc was not immediately available for comment. Up to Friday's close, its stock had fallen about 10 percent this year, compared with a 13 percent rise in the S&amp;P 500 index .  (Reporting by Rohit T.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures were slightly lower on Monday, as investors found few reasons to keep pushing shares higher following a sharp rally that has taken major indexes to repeated records. The Dow has risen for seven straight sessions, the longest streak for the blue-chip index since March 2013, while the S&amp;P 500 is up 5.9 percent over the past seven sessions, ending at its 52nd record close of the year on Friday. The speed and scale of the rally could make further gains difficult to come by, especially in the final trading week of the year, when many market participants are out on holiday and there are few trading catalysts. Trading volume is expected to remain light, which could leave the market more susceptible to big swings. Biotech stocks were among the biggest movers of the premarket session. Gilead Sciences &lt;GILD.O&gt; rose 2.1 percent to $95.75 before the bell after Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock to "overweight" from "equal-weight." Juno Therapeutics &lt;JUNO.O&gt; rose 7.5 percent to $52.37 after the company, in an 8-K filing, authorized a stock buyback program of 495 million shares. Energy shares will continue to be in focus as crude oil &lt;CLc1&gt; rose 1.3 percent to $55.41 on concerns about disruption to exports from Libya. Oil has dropped in 12 of the past 13 weeks, weighing on the S&amp;P energy index &lt;.SPNY&gt;, which is by far the weakest sector of the year, down 9 percent. Indexes are on track to close out a third straight positive month. Thus far in December, the Dow is up 1.3 percent, the S&amp;P is up 1 percent and the Nasdaq is up 0.3 percent. In the fourth quarter, the Dow is up 5.9 percent, the S&amp;P is up 5.9 percent and the Nasdaq is up 7 percent. Both the S&amp;P and Nasdaq are on track for their eighth straight quarterly gain, the longest for the S&amp;P since 1998 and the longest for the Nasdaq since 1996. In 2014, the Dow is up 8.9 percent in its sixth straight yearly gain, the S&amp;P is up 13 percent and the Nasdaq is up 15 percent. Recent gains this year were fueled by strong economic data, including a bullish read on economic growth last week, as well as accommodative measures from central banks.

For years, there wasn’t much new or exciting in the world of whiskey. Old bottles collected dust while consumers instead sought out craft beers and wines or resorted to hard liquor standbys like vodka and gin. But that’s started to change. The prototypical whiskey drinker may have once been an older gentleman enjoying an afternoon Scotch-on-the-rocks, but bourbon and whiskey hold a growing appeal to young people and women, says Credit Suisse spirits analyst Kieran McGrath. Whether it’s characters on popular television period dramas such as Mad Men and Boardwalk Empire refocusing attention on Manhattans and Old Fashioneds, or mixologists reviving classic whiskey and bourbon libations in ultra-hip cocktail lounges, whiskey is hot again. The whiskey renaissance is part a larger shift among U.S. consumers toward hard liquor. Spirits have climbed from less than 29 percent of total alcohol sales in 2000 to a record high of nearly 35 percent in 2013. Americans are consuming about 30 percent more spirits than they did two decades ago, while total alcohol consumption has only increased 8 percent, according to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. And according to a recent Gallup poll, more than twice as many 18—29 year olds prefer liquor today than in the mid-90s. According to McGrath, the U.S. recession and the uneven economic recovery that followed play a major role in the shift to hard liquor. “America’s blue-collar and middle-class has been left behind,” he says. “By extension, a core beer-drinking market has been lost.” And whereas cheap liquor offers more bang for the buck than a similarly priced beer, premium whiskeys are much more expensive per milliliter of alcohol than high-quality beer. Thus, McGrath says, spirits can be “defensive in downturns and aggressive in upturns.” But whiskey and bourbon weren’t the first beneficiary of the growing taste for spirits – vodka was. The total value of vodka sales jumped 50.6 percent between 2002 and 2010, according to the Distilled Spirits Council, or DISCUS. But that run is officially over, as whiskey and bourbon accounted for 80 percent of all 2013 sales growth in U.S. spirits. Vodka revenues grew just 1.1 percent in 2013, while gin sales fell 3.8 percent, DISCUS data shows. And it’s not just the cheap stuff that’s selling, McGrath says, pointing to the fact that the number of cases of super-premium bourbon sold rose from 662,000 in 2008 to 1.23 million in 2013. Renewed enthusiasm for brown spirits may also spring from consumers’ growing preferences for alcoholic beverages with a sense of “authenticity and heritage.” Consumers clearly appreciate the authenticity of craft beers, but whiskey’s heritage puts them to shame, says McGrath, “whether it’s Irish immigrants bringing their whiskey traditions with them to America or the romantic tales of bootlegged whiskey and moonshine in the Prohibition era.” ReutersHere comes the good stuff The big winners of late are those companies that specialize in brown spirits, such as Beam Inc., which makes Jim Beam, Maker’s Mark, Knob Creek, and Laphroaig, as well as Kentucky-based Brown Forman, which makes Jack Daniels. On June 4, Brown Forman said that fiscal fourth quarter sales rose 3.1 percent to $389 million, while earnings soared 17 percent to $132 million. And the company’s share price has followed, topping $90 a share after hitting a recent low of $66.50 in June 2013. The industry’s big players have taken note: In April, Japanese spirits company Suntory paid $16 billion to acquire Jim Beam. European liquor powerhouses Diageo and Pernod Ricard, which rely on white spirits for 71 and 81 percent of sales, respectively, aren’t feeling so flush. The stocks of both companies, which traded at a premium to Brown Forman on a price-earnings basis in 2007, now trade at a significant discount. Diageo shares have slid from a July 2013 high of more than £2,100 to £1,919 in early June, while Pernod Ricard shares have dropped from €100 in March 2013 to €89. In the 12 months ending in April, Diageo’s total sales of white spirits fell in all price categories. Sales by volume of the super premium gin Tanqueray fell 2.3 percent, Smirnoff dropped 5.9 percent, and Gordon’s Gin declined 3.2 percent, according to the National Alcohol Beverage Control Association. Likewise, sales of Pernod Ricard’s Absolut vodka fell 4.7 percent over the past 12 months. Some high-end vodka producers, including Bacardi’s Grey Goose, have even begun discounting their products. Neither Diageo nor Pernod Ricard reports quarterly results, but recent data suggest brown spirits are supporting their U.S. business as their white spirits are losing traction. Diageo reported 2 percent lower volume sales in North America in the second half of 2013 whereas sales of Bulleit bourbon and rye grew 60 percent. Company executives have also singled out Johnnie Walker for strong regional growth and on May 29 announced the purchase of a 300-acre property in Shelby County, Ky., where the company plans to build a $115 million, 1.8-million gallon whiskey distillery over the next three years. Pernod Ricard, which reported in April that U.S. sales volumes were up 4 percent for the first nine months of its fiscal year, relied on Jameson Irish whiskey (up 17 percent) to drive that growth. It should come as no surprise, then, that liquor companies are pulling out all the stops to capitalize on the popularity of brown spirits. Some firms are following vodka’s example and offering flavored versions of brown spirits, such as honey-flavored bourbons (Jim Beam) and cinnamon whiskies (Fireball Cinnamon Whiskey, owned by the firm Sazerac). And in April, Diageo launched a new whisky label, Haig’s Club, in conjunction with soccer star David Beckham. Of course, one never knows how long consumers will favor a particular tipple.

However, almost all of those strategists are convinced gains will be very modest. But in the past week, we've heard from a trio of pros who warn bad things could be coming. "Since 1875, we have never seen the S&amp;P rise for seven calendar years in a row, so an eighth year would seem highly unlikely," Societe Generale's Roland Kaloyan said in a Dec. 17 note to clients. "We assume that the S&amp;P 500 will finish the year slightly down as the strengthening of the US dollar and the new tightening cycle offset the strong US GDP growth already priced-in at the start of the year." "I have the same kind of feel in ’98 and ’99; also ’05 and ’06," Uber bear David Tice told CNBC. "This is going to end badly. I have every confidence in the world." Tice said that stocks are doomed to plunge by 30%-60%. But, he doesn't have much skin in the game as he's not actually shorting the market. Appaloosa Management's David Tepper, however, has lots of skin in the game. "This year rhymes with 1998," Tepper said to CNBC. "Russia goes bad. Easing [is] coming from Europe. Sets up 1999 ... [oops] I mean 2015... You [just] have to be aware of the possibility for some sort of overvaluation of the markets. And they are fair value now."

REUTERS/Yannis BehrakisSnap elections could have a huge impact on Europe if Syriza come to power. Greece's parliament just voted on the government's presidential candidate and didn't get the supermajority it needed. Snap elections are now coming Jan. 25, and Greece's stocks are going through the floor again. This was the third and final round of voting by Greek politicians — the government needed a supermajority to avoid the sudden elections. That meant it needed 180 of 300 MPs to approve Stavros Dimas, the candidate. The governing coalition has 155 MPs, and it persuaded another 13 to back Dimas in the last round. It needed another 12 in the latest round, and it didn't get a single extra one.  The Athens Stock Exchange is down by more than 8.4% as of 11 a.m. GMT, after falling 11% immediately after the vote. The far-left Syriza group seems likely to win the snap election less than a month from now. Since the presidential vote was announced in the first week of December, the Athens Stock Exchange has tumbled by more than a quarter.  investing.com, Business Insider Syriza isn't likely to be able to form a government on its own, but the highly unorthodox program it promotes suggests rolling back many of the reforms in recent years and scrapping bailout agreements with Greece's international lenders. It could be the first instance of a eurozone government that simply refuses to cooperate with the currency union's institutions. Greece's banks, which Syriza has suggested it will nationalize, are getting hit hardest in the stock sell-off. Piraeus Bank and Alpha Bank, two of the country's largest, are down more than 14%. There are now a couple of major issues. The first is whether Syriza's poll lead will hold up. In some surveys, its lead has been narrowing recently. Will voters get a little less radical as the election approaches? Even if Syriza wins, it remains to be seen what sort of coalition it could build to govern. There are also rumors that the government will try to abolish the 50-seat bonus that Greece's winning party usually gets. It isn't likely to be able to do that before the snap election, but if Greece has to go back to the polls afterward (not a rare occurrence), it could have a major impact.    FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersA Subway restaurant is pictured in San Diego, CaliforniaSHANGHAI (Reuters) - U.S. fast-food chain Subway is investigating media reports in China that workers at an outlet in Beijing doctored food labels and used produce beyond its expiry date, a Shanghai-based spokeswoman for the firm said on Monday. Chinese media reports that started circulating on Friday said workers at a Beijing outlet for Subway, which operates globally as a franchise business, changed expiry and production dates on meat, drink and vegetable produce to extend their use. "Our headquarters here is now investigating the matter," a Subway spokeswoman said. She said the firm had not reached any conclusions. "We want to investigate what caused the labeling issue and whether or not it was the action of a single franchised outlet." The issue highlights the difficulty firms have to control food quality and safety in supply chains and outlets in China, which can cause serious headaches with regulators and hit sales. Earlier this year, a China-based food supplier to McDonald's Corp and Yum Brands Inc was caught up in a scandal over workers allegedly tampering with expiry dates, which pummeled China sales at the fast-food chains. The Subway spokeswoman said the firm sent teams to inspect its franchises around the country each month and that it gave staff training on food safety and handling produce. The Beijing food regulator had also launched an investigation, she added. Food safety scandals in China are all too common, including recycled "gutter oil" for cooking, donkey meat products tainted with fox and one in 2008 involving tainted dairy products that led to the deaths of at least six infants. Subway, part of Doctor's Associate Inc, has close to 500 outlets in China, according to its official website.

Thomson ReutersLogo of Swiss bank Credit Suisse is seen below the Swiss national flag at a building in the Federal Square in BernZURICH (Reuters) - Credit Suisse Group AG  said on Monday it would fight a U.S. lawsuit which accuses the Swiss bank of deceiving investors in mortgage-backed securities it had issued. The Zurich-based bank said a New York State Supreme Court justice had last week rejected its request to dismiss the case, in which New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman accuses the bank of misrepresenting the quality of loans underlying residential mortgage-backed securities sponsored and underwritten by Credit Suisse in 2006 and 2007. Investors suffered $11.2 billion in losses on the securities, according to Schneiderman's lawsuit, which stems from a joint federal-state working group created by President Barack Obama to go after wrongdoing that led to the 2008 financial crisis. "We will appeal this particular decision and continue to defend ourselves in this case," a spokeswoman for Credit Suisse in Zurich said on Monday. The U.S. government's examination of financial crisis-era mortgage abuses is now Credit Suisse's biggest legal worry, after it in May set aside a years-long U.S. probe into its dealings with Americans evading taxes by pleading guilty to a criminal charge and agreeing to pay more than $2.5 billion in penalties. U.S.-based rivals including Bank of America Corp , JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co  and Citigroup Inc  have in recent months reached settlements with the U.S. government over charges they misled investors into buying troubled mortgage-backed securities. In October, Credit Suisse said it added a net 390 million Swiss francs ($395 million) to its litigation provisions in the third quarter, without saying what the provision was for.

REUTERS/Beawiharta AirAsia CEO Tony Fernandes has flown to the airport that the Singapore-bound flight set off from to take charge. AirAsia shares tumbled as markets opened in Malaysia on Monday, plunging by nearly 13% at the open and settling down 7.82%, after one of the company's aircraft carrying 162 passengers went missing over Indonesia on Sunday.  However, some analysts this morning are saying that the missing jet is unlikely to seriously damage the company in the long-term. Here's Morgan Stanley on the impact:  We think AirAsia's longer-term growth trajectory should remain on track. Firstly, we find comfort in a strong management team which has also been swift in its response to the accident. In addition, assuming fuel prices remain lower for longer, we think that fuel-cost savings could offset near-term impact from lower passenger yields and weaker demand. They're staying overweight AirAsia shares, meaning that they still expect it to be a pretty good investment going forward. AirAsia CEO Tony Fernandes has overseen the company's rapid expansion, beginning with two jets in 2002, and expanding to over 80 aircraft today, according to the Telegraph. Fernandes travelled to the airport that the plan initially departed from, and said that he is devastated by the news. The analysts also said that lessons could be learned from Malaysia Airlines' (MAS) experience: In March 2014, Malaysia Airlines lost contact with flight MH370. The plan was carrying hundreds of passengers and has still not been found: Domestic air traffic demand in Malaysia could face a bigger impact compared to international traffic for Malaysia AirAsia.Lessons gleaned from MAS over the past year suggest that domestic demand in Malaysia has tended to be more sensitive towards air travel safety while international demand has tended to be more price sensitive. Considering that c.60-70% of AirAsia's capacity is domestic focused, this incident may havea near term impact on operational profitability Morgan Stanley's projections estimate that earnings before tax will rise by about 40% from the 2013 fiscal year to 2016.  FREE AppDownload

(Reuters) - The board of American Apparel Inc has received a letter from British buyout firm Lion Capital, pushing it to explore strategic options include a sale, a source familiar with the situation said on Sunday. The letter also said that Lion Capital would nominate Lyndon Lea, one of its founders, to the clothing retailer's board of directors to replace one of its previous designees, Gene Montesano. Lion Capital, a former lender to the retailer, has the right to nominate two of American Apparel's nine board seats. Lea had previously been on the board but stepped down in 2011. Lion Capital also has warrants to purchase up to 12 percent of the retailer. The letter, which is being reviewed by the board, asks the board to form a special committee to evaluate options, according to the source, who asked not to be named because the matter is not public. Representatives for American Apparel and Lion Capital did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Irving Place Capital has put in a bid for the retailer for up to $1.40 a share, an offer that American Apparel's board believes is far too low, Reuters has reported. The Los Angeles-based company has been bogged down by debt and investigations into the conduct of former chief executive Dov Charney that had dragged out for months. Charney was fired on Dec. 16 after a six-month suspension and will be replaced by Paula Schneider, president of ESP Group Ltd. The Wall Street Journal first reported the news about Lion Capital's letter late Sunday. (Editing by Eric Walsh) FREE AppDownload
© AFP/File Christof StacheA national minimum wage comes into effect in Germany on January 1Berlin (AFP) - As the New Year approaches, Berlin bakery worker Jessica Arendt is not just looking forward to the fireworks. In 2015, she says, "I'll be able to afford a few more things". A national minimum wage comes into effect in Germany on January 1, and that means an additional one euro ($1.30) an hour for the 23-year-old. Mathias Moebius, a bakery chain owner, isn't quite so happy. He says he will have to put up prices in response. Chancellor Angela Merkel this year signed off on the country's first national minimum wage, an idea she had long opposed. In the past, Merkel favoured separate pay deals by industrial sector and region, arguing that a national minimum wage would harm many small- and medium-sized businesses and could force them to lay off workers. But her coalition partners, the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), were adamant that they would only enter into a power-sharing deal if Merkel and her conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) agreed to the fixed basic wage to help Germany's growing army of working poor. So, after long and tortuous negotiations, the two sides finally agreed to start phasing in a minimum wage from January 1.  Arendt will now receive 8.50 euros per hour before tax, one of around 3.7 million people the Federal Labour Agency predicts will see a fatter pay packet. REUTERS/Tobias Schwarz  For Moebius, whose bakery chain numbers some 45 stores in the eastern German state of Saxony, more than 300 employees will be affected.  Moebius acknowledged that it would be good for his workforce in principle. "It will bring the financial remuneration for working in a personnel-intensive sector like the food industry more into line with other sectors," he told AFP. "It may even improve the image of our industry." But for a family-run business like his, it would also mean a 10-percent rise in costs, which he would have to recoup elsewhere, he said. Economists argue that if there are price rises in other sectors, if taxis and hairdressers also put up their prices, then Arendt and the millions of other low-wage earners will soon find themselves out of pocket as quickly as before.  In Berlin, Ahmet, a 58-year-old taxi driver who is paid per ride, not by the hour, also expressed concern.  "I'll probably have to pay more taxes and welfare charges. So the effect on my pay will be negative rather than positive," he said.  According to a poll of 6,300 businesses across all sectors by the Ifo economic think-tank, 26 percent of employers affected by the new minimum wage plan to raise their prices; 23 percent plan to curb employee bonuses; and 22 percent to cut jobs.  Others plan to reduce investment or scale back employees' working hours.  The effects will be felt more sharply in eastern Germany, where wages have never been able to catch up with those in the west, even a quarter of a century after unification, economists said. But the minimum wage has many critics around the country, not just in the poorer east of Germany. "The minimum wage jeopardises thousands of jobs in Bavaria, increases labour costs and weighs on both companies and taxpayers by creating additional bureaucracy," complained Bertram Brossardt of the regional employers' federation in the wealthy southern state. The DIHK federation of chambers of commerce calculates that 200,000 jobs could face the chop nationwide.  But the labour agency's president Frank-Juergen Weise was less alarmist.  "I don't believe there will be massive job cuts," he said recently. In Saxony, Moebius said he had no immediate plans to slash jobs or shut stores. But, he warned, "I can't rule that out in future," adding that it will probably be unskilled workers who would find it more difficult to find new work.  Many economists agreed, even if the large majority acknowledge that it will take years before the real economic consequences on the minimum can be fully gauged.  Nevertheless, Yen, a 20-year-old who is currently paid 7.0 euros per hour for working on a food stall in a Berlin shopping mall, says it will bring her closer to her dream of one day travelling to Australia.  "I'll continue to save hard," she said.
