We forecast a low double-digit gain of 10 â€“ 15% for U.S. stocks in 2014, as measured by the S&amp;P 500 Index. This forecast for a slightly above-average annual return is rooted in our expectations for high single-digit earnings growth and a modest rise in the PE ratio. Additionally, we expect similar performance for international stocks. An improvement in economic growth to an average 3% pace in 2014 should drive solid profit gains and boost confidence in the durability of growth. Importantly, GDP does not have to be booming to produce solid gains in the stock market, as 2013 can attest. In fact, there is little relationship between the magnitude of GDP growth and stock market performance. Strong GDP can be a sign of an overheating economy that may be due for a recession, and weak GDP may be discounted by the stock market ahead of an actual turnaround. Since WWII, U.S. GDP of plus or minus 1% around the longterm average of 3% has produced an average gain of 16% in the S&amp;P 500 and produced a positive return 83% of the time. The risk to our forecast is from growth disappointing our expectations, not from policymakers derailing the recovery. A key lesson from 2013 is that the stock market and economy can overcome many challenges by policymakers, including the fiscal cliff tax increases, the sequester spending cuts, the Fed tapering concerns, and the shutdown and debt ceiling brinkmanship. But a better pace of growth must materialize; just more bond buying by the Fed is not enough to lift valuations from current levels to propel further gains. LPL Financial Looking BackSome may fear an outsized gain in the stock market during 2013, is surely to be punished with losses in the coming year. However, historically after a one-year total return in the 25 â€“ 30% range, the S&amp;P 500 has followed it up by more solid years of gains. In fact, the average return in a year following a 25 â€“ 30% gain was 12%, and stocks posted a double-digit gain in four of the five occurrences (the exception was 1961â€™s gain of 26.9%, which was followed by a loss of 8.7% in 1962) [Figure 4]. In fact, most of the years were actually followed by several years of strong gains, as was the case in 1943, 2003, and 2009. Earnings GrowthWe expect more businesses will benefit from the improving trend in global economic data, which should help boost confidence in future earnings growth. Most notably, the widely followed ISM Purchasing Managersâ€™ Index has a solid track record of forecasting earnings growth in coming quarters [Figure 5]. This indicator suggests a rebound from the sluggish performance of earnings and revenues in 2013. LPL Financial Given 3 â€“ 4% global GDP and inflation of 1 â€“ 2% in 2014 driving sales growth for S&amp;P 500 companies of about 5%, in conjunction with the benefit of ongoing buybacks and profit margin expansion, we expect earnings per share (EPS) growth of 5 â€“ 10% in 2014. From our perspective, Wall Street analystsâ€™ consensus estimate for earnings growth of 11% in 2014 may again be too high, since it would require a combination of even stronger economic growth and profit margin expansion beyond what are already record levels. Valuation ExpansionWith only about 5% earnings growth in 2013, but a 26% gain in the S&amp;P 500 Index (not including dividends) through mid-November 2013, it was clearly a year driven by rising valuation, as the rise in the PE did most of the lifting of the index. We expect the PE for the S&amp;P 500 to continue to rise in 2014, though not as much as in 2013. The rise in valuation in 2013 to about 16 was primarily a reversal of the PE contraction in 2011 and 2012, as the PE fell from around 15 at the end of 2010 to 13 in 2011 and ended 2012 at about 14. As the risk of a return to recession subsided and confidence in the durability of growth improved, the PE returned to average, as the economy kept growing despite all of the hits it took from fiscal cliff tax increases, sequester spending cuts, European bank bailouts, and Fed tapering concerns, among many others. As the economy accelerates in 2014 and earnings grow more rapidly, the PE is likely to rise further. Alternatively, if economic growth falters and earnings do not move higher, we would expect a modest drop in the PE and a decline for the stock market, despite more bond buying from the Fed. The market has become increasingly more sensitive to growth over policy. And it is the direction of growth, much more than magnitude, that matters. Remember that the Fedâ€™s third round of bond buying, or QE3, announced in September 2012, failed to boost stocks until January 2013, when growth started to improve after the fourth quarter of 2012â€™s GDP growth rate of just 0.1%. While stock indexes like the S&amp;P 500 have hit all-time highs, the stocks are not currently valued at the levels that have marked the end of bull markets in the past. The PE for S&amp;P 500 companies using EPS over the past four quarters stands at about 16 as 2013 draws to a close. This is below the 17 â€“ 18 PE where every secular and cyclical bull market has ended since WWII (with the exception of the late 1990s that ended much higher). We expect the PE for the S&amp;P 500 to end 2014 around 16.5 â€” a level last seen in 2005 and 2006. A rise of half a point seems reasonable based upon last yearâ€™s experience as risks receded and our expectation for growth to improve in the coming year. The rise in valuation contributes 0 â€“ 5% to our 10 â€“ 15% return forecast. The Bull ContinuesWhile stocks reacted negatively in 2013 when interest rates shot up sharply on fear of a premature end to the Fedâ€™s bond-buying program, in general, stocks can go up even when bond yields rise â€” as we expect them to in 2014. Bull and bear market trends over the past 63 years reveal that the environment we foresee is most like that of the 1950s, when stocks were in a bull market while bonds and cash were in bear markets [Figure 6]. While the current market combination is rare, it is not unheard of â€” nor has it been a fleeting or fragile combination. For nearly the entire decade of the 1950s, stocks remained in an upward-trending, secular bull market while bonds and cash were mainly in a bear market. LPL Financial Bond yields may continue to rise in the coming years as the Fed ends the bond-buying program and GDP growth and inflation accelerate, maintaining the bear market for bonds. At the same time, the Fed may likely keep cash yields pinned down, with no interest rate hikes likely for at least a year or two, maintaining the bear market for cash. However, we are likely to avoid the ugly triple-bear markets of the late 1970s, where soaring inflation weighed heavily on stocks, bonds, and cash. Broadening GrowthNowhere were the effects of the Fedâ€™s message on tapering felt more acutely in 2013 than in the worldâ€™s emerging markets (EM). The MSCI Emerging Market Index is down 4% for the year through mid-November 2013 compared with a more than 25% gain for U.S. stocks. Much of that weakness came following the Fedâ€™s May 22, 2013 communication on its intention to taper its bond-buying program, with EM stocks falling about 15% during the following month. In addition, many EM currencies depreciated as investors pulled their money â€” echoing the start of the currency crises in Mexico in 1994 and Asian emerging markets in 1997, which were devastating to EM investors. Similar to the environment that preceded the July start of the 1997 â€“ 98 Asian financial crisis, U.S. economic growth has prompted the Fed to consider reducing monetary stimulus. The Fedâ€™s talk of tapering draws a comparison to the Fed rate hike of March 1997. Then, as now, the threat of reduced global liquidity created a headwind for emerging market countries and acted as a weight on the relative performance of EM stocks versus U.S. stocks. However, unlike 1997, these countries have not been creating debt-fueled bubbles in their economies. And their smaller deficits, larger foreign currency reserves, debt denominated in local currency, and flexible exchange rates are positives likely to help avoid another emerging market crisis. Chasing ReturnsWhile corporations are again likely to remain buyers of their stocks in the coming year, 2014 may finally be the year individual investors, as a group, begin to buy stocks in contrast to the net selling they have done since the bull market began nearly five years ago. The five-year trailing annualized return for stocks has been weak, especially compared to bonds, in recent years. However, as 2014 gets underway, the one-, three-, and five-year trailing annualized returns for the S&amp;P 500 will all be in the double digits for the first time this business cycle. Our analysis of history shows that it is the five-year return that individual investors tend to chase, based on net inflows to U.S. stock funds. As of March 6, 2014, five years from the bear market low in the S&amp;P 500 â€” even assuming no additional growth in the stock market between now and then â€” the five-year annualized return may have exceeded bondsâ€™ 5% return by 20%. This may prompt many investors to reconsider the role of stocks in their portfolios, especially as interest rates rise and bond performance lags. With long-term interest rates remaining historically low, corporate earnings likely to grow in the high single digits, job growth improving, and inflation remaining below 3%, conditions are ripening for stocks to reward investors in 2014.
FlickrThanksgiving is on Thursday so it's about that time when you start fretting about how you talk to your relatives about public affairs. Most people are worried about debates over Obamacare. Wonkblog's Sarah Kliff gives a rundown on how to navigate those. But there's a more pressing issue that is sure to light up dinner table discussion and create all sorts of mayhem: the Fed's taper! Here's your guide for how to handle those conversations: What is tapering? Let's start of with the basics. The Federal Reserve has been using an unconventional monetary policy tool called quantitative easing (QE) to spur economic growth since the Fed has already cut short term rates, the tool it normally uses to fight recession, to zero. This is the third round of QE and has been in place since September of last year when the Fed announced it would buy $40 billion of mortgage-backed securities. In December, it began buying an additional $45 billion of long-term Treasuries. The goal of these asset purchases is to bring down long-term interest rates by removing supply from the market. As the economy has recovered in the past 15 months, the Fed has begun considering when it would start reducing its purchases. That's called tapering. So, that's what tapering is. Does anyone know when the Fed is going to stop? Nope. No one knows for sure, not even Ben Bernanke or Janet Yellen. Back in June, Bernanke announced that if the economy continued improving at a moderate pace, that the taper would happen sometime in the latter half of the year. Over the summer, the recovery slowed slightly, mortgage rates rose and the potential for a government shutdown grew. The Fed surprised the market in September when it postponed the taper.Â  Right now, no one is certain when the taper will come. Many believe it will happen in March in Janet Yellen's first FOMC meeting as chairman while others believe it will occur in December during Bernanke's final meeting. Much of it will depend on the upcoming economic data, specifically the November jobs report. Wait, I thought the market has a good read on these things. Why was it so surprised in September? There are mixed opinions on this. Many blame the Fed's communication strategy and argue that it led the market to believe that a taper was coming in September. Others, including Bernanke himself, think that the Fed followed the baseline policy that it laid out in June. They say that the Fed informed the market that a taper was coming if the underlying economic data continued to come in at a continued pace. Since it came in below that level, it's not surprising that the Fed postponed tapering. OK got it. I've heard a lot of people argue that QE is going to cause rampant inflation. Is that true? Are we about to see prices skyrocket? Nope. Many economists have spent the past few years predicting that inflation is right around the corner. They argue that the Fed has pumped trillions of dollars into the money supply and that this will undoubtedly lead to inflation. Except that hasn't happened. Inflation has been persistently below the Fed's 2% target the past few years, despite those dire warnings. In fact, some commentators are starting to become more worried about deflation than inflation after CPI came in at just 1.0% year over year rate in October and core CPI, which is prices minus food and energy, came in at 1.7%. Quite simply, there are no signs that inflation is around the corner. Alright, that's comforting at least. What about unemployment? Is the economy improving? Yes, but slowly. The October jobs report, which was distorted a bit by the government shutdown, showed stronger job growth than we have seen in a while. The housing market looks like it is still improving despite rising mortgage rates over the summer. Retail sales and GDP growth both came in above expectations as well. However, expectations have been low so beating them was not difficult. The economy is still recovering at a slow pace and it would be years until we reached full employment. Well there goes my comfort. Is there anything that can make me feel optimistic? Well, things could be a lot worse. Just look at Europe. The ECB has been much slower to cut rates and have not used any unconventional tools like the Fed has done with quantitative easing. That has lead to a miserably slow recovery that is still way behind yours. As for back here, the economy is slowly getting better and it doesn't look we'll have another government shutdown. If that doesn't cut it for you, then check out Steven Perlberg's guide for how to drink on Thanksgiving. That always makes dinner table arguments much more fun.
With every other bear throwing in the towel left and right these days, we fully expected that the latest letter by SocGen's Albert Edwards would have something about "how much he hates looking at himself in the mirror, but..." and then we would be served with some garbage like the following margin expectations chart. www.zerohedge.com Luckily none of that happened. Instead we were greeted by the sharp insight and keen intellect that we have grown to expect from AE, and that have disappeared from the repertoire of so many other sellouts and lemming cheerleaders. Ironically, the topic of Edwards' latest piece is precisely the chart above — the explosion in future margins, or rather the complete lack thereof. In fact, what Edwards is seeing is quite the opposite. To wit: The margin squeeze that is unfolding as unit labour costs climb above company selling price inflation... Albert Edwards   ... leaves the economy extremely vulnerable to a downturn in the investment cycle. Business output inflation is measuring a wider basket of goods and services than the Fed?s favoured measure of inflation, the core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) deflator, but it does move in a very similar fashion (see chart below). Low pricing power is leaving the US economy more vulnerable than many suppose. In my view, a full-blown profits and investment downturn is most likely to be triggered by Asian and EM devaluations releasing surplus capacity onto the West and crushing pricing power even further. As Ian Harwood, my former boss used to say, ?"Watch the profit cycle closely. We ignore it at our peril?." This is a useful follow up to our earlier observations on the current status of the leverage cycle, when we noted that while the business cycle may be dead, but if it isn't we are now on the verge, if not have entered a full-blown recession. We have, on these pages, long believed that corporate profits should be watched closely, not for their direct impact on equity valuations, but their impact on the economic cycle. Most economic models have profits dropping out as a residual, but they are a key driver of the economic cycle. Growth in profits determines the growth of investment, inventories and employment. (Note I emphasis the growth, and not the level, of profits or the rate of profitability). Over the years I have tended to focus on US pre-tax domestic non-financial profits as a best lead indicator for US-based company business spending. In the chart below I show this profits measure together with real growth in business investment, including inventories. Profits growth typically leads investment spending. Albert Edwards If we can get a handle on the profits cycle we can avoid being caught out by the investment cycle and recessions. Typically it was said that ?recessions were made in Washington? as the Fed jacked up rates to fight inflation. This not only curbed the credit cycle but squeezed corporate profits to the point that it triggered a downswing in the investment cycle and ?caused? a recession. So in many investors? minds a recession will not occur unless the Fed triggers one with monetary tightening. That is of course nonsense. A credit bubble can burst without any monetary tightening and similarly the profit cycle can turn down due to a variety of factors. This is a critical observation, one that everyone ignores, and one which as the first two charts above show, means that unless the Fed proceeds to inject funds directly into corporate revenues (there is a reason why revenues will have declined for 3 quarters in a row), one can kiss not only the idiotic hockeystick forecast margin chart goodbye, but that negative margins, and earnings, are just around the horizon. Edwards' conclusion is simple: if the US economy continues on the current track, an economic decline is inevitable, which in turn will crush confidence in the Fed, and make future monetary policy prohibitively costly: ... a recession seems a distant prospect in the minds of most investors. Yet one key precursor for a recession has now fallen into place. Slowing productivity growth means that unit labour costs are now running well ahead of output price inflation. This means a margin and profits downturn is now about to unfold. That typically is a key precursor of recession. Finally, for those who are will be quick to acuse Edwards of crying wolf, he has a few words for you too:
Apple App StoreThe winter holidays are upon us, which means many traders and investors will be away from their workstations. So, what to do for those who want to keep tabs on what's going on overseas â€” where markets will be open for business as usual? Luckily, investors with smartphones or tablets have their choice of apps to keep them up to speed while away from their desks. We went through nearly 100 finance-related mobile apps and these are the best ones we found. Most of the apps listed here are either free or pretty inexpensive, too.
Flickr/Niels LinnebergFA Insights is a daily newsletter from Business Insider that delivers the top news and commentary for financial advisors. It's A Myth That Index Funds Can Become 'Tax Traps' During A Bear Market (Vanguard) It is often claimed that index mutual funds — funds that are created to replicate of an index — can become a tax trap during bear markets when fund managers are forced to sell their holdings and distribute profits in the form of capital gains. But Scott Donaldson of Vanguard's Investment Strategy Group dismisses the argument as a myth.  "Typically, an index fund in practice carries a wide dispersion of share lots in each security — that is, groups of shares purchased at different prices, both high and low — that serve as a powerful defense against the risk that such portfolios will become 'tax traps'." "...It's important to understand that a broad-market index fund has the ability to sell share lots that were purchased at high prices and realize losses that can then be used to offset gains elsewhere in the portfolio," Donaldson said. "Thus, a well-managed index fund can use its high-cost share lots (those purchased at high prices) to accommodate redemption requests. As a result, redemptions during a bear market can actually help a broad-market index fund remain tax-efficient." HOWARD MARKS: Heed This Omen, The Risks Of 2007 Are Back (Oaktree Capital) Oak Tree Capital's Howard Marks thinks "we’re seeing another upswing in risky behavior." This he says was "spurred  by central bank policies that depressed the return on safe investments." Marks says he sees the same characteristics now that he saw in 2007 before the financial crisis, though not to the same degree. These risks include 1. Global glut of liquidity. 2. Very little interest in traditional investments and investors are moving towards alternative investments. 3. Little concern about taking on risk. 4. Meager prospective returns.  "In short, it’s my belief that when investors take on added risks – whether because of increased optimism or because they’re coerced to do so (as now) – they often forget to apply the caution they should," Marks writes. "That’s bad for them. But if we’re not cognizant of the implications, it can also be bad for the rest of us." Advisors Should Tell Their Clients About Donor Advised Funds (The Wall Street Journal)  Charitable giving is something affluent clients often care about yet advisors pay very little attention to donor advised funds (DAFs), writes Mark R. Mersman, financial advisor at Michigan-based USA Financial in a new WSJ column. Clients can set up a DAF and the put money into it and take a tax write off for the amount they have donated. They then tell the fund where to donate the money.  But that isn't the only benefit of the DAF. "Instead of collecting tax receipts from multiple organizations, clients can collect one tax receipt for the DAF and still contribute to multiple charities," writes Mersman. "Also, clients can let the fund sit and grow indefinitely, meaning they don't need to grant funds to charities immediately if they aren't ready." But advisors should also warn their clients about the costs associated with DAFs and point out that they give up control once the donation is made. Stocks Are Outyielding Bonds Everywhere (BlackRock) Investors chasing yield have been in a tight spot as government bonds and money market funds have delivered negative returns after accounting for inflation, according to BlackRock. But yields on international stocks are higher than those of government bonds. BlackrockBURTON MALKIEL: Investors Sticking To The 60/40 Rule Are Likely To Get Badly Hurt (CNBC) Investors that stuck with the 60% stock and 40% bond portfolio model saw returns of 10% a year from 1990-2011, according to Elizabeth MacBride at CNBC. But that strategy might have lost its usefulness. Burt Malkiel, CIO of Wealthfront told CNBC that bond investors will be badly hurt. "The correct allocation ought to depend on individual circumstances. It is definitely not the right kind of thing for everybody. What I had in my "Random Walk" for the last several editions is a quite different allocation. You should have more equity orientation. Another rule of thumb: Jack Bogle has often said bonds should be a percentage equal to your age. I don't agree with that, either. "I think that allocation is particularly wrong today because we are in an age of financial repression. ... Europe and Japan are having trouble reining in budget deficits, and we have high debt in the U.S., too. (The governments) are deliberately keeping interest rates down. Even a U.S. bond index fund is not the right thing to do, because BND [Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF] is about two-thirds government or agency bonds."

Terren in Virginia via FlickrAs a kid, I remember the Apollo lunar module losing all communication for about one hour as it orbited around the back of the moon. We all held our breath for that hour, waiting to hear that all was okay.*Â  That is what happens with the housing market each winter. Sales slow during the holiday season and don't pick back up until the sun shines. That sun shines brightest first in Arizona and Florida, which is where we will be turning our attention in January as the first indicator of 2014's housing market.Â  The Cool Fall This winter provides the most angst in several years, as the last three months have been characterized by slowing sales and a rising percentage of greedy sellers dropping price to generate activity. I call some sellers greedy because none of them envisioned one year ago that they would be asking so much for their house today. This also sounds a lot better than price declines. Slowing sales have had three causes at their root:Â  Before the slowdown, I was expressing extreme concern that the market was getting overheated, as I was seeing flippers (and hard money debt available to flippers) reemerge. This slowdown should temper flipping.Â  Interesting Twists In short posts like this, I don't have time to go into the details of our outlook, so let me just add a few additional things to ponder over the holiday season:Â  An Objective Index We have all sorts of tools we use to bring clarity to our housing outlook, and one of my favorites is our Housing Cycle Risk Indexâ„¢ (HCRI), which is a purely mathematical look at how 25 indicators of demand, supply, affordability, and confidence stack up today against history in each market area. At a high level, you need to know three things:Â Â  The current spot on the HCRIâ„¢ is shown in the graphic below. Most markets have A and B ratings and are trending down because affordability and supply were both better early in the year. This means that now is a great time to invest, although with far more caution than earlier in the year. That is not a blanket statement, however, as prices have moved much faster than the fundamentals, and it is easy to overpay. John Burns Real Estate Consulting What Does It All Mean? Our view on 2014 is in line with the consensus view that the economy is most likely to continue growing at its current pace, new home supply will continue to grow at a 15%+ clip but remain far below normal levels, and mortgage rates should remain in the 4.5% range. If that is the case, and there are no exogenous shocks from our leadership or elsewhere, demand will continue to exceed supply, and affordability will continue to be better than usual in most markets. This should give rise to a healthy housing market in 2014. Let's all hold our breath. *I am borrowing this excellent analogy from Ara Hovnanian, CEO of K. Hovnanian.
Noah LuisEditor's note: We originally ran this piece Nov. 25. Since then, the price of Litecoin has skyrocketed approximately 400% to more than $25. We've updated it to reflect price changes. At more than $900, the price of Bitcoin is now so great that it threatens to shut out some mainstream users. You may be wondering whether there were ever any mainstream users in the first place. But Charlie Lee, a former Googler and MIT grad, recognized such an audience did exist. In 2011, two years after the birth of Bitcoin, the former Googler and MIT grad decided to create a version of Bitcoin that would make it more accessible. He called it Litecoin. "I think Satoshi [Nakamoto, Bitcoin's pseudonymous creator] is great, and Bitcoin is awesome," Lee said in a recent interview with BI. "I didn't fix Bitcoin. I just made small changes that made [Litecoin] a little bit better." Litecoin is not the only digital currency to have mounted Bitcoin’s virtual coattails. Coinmarketcap lists about two-dozen ones who’ve seen their prices increase in the past few months. But Litecoin appears to be the first among these secondary equals, something reflected in its $670 million market cap — nearly 8x greater than the next largest currency, Peercoin.  If you're at all familiar with Litecoin, you've probably heard it described, by Lee or others, as "silver to Bitcoin's gold." But if you don't believe Bitcoin is worth much in the first place, that may mean nothing to you. So we asked Lee to elaborate, and he made a convincing case for where Litecoin will fit into the for-now expanding realm of digital currency. "It's more abundant, and more lightweight" than Bitcoin, he says.  Here's what that means. Only 21 million Bitcoin will ever get created, and it's projected that won't occur until 2040. Although in theory this has no practical effect on its value if the Bitcoin economy truly takes off thanks to demand remaining consistent, that fixed amount will help keep prices elevated.  Lee designed Litecoin so that 84 million units would be created. And if the Litecoin economy scales up to where Bitcoin evangelists insist Bitcoin should be, the same pseudo-scarcity effect could someday be seen in Litecoin prices. In addition, Litecoin is not subject to the “arms race” currently seen among Bitcoin miners looking to corner the market on acquiring large amounts of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is built around hash cryptography that is supposed to get more complex — and thus require more expensive computing power to mine — as the Bitcoin economy expands and grows in value. But this has allowed individuals with more efficient computer chips — in other words, ones that require less electricity power to mine a given amount of Bitcoin — to get the jump on more conventional miners. Litecoin eliminates that advantage by using an entirely different cryptography program, called Scrypt, where the limiting factor is memory, not processing efficiency. That means you'd have to buy a greater quantity of computer hardware to beat the program, not just design a better chip. “There will be less of a cartel of miners,” Lee says. Finally, Lee says Litecoin transactions enjoy faster "confirmation" times. For a Bitcoin transaction to be completely processed, it must receive a number of confirmations from other users who've located the transfer on the Bitcoin's master ledger, the Blockchain. This usually takes about 10 minutes. That doesn't mean you have to wait around at a cash register if you're using Bitcoin to pay for groceries, as we have documented. But those transactions depend on temporary confirmations. With Litecoin, Lee says, confirmations take just two-and-a-half minutes. So although the odds of a temporary confirmation not being confirmed on the Blockchain are minuscule, Litecoin eliminates the problem entirely. So maybe it's better to understand Litecoin as "silver" in the medieval sense of the word: designed to be carried around in your virtual pocket for daily transactions. "If Litecoin truly succeeds, people will be using it for everyday purchases, and Bitcoin for large purposes," Lee says. Digital currency users appear to have grasped Litecoin's utility relatively swiftly. It's now worth more than $25, a 400% gain in just a week.  Lee estimates Litecoin is about two years behind in both price and adoption. Right now the online retail outlets taking Litecoin are somewhat limited, though will surely grow with the price of Litecoin. But, he says, Bitcoin itself is still decades away from reaching its full potential. "It's still in an inflationary stage," he says. "Once that stops, in 2040, that's when that's when things get interesting." 
In the past week, Bitcoin prices have climbed as much as 80%. We just told you why another cryptocurrency, Litecoin, has been able to ride Bitcoin's digital coattails to a 400% gain over the same period.Â  But Litecoin is not alone.Â There are at least 30 other digital currencies vying for relevancy in 2013.Â The best list of the full galaxy of digital currencies comes from CoinMarketCap.com. According to that site, Peercoin, which now has the third-largest market cap among digital currencies, is up 22% in the past 24 hours. Peercoin's main feature is that it's based on a protocol which, though different from Litecoin's, achieves the same effect of preempting mining cartels from forming and gaining too much control over prices. Namecoin, with the fourth-largest market cap, is up 70% in the past 24 hours. Its principal attribute is that it exists outside the regular Internet and therefore beyond control of The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN),Â the Internet's regulatory body. As you can see, the gains among the rest have been similarly parabolic. Â  Â  Â  CoinMarketCap This is just the top part of the page; we'll leave it up to you to explore the rest.Â 
 Paul Solman:Â On Friday's NewsHour,Â we looked at the stock marketÂ in light of the Dow-Jones Industrial Average ending the week atop 16,000, a new record. (Watch the segment above). Our main protagonist was Wall Street money manager Doug Dachille, who has appeared on this page numerous times, at greatest length when he explained why the much-hypedÂ LIBOR "scandal" was not as big a dealÂ as some had made it out to be. Doug, trained as a medical doctor, switched to finance and eventually ran proprietary trading for JP Morgan before starting his own firm, First Principles Capital Management, in 2003. It now manages more than $9 billion. And the CEO is nothing if not outspoken. During the course of our interview, he questioned the Fed's role in inflating the stock market and, as evidence of asset inflation far and wide, pointed to the advent of peer-to-peer lending over the Internet. I asked him to expand for our readers. Doug Dachille:Â What history has demonstrated is that while the name of the financial instruments responsible for financial crises always seem to change, the root causes are the same: poor credit underwriting standards, the excessive use of leverage, classic agency problems (lack of economic skin in the game) and the power of group thinking pushing the belief that this time, things will be different and financial alchemy has somehow produced real instead of fool's gold. If you reflect on some of the causes of the recent financial crisis, the parallels to peer-to-peer lending are striking. During the recent crisis, lenders extended credit with limited or no documentation. Loan originators and underwriters had far too little economic skin in the game. Investors relied far too much on the risk analysis coming from elsewhere in the investment decision process -- mainly bond credit ratings. Diversification was just an illusion -- unfortunately it is hard to diversify rampant fraud risk linked to loan originators and borrowers. Remarkably, peer-to-peer lending has all of those key ingredients. So, how is it possible that history can repeat so soon? As I like to say, history repeats itself when all those who can recall history are history. Yet peer-to-peer lending adds a twist to this phenomenon by simply bypassing the lenders who recently experienced history and instead going to those who have not. In peer-to-peer lending, lenders are provided limited financial documentation about the borrower. The lending clubs laud the benefits of diversification, and the clubs provide the equivalent of credit ratings for each borrower to aid the lender in determining the appropriate loan rate to compensate for "risk". Do the founders and the board members of these lending clubs have any economic skin in each of the loans that are posted on the websites? Doesn't this sound all too familiar? The recent financial crisis should have taught investors not to be over-reliant on third-party credit ratings when making investment decisions. There is no substitute for independent credit analysis. Yet in the case of peer-to-peer lending, lenders are dependent on the credit ratings from the lending club's proprietary models to decide to extend a loan and the rate to accept. There is no way for a lender to independently evaluate the plausibility of the proprietary borrower's credit rating posted on the website. Instead, lenders rely on blind faith and past credit performance history. Of course, given the short history of borrower performance on peer-to-peer loans, it would be impossible to determine with any statistical reliability that the credit rating categories are strongly correlated to the credit performance of the respectively rated loans. But consistent with the group thinking encountered in the past, no one is challenging their reliability. If professional credit officers and investment managers were duped in the previous financial crisis into making loans to borrowers that were supposedly "AAA", when in reality it was all junk, what chance does a retiree with no credit analysis experience have of avoiding the pitfalls of lending? Now a retiree is empowered by these peer-to-peer lending sites to become a senior lending officer, making loans with his retirement savings to borrowers he has never met, relying on an unproven credit rating metric and comforted by thinking that diversification will neutralize the impact of all his lending errors. He is also comforted by the thought that many of his other retired friends have also made loans to the same borrowers. General experience with email has proven that folks are willing to say things in electronic form that they would never consider saying in a face-to-face interaction. So, would it be a stretch of the imagination to consider that borrowers may approach loan repayment differently when they've gotten those loans over the Internet from nameless and faceless investors? And what lessons did investors learn about the benefits of diversification when every individual security in a "diversified" portfolio of sub-prime mortgage securities was valued at cents on the dollar? So, what is the major financial innovation of peer-to-peer lending given its remarkable similarity to the foolish lending practices of the recent crisis? The innovation is not the loan product itself. Instead, the key innovation of peer-to-peer lending rests with finding a new set of lenders. And given the current lack of income generated by traditional fixed income investments, there are a lot of investors looking for alternatives that offer a higher rate of return. First, it is important to remember that finding borrowers is never the hard part of the loan origination business, especially one geared toward making loans to people with poor credit histories; they're always in bountiful supply. The critical ingredient to growing a lending business is to expand the universe of parties willing to make loans to the weakest credits based upon the most liberal credit standards. This was the key element that drove the growth of sub-prime lending leading to the financial crisis. And this is the key innovation behind the growth of peer-to-peer lending. The lender in a peer-to-peer loan is not an experienced bank credit officer who's learned from years of making bad loans. Those experiences reduce the likelihood that he will make similar errors in the future. Nor is the lender a professional investment manager with credit analysis experience gained the hard way. Over-relying on credit ratings and believing that diversification mitigated risk when making non-traditional loans would have taught him a lesson. Unfortunately, it was a lesson learned on his investors' dime. Yet he is unlikely to commit those same errors in the future. In short, the recent experiences among these traditional lenders have likely resulted in appropriately more stringent credit standards for loans to unproven borrowers, limiting growth of the lending business. So where do you turn to grow a lending business when there is plenty of demand for loans by credit-impaired borrowers yet the supply of capital to make such loans by traditional lenders is prudently limited? Empower inexperienced lenders to make these loans. These new folks likely have not yet learned the mistakes you can make in the lending business. And the websites make it seem so easy to make a loan and to construct a diversified portfolio of investments offering an attractive rate of interest in a world that has become income deprived. Another unintended, or perhaps intended, consequence of monetary policy!
Screenshot via Bloomberg TVIn 2007, Oak Tree Capital's Howard Marks wrote the following warning: Todayâ€™s financial market conditions are easily summed up:Â  Thereâ€™s a global glut of liquidity, minimal interest in traditional investments, little apparent concern about risk, and skimpy prospective returns everywhere.Â  Thus, as the price for accessing returns that are potentially adequate (but lower than those promised in the past), investors are readily accepting significant risk in the form of heightened leverage, untested derivatives and weak deal structures. Marks didn't say when or what exactly would happen. Though the inevitable turn-for-the-worse outcome, he wrote at the time, had "little mystery." Did Marks "predict" the financial crisis? Not exactly, but dang if he wasn't close. In a new note today, Marks argues "weâ€™re seeing another upswing in risky behavior." "It began surprisingly soon after the crisisÂ spurred on by central bank policies that depressed the return on safe investments," he writes to clients. "It has gathered steam ever since, but not to anywhere near the same degree as in 2006-07." How does Marks know? Here's his "characteristics of 2007" checklist. From the note: Sure, investors aren't quite as risk-blind as 2007, but "when risk aversion declines and the pursuit of return gathers steam, issuers can do things in the capital markets that are impossible in more prudent times." "In short, itâ€™s my belief that when investors take on added risks â€“ whether because of increased optimism or because theyâ€™re coerced to do so (as now) â€“ they often forget to apply the caution they should," Marks concludes. "Thatâ€™s bad for them. But if weâ€™re not cognizant of the implications, it can also be bad for the rest of us."
Litecoin, the digital currency otherwise known as, "the silver to Bitcoin's gold," has surpassed $25 in value, reaching as much as $28.50. It's up 400% in the past week. We profiled Litecoin earlier this week. Its creator, Charlie Lee, an MIT grad and former Googler, designed Litecoin in 2011 to be used for everyday transactions as the price of Bitcoin climbs, as well as to thwart a cartel of miners from cornering the market. Â  "I think Satoshi [Nakamoto, Bitcoin's pseudonymous creator] is great, and Bitcoin is awesome," Lee told us. "I didn't fix Bitcoin. I just made small changes that made [Litecoin] a little bit better." Here's the chart: CryptoCoinCharts
REUTERS/Jason LeeChina announced that it would loosen its decades old one-child policy at the third plenum. Couples will be allowed to have more than one child if at least one of them is an only child.  Not only did the policy exacerbate labor shortages, it also skewed China's sex ratio. "China’s demographic dividend is gradually turning into a deficit, adding headwinds to underlying growth momentum," write Morgan Stanley's Yuande Zhu, Helen Qiao, and Yin Zhang. We picked out 8 key charts from Morgan Stanley that show how the demographics of the nation have changed and what it means for China's economy. 1. China has had three baby booms since the People's Republic was founded in 1949. The first was in the post-war period between 1949-1958. The second boom came after the great famine and lasted from 1962-1972. The last boom came in decade from 1981-1991 as "the second generation of baby boomers entered childbearing age, the high base naturally pushed the birth rate to a higher level." Morgan Stanley 2. China's fertility rate fell from 5.5 in 1970, to 1.6 by 2012. Meanwhile the birth rate fell from 33 per 1,000 in 1970, to 12 by 2012.  Morgan Stanley 3. The population growth rate fell from a high of 2.6% year-over-year in 1970 to 1.2% YoY in 1980. Morgan Stanley 4. China's population growth is set to decline from here and contract from 2030 on. Post-war baby boomers have already entered retirement age, which Zhu says is speeding up China's aging process. Morgan Stanley 5. The working age population is expected to decline as early as 2017, which is more significant for the economy. Morgan Stanley 6. Companies are having a harder time hiring employees despite the economic slowdown. Morgan Stanley 7. While the one-child policy was created to alleviate population pressures on the economy, it skewed the gender ratio towards boys.  Morgan Stanley8. People typically save while they work and spend post-retirement. "The economic structure will skew towards consumption rather than investment," as China's total dependency ratio begins to turn and baby boomers begin retiring.

Jonathan FultonCrown roast of pork with onion, breadcrumb and pork stuffing, before my friends and I devoured it at Thanksgiving 2011. Let's be real: Nobody likes roasted turkey. Screw the pilgrims and skip the turkey this Thanksgiving. Make a delicious crown roast of pork instead. Roasting turkeys at Thanksgiving is a sad and pointless tradition that inflicts needless misery on tens of millions of diners, not to mention turkeys, every Thanksgiving. Yes, people like Thanksgiving dinner, but not because of turkey. They like stuffing and mashed potatoes and creamed spinach and whatever other butter-laden sides their families make. Turkey, especially the white meat of the turkey, is dried out and tough at most American homes, and must be doused in gravy before consumption. "But it's good when you douse it in gravy," turkey defenders routinely protest. This is not a defense. Anything is good if you douse it in gravy. "But I have a great brining technique that makes my turkey moist," you might say. Good for you. There's a whole industry built around getting moisture into turkey meat. Williams-Sonoma has figured out that people will pay $17 for a 9-oz. tin of salt, sugar and spices if you market it as a way to prevent turkey from being dry and horrible. This only emphasizes the sadness of turkey: With great effort and brining and salting and flipping and other kitchen jiu-jitsu, it can be upgraded from bad to unobjectionable. But even after all that effort, it doesn't become awesome, just O.K. This is why you should give up on the turkey and go for a meat that has a high enough fat content to be delicious on its own: a crown roast of pork. The crown roast is 12 bone-in pork rib chops, tied into a circle. (You can get your butcher to do the trimming and the tying.) I'm partial to this recipe from Gourmet magazine in 2005, which involves stuffing the roast with more pork. Which brings me to a key point: You can still stuff a crown roast and make gravy for it, in fact, that's encouraged. But the stuffing and the gravy serve as pleasant accompaniments to the crown roast, instead of crutches without which the meat is unpalatable. And a crown roast makes for a dramatic presentation at the table, much like a whole roasted turkey. But unlike with the turkey, the presentation of the roast is not followed by disappointment when people actually eat it. Thanksgiving shouldn't suck. And with pork, it doesn't have to.
Matt Cardy/Getty ImagesThe unluckiest man in the world is an IT guy for British newspaper The Guardian. Years ago James Howells bought a bunch of bitcoins, and now those bitcoins are lost for eternity because they're buried in a landfill. The Guardian's Alex Hern reports: "You know when you put something in the bin, and in your head, say to yourself 'that's a bad idea'? I really did have that," Howells, who works in IT, told the Guardian. "I don't have an exact date, the only time period I can give â€“ and I've been racking my own brains â€“ is between 20 June and 10 August. Probably mid-July". At the time he obliviously threw them away, the 7,500 bitcoins on the hard-drive were worth around Â£500,000. Since then, the cryptocurrency's value has soared, passing $1,000 on Wednesday afternoon. ... That lost hard drive, though, contains the cryptographic "private key" that is needed to be able to access and spend the bitcoins; without it, the "money" is lost forever. Read more here.
Here's a good chart from Blackrock showing bond yields versus dividend yields across the globe. "Some of the traditional sources of yield such as government bonds and money market funds are delivering negative returns after inflation," Blackrock writes. "So, what are your options? Well, the yields on international stocks are higher than those available from many government bonds today and offer greater protection in the face of rising rates." Basically, Blackrock wants investors to know that investing in (the right, "highest quality") stocks will help them generate income in this global low interest rate environment. Take a look.

The Fine Young GentlemanMinus a few exceptions, men can't buy a good pair of dress shoes for under $350. The idea of the $150 dress shoe (most of which have cemented on soles and corrected grain leather, those noted in this article are of course not that) is a false economy. You will go through multiple pairs of said junk shoes before you would go through one pair of well made welted shoes. Think of it this way: “You are either in your bed or in your shoes. So it pays to invest in both.” Remarked John Wildsmith, who was an English shoemaker.  Luckily, the price of that investment has become more reasonable over the past few years with a plethora of upstart men’s dress shoe brands popping up across the globe. A man doesn’t have to just look to England, Italy and America to find well-made dress shoes. Singapore, Spain, Portugal, China and Mexico are all capable of producing quality shoes at a reasonable price. However, to find many of these brands you often had to head to the Internet. Whether or not you would buy a pair of dress shoes online without trying them on first is a matter of personal preference. But just know that if you are open to it, you often have the opportunity of getting a better value.  For those of you not comfortable with doing so, there are solid options to be had in person. But as is often the case, you get what you pay for, so you should expect to get a substantially better shoe for $350 than $135.  So without further delay, here’s a list of 12 brands you should check out for less than $350.
Reuters Matt Yglesias makes an important point here: Almost everyone talking about how there's a tech bubble these days has no recollection of what the late '90s was like. It was orders of magnitude more crazy. Let me just share some observations, memories, and personal experiences from that time. - The summer of my freshmen year, I put $2,000 into a SureTrade account. By Christmas of that year (1999) I had ballooned that to about $30,000, enabling me to pay for much of my college education. - This feat was accomplished by buying the crappiest of the crap. My friend who I got into investing with would trawl the message boards of folks talking about penny stocks and buy whatever was the biggest up-mover of the day. Invariably the stock would go even more nuts the next day. We had no idea how it worked, but it kept working for long enough to make a stupid amount of money in a short period of time. There was no skill involved. Just being dumb and lucky. - Virtually every restaurant in our town in Vermont in the summer of 1999 had CNBC playing all during the day on some TV. The owner of our local pizzeria was into Internet stocks. He made a ton of money in Mail.com. There's a good chance he rode that all the way down. - One of our best friends' dad, who never had any interest in investing, got into Internet stocks. He found some company building websites. Rode it up for like a 50-bagger, and then rode it all the way down. - In August 1999, people piled into the penny stock of a Nevada auto company that claimed it had a cure for AIDS. An auto company, people. That's how gullible and optimistic everyone was. NYT - People were so optimistic that they believed a one-axel scooter would totally transform cities. - In November 1999, China came to a major agreement with the US to enter the World Trade Organization. Literally every stock that had the word "China" in its name, or had any tenuous connection to China that day went bananas. It was ridiculous. - People seriously got excited about the stock of the company K-Tel (the purveyor of corny oldies compilation CDs) because it was selling its CDs over the Internet. CNET - The infamous Pets.com sock puppet was the last item sold before the company's collapse. - When modem and networking company 3COM spun out Palm (the maker of Palm Pilots) Palm had a higher market cap than 3COM even though 3COM owned most of Palm's stock. - The exact same thing happened when a sleepy Canadian telco spun off Net2Phone, its VoIP unit. Fool.com - Some company you've never heard of called VA Linux popped over 10x at its IPO. They just made commodity Linux servers, but they had Linux in the name, so people went bananas for it. - Pretty much everyone I knew at the time living in San Diego got rich overnight because of one stock. Money - This was an actual book. Amazon - People were quitting their job to just day trade. - There were shootings at day-trading places. So yes, today's bubble is nothing at all like those days, and if someone even thinks about comparing today to 1999 they know nothing about a bubble.
AP ImagesFormer Merrill Lynch CEO Stan O'NealBloomberg Businessweek has a new behind-the-scenes look at a huge Merrill Lynch racial discrimination lawsuit brought by black brokers that ended with a $160 million settlement. "The Man Who Took On Merrill" by Karen Weise reveals the litigation strategy that convinced the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals to issue the landmark ruling finding that the case brought by a broker named George McReynolds could move forward as a class action. This decision was crucial to getting Merrill to settle, since a class-action lawsuit representing 1,200 plaintiffs is much more high-stakes than a case filed on behalf of a single plaintiff. The class action alleged Merrill prevented black brokers from succeeding by giving them less assistance earlier on in their careers than whites and by socially ostracizing them. The Seventh Circuit's decision to let McReynolds' case move forward as a class action actually came after the U.S. Supreme Court made it more difficult to bring employee class actions. So, how did McReynolds' lawyers convince the Seventh Circuit to let their class action move forward? Here was plaintiffs' lawyer Linda Friedman's strategy, from the Bloomberg Businessweek story. Friedman drew on a trick sheâ€™d learned over years of working on civil rights cases. White people, even judges, sometimes seemed to understand gender discrimination better than racial bias, so she likened Merrillâ€™s teaming policy [in which preexisting "teams" of brokers get to pick new members] to when police departments first allowed women into the force. If departments allowed veteran officers to pick their own partners, the force would never have been integrated, she reasoned. This, Friedman argued, is what was happening to black brokers at Merrill. Judge Richard Posner, one of the leading conservative jurists in the country, pounced on the analogy, posing a series of additional questions. â€œIs it like a fraternity? Theyâ€™re not picked?â€ he asked. â€œWhen Judge Posner related it to a fraternity, we felt somebody finally got what we were trying to say,â€ McReynolds says. â€œIt wasnâ€™t clear that he would rule our way, but at least he understood our perspective.â€ Judge Posner really seemed to buy that argument in his decision last year finding the case should be a class action. "The teams, they say, are little fraternities (our term but their meaning), and as in fraternities the brokers choose as team members people who are like themselves," he wrote. "If they are white, they, or some of them anyway, are more comfortable teaming with other white brokers."
While housing markets across the globe slowly recover, it's no great secret that some seem crazy overvalued. Take London, for example, where asking prices jumped 10% in October alone and foreign buyers are swooping in to buy. Hites Ahir and Prakash Loungani at theÂ International Monetary Fund are out with a new report that puts global housing markets in perspective.Â  Global housing prices rose in the second quarter of 2013, the sixth straight quarter of growth.Â  "House prices rose in 32 of the 51 advanced and emerging market economies in the IMFâ€™s Global House Price Index, compared with increases in 9 countries in the second quarter of 2009, when the housing crisis was in full swing," according to the report.  For many OECD countries, however, "the ratio of house prices to rentsâ€”a typical measure of house price valuationâ€”remains above historical averages, leaving room for price corrections down the road." Take a look at Canada in the chart below. The country's ratio is 85% above the average. IMF
Reuters/China DailyA girl runs in front of an advertising board in Taizhou, Zhejiang province. China baby-related products companies, such as Goodbaby International and Mengniu Dairy, were set to jump on Monday after Beijing relaxed its one-child policy. By promising to relax its “one child policy” the Chinese government has sounded the death knell for one of its most unpopular edicts, demographers here and abroad agree. “This marks the beginning of the end of the one-child policy,” says Wang Feng, a population expert at the University of California, Irvine. “But they don’t want to go over a cliff so they’ll do it a step at a time.” Leaders of the ruling Communist party emerged from a policy summit last week to announce that henceforth all Chinese couples in which just one partner is a single child will be allowed to have two children. Until now, only if both partners were single children have urban couples been allowed to breach the “one child” rule. The policy has several other exceptions, such as for rural and ethnic-minority communities.  The new rules, which provincial governments are expected to introduce over the next few months, mark the latest in a series of steps the authorities have taken to loosen the “one child policy” as they try to counter its increasingly damaging side effects. RECOMMENDED: How much do you know about China? Take our quiz. Introduced in 1979, the policy is officially credited with preventing 400 million births and keepingChina’s population down to its current 1.3 billion. But Chinese couples have long resented the government’s heavy-handed interference in their personal choices, and demographers have been warning that Beijing’s population policies are now doing the country more harm than good. For a start, Chinese society is aging rapidly, laying an ever greater pension and health-care burden at the government’s doorstep. The proportion of citizens over 60 will have doubled by 2050 to nearly 35 percent, according to government forecasts. The labor force, meanwhile, shrank last year for the first time, and will continue to shrink for the foreseeable future. Even if the new policy encourages more babies, they will not be in a position to start work for two decades. In the meantime, a smaller workforce means higher wages as employers compete to attract ever-scarcer staff. Wage inflation, combined with higher costs for land and other inputs, has pushed jobs offshore to Vietnam, Cambodia, and other Southeast Asian nations where salaries are lower than in China. At the same time, the one-child policy and Chinese parents’ preference for male children – combined with recourse to illegal sex-selective abortions – have led to a grave gender imbalance. Last year 118 boys were born for every 100 girls in China, a long-standing pattern that will leave an estimated 35 million young Chinese men without marriage partners over the next decade. “The old policy was aimed at curbing population growth,” says Zhai Zhenwu, dean of the School of Sociology and Population Studies at Renmin University in Beijing. “Now the goal is to avoid a second ‘one-child generation.’” Family tastes have changed That may not be as easy as simply allowing people to have more children, warns Feng Xiaotian, a demographer at Nanjing University who has tracked changing attitudes to family size. Talk of a baby boom may be misplaced.  Over the past three decades of the “one-child policy,” he says, “the social desire to have children has decreased. A single child is no longer considered unusual or creepy but quite normal.” RECOMMENDED: Monitor Frontier Markets Free Trial. Intelligent analysis on events in frontier/emerging countries. Prof. Feng’s studies suggest that only 30 to 40 percent of couples now allowed to have another child will actually choose to do so. In Henan Province, for example, the last place to allow couples to have two children if both parents were themselves single children, officials had predicted an extra 18,000 births in the wake of the relaxation. In fact, according to the provincial family planning bureau, only about 600 couples applied for permission to have a second child in the two years since the rule change. “China has changed,” says Prof. Wang, as young parents weigh the costs of raising a second child. “The economic consequences of having children in China is very much the same as elsewhere in East Asia,” he points out, “and there is a strong regional culture of wanting children to be successful,” which is easier to ensure if parents can concentrate their time and money on just one child. As in the rest of East Asia, agrees Prof. Zhai, “Chinese birth rates will fall in the long term because as society develops, couples do not need to raise children to take care of them in their old age – they can rely on welfare. The cost of raising kids is rising and the benefits are falling.” The Chinese government has been extremely cautious about modifying a policy that has been the central pillar of its approach to population for the past three decades, but the authorities now appear to acknowledge that it is increasingly irrelevant. In 10 years, predicts Zhai, Beijing will allow all couples to have two children, and once that final relaxation is in place, “the family planning system will have lost its purpose, and it will gradually fade away.”

Societe Generale's Albert Edwards is one of many strategists who continue to warn that high corporate profit margins are unsustainable. In his latest research note, he warns that the margin squeeze is on, and that's likely to be bad news for the economy. "[A] recession seems a distant prospect in the minds of most investors," writes Edwards. "Yet one key precursor for a recession has now fallen into place. Slowing productivity growth means that unit labour costs are now running well ahead of output price inflation (see chart below). This means a margin and profits downturn is now about to unfold. That typically is a key precursor of recession." Societe Generale Predicting recessions is an unpopular practice on Wall Street. So you rarely hear about them until it's too late. "One thing that is axiomatic in this business: I have never ever seen the sell-side predict a recession," he said. "There are a number of reasons for that, but key among them is the personal career risk of calling a recession and being wrong. Both the sell-side and the buy-side tend to do much better when the economy and the markets are doing well, so who wants to be a party-pooper. That is the nature of the beast." We are 55 months into the current economic cycle, which is a shorter duration than the previous three cycles. But Edwards warns against think that that means this cycle can go on. "Similarly, investorsÂ’ perceptions of the Â‘normalÂ’ length of an economic cycle are strongly influenced by their own working experience," he said. "In that context the last three economic cycles have been unusually lengthy, averaging 95 months from trough to peak (see chart below). But these cycles were perversions of the economic cycle, as the Fed manipulated the private sector credit cycle to extend the cycle which became known as The Great Moderation. The longer the cycle lasts, the more investors convince themselves that it has been abolished and lower their guard in relation to overpaying for cyclical investments (aka risk)." According to NBER data, the average cycle has lasted around 36 months. Societe Generale Edwards also notes that business investment has been slowing, which is an ominous indicator for the economy. The margin squeeze mentioned above only puts more pressure on businesses to reign in investment spending. All of this looks very bad.
REUTERS/Toby MelvilleSir Nicholas Winton poses in front of the Winton train at Liverpool Street station in central London in 2009. The historical train departed from Prague on Tuesday to re-trace the original route from Prague to London with several survivors and descendants of 669 so-called "Winton's children" on board.On Dec. 3, 1938, a British stockbroker made the impromptu decision to cancel his skiing vacation and join a friend in Prague, who had desperately asked for his help. The decision changed his life and saved the lives of 669 people in the process. Nicholas Winton, now 104 years-old, joined his friend Martin Blake in Czechoslovakia to help refugees created by the German annexation of the Sudentenland. Winton was of German Jewish ancestry and had heard of the violence against Jewish communities in Germany and Austria, especially the infamous Kristellnacht. After hearing about the Kinderstransport, an effort of British Jewish agencies to bring 10,000 Jewish children to Great Britain, Winton knew he had to arrange a similar operation in Czechoslovakia. Winton explained how the operation got started in The Power Of Good: Nicholas Winton, a documentary on his efforts: "I found out that the children of refugees and other groups of people who were enemies of Hitler weren't being looked after. I decided to try to get permits to Britain for them. I found out that the conditions which were laid down for bringing in a child were chiefly that you had a family that was willing and able to look after the child, and Â£50, which was quite a large sum of money in those days, that was to be deposited at the Home Office. The situation was heartbreaking. Many of the refugees hadn't the price of a meal. Some of the mothers tried desperately to get money to buy food for themselves and their children. The parents desperately wanted at least to get their children to safety when they couldn't manage to get visas for the whole family. I began to realize what suffering there is when armies start to march." Winton set up his rescue operation at his hotel in Prague, taking applications from parents and registering the children. The response was huge, with thousands of parents lining up. Surprisingly, Winton recieved little resistance from the Nazis on his effort to move the children out of the country.Â  "We were getting rid of those people Hitler wanted to get rid of,"Â Winton told ABC News in 2008. "I mean, you even had the Gestapo at Wilson Station helping the children onto the trains." After a few weeks, Winton left Trevor Chadwick in charge of the Prague operation and returned to London to negotiate where the children would go. Only Great Britain and Sweden agreed to take the children.Â  REUTERS/Toby Melville Original legal documents for entry into Great Britain are held by one of the so-called "Winton's children.â€ To get foster families willing to pay the Â£50 fee for each child, Winton advertised in newspapers, churches, and synagogues with pictures of the children. The effort worked.Â  The last train of children left Prague on August 22, 1939. By the time it was all said and done, he had saved 669 children.  His greatest regret is that he could not save more. There was to be another train of children on September 1st, but Hitlerâ€™s Germany invaded Poland that day. All borders were closed. The children were never heard from again. Winton never told anyone of his mission, not even his wife, Grete. 50 years later, in 1988, his wife found a scrapbook with photos, documents, and the list of children.Â She brought it to a Holocaust historian, who arranged for Wintonâ€™s story to appear on BBCâ€™s Thatâ€™s Life. Unbeknownst to him, the audience at the taping was filled with his â€œchildren.â€ You can see his emotional reaction here: Â  During an interview in 2008, WintonÂ told a Slovakian teenager his philosophy on life: â€œYou need to be prepared always to help other people if there is an opportunity to do so.â€ â€œWintonâ€™s children,â€ as they are called, have gone onto extraordinary lives.

YouTubeSorry, but ...Â  1.Â Saying "I'll be greedy when others are fearful" is much easier than actually doing it. 2.Â The gulf between a great company and a great investment can be extraordinary. 3.Â Markets go through at least one big pullback every year, and one massive one every decade. Get used to it. It's just what they do. 4.Â There is virtually no accountability in the financial pundit arena. People who have been wrong about everything for years still draw crowds. 5.Â As Erik Falkenstein says: "In expert tennis, 80% of the points are won, while in amateur tennis, 80% are lost. The same is true for wrestling, chess, and investing: Beginners should focus on avoiding mistakes, experts on making great moves." 6.Â There are tens of thousands of professional money managers. Statistically, a handful of them have been successful by pure chance. Which ones? I don't know, but I bet a few are famous. 7.Â On that note, some investors who we call "legendary" have barely, if at all, beaten an index fund over their careers. On Wall Street, big wealth isn't indicative of big returns.Â  8.Â During recessions, elections, and Federal Reserve policy meetings, people become unshakably certain about things they know nothing about. 9.Â The more comfortable an investment feels, the more likely you are to be slaughtered. 10.Â Time-saving tip: Instead of trading penny stocks, just light your money on fire. Same for leveraged ETFs. 11.Â Not a single person in the world knows what the market will do in the short run. End of story. 12.Â The analyst who talks about his mistakes is the guy you want to listen to. Avoid the guy who doesn't -- his are much bigger. 13.Â You don't understand a big bank's balance sheet. The people running the place and their accountants don't, either. 14.Â There will be seven to 10 recessions over the next 50 years. Don't act surprised when they come. 15.Â Thirty years ago, there was one hour of market TV per day. Today there's upwards of 18 hours. What changed isn't the volume of news, but the volume of drivel.Â  16.Â Warren Buffett's best returns were achieved when markets were much less competitive. It's doubtful anyone will ever match his 50-year record. 17.Â Most of what is taught about investing in school is theoretical nonsense. There are very few rich professors. 18.Â The more someone is on TV, the less likely his or her predictions are to come true. (U.C. Berkeley psychologist Phil Tetlock has data on this). 19.Â Related: Trust no one who is on CNBC more than twice a week. 20.Â The market doesn't care how much you paid for a stock. Or your house. Or what you think is a "fair" price. 21.Â The majority of market news is not only useless, but also harmful to your financial health. 22.Â Professional investors have better information and faster computers than you do. You will never beat them short-term trading. Don't even try.Â  23.Â How much experience a money manager has doesn't tell you much. You can underperform the market for an entire career. And many have. 24.Â The decline of trading costs is one of the worst things to happen to investors, as it made frequent trading possible. High transaction costs used to cause people to think hard before they acted. 25.Â Professional investing is one of the hardest careers to succeed at, but it has low barriers to entry and requires no credentials. That creates legions of "experts" who have no idea what they are doing. People forget this because it doesn't apply to many other fields. 26.Â Most IPOs will burn you. People with more information than you have want to sell. Think about that. 27.Â When someone mentions charts, moving averages, head-and-shoulders patterns, or resistance levels, walk away. 28.Â The phrase "double-dip recession" was mentioned 10.8 million times in 2010 and 2011, according to Google. It never came. There were virtually no mentions of "financial collapse" in 2006 and 2007. It did come. 29.Â The real interest rate on 20-year TreasuriesÂ is negative, and investors are plowing money into them. Fear can be a much stronger force than arithmetic. 30.Â The bookÂ Where Are the Customers' Yachts? was written in 1940, and most still haven't figured out that financialÂ advisorsÂ don't have their best interest at heart. 31.Â The low-cost index fund is one of the most useful financial inventions in history. Boring but beautiful.Â  32.Â The best investors in the world have more of an edge in psychology than in finance. 33.Â What markets do day to day is overwhelmingly driven by random chance. Ascribing explanations to short-term moves is like trying to explain lottery numbers. 34.Â For most, finding ways to save more money is more important than finding great investments. 35.Â If you have credit card debt and are thinking about investing in anything, stop. You will never beat 30% annual interest.Â  36.Â A large portion of share buybacks are just offsetting shares issued to management as compensation. Managers still tout the buybacks as "returning money to shareholders." 37.Â The odds that at least one well-known company is insolvent and hiding behind fraudulent accounting are high. 38.Â Twenty years from now theÂ S&amp;P 500Â (INDEX:Â ^GSPCÂ Â ) will look nothing like it does today. Companies die and new ones emerge. 39.Â Twelve years agoÂ General MotorsÂ (NYSE:Â GMÂ Â ) was on top of the world andÂ Apple(Nasdaq:Â AAPLÂ Â ) was laughed at. A similar shift will occur over the next decade, but no one knows to what companies. 40.Â Most would be better off if they stopped obsessing about Congress, the Federal Reserve, and the president and focused on their own financial mismanagement.Â  41.Â For many, a house is a large liability masquerading as a safe asset. 42.Â The president has much less influence over the economy than people think. 43.Â However much money you think you'll need for retirement, double it. Now you're closer to reality. 44.Â The next recession is never like the last one.Â  45.Â Remember what Buffett says about progress: "First come the innovators, then come the imitators, then come the idiots." 46.Â And what Mark Twain says about truth: "A lie can travel halfway around the world while truth is putting on its shoes." 47.Â And what Marty Whitman says about information: "Rarely do more than three or four variables really count. Everything else is noise." 48.Â The bigger a merger is, the higher the odds it will be a flop. CEOsÂ loveÂ empire-building by overpaying for companies. 49.Â Investments that offer little upside and big downside outnumber those with the opposite characteristics at least 10-to-1. 50.Â The most boring companies -- toothpaste, food, bolts -- can make some of the best long-term investments. The most innovative, some of the worst.
WikipediaThe University of Michigan Consumer Confidence measure is out, and it crushed expectations. Consumer confidence jumped to 75.1 in November, besting expectations for 73.1 The figure was up from the preliminary readingÂ of 72.0. The new report suggests that the dip in consumer confidence brought on by the government shutdown and debt ceiling saga has bounced back. The economic conditions sub-index dropped to 88.0 from October's 89.9 print. The economic outlook sub-index rose to 66.8 from October's 62.5 figure. The "1-year ahead" inflation expectation edged down to 2.9% from 3.0% in October. "November Michigan consumer sentiment will likely be revised up slightly in the second pass, putting the month roughly in line with October," Citi's Peter D'Antonio wrote clients ahead of the report. "However, as the rise in optimism seems to have come late in the month, some of the improvement may actually boost the early December reading instead."

en.wikipedia.orgInterpipe, the Ukrainian pipemaker owned by Victor Pinchuk, son-in-law of ex-President Leonid Kuchma, has released its first official acknowledgment that it is in default on $106 million of debt owed to its banks. In astatementÂ yesterday on the company website, Interpipe said negotiations are under way with the banks, and that they had been informed in advance of the companyâ€™s failure to meet the repayment amount due on November 1. â€œThe creditor banksâ€, according to Interpipe, â€œhave formed a steering committee of creditors. The parties will have to agree to change the schedule of payments on the main body of the loans, as well as some other changes in the loan agreement conditions. The company plans to continue to pay interest on all borrowings in full. The operating activities of Interpipe run in the normal mode.â€ Interpipeâ€™s debts currently exceed $1.3 billion; it has less thanÂ $50 million in cash. The banks, which negotiated with Interpipe for an earlier debt restructuring agreement in 2011, include Citi, Barclays, Intesa, ING, and Credit Agricole. The banks are not commenting publicly except for Intesa in Milan; it said this week it is aware of the default and is evaluating the situation with the other lenders.SACE, the Italian export finance agency which is owed $225 million of Interpipeâ€™s debt, is participating in the steering group. It is not clear whether holders of $200 million in Interpipeâ€™s bond debt are represented in the bank negotiations. The trustee for the bondholders, most of whom are connected to Pinchuk, is Deutsche Bank. In Luxembourg Interpipe is under investigation by regulators for failing to list its bonds on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange as it announced it would do by an October deadline. A Luxembourg source close to the investigation has warned that because Cyprus law governs the Interpipe holding company, a court filing may be triggered in Nicosia under the bankruptcy provisions of theÂ Cyprus Companies Act. According to Article 212 of that statute, â€œa company shall be deemed to be unable to pay its debts: (a) if a creditor, by assignment or otherwise, to whom the company is indebted in a sum exceeding eight hundred, fifty-four euros [ â‚¬854] then due has served on the company, by leaving it at the registered office of the company, a demand under his hand requiring the company to pay the sum so due and the company has for three weeks thereafter neglected to pay the sum or to secure or compound for it to the reasonable satisfaction of the creditor; or (b) if execution or other process issued on a judgment, decree or order of any Court in favour of a creditor of the company is returned unsatisfied in whole or in part; or (c) if it is proved to the satisfaction of the Court that the company is unable to pay its debts, and, in determining whether a company is unable to pay its debts, the Court shall take into account the contingent and prospective liabilities of the company.â€ A source familiar with Pinchukâ€™s position in Cyprus believes he is now vulnerable there to an attack from Ukrainian rivals. â€œThe ingredients required are nothing more than a creditor entitled to more than â‚¬854; a demand notice lodged in Nicosia court; and Interpipeâ€™s failure to satisfy the debt claim after three weeks. The banks and the Italian Finance Ministry behind SACE donâ€™t want to see a raid on their security pledges, but if thereâ€™s the will now in Kiev, they will be as powerless to stop it as Pinchuk.â€ The possibility that a Ukrainian raider is preparing to call Interpipe on its indebtedness, and force a bankruptcy sale of assets, was revealed in Kiev early this month when an unknown entity called International Investments Technology (IIT) announced it has bought up trade payables owed by Interpipe to its suppliers. That debt is at leastÂ $230 million. IIT confirms its published announcement of the transaction. But it declines to elaborate on the value of the transaction and refuses to confirm who controls IIT. Interpipe management is neither confirming nor denying the deal. According to Interpipeâ€™s latest announcement, â€œthe major reason for a shift in the loan paymentsâ€™ schedule relates to the current market situation, and specifically the drop in sales and profitability in Russia and the Customs Union (CU) countries, due to the delivery conditions change by CU for INTERPIPE pipe products. Additionally, the recession in the Ukrainian railcar construction industry, which, in its turn, has led to a drop in the purchase of INTERPIPE wheel products, has also affected the repayment schedule.â€ According to Alexander Kirichko, Interpipeâ€™s chief executive, â€œthe companyâ€™s position as a global player will help to compensate in the regional reduction in sales. In 2014, the company will continue its diversification strategy, and it will focus on growing Interpipeâ€™s profile in South America, the Middle East, and Europeâ€. Specialized billet sales are one of the product diversifications being market- tested at the moment. Last weekâ€™s decision by the Ukrainian President Victor Yanukovich (right image, right) to align the countryâ€™s foreign and economic policy with Russia, rejecting the partnership agreement with the European Union planned for this week, has triggered speculation in Moscow that penalty duties introduced in July 1 to stop imports of Ukrainian pipes may be lifted. Mikhail Rodionov, an analyst with Rusmet, comments: â€œAnything is possible. Duties in any case will be reduced due to Russiaâ€™s entry into the WTO. Will there be any other measures â€“ this is a question not only of economy, but also of politics.â€ In the Ukraine Pinchuk has been the only domestic steelmaker to take a public position against the Russian alliance. Through a lobby group he calls the Yalta European Strategy (YES), Pinchuk has financed an international campaign for Ukraineâ€™s signature on the EU partnership agreement. Pinchuk has also paid for anti-Russian lobbying in Washington and London, aiming at Bill and Hillary Clinton and Tony Blair. In Paris and on the Cote dâ€™Azur, where Pinchuk sails his motor yachtÂ Onenessduring the summer season, Pinchukâ€™s lobbying has aimed at current cabinet minister Aurelie Filippetti, Dominique Villepin, a former prime minister, and others influential in French politics. Oleg Kalinskiy, director of the Fund for Pipe Industry Development, an industry lobby group in Moscow, reveals that the secretariat of the customs union of Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus is already considering whether to allow duty-free imports of Ukrainian pipes. â€œCurrently the Eurasian Economic Commission is revising rates of anti-dumping duties on a number of Ukrainian enterprises for some types of steel pipes of Ukrainian origin. Before the announcement of the official results of the investigation we consider itâ€™s premature to comment.â€ Pipe imports were discussed yesterday in Moscow at a meeting of steelmakers with Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev. Dmitry Pumpyansky, the control shareholder of TMK, Russiaâ€™s largest pipemaker, attended. In the absence of a statement from the prime ministry, press reports from attendees at the meeting say there is strong resistance from the Russian pipemakers and the steelmills which supply the sheet for pipe manufacture to any move that would lift the protective import tariffs for the time being. Pipe imports were discussed with the Prime Minister, and stronger measures were mentioned, including a possible anti-dumping inquiry targeted at imports of Chinese pipes. In its quarterlyÂ financial reportÂ issued today, TMK said that in the three months to September 30, its Russian division suffered a 14% quarter-on-quarter decline of revenues to $998 million, and a 36% drop in earnings to $134 million. TMK said it is hoping for a recovery this quarter in Russian sales of seamless oil and gas pipes and line pipe. But that depends, as Pumpyansky told the prime minister Monday, on restricting imports of the types of pipes Interpipe and other Ukrainian mills export. A source close to the Russian trade ministry in Moscow said: â€œMr Pinchukâ€™s business model is failing and instead of paying his debts he wants to portray himself as a victim of Russia. Itâ€™s a nice excuse if he doesnâ€™t want to pay his debts, but who believes it? Khartsyzsk [Pipe Plant of Donetsk, owned by Rinat Akhmetov] may get access to our market because of its relationship with Gazprom. But for Interpipeâ€™s products, we wish Mr Pinchuk good fortune with his friends in the European Union. Maybe Tony Blair needs pipes.â€

REUTERS/China DailyDurable goods orders fell by 2.0% in October due to lower aircraft orders. This was right in line with expectations. Still, orders excluding transportation fell 0.1%, missing expectations for a 0.5% gain. Nondefense capital goods orders excluding aircraft â€” a key measure of business investment â€” fell 1.2%, which was much worse than the 0.8% increase expected. "The continuing slump in US non-defencs capital goods (ex. aircraft) orders and shipments suggests that business equipment investment contracted over the entire second half of this year," said Capital Economics Paul Ashworth. "The survey evidence on capex intentions has been pointing to a rebound in equipment investment for some time now, but it just isn't coming through in the actual hard data." "The overall tone of this report was quite disappointing, signaling continued weakness in business capital investment which we expect to create a drag on economic activity this quarter," said TD Securities' Millan Mulraine. "The weak tone is likely due to the heightened political and fiscal uncertainties in October (at the time of the government shutdown). However, with the prospects of another government shutdown looming early next year we are unlikely to see a meaningful pick-up in investment activity in the coming months." Markets aren't moving much in response to the report. Dow futures are up 15 points. S&amp;P futures are up 1.3 points.
TBI Initial jobless claims fell to 316,000 in the Department of Labor's latest tally. Economists had expected seasonally-adjusted initial unemployment insurance claims to increase to 330,000 from 323,000 a week ago (that 323,000 figure was revised up to 326,000). As far as the unadjusted figures, "The advance number of actual initial claims under state programs, unadjusted, totaled 363,053 in the week ending November 23, an increase of 37,229 from the previous week." "The advance unadjusted insured unemployment rate was 2.1 percent during the week ending November 16, an increase of 0.2 percentage point from the prior week," according to the report. "The advance unadjusted number for persons claiming UI benefits in state programs totaled 2,684,088, an increase of 143,750 from the preceding week. A year earlier, the rate was 2.2 percent and the volume was 2,835,628." "We suspect the 21k decline in jobless claims in the latest week was exaggerated by seasonal factors," said UBS's Sam CoffinÂ ahead of the report. "The last year with a similar calendar to this year was 2008, and at this time in 2008, jobless claims were rising about 20k per week. We expect some downward bias to persist into the upcoming (Thanksgiving) week."
YouTube / The Center for Retirement InvestingBurton MalkielFor nearly 70 years, many investors and investment advisors used a basic formula to guide them in creating diversified portfolios: the 60/40 (60 percent/40 percent) stock/bond split. The strategy worked well: It returned 10 percent a year from 1990â€“2011. The question nowâ€”as the number of asset classes and strategies available cheaply to investors proliferates, and the risk of holding U.S. bonds risesâ€”is whether the classic 60/40 portfolio split has outlived its investment usefulness and, if so, what should replace it? For all practical purposes, the short answer is yes, according to Burt Malkiel, Wealthfront chief investment officer, Princeton professor and author of the investment classic, "A Random Walk Down Wall Street," a book that helped launch the low-cost index-investing revolution. Malkiel recently told CNBC that the 60/40 rule was an oversimplification from the beginning. Now he thinks it is downright dangerous. "The investor in bonds is, I think, very likely to get badly hurt by sticking with the 60/40." Malkiel has a new recommendation for investors, but it is not as appealingly simple as the 60/40 split. Too bad, he said. "I never have liked any kind of norm." (Read more: How to rescue your retirement at 55) Weaning people off the 60/40 concept is a challenge, however, precisely because it has worked in the past. Andrew Ang, the Ann F. Kaplan Professor of Business at Columbia Business School, called the 60/40 rule a shorthand for the concept of diversification. It has been embedded in the investing mind-set since 1952, when Harry Markowitz introduced Modern Portfolio Theory. But in the '50s, there were only two asset classes available cheaplyâ€”stocks and bonds, Ang said. A random walk down dead ends in diversificationWhy 60/40 came to be the norm rather than some other ratio is anybody's guess. Humans seem intuitively drawn to two-thirds, which is also used to represent balance in art and politics. "You'll get similar results doing 50/50 or even 70/30," said Ang, who, like Malkiel, believes that the plain vanilla portfolio is dead in an increasingly complex world. Any norm at all ignores another fundamental investing preceptâ€”that your allocation needs to change to suit your personality and stage of lifeâ€”a more important concept now than 70 years ago, because people live longer and plan their own retirements. (Read more: The moving target otherwise known as target date funds) Investors who let go of oversimplification and embrace a slightly more complex but still low-cost portfolio will be better prepared to meet changes in their lives and the economy, Malkiel said. (The following is an edited version of an interview CNBC recently conducted with the investing guru on the topic of portfolio diversification.) CNBC: Why did we ever get the 60/40 in the first place? Malkiel: I don't know. And I don't like any kind of norm, because it depends on so many factorsâ€”and your personality. The correct allocation ought to depend on individual circumstances. It is definitely not the right kind of thing for everybody. What I had in my "Random Walk" for the last several editions is a quite different allocation. You should have more equity orientation. Another rule of thumb: Jack Bogle has often said bonds should be a percentage equal to your age. I don't agree with that, either. I think that allocation is particularly wrong today because we are in an age of financial repression. ... Europe and Japan are having trouble reining in budget deficits, and we have high debt in the U.S., too. (The governments) are deliberately keeping interest rates down. Even a U.S. bond index fund is not the right thing to do, because BND [Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF] is about two-thirds government or agency bonds. The investor in bonds is, I think, very likely to get badly hurt by sticking with the 60/40. (Read more: 6 tips from Jack Bogle on teaching your kids to invest) CNBC: In the recent editions of "Random Walk," you suggested the following portfolio for an investor in his or her 50sâ€”with each asset class represented by a low-cost fundâ€”and for the percentage allocated to equities to be larger, depending on the age and risk tolerance of the investor: How would you update that portfolio? Malkiel: The recent editions were written when bonds had a generous yield. Today BND yields are about 2.4 percent. That is why we suggest the bond (safer) part of the portfolio be fine-tuned. We ... use high-quality dividend growth stocks for a part of what otherwise would be a straight bond portfolio. Also, we use some foreign bonds where debt/GDP is low and yields are relatively high. The updated portfolio for an investor in his or her 50s would look like: You use that as a starting point and move allocations up or down, depending on your age. (Read more: These stocks will double in five years: Mario Gabelli) CNBC: Is the definition of diversification changing? Malkiel: There are so many more asset classes now. It's not that we want to say absolutely never any bonds. CNBC: How has your view of asset allocation changed over the years? Malkiel: I'm more open to the idea that you need stability. You may not, as an individual, just be psychologically able to stand the amount of volatility that equities have. You want a little more stability. ... I can understand that. It depends on your ability to not go crazy and sell at the wrong time when the equities drop, as they do. I'd like to broaden the definition of how you get the stability. It's just saying ... in today's world, bonds as the only possibility to add stability to a portfolio is a much too narrow way to look at it, and a suboptimal way. We're talking about a broader definition of diversification. There are some financial advisors using this window to broaden it to include a lot of alternative asset classes, like gold. Some are even suggesting hedge funds. I believe in wider diversification, but for me wider diversification would be to look at some emerging markets that are very unpopular. Or REITs. Real estate is a hard asset, good when inflation is low. Something like a hedge fund that charges 2.20 percent is a sure loser.  I'm not a big fan of gold. People say it's a hedge against Armageddon. If the world disappears, your asset allocation will be the least of your concerns. CNBC: What are the criteria you use to judge an asset class? Malkiel: You want to control the things you can control. Worry very much about the costs you pay. All of us who deal with the stock market need to be very modest about our ability to make money. But the one thing is certain: The lower the fee I pay ... the more there will be for other investments. Worry about taxes on an asset class, fees, and you do want to be diversified. It's a totally reasonable thing to want stability, but it is not clear to me that that means bondsâ€”or U.S. bonds, specifically. â€”By Elizabeth MacBride, Special to CNBC.com
REUTERS/Damir SagoljAnti-government protesters push the fence before breaking into the compound of the Department of Special Investigation in Bangkok November 27, 2013. Thousands of Thai demonstrators massed outside four ministries, a major government office complex and 19 provincial halls on Wednesday in an effort to cripple the administration and oust Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra. Good morning! Here's what you need to know.
Four years later, he was looking for ways to grow his small magazine and started selling mail-order records to the students who bought the magazine. The records sold well enough that he built his first record store the next year. After two years of selling records, he decided to open his own record label and recording studio. He rented the recording studio out to local artists, including one named Mike Oldfield. In that small recording studio, Oldfield created his hit song “Tubular Bells,” which became the record label’s first release. The song went on to sell more than five million copies. Over the next decade, the young boy grew his record label by adding bands such as the Sex Pistols, Culture Club and the Rolling Stones. Along the way, he continued starting companies: an airline business, then trains, mobile phones, and on and on. Almost 50 years later, more than 400 companies were under his direction. Today, that young boy who dropped out of school and kept starting things despite his inexperience and lack of knowledge is a billionaire. His name is Sir Richard Branson. I walked into the conference room in Moscow, and Branson was sitting in a chair 10 feet away from me. There were 100 other people around us, but it felt like we were having a conversation in my living room. He was smiling and laughing. His answers seemed unrehearsed and genuine. At one point, he told the story of how he started Virgin Airlines, a tale that seems to capture his entire approach to business and life. Here’s the version he told us, as best I can remember it: I was in my late 20s, so I had a business, but nobody knew who I was at the time. I was headed to the Virgin Islands and I had a very pretty girl waiting for me, so I was, um, determined to get there on time. At the airport, my final flight to the Virgin Islands was cancelled because of maintenance or something. It was the last flight out that night. I thought, “this is ridiculous,” so I went and chartered a private airplane to take me to the Virgin Islands, which I did not have the money to do. Then, I picked up a small blackboard, wrote “Virgin Airlines: $29” on it, and went over to the group of people who had been on the flight that was cancelled. I sold tickets for the rest of the seats on the plane, used their money to pay for the chartered plane, and we all went to the Virgin Islands that night. After speaking with our group, Branson sat on a panel with industry experts to discuss the future of business. As everyone around him was filling the air with business buzzwords and talking about complex ideas for mapping out our future, Branson was saying things like, “Screw it, just get on and do it.” Which was closely followed by, “Why can’t we mine asteroids?” As I looked up at that panel, I realized the person who sounded the most simplistic was also the only one who was a billionaire. Which prompted me to wonder, “What’s the difference between Branson and everyone else in the room?” Here’s what I think makes all the difference: Branson doesn’t merely say things like, “Screw it, just get on and do it.” He actually lives his life that way. He drops out of school and starts a business. He signs the Sex Pistols to his record label when everyone else says they’re too controversial. He charters a plane when he doesn’t have the money. When everyone else balks or comes up with a good reason for why the time isn’t right, Branson gets started. He figures out how to stop procrastinating and take the first step — even if it seems outlandish. Branson is an extreme example, but we could all learn something from his approach. If you want to summarize the habits of successful people into one phrase, it’s this: successful people start before they feel ready. (Click here to Tweet this idea.) If there was ever someone who embodied the idea of starting before they felt ready to do so, it’s Branson. The very name of his business empire, Virgin, was chosen because when Branson and his partners started, they were “virgins” when it came to business. Branson has started so many businesses, ventures, charities and expeditions that it’s simply not possible for him to have felt prepared, qualified and ready to start all of them. In fact, it’s unlikely he was qualified or prepared to start any of them. He had never flown a plane and didn’t know anything about the engineering of planes, but he started an airline company anyway. He’s a perfect example of why the “chosen ones” choose themselves. If you’re working on something important, then you’ll never feel ready. A side effect of doing challenging work is that you’re pulled by excitement and pushed by confusion at the same time. You’re bound to feel uncertain, unprepared and unqualified. But let me assure you of this: what you have right now is enough. You can plan, delay and revise all you want, but trust me, what you have now is enough to start. It doesn’t matter if you’re trying to start a business, lose weight, write a book or achieve any number of goals. Who you are, what you have and what you know right now is good enough to get going. We all start in the same place: no money, no resources, no contacts, no experience. The difference is that some people — the winners — choose to start anyway. No matter where you are in the world and regardless of what you’re working on, I hope you’ll start before you feel ready.

AnonymousA picture posted on Burger King's Twitter when it was hacked by AnonymousSocial media can be a great way for brands to engage with customers. But when a campaign backfires, the meltdowns are painful and all too public. Here are the best of the worst social media campaigns. Here's our pick of the social media setbacks... Wall Street bank JP Morgan was at the centre of a social media storm earlier this month when it invited Twitter users to send questions to an executive using the hashtag #AskJPM. The Twitterverse responded with a storm of abuse. More than 8,000 responses were sent within a six-hour period, according to social media tracking service Topsy. Two out of every three comments sent were negative. The original idea behind the tweet-up was to give students the opportunity to communicate directly with Jimmy Lee, one of JP Morgan's most senior bankers and a key executive on the Twitter share sale. The live Q&amp;A was due to take place on November 14th, but by the previous afternoon, the company tweeted:â€œTomorrowâ€™s Q&amp;A is cancelled. Bad Idea. Back to the drawing board.â€ The bank has been in the spotlight this year over its $13bn settlement for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities and the $6bn London Whale trading losses. Abusive tweets included: â€œQuick! Youâ€™re in a room with no key, a chair, two paper clips, and a lightbulb. How do you defraud investors?â€, and â€œWhatâ€™s your favourite type of whale? #AskJPMâ€. Twitter: Layoff List - #askjpm Is it easier to purchase a congressional representative or a senator? Twitter: Chris Lee - Why is it when the poor commit crimes we need more cops and mandatory sentences and when the rich commit crimes we need deregulation #askJPM Twitter: Lindsey Sine - But really, we better stop making fun of #askJPM before they find a way to monetize the hillarity and charge us for our enjoyment at 33% APR JP Morgan is not alone in attracting the ire of social media users through an ill-advised online Q&amp;A. In October, British Gas decided to hold a "tweet-up" on the same day as it announced price rises of 10pc, prompting a huge social media backlash. Its #AskBG campaign, manned by Bert Pijls, the companyâ€™s customer service director, was hijacked by users asking questions like, â€œMy office has a window where the sun comes in and makes the side of my head really hot. How much do I owe you?â€ The rise of social media has created a new way for consumers to taunt corporate brands: complaintvertising. This is the method of buying prominent advertising space on Twitter or Facebook to air a grievance. British Airways found out about this new trend the hard way earlier this year, when Hasan Syed used Twitter's self-service ad platform to post a promoted tweet, which read: "Don't fly @British_Airways. Their customer service is horrendous." Mr Syed, a hair-care entrepreneur based in Chicago, had flown business class on the airline with his father on a trip to Paris. When BA lost his father's luggage and failed to respond to his complaint on Twitter, he took matters into his own hands. Mr Syed spent over $1,000 on his smear campaign and his angry tweets were seen by more than 50,000 Twitter users in the UK and New York markets where his promoted tweet ran. The UK's leading supermarket failed to update its auto-tweets when it was embroiled in the horse meat scandal earlier this year. The pre-scheduled tweet read: "It's sleepy time so we're off to hit the hay. See you at 8am for more #TescoTweets." Thousands of users complained about the tweet and @UKTesco later responded: "Iâ€™m terribly sorry. That tweet was scheduled before we knew of the current situation. Weâ€™d never intend to make light of it." The following day, Tesco placed full-page adverts in several national newspapers to apologise for the "unacceptable" situation, vowing to ensure it "never happens again". McDonald's sponsored the hashtag #McDStories in January 2012, asking users to tweet in about positive dining experiences at its restaurants. Instead, respondents joked about obesity and dog food. The burger company pulled the campaign within two hours but users were still tweeting the abandoned hashtag a week after it was removed. In February, the popular burger franchise fell foul to some hacktivists who changed Burger King's account name to McDonald's and added a new bio that stated, "Just got sold to McDonalds because the whopper flopped =[ FREEDOM IS FAILURE." "Look for McDonald's in a hood near you!" This was followed by a string of fake tweets containing racial slurs, obscenities and references to drugs. McDonald's drew further attention to the plight of its rival by tweeting: "We empathize with our @BurgerKing counterparts. Rest assured, we had nothing to do with the hacking." British Airways isn't the only airline to nosedive in the social media stakes. In 2011, Qantas Airways asked customers to write in about their dream in-flight experiences using the hashtag #QuantasLuxury. Instead of being sent wistful flights of fancy, the airline received a deluge of negative posts, mostly concerning the carrier's industrial disputes with three unions, which resulted in the grounding of the entire Qantas fleet on October 29. Quantas is a serial offender on the social media slip-up list. It once ran a Rugby Union competition that asked Wallabies fans to paint their faces black to win a prize. In January this year, a social media exec for music chain HMV tweeted the mass firing of 190 staff live from HMV's proprietary account. The first tweet announced: ""We're tweeting live from HR where we're all being fired! Exciting!!!", follwed by: "There are over 60 of us being fired at once! Mass execution, of loyal employees who love the brand". Unfortunately for HMV, even its inability to lock the outgoing staff out of the social network was broadcast to the masses. The rogue @hmvtweets tweeter wrote: "Just overheard our Marketing Director (he's staying, folks!) ask 'How do I shut down Twitter?'" Amy's Baking Company in Scottsdale, Arizona, was featured in an episode of Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares, which aired on May 10th, 2013. It was the first time Mr Ramsay had walked off the show. The episode prompted a surge of negative feedback on the restaurant's Facebook page. The two owners Samy and Amy Bouzaglo reacted by posting a rant against the â€œhatersâ€ who were crippling their business. The social media storm spilled out onto Reddit and Yelp, with the Bouzaglos responding to disgruntled users using foul language and all-caps. There were nearly 1,000 comments posted to Reddit before the thread was removed and commenting was disabled. When Home Depot tweeted the image below to its 165,000 or so users in November, the US-based DIY store received hundreds of tweets accusing the chain of racism. Home Depot tried to calm the wrathful Twittersphere with a series of apology tweets: "We have zero tolerance for anything so stupid and offensive. Deeply sorry. We terminated agency and individual who posted it" but the image was retweeted thousands of times nonetheless.
Fung Global InstituteHere's a very powerful paragraph from Nomura economist Richard Koo: I have pointed out previously that mini-bubbles can occur during a balance sheet recession. During a usual monetary policy-driven market, money created by an accommodative central bank typically spreads throughout the economy and lifts markets. During a balance sheet recession, however, the private sector is a net saver, which means only the financial sector is flooded with funds that are generated by private sector saving and deleveraging. Let's unpack this a little bit. Richard Koo is the primary believer in what people call a "balance sheet recession", a recession caused by mass deleveraging either by households or by businesses. Koo formed these ideas based on the bust in Japan, as he watched policymakers try in vain to stimulate the economy while businesses continued to cut down on debt. His solution is that fiscal policy â€” direct government spending â€” is what's needed to lift the economy. Cheaper money, he believes, doesn't work when nobody wants to take on debt. In the US he still sees evidence of the private sector being more inclined to save than take on debt, so again he largely views monetary policy as impotent to stimulate the economy. But he does believe than in the absence of the inclination to spend or invest in real things, the Fed's cheap money can and will create financial bubbles. He doesn't necessarily see a big bubble now, but is concerned about "mini bubbles." Koo's comments (which were published in a note yesterday) come following a recent speech from Larry Summers, about how the economy has been impaired for awhile, and that only bubbles have been getting us to full employment in recent cycles. That's a bit different than Koo's idea, though the bigger concern that we're getting bubbles instead of real growth is an increasingly hot topic for economists.
AP Photo/Ben Berry Japanese investment bank Nomura is out with a big global economic outlook for 2014. The title is "The End Of The End Of The World." The theme is that as 2013 comes to a close, the age of crisis is well and truly over. There are still lingering issues of course, but the really huge themes that have dominated the past several years are gone, and concerns over systemic risk will no longer be high on investors minds. Strategist Michael Kurtz and Co. write: There wasn’t any memo, but FYI the Global Financial Crisis is over. Not that clocks have simply rewound to 2006, but: the US property market has been recovering for no less than 20 months, the US household balance sheet is largely repaired, the renminbi is stronger and the US-China current account imbalance vastly reduced, China is grasping the nettle of structural reform, European core-vs-periphery cost differentials have substantially narrowed, and Europe is growing again.  Looking forward, we thus see 2014 as a year in which macrosystemic risks will not dominate equity performance – unfinished QE ‘taper’ business notwithstanding – but equally as a result, a year in which returns will not be spirited along by ‘risk compression’ and multiple expansion either. Rather, global stocks in 2014 will stand or fall in large part simply on whether they deliver earnings. The good news is, 2014 should serve up a reasonably robust growth platform for global corporate earnings: Our economists expect global nominal GDP growth to rise to 7.0% next year from 2013’s 6.1% -- leaving our strategy preferences inclined toward cyclical- and reflation-sensitive sectors. But the acceleration will be unevenly skewed toward the Developed Market economies, while Emerging Market growth plateaus and China’s growth further moderates (to 6.9% in real terms). For investors, this is a double-edged sword. NomuraThe big call.No longer will markets be able to make gains just by wringing out lingering fears of collapse. Markets are going to need actual growth. They write: Looking toward 2014, we believe much of the ‘deep value’ argument for stocks has now played out as the Global Equity Risk Premium has fallen to just 0.4 standard deviations currently vs. its late-2011 high of 2.2 standard deviations. With this, global equities have outperformed the aggregate global bond index since mid-2012 by a sizeable 45% over the same time period. From here, equities will increasingly require more of a growth rationale for upside, rather than the macro-risk compression of 2012-13. The fact is, after fairly undramatic passages (by 2010-12 standards) of such episodes this year as the Cyprus banking failure and October’s US fiscal standoff, very few developments from here are likely to rise to the level of true systemic contagion threats. But this also begs the question where the superlative earnings growth will be found. So where will that growth be found? Nomura's strategists are particularly bullish on Japan and Europe. Conversely, they're concerned that the US will see margin compression (due to mean reversion) and like many others they're not particularly optimistic about emerging markets. As for sectors, they like tech, industrials, consumer discretionary stocks, and financials. Again though, the big picture is that the days when stocks would rise just thanks to systemic fears dissipating is over. Now the hunt is on for real growth.
Getty ImagesLONDON (Reuters) - The message is sinking in - economies of the rich world face super-easy money far into the future and central banks are now convinced it's the least of all policy evils. Despite rumblings of dissent about the financial bubbles and iniquities associated with zero interest rates and money printing, 2013 is ending with a remarkable certainty among global investors that cheap money is around for the long haul. And the outsize financial market reaction this year to even a suggestion the U.S. Federal Reserve would dial back money printing crystallizes the point for many. And even if the Fed does taper asset buying in 2014, liquidity from the Bank of Japan or European Central Bank could be boosted to offset it. That's not to say money managers are all cheer leading this. Many who spoke at Reuters Investment Outlook summit last week doubted its long-term efficacy and feared its social and political fallout even as waves of cheap cash continue to push stock markets to new records. If financial asset owners benefit more from 'quantitative easing' than the jobless or low wage earners, they insist, then monetary pumping merely exaggerates already disturbing wealth and earnings inequality in the United States, Britain and beyond - injects unforseen and incalculable political tension. Yet despite these misgivings, most assume zero interest rates, QE and extraordinary credit easing are the only likely horizon if soundings from the halls of monetary power in Washington, Tokyo, Frankfurt were taken seriously. "We are all long on central banks as an industry," said Pascal Blanque, chief investment officer at Amundi, which has more than $1 trillion in assets under management. "Fears about the normalization by central banks are way overdone." "We are seeing a change of DNA of central banks. What we think non-conventional will become part of theory. And, as often in economic matters, theory comes after practice." The zeitgeist amongst fund chiefs at last week's summit was framed, somewhat ironically, by a speech delivered earlier this month by someone considered a relative skeptic on QE compared to the incoming Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen. Former U.S. Treasury chief Larry Summers, once considered a candidate for the top Fed post, spoke about the prospect of 'secular stagnation' in the U.S. economy for years to come - one where the 'natural rate' of interest commensurate with full employment could be minus two or three percent. With economists actively speculating about both the Fed and European Central Bank introducing negative nominal interest rates - or charges in effect - on deposits left by their commercial banks, then the musings are far from outlandish. Summers' point was this growth and interest rate environment could persist for a long time and resultant asset bubbles may be an inevitable and even acceptable by-product. "Somehow, even a 'great bubble' wasn't enough to create any excess in aggregate demand," he said, referring to the absence of inflation, wage, labor or capacity pressures even as one of the biggest credit booms in history crested in 2007. And so if a 'secular stagnation' of sub-par growth and rock-bottom interest rates - the 'new normal' as PIMCO posited back in 2009 - is long road ahead, then liquidity-fueled preferences for corporate debt and equity as well as real estate will likely persist. That's the consensus bet at least. For some, such as Carmignac Gestion's Didier Saint-Georges, this may leave us all in a "QE trap" - paying back over many more years the price of preventing economic catastrophe five years ago. The artificial lowering of interest rates via QE clearly prevented a deeper economic bust in 2008/2009, he reckons. But the net result of depressed rates has been to slow and elongate any recovery as each pop in economic activity leads to minor but unsustainable interest rate rebounds that choke the upturn. "It is a QE trap. It means the recovery will be slower, but does it have to end in tears? Not necessarily," he said, adding persistence and fine tuning by central banks can manage the process over the long term. Marino Valensise, CIO at the $60 billion Baring Asset Management, echoes this: "The issue is whether the authorities will now ever be able to just pull the plug on QE." If they can't, it will rankle. "You could be locked in QE for longer if we see significant slippage on the inflation front and that has the potential to exaggerate some of the distortions that have occurred," said Philip Saunders at Investec Asset Management. "I personally think that QE is counterproductive. Its social impact is indefensible. The price for supposedly creating a few more jobs is that basically you make the rich a lot richer through asset price inflation." Saunders reckons some wage inflation has to be allowed to come through after "five years with the clamps on" and this may help offset some of QE distortions. But reversing QE itself may simply not be an option. "They have no choice," said Amundi's Blanque. "There are far more risks attached to 'normalization'." (Editing by Ron Askew)
Goldman Sachs is slowly releasing their best ideas for 2014.   The first two are attached below.  If you have some ideas for 2014 feel free to share with the group.  Here’s Goldman’s first two (via WSJ MoneyBeat): “Long 5-Year Eonia/Short 5-Year U.S. Treasurys.”  “The market reaction to the strengthening of ‘forward guidance’ could, contrary to our expectations, be associated with a flattening of the two-to-five year U.S. curve, at least initially. … “Currently, a very accommodative monetary policy stance is largely priced in in the U.S., while the market is underestimating the possibility that the European Central Bank can provide further easing, even by cutting the deposit rate below zero,” “Long S&amp;P 500/Short AUD” “This reflects what is perhaps the largest overarching theme of our market outlook – a belief that developed-market equities are well placed as long as US yields do not rise too quickly. The specific implementation of this trade recommendation that we will track is a long position in Dec 2014 S&amp;P 500 futures, and a corresponding short position in Dec 2014 AUDUSD futures. Given our forecasts for both assets, with an S&amp;P year-end target of 1900, and a year-end AUD target vs. the USD of 0.85, we see scope for both legs of the trade to generate potential returns.”
Earlier this week a meme spread around the internet that half of new HIV infections in Greece were the result of people purposely trying to get infected to get more government benefits. That turned out to be total nonsense, and the result of a badly worded statement from the World Health Organization, which they apologized for yesterday. But the truth about HIV in Greece is actually depressing. Thanks to the crisis and an increase in drug use, there has been a surge in HIV cases in recent years. Macropolis has the charts showing the rise in reported cases. Macropolis So no, this is not some case of people purposely trying to get sick to get government money. But the connection between the economic crisis and a crisis of people's health is very real.
Jamie McGeever tweets out this chart from Barclays, in which they asked their investors what worries them the most right now. The top worry is that the Fed reduces stimulus. The second worry is "slowing growth." Both of these are legitimate things to be concerned about, but really what they represent are generic answers that you give in the absence of anything concrete. There's no European collapse to freak out about. China isn't hard landing. There's no obvious reason for a geopolitical flareup that would cause oil to surge. Politics in DC doesn't seem likely to produce a debt default. So you say you're worried about the taper and growth, because that's probably all you can think of these days. And so the market just keeps going up, waiting for the status quo to be rocked by some unknown event at some time that won't be announced. Barclays
BERLIN (AP) â€” Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and Germany's main center-left party reached a deal to form a new government on Wednesday, more than two months after the country's elections. Negotiators from Merkel's Union bloc and the Social Democrats concluded their agreement to form a "grand coalition" of Germany's biggest parties after a final all-night round of talks. Still, a potentially tricky hurdle remains before Merkel can be sworn in for a third term: the Social Democrats are putting the agreement to a ballot of their roughly 470,000 members, some of whom are deeply skeptical about becoming the chancellor's junior partner. The result is expected in mid-December. Merkel won the election on Sept. 22 but her partners in Germany's center-right government of the past four years, the pro-business Free Democrats, lost all their seats in parliament and her conservatives fell short of a majority to govern alone. That left her reaching across the aisle for a new coalition partner. The Social Democrats secured key demands such as the introduction of a mandatory national minimum wage, which Germany is unusual among rich industrial powers in lacking. The 8.50 euro ($11.50) hourly minimum is to be introduced in 2015, but Julia Kloeckner, a deputy leader of Merkel's party, said it won't apply to everyone without exception until the beginning of 2017. In addition, people born and educated in Germany who also hold a passport from a non-European Union country will no longer be obliged to choose one citizenship, a change that will apply largely to the children of Turkish immigrants. Both sides secured changes to the pension system that they had sought, and Kloeckner stressed on ZDF television that "we will have no tax increases, and we will run up no new debts from 2015." The conservatives adamantly refused to raise taxes, which the Social Democrats advocated doing during the election campaign. Negotiators said the parties won't determine who gets what job in the new government until the Social Democrats have completed their membership ballot. That could be tricky because the "grand coalition," while popular among voters, is disliked by party activists â€” and the Social Democrats suffered a heavy electoral defeat in 2009 after serving as Merkel's junior governing party in her first term. The party finished a distant second in this year's vote. "The Social Democratic signature on this coalition agreement is everywhere," senior Social Democratic lawmaker Karl Lauterbach said. He added that "we succeeded on the most important points" but conceded that party leaders will have to overcome "many reservations" among members. In the meantime, Merkel's second-term government remains in office on a caretaker basis. Copyright (2013) Associated Press. All rights reserved.

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson Things have gotten really quiet in the financial world lately. Really quiet.Â There have been no huge up days or down days anywhere really in awhile. And it looks like so far today is no exception. US futures aren't going anywhere. Europe is a little bit higher, but not much. Chinese stocks edged up by 0.8%. Japan fell by a little bit. There's another big slew of data coming out today, including initial jobless claims, but other than that in the financial world, there's not much else and probably won't be until December.
