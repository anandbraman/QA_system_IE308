Julia La Roche for Business InsiderGoldman Sachs strategist David Kostin takes stock of the big trends and themes from this quarter's corporate earnings call in a note called the S&amp;P 500 "Beige Book." Here are the three trends identified by Kostin and his team: Theme 1: Debacle in Washington, DC caused only limited damage The uncertainty surrounding the government shutdown weakened 3Q results by only a small amount. Firms generally dismissed the disruption as short-term and they expect resolution by the end of 1Q 2014. Executives believe uncertainty has suppressed business and consumer confidence. Theme 2: Results in China were disappointing for many firms Many companies reported disappointing 3Q performance in their China divisions. It marked a reversal from the end of 2Q when management optimism on China business prospects was a common theme. Theme 3: Leveraging Technology: Digital media and “big data” Companies across all sectors are focused on increasing brand awareness and image through the use of social media. Other firms look to “big data” to control costs and find efficiencies in an effort to increase margins. The last one might be the most interesting in terms of a big secular story. Investing in social media and big data as a trend that's spreading beyond tech has all kinds of implications. From the note, here are some examples of companies talking about these tech trends. For example, here's something from the McDonald's earnings call: Technology is going to be a big part of our future, particularly digital engagement with consumers. And so you’ll hear us and see us talk about much more digital engagement with consumers. The thing that you’ll see changed a bit is we are being much stronger relative to communicating about our brand, communicating about our food. Customers want to hear more about transparency. And Yum Brands: We’re also leveraging our massive network of employees and suppliers through social media. And here's Schlumberger, talking about big data: Over the past 12 months, we have continued to actively promote our shale reservoir workflow to the market, with a strong focus on optimizing both well locations as well as completion design. As part of these efforts, we have introduced a data consortium business model where multiple customers with neighboring acreage can contribute reservoir and production data and then co-fund field and well studies as well as the construction of 3D reservoir models for the shale plays. And here's Coach: Moving to digital. As mentioned, our North America online business continues to be strong with traffic growing at a double digit pace, driven by engagement from tablet and mobile devices, which represents over 50% of our site visits. Optimization of these devices has been a key focus for us, creating more compelling customer experiences. Of course, to some extent, there's probably an element of companies talking up their affinity for the latest buzzwords. But still, to the extent that these are trends worth talking about, it could represent real dollar shifts in terms of how these companies invest and promote themselves.

REUTERS/Dave Kaup We recently told you how falling gasoline prices provided a cushion to the U.S. economy during the government shutdown Now Macroeconomic Advisers has further quantified the gains from falling fuel costs. In a new note, they revise their Q3 GDP estimate up 3/10ths to a "solid" 2.7%. A major reason, they say, is lower-than-expected consumer prices, thanks in part to declines in gasoline: Falling energy prices are contributing to gains in real wealth and income: Retail gasoline prices have declined more than 30 cents / gallon over the last two months, to $3.28/gallon as of Thursday, according to the national average pump price compiled for AAA. November gasoline futures have declined by a similar amount. We estimate that the CPI for gasoline declined by roughly 3% to 4% in October, after seasonal adjustment. If retail prices hold near current levels, the CPI for gasoline in November would be roughly unchanged after seasonal adjustment. Over the last eight weeks, the spot price of WTI has declined approximately $15 to near $95/barrel. They go on to say that final sales to private domestic purchasers will improve from 2.3% in Q3 to 3.2% in Q4 thanks to a jump to 3% from 1.7% in personal consumption expenditures, which in turn should be, "aided by falling energy prices and large increases in housing and equity wealth." The group is holding Q4 GDP forecasts at 1.7%, citing "the government shutdown, ongoing and previously anticipated declines in federal spending, and a negative swing in inventory investment that we expect will subtract approximately 3/4 of a percentage point from GDP growth." Overall, they say, GDP growth will remain "moderate in the near term."
ReutersThe New York Times' Justin Gillis reportsÂ on a soon-to-be-released study that predicts climate change will cut food production by 2% each decade through the rest of the century. Meanwhile, global food demand is projected to rise 14% over the same period. The latest findings, from the U.N.'s Nobel-winning Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change (IPCC), represent a gloomier outlook than their last major study in 2007, Gillis says. The study was first leaked onÂ a blogÂ critical of the IPCC's work and was not set to be published until March, by which time the findings could change.Â  In the unofficial report, the panel now believes that crops are not as resilient to heat as once believed, although no mention is made of last year's epic U.S. drought, which is not believed to have resulted from climate change: While [the 2007 study] did warn of risks and potential losses in output, particularly in the tropics, that report found that gains in production at higher latitudes would most likely offset the losses and ensure an adequate global supply. The new tone reflects a large body of research in recent years that has shown howÂ sensitive cropsÂ appear to be to heat waves. The recent work also challenges previous assumptions about how much food production could increase in coming decades because of higher carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere. The gas, though it is the main reason for global warming, also acts as a kind of fertilizer for plants. The latest study does acknowledge that some previously non-arable regions could see some benefits, but not enough to overcome losses elsewhere.Â Tropical and temperate regions stand to be hardest hit.

Credit SuisseCredit Suisse global equity strategist Andrew Garthwaite.Despite numerous headwinds, the stock market has been incredibly resilient in 2013, and the S&amp;P 500 is up over 23% year-to-date. In his latest note to clients, Credit Suisse global equity strategist Andrew Garthwaite identifies four catalysts for a correction in the stock market: Overall, we continue to believe that equities would have a meaningful correction (i.e. 10% or more) only after one of the following events occurs: (1) There is a clear monetary shock with interest rates rising: we think this is likely to be a mid-2015 event in the US; (2) Equities become clearly expensive against bonds (i.e. the US 10-year bond yield rises above 3.5%); (3) Risk appetite indicators hit euphoria; (4) A global macro shock (the most likely candidates being a sharper-than-expected slowdown in China or political shocks in peripheral Europe). Despite the lack of any real threats to stocks on the radar from Garthwaite's point of view, the strategist believes the S&amp;P 500's advance will stagnate in the near term: We stick to our long-standing overweight of equities and our end-2014 target of 1,900 on the S&amp;P 500. Markets have surpassed our end-2013 target (of 1,730 on the S&amp;P 500) and we see a heightened risk of near-term consolidation as:  â–  Some tactical indicators are signalling caution: The bull/bear ratio, director selling, and the gap between sector risk appetite and overall risk appetite have all reached extreme levels associated with marginal market falls on our back-tests. In addition, corporate net buying has slowed to zero (from 3% of market cap), again a precursor to consolidation.  â–  Earlier Fed tapering than the market expects: we agree with our US economics team that tapering is more likely to start in January than in March, largely because the market is too pessimistic on 2014 US growth prospects.  â–  Earnings revisions have underperformed macro momentum.  â–  Growth momentum: macro surprises have yet to recover post their September fall, but we think they will.  "However, we stress that the risk is consolidation in the near term, not a correction and we believe that markets in 6 and 12 months' time will be significantly higher," concludes Garthwaite. "Hence, we stick to our overweight of equities."
REUTERS/Bobby YipA croupier sits in front of a gaming table inside a casino in Macau.MACAU (Reuters) - The media scrum surrounding the politically connected chairman of a Chinese financial services company was interested in one particular unpaid loan. The amount - $1.3 million - was nothing extraordinary. But the story behind it was. Xie Xiaoqing, chairman of Rongzhong Group, was sued in January for failing to repay the money to Sands China Ltd, U.S. billionaire Sheldon Adelson's Macau gambling unit. Xie has said he wasn't gambling and the money was for a friend. A spokesman for his company said Xie was not available to comment. For many years, politically linked tycoons and government officials were frequently spotted betting millions in the southern Chinese city's lavish VIP rooms. But their numbers have dwindled because of an anti-corruption campaign led by China's new leader Xi Jinping. Just a few years ago, that might have devastated Macau, which typically generated 70 percent of its revenues from high rollers including wealthy government officials. In the third quarter those big whales accounted for just 65 percent, according to government data, the lowest share since 2006. Yet annual revenues are on a pace to rise 16 percent to $44 billion - seven times what Las Vegas took in last year - and October's numbers smashed analysts' forecasts, jumping 32 percent to a record $4.6 billion. Middle-class mass-market gamblers have taken up the slack at just the right moment, and some of those government officials are still finding their way in, albeit more quietly. "It is much stricter with the leadership change," said Li, a Macau junket operator who helps organize high rollers' travel and hotel arrangements and asked to be identified only by his surname. "They (officials) keep a low profile and stay in service apartments arranged by other people" instead of opulent casino suites, complete with massage rooms and karaoke parlors, that they once preferred. Interviews with more than a dozen casino executives, government officials, junket operators and industry analysts show Macau is learning to live with closer scrutiny from Beijing. Most sources asked for anonymity or to be identified by only one name because of the sensitive topic of corruption. TOMORROW IS EVEN BETTER Beijing is both subtly and openly making its presence known in Macau, a tiny metropolis about one-third the size of Manhattan, spread across a densely populated cluster of three land masses. Across from Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd's gold turreted casino on Macau's Las Vegas-style Cotai strip stands a gleaming new People's Liberation Army building. Billboards hoisted next to the towering structure depict armed soldiers on guard with the caption, "Macau tomorrow is even better". Beijing is also deepening ties with casinos and the junket operators that bring in the wealthy VIPs by helping to arrange their gambling credit and collecting their debts. New regulations put in place over the past year in Macau require junkets and casinos to report suspicious transactions and player lists each month, including details of when they played and how much they won or lost. Macau is set to implement a new money laundering law next year which may allow authorities to freeze and seize assets. This close scrutiny is a sharp change from just a decade ago, when violent gangs controlled the VIP gaming rooms and street crime was a regular occurrence. "In the early days it was pretty much anything goes," said a former executive at the Venetian Macau, a glamorous casino, hotel and luxury shopping centre owned by Sands. "It really was the Wild West. There really was very limited, if any control." Government officials would typically visit Macau for leisure or personal business, using fake passports or special permits which gave them easy access, according to junket and casino executives. Since the corruption crackdown, officials have been finding some creative ways to avoid detection. Macau casinos have some of the most sophisticated surveillance technology yet spotting officials gambling on the property can still be difficult, said a senior executive at one of Macau's newly opened resorts. "There are some low-ranking officials from state-owned enterprises who still come but if they have fake identification it is very difficult for us to spot," the executive said. In one recent example, casino workers caught an official whose passport had two different birth dates. Some officials are getting their gambling fix without setting foot in Macau, placing bets by calling someone sitting at a baccarat table and giving verbal instructions, said a junket operator who gave his English name as Mark. The VIP segment isn't going away. Macau's 35 casinos still rake in big bucks from these gamblers who drop 1 million yuan ($164,100) on a typical visit. But the high rollers are now more likely to be wealthy private businessman rather than government officials and politically connected tycoons. Zhonglu Zeng, a professor at Macau's Polytechnic University who co-authored a study on high rollers from mainland China, said although the total number of high rollers are now bigger than before, the proportion is now heavily skewed to private business owners than officials. Academics estimate that government officials now comprise perhaps 3 percent of VIP room visitors, down from about 30 percent 3 years ago. FAMILY-FRIENDLY MACAU Gaming taxes generate 80 percent of Macau's government revenues, and both Beijing and local authorities are keen to diversify. Professor Gao Peiyong, director of the National Academy of Economic Strategy told local media last week that the proportion of gaming tax making up financial revenue "is too large to be healthy." Casinos have been under pressure by Macau authorities to expand non-gaming amenities to attract families and a wider traveler base. Upcoming tourist-friendly events include the Grand Prix, a high-profile boxing match featuring Manny Pacquiao and celebrity award shows. Sands signed a deal with DreamWorks Animation in April which allows the casino to use characters including Shrek and Po from Kung Fu Panda. Costumed employees regularly roam the lobby and shopping centers, interacting with customers. Manuel Neves, head of Macau's gaming body the DICJ, said the ultimate aim is to emulate Las Vegas's feat of generating as much revenue from outside the casinos as inside. "The transformation is big and fast. We still depend a lot on gaming. With the gaming tax the government can do a lot of things, one is to push the other activities," he said.

REUTERS/Steve Marcus The FT's Kara Scannell reports that hedge fund behemoth SAC Capital will plead guilty to criminal insider trading charges as soon as Monday and face a $1 billion fine. The firm had beenÂ indicted in July. Scannell writes that the plea basically means SAC is finished: As a result of the guilty plea SAC will effectively shut as a firm managing other peopleâ€™s money and close the door on Mr Cohenâ€™s enviable success as a money manager. ... Nearly all of its $6bn from pension funds and wealthy individuals will be returned by the end of the year. It has said it will close its London office and has let go numerous employees. The fate of fund founder Steve Cohen, who still faces civil charges, remains unknown, Scannell says, but the SEC still wants to ban him from the securities industry. The FBI is still investigating trades by Cohen and other SAC execs, she writes. At its height, SAC had $15 billion assets under management, and Cohen was said to be worth $9.4 billion.Â Â  Read the full story at FT.com Â»
ReutersIt's a long way from Beijing to Belgravia but London's upmarket estate agents would be well advised to keep a close eye on developments in China over the next 10 days. The price of a mansion in London's more fashionable districts is rising fast. Cash buyers from overseas have snapped up houses with little or no regard of the cost, creating a property microclimate divorced from the rest of the market. The Bank of England is keeping tabs on the boom, concerned that the flood of foreign cash pushing up the price of mansions could â€“ if left unchecked â€“ herald the start of the next bubble. Well, you ain't seen nothing yet. The freeing up of China's economy over the past 35 years has been methodical. First it was agriculture. Then it was industry. Now, the next phase of liberalisation planned by the ruling cadre of the Communist party includes finance. A host of possible reforms are being considered. These include offering higher interest rates for domestic savers backed up by deposit insurance for savings accounts and making China's currency, the renminbi, convertible. Unfettered movement of capital out of China is not going to happen overnight, but it could happen within five to 10 years. That's why George Osborne was in China last month seeking to make London the global hub for dealings in the renminbi. That is why fund managers, hedge funds, private equity firms and property specialists in Britain are licking their lips. China's leaders have encouraged speculation that radical change is afoot by talking about a "masterplan" for the economy. There have been signs that Beijing is prepared to sacrifice quantity for quality: accepting that growth needs to be slower but more sustainable. Although living standards have risen sharply, China's economic model is investment-intensive. There has been a rapid expansion of industrial capacity to provide goods for export. Heavy debts have been incurred in the process, particularly by local government. The sluggish recovery in the global economy that followed the financial crisis of 2007-08 means that demand for China's manufactured products is growing less quickly than it once was. Hence the feeling that the economy needs more of a domestic focus and that capital should be used less wastefully. The internal debates about the future of the economy will come to a head next weekend when the central committee of the Communist party meets in its third plenary session since it was elected for a five-year term in 2012. Historically, the so-called third plenum has been the occasion for the party hierarchy to focus on the economy, followed by big shifts in policy. It was at the third plenum in 1978 that Deng Xiaoping announced the opening up of the Chinese economy: the move that triggered 35 years of stupendous growth. Fifteen years later, Deng said the economy needed more investment and had to become more export-focused. Within a decade, the country's success in breaking into western markets was crowned by admission into the World Trade Organisation. WTO membership, together with a period in the early 2000s when the global economy was expanding at its fastest rate since the late 1960s and early 1970s, meant there was little pressure to reform China's economy. It was hard to argue with growth rates of 10% and record rates of poverty reduction. Now, though, expectations are high that President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang will act. Analysts at Capital Economics say the third plenum will come up with a direction of travel rather than a detailed policy programme. But they expect the new leadership to address three key issues: the low share of national income going to average households; the dominant role of the state in much of the economy; and the inefficient use of capital. Xi and Li are likely to proceed with caution. There will be strong opposition to reform from vested interests who like the status quo. What's more, China's fragile financial sector needs handling with care. The balance sheets of commercial banks and the shadow banking sector are bloated with loans to state-owned enterprises and real estate companies. Many of these loans are non-performing, and there are enough parallels between China today and the United States half a dozen years ago if Beijing wishes to observe the consequences of over-hasty or badly sequenced reforms. Even so, the feeling seems to be that ducking the need for change will merely store up even bigger problems for the future. Deregulation, land reform and a strengthening of the social security system are on the agenda. But it will be financial reform that will be of most interest to the outside world. There has been liberalisation in this sector but Capital Economics says this is set to accelerate by allowing the renminbi to operate in a wider trading band, allowing full private ownership of banks, facilitating the development of the corporate bond market and loosening curbs on cross-border capital flows. In the US, there has been much agonising over the emergence of China as a rival economic superpower. America's trade deficit with China has been a particular cause of concern, with Beijing accused of manipulating the renminbi exchange rate to dump goods in the west. Fears have been expressed that America is vulnerable to a financial Pearl Harbor: a sudden decision by Beijing to stop buying US Treasury bills. In the light of what is going to be discussed later this week, such fears look overblown. That's not just because such a move would be a pyrrhic victory for China, since it would destroy the value of its assets. It's also because bit by bit, China's economy â€“ if not its political structure â€“ is being reshaped along the lines sought by Wall Street and by American-owned transnational corporations. Back in the late 1990s, US multinationals demanded that China accept more stringent conditions than had been imposed on other developing countries in order to secure WTO membership. Beijing accepted. Now America wants two things: China's financial sector to be opened up to US banks and the country's savings to boost western capital markets. More than likely, Washington will get its way, perhaps not immediately but with profound effects. Why? Well, consider this. America, the world's biggest economy, has savings of $2.8tn (Â£1.7tn); China has more than $4tn. As a result, the impact of financial liberalisation in China will make the flow of funds into the west from Russian oligarchs look inconsequential. As Diana Choyleva of Lombard Street Research notes, China's elite already sends its children to Britain to be educated. The money is about to follow. Which is why the hedge-fund owners of Mayfair and the estate agents of Belgravia have every reason to be cheerful. This article originally appeared on guardian.co.uk 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Now is when Americans start figuring out that President Barack Obama's health care law goes beyond political talk, and really does affect them and people they know. With a cranky federal website complicating access to new coverage and some consumers being notified their existing plans are going away, the potential for winners and losers is creating anxiety and confusion. "I've had questions like, 'Are they going to put me in jail if I don't buy insurance? Because nobody will sell it to me,'" said Bonnie Burns, a longtime community-level insurance counselor from California. "We have family members who are violently opposed to 'Obamacare' and they are on Medicaid â€” they don't understand that they're already covered by taxpayer benefits. "And then there is a young man with lupus who would have never been insurable," Burns continued. "He is on his parents' plan and he'll be able to buy his own coverage. They are very relieved." A poll just out from the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation documents shifts in the country in the month since insurance sign-ups began. Fifty-five percent now say they have enough information to understand the law's impact on their family, up 8 percentage points in just one month. Part of the reason is that advertising about how to get coverage is beginning to register. "The law is getting more and more real for people," said Drew Altman, the foundation's president. "A lot of this will turn on whether there's a perception that there have been more winners than losers. ... It's not whether an expert thinks something is a better insurance policy, it's whether people perceive it that way." A look at three groups impacted by the law's rollout: ___ LOSING CURRENT PLAN The Obama administration insists nobody will lose coverage as a result of cancellation notices going out to millions of people. At least 3.5 million Americans have been issued cancellations, but the exact number is unclear. Associated Press checks find that data is unavailable in a half the states. Mainly they are people who buy directly from an insurer, instead of having workplace coverage. Officials say these consumers aren't getting "canceled" but "transitioned" or "migrated" to better plans because their current coverage doesn't meet minimum standards. They won't have to go uninsured, and some could save a lot if they qualify for the law's tax credits. Speaking in Boston's historic Faneuil Hall this past week, Obama said the problem is limited to fewer than 5 percent of Americans "who've got cut-rate plans that don't offer real financial protection in the event of a serious illness or an accident." But in a nation of more than 300 million, 5 percent is a big number â€” about 15 million people. Among them are Ian and Sara Hodge of Lancaster, Pa., in their early 60s and paying $1,041 a month for a policy. After insurer Highmark, Inc., sent the Hodges a cancellation notice, the cheapest rate they say they've been able to find is $1,400 for a comparable plan. Ian is worried they may not qualify for tax credits, and doesn't trust that the federal website is secure enough to enter personal financial information in order to find out. "We feel like we're being punished for doing the right thing," he said. Their policy may not have met the government's standards, "but it certainly met our minimum standards," Hodge added. "The main thing that upsets us is the president ... said over and over and over again: If you like your health plan, you will be able to keep your health plan, guaranteed." There's a chance the number of people getting unwanted terminations may grow. In 2015, the law's requirement that larger companies provide health insurance will take effect. It's expected that a small share of firms will drop coverage, deciding that it's cheaper to pay fines imposed under the law. ___ GAINING COVERAGE Before the law's online health care markets launched Oct. 1, the administration estimated nearly 500,000 people would enroll for subsidized private insurance within the first month. Despite high consumer interest, a computer system beset by gremlins has kept most from doing so. The administration refuses to release enrollment numbers until mid-November, when a crash program of computer fixes may be showing results. The numbers are expected to be disappointingly low; officials acknowledge as much. A different prong of Obama's coverage expansion seems to be doing fairly well. It's an expanded version of Medicaid, embraced so far by 25 states and the District of Columbia. An informal survey of 14 of those states by The Associated Press shows that at least 240,000 people had enrolled in or applied for the expanded safety-net program as of the third week of October. Private coverage is what interests Cecilia Fontenot of Houston, a part-time accountant in her early 60s. She has diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Though she manages well, she has been unable to find affordable insurance. Under Obama's law, insurers will not be able to turn away people with medical problems or charge them more. Fontenot gave up on HealthCare.gov and instead applied through a call center on Oct. 19. "They said it may take a while because so many people had called in," Fontenot explained. "I'm a very patient person, and I'm looking forward to getting that insurance." She wants a plan that covers a better diabetes drug than the one she can afford now by paying out of pocket. Her doctor has also recommended a high-tech imaging test for a breast lump. ___ WONDERING WHETHER COVERAGE WILL CHANGE Americans are still divided over the Affordable Care Act, with negative views outweighing positives. But they also lean against repealing it. The final judgment may be in the hands of people who now have employer-provided health insurance. They're about half the population, and they've noted Obama's assurances that their coverage won't be disrupted. Up to now, the changes for employer plans have been incremental. They tend to expand benefits, not take things away. For example, young adults can stay on a parent's coverage until they turn 26. Employers cover women's birth control as a preventive service, free of charge. Screening tests such as colonoscopies are also free. But cost control provisions, mainly a tax on expensive insurance plans that starts in 2018, are converging with the long-standing push by employers to tame health costs. Some companies have raised deductibles and copayments for employees, saying they need to scale back to avoid tangling with the coming tax. Others are giving employees a fixed amount of money to shop in private health insurance markets that resemble those created by the law. Expect cutbacks to be blamed on the law. Sorting out whether that's warranted may be difficult. "What the Affordable Care Act did was give companies a very convenient excuse to say 'Oh, gosh, we really have to get serious about insurance costs,'" said Paul Keckley, an independent health benefits consultant. "I think there's a bit of a bob and weave. The ACA was a convenient excuse for doing what (corporate) human resources departments have been calculating to do for years." ___ Associated Press writer Michael Rubinkam in Allentown, Pa., contributed to this report.

Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, has long argued that people should be 100% in stocks. So, people noticed when Fink warned this week that the markets are looking "bubble-like." On Friday, Bloomberg's Eric Schatzker caught up with the CEO of another financial behemoth: Morgan Stanley's James Gorman. Gorman was pretty comfortable disagreeing with Fink's take. Here's the transcript from Bloomberg Television: On Larry Fink saying that he is seeking bubble-like markets again and whether he agrees:  "Not really, no. I don't. I see the equity markets. The S&amp;P is trading at 1700 and change. It is frankly not bubble like relative to the year 2000, 2005, 1995 and so on. On the equity markets, no. There's a lot of robustness. The indices have rebounded tremendously, but from very low levels. There has been a flood of money out there through the quantitative easing program. It has been necessary to get this country back in balance, so no, I'm not sure I'd share that view." On whether he agrees that the longer the Fed keeps quantitative easing in place, the greater the risk of bubbles: "The reason they're keeping it in place is because the economy is not growing. The economy is not doing what it is supposed to do, which is creating jobs. We should all celebrate the day they start tapering because it means the Fed, with all the resources they have, have a fundamental view that employment is back to where Chairman Bernanke said it should be, which is 6.5% or better." Some market-watchers have pointed to Robert Shiller's famous cyclically-adjusted price-earnings ratio as signaling a bubble. But Jefferies' Sean Darby dismantled that thesis earlier this week. Sooner or later, we'll see who's right.
A new survey of family offices by Citi finds that the wealthy are cash heavyâ€”meaning they may fall short of the investment returns they're expecting. Wealthy families have about 39 percent of their assets in cash, according to aÂ recent pollÂ of more than 50 large family office representatives from 20 countries conducted by Citi Private Bank. Stocks represented about 25 percent of portfolios on average. Bonds were about 17 percent of the asset mix and various classes of less liquid and alternative investments amounted to 19 percent. "Using these weightings, our own return expectation for the portfolio â€¦ comes to just 4.4 percent. This matches what we at Citi Private Bank observe generally among high end investors: very high cash holdings, with a current asset allocation unlikely to achieve return targets," Steven Wieting, the bank's global chief investment strategist, wrote in a recent client note. Most of the families surveyed expected interest rates to rise. About 60 percent projected long-term market rates to rise 50 basis points and 17 percent said they would increase 100 basis points or more. Just 2 percent expected U.S. rates to fall. (Read more: Is the US market fully priced?) The families were also asked if U.S. stocks were more likely to rise or fall 10 percent over the coming year. Some 65 percent expected a gain. "What does this all suggest?" Wieting asked. "In our view, under-invested bulls." All of Citi Private Bank clients are worth at least $25 million and the unit oversees about $270 billion in combined assets. A similar survey of ultrarich investors was more optimistic. Members of Tiger 21, an information-sharing network for investors with a median net worth of $75 million, haven't reduced their healthy allocation to bonds and equities and they hold relatively little cash, according to a recent survey of portfolio positioning in the third quarter. (Read more:Â What coming correction? No rush to cash among ultrawealthy) Citi is more bullish than its clients. "Our own future equity return expectations are positive, but well short of the pace seen over the past five years as market valuations are now far from depressed. However, in the recovery to date, investors have doubted the sustainability of huge profit gains seen at the start of the U.S.rebound," Wieting said. "Our interpretation of the current market pricing is that in the years ahead, U.S. equity markets can likely absorb a gradual rise in risk-free interest rates, assuming the source of the rise is increased growth expectations, or alternatively, confidence in the sustainability of growth."

The consensus seems to be that the FOMC will wait until 2014 to start to taper QE purchases. As an example, from Michael Hanson at Merrill Lynch: The thresholds to taper are not as high as some think, but we see a relatively low chance that the data will be strong enough to allow tapering in time for the holidays. ... [T]he Fed needs to see the economy move toward the “tolerable twos” to taper: growth in the upper-2% range, closer to job gains of 200,000 per month, and inflation converging (even if slowly) toward the 2% target. That is a heavy burden by the December meeting, but if the post-shutdown data rebound, January remains possible — as do the next several meetings afterwards. And as we have said before, time will tell. And analysts at Nomura have put the odds of a "taper" in December at just 15%, and they view March 2014 as the most likely meeting for the FOMC to start reducing asset purchases. So what would it take for the FOMC to taper in December? First we have to remember the FOMC was close to tapering in September. From the September FOMC statement: Taking into account the extent of federal fiscal retrenchment, the Committee sees the improvement in economic activity and labor market conditions since it began its asset purchase program a year ago as consistent with growing underlying strength in the broader economy. However, the Committee decided to await more evidence that progress will be sustained before adjusting the pace of its purchases. Although not mentioned in the FOMC statement, at the September press conference Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke suggested that one of the reasons the Fed didn't taper was that they wanted to see the results of the budget negotiations.   Now those "negotiations" are behinds us (for now), and although the government shutdown was expensive and dumb, at least there wasn't any additional fiscal restraint added. Here is what I think it would take to taper at the meeting of Dec. 17 and 18. 1) The unemployment rate probably increased sharply in October (due to the shutdown), but the impact of the shutdown will be reversed in the November report that will be released on Friday, Dec. 6.  If the unemployment rate declines back to 7.2% or so in November (the September rate), then the FOMC might taper. 2) As Merrill's Hanson noted, the FOMC would probably also be looking to see employment growth close to 200,000 in the November report.   If the year-over-year change in employment is still around 2.2 million for November, the FOMC might taper. 3) The FOMC is also concerned that inflation is too low. From the October FOMC statement: The Committee recognizes that inflation persistently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance, but it anticipates that inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term. The PCE price index for October will be released on Dec. 5 (the September PCE index will be released this week).  If PCE prices are moving back towards 2%, the FOMC might taper.  Note: CPI for November will be released on Dec. 17 and might influence the decision. 4) On fiscal policy, the budget conference committee is scheduled to present an agreement on Dec. 13 (just before the FOMC meeting).  The committee is expected to play "small ball," so it is possible an agreement is reached.  If a reasonable agreement is reached (hopefully reduce the impact of the sequester in 2014), then the FOMC might be more inclined to taper.  If it appears that the House might shut down the government again, the FOMC will be inclined to wait. There are many key releases right at the beginning of December, and we know the Fed is "data dependent."  So, here is what the FOMC would like to see to start tapering: 1) The unemployment rate fall to 7.2% in the November report, 2) Employment up about 2.2 million year-over-year in November, 3) Inflation increasing toward 2% target, and 4) Some sort of fiscal agreement by Dec. 13.  All possible.
The US Congress on Friday allowed an estimated $5 billion cut to a federal food stamps program to take effect, slashing the social safety net for the poor, elderly and disabled. Almost 48 million, or one in seven, Americans have had food subsidies cut 13.6 percent after a 2009 recession-fighting measure expired Thursday with no congressional action to extend it. The cuts come as the world's largest economy has still only achieved a tepid recovery from severe recession, marred by persistently high unemployment and budget gridlock in Washington. The cutbacks increase the challenges for Americans struggling to buy food amid a sharply widening income gap between the rich and the poor. And supermarkets and grocery stores were expected to feel the pinch as consumers counted pennies to make the newly stretched ends meet. A household of four will see $36 less a month in benefits, as a maximum $668 allotment is cut to $632, according to the US Department of Agriculture, which runs the program. The government had boosted the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits temporarily in 2009 to help the most vulnerable weather the worst US economic crisis since the 1930s. But the extra SNAP benefits enshrined in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act fell by the wayside this week as a bitterly divided Congress resumed budget negotiations. SNAP is a major part of the five-year Farm Bill, which the Senate and the House of Representatives began negotiating on Wednesday. The Republican-controlled House has been pushing for sharp cutbacks in SNAP spending as part of a budget strategy to reduce the US deficit, while Democrats are seeking smaller cuts. Republican Representative Tim Huelskamp of Kansas, a big farm state, said the SNAP program was bloated. "Eighty percent of the farm bill is now made up of food stamp spending -- which has nearly tripled in the last twelve years," he argued. "The remaining twenty percent is dedicated to traditional farm, conservation, education and other programs. It is absolutely critical that we target and transform food stamps to those in need -- and put the others back to work." "For American families, SNAP provides a lifeline when they face an economic disaster," said Democratic Senator Debbie Stabenow, chair of the Senate's agriculture committee, according to prepared remarks for the opening of the Senate-House negotiations meeting. "For those getting food help, that means every child, every senior citizen, every disabled veteran, every person who's lost their job will have a more difficult time putting food on their tables." House Democrats took to Twitter to protest the SNAP cuts and the impact on the economy. "Food stamp cuts today hit families hard, including 900,000 veterans. And GOP wants to slash even more," wrote Representative Chellie Pingree of Maine. Representative Henry Cuellar of Texas tweeted: "SNAP cuts on Friday leave 48 million Americans with $16 billion less to spend over three years." As of July, 47.6 million people were in the SNAP , an increase of 1.7 percent from a year ago, and monthly benefits rose 0.4 percent to $6.3 billion, USDA data figures showed. The Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan agency for Congress, has said the SNAP program had grown significantly between 2007 and 2012, "largely related to the severe recession and slow recovery." The number of people receiving SNAP benefits jumped from about 26 million to 47 million, and annual spending more than doubled from $35 billion to $80 billion, the CBO said. The center on Budget and Policy Priorities noted that Friday's SNAP cuts mean benefits will average less than $1.40 per person per meal. "This is a serious cut, especially considering that over 80 percent of SNAP participants live in poverty. House and Senate members who are now beginning to negotiate a final Farm Bill should keep this benefit cut in mind as they consider, in reauthorizing the SNAP program, whether to make even deeper cuts," the think tank said.

Flickr / TorbakhopperDave Lutz of Stifel, Nicolaus passes along the topics traders are thinking and reading about this morning over coffee. Here are a few of the key ones that have stood out and summarized by us.
The stock market is at an all-time high. Tech startups with no revenue have billion-dollar valuations. And engineers are demanding Tesla sports cars just to show up at work. Here's the evidence that we're in a new tech bubble, heading for a crash, just like the dot com bust of 1999. Fred / Think ProgressBefore we get into specific evidence that the tech sector is inflated, it's worth restating the macro-economic context: Interest rates are basically at zero and have been for some time. When borrowers are paying close to zero interest on loans, that makes money cheap to get. This chart shows the Fed's target rate for interest since 1970. People with money generally have a choice: save it in interest-paying, risk-free bank accounts or invest it in riskier assets that may pay more money over time. When interest is at zero, virtually any other kind of investment is likely to pay more because the risk-free alternative is so lousy. So investment asset bubbles get created. Stocks tend to go up. Yahoo Finance / Jim EdwardsWe've had five years of solid growth in stocks. People who have invested in stocks in the last five years now feel very, very rich. What could possibly go wrong? The market moves up and down, in cycles, as this chart of the S&amp;P 500 stocks shows. We're due for a downturn. (BlackRock CEO Laurence D. Fink, whose company manages $4.1 trillion in assets, agrees that the Federal Reserve is creating “bubble-like markets.”) Thomson Reuters / PricewaterhouseCoopersThis chart was published by PriceWaterhouseCoopers, which tracks merger and acquisition activity in the tech sector. It notes that "software deal volume tripled that of the second quarter." The driving force? High stock prices and corporate giants who are rich with cash and need to invest it, PwC says. While unemployment generally may be high, in the tech sector it is very low. REUTERS/Edgar Su Tech companies, led by Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook, are lobbying Congress to relax immigration rules so they can hire more foreign talent because they believe domestic talent has gotten too scarce and too expensive. It's driving up wages bills like crazy. Matt Allen, a tech recruiter at Vertical Move, told me recently: We're experiencing first hand greater insanity than the dot-com days when Interwoven Software was pulling out BMW Z3's for engineers who joined. Instead, we're seeing sign-on bonuses for individuals five-years out of school in the $60,000 range. Candidates queuing-up six, eight or more offers and haggling over a few thousand-dollar differences among the offers. Engineers accepting offers and then fifteen minutes before they're supposed to start on a Monday, emailing (not calling) to explain they found something better elsewhere. That suggests that wages in tech are in a bubble. Want an example? TwitterTwitter's Chris Fry comes with a high price.Fry is paid more in annual compensation that Jack Dorsey, the chairman of Twitter's board and the founder of the company. That's how much the price of wages has risen in the tech world. Fry is not a one-off event. Facebook's vp/engineering, Mike Schroepfer, got $24.4 million in 2011, Reuters noted: One start-up offered a coveted engineer a year's lease on a Tesla sedan, which costs in the neighborhood of $1,000 a month, said venture capitalist Venky Ganesan. He declined to identify the company, which his firm has invested in. Supercell, the game company, just raised $1.5 billion in new funding at a valuation of $3 billion. Supercell has real revenue — $178 million in Q1 alone. But you've got to question the logic of the people doing the deal: Investor Masayoshi Son, the founder of Softbank, believes he has a "300-year vision" of the future. Even the CEO of Supercell thought he was joking when he first heard about it. Jason / Goldberg / FacebookFab CEO Jason GoldbergFab.com, the design retailer, recently raised $165 million in new investment this year, for a total of $336 million in all venture funding. It did so despite laying off 440 employees after deciding that the flash sales model — in which customers are asked to suddenly purchase a daily deal — doesn't work. It was Fab's second business model "pivot" — the company started life as a gay community site. We're not saying Fab is going out of business. We're saying that Fab's backers have been fabulously generous. Natasha Foote / PinterestPinterest just raised $225 million in new investment funding, a stake that values the company at $3.8 billion. That valuation is fictional, of course. It's based on the notion that the company could be sold or go public at that price. That price is 10 times what investors have actually plowed into the company. To be clear, Pinterest is showing every sign of turning into a great company. It has already solidified a role for itself as a key referrer of online retail and e-commerce traffic. But still, this is a company that currently is rumored to make only between $9 million and $45 million in revenue. Snapchat / Apple iTunesSnapchat is rumored to be raising a new round of funding that values the company at $3.6 billion on paper. This company has zero revenues. Zero. And it's not easy to see how it might make money: It's defining product deletes itself after just a few seconds. The last time we saw companies with no revenue receiving high valuations from investors was right before the 1999/2000 dot com crash. Wikimedia, CCTumblr's David Karp and Yahoo's Marissa MayerYahoo recently paid $1.1 billion to acquire Tumblr, the social blog network. Tumblr's revenues are so small Yahoo isn't required to mention them in its financial statements — they just don't move the needle. Again, to be clear, Tumblr is actually an excellent product with 50 million users. But for Yahoo to make money on this deal Tumblr will have to generate profits after sales of greater than $1.1 billion. My sources tell me that with the right adtech, Tumblr could generate several hundred million in ad sales revenue over the years. But they don't believe Yahoo will ever get its money back on the deal. This is significant because Yahoo does not have a good track record when it comes to buying in a bubble. In 1999, right before the last tech crash, it bought Broadcast.com for $5.9 billion in stock and GeoCities for $3.57 billion. Neither business had meaningful revenue and both have since been shuttered. waitscm | FlickrThe New Yorker recently wrote: Hunter Walk, an entrepreneur who recently co-founded an early-phase venture firm called Homebrew, told me about a startup where he’d previously worked. The company had needed to figure out whether to spend its limited budget on beef jerky to keep around the office or 401k plans for the staff. “We put it to a vote: ‘Do you want a 401k or jerky?’ ” he explained. “The vote was unanimously for jerky. The thought was that well-fed developers could create value better than the stock market.” Correction: Walk now tells me that the beef jerky incident happened in 2001. The New Yorker presents the anecdote as if it were current. Nonetheless, there are plenty of companies making dumb decisions. For instance ... Facebook has about 300 so-called Preferred Marketing Developers. They all do one of just four things: Place ads on Facebook, manage Facebook pages for companies, provide social media analytics, and create marketing apps for Facebook. They are basically ad agencies, in the sense that advertising clients hire them to promote their brands via Facebook. But there are more Facebook PMDs than there are major ad agencies in the U.S., even though the non-Facebook ad business is many times the size of Facebook. Not all of these companies will survive, and a few have recently realized that there is not enough money to support them all. Even Facebook has moved to cull the herd. UBSArt CashinArt Cashin, the the director of floor operations for UBS Financial Services, has been around the block. He recently worried that he he was seeing things that reminded him of 1999: "I do worry a little bit that we're beginning to hear things that are reminiscent of the 1999-2000 period—the number of hits, the number of eyeballs," said Cashin, ... "I think if we hold to the old tried-and-true—how many dollars are coming in—then we might be better served," Cashin said. " But people are extrapolating, in some way, in a manner similar to the way they did in 1999-2000."  "For an old fogy like me," the trend of extrapolating future earnings based on users and viewers "gets the warning flags flying," Cashin said. Flickr / coltera Andreessen Horowitz is is the sine qua non of Silicon Valley investor groups. It had stakes in Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Groupon and Zynga. Now it is saying it will no longer invest in early stage consumer-oriented startups. They're done. Andreessen is interested more in later stage and business-to-business-oriented companies. Companies with actual prospects of real revenue, in other words. This, arguably, is the kind of "flight to quality" you often see when asset prices and stocks start falling. What does Andreessen know that we don't? youtube/2millionminutesTim Draper Timothy Draper is the founder of  Draper Fisher Jurvetson, a venture capital outfit that has invested in dozens of tech startups. He's been around since the days when Hotmail was the big new thing. He recently told The New Yorker that he believed tech venture capital may have reached the top of its cycle: “I’ll draw you the cycle,” he said, taking my notepad and pen. He scrawled a large zigzag across the page. “This is a weird shark’s tooth that I kind of came up with. We’ll call it the Emotional Market of Venture Capital, or the Draper Wave.” He labeled all the valleys of the zigzag with the approximate years of low markets and recessions: 1957, 1968, 1974, 1983, and on. The lower teeth he labeled alternately “PE,” for private equity, and “VC,” for venture capital. Draper’s theory is that venture booms always follow private-equity crashes. “After a recession, people lose their jobs, and start thinking, Well, I can do better than they did. Why don’t I start a company? So then they start companies, and interesting things start happening, and then there’s a boom.” Eventually, though, venture capitalists get “sloppy”—they assume that anything they touch will turn to gold—and the venture market crashes. Then private-equity people streamline the system, and the cycle starts again. Right now, Draper suggested, we’re on a venture-market upswing. He circled the last zigzag on his diagram: the line rose and then abruptly ended. "Abruptly ended"? Let's hope he's wrong.
The difference between genius and stupidity is that genius has its limits. â€“ Albert Einstein Genius is a rising stock market. â€“ John Kenneth Galbraith Any plan conceived in moderation must fail when circumstances are set in extremes. â€“ Prince Metternich You can almost feel it in the fall air (unless you are in the Southern Hemisphere). The froth and foam on markets of all shapes and sizes all over the world. It is an exhilarating feeling, and the pundits who populate the media outlets are bubbling over with it. There is nothing like a rising market to help lift our mood. Unless of course, as Prof. Kindleberger famously cautioned (see below), we are not participating in that rising market. Then we feel like losers. But what if the rising market is â€¦ a bubble? Are we smart enough to ride and then step aside before it bursts? Research says we all think that we are, yet we rarely demonstrate the actual ability. This week we'll think about bubbles. Specifically, we'll have a look at part of the chapter on bubbles from my latest book,Â Code Red,Â which we launched last week. At the end of the letter, for your amusement, is a link to a short video of what you might hear if Jack Nicholson were playing the part of Ben Bernanke (or Janet Yellen?) on the witness stand, defending the extreme measures of central banks. A bit of a spoof, in good fun, but there is just enough there to make you wonder what if â€¦ and then smile. Economics can be so much fun if we let it. I decided to use this part of the book when numerous references to bubbles popped into my inbox this week. When these bubbles finally burst, let no one exclaim that they were black swans, unforeseen events. Maybe because we have borne witness to so many crashes and bear markets in the past few decades, we have gotten better at discerning familiar patterns in the froth, reminiscent of past painful episodes. Let me offer you three such bubble alerts that came my way today. The first is from my friend Doug Kass, who wrote: I will address the issue of a stock market bubble next week, but here is a tease and fascinating piece of data: Since 1990, the P/E multiple of the S&amp;P 500Â has appreciated by about 2% a year; in 2013, the S&amp;P's P/E has increased by 18%! Then, from Jolly Olde London, comes one Toby Nangle, of Threadneedle Investments (you gotta love that name), who found the following chart, created a few years ago at the Bank of England. At least when Mervyn King was there they knew what they were doing. In looking at the chart, pay attention to the red line, which depicts real asset prices. As inÂ they knowÂ they are creating a bubble in asset prices and are very aware of how it ends and proceed full speed ahead anyway. Damn those pesky torpedoes. Toby remarks: This is the only chart that Iâ€™ve found that outlines how an instigator of QE believes QEâ€™s end will impact asset prices. The Bank of England published it in Q3 2011, and it tells the story of their expectation that while QE was in operation there would be a massive rise in real asset prices, but that this would dissipate and unwind over time, starting at the point at which the asset purchases were complete.  Oh, dear gods. Really? I can see my friends Nouriel Roubini or Marc Faber doing that chart, but the Bank of England? Really?!? Then, continuing with our puckish thoughts, we look at stock market total margin debt (courtesy of those always puckish blokes at the Motley Fool). They wonder if, possibly, maybe, conceivably, perchance this is a warning sign?  And we wonâ€™t even go into the long list of stocks that are selling for large multiples, not of earnings but of SALES. As in dotcom-era valuations. We make the case inÂ Code RedÂ that central banks are inflating bubbles everywhere, and that even though bubbles are unpredictable almost by definition, there are ways to benefit from them. So, without further ado, letâ€™s look at what co-author Jonathan Tepper and I have to say about bubbles in Chapter 9. Easy Money Will Lead to Bubbles and How to Profit from Them Every year, the Darwin Awards are given out to honor fools who kill themselves accidentally and remove themselves from the human gene pool. The 2009 Award went to two bank robbers. The robbers figured they would use dynamite to get into a bank. They packed large quantities of dynamite by the ATM machine at a bank in Dinant, Belgium. Unhappy with merely putting dynamite in the ATM, they pumped lots of gas through the letterbox to make the explosion bigger. And then they detonated the explosives. Unfortunately for them, they were standing right next to the bank. The entire bank was blown to pieces. When police arrived, they found one robber with severe injuries. They took him to the hospital, but he died quickly. After they searched through the rubble, they found his accomplice. It reminds you a bit of the immortal line from the filmÂ The Italian Jobwhere robbers led by Sir Michael Caine, after totally demolishing a van in a spectacular explosion, shouted at th em, â€œYouâ€™re only supposed to blow the bloody doors off!â€ Central banks are trying to make stock prices and house prices go up, but much like the winners of the 2009 Darwin Awards, they will likely get a lot more bang for their buck than they bargained for. All Code Red tools are intended to generate spillovers to other financial markets. For example, quantitative easing (QE) and large-scale asset purchases (LSAPs) are meant to boost stock prices and weaken the dollar, lower bonds yields, and chase investors into higher-risk assets. Central bankers hope they can find the right amount of dynamite to blow open the bank doors, but it is highly unlikely that theyâ€™ll be able to find just the right amount of money printing, interest rate manipulation, and currency debasement to not damage anything but the doors. Weâ€™ll likely see more booms and busts in all sorts of markets because of the Code Red policies of central banks, just as we have in the past. They donâ€™t seem to learn the right lessons. Targeting stock prices is par for the course in a Code Red world. Officially, the Fed receives its marching orders from Congress and has a dual mandate: stable prices and high employment. But in the past few years, by embarking on Code Red policies, Bernanke and his colleagues have unilaterally added a third mandate: higher stock prices. The chairman himself pointed out that stock markets had risen strongly since he signaled the Fed would likely do more QE during a speech in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, in 2010. â€œI do think that our policies have contributed to a stronger stock market, just as they did in March of 2009, when we did the last iteration [of QE]. The S&amp;P 500 is up about 20 percent plus and the Russell 2000 is up 30 percent plus.â€ It is not hard to see why stock markets rally when investors believe the most powerful central banker in the world wants to print money and see stock markets go up. Investors are thrilled. As Mohamed El-Erian, chief executive officer at Pacific Investment Management Company, said, â€œCentral banks are our best friends not because they like markets, but because they can only get to their macro objectives by going through the markets.â€ Properly reflected on, this is staggering in its implications. A supposedly neutral central bank has decided that it can engineer a recovery by inflating asset prices. The objective is to create a â€œwealth effectâ€ that will make those who invest in stocks feel wealthier and then decide to spend money and invest in new projects. This will eventually be felt throughout the economy. This â€œtrickle-downâ€ monetary policy has been successful in creating wealth for those who were already rich (and for the banks and investment management firms who service them) but has been spectacularly a failure in creating good jobs and a high-growth economy. The latest quarter as we write this letter will be in the 1 percent gross domestic product (GDP) range. And to listen to the speeches from the majority of members of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee, their prescription is more of the same. Indeed, when Bernanke merely hinted this summer that QE might end at some point, something that everyone already knows, the market swooned and a half-a-dozen of his fellow committee members felt compelled to issue statements and speeches the next week, saying, â€œNot really, guys, we really are going to keep it up for a bit longer.â€ Weâ€™ve seen this movie before. In the bookÂ When Money Dies,Â Adam Fergusson quotes from the diary of Anna Eisenmenger, an Austrian widow. In early 1920 Eisenmenger wrote, â€œSpeculation on the stock exchange has spread to all ranks of the population and shares rise like air balloons to limitless heights. ... My banker congratulates me on every new rise, but he does not dispel the secret uneasiness which my growing wealth arouses in me ... it already amounts to millions.â€ Much like after the initial Nixon Shock in the 1970s, stock prices rise rapidly when a currency weakens and money supply grows. Not surprisingly, the 1970s led to bubbles in commodities. This chapter will show how to spot bubbles when they form, how to profit from them, and how to avoid the dire consequences when they burst. Excess Liquidity Creating Bubbles As we writeÂ Code Red, stock prices are roaring ahead. In fact, many asset classes are looking like bubbles from our cheap seats. (While we expect a correction at some point, when the Fed or the Bank of Japan creates money, it has to go somewhere.) One area that stands out as particularly bubbly is the corporate bond market. Investors are barely being compensated for the risks theyâ€™re taking. In 2007, a three-month certificate of deposit yielded more than junk bonds do today. Average yields on investment-grade debt worldwide dropped to a record low 2.45 percent as we write this from 3.4 percent a year ago, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynchâ€™s Global Corporate Index. Veteran investors in high-yield bonds and bank debt see a bubble forming. Wilbur L. Ross Jr., chairman and CEO of WL Ross &amp; Co. has pointed to a â€œticking time bombâ€ in the debt markets. Ross noted that one third of first-time issuers had CCC or lower credit ratings and in the past year more than 60 percent of the high-yield bonds were refinancings. None of the capital was to be used for expansion or working capital, just refinancing balance sheets. Some people think it is good there is no new leveraging, but it is much worse. This means that many companies had no cash on hand to pay off old debt and had to refinance. One day, all the debt will come due, and it will end with a bang. â€œWe are building a bigger time bombâ€ with $500 billion a year in debt coming due between 2018 and 2020, at a point in time when the bonds might not be able to be refinanced as easily as they are today, Mr. Ross said. Government bonds are not even safe because if they revert to the average yield seen between 2000 and 2010, ten year treasuries would be down 23 percent. â€œIf there is so much downside risk in normal treasuries,â€ riskier high yield is even more mispriced, Mr. Ross said. â€œWe may look back and say the real bubble is debt.â€  Another bubble that is forming and will pop is agricultural land in many places in the United States (although agriculture in other countries can be found at compelling values). The bubble really started going once the Fed started its Code Red policies. Land prices in the heart of the Corn Belt have increased at a double-digit rate in six of the past seven years. According to Federal Reserve studies, farmland prices were up 15 percent last year in the most productive part of the Corn Belt, and 26 percent in the western Corn Belt and high plains. Iowa land selling for $2,275 per acre a decade ago is now at $8,700 per acre. As you can see from Figure 9.2, the increase in farmland prices beats almost anything the United States saw during the housing bubble. A lot of banks in the Midwest will have problem with their lending.  Why are we seeing so many bubbles right now? One reason is that the economy is weak and inflation is low. The growth in the money supply doesnâ€™t go to driving up prices for goods like toothpaste, haircuts, or cars. It goes to drive up prices of real estate, bonds, and stocks. Excess liquidity is money created beyond what the real economy needs. In technical terms, Marshallian K is the difference between growth in the money supply and nominal GDP. The measure is the surplus of money that is not absorbed by the real economy. The term is named after the great English economist Alfred Marshall. When the money supply is growing faster than nominal GDP, then excess liquidity tends to flow to financial assets. However, if the money supply is growing more slowly than nominal GDP, then the real economy absorbs more available liquidity. Thatâ€™s one reason why stocks go up so much when the economy is weak but the money supply is rising. It is also why stock markets are so sensitive to any hint that the Fed might ease off on QE. Real players know how the game is played. You can listen to the business media or read the papers and find hundreds of â€œexpertsâ€ saying that stock prices are rising based on fundamentals. You can take their talking points and change the dates and find they are essentially the same as 1999 and 2006â€“2007. (More on the implications of this in Part II when we talk about investing.) The rise in real estate, bonds, and stocks does not count toward any inflation measures. On the desk in his office at Princeton, Einstein once had the words â€œnot everything which can be measured counts, and not everything which counts can be measured.â€ Inflation happens to be one of the things that counts but canâ€™t be measured (except in very narrow terms). Excess liquidity flows from asset class to asset class. As you can see from Figure 9.3, booms and busts around the world happen whenever central banks tighten or loosen monetary policy.  Humans Never Learn Financial bubbles happen frequently. In the 1970s, gold went from $35 to $850 before crashing. In the 1980s, the Japanese Nikkei went from 8,000 to 40,000 before losing 80 percent of its value. In the 1990s, the Nasdaq experienced the dot-com bubble and stocks went from 440 to 5,000 before crashing spectacularly in 2000. The Nasdaq lost 80 percent of its value in less than two years. Many housing bubbles over the past decade in the United Kingdom, United States, Ireland, Spain, and Iceland saw house prices go up 200 and even 500 percent and then lose over half their value in real terms. The U.S. market has had frequent crashes: 1929, 1962, 1987, 1998, 2000, and 2008. Every time, the bubble was driven by different sectors. In 1929, radio stocks were the Internet stocks of their day. In 1962, the electronic sector crashed. The previous year, most electronic stocks had risen 27 percent, with leading technology stocks like Texas Instruments and Polaroid trading at up a crazy 115 times earnings. In 1987, the S&amp;P had risen more than 40 percent in less than a year and over 60 percent in less than two years. In 1998, it was strong expectation on investment opportunities in Russia that collapsed. In 2000, the Internet bubble was so crazy that companies with no earnings and often no real revenues were able to go public, skyrocket, and then crash. Eventually, in all bubbles fundamental values re-assert themselves and markets crash. Economists and investors have spilled a lot of ink describing bubbles, yet central bankers and investors never seem to learn and people get caught up in them. Peter Bernstein inAgainst the GodsÂ states that the evidence â€œreveals repeated patterns of irrationality, inconsistency, and incompetence in the ways human beings arrive at decisions and choices when faced with uncertainty.â€ What is extraordinary is how much bubbles all look alike. The situations were similar in many ways. In the 1920s, the financial boom was fueled by new technologies such as the radio that supposedly would change the world. In the 1990s, the stock market rose on the rapid adoption of the Internet. Both technologies were going to fundamentally change the world. Stocks like RCA in the 1920s and Yahoo in the 1990s were darlings that went up like rockets. Figure 9.4 plots the two charts against each other. The similarities and timing of market moves are uncanny.  If you look at Figure 9.5, you can see the gold bubble in the 1970s. (Some academics have noted that the surge in gold prices closely followed the increase in inflation in the late 1970s, reflecting its value as a hedge against inflation. When inflation fell in the 1980s, gold prices followed. So it is an open question whether gold in the 1970s should be considered a bubble.)  Fast-forward 10 years, and you can see from Figure 9.6 that the bubble in the Japanese Nikkei looked almost exactly the same.  Bubbles happen again and again. The same basic ingredients are found every time: fueled initially by well-founded economic fundamentals, investors develop a self-fulfilling optimism by herding that leads to an unsustainable accelerating increase in prices. And each time people are surprised that a bubble has happened. As billionaire investor George Soros once said about financial cycles: â€œThe only surprise is that we are always surprised.â€ For example, the corporate bond market appears to be in another bubble. â€œWe have a hyper-robust bond market right now,â€ Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher, a former investment manager, said in an interview. These robust markets are part of the Fed's policy intent, he said, but the credit market jump has put him on guard for a new destabilizing credit boom. â€œYou donâ€™t sit on a hot stove twice.â€ Economists and investors, though, repeatedly sit on hot stoves. Economic researchers have managed to create bubbles in laboratories. Economist Reshmaan N. Hussam and his colleagues not only managed to create bubbles once, they managed to bring the same subjects back in for the same experiment and still managed to reproduce bubbles. It didnâ€™t matter if people were given fundamental information regarding what was available or not. It didnâ€™t matter how financially sophisticated the participants were either: corporate managers, independent small business people, or professional stock traders. No one was immune from re-creating bubbles. It seems that everyone is born a sucker. As humans, we developed our instincts dodging lions and chasing antelopes on the African savannah over hundreds of thousands of years. Now it seems we chase asset prices. It is as if we are hard-wired to respond to movement in what market we are following. The conclusion from repeated experiments shows that it doesnâ€™t matter if people live through one bubble or even two, theyâ€™ll likely fall for bubbles again. The smarter people learn from bubbles. But they donâ€™t learn to avoid them; they participate again and simply think theyâ€™re smart enough to know when to get out. This has been showed many times in trading experiments conducted by Vernon Smith, a professor at George Mason University who shared in the 2002 Nobel Prize in Economics. As Smith said, â€œThe subjects are very optimistic that theyâ€™ll be able to smell the turning point. They always report that theyâ€™re surprised by how quickly it turns and how hard it is to get out at anything like a favorable price.â€ Anatomy of Bubbles and Crashes There is no standard definition of a bubble, but all bubbles look alike because they all go through similar phases. The bible on bubbles isÂ Manias, Panics and Crashes, by Charles Kindleberger. In the book, Kindleberger outlined the five phases of a bubble. He borrowed heavily from the work of the great economist Hyman Minsky. If you look at Figures 9.7 and 9.8 (below), you can see the classic bubble pattern. (As an aside, all you need to know about the Nobel Prize in Economics is that Minsky, Kindleberger, and Schumpeter did not get one and that Paul Krugman did.) Stage 1: Displacement All bubbles start with some basis in reality. Often, it is a new disruptive technology that gets everyone excited, although Kindleberger says it doesnâ€™t need to involve technological progress. It could come through a fundamental change in an economy; for example, the opening up of Russia in the 1990s led to the 1998 bubble or in the 2000s interest rates were low and mortgage lenders were able to fund themselves cheaply. In this displacement phase, smart investors notice the changes that are happening and start investing in the industry or country. Stage 2: Boom Once a bubble starts, a convincing narrative gains traction and the narrative becomes self-reinforcing. As George Soros observed, fundamental analysis seeks to establish how underlying values are reflected in stock prices, whereas the theory of reflexivity shows how stock prices can influence underlying values. For example, in the 1920s people believed that technology like refrigerators, cars, planes, and the radio would change the world (and they did!). In the 1990s, it was the Internet. One of the keys to any bubble is usually loose credit and lending. To finance all the new consumer goods, in the 1920s installment lending was widely adopted, allowing people to buy more than they would have previously. In the 1990s, Internet companies resorted to vendor financing with cheap money that financial markets were throwing at Internet companies. In the housing boom in the 2000s, rising house prices and looser credit allowed more and more people access to credit. And a new financial innovation called securitization developed in the 1990s as a good way to allocate risk and share good returns was perversely twisted into making subprime mortgages acceptable as safe AAA investments. Stage 3: Euphoria In the euphoria phase, everyone becomes aware that they can make money by buying stocks in a certain industry or buying houses in certain places. The early investors have made a lot of money, and, in the words of Kindleberger, â€œthere is nothing so disturbing to oneâ€™s well-being and judgment as to see a friend get rich.â€ Even people who had been on the sidelines start speculating. Shoeshine boys in the 1920s were buying stocks. In the 1990s, doctors and lawyers were day-trading Internet stocks between appointments. In the subprime boom, dozens of channels had programs about people who became house flippers. At the height of the tech bubble, Internet stocks changed hands three times as frequently as other shares. The euphoria phase of a bubble tends to be steep but so brief that it gives investors almost no chance get out of their positions. As prices rise exponentially, the lopsided speculation leads to a frantic effort of speculators to all sell at the same time. We know of one hedge fund in 1999 that had made fortunes for its clients investing in legitimate tech stocks. They decided it was a bubble and elected to close down the fund and return the money in the latter part of 1999. It took a year of concerted effort to close all their positions out. While their investors had fabulous returns, this just illustrates that exiting a bubble can be hard even for professionals. And in illiquid markets? Forget about it. Stage 4: Crisis In the crisis phase, the insiders originally involved start to sell. For example, loads of dot-com insiders dumped their stocks while retail investors piled into companies that went bust. In the subprime bubble, CEOs of homebuilding companies, executives of mortgage lenders like Angelo Mozillo, and CEOs of Lehman Brothers like Dick Fuld dumped hundreds of millions of dollars of stock. The selling starts to gain momentum, as speculators realize that they need to sell, too. However, once prices start to fall, the stocks or house prices start to crash. The only way to sell is to offer prices at a much lower level. The bubble bursts, and euphoric buying is replaced by panic selling. The panic selling in a bubble is like theÂ RoadrunnerÂ cartoons. The coyote runs over a cliff, keeps running, and suddenly finds that there is nothing under his feet. Crashes are always a reflection of illiquidity in two-sided tradingâ€”the inability of sellers to find eager buyers at nearby prices. Stage 5: Revulsion Just as prices became wildly out of line during the early stages of a bubble, in the final stage of revulsion, prices overshoot their fundamental values. Where the press used to write only positive stories about the bubble, suddenly journalists uncover fraud, embezzlement, and abuse. Investors who have lost money look for scapegoats and blame others rather than themselves for participating in bubbles. (Who didnâ€™t speculate with Internet stocks or houses?) As investors stay away from the bubble, prices can fall to irrationally low levels.   A Few Good Central Bankers Space suggests we need to cut it off there, but as I promised at the beginning of the letter, here is a link to a short clip of Jack Nicholson as he might play a central banker on the witness stand when asked about his Code Red monetary policies. You can follow along with the testimony in the transcript below.  You want the truth?Â You can't handle the truth!Â Son, we live in a world that has unfathomably intricate economies, and those economies and the banks that are at their center have to be guarded by men with complex models and printing presses. Who's gonna do it? You? You, Lieutenant Mauldin? Can you even begin to grasp the resources we have to use in order to maintain balance in a system on the brink? I have a greater responsibility than you can possibly fathom! You weep for Savers and creditors, and you curse the central bankers and quantitative easing. You have that luxury. You have the luxury of not knowing what I know: that the destruction of savers with inflation and low rates, while tragic, probably saved lives. And my existence, while grotesque and incomprehensible to you, saves jobs and banks and businesses and whole economies! You don't want the truth, because deep down in places you don't talk about at parties, you want me on that central bank! You need me on that Committee! Without our willingness to silently serve, deflation would come storming over our economic walls and wreak far worse havoc on an entire nation and the world. I will not let the 1930s and that devastating unemployment and loss of lives repeat themselves on my watch. We use words like "full employment," "inflation," "stability." We use these words as the backbone of a life spent defending something. You use them as a punchline! I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps under the blanket of the very prosperity that I provide, and then questions the manner in which I provide it! I would rather you just say "Thank you," and go on your way. Yes, a blatant plug for the book, but a fun one. I invite you toÂ visit theÂ Code RedÂ websiteÂ to get the book. Cleveland, New York, Geneva, and Saudi Arabia I fly to ClevelandÂ tomorrowÂ for my annual checkup with my doctor, Mike Roizen, who tempted me to go ahead and get it over with by offering a seat at a small dinner with Frankie Valli (of Four Seasons and Jersey Boys fame, for you young kids). I grew up singing and would dream of being able to float into the vocal stratosphere as easily as Frankie did. (I actually did sing as a first tenor with the Fort Worth Opera chorus, and was on stage with both Beverly Sills and some new guy called Placido Domingo.) Listening to those '50s oldies still gives me a thrill and stirs up wonderful memories; but truth be told, I could never hit the high C, let alone the regions that Frankie could so effortlessly explore. But we all have our dreams. Post-Thanksgiving I'll make a quick trip to New York (more on that later), and then I'm home for three whole weeks before another longer NYC trip and then Geneva in mid-December and Saudi Arabia at the beginning of the year. And there will be a day in Seattle wedged in there, with my partners at Altegris. I have to admit to getting seriously overwhelmed. That is a different feeling from being stressed. My life is just too much fun these days for me to use the wordÂ stress.Â But perhaps a tad behind in my workload? The reading pile just keeps getting bigger, with ever more â€œmust-readâ€ items hitting the inbox. And the inbox has somehow exploded of late to 300 emails, which I must do something with. (If I owe you a response, I apologize. I will get my house in order.) And there are business meetings and the really important things, like friends and kids and grandkids and the gym. The older I get the more I realize I have to hit the gym if I am going to keep going. I have started something that I am told is yoga, although it seems more like remedial stretching as practiced by Torquemada, masquerading as an otherwise pleasant lady named Kay Harris, whose body bends in a totally incomprehensible fashion, which I am assured is normal for people who take care of themselves. I am completely comfortable with pumping iron, and I enjoy it. I did 150 pushups in my workout this morning. But holding completely still in some silly posture for 30 seconds can be excruciatingly painful. It is one thing to be in a class and pretend and another thing altogether to have someone pushing you into proper form. Yoga is not for sissies. It is time to hit the send button. Shadow Wong in Hong Kong is asking me for something she can start translating for theÂ Hong Kong Economic Journal. I hope you had time to go out with the kids or grandkids on Halloween. Granddaughter Lively, almost 5, went to a door and brought back a piece of candy and said, â€œHere, Papa John! You can have this!â€ It was a bite-sized Snickers, my favorite. I deemed that a sign from the Halloween gods and ate it. I hope you got your favorite as well.
