Yahoo Finance It was an up day for the market and most technology stocks, but not for Apple. Apple stock fell another 2.5% to close at $430--its lowest closing price since the stock's slide began last September. Apple is now down almost 40% from its peak. And for the first time in forever, anyone who has bought Apple in the past year and held it has lost money on it. What's going on with Apple's stock?¬† How low could it go? On the first question, there are several things going on with Apple's stock. Some are fundamental, having to do with changes in Apple's business. ApplePretty. But expensive.Others are related to sentiment and changes in Apple's shareholder base ("Momentum" and "growth" investors are dumping the stock, on the theory that Apple's growth days are over. And as they dump it, the only folks willing to buy it are "value" investors who care deeply about price). One of the things that is not happening with Apple's stock anymore, which many people thought was a big reason for Apple's collapse at the end of last year, is tax-related selling. Tax rates have already gone up. So anyone selling Apple now is selling it for reasons other than trying to lock in a low capital gains rate. Here are some of the issues with Apple's stock: All of these factors are likely weighing on Apple's stock. But here's the good news: The stock is now cheap. Apple is now trading at 10X trailing earnings per share. That's not screamingly cheap. Apple could certainly get "cheaper," especially if its earnings continue to decline. In the old days (mid-1990s and earlier), hardware stocks used to trade between 8X-12X earnings, and Dell, HP, and other companies are actually trading at even lower multiples than that now. (Dell is going private at about 8X earnings. HP is trading at 5X next year's estimated EPS). But unlike HP, Dell, et al, Apple is still a healthy company, so if Apple ever gets to 8X earnings, it will be screamingly cheap. At 10X earnings, Apple is just cheap--cheaper, for example, than the stock market as a whole. And Apple also has $137 billion of cash. Factor out that cash, and the value of the business itself is actually getting close to the Dell level. What will Apple's stock do from here? No one knows, so don't get fooled into thinking that there's some guru out there who can tell you definitively. Apple may release some exciting new products later this year that will get investors buzzing and cause them to pay, say, 14X for Apple's earnings instead of 10X. And that will produce a nice jump in the stock. Or Apple may be in the early innings of a long secular decline in which it eventually becomes the equivalent of Dell (or, worse, Nokia. Or Digital Equipment Corporation.) That depressing future is entirely possible, so don't delude yourself into thinking that it isn't. One thing we can say, though, is that, at 10X earnings, Apple looks cheap and is still in robust financial health. That means that even modest unexpected good news may drive the stock significantly higher. (I don't buy individual stocks these days, but if Apple were to double its dividend to a 4%+ yield, I might find that irresistible. Even if Apple is in the midst of a secular decline, it will likely be able to keep paying those dividends for a good long time.)

Back in September 2011, Warren Buffett announced that Berkshire Hathaway would be buying back shares of the company. At the time, some people went after Buffett for not offering a cash dividend. Today, Buffett offered a comprehensive discussion of his philosophy on dividends in his annual letter to Berkshire's shareholders. He first notes that a company can can do four things with its profits: Every company is always looking into organic growth projects.† And based on his recent deal to take over Heinz, we know that he's still looking at acquisition targets.† And we already noted that Berkshire has a share buyback plan. So, that leaves dividends. With dividends, Buffett notes there are two disadvantages: 1) different investors may desire different levels of payouts, and 2) a dividend received is taxed as income, which long-term investors may not want. Furthermore, introducing a dividend may turn off investors who don't want dividends.† "Above all, dividend policy should always be clear, consistent and rational," writes Buffett.† "A capricious policy will confuse owners and drive away would-be investors." For those who want a dividend, Buffett lays out a scenario where a shareholder can effectively generate dividend-type wealth buy selling shares. (This is an idea that was introduced by Franco Modigliani and Merton Miller.) Ultimately, the message is that Buffett has know plans to pay a dividend. This is not to say he's against companies that pay dividends.† In fact, some of his largest positions are in companies that have been paying growing dividends for years. "At Berkshire, however, we have consistently followed a different approach that we know has been sensible," he writes. Here's his entire discussion about dividends from his annual letter. We applaud him for explaining a very complicated subject in very plain language. DividendsA number of Berkshire shareholders ñ including some of my good friends ñ would like Berkshire to pay a cash dividend. It puzzles them that we relish the dividends we receive from most of the stocks that Berkshire owns, but pay out nothing ourselves. So letís examine when dividends do and donít make sense for shareholders. A profitable company can allocate its earnings in various ways (which are not mutually exclusive). A companyís management should first examine reinvestment possibilities offered by its current business ñ projects to become more efficient, expand territorially, extend and improve product lines or to otherwise widen the economic moat separating the company from its competitors. I ask the managers of our subsidiaries to unendingly focus on moat-widening opportunities, and they find many that make economic sense. But sometimes our managers misfire. The usual cause of failure is that they start with the answer they want and then work backwards to find a supporting rationale. Of course, the process is subconscious; thatís what makes it so dangerous. Your chairman has not been free of this sin. In Berkshireís 1986 annual report, I described how twenty years of management effort and capital improvements in our original textile business were an exercise in futility. I wanted the business to succeed and wished my way into a series of bad decisions. (I even bought another New England textile company.) But wishing makes dreams come true only in Disney movies; itís poison in business. Despite such past miscues, our first priority with available funds will always be to examine whether they can be intelligently deployed in our various businesses. Our record $12.1 billion of fixed-asset investments and bolt- on acquisitions in 2012 demonstrate that this is a fertile field for capital allocation at Berkshire. And here we have an advantage: Because we operate in so many areas of the economy, we enjoy a range of choices far wider than that open to most corporations. In deciding what to do, we can water the flowers and skip over the weeds. Even after we deploy hefty amounts of capital in our current operations, Berkshire will regularly generate a lot of additional cash. Our next step, therefore, is to search for acquisitions unrelated to our current businesses. Here our test is simple: Do Charlie and I think we can effect a transaction that is likely to leave our shareholders wealthier on a per-share basis than they were prior to the acquisition? I have made plenty of mistakes in acquisitions and will make more. Overall, however, our record is satisfactory, which means that our shareholders are far wealthier today than they would be if the funds we used for acquisitions had instead been devoted to share repurchases or dividends. But, to use the standard disclaimer, past performance is no guarantee of future results. Thatís particularly true at Berkshire: Because of our present size, making acquisitions that are both meaningful and sensible is now more difficult than it has been during most of our years. Nevertheless, a large deal still offers us possibilities to add materially to per-share intrinsic value. BNSF is a case in point: It is now worth considerably more than our carrying value. Had we instead allocated the funds required for this purchase to dividends or repurchases, you and I would have been worse off. Though large transactions of the BNSF kind will be rare, there are still some whales in the ocean. The third use of funds ñ repurchases ñ is sensible for a company when its shares sell at a meaningful discount to conservatively calculated intrinsic value. Indeed, disciplined repurchases are the surest way to use funds intelligently: Itís hard to go wrong when youíre buying dollar bills for 80¢ or less. We explained our criteria for repurchases in last yearís report and, if the opportunity presents itself, we will buy large quantities of our stock. We originally said we would not pay more than 110% of book value, but that proved unrealistic. Therefore, we increased the limit to 120% in December when a large block became available at about 116% of book value. But never forget: In repurchase decisions, price is all-important. Value is destroyed when purchases are made above intrinsic value. The directors and I believe that continuing shareholders are benefitted in a meaningful way by purchases up to our 120% limit. And that brings us to dividends. Here we have to make a few assumptions and use some math. The numbers will require careful reading, but they are essential to understanding the case for and against dividends. So bear with me. Weíll start by assuming that you and I are the equal owners of a business with $2 million of net worth. The business earns 12% on tangible net worth ñ $240,000 ñ and can reasonably expect to earn the same 12% on reinvested earnings. Furthermore, there are outsiders who always wish to buy into our business at 125% of net worth. Therefore, the value of what we each own is now $1.25 million. You would like to have the two of us shareholders receive one-third of our companyís annual earnings and have two-thirds be reinvested. That plan, you feel, will nicely balance your needs for both current income and capital growth. So you suggest that we pay out $80,000 of current earnings and retain $160,000 to increase the future earnings of the business. In the first year, your dividend would be $40,000, and as earnings grew and the one- third payout was maintained, so too would your dividend. In total, dividends and stock value would increase 8% each year (12% earned on net worth less 4% of net worth paid out).After ten years our company would have a net worth of $4,317,850 (the original $2 million compounded at 8%) and your dividend in the upcoming year would be $86,357. Each of us would have shares worth $2,698,656 (125% of our half of the companyís net worth). And we would live happily ever after ñ with dividends and the value of our stock continuing to grow at 8% annually. There is an alternative approach, however, that would leave us even happier. Under this scenario, we would leave all earnings in the company and each sell 3.2% of our shares annually. Since the shares would be sold at 125% of book value, this approach would produce the same $40,000 of cash initially, a sum that would grow annually. Call this option the ìsell-offî approach. Under this ìsell-offî scenario, the net worth of our company increases to $6,211,696 after ten years ($2 million compounded at 12%). Because we would be selling shares each year, our percentage ownership would have declined, and, after ten years, we would each own 36.12% of the business. Even so, your share of the net worth of the company at that time would be $2,243,540. And, remember, every dollar of net worth attributable to each of us can be sold for $1.25. Therefore, the market value of your remaining shares would be $2,804,425, about 4% greater than the value of your shares if we had followed the dividend approach. Moreover, your annual cash receipts from the sell-off policy would now be running 4% more than you would have received under the dividend scenario. Voila! ñ you would have both more cash to spend annually and more capital value. This calculation, of course, assumes that our hypothetical company can earn an average of 12% annually on net worth and that its shareholders can sell their shares for an average of 125% of book value. To that point, the S&amp;P 500 earns considerably more than 12% on net worth and sells at a price far above 125% of that net worth. Both assumptions also seem reasonable for Berkshire, though certainly not assured. Moreover, on the plus side, there also is a possibility that the assumptions will be exceeded. If they are, the argument for the sell-off policy becomes even stronger. Over Berkshireís history ñ admittedly one that wonít come close to being repeated ñ the sell-off policy would have produced results for shareholders dramatically superior to the dividend policy. Aside from the favorable math, there are two further ñ and important ñ arguments for a sell-off policy. First, dividends impose a specific cash-out policy upon all shareholders. If, say, 40% of earnings is the policy, those who wish 30% or 50% will be thwarted. Our 600,000 shareholders cover the waterfront in their desires for cash. It is safe to say, however, that a great many of them ñ perhaps even most of them ñ are in a net-savings mode and logically should prefer no payment at all. The sell-off alternative, on the other hand, lets each shareholder make his own choice between cash receipts and capital build-up. One shareholder can elect to cash out, say, 60% of annual earnings while other shareholders elect 20% or nothing at all. Of course, a shareholder in our dividend-paying scenario could turn around and use his dividends to purchase more shares. But he would take a beating in doing so: He would both incur taxes and also pay a 25% premium to get his dividend reinvested. (Keep remembering, open-market purchases of the stock take place at 125% of book value.) The second disadvantage of the dividend approach is of equal importance: The tax consequences for all taxpaying shareholders are inferior ñ usually far inferior ñ to those under the sell-off program. Under the dividend program, all of the cash received by shareholders each year is taxed whereas the sell-off program results in tax on only the gain portion of the cash receipts. Let me end this math exercise ñ and I can hear you cheering as I put away the dentist drill ñ by using my own case to illustrate how a shareholderís regular disposals of shares can be accompanied by an increased investment in his or her business. For the last seven years, I have annually given away about 41/4% of my Berkshire shares. Through this process, my original position of 712,497,000 B-equivalent shares (split-adjusted) has decreased to 528,525,623 shares. Clearly my ownership percentage of the company has significantly decreased. Yet my investment in the business has actually increased: The book value of my current interest in Berkshire considerably exceeds the book value attributable to my holdings of seven years ago. (The actual figures are $28.2 billion for 2005 and $40.2 billion for 2012.) In other words, I now have far more money working for me at Berkshire even though my ownership of the company has materially decreased. Itís also true that my share of both Berkshireís intrinsic business value and the companyís normal earning power is far greater than it was in 2005. Over time, I expect this accretion of value to continue ñ albeit in a decidedly irregular fashion ñ even as I now annually give away more than 41/2% of my shares (the increase having occurred because Iíve recently doubled my lifetime pledges to certain foundations). ************ Above all, dividend policy should always be clear, consistent and rational. A capricious policy will confuse owners and drive away would-be investors. Phil Fisher put it wonderfully 54 years ago in Chapter 7 of his Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits, a book that ranks behind only The Intelligent Investor and the 1940 edition of Security Analysis in the all-time-best list for the serious investor. Phil explained that you can successfully run a restaurant that serves hamburgers or, alternatively, one that features Chinese food. But you canít switch capriciously between the two and retain the fans of either. Most companies pay consistent dividends, generally trying to increase them annually and cutting them very reluctantly. Our ìBig Fourî portfolio companies follow this sensible and understandable approach and, in certain cases, also repurchase shares quite aggressively. We applaud their actions and hope they continue on their present paths. We like increased dividends, and we love repurchases at appropriate prices. At Berkshire, however, we have consistently followed a different approach that we know has been sensible and that we hope has been made understandable by the paragraphs you have just read. We will stick with this policy as long as we believe our assumptions about the book-value buildup and the market-price premium seem reasonable. If the prospects for either factor change materially for the worse, we will reexamine our actions.
Laenulfean / FlickrWith optimism resurfacing over the global economy and the perception that major tail risks in the United States, the euro zone, and China have been mostly squared away, what's left to worry about? We posed the question to our favorite analysts, economists, and traders across Wall Street ñ and we were surprised at the number of people who declined to give an answer, telling us that they just couldn't really think of anything too worrying right now. However, we still got plenty of responses. While general developments in the world's largest economies seem encouraging, there may be several reasons to be concerned lurking just beneath the surface. Let's go to the charts.
Oceana, an international organization focused on ocean conservation, recently conducted a study of commercially available seafood, testing pieces of fish to see if they were actually the fish they were being sold as. It tested DNA from fish samples purchased at restaurants, markets, and grocery stories, and† found that one-third (33 percent) of the 1,215 samples analyzed nationwide were mislabeled, according to U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidelines. By those FDA guidelines, some highly related fish species can be sold under the same "market name." This seafood fraud leads consumers to pay a lot more for a lesser quality product, or may lead to health hazards as people who may be allergic to some types of seafood may end up consuming it because of mislabeling. We talked to Dr. Kimberly Warner, a senior scientist at Oceana, over Skype to get more details on the study and its implications:

The Sequester Will Hit Markets Hard, Eventually (Business Insider) Even though markets don't seem to be reacting to the sequester, which kicked in today, they're eventually going to feel the squeeze. Many economists feel that the sequester will be harmful to the economy, and that in turn, will depress markets. This is reminiscent of Japan, which saw several rounds of "premature tightening" and corresponding downturns in the market. Morgan Stanley Medicaid Trusts Are Popular With Older Investors (The Wall Street Journal) Middle-class investors between 50 and 60 are turning to Medicaid trusts to protect their assets, and those of their children, from being used to pay for care. Advisors are recommending that clients get an attorney and then transfer some or all of their assets into a trust, after which the client would meet the guidelines to become eligible for Medicaid. "The trusts have become more popular ‚Äî that's an awful lot of Middle America affected by the high cost of nursing-home care," Robert M. Geurden, a partner at law firm Brier &amp; Geurden, told the WSJ. But starting next year the rule for Medicaid eligibility is set to change, and will be based on income, not assets, for those under 65. Volatility In Foreign Exchange Markets Is An Ominous Indicator (Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale) The last time foreign exchange market volatility spiked from ultra-low levels like it is right now, the financial crisis hit. When Business Insider asked Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale's senior Forex strategist Sebastien Galy what he is really worried about, he showed us this chart: Business Insider It's Not Too Late To Buy Into The Stock Market (Advisor Perspectives) After years of money flowing from equities to bonds, the tide began to turn as mutual fund investors bought back into the stock market, driving prices even higher. The Dow has surpassed its pre-crisis high, and the S&amp;P 500 is trading 125 percent higher than its bottom in 2009. But it's still not too late to buy back into the stock market, according to Alliance Bernstein's Seth Masters. "While the market may temporarily retrace some of its recent gains, we think it still offers good ‚Äî if below-average ‚Äî long-term return potential, with international stocks somewhat more attractively priced than their U.S. counterparts," said Masters. Investment Tech Isn't Good Enough For Most Clients (Financial Planning) When it comes to making investment decisions, the technology used by financial advisors just doesn't measure up for most clients, according to a new report by SEI Advisor Network. ‚ÄúInvestors can find their account balances anywhere,‚Äù Kevin Crowe, SEI's head of solutions told Financial Planning, ‚ÄúWe found they want their advisors‚Äô technology to help identify clients‚Äô goals, create plans, and show what progress is being made towards meeting those goals.‚Äù However, investors are reasonably happy with their financial advisor's use of technology in managing their investments, according to the report.
AP ImagesWarren Buffett's annual shareholder letter is out. In it, he has a huge section on newspapers. In the past 15 months, Berkshire Hathaway acquired 28 daily newspapers for $344 million. With what everyone says about the death of print media, many might wonder why he would take these on. Buffett's rationale sounds a lot like that of my Columbia journalism school professors. They both focus on hyperlocal and community reporting. Buffet says: "Newspapers continue to reign supreme, however, in the delivery of local news. If you want to know what‚Äôs going on in your town ‚Äì whether the news is about the mayor or taxes or high school football ‚Äì there is no substitute for a local newspaper that is doing its job. A reader‚Äôs eyes may glaze over after they take in a couple of paragraphs about Canadian tariffs or political developments in Pakistan; a story about the reader himself or his neighbors will be read to the end. Wherever there is a pervasive sense of community, a paper that serves the special informational needs of that community will remain indispensable to a significant portion of its residents. ...Charlie and I believe that papers delivering comprehensive and reliable information to tightly-bound communities and having a sensible Internet strategy will remain viable for a long time. " He is however pragmatic as ever, and says in no uncertain terms that he "will not continue the operation of any business doomed to unending losses". The entire section on newspapers is included below. ______________________________________ We Buy Some Newspapers . . . Newspapers? During the past fifteen months, we acquired 28 daily newspapers at a cost of $344 million. This may puzzle you for two reasons. First, I have long told you in these letters and at our annual meetings that the circulation, advertising and profits of the newspaper industry overall are certain to decline. That prediction still holds. Second, the properties we purchased fell far short of meeting our off-stated size requirements for acquisitions. We can address the second point easily. Charlie and I love newspapers and, if their economics make sense, will buy them even when they fall far short of the size threshold we would require for the purchase of, say, a widget company. Addressing the first point requires me to provide a more elaborate explanation, including some history News, to put it simply, is what people don‚Äôt know that they want to know. And people will seek their news ‚Äì what‚Äôs important to them ‚Äì from whatever sources provide the best combination of immediacy, ease of access, reliability, comprehensiveness and low cost. The relative importance of these factors varies with the nature of the news and the person wanting it.Before television and the Internet, newspapers were the primary source for an incredible variety of news, a fact that made them indispensable to a very high percentage of the population. Whether your interests were international, national, local, sports or financial quotations, your newspaper usually was first to tell you the latest information. Indeed, your paper contained so much you wanted to learn that you received your money‚Äôs worth, even if only a small number of its pages spoke to your specific interests. Better yet, advertisers typically paid almost all of the product‚Äôs cost, and readers rode their coattails.Additionally, the ads themselves delivered information of vital interest to hordes of readers, in effect providing even more ‚Äúnews.‚Äù Editors would cringe at the thought, but for many readers learning what jobs or apartments were available, what supermarkets were carrying which weekend specials, or what movies were showing where and when was far more important than the views expressed on the editorial page. In turn, the local paper was indispensable to advertisers. If Sears or Safeway built stores in Omaha, they required a ‚Äúmegaphone‚Äù to tell the city‚Äôs residents why their stores should be visited today.Indeed, big department stores and grocers vied to outshout their competition with multi-page spreads, knowing that the goods they¬† advertised would fly off the shelves. With no other megaphone remotely comparable to that of the newspaper, ads sold themselves.As long as a newspaper was the only one in its community, its profits were certain to be extraordinary; whether it was managed well or poorly made little difference. (As one Southern publisher famously confessed, ‚ÄúI owe my exalted position in life to two great American institutions ‚Äì nepotism and monopoly.‚Äù) Over the years, almost all cities became one-newspaper towns (or harbored two competing papers that joined forces to operate as a single economic unit). This contraction was inevitable because most people wished to read and pay for only one paper. When competition existed, the paper that gained a significant lead in circulation almost automatically received the most ads. That left ads drawing readers and readers drawing ads. This symbiotic process spelled doom for the weaker paper and became known as ‚Äúsurvival of the fattest.‚ÄùNow the world has changed. Stock market quotes and the details of national sports events are old news long before the presses begin to roll. The Internet offers extensive information about both available jobs and homes. Television bombards viewers with political, national and international news. In one area of interest after another, newspapers have therefore lost their ‚Äúprimacy.‚Äù And, as their audiences have fallen, so has advertising. (Revenues from ‚Äúhelp wanted‚Äù classified ads ‚Äì long a huge source of income for newspapers ‚Äì have plunged more than 90% in the past 12 years.)Newspapers continue to reign supreme, however, in the delivery of local news. If you want to know what‚Äôs going on in your town ‚Äì whether the news is about the mayor or taxes or high school football ‚Äì there is no substitute for a local newspaper that is doing its job. A reader‚Äôs eyes may glaze over after they take in a couple of paragraphs about Canadian tariffs or political developments in Pakistan; a story about the reader himself or his neighbors will be read to the end. Wherever there is a pervasive sense of community, a paper that serves the special informational needs of that community will remain indispensable to a significant portion of its residents.Even a valuable product, however, can self-destruct from a faulty business strategy. And that process has been underway during the past decade at almost all papers of size. Publishers ‚Äì including Berkshire in Buffalo ‚Äì have offered their paper free on the Internet while charging meaningful sums for the physical specimen. How could this lead to anything other than a sharp and steady drop in sales of the printed product? Falling circulation, moreover, makes a paper less essential to advertisers. Under these conditions, the ‚Äúvirtuous circle‚Äù of the past reverses.The Wall Street Journal went to a pay model early. But the main exemplar for local newspapers is the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette , published by Walter Hussman, Jr. Walter also adopted a pay format early, and over the past decade his paper has retained its circulation far better than any other large paper in the country. Despite Walter‚Äôs powerful example, it‚Äôs only been in the last year or so that other papers, including Berkshire‚Äôs, have explored pay arrangements. Whatever works best ‚Äì and the answer is not yet clear ‚Äì will be copied widely. Charlie and I believe that papers delivering comprehensive and reliable information to tightly-bound communities and having a sensible Internet strategy will remain viable for a long time. We do not believe that success will come from cutting either the news content or frequency of publication. Indeed, skimpy news coverage will almost certainly lead to skimpy readership. And the less-than-daily publication that is now being tried in some large towns or cities ‚Äì while it may improve profits in the short term ‚Äì seems certain to diminish the papers‚Äôrelevance over time. Our goal is to keep our papers loaded with content of interest to our readers and to be paid appropriately by those who find us useful, whether the product they view is in their hands or on the Internet.Our confidence is buttressed by the availability of Terry Kroeger‚Äôs outstanding management group at the Omaha World-Herald, a team that has the ability to oversee a large group of papers. The individual papers, however, will be independent in their news coverage and editorial opinions. (I voted for Obama; of our 12 dailies that endorsed a presidential candidate, 10 opted for Romney.)Our newspapers are certainly not insulated from the forces that have been driving revenues downward. Still, the six small dailies we owned throughout 2012 had unchanged revenues for the year, a result far superior to that experienced by big-city dailies. Moreover, the two large papers we operated throughout the year ‚Äì The Buffalo News and the Omaha World-Herald ‚Äì held their revenue loss to 3%, which was also an above-average outcome.Among newspapers in America‚Äôs 50 largest metropolitan areas, our Buffalo and Omaha papers rank near the top in circulation penetration of their home territories. This popularity is no accident: Credit the editors of those papers ‚Äì Margaret Sullivan at the Newsand Mike Reilly at the World-Herald ‚Äî for delivering information that has made their publications indispensable to community-interested readers. (Margaret, I regret to say, recently left us to join The New York Times, whose job offers are tough to turn down. That paper made a great hire, and we wish her the best.)Berkshire‚Äôs cash earnings from its papers will almost certainly trend downward over time. Even a sensible Internet strategy will not be able to prevent modest erosion. At our cost, however, I believe these papers will meet or exceed our economic test for acquisitions. Results to date support that belief. Charlie and I, however, still operate under economic principle 11 (detailed on page 99) and will not continue the operation of any business doomed to unending losses. One daily paper that we acquired in a bulk purchase from Media General was significantly unprofitable under that company‚Äôs ownership. After analyzing the paper‚Äôs results, we saw no remedy for the losses and reluctantly shut it down. All of our remaining dailies, however, should be profitable for a long time to come. (They are listed on page 108.) At appropriate prices ‚Äì and that means at a very low multiple of current earnings ‚Äì we will purchase more papers of the type we like. A milestone in Berkshire‚Äôs newspaper operations occurred at yearend when Stan Lipsey retired as publisher of The Buffalo News. It‚Äôs no exaggeration for me to say that the News might now be extinct were it not for Stan. Charlie and I acquired the News in April 1977. It was an evening paper, dominant on weekdays but lacking a Sunday edition. Throughout the country, the circulation trend was toward morning papers. Moreover, Sunday was becoming ever more critical to the profitability of metropolitan dailies. Without a Sunday paper, the News was destined to lose out to its morning competitor, which had a fat and entrenched Sunday product.We therefore began to print a Sunday edition late in 1977. And then all hell broke loose. Our competitor sued us, and District Judge Charles Brieant, Jr. authored a harsh ruling that crippled the introduction of our paper. His ruling was later reversed ‚Äì after 17 long months ‚Äì in a 3-0 sharp rebuke by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. While the appeal was pending, we lost circulation, hemorrhaged money and stood in constant danger of going out of business.Enter Stan Lipsey, a friend of mine from the 1960s, who, with his wife, had sold Berkshire a small Omaha weekly. I found Stan to be an extraordinary newspaperman, knowledgeable about every aspect of circulation, production, sales and editorial. (He was a key person in gaining that small weekly a Pulitzer Prize in 1973.) So when I was in big trouble at the News, I asked Stan to leave his comfortable way of life in Omaha to take over in Buffalo.He never hesitated. Along with Murray Light, our editor, Stan persevered through four years of very dark days until the News won the competitive struggle in 1982. Ever since, despite a difficult Buffalo economy, the performance of the News has been exceptional. As both a friend and as a manager, Stan is simply the best.

ShutterstockHere's a great segment from Warren Buffett's new shareholder letter, slamming CEOs who don't engage in business or investment because of "uncertainty." The kicker line at the end is this one: "If you are a CEO who has some large, profitable project you are shelving because of short-term worries, call Berkshire. Let us unburden you." ------------------------- There was a lot of hand-wringing last year among CEOs who cried ìuncertaintyî when faced with capital- allocation decisions (despite many of their businesses having enjoyed record levels of both earnings and cash). At Berkshire, we didnít share their fears, instead spending a record $9.8 billion on plant and equipment in 2012, about 88% of it in the United States. Thatís 19% more than we spent in 2011, our previous high. Charlie and I love investing large sums in worthwhile projects, whatever the pundits are saying. We instead heed the words from Gary Allanís new country song, ìEvery Storm Runs Out of Rain.îWe will keep our foot to the floor and will almost certainly set still another record for capital expenditures in 2013. Opportunities abound in America.A thought for my fellow CEOs: Of course, the immediate future is uncertain; America has faced theunknown since 1776. Itís just that sometimes people focus on the myriad of uncertainties that always exist while at other times they ignore them (usually because the recent past has been uneventful).American business will do fine over time. And stocks will do well just as certainly, since their fate is tied to business performance. Periodic setbacks will occur, yes, but investors and managers are in a game that is heavily stacked in their favor. (The Dow Jones Industrials advanced from 66 to 11,497 in the 20th Century, a staggering 17,320% increase that materialized despite four costly wars, a Great Depression and many recessions. And donít forget that shareholders received substantial dividends throughout the century as well.)Since the basic game is so favorable, Charlie and I believe itís a terrible mistake to try to dance in and out of it based upon the turn of tarot cards, the predictions of ìexperts,î or the ebb and flow of business activity. The risks of being out of the game are huge compared to the risks of being in it. My own history provides a dramatic example: I made my first stock purchase in the spring of 1942 when the U.S. was suffering major losses throughout the Pacific war zone. Each dayís headlines told of more setbacks. Even so, there was no talk about uncertainty; every American I knew believed we would prevail. The countryís success since that perilous time boggles the mind: On an inflation-adjusted basis, GDP per capita more than quadrupled between 1941 and 2012. Throughout that period, every tomorrow has been uncertain. Americaís destiny, however, has always been clear: ever-increasing abundance. If you are a CEO who has some large, profitable project you are shelving because of short-term worries, call Berkshire. Let us unburden you.

I love a contrarian argument, and once upon a time I enjoyed Wall Street bonuses, so you can imagine my delight to receive in my inbox a link to a video from MinuteMBA[1] titled ‚ÄúIn Defense of the Wall Street Bonus‚Äù yesterday.  The video is also a great example of the difference between being smart and being wise.¬† That difference comes down to ‚ÄúCan you ask the right questions?‚Äù The folks behind ‚ÄúIn Defense of the Wall Street Bonus,‚Äù ask the wrong questions. The video sets out to answer the following wrong questions: 1. Are bonuses an appropriate mechanism for compensating Wall Street bankers, when compared to salaries?  They give the correct answer, which is ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù¬† Flexible compensation in the form of bonuses is the key to mitigating volatile profits streams inherent to Wall Street firms, as currently constituted. 2. Are there potential negative consequences to the economy to the regulation of Wall Street bonuses? Again, they get the correct answer, which is ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù ¬†More regulation = less employment, which leads to negative knock-on effects for finance-dependent economies like New York. 3. Are banker bonuses fair? The narrator in the video makes a passing reference to the idea that Wall Street folks ‚Äúmight be overpaid,‚Äù and I share his ambivalent feeling about this.[2] So far, so good, as these questions go. Unfortunately, in the light of the 2008 bailouts of Wall Street firms, none of these three questions are the most important questions to ask about Wall Street bonuses. A better series of questions with respect to Wall Street bonuses would go something like this: 1. Are Too-Big-To-Fail Banks actually private entities at all? 2. Are they instead systemically important and heavily subsidized corporations entrusted with the public welfare ‚Äì akin to electric utilities, or Amtrak? 3. If they are heavily subsidized and systemically important, doesn‚Äôt it make sense that they would be heavily regulated to within an inch of their lives? 4. Just as we would expect with a public utility entrusted with the public welfare, doesn‚Äôt it make sense to limit the compensation of employees and executives, until such time as they make themselves systemically irrelevant? I actually think that the Too-Big-To-Fail banks do serve a systemically important function.¬† We do need them, and their sudden and messy disappearance would prompt a swift financial and societal crisis. As a natural result of their importance, we taxpayers have a nearly unlimited liability[3] with respect to exposure to these systemically important institutions. I‚Äôve got no problem with taxpayer funds backstopping systemically important institutions at critical times, just like we pay for national defense, the FDA, the CDC, and NASA.¬† Our big banks are important too. What really has me snapping pencils[4] however, is to see Too-Big-To-Fail banks with a government guaranteed safety net paying bonuses to its employees, as if they are being run as private entities. Guess what? As long as you know the government‚Äôs got your back, you‚Äôre not really private. If you‚Äôre Too-Big-To-Fail, you‚Äôre Amtrak in my book.[5]¬† None of you should get more than a few hundred thousand annually.¬† And that‚Äôs being generous. Now, before you accuse me of being a Communist, or a Wall Street hater, let me clarify. I love private enterprise. I applaud successful hedge fund managers, for example, and I do not begrudge their extraordinary compensation, provided they follow the rules[6] and manage capital for willing investors. One of the keys to my applause, however, is my belief that any of those hedge funds could disappear tomorrow, as a result of a bad bet, misplaced customer funds, or a faulty computer algorithm, and no government entity will step up to save their bacon. I long for the day when the employees of Wall Street banks can reap legitimate profits, if they deserve it, or similarly disappear without a whimper, if they deserve it. If the Too-Big-To-Fail banks managed to break themselves into systemically irrelevant parts, I would have no problem with their executives paying themselves massive bonuses in good years.¬† They‚Äôd have earned it. But until that day, when they‚Äôre finally Too-Small-For-Bailouts, please don‚Äôt pretend that they‚Äôre anything more than a big NASA ‚Äì a bunch of smart people in a big room full of flat screens, filling an important government-subsidized mission ‚Äì working on the taxpayer‚Äôs dime. [1] I‚Äôd never heard of them either, but the site looks intriguing. [2] When I worked on Wall Street I certainly never felt overpaid.¬† In fact I felt underpaid and pissed off about it most of the time.¬† Just like everybody else.¬† Alas, with the passage of time and some distance between Wall Street and me, it becomes easier to say, ‚ÄúYeah, all those guys over there are overpaid.‚Äù¬† So, yes, self-serving delusions are universal and an inescapable feature of the human condition. [3] Ok, technically not unlimited.¬† Neil Barofksy, aka SIGTARP, the Norse God of Financial Accountability, placed the public liability at the height of the bailout at $23.7 Trillion. [4] Picture me scribbling these next few sentences long-hand with a stubby pencil bearing down too hard on a dirty notebook at some fluorescent-lit diner smelling like last month‚Äôs ham and swiss, and you‚Äôll get a sense for how mad I get about this.¬† Pretty much starkers. [5] By the way, Jamie Dimon?¬† You‚Äôre announcement this week that ‚ÄúYou need us Big Banks‚Äù is another reminder that self-serving delusions are universal and an inescapable feature of the human condition. [6] Which, of course, I have my doubts they all do, but that‚Äôs a longer story.
AP ImagesNote: We originally reported the State department was making its final recommendation to the President. The documents published were instead a draft Environmental Impact Statement. ¬† Thee department says¬†the¬†Keystone Pipeline would not have much impact on Canadian oil sands development¬†and poses little threat to local environment concerns. "It is unlikely that the proposed Project construction would have a substantial impact on the rate of WCSB [Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin] oil sands development," the report says. It says not building it would curb carbon emissions by¬†"0.07m to 0.83m" tons per year. That's less than the amount a single coal factory pumps into the air each year. The document goes into granular detail about localized environmental impact, but finds the likelihood of damage from something going wrong as low. "Since the majority of oil spills are small in volume...smaller spills, if reaching larger lakes, would result in minimal effects on overall water quality, assuming the lake volume is substantially larger than the volume of spilled oil." The report says the pipeline will impact "relatively low numbers of wetland acres."¬† Construction on the American section of the pipeline is already completed or underway. The structure will transport 700,000 of crude daily from Alberta to the Gulf of Mexico. This week, the New York Times' Steven Greenhouse¬†reported that AFL-CIO actually came out in favor of the project, if indirectly: Pipelines, the labor leaders said, ‚Äúare a low carbon emissions method of transporting oil and gas‚Äù and ‚Äúlower the cost of fuel they carry compared with other forms of transportation.‚Äù Click here for updates &gt;
The Daily Pennsylvanian reported this week that Nadirah Farah Foley, a former admissions officer, had left the school after making fun of applicants on her Facebook account (h/t IvyGate). Chalk this up as yet another reason not to be too open on Facebook ‚Äî as if there weren't enough. Foley, a Princeton alum, was responsible for coordinating admissions in Connecticut. Her Facebook posts were discovered when an anonymous source sent screenshots of her updates to Penn's Dean of Admissions and The Daily Pennsylvanian. Here's some of what Foley was making fun of (from the Daily Pennsylvanian): In one essay, a student had written about his ‚Äúlong and deep‚Äù connections to the University, citing the fact that he had been circumcised at Penn Hillel years ago. ‚ÄúI look forward to engaging in the academic, social and Orthodox Jewish communities on campus,‚Äù the student wrote, according to Foley‚Äôs post. ‚ÄúStop the madness,‚Äù Foley said in response to the essay on Facebook. In another excerpt, she quoted an essay in which an applicant had described the experience of overcoming his fear of using the bathroom outdoors while camping in the wilderness. ‚ÄúAnother gem,‚Äù Foley wrote of the student‚Äôs topic choice.

Wikimedia CommonsCharles PonziThe financially literate are more likely to get scammed by financial fraudsters than are members of the general public, according to the findings of a study conducted by the FINRA Foundation and the AARP. Morningstar's Adam Zoll interviewed Doug Shadel,¬†director of AARP Washington and author of the book,¬†Outsmarting the Scam Artists. "They (the victims) tend to have higher levels of income, more assets, all the things that seem counterintuitive to the victim population," said Shadel in the interview. Here are the top tactics that financial con men use to reel in their victims, according to Shadel: 1. One trick financial fraudsters use is to offer victims exactly what they want. If an offer seems too good to be true, it probably is. 2. All good cons have an element of truth to them. "One [instance of financial fraud] that comes to my mind is oil and gas. 'You can get a 10-to-1 return. We're doing more domestic production than ever.' All of which is true. The best scam always has an element of truth to it." 3. They claim that everyone, including, Buffet is doing it.¬†The goal is to make their operation seem legitimate, and it works. 4. They'll ask you to check their FINRA registration (in hopes that you won't).¬†Just making the claim of legitimacy is usually enough, as victims typically don't check. Watch the full interview:

Theo Wargo / Getty ImagesSorry, but you'll never be able to replicate the investment strategy that has made Warren Buffett a billionaire. To be clear, we're not suggesting that the principles of long-term, value investing are worthless. But a recent study concludes that Buffett's win-streak is about much more than savvy stock-picking. According to AQR Capital Management's Andrea Frazzini and David Kabiller and NYU's Lasse Pedersen, Buffett's returns are driven by a combination of investing in low-beta stocks and employing low-cost leverage. In other words, he bets on stocks with low, yet stable returns, and he amplifies those returns by betting with cheap borrowed money. That second part is key because not everyone has access to the type of cheap financing one can get when one is a billionaire backed by a multi-billion dollar corporation betting on hundreds of millions of dollars worth of stocks. "We estimate that Berkshire‚Äôs average leverage is about 1.6-to-1 and that it relies on unusually low-cost and stable sources of financing," write the authors in their paper, "Buffett's Alpha." They identify four reasons why Buffett's leverage costs are so low (emphasis ours): In addition to considering the magnitude of Buffett‚Äôs leverage, it is also interesting to consider his sources of leverage including their terms and costs. Berkshire‚Äôs debt has benefitted from being highly rated, enjoying a AAA rating from 1989 to 2009. As an illustration of the low financing rates enjoyed by Buffett, Berkshire issued the first ever negative-coupon security in 2002, a senior note with a warrant. Berkshire‚Äôs more anomalous cost of leverage, however, is due to its insurance float. Collecting insurance premiums up front and later paying a diversified set of claims is like taking a ‚Äúloan.‚Äù Table 3 shows that the estimated average annual cost of Berkshire‚Äôs insurance float is only 2.2%, more than 3 percentage points below the average T-bill rate. Hence, Buffett‚Äôs low-cost insurance and reinsurance businesses have given him a significant advantage in terms of unique access to cheap, term leverage. We estimate that 36% of Berkshire‚Äôs liabilities consist of insurance float on average. Based on the balance sheet data, Berkshire also appears to finance part of its capital expenditure using tax deductions for accelerated depreciation of property, plant and equipment as provided for under the IRS rules. E.g., Berkshire reports $28 Billion of such deferred tax liabilities in 2011 (page 49 of the Annual Report). Accelerating depreciation is similar to an interest-free loan in the sense that (i) Berkshire enjoys a tax saving earlier than it otherwise would have, and (ii) the dollar amount of the tax when it is paid in the future is the same as the earlier savings (i.e. the tax liability does not accrue interest or compound). Berkshire‚Äôs remaining liabilities include accounts payable and derivative contract liabilities. Indeed, Berkshire has sold a number of derivative contracts, including writing index option contracts on several major equity indices, notably put options, and credit default obligations (see, e.g., the 2011 Annual Report)...Hence, Berkshire‚Äôs sale of derivatives may both serve as a source of financing and as a source of revenue as such derivatives tend to be expensive (Frazzini and Pedersen (2012)). Frazzini and Pedersen (2012) show that investors that are either unable or unwilling to use leverage will pay a premium for instruments that embed the leverage, such as option contracts and levered ETFs. Hence, Buffett can profit by supplying this embedded leverage as he has a unique access to stable and cheap financing. This is not intended to discredit Buffett's accomplishments.¬† Indeed, this is an extremely sophisticated and smart strategy. But the bottom line is that the average investor cannot replicate Buffett's strategy. Download the paper at Yale.edu. SEE ALSO: The scariest charts in the world &gt;
Flickr/Ctwirler12Why do we have such an aversion to horse meat? The discovery of traces of horse meat in food products supposedly made of beef or pork has caused a scandal in Britain and, most recently, prompted Ikea to withdraw its Swedish meatballs from stores in 21 European countries. The controversy is obviously about more than the mislabeling of food. The very idea of eating horse strikes many people in Britain and the U.S. as abhorrent ó despite the fact that horse is considered a proper food item in many parts of the world. A new study from researchers at Oxford University says the roots of the taboo on horse meat are in the spread of Christianity in Anglo-Saxon England. But the real reason may be something more pedestrian: simple economics. Although church authorities did attempt to root out the practice of eating horse in Northern Europe and the U.K. because of its perceived connection with paganism, there's no evidence that this was the decisive factor in turning popular sentiment against horse meat. It seems far more likely that the aversion grew out of common sense home economics. Cows are just more efficient sources of food than horses. Brian Palmer of Slate explains that in terms of caloric content, 3 ounces of cows give you more bang per pound: A three-ounce serving of roast horse has 149 calories, 24 grams of protein, and five grams of fat. The same amount of beef tenderloin has 179 calories, 24 grams of protein, and nine grams of fat. Horse milk, which some Central Asians drink in fermented form, has one-third the fat of cow's milk. To the contemporary eye, that may make it sound as if horse meat is healthier than beef. But that's only because we have ample sources of calories and fat available to us. For most of human history, that hasn't been true. Medieval residents of Northern Europe would have certainly appreciated the higher calorie, higher fat content of beef. Even without the scientific ways of discovering precise fat and caloric intakes, it would have been easy to notice that a serving of beef left you feeling more full than a serving of horse. What's more, the different digestive systems of horses and cows mean that cows are more efficient eaters. A 2002 study published in the Journal of Applied Ecology found that horses eat 63 percent more than cattle. This isn't just a matter of bulk. Horses also eat more "digestible material" with actual nutritional content than cows, according to the study. This is rooted in the differences between the digestive systems of the animals. Here's how Jessica Walling, a graduate student at Central Washington University, explains it at the Mustang Management blog: [Cows and horses] diverged from common ancestors into two families known as Artiodactyla and Perissodactyla ñ ruminant and cecal digesters. Fermentation in the cecum and the rumen is similar. However, horses are only 70% as efficient as cows at digestion. This is because cattle regurgitate and chew partially digested food as "cud," repeatedly. Food is ground into smaller particle sizes. Another reason cattle are more efficient is because the food they intake is digested by microbes before it enters the true stomach. Given a choice between raising cows and horses for food, it makes far more sense to raise cows. To put it differently, people who preferred beef to horse meat would have been healthier, heartier and used available resources more efficiently. They would, in short, have been more prosperous and successful. Over time, the beef eaters would triumph over the horse eaters. While early Christian leadership may have nudged some in Europe away from eating horse meat, it's very likely the more efficient culinary taste would have won out even without a papal edict.
YouTubeAny time Senator Elizabeth Warren speaks, Wall Streeters pay rapt attention to see, waiting for clues as to what kind of action she'll take to rein in the financial services industry. The problem with that is it may have created a bit of tunnel vision. While Warren certainly has been outspoken in Senate Banking Committee hearings, other Senators have been taking action. Yesterday, Senators Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and David Vitter (R-LA) both gave presentations on the floor of the Senate about ending "too big to fail." Here's part of what Brown said (you can read the full text on his website): Wall Street has been allowed to run wild for years. We simply cannot wait any longer for regulators to act. These institutions are too big to manage, they are too big to regulate, and they are surely still too big to fail. We cannot rely on the financial market to fix itself because the rules of competitive markets and creative destruction do not apply to the Wall Street megabanks. Megabanksí shareholders and creditors have no incentive to end ìtoo big to failî ñ they get paid out when banks are bailed out. Taking the appropriate steps will lead to more mid-sized banks ñ not a few megabanks ñ creating competition, increasing lending, and providing incentives for banks to lend the right way. Cam Fine, the head of the Independent Community Bankers of America, is calling for the largest banks to be downsized because he sees that his members are at a disadvantage. Just about the only people who will not benefit from reining in these megabanks are a few Wall Street executives. Congress needs to take action now to prevent future economic collapse and future taxpayer-funded bailouts. I want to thank my colleague, Senator Vitter, who recognizes this problem and is joining me in doing something about it. I am pleased to announce today that we are working on bipartisan legislation to address this ìToo Big to Failî problem. It will incorporate ideas put forward by Tom Hoenig, Richard Fisher, and Sheila Bair. Yep, legislation inspired by the writing of former FDIC Chairwoman, Sheila Bair. She's made no secret of her desire to see banks more regulated. Politicians have been talking about ending too big to fail a lot more recently too. Ben Bernanke was grilled about it during testimony in the Senate and the House this week. Another important thing to note about Brown that makes his speech that much more important, is that in 2010 he sponsored the SAFE Banking Act. The law was defeated by a vote of 33-61, but its passage would've been crushing for Wall Street. The law put a 10% cap any bank's liabilities, leverage, and share of deposits in the United States, just to name a few measures. So it looks like Brown's crusade has been reinvigorated and he has a Republican on his side too (Wall Street loves the word 'bipartisan'). Sure, Elizabeth Warren is someone to watch, but Wall Street better keep an eye on Brown and Vitter too. They're already on the move. Watch Brown's presentation in the video below: 
smallbox/flickrScott Adams, creator of the comic-strip "Dilbert," believes financial markets are a vast conspiracy and that stocks are set to plunge 20 percent (h/t Josh Brown).† In a strange new blog post, Adams says stock movements are †controlled by a figurative "network of big players" who lure in small-time investors only to set them up for disaster. He seems to be dead serious. Here's the main part of the post: When I say there is manipulation and collusion in the financial markets, it doesn't mean there are actual meetings in which billionaires smoke cigars, drink expensive cognac, and make their evil plans. It might be enough that they are all so aware of each other's moves that they just play follow-the-leader and do so faster than small investors. The sort of market manipulation I'm describing only requires one billionaire leader who is closely watched by the other billionaires. When he sells, they sell, and they all understand why. †The big players who time it right get a 40% gain for the year while the underlying value of their stocks is unchanged at the end of it all. It is the perfect crime.Does any of that sound plausible to you? Or do you believe the markets are mostly honest, give or take a few high profile cases of insider trading?Normally I wouldn't buy into a conspiracy theory that has no smoking gun type of evidence. But financial markets are a unique situation. When you give people in that industry the motive, the opportunity, and a near-zero chance of getting caught, how can you expect them to play fair? The bigger shock to me would be to learn that the markets are free of manipulation. That would be a violation of everything I know about human nature. He concludes by saying stocks will fall 20 percent this year, though will eventually correct to current levels.
In a new note to clients, UBS's U.S. economics team led by Maury Harris and Drew Matus includes a chart breaking down the savings rates of Americans in various income levels. As expected, people making more money save a bigger chunk of their paychecks. Harris and Matus argue we should take note of this because they believe this buffer will blunt the impact of recent tax hikes. "We believe that the recently legislated higher household sector taxes in 2013 considerably overstate the related negative consumption impacts," they write.¬† Here's more: Higher Federal income taxes on relatively wealthy taxpayers should be accompanied by a drop in savings that limits the negative near-term consumer spending impact. Saving rates increase sharply at higher income levels, with the saving rate estimated at 51 cents on the dollar for the top 1% of the income distribution and 37 cents on the dollar for the top 5%. The higher top marginal tax rate apparently is limited to incomes within the top 1%, with the phase out of personal exemptions and itemized deductions limited to just the top few percent of the income distribution. Here's the chart: UBS

WealthTrack via YouTubeUnlike most bears on the economy, Gluskin Sheff economist David Rosenberg believes interest rates will stay low for a while and that cash isn't the much of a safe haven. In a post for Canada's Financial Post, Rosenberg argues that people with cash is sitting on the sidelines will get no returns because the Fed will keep rates near zero as long as unemployment is high.¬† And Rosenberg thinks unemployment will be high for a while. From his post: People think their money is safe in cash, but it isn‚Äôt. Ben Bernanke is telling us that for the greater good of trying to redeploy the US$9-trillion now sitting in bank deposits, mattresses and T-bills, he is going to penalize acute risk aversion and hope that some of that cash finds its ways into more productive assets across the capital structure such as corporate bonds or some form of income equity. The one thing we know with certainty is that Mr. Bernanke is going to punish and relegate investors who are sitting in cash to negative real returns, not just for another five months or five quarters, but five more years, and therefore cash is arguably the least safe asset class to be in today. It makes the case for capital preservation and preservation of cash flows in the debt and equity markets and alternatives all that much more compelling. Any wall of worry can be vaulted when Helicopter Ben chases you out of your safe haven. Read the whole post at FinancialPost.com.
(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images) Every year, investors look forward Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway annual report, and it's not because they love analyzing the holding companies expenses. The report is valuable because it comes with a letter from the Oracle of Omaha discussing his thoughts on markets, investing, finance and more. So to get you ready for this year's letter, which comes out today at 4:00 p.m., Business Insider went back through Buffett's letters starting in 2010 and grabbed some of our favorite insights. Some of these are meditations on management, others are on investing strategy. There are even some predictions that have come true.
Getty Images / Matthew PeytonWarren Buffett, 2006Warren Buffett's annual letter to shareholders is always a must-read. It's safe to argue Buffett's entire archive of letters make for great reading. But if you you don't have the time to read all of them, which ones should you definitely read? To get a handle on this, we talked to software developer and Warren Buffett aficionado Steve Ritter, who has read every letter and goes to Berkshire's annual meetings each year. He gave us his top 5 must-reads. Buffett's 1977 letter is the earliest one available in the Berkshire Hathaway online archive. Right away, Buffett tackles the notion that earnings performance is a good way to measure managerial performance: Except for special cases (for example, companies with unusual debt-equity ratios or those with important assets carried at unrealistic balance sheet values), we believe a more appropriate measure of managerial economic performance to be return on equity capital. In 1977 our operating earnings on beginning equity capital amounted to 19%, slightly better than last year and above both our own long-term average and that of American industry in aggregate. But, while our operating earnings per share were up 37% from the year before, our beginning capital was up 24%, making the gain in earnings per share considerably less impressive than it might appear at first glance. In his 1983 letter, Buffett wrote about the importance of "economic goodwill" in the companies he invested in: We own several businesses that possess economic Goodwill (which is properly includable in intrinsic business value) far larger than the accounting Goodwill that is carried on our balance sheet and reflected in book value... ...You can live a full and rewarding life without ever thinking¬†about Goodwill and its amortization. But students of investment¬†and management should understand the nuances of the subject. My¬†own thinking has changed drastically from 35 years ago when I was¬†taught to favor tangible assets and to shun businesses whose¬†value depended largely upon economic Goodwill. This bias caused¬†me to make many important business mistakes of omission, although¬†relatively few of commission. The next year, in 1984, Berkshire highlighted its purchase of Nebraska Furniture Mart. Buffett was a huge fan of NFM's chairman, the 91-year-old Rose Blumkin, who he affectionately referred to as "Mrs. B." Here's an excerpt: I have been asked by a number of people just what secrets the Blumkins bring to their business. These are not very esoteric. All members of the family: (1) apply themselves with an enthusiasm and energy that would make Ben Franklin and Horatio Alger look like dropouts; (2) define with extraordinary realism their area of special competence and act decisively on all matters within it; (3) ignore even the most enticing propositions failing outside of that area of special competence; and, (4) unfailingly behave in a high-grade manner with everyone they deal with. (Mrs. B boils it down to ‚Äúsell cheap and tell the truth‚Äù.) Our evaluation of the integrity of Mrs. B and her family was¬†demonstrated when we purchased 90% of the business: NFM had never¬†had an audit and we did not request one; we did not take an¬†inventory nor verify the receivables; we did not check property¬†titles. We gave Mrs. B a check for $55 million and she gave us¬†her word. That made for an even exchange. That's trust. Buffett is a long-time investor in the insurance business. In his 2001 letter, he described the economics of the industry, writing, "Our main business ‚Äì though we have others of great importance ‚Äì is insurance. To understand¬†Berkshire, therefore, it is necessary that you understand how to evaluate an insurance company." Buffett reflects on the World Trade Center attacks of September 11, 2001, and how the prospect of terrorism altered the insurance business: The events of September 11th made it clear that our implementation of rules 1 and 2 at General Re had been¬†dangerously weak. In setting prices and also in evaluating aggregation risk, we had either overlooked or dismissed¬†the possibility of large-scale terrorism losses. That was a relevant underwriting factor, and we ignored it. In pricing property coverages, for example, we had looked to the past and taken into account only costs we¬†might expect to incur from windstorm, fire, explosion and earthquake. But what will be the largest insured property¬†loss in history (after adding related business-interruption claims) originated from none of these forces. In short, all¬†of us in the industry made a fundamental underwriting mistake by focusing on experience, rather than exposure,¬†thereby assuming a huge terrorism risk for which we received no premium. Finally, there was 2008 ‚Äì the year of the Lehman Brothers failure and the global financial crisis. Buffett's 2008 letter is pretty wide-ranging, given the lessons investors learned that year. In one section, Buffett touched on the dangers of derivatives, which played a big part in the crisis. Buffett, as a long-time investor in the insurance business, had plenty of experience with the instruments himself. He wrote: Indeed, recent events demonstrate that certain big-name CEOs (or former CEOs) at major financial¬†institutions were simply incapable of managing a business with a huge, complex book of derivatives. Include¬†Charlie and me in this hapless group: When Berkshire purchased General Re in 1998, we knew we could not get¬†our minds around its book of 23,218 derivatives contracts, made with 884 counterparties (many of which we had¬†never heard of). So we decided to close up shop. Though we were under no pressure and were operating in¬†benign markets as we exited, it took us five years and more than $400 million in losses to largely complete the¬†task. Upon leaving, our feelings about the business mirrored a line in a country song: ‚ÄúI liked you better before I¬†got to know you so well.‚Äù Improved ‚Äútransparency‚Äù ‚Äì a favorite remedy of politicians, commentators and financial regulators for¬†averting future train wrecks ‚Äì won‚Äôt cure the problems that derivatives pose. I know of no reporting mechanism¬†that would come close to describing and measuring the risks in a huge and complex portfolio of derivatives.¬†Auditors can‚Äôt audit these contracts, and regulators can‚Äôt regulate them. When I read the pages of ‚Äúdisclosure‚Äù in 10-Ks of companies that are entangled with these instruments, all I end up knowing is that I don‚Äôt know what is¬†going on in their portfolios (and then I reach for some aspirin). The excerpts above are, of course, only a very small sample of the type of writing that has made Buffett's letters a must-read for investors year-in and year-out.

APPresident Barack Obama delivered surprise remarks on the sequester Friday morning, once again slamming Republicans for the across-the-board budget cuts that are scheduled to take effect at midnight.† Sequester "is happening because of a choice that Republicans made," Obama said, adding that the GOP's unwillingness to prevent the sequester indicates that the party is "out of step" with the rest of the country.† "We just need Congress to catch up with their own party and country with this," Obama said. "If they did so, we could make a lot of progress. I do know that there are Republicans in Congress who privately, at least, say that they would rather close tax loopholes than let these cuts go through. I know that there are Democrats who would rather do entitlement reform than let these cuts go through." "There is a caucus of common sense up on Capitol Hill," Obama "It's a silent group right now, and we want to make sure that their voices start getting heard." The Obama administration has spent the past 10 days warning Americans about the disastrous consequences of the budget cuts, which will affect both military and non-defense government spending. Now that the cuts are virtually guaranteed to happen, however, the President hedged his doomsday rhetoric, telling reporters that "not everyone will feel the cuts right away."† "The pain, though, will be real,î Obama said. ìAll of this will cause a ripple effect throughout our economy.î But, he added later, "this is not going be the apocalypse...it's just dumb." The President's surprise remarks followed his eleventh-hour meeting with Congressional leaders to discuss the sequester. But with Congress adjourned for a three-day weekend recess, there was little chance that the talks would result in a solution.  In a readout of the meeting, a spokesperson for House Speaker John Boehner reitereated that Republicans would not accept any new revenues as part of a sequester deal.† "I am not a dictator, I'm the President," Obama told reporters Friday. "Ultimately, if Mitch McConnell or John Boehner say, we need to go to catch a plane, I can't have Secret Service block the doorway." "I can't do a Jedi mind-meld" to force Congress to agree to a deal, he added.
The recent chaotic election in Italy has brought political uncertainty back to the Eurozone, and it may have even contributed to the recent spike in volatility in the global financial markets. However, Goldman Sachs economist Jim O'Neill finds all of this very exciting. While he acknowledges that Italian political gridlock is a nightmare scenario for others in Europe, he believes that change may finally be coming to Italy, which has seen its GDP effectively go nowhere for years. In his latest Viewpoints note, he lists offers three observations about the Italian election: I will be attending a well-known financial forum on the shores of Lake Como late next week, and in that sense, post the uncertain outcome delivered by the Italian electorate, it will be interesting to hear the debate at the forum (although I will be fresh from much bigger excitement at Old Trafford earlier in the week). For now, I have three observations about the Italian election outcome. Firstly, perhaps somewhat oddly, I find the outcome quite exciting because it seems to me for a country whoís GDP has basically not changed since EMU started in 1999, something big needs to change. Maybe this election outcome and the peculiar mass appeal of the Five Star movement could signal the start of something new? Secondly, for the established elite of Italy and, crucially, the other ëpower centresí of Europe, in particular Berlin and Frankfurt, these results are pretty close to a nightmare. Indeed, it questions many aspects of the status quo, including the widespread view in such circles that debt reduction for the sake of debt reduction is not only a worthy cause, but one that is necessary to attract policy support. If such a consensus were open to change, they should question this belief but I suspect it wonít come quickly or easily. Thirdly and linked to this, in my view, Italyís real problem is the absence of economic growth, which has caused debt to rise, and not the same problems as some other problematic Euro-zone countries. Italyís cyclically-adjusted fiscal position is actually in modest surplus (see table below), which is better than virtually all other developed countries. I believe that tightening fiscal policy for the sake of it with a vague aim of debt reduction is not a smart strategy. Italy needs to reform its product and labour markets, boost nationwide productivity and reform. They also need German and ECB support in order to stay in the EMU, and especially now, to stop a potentially fresh escalation of unnecessary increases in bond yields. In Italy, reform doesnít equate to austerity as their voters have just shown. Here's the table O'Neill is referring to: Goldman Sachs Asset Management Download the whole note here.
Aspen Photo / Shutterstock.comIn news that will shock no-one, earning a Crimson pedigree may be the surest-fire way to amassing greenbacks. Almost 3,000 graduates¬†of Harvard¬†University¬†are worth more than $30 million¬†(each), according to rankings compiled by market research firm Wealth-X seen by Quartz, and most of them earned the money themselves. That‚Äôs more than twice the number of what Wealth-X calls¬†‚Äùultra-high-net-worth individuals‚Äù (UHNWIs) produced by any other institution in the world. (The report, by the way, counts both undergraduate and graduate degrees.) That Harvard‚Äôs a multi-millionaire factory probably surprises exactly no one. But here are some report findings that might: Of course, the top of the list is rather dense with Ivy. But even among top schools, wealth varies greatly: while the University of Pennsylvania and Columbia University graduated¬†a combined 2,390 UHNWIs, Yale, Princeton and Cornell count among them only 1,604, in total. Of the US schools in Wealth-X‚Äôs Global top 20, just three are public: University of Virginia, the University of Michigan and University of California, Berkeley. At least in the US, having a business school probably helps. The top five on the global list‚ÄîHarvard, Penn, Stanford University, Columbia and New York University, in that order‚Äîall have top-flight MBA programs. Of the top 15, only Princeton lacks a B-school. On the non-US list, meanwhile, France‚Äôs Insead and LBS are both exclusively graduate business schools. Proximity to Hollywood and Silicon Valley may help, as well, though. Combining Wealth-X‚Äôs lists of public and private universities, the ranking Californian schools put out the most UHNWIs, with 4,672 of them‚Äîmore even than posh school-dense Massachusetts, which produced 4,198. Nearly one-quarter of Brown‚Äôs and Cornell‚Äôs UHNWIs‚Äô ultra-high net worths came exclusively from inheritance. And around two-fifths¬†of the super-rich from Penn, Columbia, Northwestern and Boston¬†University¬†made the list thanks to old money alone. What of the nouveau riche? At the University of Virginia, which also happens to be the highest-ranked public¬†university, some 78% of the¬†√ºber-rich were self-made. Harvard, Chicago, Princeton and New York University were close behind. Quartz  Women who want to strike it rich should consider Northwestern and Brown Universities‚Äîalmost 15% of their UHNWIs are women, compared with 2%-4% for the University of Chicago, MIT, and Yale. But in terms of raw numbers, Harvard produces the most ultra-affluent women: Quartz On the international list, Australia‚Äôs Monash University has the highest proportion, with 17%. The UK is churning out top-earners too, though. UHNWI alumni of Oxford and Cambridge totaled 401 and 361, respectively, breaking into the global top 20. And Wealth-X‚Äôs non-US ranking included four more: the London School of Economics, Imperial College of London, the London School of Business, and University College London. The University of Mumbai was the only university outside of¬†the US and the UK to make the top 20, with it 372 UHNWIs worth a combined $37 billion. Of emerging-market universities, India‚Äôs University of Mumbai and University of Delhi produced 601 super-rich alumni, while China‚Äôs Tsinghua and Peking Universities together graduated 291. In addition to simply having the most UHNWIs, Harvard also boasts the most billionaire¬†alumni‚Äî52 of them, to be exact. But in the top 10 of UHNWIs from schools that made Wealth-X‚Äôs list, it only has one (Brazil‚Äôs¬†Jorge Lemann, who just co-bought Heinz): ¬†Quartz
BloombergTV Barack Obama is giving a little speech/press conference on the sequestration that is starting today. He's blasting the Republicans for letting these cuts go through, and arguing correctly that they will harm the economy. But he's also presenting a false choice. He's saying that the reasons the cuts are going forward as they are is because the Republicans aren't agreeing to any deficit reduction in terms of closing tax loopholes. But that's not the only choice. We could just cancel the cuts, and not replace them anything. Obama's frame only makes sense if there's some existential reason that we need to have deficit reduction now. There isn't. It's totally arbitrary. And someone should be making the case to cancel the cuts, without making up the deficit reduction elsewhere. For Obama's full comments, see here &gt;
Imagine a plot to undermine the government of the United States, to destroy much of its capacity to do the publicís business, and to sow distrust among the population. Imagine further that the plotters infiltrate Congress and state governments, reshape their districts to give them disproportionate influence in Washington, and use the media to spread big lies about the government. Finally, imagine they not only paralyze the government but are on the verge of dismantling pieces of it.Far-fetched?††Perhaps. But take a look at whatís been happening in Washington and many state capitals since Tea Party fanatics gained effective control of the Republican Party, and youíd be forgiven if you see parallels. Tea Party Republicans are crowing about the ìsequestrationî cuts beginning today (Friday). ìThis will be the first significant tea party victory in that we got what we set out to do in changing Washington,î says Rep. Tim Huelskamp (Kan.), a Tea Partier who was first elected in 2010. Sequestration is only the start. What they set out to do was not simply change Washington but eviscerate the U.S. government ó ìdrown it†in the bathtub,î in the words of their guru Grover Norquist ñ slashing Social Security and Medicare, ending worker protections weíve had since the 1930s, eroding civil rights and voting rights, terminating programs that have helped the poor for generations, and making it impossible for the government to invest in our future. Sequestration grew out of a strategy hatched soon after they took over the House in 2011, to achieve their goals by holding hostage the full faith and credit of the United States ñ notwithstanding the Constitutionís instruction that the public debt of the United States ìnot be questioned.î To avoid default on the public debt, the White House and House Republicans agreed to harsh and arbitrary ìsequesteredî spending cuts if they couldnít come up with a more reasonable deal in the interim. But the Tea Partiers had no intention of agreeing to anything more reasonable. They knew the only way to dismember the federal government was through large spending cuts without tax increases. Nor do they seem to mind the higher unemployment their strategy will almost certainly bring about. Sequestration combined with Januaryís fiscal cliff deal is expected to slow economic growth by 1.5 percentage points this year ñ dangerous for an economy now crawling at about 2 percent. It will be even worse if the Tea Partiers† refuse to extend the governmentís spending authority, which expires March 27. A conspiracy theorist might think they welcome more joblessness because they want Americans to be even more fearful and angry. Tea Partiers use fear and anger in their war against the government ñ blaming the anemic recovery on government deficits and the governmentís size, and selling a poisonous snake-oil of austerity economics and trickle-down economics as the remedy. They likewise use the disruption and paralysis theyíve sown in Washington to persuade Americans government is necessarily dysfunctional, and†politics inherently bad. Their continuing showdowns and standoffs are, in this sense, part of the plot.†† What is the Presidentís response? He still wants a so-called ìgrand bargainî of ìbalancedî spending cuts (including cuts in the projected growth of Social Security and Medicare) combined with tax increases on the wealthy. So far, though, he has agreed to a gross imbalance ó $1.5 trillion in cuts to Republicansí $600 billion in tax increases on the rich. The President apparently believes Republicans are serious about deficit reduction, when in fact the Tea Partiers now running the GOP are serious only about dismembering the government.† And he seems to accept that the budget deficit is the largest economic problem facing the nation, when in reality the largest problem is continuing high unemployment (some 20 million Americans unemployed or under-employed), declining real wages, and widening inequality.†Deficit reduction now or in the near-term will only make these worse. Besides, the deficit is now down to about 5 percent of GDP ñ where it was when Bill Clinton took office. It is projected to mushroom in later years mainly because healthcare costs are expected to rise faster than the economy is expected to grow, and the American population is aging. These trends have little or nothing to do with government programs. In fact, Medicare is far more efficient than private health insurance. I suggest the President forget about a ìgrand bargain.î In fact, he should stop talking about the budget deficit and start talking about jobs and wages, and widening inequality ñ as he did in the campaign. And he should give up all hope of making a deal with the Tea Partiers who now run the Republican Party. Instead, the President should let the public see the Tea Partiers for who they are ó a small, radical minority intent on dismantling the government of the United States. As long as they are allowed to dictate the terms of public debate they will continue to hold the rest of us hostage to their extremism. Read more posts on Contributor ª
The introduction of the sequester -- the automatic across the board spending cuts that will kick in starting today --¬† is the first real fiscal tightening that the US has engaged in since the crisis ended. There's a widespread feeling that it's premature and going to be harmful to the economy, which remains mired in weak growth and unemployment that's too thigh. This has ominous parallels to Japan, which also saw several bouts of premature tightening (fiscal and monetary) during its long slump. And not only that, the tightening (and then subsequent loosening) frequently coincided with downturns in the market. This is one of our favorite charts, which we've posted a few times over the last few years, showing Japan's TOPIX index with every tightening and easing.

Note from dshort: This commentary has been revised to include this morning's release of the January data for Real Personal Income Less Transfer Payments. Official recession calls are the responsibility of the NBER Business Cycle Dating Committee, which is understandably vague about the specific indicators on which they base their decisions. This committee statement is about as close as they get to identifying their method. There is, however, a general belief that there are four big indicators that the committee weighs heavily in their cycle identification process. They are: I've now updated this commentary to include the January Personal Income data, the red line in the chart below. As expected, the January brought the inevitable reversal of the dramatic advance in the November and December data, which was a result of moving income forward to manage the tax risk in anticipation of the Fiscal Cliff. The -4.7% decline in January essentially cancels the 1.4% rise in November and 3% rise in December. The January year-over-year number probably gives us a better sense of the economic reality: Personal Incomes Less Transfer Payments are essentially flat -- up a tiny 0.7%. The chart and table below illustrate the performance of the Big Four and simple average of the four since the end of the Great Recession. At this point, the average of the Big Four (the gray line in the chart) is showing contraction. But the Personal Income blip, discussed above, is largely responsible for this step back. The February data will be critical for determining the direction of the economy. Industrial Production and Retail Sales were both weak in January, and the trend in Personal Income, minus the tax-strategy blip, has been flat to faltering since the middle of last year. The pain of the 2% FICA increase will eventually wear off, but it may continue to be a factor in the first quarter. But of course all recent data are subject to further revision, so we must view these numbers accordingly. At this point the economy faces some major headwinds: Political battles over the debt ceiling, the imminent impact of sequestration and the continuing pressure from the 2% FICA tax increase on incomes, spending and ultimately production. The charts above don't show us the individual behavior of the Big Four leading up to the 2007 recession. To achieve that goal, I've plotted the same data using a "percent off high" technique. In other words, I show successive new highs as zero and the cumulative percent declines of months that aren't new highs. The advantage of this approach is that it helps us visualize declines more clearly and to compare the depth of declines for each indicator and across time (e.g., the short 2001 recession versus the Great Recession). Here is my own four-pack showing the indicators with this technique. Now let's examine the behavior of these indicators across time. The first chart below graphs the period from 2000 to the present, thereby showing us the behavior of the four indicators before and after the two most recent recessions. Rather than having four separate charts, I've created an overlay to help us evaluate the relative behavior of the indicators at the cycle peaks and troughs. (See my note below on recession boundaries). ¬† ¬† The chart above is an excellent starting point for evaluating the relevance of the four indicators in the context of two very different recessions. In both cases, the bounce in Industrial Production matches the NBER trough while Employment and Personal Incomes lagged in their respective reversals. As for the start of these two 21st century recessions, the indicator declines are less uniform in their behavior. We can see, however, that Employment and Personal Income were laggards in the declines. Now let's look at the 1972-1985 period, which included three recessions -- the savage 16-month Oil Embargo recession of 1973-1975 and the double dip of 1980 and 1981-1982 (6-months and 16-months, respectively). ¬† ¬† And finally, for sharp-eyed readers who can don't mind squinting at a lot of data, here's a cluttered chart from 1959 to the present. That is the earliest date for which all four indicators are available. The main lesson of this chart is the diverse patterns and volatility across time for these indicators. For example, retail sales and industrial production are far more volatile than employment and income. ¬† ¬† History tells us the brief periods of contraction are not uncommon, as we can see in this big picture since 1959, the same chart as the one above, but showing the average of the four rather than the individual indicators. ¬† ¬† The chart clearly illustrates the savagery of the last recession. It was much deeper than the closest contender in this timeframe, the 1973-1975 Oil Embargo recession. While we've yet to set new highs, the trend has collectively been upward. But a closer look at the average shows a clear slowing of the trend in 2012. ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Each of the four major indicators discussed in this article are illustrated below in three different data manipulations: The US Industrial Production Index (INDPRO) is the oldest of the four indicators, stretching back to 1919. The log scale of the first chart is particularly useful in showing the correlation between this indicator and early 20th century recessions. ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† This data series is computed as by taking Personal Income (PI) less Personal Current Transfer Receipts (PCTR) and deflated using the Personal Consumption Expenditure Price Index (PCEPI). I've chained the data to the latest price index value. The "Tax Planning Strategies" annotation refers to shifting income into the current year to avoid a real or expected tax increase. ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† There are many ways to plot employment. The one referenced by the Federal Reserve researchers as one of the NBER indicators is Total Nonfarm Employees (PAYEMS). ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† This indicator is a splicing of the discontinued retail sales series (RETAIL, discontinued in April 2001) spliced with the Retail and Food Services Sales (RSAFS) and deflated by the Consumer Price Index (CPIAUCSL). I used a splice point of January 1995 because that was date mentioned in the FRED notes. My experiments with other splice techniques (e.g., 1992, 2001 or using an average of the overlapping years) didn't make a meaningful difference in the behavior of the indicator in proximity to recessions. I've chained the data to the latest CPI value. ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† This indicator is a splice of two seasonally adjusted series tracked by the BEA. The 1967-1996 component is SIC (Standard Industrial Classification) based and the 1997-present is NAICS (North American Industry Classification System) based. The data are available from the BEA website. See Section 0 - Real Inventories and Sales and look for Tables 2AU and 2BU. The FRED economists use the Real Retail Sales above for their four-pack. However, ECRI appears to use this series as their key indicator for sales. Note that the Manufacturing and Trade Sales data is updated monthly with the BEA's Personal Consumption and Expenditures release, but the numbers lag by one month from the other PCE data. ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†  Note: I represent recessions as the peak month through the month preceding the trough to highlight the recessions in the charts above. For example, the NBER dates the last cycle peak as December 2007, the trough as June 2009 and the duration as 18 months. The "Peak through the Period preceding the Trough" series is the one FRED uses in its monthly charts, as explained in the FRED FAQs illustrated in this Industrial Production chart.
Some 660,000 people in China's Yunnan, Gansu and Hebei provinces have been impacted by a severe drought, according to China Daily.¬† The drought has affected 18.47 million mu (approx. 3 million acres) of farmland and has created a shortage of drinking water.

Bettman CorbisOne might argue that if America actually got rid of the worst schemers on Wall Street, it would, like Batman finally cleaning up Gotham, have nothing else to do with its time. Luckily, 150 years of American financial history tell us that day will probably never come. Before Goldman Sachs, before Gordon Gekko, the original Wall Street boogeyman was Jay Gould. Raised in obscurity, Gould would go on to become the top-five richest men in America thanks to a series of aggressive, probably criminal schemes. He eventually gained a reputation so sinister that fellow Wall Street operator James Keene called him, "The worst man on earth since the beginning of the Christian era." We wanted to tell the story of this one-time towering figure, if only to show all the vampire squids out there that they're not doing anything new.¬†
JCPenney has been ambiguous about the total number of layoffs at the company. But today, CEO Ron Johnson dropped the number in court as he testified in the fight between JCPenney/Martha Stewart and Macy's.¬† Johnson said that JCPenney has laid off 19,000 employees throughout its transformation thus far, according to CNBC's Courtney Reagan. This includes in-store associates, middle managers, salon receptionists, call center workers,¬†corporate employees, and more. JCPenney had around 136,000 full- and part-time workers before the layoffs started to roll last April. The situation at headquarters was an issue. COO Michael Kramer, who was brought on by Johnson, called the culture "pathetic." Now, 1,600 of the 4,800 original home office employees have been cut. Early on,¬†JCPenney would announce job cuts. But lately, when a round hits, the company¬†hasn't been so transparent.
Last June, when Moody‚Äôs Investors Services proposed four fund accounting adjustments, it determined that the already dizzying unfunded pension liabilities were actually three times higher than reported. But now there is a new problem: how trustees across the country blow money that their squeezed pension funds don‚Äôt have on an exotic boondoggle.¬† Moody‚Äôs wants to cut through the smoke and mirrors of pension-fund accounting. Hence, its four adjustments. Though it can‚Äôt force governments to change their accounting practices, it can lower their credit ratings. So here in financially challenged California, John Dickerson (www.yourpublicmoney.com) applied these adjustments to the pension fund numbers as reported by the six counties in the Bay Area and the North Coast with independent pension funds. I‚Äôll use one of them, Contra Costa County, as an example (PDF) because it will crop up again in our boondoggle story. The pension fund reported total unfunded liabilities of $1.215 billion. After Moody‚Äôs adjustments have been applied, they explode to $3.519 billion. It gets worse. To paper over pension deficits, governments issue Pension Obligation Bonds (POB), which are often not reported as liabilities by pension funds. Pension funds grab the cash, governments hold the debt. When Contra Costa County‚Äôs $516 million in POBs are included, total unfunded pension liabilities rise to $4.037 billion‚Äîover 3.3 times the reported amount.¬† The massive shortage means that the fund won‚Äôt be able to pay the benefits it has promised its employees. Benefits will have to be cut, belts around retirees tightened. Taxpayers and employees will have to pay more. Taxpayers may have to bail out retirees outright. Municipalities have gone bankrupt in order to sort out this mess. So, California Watch shocked us with its report that four independent municipal pension systems, including Contra Costa County Employees‚Äô Retirement Association, are paying for up to five trustees each to attend a conference. Not in Los Angeles or San Francisco or Berkley. But thousands of miles away, in ... Hawaii. For six days in May, at the Hilton Hawaiian Village Waikiki Beach Resort, with plenty of time off to play, surf, roll around the beach, or stare, sweating glass in hand, at the chicks by one of the five pools. Well actually, this being California, it didn‚Äôt shock us. But it‚Äôs not just here. The National Conference on Public Employee Retirement System marketed the shindig across the country. It expects about 1,000 attendees, including 800 trustees. Registration fees can run over $1,000, plus airfare, 5 or 6 nights at the hotel, and other expenses. The money comes from taxpayers, employees, and retirees whose pensions are at risk because there isn‚Äôt enough money. Contra Costa County is sending five trustees. The pension funds of the city of Los Angeles, Los Angeles County, and San Diego County will also send trustees. Combined, they reported $17.5 billion in unfunded pension liabilities. And based on Moody‚Äôs adjustment, reality could be three times higher, so perhaps over $50 billion. Expecting resistance, the conference offers a ‚Äú2013 Attendance Justification Tool Kit‚Äú for trustees who have trouble finding the right words to explain exactly why that trip to Hawaii and six nights at the Hilton Hawaiian Village Waikiki Beach Resort are essential for the survival of the strung-out fund and its billions in unfunded liabilities. The Justification Tool Kit includes a well-written ‚Äúsample justification letter,‚Äù a Word document that you can download and ‚Äúedit to personalize your message.‚Äù Or you can just fill in the blanks. There are also ‚Äú7 Tips for Building Your Case for Attending the Annual Conference‚Äù‚Äîcrucial things to do and say to bamboozle everyone into agreeing that that expense is the best investment the fund ever made. ‚ÄúFocus on the issue at hand,‚Äù is the first recommendation. Truly an excellent Justification Tool Kit. Other pension plans send their trustees to in-state seminars, which are a lot cheaper and fulfill any educational requirements just as well. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs real easy to keep it in California,‚Äù explained Greg Frank, a management analyst at the San Joaquin County Employees‚Äô Retirement Association. Given that the funds are short billions, the expenses for this boondoggle don‚Äôt even amount to a rounding error. But when taxpayers and employees have to pay more, and when retirees have to accept smaller pensions, or watch their fund blow up or get restructured in bankruptcy, then it would be appropriate for trustees to display a crisis mentality. Because a crisis it is. And a shindig in Hawaii isn‚Äôt going to solve it. When Moody‚Äôs Investors Services, based on its adjustments, begins recalculating the effect of these unfunded pension liabilities on credit quality, it will eventually result in across-the-board slashing of municipal-bond credit ratings and numerous municipal bankruptcies in California. For that debacle, read.... California Pension Death Star¬†Approaching.
AP ImagesLegendary billionaire hedge fund manager Stan Druckenmiller, who rarely does media appearances, sat down with Bloomberg TV's Stephanie Ruhle for an hour-long interview.† Druckenmiller, who called the housing crisis, touched upon a gamut of issues such as entitlement spending, what's going on in Washington, D.C right now and the hedge fund industry. As for the recent economic downturn, here's what he said when he was asked who is to blame: "It's hard to tell who's going to be blamed-- if we don't act and this occursÖThere's plenty of blame to go around. If I had to analyze how do we get into the financial crisis, I would say it started way back in the '90s when then-Chairman Greenspan refused to address the dot-com bubble, came up with some new theory of productivity and therefore we're not going to have a problem, so all these NASDAQ companies who were never going to earn money went to hundreds-of-times earnings and then of course, we had a major bust.† And instead of taking a recession and having the cleanupÖthey needed an offset. So they created the housing bubble. So now by hindsight, everybody says, 'Well, you had these horrible Wall Street actors,' and I'm sure there were quite a few horrible Wall Street actors.† And I don't doubt that they were part of the problem.† In fact, I know they were part of the problem.† But I also know it was negative real interest rates for 12 outta 20 years that enabled these actors to do the things they were doing and incented, yes, incented them to go out and gamble the way they were gambling."

Yet again, the Oracle of Omaha's predictions have come true. Last year, in his annual investor letter, Buffett lamented his¬† $2 billion bond investment in Dallas-based Energy Future Holdings, saying it was a "huge mistake." It's an interesting company, you may remember, because it was bought out by private equity firms in the biggest leveraged buy out deal in history back in 2007 ($48 billion). You also may remember that few days ago, Bloomberg reported that Energy Future Holdings faced bankruptcy because it was facing a critical deadline on the maturity of some its loans. Here's what Buffett said about the company back in February 2012: A few years back, I spent about $2 billion buying several bond issues of Energy Future Holdings, an electric utility operation serving portions of Texas. That was a mistake ‚Äì a big mistake. In large measure, the company‚Äôs prospects were tied to the price of natural gas, which tanked shortly after our purchase and remains depressed. Though we have annually received interest payments of about $102 million since our purchase, the company‚Äôs ability to pay will soon be exhausted unless gas prices rise substantially. We wrote down our investment by $1 billion in 2010 and by an additional $390 million last year. At yearend, we carried the bonds at their market value of $878 million. If gas prices remain at present levels, we will likely face a further loss, perhaps in an amount that will virtually wipe out our current carrying value. Conversely, a substantial increase in gas prices might allow us to recoup some, or even all, of our write-down. However things turn out, I totally miscalculated the gain/loss probabilities when I purchased the bonds. In tennis parlance, this was a major unforced error by your chairman. Bloomberg pointed out the exact same issues in its reporting. Hedging contracts that Energy Future sold to shield it against fluctuations in gas prices are expiring and will disappear entirely by the end of 2014, an event that could render Energy Future insolvent, according to the creditor who declined to named. The hedges rolling off could deflate Ebitda to $1.3 billion by the end of next year, the lender said. That‚Äôs $2.2 billion less than Energy Future‚Äôs interest cost in 2012. Buffett's annual letter for 2012 comes out at 4:00 p.m. today. Consider this a reminder that you should pay attention.

REUTERS/Mike BlakeConstruction spending missed expectations falling 2.1 percent month-over-month (MoM) in January. Analysts polled by Bloomberg are looking for construction spending to rise 0.4 percent month-over-month. Last month's reading was revised up to reflect a 1.1 percent MoM rise. Click here to refresh &gt; Construction spending was up 7.1 percent on the year. Private residential constriction was flat from December levels, while public residential construction was down 0.7 percent on the month. Overall residential construction was flat. This comes after data out this month shows that housing supply is already tight.  The decline however was led by nonresidential power spending which was down 12.4 percent from last month. Investors watch this number because it offers insights into the housing market and therefore insights into homebuilder stocks. It also gives us an insight into the health of the overall economy because businesses and governments invest in new infrastructure when they are feeling confident about the economy.

APGoldman Sachs threw a party last month at Pier 36 in the Lower East Side to celebrate its new partner class, Daily Intelligencer's†Kevin Roose reports. The investment bank hasn't thrown a party after its partner dinner since 2006. † The reason the bank didn't hold parties in 2008 or 2010 is because some "might have found it offensive," a Goldman source told Roose. †Lavish parties across Wall Street pretty much disappeared after the financial crisis hit.

The Lost OgleAubrey McClendon with relative Kate UptonThe SEC has upgraded its inquiry of Chesapeake Energy's alleged failure to reveal conflict of interest to a full-blow investigation and has subpoenaed the company for information, according to a 10-K filed today. Outgoing chief Aubrey McClendon is also providing information, the filing said. Here's the exact language from the filing: On December 21, 2012, the SEC's Fort Worth Regional Office advised Chesapeake that its inquiry is continuing as an investigation and it has issued subpoenas for information and testimony. The Company, including Mr.¬†McClendon, is providing information to the SEC in connection with this matter.¬†The Company is also responding to related inquiries from other governmental and regulatory agencies and self-regulatory organizations. Last summer, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and Reuters uncovered an unusual arrangement at the country's second-largest natural gas producer that allowed McClendon to secure ¬†$1.1 billion in¬†personal loans using drilling property as collateral. The SEC launched an informal inquiry into the allegations soon after the reports came out.¬† McClendon is set to step down in April.
Warren Buffett's annual must-read shareholder letter is supposed to come out today, according to reports. But the great thing about Buffett is that all of his writing stands the test of time. Last year in his letter he made a great call on gold, explaining famously that for $9.6 trillion, you could buy all the gold in the world, and it would fit into a nice cube inside of a baseball field diamond. Or for that money, you could buy all US cropland (400 million acres) + 16 Exxon Mobils, and still have another $1 trillion in pocket money left over. As he put it, it's a no brainer. Buy the industrials and the cropland, and forget about the big block of gold. Anyway, it was a great call. We know that farmland had a blistering year, and here's a 1-year chart showing how the S&amp;P has crushed gold over the last 12 months. FRED Here's Buffett's full segment on gold. What motivates most gold purchasers is their belief that the ranks of the fearful will grow. During the past decade that belief has proved correct. Beyond that, the rising price has on its own generated additional buying enthusiasm, attracting purchasers who see the rise as validating an investment thesis. As ‚Äúbandwagon‚Äù investors join any party, they create their own truth ‚Äì for a while.Over the past 15 years, both Internet stocks and houses have demonstrated the extraordinary excesses that can be created by combining an initially sensible thesis with well-publicized rising prices. In these bubbles, an army of originally skeptical investors succumbed to the ‚Äúproof‚Äù delivered by the market, and the pool of buyers ‚Äì for a time ‚Äì expanded sufficiently to keep the bandwagon rolling. But bubbles blown large enough inevitably pop. And then the old proverb is confirmed once again: ‚ÄúWhat the wise man does in the beginning, the fool does in the end.‚Äù18Today the world‚Äôs gold stock is about 170,000 metric tons. If all of this gold were melded together, it would form a cube of about 68 feet per side. (Picture it fitting comfortably within a baseball infield.) At $1,750 per ounce ‚Äì gold‚Äôs price as I write this ‚Äì its value would be $9.6 trillion. Call this cube pile A.Let‚Äôs now create a pile B costing an equal amount. For that, we could buy all U.S. cropland (400 million acres with output of about $200 billion annually), plus 16 Exxon Mobils (the world‚Äôs most profitable company, one earning more than $40 billion annually). After these purchases, we would have about $1 trillion left over for walking-around money (no sense feeling strapped after this buying binge). Can you imagine an investor with $9.6 trillion selecting pile A over pile B?Beyond the staggering valuation given the existing stock of gold, current prices make today‚Äôs annual production of gold command about $160 billion. Buyers ‚Äì whether jewelry and industrial users, frightened individuals, or speculators ‚Äì must continually absorb this additional supply to merely maintain an equilibrium at present prices.A century from now the 400 million acres of farmland will have produced staggering amounts of corn, wheat, cotton, and other crops ‚Äì and will continue to produce that valuable bounty, whatever the currency may be. Exxon Mobil will probably have delivered trillions of dollars in dividends to its owners and will also hold assets worth many more trillions (and, remember, you get 16 Exxons). The 170,000 tons of gold will be unchanged in size and still incapable of producing anything. You can fondle the cube, but it will not respond.Admittedly, when people a century from now are fearful, it‚Äôs likely many will still rush to gold. I‚Äôm confident, however, that the $9.6 trillion current valuation of pile A will compound over the century at a rate far inferior to that achieved by pile B.

BoeingMarkit's final US PMI manufacturing index reading for the month of February is out. The headline index fell to 54.3 from the flash estimate of 55.2 published by Markit earlier this month. Anyt reading above 50 indicates expansion, though, and 54.3 represents a moderate pace of growth. However, the new export orders sub-index, the main driver behind the decline, indicated contraction in February, falling to 48.5 from last month's 51.5 reading. So, it looks like exports took a hit. The sub-index for all new orders fell to 55.4 from 57.4 last month, and the employment sub-index fell to 53.5 from 55.6, indicating a slowing but still moderate pace of expansion.

Tim Moffatt/FlickrThere are lots of datapoints coming out today. First up: Personal income and spending for January. Personal income was expected to fall by 2.4%, but it fell 3.6%. Personal spending grew as expected 0.2%. Note that the income is massively distorted due to some calendar quirks related to the fiscal cliff, and companies pulling forward dividends. There's also the element of payroll taxes dinging disposable income. BEA
Billionaire hedge fund god Stanley Druckenmiller told Bloomberg TV's Stephanie Ruhle that old people today are essentially stealing from the younger population via entitlement transfer payments. † Druckenmiller, who is known to be media shy, told Bloomberg TV that he sees "a storm coming, maybe bigger than the storm we had in 2008, 2010" and it has to do with a demographic bubble.† "But the demographic storm is just starting now. It reminds me of '05 when people just extrapolated housing prices going up for 50 yearsÖEveryone sorta lives with their rulers in the past and doesn't look at coming changes," he said. What's happening, he explained, is we have a working population now where the current workforce pays for the benefits of the seniors. †Since 2000, there have been about 4.5 to 4.8 workers per retiree. †He said by 2050 it will be only 2.4 workers per retiree. † He told Bloomberg TV that people like him need to speak out about this issue. †Just to be clear, he's not against the seniors.† "And let me just say one thing.† I am not against seniors, okay.† I love seniors.† Unfortunately I'm going to be one in the not-too-distant futures.† What I am against is current seniors to me stealing from future seniors."

When you first start in banking, you're pretty much stuck. I wouldn't risk the political capital and references for buyside to do any of the tongue-in-cheek tips I'm going to recommend below. Just pay your dues and get used to having your weekends ruined. However, once you secure an offer or you're in your second year, here are some tips to salvaging your weekend (yes it also works on the buyside). 1. Make sure you have a list rehearsed on what you have going on this weekend. Most likely someone is going to ask you what you have going on this weekend. Instead of saying "Oh I was going to grab dinner with friends" you should just rattle off your work list and then interrupt yourself by saying "Oh that reminds me, I have to go check something" 2. Run around all afternoon to look busy. Don't be the idiot standing by the chill table talking to associates/vps because that's where your boss / staffer is going to go first to drop a new deal / pitch on you. One associate in banking used to chill by the "fun" table whenever he had a staffing and wanted to scope out which analysts were free. 3. Do not grab lunch with others on Friday. It makes you look like you're free. Spend the time at your desk or eat at your desk. This also helps you finish up work faster whether you're busy or not. 4. Actually do work. Try to make Fridays your most productive day. It can be hard when people are in a good mood and talkative, but you want to be grinding away in the morning/afternoon. Even consider coming in early on Fridays so you can guarantee you're all finished by evening. For the rest of this piece, head to Wall Street Oasis&gt;

The story of the day in Europe: Horrible economic data in Europe and weak inflation numbers. As such, the ECB might have some more latitude to loosen policy in a way that's consistent with its mandate. The euro is diving. FinViz
Wikimedia CommonsWe've already had a lot of economic data over the last several hours. PMI numbers from Asia were generally decent. PMI numbers from Europe were generally terrible, with the exception of Germany. Also Eurozone unemployment is a mess. Pretty soon we're going to get to the North American act of the show. Coming up today: For more on the PMI data that's already come out, see here &gt;
The Italian election ended in disaster for the mainstream parties, who had planned to continue along with existing austerity and reforms. The huge winner was outside/comedian Beppe Grillo. Grillo did amazing among young people, who powered him to 25% of the vote in the lower house of parliament. Why did they vote for him in droves? Here are the latest youth unemployment figures from Europe. We've highlighted Italy. Eurostat
Earlier we wrote a post about the economy tragedy in Europe. But here's all you need to say: Eurozone unemployment. 11.9% in January. New record. What else do you need to know? Eurostat
The markets started the day roughly neutral. But in the last hour and a half there have been bucket loads of bad data (see: here, here, and here) both in terms of PMIs and employment. And now the market is breaking down. Most indices are in the red. Italy is getting particularly hard hit. FTSE MIB
Things continue to be very grim looking in the UK. UK PMI (a measure of the country's manufacturing performance) dropped from 50.5 to 47.9, the worst reading since November.

Twitter / @paaiiss The European economy has been a trainwreck for a long time, but there have been varying stages of it. From 2007 through 2010 or so, the European economy basically went through the same trajectory as the US. There was a violent downturn during the financial crisis, and then an upturn. But thanks to the European sovereign debt crisis, the upturn was cut short. 2011 and 2012 were devoted to solving the acute issue of European sovereign debt crisis, an issue that for now has largely gone away, via the ECB's promise of backstopping governments, so long as they agreed to austerity measures. But everyone predicted that this austerity would be devastating for growth, and now we see that playing out in 2013 in a wicked way. While the German economy is strong, the rest of Europe just stinks, as today's PMI numbers show quite nicely. This chart comparing French and German manufacturing output tells quite a story. While Germany is benefiting from strong exports, the French economy is mired in a horrible slump. Markit The bad news doesn't stop there. Just out today, some fresh bad data on French car sales. Meanwhile, no va va voom in French Feb car sales. -19.9% for Citroen -8, 5 Peugeot and -19.3 Renault y/y #Italy's unemployment rate rises to 11.7% from 11.2%. It's the highest since at least 1992. For those between 15 and 24 it's 38.7% The ECB might at some point cut rates again, which should benefit marginally. But the lack of domestic demand remains brutal. And now politics is getting worse, as the electoral crisis in Italy shows. The question is: Will anyone address it? Right now most of the rhetoric is about the importance of sticking with various austerity commitments. If nobody has the guts to change direction, there will be more Italies in the future.

Venom82HEADS UP: The world's biggest economies are releasing their February manufacturing PMI reports today and Monday. And this is our scorecard. In aggregate, the numbers show that manufacturing is slowing.¬† The JPMorgan global manufacturing PMI fell to 50.8 from 51.4 in January. However, any number above 50 indicates expansion. The early read in Asia is that manufacturing has either decelerated or declined. China's official PMI unexpectedly fell to 50.1 from 50.4 a month ago. China's unofficial HSBC PMI fell to 50.4 from 52.3. Both fell slightly short of expectations. However, economists warn that these reports are likely to be impacted significantly by the Chinese New Year holiday. China is the second largest economy in the world, and it's a key source of growth for every other economy.¬† At the very least, it's encouraging to see both number above 50, which means China's manufacturing industry continues to grow. Eurozone's manufacturing sector remains in deep contraction with Spain and France getting worse. Italy, however, appears to be stabilizing and Germany is actually growing. At the beginning of each month, Markit, HSBC, RBC, JP Morgan and several other major data gathering institutions publish the latest local readings of the manufacturing¬†purchasing managers index (PMI) for countries around the world. PMI is one of the best leading indicators of the economy.¬† Each reading is based on surveys of hundreds of companies. Read more about it at Markit. These are not the most closely followed data points.¬† However, the power of the insights is unparalleled. Jim O'Neill, Chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, believes the PMI numbers are among the most reliable economic indicators in the world.¬† BlackRock's Russ Koesterich thinks it's one of the most underrated indicators. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- SCORECARD (All Time ET)
Thanks to surging exports, the one strong man of Europe continues to look strong. While French, Italian, and Spain all clocked in with PMI readings that showed their manufacturing sectors were varying degrees of horrible, Germany is strong. Thanks to exports, its number is back above 50, specifically 50.3, up from 49.8. Markit
And here's another ugly European PMI reading from France. Remember, in this manufacturing survey, anything below 50 is contraction. And France came in at well below 50. 43.9 is consistent with deep contraction, although at least it's better than the 42.9 last month. Markit
More bad news for Italy. The country's PMI just came in at a big whiff. The number for February came in at 45.8 from 47.8. A major drop. This is a 3-month low. Markit
This is a classic case of green shoots. Spanish PMI came in at 46.8, which is well below 50 signalling contraction. But the number was up from 46.1 last month. And the number was the highest since the middle of 2011. So classic green shoots. Still getting worse, but at a slower pace. Here's the quick summary. Markit
dbking, FlickrLadies and gentlemen, welcome to sequestration. It's begun. It's March 1, and there's still no deal to avert automatic, across the board spending cuts that were agreed to as part of the 2011 deal to raise the debt ceiling. So far the market hasn't seemed to care at all about the cuts, yet the media, various agencies, the government, and defense hawks have said they will be disastrous. Either people don't care, or they expect the cuts will soon be reversed, or some combination. In the meantime, markets are going nowhere. And we've got scads of economic data coming up today, from PMI numbers, to construction and consumer confidence. Strap in!
Maxine Waters has said that the sequester could cost as many as 170,000,000 jobs. That would be some feat Maxine, there are only 150m workers in the country. I doubt the sequester will put them all out of work, much less the extra 20m. The CBO did a quick review of the sequester today. The cuts for the balance of the fiscal year come to $42b; an amount that is equivalent to 45 points on Apple‚Äôs market capitalization. I have trouble believing that the country is going to fall off the cliff with a 2% cut in government spending. The sequester was designed to be a meat axe. The assumption by most observers was that it was would be such a dumb thing to implement, that both sides would come up with a more workable alternative. This sets up the worst-case scenario where a relatively small reduction in spending results in headline problems. While Ms Water‚Äôs projections will not be realized, there could be flight delays, disruptions in the food supply and other visible issues. If some of the scare talk about the sequester becomes a reality, there is going to be hell to pay. The question is, Who is going to get blamed? Obama won the election. Mitt got 47% of the votes, Obama got 51%. There is no mandate behind that result. Of those over 18, only 58% voted. The 120 million who did not vote may not have cared about the election, but their voices might be heard if the grocery store runs out of meat. I would not be surprised if some of the 30 million teenagers get involved. The answer to the question of who gets blamed is, ‚ÄúAll of them‚Äù.¬† I see a silver lining in that outcome. As stupid as the sequester is, I hope it causes all sorts of distortions. I want Obama to take every step possible to make it as painful as possible. (I think the President will do just that.) His motivation will be to get public support to swing further from the Republicans. Obama might end up with a public reaction that he can‚Äôt contain. Not much of a legacy. ¬† Notes: - S&amp;P plays into this story. When it downgraded the USA it made the reasoning behind the decision clear. It was not a reflection of the inherent strength of the USA, the reason was the inability of D.C. to do anything but go from month-to-month year-to-year with no budgets and no plans. On that basis, I thought the downgrade was justified. Based on what is about to unfold, another notch downward would also be justified. - The Sequester may prove to be a pain in the ass that causes more problems than anticipated. It‚Äôs still a side show to the Main Event. There are now 26 days before the government is forced to shut down. Either a budget is passed by Congress or a Continuing Resolution is required. As of today, I see zero possibility of a fix on on the CR.
This Great Graphic was posted on the FT Alphaville, which in turn appears to have gotten it from Credit Suisse, who relied on Thomson Reuters data. A prevalent monetarist argument is that foreign exchange prices should reflect the relative changes in the stock of money.¬† This is part of the reason why some many expect QE to be negative for a currency.¬† This is especially true of the US, where many expect the aggressiveness of QE3+ (QE infinity in derision) to have undermined the dollar.¬† We showed in an earlier post that the actual performance of the dollar since QE3+¬† was announced in mid-September is not what many would have expected.¬† And more:¬† if one ignored QE completely and instead focused on ECB and EU efforts to reduce boost confidence that EMU is not about to implode or cease and the chasing of fund managers who were caught wrong-footed (first being under weight European bonds and stocks then being underweight Japanese equities) one have a better chance of understanding what is driven the dollar. Marc Chandler The charts here show that China has had more rapid growth in its money supply in absolute terms and relative to GDP than Japan, the euro zone and the US.¬† Moreover, the growth in US M2 relative to GDP has been the slowest of these countries/regions.¬† Just like Milton Friedman taught that one should not confuse low nominal rates with easy policy, one should not confuse QE with rapid growth in the money supply.¬† In addition to supporting our more constructive dollar outlook, the charts also support our view that if the China reduced its management of the yuan, it is more likely to fall than appreciate, despite its trade surplus.¬† Read more posts on Marc to Market ¬ª
For some inexplicable reason, the stock market seems to be ignoring the "sequester" that goes into effect tomorrow (March 1st), and we believe the economy will be significantly affected by it.¬†¬† The consensus is that if the Sequester goes into effect, GDP will drop by approximately .6% and there will be 750,000 to 1 million jobs lost.¬† Even if we strike a "grand bargain" to avoid the "sequester," any significant rise of revenue by taxing, and spending cuts by the government, will negatively affect economic growth. The consensus GDP estimates of nine economists interviewed by Steve Liesman from CNBC, range from 2.1% to 2.9% during the four quarters of 2013.¬† The total GDP for 2011 was only 1.8%, 2012 was 2.2% and the fourth quarter was a positive 0.1%.¬†¬† Therefore, the consensus estimates from these nine economists is for a better economy this year than last year, and even this tepid forecast should be taken with a grain of salt, as the consensus has now erroneously predicted a better economy for the last three consecutive years. We have explained in other comments and "special reports" this year that there are only 4 ways to increase or decrease GDP.¬† The four ways are: 1. Consumption by individuals 2. Business investment. 3. Net trade balances and 4. Government spending.¬† The effective raising of payroll and capital gains taxes in January, as well as sharp increases in gasoline prices, will have a significant effect on personal consumption.¬† Furthermore, as businesses continue to buy back stock and hold large cash balances, there is little growth from business investment.¬† While the US Trade Balance is improving somewhat, it is a negligible factor compared to the other forces at work.¬† Finally, government spending will have to decrease even more as the debt ceiling debate in May, and Continuing Resolution (the funding of the government starting March 27th) will continually plague our policy makers in the most partisan government in US history. It is clear that the equity markets are being held up by the Fed's manipulation of the long end of the interest rate curve.¬† This week Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke testified before Congress and put up a spirited defense of Quantitative Easing (QE) in the face of some grumblings within the Fed itself.¬† All of the explanations and assurances are only valid if QE will actually stimulate the economy. If we continue to raise taxes, it will affect consumption negatively, and as we continue to cut government spending, it will subtract, dollar for dollar, from GDP.¬† Therefore, since we have already cut $2.5 trillion (tn) from the budget so far, and could cut up to $4 tn, the affect on GDP will be significant.¬† We were all able to see the effect of cutting back defense spending by 22% in the release of fourth quarter GDP, as it moved from positive to negative (and revised back to +0.1% today) .¬† It would seem to us that the chance of a recession or even severe recession is greatly increased.¬† Given the stock market's strong rise the first nine weeks of this year, we are wondering if we are the only ones that are concerned about the "sequester" or "grand bargain." The economic impact of the latest fiscal deal will slow the economy by 1.5%.¬† Sequestration will decrease GDP by approximately 0.6%.¬† These headwinds could easily push the US economy that is growing at around 2% into a recession. The immediate economic impact of the sequence of artificial deadlines won't be a sudden disaster, but more like "a death by a thousand cuts." In making these judgments, we are not expressing any opinion as to whether any given policy is right or wrong.¬† We are only attempting to analyze their effects on the economy and the market.¬† Clearly, there is an ongoing problem with excessive household debt and a long-term problem with excessive government debt.¬†¬† The dilemma is how to¬† get the economy growing again at a rate high enough to bring down the unemployment rate while, at the same time, not letting government debt soar to unsustainable levels.¬† It is the enormous difficulty of solving this problem that continues to keep us bearish on the market.
The U.S. energy revolution story continues to impress with every new stat that comes out. According to new data out of the Energy Information Association, U.S. crude oil production topped 7 million barrels per day during the November and December 2012 period. This is the highest level since December 1992. From the EIA: Increasing oil production in North Dakota and onshore Texas drove the increase in U.S. crude oil production over the last several months (although crude oil production in North Dakota took a dip in November, before increasing again in December). Much of the increase in crude oil production is coming from shale and other tight (very low permeability) formations. Initial estimates for production in November were below 7 million bbl/d, but revisions based on additional data indicate that production exceeded 7 million bbl/d in November 2012. That was followed by December production estimated to be more than 7 million bbl/d. Here's a historical look: EIA
