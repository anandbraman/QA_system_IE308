FinViz Oil is down another 1% in early going this week. But the big story is that for the last three months, oil has been getting clobbered (and crucially at a time of heightened geopolitical stress). One worry is that the decline in crude represents a flagging global economy, a possibility given the stagnation in Europe, and weakness in China. And in fact, China reported particularly weak data this weekend, which is also bringing down the Australian and New Zealand dollars. FREE AppDownload
© DPA/AFP/File Daniel NaupoldBernd Lucke, leader of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, is pictured on August 31, 2014Berlin (AFP) - Germany's fledgling anti-euro party won parliamentary seats in elections in two eastern states on Sunday, heightening an emerging threat for Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives. The Alternative for Germany (AfD), formed early last year, gained 10 percent in Thuringia state and 12 percent in Brandenburg, two weeks after also entering parliament in Saxony state, said exit polls by public broadcasters ARD and ZDF. ZDF also reported that in Thuringia the far-left Linke Party, successors East Germany's Communists, could potentially form a coalition with the centre-left Social Democrats and Greens to unseat the ruling conservatives. The AfD, headed by economics professor Bernd Lucke, is an ascendant conservative party that only narrowly missed out on entering the national parliament last September and won seven seats in European Parliament elections in May. The party, which wants Germany to leave the euro and return to the Deutschmark, denies seeking right-wing voters, but flirts with populist ideas on issues such as law and order, immigration and traditional social values.   FREE AppDownload
Andrew Burton/Getty ImagesHSBC is preparing a $6 billion issue of these bonds.It took three separate bail-outs to get KBC, a Belgian bank, through the financial crisis. So one might expect bonds that automatically get wiped out if the bank runs into trouble again to reward investors handsomely. Not so: KBC's "contingent convertible" bonds, designed to lose all their value in a crisis, yield a meagre 4% a year. Egged on by investors, banks are issuing such securities in growing amounts. Regulators are watching anxiously. Cocos, as these instruments are known, are a newish hybrid of bank equity (the money invested by shareholders, which absorbs any losses in the first instance) and debt (which must be repaid unless a bank runs out of equity). Regulators globally are keen on banks having more equity. This makes bail-outs less likely and, if they prove inevitable, less painful for taxpayers. Bankers prefer debt because it lowers their tax bill, and juices both profits and bonuses. Cocos are the compromise. Cocos take multiple forms, but all are intended to behave like bonds when times are good, yet absorb losses, equity-like, in a crisis. At a given trigger point, when equity levels are so low that bankruptcy threatens, cocos either lose some or all of their value, or get exchanged for shares. Regulators have allowed them to be used in limited quantities to meet increased equity requirements. Banks promise the coco bondholders will get "bailed in", to use the regulatory argot, in lieu of taxpayers. Fans describe cocos as "pre-funded rights issues", a metaphorical fire extinguisher in an otherwise tinder-like capital structure. But similar "hybrid" instruments misfired in the last crisis; none of the new generation of cocos has ever been tested. Some fret that coco bondholders could incur losses even as the issuer continues to reward shareholders, in defiance of fundamental laws of capitalism. Such qualms have not stopped investors from piling in, at ever lower yields (see chart). Banks have duly stepped up issuance: from nearly nothing in 2010 to $64 billion so far this year. Credit Suisse, itself a coco-issuing bank, expects at least another $20 billion by year-end. Much of this has come from big-name European lenders, such as HSBC, which is preparing a $6 billion issue. A mob of smaller banks is expected to follow suit later this year, after the European Central Bank vets their accounts. Peers in the Middle East and Asia are also lining up. Investors disagree whether cocos should be viewed as perilous bonds or slightly less risky shares. Amusingly and worryingly, a recent survey by Royal Bank of Scotland found that 90% of investors thought their understanding of cocos was better than average. Whizzy hedge funds used to dominate the market, but sleepier asset managers are investing in growing numbers. (A British regulator has banned sales to mom-and-pop investors.) Coco yields have fallen in part because banks' balance-sheets are growing sturdier. That could change in a flash, especially if the euro zone tips back into crisis. Alex Lasagna of Algebris, a hedge fund, says each bank and bond presents its own idiosyncratic risks. The diciest of them, he says, are equivalent to "picking up pennies in front of a bullet train". Regulators, who crave a simpler financial system, wonder whether cocos will make dealing with failing banks even trickier. The triggering of one coco will frighten investors away from all of them. Lawsuits will undoubtedly ensue, injecting panic at the most awkward time. Given recent experience, the watchdogs are right to be wary of anything banks are keen on.

David Beckham has been brought in to save the United Kingdom, with a new open letter urging Scots to vote NO on independence. Here's the letter, via @alanroden: David Beckham FREE AppDownload
I really liked this piece by Ben Carlson.  Particularly the conclusion: “There will always be a handful of standout market performers that earn seemingly easy profits, but that’s really a pipe dream for 99% of investors. For the rest of us, getting rich at a painstakingly slow pace is still the best option.” It’s funny how “investors” abuse the term “investing”.  What we’re really doing when we buy shares on a secondary exchange is not really “investing” at all.  It’s just an allocation of savings.  Investing, in a very technical sense, is spending for future production.  So, if you build a factory and spend money to do so then you’re investing.  But when companies issue shares to raise money they’re simply issuing those shares so they can invest.  And once those shares trade on the secondary exchange the company really doesn’t care who buys/sells them because their funds have been raised and they’ve likely already invested in future production.  You just allocate your savings by exchanging shares with other people when you buy and sell financial assets. Now, this might all sound like a bunch of semantics, but it’s really important in my opinion.  After all, when you understand the precise definitions of saving and investing you realize that our portfolios actually look more like saving accounts than investment accounts.  That is, they’re not really these sexy get rich quick vehicles.  Yes, the allure of becoming the next Warren Buffett by trading stocks is powerful.  But the reality is that you’re much more likely to get rich by making real investments, ie, spending to improve your future production.  Flipping stocks isn’t going to do that for you. This leads you to realize your portfolio is a place where you are simply trying to grow your savings at a reasonable rate without exposing it to excessive permanent loss risk or excessive purchasing power loss.  It’s not a place for gambling or getting rich quick.  In fact, it’s much the opposite.   It’s a nuanced view, but one I feel is tremendously important to financial success.

REUTERS/Gary CameronU.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen gathers her notes at the inaugural Michel Camdessus Central Banking Lecture at the International Monetary Fund in Washington July 2, 2014.  There's another Fed meeting this week, and it's a big one. On Tuesday and Wednesday, the FOMC will gather to set policy and come up with its latest forecasts about the economy and the path of interest rates. And then Janet Yellen will deliver a press conference. We'll have more in-depth analysis as we get closer to the event, but there's some context you should realize before then. The last time Yellen did a press conference after a Fed meeting was in June, and she said famously: "I think recent readings on CPI index have been a bit on the high side but I think the data we're seeing is noisy. Broadly speaking inflation is evolving in line with the committee's expectations."  That word "noisy" ended up taking on huge significance. At the time, it looked like inflation was really about to accelerate, as the economy appeared headed towards "escape velocity." Many on Wall Street assumed that Yellen was just being a dove with her head in the sand, and that it was only a matter of time before higher inflation would make her regret describing the firming CPI as "noisy." Well! Janet Yellen won the summer.  Here's a look at month-over-month readings for growth in the headline Consumer Price Index. FRED That May reading was right before Yellen spoke, and of course many people took that to signify that inflation was picking back up. But there have been two inflation readings since Yellen, and she's been vindicated. That spring inflation spike does, in retrospect, look "noisy." FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Albert GeaHundreds of thousands of Catalonians took to the streets of Barcelona this past week to show their support for independence from Spain. Right now, the eyes of the world are on Scotland, which is voting in the coming week on whether to leave the UK. The referendum in Scotland is binding. If they vote YES, then Scotland will leave after a period of negotiating the details. A trickier, potentially more explosive situation is unfolding in Spain, where the region of Catalan (which includes Barcelona) is scheduled to vote on November 9 on whether it is to leave Spain. This vote, however, is not binding or accepted at all by the Spanish government, which has said that just the vote itself is illegal. To better understand what's going on, we conducted a Q&amp;A with Matthew Bennett, editor of The Spain Report, which provides daily news and analysis about political and economic goings on in Spain. Bennett provided us with the basics of what's going on. ------------------------------ Why do so many people in Catalonia support independence? There have probably been four main drivers of the current process. Wikimedia CommonsCatalonia is in red. Secondly, the economic crisis. Over roughly the same time period, the economic crisis has happened and is still happening in Spain. There are medium- to long-term economic arguments for and against in terms of how successful a future independent Catalonia might be, or how successful the rump of Spain might be, but at this point, many supporters of Catalan independence firmly believe that they can build a successful economy at some point after secession, and be relatively better off, considering how badly Madrid has managed the economy since 2008. Thirdly, the relative strengths of Catalan National Identity vs. Spanish National Identity. 10 years ago, before the crisis, Project Spain was a strong, positive idea that attracted millions of immigrants to make a life here, centered on the construction boom. That's gone now and isn't coming back, and Spain still has some historic problems with collective national identity to solve. Catalan nationalists, in comparison, have developed a stronger, but necessarily more exclusive, collective identity and belief over the same time period. Lastly, the firm 'no' position of the current Popular Party government. In the same way as many Scots are now being convinced to vote 'yes' by panicky and restrictive Westminster politicians, Mr. Rajoy's conservative government in Madrid has taken a very firm 'no' stance since the beginning, and not just 'no' if it came to a vote, but 'no, there isn't going to be any kind of a vote, because it's illegal'. This must have convinced more than one doubter to support secession. What's happening on November 9? That depends on what happens between now and then. If we listen to the Catalan First Minister, Mr. Mas, and his parliamentary ally, Mr. Junqueras, voting stations will be opened, ballot boxes will be registered and there will be a vote on the independence of Catalonia, as promised by the Catalan government to Catalan voters. If we listen to Mr. Rajoy and Madrid, there will absolutely not be any kind of a vote on November 9 because any such vote is illegal and therefore any attempt to organise or carry one out would leave the organisers—the Catalan government and its supporters—facing criminal charges for contempt of court, sedition or rebellion. REUTERS/Javier Barbancho There is another option being tossed about in political circles this week, a way of kicking the can way down field, which involves the timings of any new regional laws and Madrid's appeal to the Constitutional Court. If they do this, they might be able to hurl the potato at the European courts, allowing Mr. Mas to say he called the referendum within the law, and Mr. Rajoy to say he blocked it, but then everyone has to wait X years for the European Court to chew over the appeal. The problem with this last option is that whilst it might save face amongst the political elite, it won't at all solve the grassroots political problem, which is that millions of Catalans, including Mr. Junqueras and his republican, left-wing secessionist party, absolutely expect a vote to be held on November 9. What effect will a "YES" vote have? Spain and Europe will have a huge problem on their hands, because Madrid's position has been, is and will likely be that any kind of secession vote is illegal. Catalonia is 19% of Spanish GDP, 26% of exports, and more than 50% of land exits to Europe. Catalonia is systemically important to Spain's economy, and Spain is systemically important to Europe's economy. I can't imagine bond traders would find that scenario positive in the short term. For Catalans to get to that stage, though, their leaders will have to take them down a path which from a Spanish legal perspective is criminal. Spain's chief public prosecutor (Attorney General equivalent) was on the radio on Friday morning reminding Spaniards that his office has been contemplating criminal scenarios that he really hoped the worst-case scenarios didn't come to pass, for the sake of coexistence among all Spaniards. So if they risk running the legal gauntlet, if Mr. Rajoy doesn't send in the police to arrest them, if the vote actually takes place and if the result is 'yes', we'd have to deal with that problem, which would likely get very chaotic as Madrid's legal position would remain the same but there would then likely be calls from the Catalans for a unilateral declaration of independence. How has the Rajoy government handled the separatist movement so far? By firmly saying 'no' every time the question has come up over the past two years, which has been very often. Not just 'no' to a possible question, but 'no' to any kind of secession vote taking place. They have stuck to a constitutional-legal interpretation of the problem, insisting that Spanish rule of law (prescriptive, based on Roman law) will be enough to see Spain through the choppy seas. They have been criticised for this stance being too legal and not political enough, and for being too dismissive and contemptuous of Catalan indy supporters rhetorically, but it is what it is and they aren't likely to change it at this late stage. Do Catalonians have a good argument that they're getting a raw deal? They think so. Madrid doesn't. As with the Scottish case, there are arguments for and against, economically, depending on which figures are thrown around in which scenarios. If Rajoy refuses to give any ground to the separatists, what leverage do they have over the rest of Spain? Three things: people, the economy and the 21st Century. First, there are a lot (1-2 million) independence supporters who come out onto the streets of Catalonia for the independence marches. If they all turn up at voting stations on November 9 and the ballot boxes are waiting for them, there will unlikely be enough police to stop them. Second, the economic arguments are a double-edged sword: yes, there would likely be huge economic chaos short term after any attempt at independence but, equally, if the Catalans try to walk away with 19% of Spanish GDP and 26% of exports right now, the weakened Spanish economy will tank, and that will create would cause a huge sucking sound in Europe, and then maybe globally. Thirdly, this is the 21st-Century, not the 19th-Century with horse charges and swords, or the 1930s with communists and fascists prepping for civil war. Supporters of Catalan independence like to say this will never be a violent revolution, so would Madrid ever have the balls to send police, soldiers and tanks to Barcelona to arrest people and stop it happening (which is what the legal threats ultimately imply)? Many Spanish conservatives also doubt Mr. Rajoy would have the guts to actually stop this taking place, despite him having lots of legal authority and actual power to try if he wants to (he could, in theory, order Mas and Junqueras arrested and suspend regional government altogether). That's what happened the last time the Catalans tried this, in 1934. Artillery pieces and machine guns were brought onto the streets of Barcelona, 46 people were killed and the Catalan First Minister, Companys, sentenced to 30 years in jail for rebellion. What is the feeling of separatists towards the Eurozone and the EU? They are very aware of the international community and the need to publicise their cause for the world to see. They make sure to publicise everything they do in English, so the international press and governments can read it. They do a big publicity stunt every year on Diada Day to emphasise the point (last year the 'human chain for independence'; this year a giant 'V' for 'votes and victory' in the centre of Barcelona). They see Europe and the international community as a way of legitimising their demands outside of the Spanish framework, and drive home the rhetorical point by arguing that "democracy and the voice of the people" is more important than constitutional law. They would also dearly like for a newly independent Catalonia to become a full member of the EU and the eurozone, despite European insistence that this is not going to happen (again, in reality, this point is probably up for negotiation if it all goes wrong).

Thomson ReutersA logo is pictured on the building of Cargill International SA in GenevaBy Tom Polansek CHICAGO (Reuters) - Cargill Inc's [CARG.UL] lawsuit against Syngenta AG  over rejections of genetically modified U.S. corn by China may be just the start of legal challenges against global seed makers over trade with one of the world's biggest markets. Trading giant Cargill said in court documents on Friday that it had lost more than $90 million because Syngenta sold Agrisure Viptera corn, known as MIR 162, to U.S. farmers without first obtaining import approval from China, which has turned away boatloads of U.S. crops containing the variety over the past year. The lawsuit will be a test case of who is ultimately responsible for such rejections that damage international trade: the seed companies that develop unapproved GMO traits or the merchants who sell grain that may be contaminated with it. "Let's face it, it's dollars and cents," Illinois farmer John Brink said about the motivation for seed companies that launch U.S. sales without approval from all major importers. "If they can get it out there a growing season earlier, it's more money in the pocket, more money for the company, more money for the shareholders." Cargill filed its case as U.S. farmers are preparing to harvest their first crop of another GMO variety of Syngenta corn called Duracade, which China has not approved for import. Nearly 90 percent of corn in the United States, the world's top grains producer, is now genetically engineered, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, as farmers embrace technology that helps kill weeds and fight pests. Approvals of the crops from importers are critical as the coming harvest is expected to be a record 14.395 billion bushels - outstripping domestic demand of 11.855 billion, which mostly goes to animal feed or ethanol production. China is one of many countries that is cautious about GMO crops. Some consumers worry about the safety of the crops for animal and human consumption, and there are concerns over their impact on the environment, including increased resistance of weeds. Farmers like Brink place the blame for China's rejection of U.S. corn containing Viptera squarely on Syngenta. And global grain trader Archer Daniels Midland Co  has said it too is considering legal action against the seed maker over the variety. Illinois-based ADM "has not yet made a formal decision on what actions it will take," spokeswoman Jackie Anderson told Reuters in an email. "Wide-scale planting of traits that aren't approved by key importing countries diminish the competitiveness of American grain and feed exports," she added. Bunge Ltd , another major grain trader, did not reply to a request for comment. Syngenta began selling corn seed containing MIR 162 to U.S. farmers in 2010 after winning approval from U.S. authorities. China has been considering an application to approve the variety for four years. Cargill said in its lawsuit that approval from China for imports "typically takes two to three years," while approval for cultivation can take longer. Syngenta had applied for both. Beijing began rejecting U.S. shipments of corn containing MIR 162 in November, costing the agriculture industry up to $2.9 billion, according to the National Grain and Feed Association.     RECKLESS CONTAMINATION? Cargill's claims that Syngenta recklessly contaminated the U.S. grain supply by selling MIR 162 without import approval from China are baseless, Syngenta spokesman Paul Minehart said in a statement. Syngenta "strongly upholds the right of growers to have access to approved new technologies that can increase both their productivity and their profitability," he said. Cargill itself took a risk by agreeing to sell U.S. corn to China, knowing the variety was in production, said a grain exporter for a rival company who asked not to be named. "Any time you do business with China, there's a risk," the trader said. "You try to make your trade with that in mind." "Cargill, like any grain trading company, saw a margin and a way to make money," he added. "They saw an opportunity and they went after it." Farmers and grain merchants need to keep MIR 162 corn separate from other varieties to prevent accidental shipment to unapproved markets. MIR 162 is approved for shipment to other major buyers of U.S. corn such as Japan and Mexico. Cargill has said it asked farmers to provide advance notice when they were delivering MIR 162 corn to its grain elevators. However, MIR 162 corn can still be found throughout the U.S. corn supply, effectively closing the lucrative Chinese market to U.S. supplies, according to the lawsuit. "Syngenta should have never even sold it until it was approved," said Caleb Hamer, a farmer in Black Hawk County, Iowa, who did not plant MIR 162 corn. "Asking us and then the end users to keep it segregated is a whole can of worms that nobody wants to deal with." For Duracade corn, Syngenta has teamed with grain merchant Gavilon, owned by Japanese trading house Marubeni Corp , to work with farmers to keep the GMO crop out of unapproved markets. The world's biggest traders, including Cargill and ADM, have said they will limit their handling of Duracade corn because China has not approved it. Dow AgroSciences, a unit of Dow Chemical Co , is awaiting U.S. approval to begin selling Enlist, yet another type of GMO corn that is not approved for import by China. Dow officials have said they may go ahead with commercialization in the United States even without Beijing's approval. Dow is "actively participating in industry-led initiatives, as well as directly engaging with the appropriate regulatory authorities to secure approvals in China," spokeswoman Kenda Resler Friend said.   Monsanto Co , the world's largest seed company and top developer of GMO crops, did not reply to questions about its crop commercialization policies. But Monsanto leaders have been actively working to curry Chinese favor for GMO crops. Exports of GMO crops, or crops that inadvertently contain traces of GMOs, have been a problem in the past. Many foreign buyers of alfalfa from the U.S. Pacific Northwest routinely test U.S. alfalfa supplies to make sure they do not contain GMOs. U.S. processors and exporters became hypersensitive to issues related to GMO corn after a variety unapproved for food use known as Starlink was discovered in a U.S. shipment to Japan in 2000. Sales to the biggest U.S. customers at the time — Japan and South Korea — dried up overnight. The subsequent tracing, sorting, testing, separating and certifying of GMO cost the industry millions of dollars.

Thomson ReutersFile photo of U.S. Treasury Secretary Lew testifying before Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee hearing in WashingtonWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has written to the Chinese government warning that a recent spate of antitrust investigations against foreign companies could have serious implications for U.S.-China relations, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday. The newspaper said Lew sent a letter to Chinese Vice Premier Wang Yang and said that China's recent focus on foreign companies could devalue foreign intellectual property, citing people briefed on the contents of the letter. The paper said the letter was sent in recent days. Representatives of the Chinese cabinet did not respond to requests for comment, the WSJ reported. The U.S. Treasury declined comment when asked to confirm the report. “We regularly correspond with our international counterparts on a variety of issues,” a Treasury official said earlier. At least 30 foreign firms, including U.S. companies such as Microsoft Corp and chip maker Qualcomm Inc have come under scrutiny as China seeks to enforce a 2008 anti-monopoly law that some critics say is being used to unfairly target foreign firms. REUTERS/StringerA visitor walks past a Microsoft booth at a computer software expo in Beijing, June 2, 2010. After July talks on the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue, Treasury said China "recognized that the objective of competition policy is to promote consumer welfare and economic efficiency, rather than to promote individual competitors or industries, and that enforcement of its competition law should be fair, objective, transparent, and non-discriminatory." In the last two weeks, four leading international business lobbies have raised alarm over the Chinese investigations. Their complaints range from worries that foreign companies are being unfairly targeted by probes motivated by China's industrial policy aims to concerns over the use of strong-arm tactics by Chinese regulators. But China's three anti-monopoly regulators said on Thursday they are not targeting multinational firms and the enforcement work is fair and transparent. China's Premier Li Keqiang has said that only 10 percent of companies impacted by anti-trust investigations are foreign. The Qualcomm case could yield record fines of more than $1 billion. Regulators have also announced their first-ever punishments of foreign carmakers for price-fixing, fining a Chinese venture of Volkswagen AG and the China sales unit of Fiat's Chrysler a combined $46 million.

Wikipedia CommonsHave you ever wondered what the economy looked like in the year 1 AD? Deutsche Bank released a note that included a chart of major global economies in the first year of the common era. They're ranked by "economic power,"  which is measured in terms of economic output compared to the total world output. Unsurprisingly, Augustus' Roman Empire ranked first. It controlled slightly over 25% of total world output. Rome's largest competitors, Parthia (whose modern territory is roughly modern day Iran) and Germany controlled only 2% and 1%, respectively, of the global economic output. Deutsche Bank's note added that, "whilst economic output is not the only important variable in understanding the ability of a nation or empire to exert global power, it is probably the most important basic element as it determines the total pool of resources that can be devoted to war." Deutsche Bank "Here the 'world' is defined as the empire's contemporaries would have thought of it — as Western Europe, North Africa and the Middle East," noted Reid. As you can see from the chart, certain empires such as China under the Han Dynasty are excluded. FREE AppDownload
Deutsche BankDeutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid and his team just released a huge 104-page study that focuses on answering one question: Are bonds in a bubble? The answer: well, probably.  Reid writes: It has long been our view that over the last couple of decades the global economy has rolled from bubble to bubble with excesses never fully being allowed to unravel. Instead aggressive policy responses have encouraged them to roll into new bubbles.  This has arguably kept the modern financial system as we know it a going concern. Clearly there have always been bubbles formed through history but has there been a period like the last 20 years where the bursting of one bubble has consistently led directly to the formation of the next? It's an amazing statement — that the modern financial system doesn't just experience bubbles, but in fact needs them. You could say this makes bubbles a feature, not a bug, of the financial system (which is something many people say already). And the latest bubble appears to have rolled into bonds, with yields tumbling around the world and government debt in Europe currently at half-millennia lows. What we found was that bonds are where the bubble has migrated to. This is not to say that the bond market bubble is about the burst — far from it — but that it is a necessary condition for maintaining the debt ladened financial system that has been the by-product of major crisis management over the last two decades. The worry is that there is nowhere left for this bubble to go given that it is now in the hands of the lenders of last resort (governments and central banks with regulators ensuring other large captive buyers). Although we think this bubble needs to be maintained to ensure the solvency of the current financial system, the best case scenario is that it slowly pops over time via negative real returns for bondholders. The worst case scenario being future restructuring. This figure from Deutsche Bank gives a snapshot of government bond yields around the world. Everything is low. Deutsche Bank But looking simply at low yields doesn't provide enough evidence to say whether the current environment is a bubble. Reid says we also need to look at inflation, because if we're in an environment in which inflation remains, "structurally lower for an extended period it might help justify lower bond yields." Looking deep into history, Reid examines inflation dynamics dated from both 1210 and then from 1800, and he finds that the modern world has generally seen positive inflation as monetary systems became less tied to precious metals. Reid writes that "the longer-term investor has evidence that we live in a world with a positive inflation bias and as such must approach the current low levels of bond yields with extreme caution." Here are the two long-dated charts of inflation. Deutsche Bank But whether you think bonds are in a bubble also depends on what you believe the future holds for the world economy. Reid writes that secular stagnation, the idea popularized last year by Larry Summers that the global economy is facing a new low-growth reality, may support a future of low-inflation, low-growth and consequently, low bond yields. In his speech at the IMF last year, Summers argued that the economy was showing signs that the natural interest rate, or the rate at which investment and savings result in full employment, may now be negative. Given its recent actions, the ECB appears to be testing this theory. And while Reid writes that he's a believer in the idea that the economy is experiencing something like secular stagnation, he says bonds have priced in this possibility to a large degree. Additionally, Reid writes that it isn't clear that the long-term consequences of a secular stagnation environment don't include inflation and debt restructuring. Reid writes: "The longer we live in a weak growth world, the more debt is likely to be built up as fiscal targets are missed and the more difficult it will be to see a way of Governments returning investors’ money back in real adjusted." So even if we are experiencing secular stagnation, even over the long-term, the risk-reward proposition of buying bonds at current prices might not be worth it.  FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Vincent WestA damaged washing machine — though not one of the ones in questionSEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  has accused the head of rival LG Electronics Inc's  home appliances business of damaging Samsung washing machines at retail stores in Germany and asked Seoul prosecutors to investigate. Samsung, in a statement on Sunday, said it asked the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office to investigate LG employees who the company says were seen deliberately destroying several of its premium washing machines on display at two stores earlier this month ahead of the IFA electronics show in Berlin. "It is very unfortunate that Samsung had to request that a high-ranking executive be investigated by the nation's legal authorities, but this was inevitable, as we concluded that we had to get to the bottom of this incident," Samsung said. LG denied Samsung's claim and said the executives inadvertently damaged the doors of two washing machines in one store because the model in question had weak hinges. An LG spokeswoman told Reuters that Jo Seong-jin, head of the company's home appliances division, was one of the people named in Samsung's investigation request. Officials in the prosecutors' office could not be reached on Sunday. The dispute is the latest between the two South Korean arch-rivals, which compete across a wide range of products including smartphones, televisions and home appliances. Previous disputes included a conflict over refrigerator capacity and claims over South Korean air conditioner market share. LG says that it is the world's largest maker of washing machines, followed by Samsung. German police had questioned LG officials following the incident, LG said. Both companies showed off competing gadgets and home appliances during the IFA trade show. LG said the incidents occurred as the executives had sought to examine products made by Samsung and other rivals. It said its employees agreed to pay for four damaged Samsung washing machines at one store in accordance with mediation efforts by German police, though it says it was only responsible for two of the damaged products. "We hope that this is not an attempt to damage our reputation," LG said in a statement, adding that it will cooperate with prosecutors on the investigation.

Thomson ReutersA plastic container with empty bottles of Heineken beers are pictured among beer kegs outside a restaurant in SingaporeLONDON/AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Global brewer SABMiller has made a takeover approach to the family owners of Heineken that has been rejected, Bloomberg reported on Sunday, citing people with knowledge of the matter. The newswire said SABMiller's approach was made as part of a strategy to protect itself from any potential bid from SAB's larger rival, world No.1 brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev. A tie-up between SABMiller, which has a market capitalization of 55 billion pounds ($90 billion), and Heineken, with a market capitalization of 34 billion euros ($44 billion), would combine the world's second- and third-largest brewers. SAB and Heinken both declined to comment on the matter. Any potential takeover of Heineken would need the approval of the founding family, which controls the brewer via holding vehicle Heineken Holding. Bloomberg reported from its sources that the offer would have made the Heineken family one of the largest shareholders in the combined group. The newswire also said that the approach was made in the last two weeks. SAB, the maker of Miller Lite, Peroni and Grolsch beers is struggling to grow in Europe and North America. New revenues from emerging middle-classes in developing markets have been dented by weak currencies in many of those countries of late. Heineken, the largest player in mature western Europe, has steadily expanded in faster-growing emerging markets, including Mexico and in Asia. From an antitrust point of view, there would be considerable areas of overlap between the two, including in the Netherlands, parts of Africa and Latin America as well as Vietnam and India.

At 2.61%, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note is at its highest level since July. But it's still extremely low. Folks like hedge fund manager David Tepper believe that yields are heading higher from here. But according to Deutsche Bank's Torsten Slok, there are actually more forces pushing U.S. interest rates down than up. Here's a roundup for the forces from Slok: Deutsche Bank FREE AppDownload

Thomson ReutersA worker is seen inside an office of Portuguese bank BES in LisbonBy Andrei Khalip LISBON (Reuters) - The Bank of Portugal on Sunday picked a new chief executive for Novo Banco, successor to Banco Espirito Santo (BES), following the embarrassing resignation of its three top managers appointed only two months ago. Eduardo Stock da Cunha, 51, an experienced international banker who has worked at lenders like Santander and Lloyds in Britain, Portugal, Spain and the United States, became the new head of the bank that the central bank aims to sell off swiftly to recover state loans. BES, Portugal's largest listed lender, had to be rescued last month after the collapse of the business empire of its founding Espirito Santo family, whose main holding firms are under creditor protection. Stock da Cunha's last job was as auditing and risk area director on the team of Lloyds Banking Group's Portuguese CEO Antonio Horta Osorio. The two had worked previously at Santander in Portugal. Jorge Cardoso, board member at the state-owned bank Caixa Geral de Depositos, was named finance director at Novo Banco, Bank of Portugal said in a statement. The central bank also reiterated its intention to sell the bank to investors "within the shortest reasonable period" to guarantee a stable ownership structure and safeguard the interests of Novo Banco clients. On Saturday, Chief Executive Vitor Bento, finance director Joao Moreira Rato and deputy CEO Jose Honorio - all handpicked by the Bank of Portugal in July - said they were leaving because their initial mandate to revive the bank with private money had changed too much since the government bailout. Weekly newspaper Expresso said on Saturday the executives had objected to the central bank's plan to sell Novo Banco as soon as possible to recover the 3.9 billion euros ($5.1 billion) in public funds used in the rescue. The three men denied any conflict, but said that since the procedure for a swift sale had been launched and was being managed by the central bank, they felt "that the right thing to do is to hand over the reins to another management team". Bento's initial mandate was to save BES using private capital. The central bank then decided on Aug. 3 to step in with 4.9 billion euros, some of which was provided by Portugal's bank resolution fund, to recapitalize the "good bank" Novo Banco that it carved out of the troubled BES. Bento, a respected economist and business manager, was picked by Bank of Portugal Governor Carlos Costa in July to replace Ricardo Salgado, the patriarch of the Espirito Santo family that founded the bank some 150 years ago. Salgado had resigned under pressure from Costa. Bento's management team and the Bank of Portugal have said they suspect illegal activity took place at BES, involving the financing of the troubled family businesses using money borrowed from BES clients.

The FOMC will meet on Tuesday and Wednesday. The FOMC statement will be released Wednesday at 2:00 PM ET.  Fed Chair Janet Yellen will hold a press conference at 2:30 PM.What will know for this meeting:• The FOMC will not raise rates. D'oh!• The FOMC will reduce asset purchases (aka QE3) by $10 billion to $15 billion for the month of October. Note: the FOMC is expected to end QE3 at the October 29th meeting, so the October purchases are likely the final $15 billion for QE3.• During the press conference, Dr. Yellen will break into a happy dance when asked about her comment in June that inflation data was "noisy". In June she said:  "I think recent readings on CPI index have been a bit on the high side but I think the data we're seeing is noisy. Broadly speaking inflation is evolving in line with the committee's expectations." OK, no dance, but Yellen was correct.What we don't know for this meeting:• What changes the FOMC will make to the statement. Here is the July statement.  It is possible the sentence about not raising rates for a "considerable time" after the end of QE3 will be modified or removed. Here is the sentence:  "The Committee continues to anticipate, based on its assessment of these factors, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored." Obviously this sentence will have to be changed soon, since the asset purchase program is expected to end next month.• Will the FOMC or Dr. Yellen indicate the first rate hike might happen before mid-year 2015? In March, Yellen said:  My guess is Yellen will clearly state the first rate hike will not happen for some time, and that the rate hike will be data dependent.It will also be interesting to see the changes to the FOMC projections.  For review, here are the previous projections.   GDP bounced back sharply in Q2, and is looking solid in Q3, but Q1 was very weak.  It is possible GDP projections for 2014 will be increased slightly. 1 Projections of change in real GDP and inflation are from the fourth quarter of the previous year to the fourth quarter of the year indicated. The unemployment rate was at 6.1% in August, so the unemployment rate projection for Q4 2014 will probably be lowered slightly.   2 Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated. As of July, PCE inflation was up 1.6% from July 2013, and core inflation was up 1.5%.   Both PCE and core PCE inflation projections will probably be unchanged and will still be below the FOMC's 2% target.   Here are the FOMC's recent core inflation projections:   FREE AppDownload
AFPYahoo CEO Marissa MayerChina's Alibaba will star on Wall Street with its upcoming stock offering, but US-based Yahoo also gets a windfall, which may help the turnaround efforts of the fading Internet pioneer. Yahoo, which bought a 40 percent stake in the Chinese online giant in 2005 for $1 billion, still holds 22.4 percent of Alibaba. And the California company is expected to walk away with $7 billion to $9 billion by paring that stake down to 16.3 percent. The huge public offering for Alibaba comes with Yahoo seeking a new direction under chief executive Marissa Mayer, who took the reins in 2012 in an effort to redefine the company's mission after it took a back seat to Google and others. Analysts say the cash offers Yahoo an opportunity, but that it needs to use it productively. "Alibaba is giving rocket fuel to Yahoo, but the problem is Yahoo still has to develop the engines," said Trip Chowdhry at Global Equities Research. Yahoo said in July the majority of the proceeds of the sale of Yahoo's stake would be returned to shareholders. The remainder could help fuel acquisitions to help Yahoo rev up its sagging revenue base, after a four percent year-on-year drop in the latest quarter. Mayer has been on a buying spree, which has included the blogging platform Tumblr last year for $1.1 billion as part of an effort to draw in younger Internet users. Chowdhry said Yahoo should also use some of the cash to "innovate" and improve some of its existing services, such as Yahoo Mail and Yahoo Finance, and Web hosting and services for small business. But it is unclear if Yahoo will be able to wow its users and investors with products and services like others in the sector such as Apple or Google. Mayer has been moving Yahoo toward more online video, with plans to produce its own entertainment programs to go along with news and music, but has not been able to challenge Google-owned YouTube. In addition to winning over consumers, Yahoo must restore confidence in its investors. Yahoo's market value has nearly tripled in the past two years to some $42.6 billion -- but analysts point out that much of that value is from its investment in Alibaba, worth between $31 and $34.6 billion. Some investors may have used Yahoo as a proxy for Alibaba and now might cash out. "I wonder if investors will sell Yahoo to buy Alibaba directly," said Gregori Volokhine at Meeschaert Financial Services. "Or will they keep their Yahoo shares to benefit from any appreciation or Alibaba? It's not clear." Another possibility being talked about is Alibaba -- whose market value could be as much as $200 billion -- simply swallowing up Yahoo, if the US firm fails to return to growth. Yahoo rejected a takeover a few years ago from Microsoft, but since then its fortunes have sagged and it has fallen behind rivals in key areas such as online advertising. Alibaba could invest a lot of cash in Yahoo and could use it as a way to enter the difficult US market. And its IPO is expected to raise a record amount, possibly as much as $24 billion. Chowdhry said it's unlikely that Yahoo would be sold to a Chinese firm because of "the perception that there is a lot of censorship and government control on Internet companies in China." "I don't think the (US) regulatory agencies will allow Alibaba to acquire Yahoo," he said. Copyright (2014) AFP. All rights reserved.  FREE AppDownload

The geographic distribution of income and wealth in the U.S. is always a fascinating topic.  One of the many types of geography the Census Bureau tabulates figures for are "places." These are either legally incorporated cities or towns or Census-designated statistical equivalents. In this map, we consider places with at least 1,000 residents, according to the 2008-2012 American Community Survey. Using income estimates from the ACS, we found the place with the highest median household income in each state. The map shows where the affluent towns are, and the median income in each: Business Insider/Andy Kiersz, data from 2008-2012 American Community Survey Many of the affluent communities are wealthy suburbs of major cities such as Scarsdale, New York, and Darien, Connecticut, outside of New York City, and Chevy Chase, Maryland, and Great Falls, Virginia, near Washington, D.C. They all tend to be fairly small with populations ranging from about 1,000 (our chosen lower cutoff) to about 18,000. Here's a table with the 50 towns and their median incomes: Business Insider/Andy Kiersz, data from 2008-2012 American Community Survey

The EconomistA FEW MONTHS ago Progressive, an insurance company, ran a video ad on Facebook featuring a grown man who acts like a baby and is carried around in a sling. The ad urged youngsters to "act your age" by renouncing their parents' car insurance and buying their own.  When Facebook employees chuckled about it during a meeting, David Fischer, the firm's 41-year-old head of marketing, wondered why he had never seen it. He was too old, his colleagues said. Progressive was trying to appeal to young drivers, so it served up the ad only to them. In 1963 David Ogilvy, the father of Madison Avenue and author of a classic business book, "Confessions of an Advertising Man", wrote: "An advertisement is like a radar sweep, constantly hunting new prospects as they come into the market. Get a good radar, and keep it sweeping." Half a century later advertisers are at last taking him at his word. Behavioural profiling has gone viral across the internet, enabling firms to reach users with specific messages based on their location, interests, browsing history and demographic group. Ads can now follow users from site to site: a customer who looks online for flights to Frankfurt will be inundated with German holiday offers. Conversant, a digital-marketing firm, uses an algorithm to deliver around 800,000 variations of an ad to its big clients' prospective customers to make it as irresistible as possible. Kraft, a food company, monitors online opinions on its brands in an office which it calls "the looking glass". Extreme personalisation in advertising has been slow to come, except in search advertising, where Google, Yahoo and other engines have been serving up ads tailored to users' interests for years. But now it has arrived in earnest. According to one poll by Adobe, a software company, most marketers say they have seen more change in the past two years than in the previous 50. In the classic advertising model, firms used to place ads with media that brought together the audiences they were after. They would go for business executives in the Wall Street Journal, for example, or youngsters on MTV. But now advertisers no longer have to rely on media as proxies for consumers, because they have more tools and data to target precisely the people they want to reach. The world wide web turned 25 in March, and the first banner ad on it ran 20 years ago, but until a few years ago advertising on the internet did not add up to much. That has changed. Last year online advertising made up about a quarter of the $500 billion global advertising business, and it is rising fast. Some of the 21st century's most powerful companies, including Google, emerged on the back of it. Companies that used to flourish in pre-digital advertising have struggled to keep up. "Media used to be based on scarce distribution," says Dave Morgan, an internet veteran and the boss of Simulmedia, a television-advertising company. By contrast, online advertising space is unlimited and prices are low, so making money is not as easy as it was in the offline world, even for digital natives such as Yahoo. The Economist All the same, new entrants continue to join the fray, enticed by the big opportunities they see as well as by the falling cost of starting digital-media businesses. According to eMarketer, a research firm, Americans spend over 12 hours a day consuming media (sometimes concurrently), and digital media account for around half of that total. Digital advertising is being buoyed by three important trends. The first is the rise of mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, which began when Apple introduced the iPhone in 2007. Now more than 1.7 billion people (around 20% of the world's population) use smartphones. Mobile devices, which are intimately connected to their owners, have changed the way in which people travel the internet. Users now prefer apps (self-contained programmes on smartphones) to websites' home pages, and in America they are spending less time on desktop computers. "It took 150 years for the newspaper industry to contract," says Meredith Kopit Levien, head of advertising for the New York Times. "The desktop industry will contract because of mobile in a tenth of that time." The second, related trend is the rise of social networks such as Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest, which have become an important navigation system for people looking for content across the web. "The convergence of social and mobile has given an addressable audience online that's 100 times bigger than ever before," says Jonah Peretti, the founder of BuzzFeed, an online news and entertainment site. Social networks hold rich data about their users, who volunteer lots of information about themselves. Facebook and Twitter can also see where else people go online, which can help them sell their users' attention to advertisers. The third big development has been the rise of real-time bidding, or "programmatic buying", a new system for targeting consumers precisely and swiftly with online adverts. Publishers, advertisers and intermediaries can now bid for digital ads electronically and direct them to specific consumers at lightning speed. Jonathan Nelson of Omnicom Group, a large advertising company, says his firm has the chance to bid for around 10m online advertising "impressions" (ads seen by a user) every second. Real-time bidding will spread further as more screens, such as televisions and billboards, become connected to the internet. The lines between established media businesses are becoming blurred. Richard Edelman, the boss of Edelman, a public-relations firm, describes the media and advertising business as a "mosh pit". Media companies are producing more content on behalf of advertisers, dubbed "native advertising". At the same time some advertisers have taken to hiring their own journalists to produce stories, websites and videos. The new advertising-technology (ad-tech) industry is making inroads into the business of traditional advertising agencies. Publicis, a big advertising group, is becoming "much more an internet company than an advertising group", says its boss, Maurice Lévy. screenshot/The Economist Jeff Goodby, the boss of Goodby Silverstein &amp; Partners, an advertising agency, finds that clients' biggest question is whether people will even notice their ads. Consumers are dividing their time among many screens, and ever fewer of them are watching TV programmes live. Even so, television advertising has kept its dominance for now because it is one of the few ways to reach a wide audience, especially during live shows and sporting events. But advertisers worry that they could fragment their brands by having to come up with lots of different ads to reach consumers across many media, says Keith Weed, chief marketing officer of Unilever, the world's second-largest advertiser. This special report will show that technology is profoundly changing the dynamics of advertising. Building on the vast amount of data produced by consumers' digital lives, it is giving more power to media companies that have a direct relationship with their customers and can track them across different devices. An entire industry has sprung up around targeted ads. Third-party tracking companies gather information on browsing habits and online purchases, often invisibly. "A site is not one company any more. A site is tens of hundreds of companies all knowing where you are and what you're looking at," says Chris Babel of TRUSTe, a firm that provides privacy services. Nikesh Arora, formerly chief business officer at Google and now vice-chairman of Softbank, a Japanese media company, says a race is on to have the best data and become the "intelligence broker". Consumers may gain from advertising tailored to their particular needs, and so far most of them seem content to accept the ensuing loss of privacy. But companies are sensitive to the potential costs of overstepping the mark. As the head of one British advertising firm puts it: "Once people realise what's happening, I can't imagine there won't be pushback."  Click here to subscribe to The Economist       FREE AppDownload
Nick Tininenko / Stringer / Getty ImagesThey seem happy ... but how are their bank accounts?Every three years, the Federal Reserve Board releases its Survey of Consumer Finances, and the latest version was presented in September. As Business Insider's Elena Holodny points out, the data shows the highest earners in the United States "bouncing back nicely" after the recession, contributing to a growing wealth gap. What else does the Fed say? You can see the data, watch a video about its findings ... or scroll down for the video highlights. The video first examines household income, a key measure of economic well-being. The fact that mean income is above median income every year, the Fed points out, reflects the disproportionate amount of wealth at the top of the income spectrum. Federal Reserve Board The wealth gap is also illustrated by this data, which shows mean income growing faster than median income for 14 years, from a 60% difference between the two measures in 1989 to a 90% difference in 2013.  The fact that mean income dropped faster than median income between 2007 and 2010 shows the exaggerated impact of the recession on the country's wealthiest. Federal Reserve Board The report segments earners into three income groups, with mean income ranging from $27,000 to $397,500 between the lowest and highest income groups — over 14 times as much. The 2014 poverty line is $23,850 for a family of four. Federal Reserve Board Between 2007 and 2010, mean income declined for all three of the income groups illustrated above. Between 2010 and 2013, however, income increased for the highest group, while decreasing for the lowest and staying about the same for the group in the middle.  In 2013, the video says, every income group had a lower mean income than in 2007. Federal Reserve Board The report also used wealth to measure economic well-being. Below is the mean wealth for all three cohorts. Federal Reserve Board Like income, mean wealth has been consistently higher than median wealth, reflecting that same disproportionate distribution. Again, the gap has only gotten wider in past years. Federal Reserve Board Between 2007 and 2010, mean wealth among all three groups declined. Between 2010 and 2013, however, wealth declined only in the lowest income group. Both the middle and highest income groups showed an increase in mean wealth. Federal Reserve Board The third measure listed in the report is homeownership, which declined among all three groups between 2007 and 2010. Between 2010 and 2013, though, only the highest income group saw an increase in homeownership.  Federal Reserve Board Mean net housing wealth (the value of housing minus any related debts) has declined among all three groups between 2007 and 2013.  The sharp drop between 2007 and 2010 in particular is credited to a decline in average house prices, along with a reduction of mortgages and other housing debts.  Federal Reserve Board The report then turns its attention to education borrowing, singling out families whose heads are younger than 40. Between 2001 and 2013, the mean value of education loans increased from $16,900 to $29,00, and the median from $10,500 to $16,800. Federal Reserve Board You can see in the pie charts below that while the majority of families still owe less than $25,000 in education debt, more families have taken on larger amounts of debt in 2013 than in 2001. Debt burdens between $50,000 and $100,000 more than doubled in those 12 years, and debt of over $100,000 went from 1% to 6%. Federal Reserve Board Finally, the report examines the distribution of education debt among income levels, finding that families with an income below $30,000 doubled between 2001 and 2013, making up about a quarter of total education debt.  The decline in debt among the middle income group means that the highest income group, earning over $60,000, still holds about half the total debt.

REUTERS/Stephen Lam Apple CEO Tim Cook greets the audience during an Apple event announcing the iPhone 6 and the Apple Watch at the Flint Center in Cupertino, California, September 9, 2014. APPLE prides itself on constantly re-imagining the future, but even the world's leading gadget-maker likes to dwell on the past too. Thirty years ago Steve Jobs commanded the stage at the Flint Centre for the Performing Arts near Apple's headquarters in Cupertino to show off the new Macintosh computer. On September 9th Mr Jobs's successor, Tim Cook, held a similar performance in the same location to thunderous applause. Those invited were given a chance to play with the gadgets presented on stage: two new iPhones and a wearable device, called the Apple Watch. "This is the next chapter in Apple's story," he said, sounding much like the young Mr Jobs in 1984. It may well be true--but not for the reasons most people might think. Consumers, analysts and investors have been howling for proof that Apple can still do the magic tricks of the Jobs era; iPad sales have weakened in recent quarters and the iPhone, launched a tech aeon ago in 2007, still generates more than half of the firm's revenues. Yet lost in the maelstrom of snazzy new gadgets, applause and photos was an important shift: this week's announcements showed that Apple's future will be less about hardware and more about its "ecosystem"--a combination of software, services, data and a plethora of partners. If Apple were simply a hardware-maker, there would be reason to worry. It is losing market share to rivals such as Samsung of South Korea and Xiaomi of China, which make cheaper devices, and to Google's Android operating system, which runs on 71% of the world's smartphones. Apple's average selling price is $609, compared with $249 for smartphones worldwide, according to IDC, a market-research firm. That is good for profits, but it makes Apple increasingly a niche player, somewhat like a luxury-goods firm, says Colin Gillis of BGC, a stockbroker. As with Apple's existing products, much effort went into the watch's design. Its backplate contains sensors that measure the user's vital signs; and people can send their heartbeat to other watch-wearers--as a new sort of expressive message. But starting at $349, and only usable in conjunction with an iPhone, it looks unlikely to be a serious competitor to other expensive watches (see "Swiss watches and the Apple Watch: It's not about time"). The EconomistStill, many are likely to stick with their iPhones and even plunk down the money for an Apple Watch, because of the firm's ecosystem. Apple is considered a laggard in online offerings, especially since it bungled the launch of its map service. Its services and apps can be maddening. But iTunes, Apple's media store, now boasts more than 800m active users, three times as many as Amazon's. Apple's software and services category, which includes iTunes, its Apps Store, revenue from warranties and other businesses, brought in sales of more than $16 billion in 2013 and is growing steadily (see chart). Apple's watch is supposed to help the firm expand into new areas. One example is a mobile wallet. It aims to replace swiping credit cards with the tap of an Apple watch (or an iPhone) on a device connected to a retailer's cash register. Apple's new health and fitness applications help people monitor their workouts. The firm's new operating systems, due out soon, will allow its devices to work together seamlessly: an e-mail started on an iPhone can be finished on an iMac. For Ben Wood of CCS Insight, another market-research firm, Apple's plan is to be even more like the Hotel California (as in the Eagles' song), "where you can check out any time you like, but you can never leave". The more Apple-gadget owners store their data in them, from photos to health information, the more they are locked in, and must stick with Apple. At the same time, Apple is trying to become more open to partners--a big change for the firm. "There has always been a huge tension between keeping control and opening up" at Apple, explains Michael Cusumano of MIT's Sloan School of Management. Mr Jobs saw Apple products as complete works of art and never wanted them unbundled. Only after the executive team rebelled, for instance, did he relent and in 2003 let iTunes become available on Windows--a move that dramatically increased sales of the iPod. Three years after Mr Jobs's death, Apple seems to be ready to go further, hoping to entice other firms to contribute to its ecosystem and make it more attractive. Earlier this year Apple announced a partnership with IBM, as well as changes that make it easier for outside developers to design apps for the iPhone. And Apple's watch will have third-party apps from the start. The iPhone launched without the app store; it opened only a year later, after many outside developers had hacked the device, allowing them to write apps for it. The new openness does not only apply to technology. Mr Cook has let outsiders join his inner circle, hiring executives from retail and other industries to expand Apple's expertise. He has also overseen the largest acquisition in Apple's history, the $3 billion purchase in May of Beats, a headphones and music-streaming company. For its new payment system it teamed up with big retailers, such as Whole Foods and Walgreens, and credit-card firms, including MasterCard and Visa. REUTERS/Stephen LamEddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of Internet Software and Service, introduces Apple Pay. This opening-up may need to go further, to keep up with Google's ecosystem. The internet giant's services still beat Apple's. And it not only lets device-makers modify Android, but also gives it away (albeit with conditions, such as the requirement to carry Google's services). "Apple v Android" could still end up a repeat of "Apple v Windows": in personal computers Apple lost the battle against Microsoft because it refused to license its operating system to other hardware-makers. Umberto Eco, an Italian novelist, once compared Apple's platform to Catholicism and Microsoft's to Protestantism. The Macintosh, he wrote, "tells the faithful how they must proceed, step by step". By contrast, Windows "allows free interpretation of scripture...and takes for granted the idea that not all can achieve salvation." This still rings true today, but Apple is clearly going through a Reformation. Click here to subscribe to The Economist FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Sergei KarpukhinNew U.S. sanctions handed down on Friday are designed to effectively "shut off" Russian oil conglomerates from oil exploration projects, U.S. officials said, in a move aimed squarely at Russia's $425 billion-a-year petroleum industry. The measures are "designed to effectively shut down this type of oil exploration and production activity by depriving these Russian companies of the goods, technology, and services that they need to do this work," a senior Obama administration official said Friday.  The official added the intention of the new sanctions was to ensure that "we have effectively shut off the capacity" of Russian oil companies to draw on U.S. expertise for deepwater, Arctic offshore, and/or shale oil exploration projects. The official stressed this was an important step because Russia's companies did not possess the kind of technology needed to undertake the operations. The new sanctions prohibit U.S. companies from exporting goods, services, or technology to support five Russian energy companies in exploration or production for Russian deepwater, Arctic offshore, or shale projects that have the potential to produce oil. The U.S. Treasury Department said companies have until Sept. 26 to wind down existing transactions affected by the new sanctions. The Russian energy companies hit by the sanctions include Gazprom, Gazprom Neft, Lukoil, Surgutneftegas, and Rosneft. European companies will have similar prohibitions, under mirroring sanctions handed down by the European Union.  Mark Dubowitz, the executive director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and an expert on previous sanctions leveled against countries like Iran, told Business Insider it was a smart escalation in sanctions.  "The new sanctions are smart and targeted and will impact Russia's access to Western technology and services that are needed to develop Moscow's medium to long-term oil exploration and production capacity," Dubowitz said.  "There will be winners and losers, including companies like Exxon and BP, but Western companies will adjust as they have to past energy sanctions against countries like Iran, Iraq, Sudan, and others. The real pain will be borne by Moscow, for whom energy is their economic lifeblood." REUTERS/Jessica RinaldiExxon could be a big loser of the new sanctions. Indeed, Exxon could be set to take a hit from the sanctions. In 2011, it agreed to a $500 billion joint venture to explore for oil in the Russian portion of the Arctic Ocean. And the new sanctions come just weeks after Exxon and Rosneft began drilling in Russia’s Kara Sea. "We are assessing the sanctions. It is our policy to comply with all laws," Alan Jeffers, a spokesman for Exxon, told Business Insider in an email.  London-based BP, meanwhile, holds a near-20% stake in Rosneft, which is the largest direct foreign investment in Russia.  The new sanctions are designed to further punish the Russian economy in an attempt to change the calculus of Russian President Vladimir Putin with respect to the situation in Ukraine. U.S. officials painted the targeting of Russia's oil industry as a significant escalatory step, because each of the companies has either direct or close ties to the Kremlin.  For the West — and Europe especially — the move is risky, because it could ignite retaliatory measures from a government that provides a steady stream of natural gas across the continent. U.S. President Barack Obama said Thursday that the sanctions were being imposed in response to Russia's "actions to further destabilize Ukraine over the last month," including an incursion of at least 1,000 Russian forces into eastern Ukraine to fight with pro-Russian separatists in eastern regions of the country. Obama also said a cease-fire reached last week has not produced "conclusive evidence" Russia has worked to de-escalate the crisis.

Postdlf, Wikimedia Commons Excluding the hardcore pro-independence people, almost everyone seems to believe that an independent Scotland would be an economic disaster. There are various reasons why Scotland would find itself economically disadvantaged. For one thing, it is likely it would see significant capital flight, as banks and other institutions took money out of Scotland, and brought it to the UK. There would also be a currency problem. If Scotland keeps the pound — as the YES campaign claims to want — it would no longer have control over its monetary policy and could face a fiscal crisis. As an alternative, a Scottish currency would likely be very weak. A new note from David Folkerts-Landau, group chief economist at Deutsche Bank, argues that Scottish independence would be an all-time great blunder. Everyone has the right to self determination and to exercise his or her democratic rights. But there are times when fundamental political decisions have negative consequences far beyond what voters and politicians could have imagined. We feel that we are the threshold of one such moment. A "Yes" vote for Scottish independence on Thursday would go down in history as a political and economic mistake as large as Winston Churchill's decision in 1925 to return the pound to the Gold Standard or the failure of the Federal Reserve to provide sufficient liquidity to the US banking system, which we now know brought on the Great Depression in the US. These decisions – well-intentioned as they were – contributed to years of depression and suffering and could have been avoided had alternative decisions been taken. The essential argument is that Scotland leaving the UK would be something akin to a eurozone country being forced to leave during the eurozone crisis. Just the threat of that would lead to surging interest rates, higher taxes, and lower public spending. Folkerts-Landau argues that it would take years for an independent Scotland to rebuild what's been built economically by the UK: The economic and financial policy making institutions of Whitehall, as imperfect as they may be, have nevertheless created stability and certainty for private economic decision makers. Scottish consumers and investors have benefitted from the credibility of the Bank of England's monetary policy, financial institutions and their clients have benefitted from an equally credible supervisory and regulatory regime, while foreign investors come to Scotland because they rely on a predictable investment environment. All of this comes from a united Great Britain. A Scotland on its own would not automatically inherit these hard-wrought characteristics of a democratic market environment. Until such time as Scotland has demonstrated a tried and tested ability to govern and administer a modern economy there would be doubts. Residents in Scotland would move their assets to England-based institutions for fear of a forced conversion to a new weaker currency. Financial institutions would move under the umbrella of the Bank of England, investors would, at a minimum, require a higher return of their investments in Scotland to compensate for the increased risk. The note concludes by touching on geopolitics and pointing out that in the current day and age, it's "incomprehensible" why a the choice would be made to leave one of the most powerful, wealthiest countries in the world.

Thomson ReutersSimo Puhakka, Chief Executive Officer at Pohjola Asset Management Execution Services poses for a photograph in central LondonLONDON (Reuters) - Stock investors who recognize the risks of trading in anonymous "dark pools" but are unwilling to spurn them have found an alternative: club together. A growing number of European investment funds have signed up to use an electronic trading system designed by one of their own - Finland's Pohjola Asset Management - which offers the ability to dissect and control the way their market bets are routed to dark pools and other exchanges across the region. The data they generate is shared among the group, giving them strength in numbers but also leeway to change strategies. This might seem like little more than back-office tinkering to the uninitiated - after all, fund managers are paid to decide which stocks to buy, not the minutiae of where to trade them. That job is usually left to brokers and banks, which often run their own dark pools while also offering access to rival venues. But investors want more control and transparency over the trading process, fearing the post-crisis proliferation of opaque private markets and high-speed electronic traders has exposed them to new risks that can rack up costly losses. These risks include a lack of disclosure about how some venues operate and price trades, as well as the danger that some give an unseen advantage to high-frequency traders. "For many years, investment banks and other electronic brokers have provided electronic order-routing mechanisms ... But once an order goes behind a firewall it's very difficult to maintain total control over it," said Adam Conn, head of trading at Barings Asset Management, a user of the Pohjola router. "There is a growing empowerment within the buy side (investors) and that's a healthy development." Enforcement actions against global banks that run dark pools have raised awareness of potential conflicts of interest. The UK's FCA markets watchdog warned in July that "many" banks and brokers were failing to put their clients' interests first when executing trades. The implicit trading costs these risks represent may be just fractions of a percentage point on each trade, but for a fund turning over a $5 billion portfolio they could represent losses well into the millions. This is the kind of "slippage cost" Pohjola says it helps save.   NO CONFLICTS Rather than try to outgun rivals with souped-up algorithms, Pohjola's system aims to reduce conflicts of interest by putting fund managers - not brokers - in charge of where to send trades. By comparing notes on each venue's performance, Pohjola and its clients make tweaks accordingly. Designed by a team led by former Pohjola head trader Simo Puhakka, as well as ex-broker David Berney and electronic-trade specialist Keith Wright, the router is pitched as a bias-free and transparent alternative to putting trades in the hands of a broker who may have financial incentives to use certain venues. "You can't rely on or trust solely what your broker delivers," said Puhakka in an interview. "We realized we should create a better solution, a better smart order router." Rather than build the technology from scratch, Puhakka partnered with data group LiquidMetrix and used execution infrastructure provided by agency broker ITG. Clients pay trading commissions as they would to any other regular broker. Three years after launching the system, with regulators scrutinizing dark pools and the publication of Michael Lewis' "Flash Boys" keeping high-speed trading on policymakers' agenda, Puhakka has 20 clients using the system and meeting regularly to give feedback. "The next logical step is that the buy side (investor) has to take control of the venues as well," he said, envisaging a new trading venue designed by the funds community. "The rule book would be written by the buy side ... We have had some discussions ... not just our group but a wider group."   NO REVOLUTION? Traders at three investment funds that use the Pohjola router -- Barings Asset Management, Swedbank Robur and IPM in Stockholm -- told Reuters control over trading was key. "We think that Pohjola has a different approach, that they work for the client and that they can take away toxicity from different dark pools," said Swedbank Robur's Hans Lindh. While none of the traders said they would restrict themselves to only using the Pohjola router - some big block trades might for example fare better with a bank that has the balance sheet to directly take on the risk - they agreed that it was one way of independently getting more transparency and data. Not everyone is convinced. Some brokers argue that they are already responding to clients by offering more detailed trade analysis and transparency. They also doubt that fund managers do enough trading on their own to justify a new stock market. "A revolution in trading has not happened yet," said Mark Goodman, head of quantitative electronic services for Societe Generale in Europe. "The detailed control remains with the broker." Even some asset managers say that the Pohjola route, while valid, is not something they would choose to use. Traders at three different funds said they would either seek to gather their own data from third-party providers or would focus on other parts of the trading process such as developing more algorithms to set the defining parameters of a trade. However investors choose to get more control, fund managers are acutely aware of the commercial risks at stake. "The buy side should be in a situation of more control going forward," said Simon Maughan, product specialist at financial-data supplier OTAS Technologies. "Fund managers say they are serving clients' interests but then they outsource their trading ... Lowering the cost of trading is going to be a major competitive advantage."   (Reporting by Lionel Laurent; Editing by Ruth Pitchford) FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Rick WilkingThe economy is warmer than expected.Goldman Sachs revised its estimate of second-quarter GDP growth to 4.7% on Thursday, based on new data from the Census Bureau's Quarterly Services Survey (QSS).  Stronger-than-expected healthcare spending growth led to the revised Goldman estimate of 4.7%, which was up 0.5% from the Bureau of Economic Analysis' second advance estimate of 4.2%. In the second quarter, the QSS forecast a healthcare spending growth of 3% annually from the first quarter and increase of 3.7% year-over-year. That was a rebound from a 2% drop in the first three months of the year. Through the first two quarters of 2014, spending on healthcare and social assistance has increased 3.3% year-over-year, according to the Census Bureau's data. Goldman made particular note of growth in nominal spending at hospitals, which increased at a 10.6% annual clip. The report "showed a strong bounce-back in healthcare spending in Q2, following weakness in Q1," Goldman said in a research note Thursday. "In particular, nominal spending at hospitals rose at a 10.6% annualized rate, quite a bit faster than the Commerce Department assumed in their first two estimates of Q2 GDP. Other aspects of the QSS were more similar to Commerce's assumptions." Goldman also maintained its estimate of a 3.1% GDP growth in the third quarter.  FREE AppDownload

As the U.S. economy picks up pace, its central bank is inching closer to raising interest rates, a move that will send ripples across the globe. In the euro zone, however, the European Central Bank is moving in the opposite direction in a desperate bid to rekindle growth and inflation. The United States is shaking off the hangover from a financial crisis that hammered Europe and even knocked mighty China off its stride. But the U.S. rebound, thanks in large part to cheap Fed money, now means Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen will have to decide when to pare back this support. Further hints as to when the first U.S. rate hike in more than eight years will happen could come on Wednesday in a statement after the bank's governors meet. "It does seem like a done deal that it is going to increase interest rates," said Paul Dales of economics consultancy Capital Economics. "We are going into a new phase where the Fed is trying to bring things back to normal. It can send reverberations around the world economy." Choosing when to increase the cost of borrowing in the world's biggest economy - a move expected next year - is a delicate balancing act. Yellen and others will be trying to work out how to keep the economic recovery on a steady keel without stopping it before the effects of the upswing lead to higher wages. By contrast, the European Central Bank recently cut the cost of borrowing to near zero and pledged to buy repackaged debt in a bid to kick-start lending to small companies. For some, the eventual move in Washington will be good news for Europe. "This will help to weaken the euro and a weaker euro will help countries like Ireland, Portugal and Spain to sell more to the rest of the world," said Philip Lane, an economist at Trinity College Dublin. But for others, the contrast underscores Europe's weakness. "America is so much further than Europe," said Joerg Kraemer, chief economist of Commerzbank. "Any hope of economic improvement here has disappeared over the Summer."   CULTURAL DIVIDE On the same day as central bankers gather in Washington, the euro zone will give further insight into why price inflation, an important yardstick of the recovery, plumbed new lows in August. On Thursday the ECB will also reveal how much of its first offer of four-year loans banks have taken up on condition that they lend on to businesses, as part of the central bank's efforts to bolster the flagging economy in the 18-country bloc. ECB President Mario Draghi says the aim is to get the ECB's balance sheet back near its 2012 peak via new measures, meaning it is aiming to inject the thick end of 1 trillion euros into the euro zone economy. Reuters polling shows that economists expect banks to take up 275 billion euros of the 400 billion the ECB will offer over time and that they will buy around 400 billion euros of asset-backed securities and covered bonds over the next two years under a separate scheme. Adding to Europe's woes, the conflict in Ukraine is making investors and companies nervous. Despite a fragile ceasefire between Ukrainian government forces and Russian-backed rebels, the EU has introduced further sanctions against Moscow. Sanctions are hurting Russia and further signs of that will be seen next week in data such as measures of fresh capital investment - once a major driver of its economy. The conflict has also hit business confidence in continental Europe, including industrial powerhouse Germany, which publishes the closely watched ZEW survey of investor sentiment on Sept 16. Unlike the United States, Europe's patchwork of nations and languages hampers efforts to coordinate economic policy, leaving much of the burden on the ECB. Even within nations there are divisions. On Sept. 18, Scotland will vote on whether or not to stay part of the United Kingdom. Should it choose independence, it would send shockwaves around Europe. Britain and Scotland would have to start dividing up their $2.5 trillion economy, North Sea oil and the national debt, while Prime Minister David Cameron would face calls to resign. Scotland would also have to decide what currency to use. London has said it could not use the pound, while British banks in Edinburgh, Lloyds (LLOY.L) and RBS (RBS.L), say they would move south.

In China annual growth has roughly halved since the financial crisis hit demand for its goods, and recent data has offered little to brighten the mainly gloomy global picture. China's central bank, like many of its global peers, has been pumping out cash to support the economy, raising the cost of living in cities such as Beijing, where a large two-bedroom flat can cost $1 million and a Starbucks coffee up to $6. The government has been slow to implement reforms to dilute the power of big state-owned enterprises such as China Telecom to make space for smaller start-ups. "Cutting interest rates may be possible if inflation falls further," said Zhu Baoliang, chief economist at State Information Centre, a top government think-tank in Beijing. "It's time to quicken reforms." For others, China's slowdown is more than just a temporary phenomenon and may even require a rethink about basic principles of economics with its relentless focus on growth. "It's a long-term trend that we are seeing here," said Guntram Wolff of Brussels think tank Bruegel. "We are seeing the limits of the growth model in the developed economies."   (Additional reporting by Lidia Kelly in Moscow, Kevin Yao in Beijing and Michael Flaherty in Washington; Editing by Hugh Lawson) FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersFrench President Hollande speaks during a news conference in ArbilPARIS (Reuters) - A bitter public attack by a jilted ex-partner, a cabinet melt-down and the admission of broken economic promises have meant an uncomfortable three weeks for Francois Hollande. But the hardest is yet to come for the French president, who this week embarks on a struggle to convince Socialist allies, the French people and his European Union partners that he is still fit to run the euro zone's second largest economy. On Tuesday he must stifle dissent within party ranks against his latest government team to win a confidence vote, thus averting new parliamentary elections his camp would be sure to lose. Two days later he hope to shore up his domestic approval ratings -- at 13 percent the worst for a French leader in polling history -- in a televised news conference set to last up to three hours. A no less crucial test comes the following weekend as Prime Minister Manuel Valls heads to Berlin to ask Angela Merkel not to press for EU penalties after France's admission it would break a promise to bring its public deficit within the bloc's limits. Socialist party managers put at 30 the number of hard-left deputies set to abstain in the confidence vote. They are still seething at Hollande's policy switch in January to favor tax cuts to business in a bid to revive the economy - a move that has failed to kickstart growth stuck barely above zero. Limited revolt of that order would allow the new government, re-shuffled last month after three rebel ministers were ejected, to scrape approval from the 577-seat assembly with support from center-left allies outside the Socialist Party. Hollande, whose image took a fresh knock last week with the publication of a best-selling book by former First Lady Valerie Trierweiler depicting him as smug and distant, will then seek to silence growing calls to resign before the 2017 end of his term. "He will be speaking directly to the French," said a senior Socialist briefed on the content of Hollande's preamble to the Sept. 18 news conference. "His message will be: 'You can say what you like - but I am staying till the end'." The constitution of France's Fifth Republic is specifically designed to let an incumbent leader do that, however unpopular. But the question being asked ever more loudly at home and abroad is: To do what? The government announcement on Wednesday that it would delay cutting its deficit by two more years went down badly with euro zone finance ministers at a meeting in Milan on Friday. Some saw it as an affront after the painful cuts many governments have implemented to bring down swollen deficits and win back investor confidence. But European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi's call in August for euro zone governments to do more to release growth has widened the debate and could mean France will get leniency from European Union partners on its deficit as long as it can prove it is serious about making its economy more competitive. "It's time to choose: leap forward or face decline," Bank of France governor Christian Noyer said last week. "If we continue with (economic) growth of just 0.5 percent a year while running deficits of four or five percent a year, it's obvious you fall off a cliff into poverty," he warned. A first test is on Oct. 1 when France presents a 2015 budget based on a deficit over one percent point higher than that allowed by EU rules but which Paris promises will stick to plans to shave 21 billion euros ($27 billion) off spending projections. Hollande's new government is also readying proposals to go beyond the modest labor market reform of 2013 to ease rules of worker representation in companies - which bosses say are a costly disincentive to hire - and to de-regulate professions from notaries to pharmacists and driving instructors. The reforms will not touch France's 35-hour working week and are seen as less incisive than the politically divisive measures carried out in Spain in recent years or the German labor market reforms of the mid-2000s. But the mood in France and among disgruntled back-benchers is such that they are set to trigger street protests and Valls has not ruled out using decrees to by-pass parliamentary resistance and pass them directly into law. "When I hear that France plans to use decrees to go faster, I welcome that," said International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde, a conservative former French finance minister. "Now, as the Americans say, is the time to deliver -- to go from words to deeds," she told Les Echos business daily last week.

Thomson ReutersThe logo of Russia's top crude producer Rosneft is seen in MoscowMOSCOW (Reuters) - Fresh U.S. and EU sanctions imposed on Moscow will bring an abrupt halt to exploration of Russia's huge Arctic and shale oil reserves and complicate financing of existing Russian projects from the Caspian Sea to Iraq and Ghana. On Friday, the United States imposed sanctions on Gazprom, Gazprom Neft, Lukoil, Surgutneftegas and Rosneft, banning Western firms from supporting their activities in exploration or production from deep water, Arctic offshore or shale projects. The new measures, designed to put further pressure on President Vladimir Putin over Russia's actions in Ukraine, are a major broadening of the previous sanctions, which only banned the export of high technology oil equipment into Russia. Projects now in jeopardy include a landmark drilling program by U.S. giant Exxon Mobil in the Russian Arctic that started in August as part of a joint venture with the Kremlin's oil champion Rosneft. Now this and dozens of other projects that Rosneft and Gazprom Neft agreed with Exxon, Anglo-Dutch Royal Dutch Shell, Norway's Statoil and Italian ENI will have to be put on hold. "Cutting off U.S. and E.U. sources of technology and services and goods for those projects makes it impossible, or at least extraordinarily difficult for these projects to continue...There are not ready substitutes elsewhere," a senior U.S. administration official told a briefing on Friday. The companies will have 14 days to wind-down activities. "There is no contract sanctity," the U.S. official said. Russia, the world's second-largest oil exporter, is counting on its Arctic and "tight" shale oil reserves to sustain production at around 10.5 million barrels per day, amid declining output at old West Siberian fields. Valery Nesterov from Russian state bank Sberbank, which was also sanctioned by the EU and the United States, foresaw serious complications. "What is really worrying are sanctions on tight oil. Russian companies haven't invested enough in research and technology. They were heavily relying on Western technologies and now it is simply too late," he said. Council on Foreign Relations Key among Russian tight oil reserves are the Bazhenov formations, which are located beneath existing mature west Siberian fields. They are estimated to contain as much as a trillion barrels of oil - four times the reserves of Saudi Arabia. Rosneft and Gazprom Neft are working on Bazhenov with Exxon and Shell. "When we learnt about the first sanctions we decided to speed up work on all fronts to minimize the damage to the company," said a Rosneft source. Rosneft's chief Igor Sechin, a close ally of Putin, said earlier this month the company had approved a program to replace all Western technology in the medium-term. Spokesman Mikhail Leontiyev said Rosneft's lawyers were studying the sanctions and their implications for joint Arctic drilling with Exxon. Rosneft has a total of 44 offshore deposits in the Arctic and the Black Sea, with estimated reserves of 300 billion barrels. It had planned to develop them with Exxon, ENI and Statoil. A Lukoil source said the new sanctions were a shock. "We were really not expecting to end up on the sanctions list," said a source at Lukoil, Russia's largest private oil company. Lukoil is the most active Russian company overseas and has assets ranging from deep-water projects off Ghana to shallow-water Caspian Sea activities and giant onshore operations in Iraq. It was planning to drill for tight oil in Siberia with French oil major Total. U.S. administration officials said on Friday the new measures were designed in such a way as to avoid affecting conventional production or foreign projects by Russian companies. "Lukoil's operations in the U.S., like for instance their filling stations, should not be affected," the senior U.S. official said. However, bankers and traders working with Lukoil said the sanctions will further complicate the company's ability to raise funds, including for its foreign projects like deep-water Ghana. Lukoil was the last Russian oil firm to raise a big Western loan - $1.5 billion including money from U.S. banks - but since July, when Western sanctions were expanded, all lending to Russian energy companies stopped. "Once you are on the sanctions list, lending becomes close to impossible," said a senior oil trader at a Western trading house, who works with Russian oil firms. U.S. administration officials said on Friday the new sanctions will further hit the Russian economy on the brink of recession and facing a 13-percent weakening of the rouble and $100 billion in capital outflows so far this year. If the energy companies turn to the central bank for financing, that will only draw down on the state's resources, the U.S. officials said. Vitaly Kruykov, director of Russian think-tank Small Lettres, said Russia - with forex reserves of $460 billion - had enough internal resources to last a maximum of two years under current sanctions. "Then Russia will have to go to Asia for financing but God knows what the cost of borrowing will be there. Asian lenders will quickly raise rates," said Kruykov.   (Additional reporting and writing by Dmitry Zhdannikov; editing by Keiron Henderson) FREE AppDownload
It seems like all businesses are moving online these days, so it's no surprise that the gaming industry is following suit. Morgan Stanley released a research note suggesting that the online gaming market might jump to $5.2 billion in less than six years. Theoretically, if all 50 states could launch online gaming, the market could be twice as large — at $10.7 billion. However, Morgan Stanley's Thomas Allen notes that this event is "unlikely given [the] limited chances of Federal approval and [the] fact that there are only 39 states with Commercial or Tribal casinos today." Here's the projection: Morgan Stanley It's worth noting that running an online gambling operation isn't easy money. These businesses aren't profitable when the doors open. Morgan Stanley makes two assumptions for these estimates. First, they assume that it will take four years for the businesses in early-adopter states to reach maturity, and for margins to ramp to their long-run rate estimate for 25%. Second, they assume that online gaming operators do not "break even in a given state" until the second year. However, the research note also adds that information from New Jersey online gaming operators suggests that the Morgan Stanley estimates could be "conservative." Some operators are already reaching the breakeven levels after approximately 10 months. Despite the huge growth potential, Morgan Stanley's hypothesis is actually a downgrade from earlier estimates. The group lowered their online gaming estimates following "lower-than-expected results to-date" in several early-adopter states. However, they maintain that they "remain bullish on the online gaming opportunity in the US." FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersLogo of German Reinsurer Munich Re is pictured before company's annual news conference in MunichMONACO (Reuters) - For a financial sector posting a double-digit rise in earnings and boasting large cash piles, reinsurers sure see a lot of storm clouds on the horizon. That's because they are facing what many see as an unprecedented problem: an abundance of reinsurance supply coupled with a lack of demand from insurance company clients that is driving up competition among reinsurers and driving down prices for all of them. The gloomy outlook has pressured the share prices of the world's top reinsurers this year and the frustration of normally staid industry executives - who gather this weekend at the Mediterranean resort of Monte Carlo for their annual jamboree - is palpable. "I am disappointed, exasperated, and even rather appalled by what is happening in the market," said Nikolaus von Bomhard, chief executive of the world's biggest reinsurer, Munich Re. "I've been in the business long enough to be able to say: this is bad news," he told a news conference last month. Looking at reinsurers' current profits, things might seem fine. The world's 31 top reinsurers - whose business is to help insurers pay big damage claims for disasters like hurricanes or earthquakes in exchange for part of the premium - posted a 12 percent rise in net income to $14 billion in the first six months of this year, compared with the same period last year, according to insurance broker Aon Benfield. Unusually low payouts for natural catastrophes in recent years have also bolstered the bottom line, contributing to a rise in the amount of capital available for reinsurers to act as insurance companies to insurance companies - which Aon Benfield said increased by 6 percent to $570 billion at the end of June from the end of December. On top of the big cash piles held by reinsurers such as Munich Re, Swiss Re and Hannover Re, outsiders have also been muscling in. Capital market investors such as pension, hedge and sovereign wealth funds as well as wealthy individuals, looking for higher returns than they can find on government or corporate bonds, have been pouring money into the reinsurance market via specialized investment vehicles. PRICE WAR As if that were not enough, insurers like Allianz, Axa and Zurich are feeling financially stronger and more capable of retaining risk, prompting them to cut back on the amount of reinsurance protection they buy. With the market shrinking, many reinsurers have been forced into successive rounds of price cuts or have granted improved terms and conditions to their customers to protect market share. Credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's sees prices on average down by 5-10 percent this year and next, with smaller and non-diversified reinsurers having the toughest time. "Those who aren't able to defend their competitive positions and their bottom lines could struggle to survive," said S&amp;P analyst Dennis Sugrue. Consolidation among smaller players has long been predicted but little has come to pass so far. Market observers predict the internecine price war is unlikely to come to an end any time soon and share prices will remain under pressure. The STOXX Europe 600 insurance index, which includes insurers and reinsurers, has risen by 4.8 percent since January - however this has been driven by insurers, with many reinsurers having lost ground. Munich Re's shares have fallen by 2.4 percent and No.2 player Swiss Re's by 1.2 percent. French reinsurer Scor is down nearly 10 percent so far this year. Faced with a difficult reinsurance market, big reinsurers are choosing to boost dividends and buy back their own shares, a move that credit rating agencies say makes sense. "Returning capital to shareholders reduces the pressure to do something that has higher risk," said Moody's analyst Stan Rouyer. "This is the right time to return capital to shareholders."   (Editing by Pravin Char) FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersHere's the Bank for International Settlements in Basel. The BIS serves as a bank for central banks.LONDON (Reuters) - Financial asset prices are at "elevated" levels and market volatility remains "exceptionally subdued" thanks to ultra-loose monetary policies being implemented by central banks around the world, the Bank for International Settlements said on Sunday. In its quarterly review, the BIS said financial market volatility spiked higher in August on the back of geopolitical concerns and worries over economic growth, but quickly returned to "exceptional lows" across most asset classes. "By fostering risk-taking and the search for yield, accommodative monetary policies thus continued to contribute to an environment of elevated asset price valuations and exceptionally subdued volatility," the BIS said. The comments echoed the institution's warning earlier this year that rock-bottom interest rates had led to "worrying" signs of unsustainable growth in property and credit markets in some countries. The U.S. Federal Reserve is on course to bring its bond-buying program to an end in October and is expected to begin raising interest rates next year. But if the Fed is stepping back, the European Central Bank is stepping up. The ECB has cut key rates, will offer hundreds of billions of euros of liquidity to banks, and purchase hundreds of billions euros of assets to try and ward off deflation and revive flagging growth. Anticipation of the ECB's largesse eclipsed concern over geopolitics and pushed credit spreads, bond yields and volatility back down again, the BIS said. There were several references in the report to the "extraordinarily" and "exceptionally" low levels of volatility, suggesting the BIS feels markets may be getting too complacent and therefore vulnerable - and therefore ill-equipped to a shock. Separately, the report also noted that overall international banking activity rose in the first quarter of this year, the first increase since 2011. Cross-border claims of BIS reporting banks rose a "significant" $850 billion, not enough to offset previous quarterly declines but enough to slow the year-on-year decline to 2 percent from 4 percent.   (Editing by Jeremy Gaunt) FREE AppDownload
Wikimedia CommonsHedge fund managers often like to opine on various topics that are largely unrelated to investing. In his latest lengthy quarterly letter to clients, Paul Singer of Elliott Management spent some time discussing a phenomenon that caught our attention and the attention of many others. It's the danger posed by an electromagnetic pulse.  Singer writes that an electromagnetic pulse is the "risk that stands way above the rest in terms of the scope of potential damage adjusted for the likelihood of occurrence." According to Singer, threats that are more manageable than an electromagnetic pulse include nuclear war and asteroids. From Singer's letter: The risks associated with electromagnetic pulse, or EMP, represent another story entirely. It can occur naturally, from solar storms that send 'coronal mass ejections,' which are massive energetic bursts of solar wind, tens of millions of miles in a mere few hours. Or it can be artificial, produced by a high-altitude (at least 15 miles) explosion of relatively low-yield (even Hiroshima-strength) nuclear weapons. Singer references an 1859 solar disturbance, known as the "Carrington Event," that disrupted the telegraph network, and says that just two years ago, "the sun let loose with a Carrington-magnitude burst, but the position of the earth at the time prevented the burst from hitting it. The chances of additional events of such magnitude may be far greater than most people think." Singer says an artificial EMP attack would have consequences more severe than a solar storm but notes that there is no way to stop a naturally occurring EMP. These two ways for an EMP to disrupt the electrical grid make the dangers of such an event "very real." Singer concludes by writing:  What can be done about this risk? Critical elements of the power grid and essential electronic devices can be hardened. Spare parts can be stockpiled for other, less critical hardware. Procedures can be developed as part of emergency preparedness so that the relevant government agencies and emergency response NGOs are ready to respond quickly and effectively to an episode large or small. Why are we writing about EMP? Because in any analysis of societal risk, EMP stands all by itself. In introducing his concern over EMPs, Singer notes that his letters "are typically overflowing with scary or depressing scenarios." While there is certainly a tinfoil-hat-wearing conspiratorial bent lurking within Singer's discussion, his concerns should not be overlooked. FREE AppDownload
APZhang Xiaoming isn't a fan of democracy.HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's most senior official in Hong Kong, Zhang Xiaoming, said on Friday that remarks he had made to pro-democracy lawmakers in an August 19 meeting had been misrepresented in media reports. "I admit that during the conversation, I used the phrase 'stay alive'," Zhang wrote in a statement on the website of China's Liaison Office in Hong Kong. Zhang made his comments after Reuters published a story on September 11 in which it reported that he had told several pro-democracy lawmakers that "the fact that you are allowed to stay alive, already shows the country's inclusiveness", according to two people who attended the August 19 meeting with Zhang and declined to be named. Zhang’s office did not respond to several faxed requests for comment before the September 11 story was published. The article, which was picked up by other media outlets, focused on the showdown between pro-democracy forces and Beijing over political reform in Hong Kong. Zhang said in the statement on Friday night that his intended meaning was that Beijing had already shown "great political inclusiveness" in allowing some democrat lawmakers to run for legislative office in Hong Kong. He said media reports of the meeting had a “malicious intention”.  The sources told Reuters in the September 11 story that Zhang had been responding to a question by democratic lawmaker Leung Yiu-chung, who asked whether a democrat like himself could run in an election for the highest office in the city. The meeting took place before China delivered its decision on August 31 on political reform in Hong Kong, which is governed under the “one country, two systems” arrangement which affords the city’s residents a high degree of autonomy and freedoms not enjoyed by Chinese on the mainland. One of the lawmakers quoted in the Reuters article said on Saturday that he was standing by his version of events. “I haven't misspoken," Lee Cheuk-yan, who attended the meeting with Zhang on August 19 and decided to speak on-record after Zhang’s statement, said in a phone interview. Reuters said in a statement on Friday: "We stand by our story and the original quote from Zhang Xiaoming, which was obtained from two independent sources who attended the meeting, as well as the accuracy of the Reuters translation." The statement was issued after some media and blogs said that Zhang’s comments had been mistranslated.   (Editing by Peter Hirschberg) FREE AppDownload
AP Photo/Wayne ParryMiss America contestants compete in the 2015 preliminaries in Atlantic City.Sept 13 (Reuters) - The winner of the 2015 Miss America Pageant will be crowned on Sunday night in Atlantic City, and the wearer's glittering tiara will stand in contrast to the tarnished fortunes of this New Jersey beach town where yet another casino is slated to close this week. The newest Miss America is choreographed to walk the 50-foot runway to the tune of "There She Is, Miss America," in a hall next door to Trump Plaza, whose slated shutdown on Tuesday means the gambling mecca will have lost a third of its casinos since the start of the year. Atlantic City officials hope the 94-year-old beauty pageant, which returned to the casino-dotted Jersey Shore town last year after eight years in Las Vegas, will help revive the city in the wake of recent financial turmoil. Three other casinos have shut down this year - the glitzy two-year-old Revel, the sprawling Showboat and the rundown Atlantic Club. The owner of the aging Trump Plaza is also threatening to close the enormous Trump Taj Mahal in November. Roughly 8,300 jobs have been cut so far this year. Since 2006, gambling revenue for Atlantic City has been cut nearly in half. "Obviously, our hearts go out to so many who have lost their jobs," said Sam Haskell, chief executive of Miss America Organization. "We hope that Miss America not only will generate more interest in Atlantic City, but will generate more local business." Pageant judges score contestants from the 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands based on a talent competition, a personal interview, their answer to an on-stage question, and their appearance in gowns and swimsuits. The pageant, which made its television debut 60 years ago, is scheduled to be broadcast live on Sunday starting at 8 p.m. EDT on ABC. The pageant is at the forefront of Atlantic City's efforts to rebrand itself as more than just a gambling town. "We're diversifying the amenities... and focusing on building out tourism opportunities for people to come and enjoy while they're here," said Susan Ney Thompson, a top official at the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority.   (Editing by Barbara Goldberg and Leslie Adler) FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersUkrainian President Poroshenko wipes his brow during a visit to the Ilich Iron and Steel Works in MariupolLONDON (Reuters) - A chance to buy the candy empire of Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko is the kind of opportunity in a fast-growing market that would normally have multinational confectioners - like Nestle or Cadbury's parent Mondelez - drooling at the prospect. But despite owning factories in four countries and making $1.2 billion in annual sales, Ukraine's "chocolate king" may have a hard time finding a buyer for his company, now that its founder is the leader of a country at war. "It’s all academic given the political situation at the moment," said a financial source closely following the situation. "But at its core it makes your mouth water." After years of combining his career as a billionaire candy boss with posts in successive governments, Poroshenko promised when he was elected in May to sell Roshen, the confectionary empire named for the middle two syllables of his surname. He has since hired advisors Rothschild and local firm Investment Capital Ukraine to drum up investor interest. On paper, there is a lot to tempt investors. Eastern Europe is a region with a sweet tooth, accounting for 12.8 percent of global candy sales despite a much smaller share of the world's population. Roshen is the region's second biggest locally-owned producer, ranked 18 in the world by net sales according to the Candy Industry Top 100. Apart from its main factories in Ukraine, it has plants in EU members Lithuania and Hungary as well as in Russia. In a region where tastes are still dominated by local habits, its decorative assortment boxes with names like "Kiev Evening" and "Royal Dessert" hold their own against global chocolate brands. Although it could be broken up into parts, an asking price that insiders say is likely to be around $1.5 billion means the company is probably too big to be swallowed whole by domestic players in Ukraine. That would seem to make it a perfect target for firms like Switzerland's Nestle or Mondelez, the U.S. snack and confectionary business split off from Kraft that includes Britain's Cadbury. Both are investing in the region and not shy about acquiring local brands. Nestle has looked at buying other confectionary businesses in Ukraine, the sources said, while Mondelez announced in April it is spending $110 million to open its fifth factory in Russia next year. But finding a buyer for a company associated with a war-time leader is no simple matter. Until last year, Russia accounted for about a fifth of Roshen's sales. But Moscow banned imports of Roshen's Ukrainian chocolates to Russia last year, officially on health and safety grounds, and shut its Russian factories in March in a criminal case that Kiev says is politically motivated. Since July, Russia has banned all Ukrainian chocolates. Kiev says Russian forces have supported pro-Russian separatists in the east of Ukraine in a conflict which has killed more than 3,000 people, although a ceasefire has been in place for a week. Moscow annexed Ukraine's Crimea peninsula in March and President Vladimir Putin now calls eastern Ukraine "New Russia", although he denies involvement in the war. Those close to the effort to sell Roshen say the company's prospectus is being shopped despite the conflict. "Contact has been made with prospective buyers but it's very preliminary," said one of the sources, who declined to be identified as the process is private. "This is a big and complex situation and any sale is not going to happen in a few weeks. Don't expect anything imminent." Financial sources closely following the deal said that given the tense political situation, any sales process is likely going to be complicated because commercial or strategic logic won't apply. Large international players are unlikely to table bids before the conflict is clearly over, they said. Roshen did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. ICU could not be reached. Rothschild declined to comment beyond confirming that it had been hired. Roshen would be attractive to confectionary companies in the low-to-mid-market chocolate range who are keen on expanding in emerging markets and willing to navigate political interference. Mars, the world's biggest chocolatier, is unlikely to be interested because it only markets its own brands. But in addition to Nestle and Mondelez, interested parties could include Korean firm Lotte which entered the region in 2010 with the purchase of Poland's Wedel from Kraft Foods, and Turkish food manufacturer Ulker.   (Additional reporting by Elizabeth Piper and Maria Kieselyova in Moscow; Editing by Peter Graff) FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Carlo AllegriA man dressed as Captain America after washing his hands in the bathroom at ComicCon in New York in 2013.The U.S. economy is in pretty good shape. GDP is growing, unemployment is falling, and we're seeing signs that wages may be on the rise. However, the U.S. economic story is actually just an aggregation of 50 economic stories. Previously, Business Insider examined ranked every state by how quickly the economies were growing. This time around, we calculated which states had the best economies outright.  We ranked each state on seven economic measures: the July unemployment rate; the change in nonfarm payroll jobs from June to July 2014; the 2013 GDP per capita; the 2012 per capita consumption; the 2013 average annual wage; the 2013 exports per capita; and the 2012 government expenditures.
