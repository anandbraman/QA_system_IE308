LEXINGTON Va (Reuters) - The Fed should fight low inflation as vigorously as it would a too rapid run-up in prices or risk the same sort of prolonged slow growth plaguing Japan and Europe, Boston Federal Reserve bank president Eric Rosengren said on Monday. Rosengren, in remarks at Washington and Lee University devoted to the potential costs of inflation that remains stuck below the Fed's two percent target, said the Fed's own credibility was at stake. Failure to get inflation to target, he said, raised the risk that investors and consumers would slip into deflationary thinking, changing their spending and investment patterns in ways that would further undermine growth. "Japan’s experience and now Europe’s current situation both indicate that indifference to very low inflation rates can generate a significant loss of confidence in the ability of a central bank to hit its inflation goal," Rosengren said, noting that low bond yields globally indicate investors have "little expectation" the Fed and other major central banks will be successful in lifting prices. He repeated his call for the Fed to remain patient in raising rates until it is more certain that inflation will rise to the Fed's target. As it stands, he said, a collection of global and domestic forces are conspiring against that - from the fall in commodity prices to slow growth among U.S. trading partners and the absence, so far, of broadbased wage increases in the United States. "The Federal Reserve must respond as vigorously to inflation that is too low as we have, historically, when inflation has been too high," he said. The Fed last month ended one of its major crisis response programs when it stopped adding to its monthly holdings of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities. But interest rates remain near zero, and the U.S. central bank must now judge when it is proper to begin raising them towards a more normal level. While that "liftoff" date had been expected towards the middle of next year, the lack of any clear uptick in inflation has become a central concern - enough so that some Fed officials have even discussed the possible need for further rounds of monetary stimulus. Rosengren ticked off a number of reasons why the inflation target is important, such as lightening the relative debt load for businesses and households, and reducing real wage costs for businesses.   (Reporting By Howard Schneider; Editing by Andrea Ricci) FREE AppDownload
For a central banker, deflation is one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse: Death, Famine, Disease, and Deflation. (We will address later in this letter why War, in the form of a currency war, is not in a central banker’s Apocalypse mix.) It is helpful to understand that, before a person is allowed to join the staff or board of a central bank, he or she is taken into a back room and given DNA replacement therapy, inserting a gene that is viscerally opposed to deflation. Of course, in fairness, it must be noted that central bankers don’t like high inflation, either (although, looking around the world, we see that the definition of high inflation can vary). In the developed world, 2% inflation seems to be the common goal. You wouldn’t think that 2% a year is a significant change in the overall price structure, but the panic among economists that would ensue with a 2% price deflation would border on hysteria. Inflation and deflation are often topics of discussions as I travel, but I find that there is general confusion about what inflation and deflation actually are. This is understandable, since many economists don’t agree on the definitions, so they are often talking about totally different phenomena. In this week’s letter I have for you a brief essay on the topic of deflation. Depending on your view, you might find some of my thoughts controversial, but I will try to make my case clear, at least. Please note this is the 30,000-foot view and is nowhere close to definitive. If you want great detail, I suggest you get my good friend Gary Shilling’s latest book on deflation (of four that I know of), called The Age of Deleveraging. (It’s only $11.49 on Kindle.) Definitions of Inflation and Deflation Generally speaking, there are two schools of thought about inflation. The Austrian school of economic theory, founded by Ludwig von Mises, sees inflation as an increase in the money supply and deflation as a contraction in the money supply. Somewhat similarly (but not entirely!), the monetarist school of economic theory tends to see money supply as the chief determinant of GDP in the short run and of the price level over the long run. Mainstream economics (generally Keynesian) tend to refer to rising or falling prices as inflation or deflation. They tend to see deflation as a general price decline, often brought about by reductions in available credit, money, or reserves or by the government’s restraint of spending programs. So when we talk about inflation/deflation, it is important to know whether we’re talking about monetary inflation or price inflation. As we have seen recently, a rising money supply is not necessarily accompanied by rising prices (although there is a certain long-term rhythm to the two different measures). When I talk to the general public about deflation being something to be avoided, I get confused looks. Don’t we like it when the price of something goes down? Who doesn’t love a sale on something they want to buy? Since the beginning of the First Industrial Revolution, the general tendency for the prices of manufactured goods (in real inflation-adjusted terms) has been to go down as productivity has gone up. This is what Gary Shilling and others refer to as “good deflation.” You can actually have solid productivity, GDP growth, wealth creation, a general increase in the standard of living, and a buoyant economy during a period of overall price deflation such as we had in the late 1800s – if it is the good kind of deflation. What is the difference between good deflation and bad deflation? Good deflation is the general fall in prices that comes from an excess supply of goods due to increased productivity and product improvement. From 1870 to 1897 wheat prices fell from $1.06 to 63¢ a bushel, corn from 43¢ to 30¢ a bushel, and cotton from 15¢ to 6¢ a pound. Most of the time farmers received even less for their crops. While farmers blamed all sorts of people for their falling prices, the primary cause of their problem was overproduction resulting from increases in the acreage of farms and increased yields per acre due to improved farming methods, as well as the advent of railroads that made it easy to get produce to Eastern markets. A farmer had to produce more just to stay even. It didn’t help that global competition from Argentina, Russia, and Canada was added into the mix, as increasingly large oceangoing steamboats made international transportation cheaper and ended an era of American agricultural export advantages. This period of time saw one-third of farmers move to the cities for other work as they lost their employment on small family farms. That trend in falling farm employment continued until recent years, and farming has seen even greater increases in productivity (yield per acre) in recent decades. Farm and ranch families are just 2% of the US population today. Only 15% of the US workforce produces, processes, and sells the nation food and fiber. Today’s farmers produce almost three times more food with 2% lower inputs than farmers did 60 years ago. A third of American agriculture is strictly for exports. The late 1800s was a particularly contentious period of history in the United States as farmers blamed railroads, bankers, and industrialists for their problems – a situation not unlike the income inequality debate we have today. And while falling prices weren’t fun for the farmers, the general public enjoyed lower food costs and higher-quality food. The easiest way to illustrate this trend in the modern area is by looking at the cost of a gigabyte of storage. You can see an interactive version of this chart here. Prices for a gigabyte of storage dropped from $500-700,000 in the early 1980s (depending on what you were buying) to about $0.03 today. Put another way, a gigabyte cost about 2 million times more 35 years ago than it does today. And it has fallen by 50% every few years. The good deflationary fall in prices for data storage has enabled all sorts of industries and products, creating millions of jobs. And we could find dozens of other, similar products whose prices have been falling dramatically.  Measuring Inflation/Deflation Each month we are greeted by the announcement of the Consumer Price Index (CPI), telling us what the level of general price inflation has been for the previous month and year. I’ve written about CPI extensively in past letters, but basically we need to understand that the CPI is an artificial amalgamation of the prices of various products and services. The composition of the CPI has changed significantly over the last 40 years. As John Williams at Shadow Stats demonstrates, if we used the same measurement methodology that was in force during the Reagan years or the early Clinton years, inflation would be almost 4 percentage points higher now than it is currently calculated to be.  Contrary to some commentators, I do not see this is a conspiracy to mislead investors or consumers, or to slow down the rise in Social Security payments. We should all be grateful that there is a small band of economists who are consumed by the details of what inflation actually is. They go to conferences and vehemently argue with each other (well, vehemently for academic economists) over arcane topics that would bore 99%-plus of the population. They are passionate about trying to find the proper measure of inflation. My personal feeling is that the adjustments that have been made in the calculation of inflation are generally quite reasonable, if somewhat controversial. With the prices of electronics and many other manufactured goods falling over the decades, how do you measure inflation in those items? Or rather deflation? I still spend about the same amount for a new phone today as I did 10 years ago, but my new iPhone 6+ is a major improvement over the Motorola flip phone I had 10 years ago, by any standard you want to apply. Both could make phone calls, but that is about where the similarity ends. Am I getting better value for my money? More bang for the buck? Absolutely. Currently, the economists who determine inflation see that increase in value as an actual drop in inflation, and they use a somewhat controversial methodology called hedonics to adjust the prices of a myriad of products for quality. If anti-lock brake systems are now standard whereas before they were optional, then by this doctrine the price of your car went down. (Those who are interested can google hedonics and get a wealth of information on the definition and the controversy.) Housing is a big component of our spending. Should we use actual housing prices or what the inflation economists call “owner’s equivalent rent prices” as our measure of housing cost increases? If we had used actual housing prices during the 2000s, the inflation figures would have gone through the roof, suggesting to the Federal Reserve that they should be raising interest rates rather than lowering them or keeping them too low. And again, if we had been using actual house prices to calculate inflation during the Great Recession, the economy would have been seen as being swamped by serious deflation. There would’ve been even more weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth. CPI is a useful measure by which to judge the overall trend of the economy, but we have to remember is that it is a simple statistical construct. Just because the CPI says inflation is 2% doesn’t mean that inflation for you as an individual or for the economy in general is actually 2%. It is 2% inflation based on current assumptions and methodology. There is a margin of error. The CPI is one of those statistics about which you can say, “it’s close enough for government work,” … because it actually is government work. We have to try to measure price inflation for a host of government and business reasons, but we need to apply a healthy dose of economic reasoning, a little salt if you will, to the stew that is CPI. Asset Inflation Versus Price Inflation I was at a conference last month where the rules of participation forbid me from naming the other attendees or disclosing the specifics of what they said without their permission. But I can talk about ideas I picked up. So, name-brand economists (think Nobel Prize winner and central bankers) argued that inflation is too low and that the Fed should continue to provide a stimulative monetary policy and work towards bringing inflation back up. They also argued for a much higher inflation target than 2%. A famous hedge fund manager raised his hand in the give-and-take and argued that there is plenty of inflation in the United States; it is just asset-price inflation, and nobody complains about that. By that he meant that we have seen a significant rise in the stock market and other asset classes (including real estate) because of current Federal Reserve monetary policy. I won’t say that his rejoinder was summarily dismissed, but I felt his point was more or less ignored. We (as in “us guys and gals in the market,” which probably includes you) don’t see an increase in the prices of our stocks and other assets as inflation. We just like to think that the market is finally recognizing the value that we saw when we invested in them. The Fed purposely engineered a rising asset-price level because they felt there would be some trickle-down from what is called the wealth effect – i.e., if people have more net worth due to a rising stock market, they will likely spend that money and stimulate the economy. The trouble is, nearly every recent academic paper on the topic has demonstrated that there is, in fact, either no or very little wealth effect. Wall Street, bankers, and investors have made out like bandits under the current policy; and Main Street hasn’t benefited to nearly the same extent. The problem with asset-price inflation is that prices generally keep rising until they’ve gone too far, and then they fall and you get asset-price deflation. And asset-price deflations (otherwise known as bear markets) are highly correlated with and sometimes the cause of recessions. The hedge fund manager was expressing a view held by many people (including your humble writer), that by purposely targeting stock market prices the Fed may be laying the groundwork for the next asset-price deflation and recession. It is one thing for the Fed to lower rates in order to stimulate borrowing and thereby theoretically increase demand, and another thing altogether to engage in quantitative easing to stimulate stock markets. At precisely what point did the Federal Reserve decide that they needed a third mandate, that is, to boost asset prices? The only two Congressional mandates for the Fed are to control inflation and stimulate employment. It is not entirely clear what the transfer mechanisms are from monetary policy to employment, so that second mandate is suspect as to how it could actually be implemented, in the opinion of many. There is a lot of theory, and there are demonstrable correlations; but the evidence, in my opinion, that quantitative easing did anything to stimulate employment is sketchy. While unemployment has fallen during the recent periods of quantitative easing, correlation is not causation. One thing we do know is that significant asset-price deflation almost always leads to a recession and to price disinflation, if not temporary deflation. So Who’s Afraid of Deflation? If good deflation is not a problem, what constitutes bad deflation? One major cause of deflation is decreased aggregate demand, which is a function of insufficient income and/or availability of credit. This bad type of inflation is typically associated with lower corporate profits and bear markets. It also generally results in lower wages and rising unemployment, which if not halted can become a self-reinforcing downward spiral. As an aside, this is one of the reasons that Janet Yellen keeps talking about income inequality (lately, somewhat ad nauseam). The demonstrable stagnation of wages of the middle class clearly has a negative effect on aggregate demand. From a Keynesian point of view, the lack of aggregate demand is something both to worry about and to counter. One of the elements of inflation is rising wages. It is hard to get serious inflation (over 2%) without a concurrent rise in wages. And in general we have not seen a rise in average hourly wages since the end of the recession (for a variety of reasons). The following chart is for the last eight years, but we’ve all seen numerous charts demonstrating that inflation-adjusted wages have been stagnant for well over a decade if not longer.  This is one of those chicken-and-egg arguments that economists frequently have. There are those who think that if we can stimulate aggregate demand then that will increase profits and GDP and will result in rising wages and lower unemployment. And then there are those (including your humble writer) who think the problem is inadequate income and not enough productivity. In this scenario rising incomes will increase aggregate demand. If that is your philosophy, then the focus of government policy should be not on making it easier to borrow money but on making it easier to make money. And perhaps on giving people a chance to keep more of the money they do earn. And Then There Is Debt Deflation And now we come to the real problem that central bankers and governments have with deflation: it makes debt more expensive and thus more difficult to pay back. Deflation is not kind to borrowers, especially governments. It is not unusual to look at government debt in relationship to the size of the economy as measured by gross domestic product, or GDP. When Dick Cheney argued way back in the dark ages of the last decade that deficits don’t matter, he was arguing that if the economy is growing faster than the debt is rising, then your debt relative to GDP is shrinking. I don’t think in his wildest nightmares he ever thought we would see debt rising by 6-7% of GDP per year (or more). When we talk about GDP, we have to know whether we mean nominal or real GDP. For newbies, nominal GDP is GDP unadjusted for inflation, while real GDP is actual growth after inflation is factored out. If I borrow $200,000 to buy a house, that debt is not inflation-adjusted every year. I negotiate an interest rate that presumably the lender thinks will give him a return over and above the inflation rate. If my income falls, then the percentage of my income I need to pay for that mortgage increases. My debt-to-income ratio increases even though the loan amount stays the same. Deflation is generally associated with recessions (at least in the modern era). In a recession GDP will shrink and government income from taxes will fall. Even if there is no increase in the debt, the debt-to-GDP ratio will rise as GDP falls. Let’s look at Japan. There the government is trying to engineer a nominal growth rate of at least 4%. They are hoping to have 2% real growth plus 2% inflation. The problem for Japan is that they have had almost no nominal growth for over 20 years, a period they call the Lost Decades. The country has often been mired in outright deflation. And if, as Japan has done, you borrow 5 to 7% of GDP per year in order to run deficits to try to stimulate demand (classical Keynesian theory), you will eventually get to the place where Japan is today, with a debt-to-GDP ratio of around 250%. The only possible ways they can bring that ratio down is to increase nominal GDP to a level above that of the rate of borrowing – or to monetize the deficit and/or actual debt. According to my friend Nouriel Roubini, in 2013 Japan’s total tax revenue fell to a 24-year low. Corporate tax receipts fell to a 50-year low. Japan now spends more than 200 yen for every 100 yen of tax revenue it receives. It is likely Japan will run an 8% fiscal deficit to GDP this year, but the Bank of Japan is currently monetizing at a rate of over 15% of GDP, thereby theoretically reducing the level of debt owed by government institutions other than the central bank. At some point, when the Bank of Japan has monetized enough debt and the government is running something close to a nominal surplus, including debt service, the debt on the balance sheet of the Bank of Japan will have simply been made to go away (whether de facto or de jure makes no difference – as long as the government is not paying on the debt). But that monetization comes at a cost. The yen is already down 40% in buying power against a number of currencies, and another 40-50% reduction in buying power in the coming years is likely, in my opinion. Such a reduction in debt is currently not possible in the Eurozone, which means that European governments must increase their debt at a slower rate than their nominal GDP growth. Since they are all (except Germany) running 3-4%+ deficits and most of the continent is in recession, their debt-to-GDP ratio is getting progressively worse each year, making it more expensive for them to pay off their debt. Even if you think that outright debt monetization is a good thing (and many Keynesian economists do), to implement it would take an almost-impossible-to-achieve rewriting of the treaty that created the Eurozone or a willingness by all the members (and their courts) to ignore the current treaty. Is it possible to reduce your debt-to-GDP ratio without falling into some sort of austerity-dominated recession? Absolutely. The US did it following the Clinton/Gingrich compromise in the mid-’90s. We were actually reducing our debts and running surpluses at the end of the Clinton era. But the United States had a very obliging set of circumstances in those days. Not only did we have high growth, we had inflation (as measured by CPI) that averaged well above 2%. Notice in the chart below that nominal growth averaged roughly 6% in the ’90s and has barely averaged 4% so far this decade. (For those looking at the chart in black and white, the upper line is nominal GDP.)  This past week we learned that the 2014 government deficit will be only 2.8% of GDP (it last saw that level in April 2005), the first time in a long time it has been below nominal GDP. It is projected to fall again next year before rising in 2016. For the United States, this represents a reprieve, allowing us some time to deal with potential future problems before government spending rises to a proportion of income that is impossible to manage without severe economic repercussions. Government spending on mandated social programs will rise more than 50%, from $2.1 trillion this year to $3.6 trillion in 2024, potentially blowing the deficit out of control. If the US economy were to slip into deflation, it would clearly become more difficult to both service the debt and reduce the total debt. And thus the central bank and government aversion to deflation. Not to mention that the experience around the world of deflationary times has not been pleasant. It has been quite some time since we have seen good deflation for any sustained period of time in an economy in the developed world. Is global deflation in the near future possible? The short answer is yes, for several reasons. Commodity prices are falling all over the world and especially in dollar terms. This is a result of the high prices of the last decade, which resulted in excess supply in a world where demand growth is trending lower, especially the demand growth provided by China. Commodity prices are a key component of the prices of all manufactured goods and of food. Wages are stagnant, and in general it is hard to see wage inflation, although my friend David Rosenberg swears he can see it coming in his charts. Given the deflationary environment we are in, an increase in wages would be a welcome event. Stagnant wages are a prescription for weak retail sales growth, thus keeping a lid on inflation. It is very possible that we could see asset-price deflation in the near future and an accompanying bear market. A few weeks ago I discussed the possibility that the next recession will actually be led by a bear market as opposed to the bear market simply resulting from a recession. I should note that the recent bubble-like levels of subprime corporate credit and junk bonds have set up the potential for a collapse in debt valuations. Shades of 2008. And last but not least, the rising dollar is also somewhat deflationary. A rising dollar in and of itself is not enough to create deflation, but it can help create an environment where deflation takes root. The elements of a deflationary surprise are all in place. Given the composition and economic beliefs of the current Federal Reserve governing bodies, it is more than likely that monetary policy would become even more easy and quantitative easing would resume should we get close to 0% inflation. The Last Argument of Central Banks King Louis XIV had the words Ultima Ratio Regum or “The Last Argument of Kings” cast on the sides of his cannons. Central bankers exercise an equivalent last argument when they fight deflation by monetizing debt and lowering their currency valuations. Japan is clearly trying to export its deflation. It has deployed the largest monetary cannons in history and is likely to double down over the next few years. Europe would like to do the same, and a falling yen may force it to do so. One of the classic ways (at least in theory) to fight deflation is debt monetization, which leads to currency wars. At the beginning of this letter I said that the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse for central bankers are Death, Disease, Famine, and Deflation. I substituted Deflation for War because the monetary equivalent of war is a currency war, and evidently central bankers today don’t see that as a problem that rises to the level of the problems created by deflation. Too much debt – the environment we find much of the world in today – is inherently deflationary, as debt service takes away from current consumption. Debt is future consumption denied, and at the end of a debt supercycle future consumption and thus total GDP are going to be constrained until the debt is dealt with in some manner. Too much debt has often led to some kind of deflationary period. For all intents and purposes, much of peripheral Europe went through a deflationary recession/depression following the last debt crisis. And their debt has not really been dealt with: it is still hanging around to create a problem in the not far-distant future. Can you monetize your way out of a deflationary collapse brought on by too much debt? Paul Krugman and the monetary authorities of Japan think you can. Japan is running one of the great economic experiments of all time. Can a productive, generally got-its-business-act-together country monetize 200% of its GDP without devastating, or at least seriously affecting, the buying power of its currency? And at what cost to its trading partners and those countries and companies that must compete against Japanese exports? I think the coming currency war and the potential for protectionism are the most serious challenges we will deal with in the global economy over the next five years. Stay tuned. New York and New Technology I fly to New York on Tuesday, where I will speak at a large institutional conference (and get to hear my friend Ian Bremmer make a presentation earlier in the day). I fly back on Friday after a series of meetings and will then be home for the rest of the month. Or at least that is the plan. Things will be quite busy here since, for once, people are coming to see me rather than the other way around. I mentioned my new iPhone 6+ earlier. For the first time in the seven years since the iPhone was introduced, my new iPhone actually lets me go a whole day without having to carry a charger with me. Admittedly, there is no new geewhiz technology associated with the battery; it’s just that the larger phone allows a larger battery. Which, given that I wanted a larger screen (to accommodate my old eyes), seems like a pretty good deal. An 8-megapixel camera is going to finally force me to start taking more pictures. Maybe it will actually spur me to start posting on Facebook and Twitter more often. The only problem is that I have a face more suitable for radio than video. And speaking of new technology, Patrick Cox and I have been sharing notes on his recent work on all the fascinating research emerging in a whole new developing branch of nutraceuticals. A few months ago he persuaded me to add a few of the recent developments to my daily pill regime. We are starting work on a report on that topic, which will include a list of the nutraceuticals and other supplements we take. Neither of us feels that is something we can charge for, so we’re going to make it free, with the caveat that while we are quite willing to be guinea pigs, you will need to consult your doctor before taking anything. I’m sure I’m taking a number of pills that have no meaningful nutritional or health value; the problem is, I don’t know which ones. Whatever I’m doing, it seems to be working. I am loath to mess with what is (so far) a winning formula. Knock on wood. And we will soon be releasing a fabulous new documentary on Bitcoin that my team at Mauldin Economics has produced. It is actually network quality, and I’m quite proud of it. Coming to a computer screen near you – watch for it. The kids are coming over later to celebrate Melissa’s 34th birthday. Some of you may remember that she had a thyroid cancer scare a few years ago. And while we dealt with the cancer, one of the problems of thyroid removal is that you have to substitute synthetic hormones. You would think after 40-odd years of doing this, modern medicine would have it down to an exact science. As it turns out, that is not the case. It is somewhat of an art form to get the dosage right, and there are multiple ways to go about it. You start with a theoretically correct dosage and then adjust from there depending on how you feel. Naturally, with Melissa it was more complicated than that. Her body was not dealing with the synthetic hormone properly, requiring more medications and adjustment. It was just never quite right, and she was always physically out of kilter. Some 90 days ago she was put on a brand-new drug that is a derivative of pig thyroid hormone rather than synthesized hormones. For the first time in almost two years she seems to have balanced out. Her energy levels have increased, and I actually feel like I have my old Melissa back. I can smell the chili starting to cook. Melissa inherited my creative kitchen style and has a gift for cooking. Which is to say that we make it up as we go along, and it generally ends up extraordinarily well. If I was half the writer I am a cook, my readers would be even happier. Have a great week. I’m going to start mine off right as a masseuse shows up later tonight and tries to work out some of the kinks.

The parent company of Hellmann's mayonnaise is suing a company that makes a mayo substitute for fraud, in part because the mayo substitute is denting Hellmann's sales, The New York Times reports. Unilever filed the lawsuit against Hampton Creek, a startup that replaces eggs with plant ingredients in foods like cookie dough and mayonnaise. In the complaint, Unilever notes: "Just Mayo already is stealing marketshare from Hellmann’s" and says that "as Hampton Creek’s distribution and advertising increases, the irreparable harm to Unilever will continue and worsen." The suit is asking for Hampton Creek to pay Unilever's legal fees, pay three times the startup's profit in damages, stop using an egg symbol as its logo, stop using ads that might be misleading and tell consumers that Just Mayo is superior to Hellmann's, and recall Just Mayo products, according to The Times. Hampton Creek, which is backed by big-time investors including Bill Gates and Yahoo founder Jerry Yang, took a direct hit at Hellmann's in some of its promotional materials that advertise Just Mayo's sustainability and health benefits. Hampton Creek says its plant-based substitute is more cost effective and environmentally friendly than products that use eggs. But Unilever says the company can't call its spread "mayo" because it doesn't meet the definition set by the Food and Drug Administration that specifies that mayonnaise has to contain a certain amount of vegetable oil and egg yolk. Joshua Tetrick, CEO of Hampton Creek, told Business Insider that's not the case. "We feel good about where we are from a legal perspective," he said, adding that the company has no plans currently to change the product's name. "We're going to hold steady the name that we feel strongly about," Tetrick said. A product that tastes like mayo but doesn't have as many fattening ingredients will be attractive to many consumers, so it's no surprise that Just Mayo is cutting into Hellmann's sales. Unilever released this statement to Business Insider: We are a strong supporter of innovation both within and outside our company. Our concern here is not about innovation, it is about misleading labelling as it is simply not accurate to label the Hampton Creek product as 'Mayo' or to reinforce the link with images of  ingredients, in this case eggs, that are not even used. In contrast, our Hellmann's brand is made from real eggs and delivers great taste. We simply wish to protect both consumers from being misled and also our brand. FREE AppDownload
Is the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing stimulus program responsible for stock market gains? There are two schools of thought on this: Yes, and No. The Yes camp maintains that the easy money being pumped into the economy (via quantitative easing) by the Federal Reserve flowed not into the real economy but financial markets, inflating the price of stocks, bonds, and other financial assets. The No camp says that a recovering US economy and steady earnings growth has powered the market higher.  Ethan Harris, a global economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, wrote in a note to clients over the weekend: "Every time the end of a QE program looms, pundits warn of a big shock to markets and the economy. In the business press, the story of exactly how this happens keeps shifting to fit the facts." The main target of Harris' critique is the above chart, which has been a favorite among the "QE-truthers," or folks who believe the Fed's policies are directly responsible for the rise in the stock market.  But the big problem Harris has with this chart is, well, basic statistics.  "Implicitly, this chart assumes that the markets are not forward looking and it is the implementation of Q that drives the stock market: when the Fed buys, the market booms and when it stops, the market swoons," Harris wrote. "As our readers know, we think this relationship is a classic case of spurious correlation: anything that trended higher over the last 5 years has a 90%-plus correlation with the Fed's balance sheet." Harris also walks through multiple narratives that have shifted over the past few years, pointing out, among other theories, the idea that the Fed ending its QE program could have caused a selloff in bonds in 2013 but a rally in 2014.  "Boy is ending QE powerful," Harris wrote.  In our latest Most Important Charts feature, Greenlight Capital's David Einhorn highlighted the trouble with correlations, pointing out that the "any two lines" school of charting and financial argument can be not just highly — but ridiculously — flawed.  Here are two facts: the size of the Fed's balance sheet has risen in the past five years; the stock market has risen in value over the past five years. That one of these caused the other is less clear.  FREE AppDownload
Atlanta FedFor part-time workers, wages are going nowhere. This is the latest chart from John Robertson and Ellyn Terry, published at the Atlanta Fed's macroblog. As the researchers say in their post, the data is pretty noisy, but it seems clear that something happened to part-time wage growth between 2011 and 2013 — after tracking pretty closely to full time wage growth over the last decade and a half, it pretty clearly detached in 2011. In a previous post, Lei Fang and Pedro Silos at the Atlanta Fed broke down the median wage growth by education as well as time spent at work. There's a pretty clear drop there for part-time workers without a college degree, that then stagnates just above 1% wage growth around mid-2012. Given that the inflation rate was 3% in 2012, these workers were effectively getting a pay cut. Atlanta FedThere's a pretty clear drop there for part-time workers without a college degree. There is some good news in the recent data, in that wages seem to be rising a bit more. But there are still a lot of involuntary part-time workers feeling the sting even more thanks to wages that just won't budge. Here's more from Robertson and Terry's post: "The SIPP data used by Fang and Silos ended in mid-2013. The more recent CPS data suggest that overall wage growth has picked up during the last year and that the wage growth gap has closed a bit, which are encouraging findings. But the wage growth of part-time workers, as a group, continues to lag well behind that of full-time workers. The relatively low wage growth of part-time workers heightens the importance of the fact that the number of people working part-time—especially involuntarily part-time—remains elevated."

 Billionaire Peter Thiel is as well known for being the cofounder of PayPal and the first outside investor in Facebook as he is for his free thinking. He outlines many of his contrarian views, such as why successful companies should strive to be monopolies, in his book "Zero to One." Thiel has previously said that the contemporary French philosopher René Girard has had a tremendous impact on his life, and he told author and investor Tim Ferriss that he considers "Things Hidden Since The Foundation of the World" to be Girard's masterpiece. Girard's main concept is "mimetic theory," which states that most of human behavior is based upon imitation. The imitation of desires leads to conflict, and when a buildup of conflict threatens to destroy all involved, they use a scapegoat to return to balance. Much of Girard's work delves into Christian theology, which has also had a profound effect on Thiel. We had a chance to ask Thiel how his favorite Girard work has shaped his worldview, career, and even his faith. Here's what he said. Business Insider: When did you first read "Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World"? Has your interpretation of Girard's philosophy changed as you've gotten older? Peter Thiel: I first read "Things Hidden" when I was an undergraduate at Stanford. Girard ranges over everything: every book, every myth, every culture — and he always argues boldly. That made him stand out against the rest of academia, which was and still is divided between two approaches: specialized research on trivial questions and grandiose but nihilistic claims that knowledge is impossible. Girard is the opposite of both: He makes sweeping arguments about big questions based on a view of the whole world. So even when you set aside the scandalous fact that Girard takes Christianity seriously, there is already something heroic and subversive about his work. "Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World" is an intimidating book. Girard warns on the very first page that he has "deliberately left out all concessions to the reader." However hard it seems at first, Girard's philosophy always stresses a few key points. Simplest of all is the idea that imitation is at the root of all behavior. I've noticed that it takes a long time to really sink in. You can understand what his words mean as philosophical concepts without understanding how those concepts play out in life. It's hardest of all to see how they apply to yourself. I would say that there is no difference in my interpretation of Girard at the level of ideas, but now I have a better sense of how deep his ideas go. BI: You've mentioned that you are conscious of your desire to not become distracted by competition in your pursuits. How much has Girard's theory of mimetic desire and its negative outcomes influenced this approach? Stanford University Press"Things Hidden" has significantly shaped the way Thiel thinks. PT: According to Girard, imitation is inescapable. As a rule, we do what we do just because other people are doing it, too. That's why we end up competing for the same things: the same schools, the same jobs, the same markets. Economics will tell you that competition dilutes profits, and that’s one big reason to question it. Girard gives at least two more reasons: (1) competitors tend to become obsessed with their rivals at the expense of their substantive goals, and because of that (2) the intensity of competition doesn't tell you anything about underlying value. People will compete fiercely for things that don't matter, and once they're fighting they'll fight harder and harder. You might not be able to escape imitation entirely, but if you're sensitive to the way it drives us then you're already ahead of most. BI: How have you seen both the theories of mimetic desire and the scapegoat mechanism manifested in Silicon Valley? PT: When the payments company Square came out with its flagship credit card reader, competitors jumped in one after the other to do the same thing with triangles or half-moons instead of squares. That's the comical example I cite in "Zero to One." A more dangerous phenomenon is the desire for the same position within a company: startups are small, they move fast, and roles are fluid, so there is lots of potential for conflict. As for scapegoating, what happened to Bill Gates during the antitrust prosecution of Microsoft is a great example of the tendency to gang up and blame one person. BI: How has Girard's interpretation of Christianity affected the way you practice your religion? Has your spirituality influenced the ways you've decided you would like to leave an impact on humanity? PT: To see the difference Girard makes, consider the Book of Revelation. It's the last thing in the New Testament. It's very strange. What could it mean to someone today? There are two common views: Secularists see a bunch of crazy gibberish that should be ignored or mocked. Fundamentalists see an authentic prophecy of divine vengeance. Girard says there is another, deeper answer: The destruction that Revelation describes is real, but we can't blame it on an angry, violent deity. We have created weapons capable of violence on a biblical scale. In the event of apocalypse, we will be responsible. Blaming the gods for our own violent acts is what humans have done throughout the whole history of religion. But as Girard reads them, the Gospels reveal that God is not violent. He has no need to get into a fight. He is not our rival. What God actually is and what it means to be created in God's image is not something to capture in a sound bite, but it certainly begins with creation and continues with life. BI: Is there a particular section of "Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World" that has particularly influenced you or that you suggest readers new to Girard become familiar with? PT: There's not an easy way into "Things Hidden." It's not obscure; it's just densely packed. The best place to start reading Girard might be with whatever part of culture you're most interested in, because he's probably written about it. If you like classic novels, read his first book, "Deceit, Desire and the Novel." If you're interested in mythology, read "Violence and the Sacred." If you like Shakespeare, read "Theater of Envy." If you know the Bible, read "I See Satan Fall Like Lightning." If you want a view of his whole career over time, look at "The Girard Reader." And if you want to immerse yourself in all his ideas at once, stick with "Things Hidden."  FREE AppDownload
Things aren't great in Europe.  Economic growth has been anemic, and some economies in the eurozone are already contracting.  Meanwhile inflation, which is one of the European Central Bank's main goals, has been tepid. On Monday, former Bank of England economist Tony Yates wrote that the eurozone may have already fallen into deflation.  And just last week, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD, published its latest growth projections for the global economy, which showed the eurozone growth lagging other major economies.  This report also said the ECB needs to act to head off deflation, and while ECB president Mario Draghi last week reiterated the central bank's intentions to increase the size of its balance sheet, it remains to be seen if these actions will be effective. In a note to clients over the weekend, however, Bank of America Merrill Lynch strategist Michael Hartnett highlighted an even more troubling chart for Europe, which shows the declining percentage of global earnings coming from Europe. "25 years on from the fall of the Berlin Wall, and Europe is arguably one recession away from severe political and social stress," Hartnett wrote.  And signs of this stress have already popped up, as over the weekend 81% of voters in Catalan voted in favor of independence from Spain.  But aside from any one economic or political force, one thing is clear: the European economy is is decline.  Business Insider FREE AppDownload
Business journalist Bethany McLean is best known for her work exposing corruption at Enron in the early 2000s, but her first job out of college was actually as an analyst in Goldman Sachs' mergers and acquisitions department. In a LinkedIn post earlier this year, McLean writes that while her years at Goldman Sachs were "miserable," she came away from the experience having learned a great deal. So much, in fact, that she today recommends that anyone given the opportunity should take a job in finance. Here are four valuable lessons she learned from working at Goldman Sachs: 1. Always pay attention to details. Prior to arriving at Goldman in 1992, McLean was primarily interested in big ideas, without much regard for small details. This changed quickly when she accidentally mixed up a pair of data sets in a chart depicting growth rates in the ice cream and frozen yogurt markets. The anger directed at her by her boss during a flight from New York City to Mexico has stuck with her to this day. She writes, "I have made mistakes as a journalist, and I'm sure I'll do so again. But I've never again disrespected the details." 2. Be skeptical of statistics. At Goldman Sachs, McLean's managers would frequently ask her to alter her mathematical formulas in order to change how a financial projection looked. This taught her that using numbers in an argument doesn't always make your argument true.  "Many numbers are nothing more than the wobbly assumptions that go into them," she writes. This understanding would be crucial to exposing Enron's fraudulent accounting practices in her 2004 book, "The Smartest Guys in the Room."  3. The only way to solve a problem is to keep working at it. While she could always get help from other students and professors as a math major at Williams College, McLean says the only way to complete a difficult analysis at Goldman Sachs was to figure it out herself — even if it took all night. This lack of assistance forced her to be self-sufficient in a way she previously had not been, a skill that has served her well when reporting open-ended, complex magazine stories. "As a magazine journalist who starts most stories cold, I often get that same slightly panicked feeling of not knowing where to begin," she writes. "But now I know that if I somehow get started, even if I'm not sure where to start, what seemed incomprehensible somehow will become steadily clearer." 4. Finance isn't so confusing once you know a little bit about it. While she was initially intimidated by the financial system, McLean's work as an analyst allowed her to understand the industry's language in a way that would allow her to write intelligently about it later on. "People at Goldman also used to say, 'This isn’t rocket science,'" she writes. "It isn’t — although the only way I would have learned that was by doing it. From what I've seen as a journalist, I am not alone.  Read the rest of McLean's post on LinkedIn &gt;&gt; FREE AppDownload
Bonus payouts might miss the expectations of many Wall Streeters this season. Johnson Associates published its latest projections for Wall Street compensation on Monday. Incentives for people working in hedge funds, fixed income and equities could drop as much as 10 percent from 2013, a copy seen by Business Insider shows.  Hedge fund bonuses rose by as much as 15% last year, according to a similar survey. Retail and commercial banking bonuses are projected to stay flat, while employees in investment banking and private equity firms could see a 10 - 15% rise in their bonuses.  The poll tallies responses from Wall Street's biggest banks and asset managers.  Last month, we reported that 60% of Wall Streeters are expecting their bonuses to increase this year. We also reported that Bloomberg projects Morgan Stanley's investment bankers will have the best bonuses on Wall Street, while JP Morgan and Citi's bond traders will see the least payouts.  FREE AppDownload
It's hard to get your foot in the door of Morgan Stanley, the bank that pulled in $8.9 billion in revenue in the third quarter of 2014.  Landing a spot in its summer internship program is near impossible: 90,000 people applied to the gig this year, but only 1,000 were accepted, making for a 1.1% acceptance rate.  But if you do make it in, you're going to get paid. Case in point: Its junior bankers received a 25% raise over the summer. To figure out just how much Morgan Stanley employees make, we looked through self-reported salary and bonus numbers on Glassdoor, the job reviewing site.  As is characteristic of Wall Street firms, Morgan Stanley has some outrageous bonuses. Of those self-reported to Glassdoor, the Investment Banking Associate position stands out — while the base salary is a solid $111,801, the annual compensation jumps up to $233,446 after bonuses. Here's the combined compensation — annual salary and bonus — for 15 positions at Morgan Stanley, in ascending order:  FREE AppDownload
Daniel Goodman / Business InsiderVeterans Day on November 11 is a time to honor those who have bravely served in the military and thank them for their sacrifice and dedication to their country. It's also the ideal time to acknowledge the employers that consistently hire from the military community and offer programs to support veterans and their families.  That's why each November, Victory Media, the publisher of G.I. Jobs, releases its annual list of the 100 most Military Friendly Employers. The ranking, now in its twelfth year, is compiled using results from a comprehensive, data-driven survey among approximately 5,000 companies (a minimum of $500 million in annual revenue was required to be eligible for the list). The survey asked these employers more than 100 questions, which assessed their long-term commitment to recruiting and hiring former military personnel, policies for Reserve/Guard members called to active duty, the presence of special programs, and retention rates. With help from an independent advisory board of industry experts, Victory Media developed the methodology and criteria for the survey, and the results were tested by Ernst &amp; Young. "It’s critical to isolate and distinguish those companies with the strongest job opportunities, hiring practices, and retention programs for transitioning service members and spouses seeking civilian employment so that candidates are able to conduct an efficient and effective job search," says Sean Collins, vice president of Victory Media and a nine-year Navy veteran. "Our list serves as the defacto post-military employment guide for transitioning service members and their families." Combined Insurance Company of America, a frequent top performer with more than 40% of its recent hires representing veterans or military spouses, tops the 2015 list of Military Friendly Employers.  In a press statement released by G.I. Jobs, Brad Bennett, president of Combined Insurance, said that being named the No. 1 military-friendly employer "is a tremendous privilege, and we are honored to be recognized for our initiatives. But more importantly, not only does it mean we are doing things right, it also means we are doing the right things to help our nation's veterans find meaningful employment."

Flickr Europe And Japan Are Still Complete 'Train Wrecks' (Guggenheim Partners) "Japan and Europe remain the train wrecks they were advertised to be. Interestingly, the slowdown in the eurozone is now concentrated at the core rather than on the periphery. As a result, we could soon witness a dramatic shift in the European political dynamic," writes Scott Minerd. Investors should keep this in mind when they're considering the global economy. Even though quantitative easing has ended in the US, a larger, global monetary expansion is far from over, because other central banks will have to pick up the slack. "The sell-off in US high-yield bonds and leveraged bank loans during the third quarter has made for an attractive entry point, and while I expect to see some sort of consolidation in US equities, the near-term risk is that stocks are headed higher," adds Minerd. Investors Want More Regulation So Badly They're Willing To Pay For It (Investment News) A new Finra survey suggests that investors want more regulation in the advisory industry so badly that they're willing pay higher brokerage costs for it. A whopping 92% of investors say it's important to "have a cop on the beat" for protection, and 74% are pro "additional regulatory protections." And on top of that, 56% of respondents want more regulation, even if increased regulation would result in higher fees. Right now, Finra is debating whether to implement a customer-data-collection initiative — CARDS — and the deadline is Dec. 1. "The regulator argues that the system would let it collect reams of brokerage account information quickly and efficiently, bolstering its ability to detect investment product sales abuses and other harmful market trends," reports Mark Schoeff Jr.  Pershing Isn't Liable For Losses Resulting From Allen Stanford's Ponzi Scheme (The Wall Street Journal)  A Finra arbitration panel has ruled that Pershing LLC isn't liable for $80 million in investor losses resulting from Allen Stanford's $7 billion Ponzi scheme, reports Matthias Rieker. Stanford's Ponzi scheme was one of the largest in US history; it collapsed in 2009, and with it went the retirement savings of more than 85 older investors. They sued Pershing, claiming it should have known that Stanford's firm was a fraud, and that Pershing withheld information relevant to the fraud. Dividends Help Clients Cope Materially And Psychologically When Things Get Rough (Financial Planning)  When the markets become volatile, advisers need to get clients to focus on the long-run benefits, rather than the ups-and-downs. One of the best ways to do that is to ask clients to look at dividends. First, dividends help from the psychological point of view. "Because investors who hold dividend-paying equities can look forward to another payment within a few months, they should be more likely to maintain their positions," writes Joseph Lisanti. Additionally, reinvested dividends account for just over 40% of the market's annualized total return starting in 1926 through June 2014.  Investors Need To Capitalize On Oil's Decline (Charles Schwab)  The plunging oil prices have been the story for a while now, and it seems that oversupply and the dollar's strength, rather than a weaker demand, are behind the drop. "The rapid price drop in oil is likely to act as a boost to economic growth. With the amount spent on oil amounting to 4% of world GDP, the global price decline from around $110 in recent years to $80 is about a 27% decline, or more than 1% of world GDP," write Liz Ann Sonders, Brad Sorensen, and Jeffrey Kleintop. Although it doesn't directly translate to a 1% boost in global growth, in the short term there may be some significant moves because consumers will definitely win out here. And investors should capitalize on that.     FREE AppDownload
WIkimedia CommonsS&amp;P 500 companies will pay out $1.1 trillion to investors in the form of stock buybacks and dividends in 2015. This is according to Goldman Sachs' Amanda Sneider. Buybacks will grow 18% next year after a 26% gain in 2014. S&amp;P 500 companies are also expected to increase dividend payouts at a 7% annualized rate through 2017. "Although we expect a gradual shift toward investing for growth via capital expenditures and M&amp;A as confidence in the US economy grows, the popularity of dividends and buybacks should continue, particularly given the risks posed by struggling economies in Europe and Asia," Sneider wrote. We drew on Goldman's "Total Cash Return to Shareholders" basket to highlight the stocks with the largest combined realized buyback and dividend yields. Total yield is calculated as the sum of gross buybacks and dividends as a share of market cap. These 15 stocks have a total yield greater than 14%. Note: they are not intended to serve as a well-diversified portfolio. FREE AppDownload
flickr/Roger PriceStocks hit record highs while gold, oil, and the VIX all fell to start the week. By virtue of closing in positive territory, both the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 made new all-time closing highs. Gold and oil, meanwhile, continued to trade near multi-year lows, while the VIX, which measures expected market volatility, is now down more than 40% in a month. First, the scoreboard: And now, the top stories on Monday: 1. Stocks did it again. Any green close on Monday would have given the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 new all-time highs, and so for the second straight day, we've got new records. Overall, though, nothing too exciting in the market, with NYSE floor governor Rich Barry writing in a midday email that Monday is one of those days where we just had "more buyers than sellers." But aside from the lackluster action on Monday, we're currently witnessing the strongest three-week streak for stocks since October 2011, with both the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 now up more than 7% in just three weeks.  2. We're still a few weeks away from Thanksgiving, but with third quarter earnings mostly in the books, Wall Street strategists are already publishing their outlooks for 2015. At UBS, Julian Emanuel said the S&amp;P 500 looks poised to rise another 14% to 2,225 in 2015, with earnings for the benchmark index set to rise 7% to $126. Emanuel cited strong corporate balance sheets, as well as solid GDP and earnings growth, as key drivers for a likely expansion in stock prices next year. "Roll tide, roll," Emanuel wrote. 3. And while stock prices have risen in recent weeks, not all assets have held up well, particularly oil, gold, and the VIX, which measures stock market volatility. Oil and gold fell more than 1.5% on Monday, bringing these commodities — again — to multi-year lows as gold cracked $1,150 an ounce and oil again fell to near $77. Meanwhile the VIX, which is often called the "fear index" and measures expected stock market volatility, fell nearly 5% on Monday to below 12.5. In the last month, the VIX is down more than 40%.  4. One commodity that hasn't been under pressure of late, however, is cattle. Live-cattle futures last week hit an all-time high on CME, and prices are unlikely to come down anytime soon, Business Insider's Akin Oyedele reports. In addition to increasing demand for beef, a 2011 drought in Texas and Oklahoma dented cattle herds, which has forced farmer to undergo a lengthy cattle replacement process.  5. GoPro shares were down 4% on Monday as the stock was again in focus after the company filed to sell $800 million worth of common stock. Following this disclosure, GoPro CEO Nick Woodman sent an email to GoPro employees explaining the company's motivation for the filing, which was two-fold: to raise $100 million capital for the company and to facilitate a more orderly sale of stock following the end of the company's lock-up expiration. GoPro's lock-up expiration is set to expire in December. In his email, Woodman said that while he will sell a portion of his GoPro holdings, "I plan to be a significant shareholder in GoPro for a long time."  6. Inflows to Janus Capital totaled more than $1 billion in October, the first month that Bill Gross was at the firm after joining from PIMCO, the firm he co-founded in 1971. The Unconstrained Bond Fund, which Gross is managing at Janus, saw more than $360 million in investor inflows in October.  7. McDonald's reported October global same-store sales that fell 0.5%, which was actually better than the 2.2% decline expected by analysts. McDonald's shares finished the day unchanged.  8. In bankruptcy news, biopharmaceutical company Dendreon, which markets cancer vaccine Provenge, saw shares plummet 80% after filing for Chapter 11 protection on Monday. The company said that agreed to terms of a restructuring with certain of its bondholders, and that this may include a standalone recapitalization or a sale of the company's assets.  Don't Miss: A Tiny Firm That Saw The 1929 Crash Coming Sees Trouble For 2015 » FREE AppDownload
Uber CEO Travis Kalanick is getting incredibly rich — at least on paper.  But he wants to get even richer. Uber is seeking an additional $1 billion investment, beyond a big infusion it received as recently as June. "[T]he car-booking company’s co-founder and chief executive officer, is seeking a higher valuation than the $17 billion Uber got," during its last raise, Bloomberg's Serena Saitto reported. Ever since I moved back to New York from Los Angeles several months ago, I've become an avid Uber user. There's no question in my mind that Kalanick and his team have created a great service. Business Insider has been diligent about investigating the issues that have arisen with the company. But the bottom line for me is that I hope Uber sticks around — although I don't want the traditional taxi industry to go away. However, my extremely positive experiences with the company and Kalanick's ideas about valuations are different stories.  It could be that Uber's opponents aren't as much a threat to its existence as are its goals for rapid expansion. It's been noted that Uber's game plan is to effectively ignore whatever legal challenges may eventually be thrown at it in a quest to get big fast and drive its competition out of the game. On the plus side, Uber has defined a need for an alternative to taxis and created a viable market for entrepreneurs who want to do likewise.  On the negative side, I wouldn't want to be going up against Uber. Frankly, Kalanick seems almost like a businessman of the old school — he relishes a good fight and wants to win, all the time, every time. So if Bloomberg's reporting is accurate and Uber is pursuing another billion in investment just a few months after taking $1.2 billion, you have to see where the bets are being placed. In fact, Uber investors are wagering that the company will overcome entrenched resistance to its objectives. Silicon Valley startups have taken a lot of money and satisfied investors in the past — just look at Facebook. But Facebook wasn't under threat of legal action for its business model, nor was it facing organized protests from critics. Uber is a technology company, but it operates in the rough-and-tumble world of big cities, established unions, and the very competitive taxi/car service industry.  There's another factor: the sheer force of Uber's disruption. A lot of tech companies call themselves "disruptive," or say that they're engaged in "disruptive innovation," but what they really are is just plain innovative, in both a beneficial and creative sense.  They're showing a different and better way of doing things, but at the same time they're creating new platforms, new ways to connect — and are removing "friction" from mundane tasks, like paying bills or filing taxes. Uber is doing some of that, too, but it's also drastically re-inventing the way that an important aspect of urban mobility actually works.  The thing is, when you really and truly disrupt established industries, you make enemies. You take their business away, rather than demonstrating a benignly new and different way of doing something that can function alongside the old industry. Or only invalidate the old industry in slow motion, giving everyone who can read the writing on the wall plenty of time to find something else to do. The implication of another billion in investment is that Uber is going to overcome its many challenges and pay off big time at some not-too-distant point. But that implies that all of Uber's enemies are going to surrender en masse. To a degree, anyone putting money into Uber now is betting that the company will become so pervasive — monopolistic, even — that the opposition will decide that resistance is futile. Would you take that bet? Some sophisticated investors are. Uber just goes to show you that real disruption is thrilling — but also scary, particularly if you're the one being disrupted.

"This election is about competence. It truly is about competence," Welch said on CNBC's "Squawk Box." He went on to attack "liberals" in government. "Let me give you a classic example of why we don't have competence. Take New York City," Welch said. The former General Electric CEO proceeded to single out the city's school's chancellor for his criticism. He appeared to cite a report indicating a number of superintendents recently reappointed to their jobs came from underperforming schools. "The chancellor of the school system is named Carmen Fariña. She just appointed 15 superintendents: seven from failing schools, five from disasters — 10% passing tests, et cetera — as superintendents! When you have a philosophy of putting in place people without a meritocracy, without differentiation, you get bad performance," Welch continued. Welch really started getting on a roll when he argued no one in the business world would hire deputies with the same record of success as those school superintendents. "You couldn't run CNBC, you couldn't run GE, you couldn't run Apple, you couldn't run Google, you couldn't run any company if you took seven of your 15 appointments to division managers and made them flunkies, hacks. And you stuck them in the schools, you can't do it. It's that system of no meritocracy, of no differentiation, 'we're all equal,' you don't get performance," he said. "You can't do it. You just can't do it!" Update (5:40 p.m.): Reached for comment, BOE spokeswoman Devora Kaye spoke broadly about Fariña's policies: "Chancellor Fariña is determined to make this the best urban system in the country, bar none, and as a former superintendent, she knows what it takes to hold principals and schools accountable and improve student outcomes. Our current superintendents are the right leaders for these jobs and each has a proven track record as an instructional leader and is committed to working tirelessly to improve the schools they support. These leaders will report to the chancellor and she will hold them accountable." Watch Welch's full comments below.  FREE AppDownload
flickr/Roger PriceStocks hit record highs while gold, oil, and the VIX all fell to start the week. By virtue of closing in positive territory, both the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 made new all-time closing highs. Gold and oil, meanwhile, continued to trade near multi-year lows, while the VIX, which measures expected market volatility, is now down more than 40% in a month. First, the scoreboard: And now, the top stories on Monday: 1. Stocks did it again. Any green close on Monday would have given the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 new all-time highs, and so for the second straight day, we've got new records. Overall, though, nothing too exciting in the market, with NYSE floor governor Rich Barry writing in a midday email that Monday is one of those days where we just had "more buyers than sellers." But aside from the lackluster action on Monday, we're currently witnessing the strongest three-week streak for stocks since October 2011, with both the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 now up more than 7% in just three weeks.  2. We're still a few weeks away from Thanksgiving, but with third quarter earnings mostly in the books, Wall Street strategists are already publishing their outlooks for 2015. At UBS, Julian Emanuel said the S&amp;P 500 looks poised to rise another 14% to 2,225 in 2015, with earnings for the benchmark index set to rise 7% to $126. Emanuel cited strong corporate balance sheets, as well as solid GDP and earnings growth, as key drivers for a likely expansion in stock prices next year. "Roll tide, roll," Emanuel wrote. 3. And while stock prices have risen in recent weeks, not all assets have held up well, particularly oil, gold, and the VIX, which measures stock market volatility. Oil and gold fell more than 1.5% on Monday, bringing these commodities — again — to multi-year lows as gold cracked $1,150 an ounce and oil again fell to near $77. Meanwhile the VIX, which is often called the "fear index" and measures expected stock market volatility, fell nearly 5% on Monday to below 12.5. In the last month, the VIX is down more than 40%.  4. One commodity that hasn't been under pressure of late, however, is cattle. Live-cattle futures last week hit an all-time high on CME, and prices are unlikely to come down anytime soon, Business Insider's Akin Oyedele reports. In addition to increasing demand for beef, a 2011 drought in Texas and Oklahoma dented cattle herds, which has forced farmer to undergo a lengthy cattle replacement process.  5. GoPro shares were down 4% on Monday as the stock was again in focus after the company filed to sell $800 million worth of common stock. Following this disclosure, GoPro CEO Nick Woodman sent an email to GoPro employees explaining the company's motivation for the filing, which was two-fold: to raise $100 million capital for the company and to facilitate a more orderly sale of stock following the end of the company's lock-up expiration. GoPro's lock-up expiration is set to expire in December. In his email, Woodman said that while he will sell a portion of his GoPro holdings, "I plan to be a significant shareholder in GoPro for a long time."  6. Inflows to Janus Capital totaled more than $1 billion in October, the first month that Bill Gross was at the firm after joining from PIMCO, the firm he co-founded in 1971. The Unconstrained Bond Fund, which Gross is managing at Janus, saw more than $360 million in investor inflows in October.  7. McDonald's reported October global same-store sales that fell 0.5%, which was actually better than the 2.2% decline expected by analysts. McDonald's shares finished the day unchanged.  8. In bankruptcy news, biopharmaceutical company Dendreon, which markets cancer vaccine Provenge, saw shares plummet 80% after filing for Chapter 11 protection on Monday. The company said that agreed to terms of a restructuring with certain of its bondholders, and that this may include a standalone recapitalization or a sale of the company's assets.  Don't Miss: A Tiny Firm That Saw The 1929 Crash Coming Sees Trouble For 2015 » FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Rick Wilking To offset losses in the retail department, the company is planning to ramp up e-commerce and make the most of its extensive real-estate properties.  Sears has been leasing store space to other retailers and is considering "spinning off hundreds of its properties as a real estate investment trust," reports Lauren Coleman-Lochner at Bloomberg News.  Selling and then leasing back retail space would be a way for Sears to generate some quick cash, analysts told Bloomberg. The new Aventura mall project illustrates what Sears' new real-estate plan might look like.  Located in South Florida, the new development would be similar to an outdoor mall with retail stores (including Sears), parking, restaurants, a hotel, and offices. Sears provided Business Insider with an image of what the development will look like: Sears HoldingsThe Aventura, Florida, Sears store concept. Sears has 1,800 locations. The new plan would mean that Sears would own 400 to 500 and lease the rest, Bloomberg writes.  It's unclear when the retailer will begin construction on the new mall.  The creative plan bodes well for the retailer's future.  Sears' plan to create a REIT sent shares soaring 31% — the biggest gain in more than a decade.  Despite recent store closures, Sears Holdings, which also includes K-Mart, still has a huge real-estate portfolio. Here's a map showing locations in the US: Morgan Stanley The department store has been bleeding cash, posting its ninth straight quarterly loss in August.  Sears "just doesn’t have the same resonance, it doesn’t have the same level of importance to people as it had 30 years ago," Matt McGinley, managing director at International Strategy &amp; Investment Group, told Bloomberg News. The retailer has also been challenged as Americans move away from traditional shopping malls.      FREE AppDownload

Continental It could've been the most expensive divorce in history, but oil tycoon Harold Hamm will pay his ex-wife Sue Ann only less than $1 billion after 26 years of marriage. Bloomberg ranks Hamm as the 50th richest person in the world, worth $16 billion. He and his wife did not sign a prenuptial agreement when they married. Hamm's company, Continental Resources, owns 1 million acres in North Dakota's Bakken oil field, the shale play that has helped U.S. oil production rise to levels unseen in decades. Hamm owns 68% of the company and has an amazing rags to riches story. We wanted to portray the full life-story of a man who went from pumping gas at a corner store to becoming one of the most influential people in the energy industry.

WEF/F. Alvaredo, A. B. Atkinson, T. Piketty and E. Saez, 2013. ‘The World Top Incomes DatabaseThe World Economic Forum is out with its new Outlook on the Global Agenda 2015. Deepening income inequality tops the list of economic trends to watch, as chosen by WEF's survey respondents (about 1,750 people from a network of "members and alumni of the Global Agenda Councils, as well as Young Global Leaders and Global Shapers"). The US tops the list of most unequal of the world's rich nations, and has surged ahead of the rest mostly in the last 30 years (see the above chart). However, the survey respondents don't think that North America will be the most affected by deepening inequality over the next year. That honor goes to Asia: WEF What should be done about inequality?

Here are the rest of the top trends:  WEF Of note, last year's #1 trend, "rising societal tensions in the Middle East and North Africa" has completely dropped off the list (or, debatably, has been folded into this year's #8, "intensifying nationalism.")

An Oklahoma Judge has handed down the ruling in the most expensive divorce in US history — between billionaire energy magnate Harold Hamm and his ex-wife Sue Ann. CNBC reports that she'll be given less than $1 billion of Hamm's $16 billion fortune. Hamm made his fortune through the oil and gas company he founded in 1967, Continental Resources. He owns 68% of the company.  He met his ex-wife there and she has served as a company attorney and in executives roles at the firm. They were married in 1988 without a prenup — which means Hamm could've had to hand over half his fortune to Sue Ann. The case was strange, not just for its size, but also for how it proceeded. The general counsel of Continental, Eric Eissenstat, had a huge role in the courtroom even though he didn't represent either party. The Judge was so friendly with Eissenstat he would toss him candy during the proceedings. “It sounds like the corporation is part of the divorce case,” said Arnold Rutkin, a lawyer at Rutkin Oldham in Connecticut told Reuters. “There are only two parties in a divorce: husband and wife.”Reuters also reported that Sue Ann's team alleged that Continental intervened in the divorce in Hamm's favor. In part, that means the company downplayed Hamm's role in its success, essentially chalking it up to friendly market conditions rather than his hard work.  In Oklahoma, if lawyers could prove that Continental's stock gains were made due to the market conditions rather than Hamm's leadership, those gains would be off the table in the divorce settlement. The title of "most expensive divorce" in the world goes to Russian oligarch Dmitry Rybolovlev, who paid his wife $4.5 billion. All together Sue Ann will be getting $995.5 million, with a third of that due by the end of the year. The rest will be paid in installments of $7 million a month. FREE AppDownload
Flickr/John TrainorThis has been the best three-week period for stocks since 2011. In his midday market commentary on Monday, New York Stock Exchange floor governor Rich Barry notes that over the last three weeks, the Dow is up 7.3% and the S&amp;P 500 is up 7.7%, the best three-week run for these averages since October 2011. On Monday, stocks were trading higher and making fresh all-time highs, but with no clear catalyst, Barry simply chalked these advances up to there being "more buyers than sellers."  So overall, not much to say about Monday's action. Barry also notes that technically, the market is short-term "overbought," making it not unlikely that stocks could see a bit of a pullback later this week. But there are five fundamental points that Barry says market bulls will cite as a reason for stocks to keep grinding higher: There is also a bit of stock market history on the bulls' side. Barry notes that since 1950, the S&amp;P 500 has average an annualized gain of 13.9% between November and April vs 1.7% between May and October. And as we highlighted earlier on Monday, at least one Wall Street strategist would tend to agree with the bulls here: "Roll Tide, Roll." FREE AppDownload
(Reuters) - Dendreon Corp filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after sales of the world's first cancer vaccine fell short of expectations and left the company deep in debt. Dendreon's shares fell as much as 74.5 percent to 24 cents on Monday following the news, a far cry from their peak of $57.67 in April 2010, after its drug Provenge won US approval. Seattle-based Dendreon said it had agreed terms of a financial restructuring with certain bond holders that may involve a standalone recapitalization or the sale of the company or its assets. After its approval by US regulators in 2010, hopes were high that Provenge, Dendreon's only drug on the market, would become a blockbuster. But adoption of the drug, an injection to reprogram the immune system to attack advanced prostate cancer cells, was hindered by its hefty price tag and uncertainty over insurance coverage. The high cost of manufacturing also hurt margins, while Xtandi, jointly marketed by Medivation Inc and Astellas Pharma Inc, and Johnson &amp; Johnson's Zytiga - both orally administered - emerged as competitors. "The business is fundamentally unprofitable so, without a change to efficiencies in the manufacturing process, it's really difficult to see them coming back as a standalone company," said Wedbush Securities analyst David Nierengarten. The announcement, said Nierengarten, is a cautionary tale for other developers of autologous cell therapies - therapies derived from a person's own cells - which must keep manufacturing costs under control. The emergence of Bavarian Nordic A/S's experimental prostate cancer vaccine - cheaper to manufacture, with a price expected to be in line with rival therapies - could also spell the end of Provenge, he said. Dendreon said senior noteholders would support a plan to convert all 2016 notes to common equity of the reorganized company. Dendreon had $660.7 million in liabilities and $340.3 million in assets as of Sept. 30, according to the court filing. As of Nov. 7, it had $100 million in cash. "With a large debt balance and high management turnover, the writing had been on the wall for some time that this was a possibility," said Cowen and Co analyst Eric Schmidt said. Dendreon Chief Executive W. Thomas Amick said Provenge would remain commercially available throughout the restructuring process. The case is In re: Dendreon Corporation, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware, No. 14-12515.

 Mark Cuban says lots of things that sometimes get him into trouble.  Back in 2002, the Dallas Mavericks owner said he wouldn't hire Ed Rush, the head of NBA officials, to even manage a Dairy Queen.  At the time, lots of people, including Dairy Queen employees, were a bit offended.  And so one Dairy Queen franchisee called Cuban and challenged him to manage a Dairy Queen. Cuban did it, and then he got a thank-you note from one very famous Dairy Queen fan: Warren Buffett.  Dairy Queen is owned by Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. And, according to the New York Post, Buffett is so fond of the chain that he once tried to order a Dairy Queen Blizzard while dining at the Four Seasons.  On this week's "Master in Business" podcast, Cuban told Barry Ritholtz that managing a Dairy Queen after his comments was probably the best PR stunt he's ever done.  Dairy Queen franchisee Parrish Chapman pitched to Cuban this idea of managing a Dairy Queen for the day. Cuban says there was a line outside clammering at 6:30 in the morning on that day. And Cuban said it was Chapman who turned the event into what Cuban called a "circus" that benefitted his business and served as positive PR for Cuban. Since Cuban bought the Dallas Mavericks in 2000, fines levied against him by the NBA have totaled nearly $2 million, according to Sports Illustrated. Each time Cuban is fined by the NBA, he matches that amount with a charitable donation.  Cuban's full discussion with Ritholtz is wide ranging and a must-listen for anybody interested in the billionaire entrepreneur.

In terms of international politics and economics, everything that matters is happening in China this week. Lets talk about politics first. The two-day Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit has been going on since Sunday, and President Obama also heads to the region this week. Already the Summit has made news. Russia and China signed a key energy pact meant to reduce Russia's reliance on European oil and gas demand, and there is word that Chinese President Xi Jinping may have a word with his Japanese counterpart on the sidelines. This is a big deal as the two leaders haven't spoken face to face in two years and just signed a four part pact to cool tensions over disputed islands in the East China Sea. During the opening session of APEC, President Xi made a speech about China's "new normal." For the business leaders in the room that meant two distinct things. First, it was a nod to China's changing business landscape. Chinese regulators have been cracking down on multi-national corporations operating in the country. Companies like GlaxoSmithKline, Daimler, Qualcomm Chrysler and more have been pushed to cut prices and punished with big fines. Surveys by business organizations like the American Chamber of Commerce in Beijing and the U.S.-China Business Council show that foreign business people are increasingly concerned that they are becoming the targets of anti-monopoly campaigns — that the government is strong arming them. In one survey 60% respondents said that they felt foreign business is less welcome in China than it was before. Xi's speech was also an acknowledgment that China's economy is slowing down. In part, he said in his speech, because it needs to be reconstructed into a more stable system. "Resilience best equips the Chinese economy against risks," said Xi. "Given the strategies and policy options at our disposal, we have the confidence and capability to cope with potential risks." That, of course, means getting all the multi-nationals to fall in line with this program (thus the crack down with Chinese characteristics) — one in which the country's growth may be lower but is more reliant on domestic consumption than foreign investment.  As state news agency Xinhua said, the "good old days" are over.  This is where things get messy — that's another thing to watch for this week. A slew of data on the health of the Chinese economy — industrial production, foreign investment, retail sales — and the scope of the slow down is coming out (or has come out already). Xi seems okay with the idea that the country will miss its 7.5% GDP growth target for 2014 — but how much is he comfortable with?  This weekend's data release showed that imports and exports both slowed — exports slowed less than expected, imports slowed more. Xi would've liked those two stats reversed. He wants his people consuming things, which makes the next two data points all the more troubling.  Reuters woman stands next to a miniature replica of the U.S. White House at a theme park called "Window Of The World" in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, October 20, 2014. China's consumer price index and producer price index deflated to 6-year lows, coming in at 1.6% and -2.2.% respectively. It's the low PPI number that is most troubling. It means that already cash strapped, debt laden Chinese companies will continue to suffer from thin margins. "[The]...data confirmed sluggish domestic demand and rising disinflationary risks. We expect continued PPI deflation through 2015 and the government’s latest “going out” efforts to support Asian infrastructure investment offer some solution to the domestic overcapacity issue," Barclays wrote in an analyst note. That "support" came in the form of a minuscule stimulus — a $113 billion infrastructure project. That's a little more than 1% of China's GDP to put it in perspective. So it's nothing, and according to Societe Generale's Wei Yao, even more of that kind of support isn't the answer anyway. "China’s debt problem lies with the corporate sector, and so PPI deflation can cause more damage to debt dynamics than CPI deflation. The cure should be capacity consolidation and debt restructuring, rather thananother stimulus package targeted to boost investment demand," she wrote in a recent note. In other words, the hard work hasn't been done yet. Until it's done, China's at risk. To top all that off, China's Singles' Day, the biggest shopping day of the year anywhere in the world, is on Tuesday. So we'll see how good China's young single adults are to themselves — it could mean a lot for everyone. FREE AppDownload
Across all recorded history, 99% of humanity has never invented a single thing. Yet, it is a truth universally acknowledged that long-run sustained progress in economic well-being arises from human creativity and innovativeness. In this regard, the average human and indeed the great majority of humanity over the last seven million years provide a completely misleading guide to what is possible. Misapplied, the Law of Averages misinforms. This is why, seemingly against all odds, every nation exhorts its people to be creative and innovative. It is why, apparently against all common sense, every country wants to claim Nobel Prizes for its citizens. Now and then a place as unlikely as Cyprus triumphs. For human success the average is not at all informative as an indicator of what is possible. Otherwise, humanity would still be where it was 7 million years ago. Yet, when we contemplate the economic success of nations we are easily tempted to fall back on what we know about the average of nations: China cannot keep growing at better than 6% a year because no other country has for as long. For at least two reasons, we should resist that seductive appeal. First, success is, as just-described, necessarily different from the norm. The average or even the great mass of the distribution of people or of nations simply isn’t revealing as a guide to what can happen. Second, perhaps even the typically-regarded growth decelerations and crashes in the data samples we do consider aren’t really failures after all. Singapore, in one of the most spectacular of economic accelerations, saw its per capita GDP grow at over 6% per annum for over a decade. But Lant Pritchett and Larry Summers (Asiaphoria Meets Regression to the Mean, 2014) document how after 1980 Singapore’s growth rate plummeted to a figure 4 percentage points lower than during that period of success. They note that Taipei,China and the Republic of Korea displayed similar trajectories. All these economies saw a growth spurt. Then they all crashed. The theme that Singapore’s growth trajectory is fraught with imminent failure is of course long-standing. Twenty years ago this year, soon after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Singapore was the target when the world’s most influential economist wrote: “From the perspective of year 2010, current projections of Asian supremacy extrapolated from recent trends may well look almost as silly as 1960s-vintage forecasts of Soviet industrial supremacy did from the perspective of the Brezhnev years.” Pritchett and Summers use these examples to draw a salutary lesson on how China’s economy to date has already massively defied the statistical odds. It cannot continue to do so. The harsh reality of statistics alone tells us China will almost surely crash as well. But if China were to go the same way, would that be so awful?  What has actually been achieved by the abortive runs of economic over-heating in Singapore and other East Asian false miracles? In the first half of the 1960s Singapore’s per capita GDP amounted to 16% of the US’s; Taipei,China, 13% of the US; Korea, 7%. The graph shows what unfolded in the PWT8.0 data typically used to study cross-country statistical regression to the mean. By 2007-2011 the US economy was, obviously, seeing dramatic slowdown from the Global Financial Crisis. But then so were all other economies. Indeed, throughout this period pretty much all economies rose, fell, grew fast, and slowed dramatically in turn. Fluctuations are a fact of economic life. What happened by the end? Averaged over the last 5 years of the sample Singapore’s per capita GDP had grown to 116% that of the US; that of Taipei,China, to 65% of the US; Korea, 62% of the US. Even before the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, Singapore had already overtaken the US. Perhaps looking at growth accelerations and sudden slowdowns isn’t informative for the economic question that really matters: How have varying patterns of economic growth advanced a nation’s well-being longer-term? Statistically-defined growth decelerations certainly featured in the growth trajectories of Singapore and other East Asian economies. But does that mean those economies have failed?  No. This is not to under-estimate the significant political and social problems now emerging in the fabric of Singapore society. Inequality is high. The historical social compact between the population and the ruling party badly needs updating. But all that textured variety of economic and political life is not the principal contention here. Interest lies simply in the statistical behaviour of measured per capita GDP. Today China’s population is 4.3 times that of the US. Even if that ratio declines to 4 and China grows only as Korea has done, China’s economy will within decades be 2.5 times that of the US. If China grows as Singapore, its economy will be 4.5 times the US’s. China might of course do even better than all these others in the future.  But to succeed perhaps all that China really needs to do is to fail as spectacularly as Singapore. FREE AppDownload
There are less than two months left in 2014, which means one thing for Wall Street strategists: it's time for their 2015 forecasts. First up is UBS strategist Julian Emanuel. The targets: 2,225 on the S&amp;P 500 with earnings per share of $126. In other words, Emanuel is looking for another 14% rise in the S&amp;P 500 index with earnings expected to climb another 7%.  "Roll tide, roll," he says. From Emanuel's note: "The S&amp;P 500 has risen 200% since the bull market began in March 2009 — not unprecedented by historical standards. Buoyed by strong corporate balance sheets positioned to drive further M&amp;A, the prospect of solid GDP anchoring steady earnings growth, and a Fed set to raise interest rates while mindful of incoming data, we expect the advancing tide to continue rolling. We forecast a 2015 year-end S&amp;P 500 price of 2,225 on the back of earnings growth and modest multiple expansion, typical in a maturing rally." Emanuel's forecast has a risk range of 1,750 on the downside to 2,400 on the upside. Concerns over the health of the Chinese and European economies predominate the downside risks, while household debt decreases and net worth increases provide what Emanuel calls "dry powder" for individual investors on the upside.  Regarding the volatility seen in October, Emanuel writes that rising risk is, "perfectly normal at this point in the market cycle where the rally is maturing" and says volatility spikes in 2015 should provide added opportunities for alpha generation. As for what is likely to drive equity gains, Emanuel cites strong payroll growth and steadily rising consumer confidence as two key drivers of the rise expected during 2015. UBS UBS Overall, Emanuel writes that barring an unforeseen shock or a recession, "traditionally one of the two primary threats to a bull market is not on the horizon." And so while plenty of time remains in 2014, Wall Street has begun to look ahead, and at least one analyst thinks things are also looking up for next year.  FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersTo match Special Report SEC/INVESTIGATIONSBy John McCrank NEW YORK (Reuters) - Regulators are undertaking a comprehensive data-driven review of the rules underpinning the U.S. equity markets, including the pricing and rebate system used by exchanges, the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission said on Monday. The SEC is looking at its National Market System rule set, as well as the role of exchanges acting as self-regulated organizations, to see if adjustments should be made to help reduce complexity, improve transparency and make the markets more robust, said SEC Chair Mary Jo White. One of the issues that the regulator is looking at is the "maker-taker" model of fee-based incentives used by many exchanges to attract traders. In that system, brokerages earn rebates by sending in resting orders to bring more liquidity, and must pay fees if they take away liquidity through orders that can be executed immediately. But critics argue that maker-taker pricing distorts stock order routing practices. "Maker taker is one of the issues we've heard a lot about," White said at the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association's annual meeting. "It's clearly an important priority as we're going through this review, but again, we want to be data-driven and be right about whatever adjustments that we make." She also said that the SEC plans to finalize, possibly by year-end, a new rule known as Regulation Systems Compliance and Integrity, which focuses on strengthening exchanges and certain "dark pool" trading venues against technology failures and cyber attacks. That rule was proposed following a raft of high-profile technology snafus in recent years, including the botched initial public offering of Facebook Inc  by exchange operator Nasdaq OMX Group  and the near collapse of Knight Capital, now part of KCG Holdings , after it suffered a $461 million trading error. "You never get to a point where you sort of declare 'mission accomplished,'" White said. "The markets have evolved and continue to evolve and technology is continuing to evolve, and so it is a process to enhance the resiliency and robustness of the market."

Former Bank of England economist Tony Yates, who's now a researcher at the University of Bristol, thinks the eurozone might have already fallen into deflation. He has previously blogged on the evidence that inflation is systematically overestimated by statistical authorities.  A range of different studies that Yates mentions suggest inflation is repeatedly exaggerated upwards, especially in Europe. Mark Wynne at the Dallas Fed estimated in 2005 that there could be "an upward bias of between 1.0 and 1.5 percentage points per annum on average". That might not sound like a lot, but with inflation currently at just 0.4% in the eurozone, even a small downward adjustment would put the currency union in deflation, with prices actually falling. A 1.5 percentage point shift would put the true rate at -1.1%, and mean the continent dropped into negative territory way back in summer 2013.  This all sounds a bit terrifying: the four big central banks in advanced economies all target 2% inflation, so investors interpret a big difference between say, 3% and 1.5% inflation. But a lot of economists think that difference could just be down to statistical measurement problems.  There are some huge problems when an economy suffers from deflation. Demand falls off and growth comes to a halt as consumers think, why buy something today when it will be cheaper tomorrow? But whether the true rate in the eurozone is just extremely low, or actually falling, might not matter too much. Dean Baker at the Center for Economic and Policy Research has made a similar point before: deflation isn't a chimera. Low and falling inflation has the same effect as deflation, just in a slightly more muted way: FREE AppDownload

REUTERS/Chip EastBillionaire John Paulson's event-driven fund is in trouble after posting a 14 percent loss in October, according to a Bloomberg report. The event fund makes up about 16 percent of Paulson &amp; Co, which is down 25 percent this year, the report said. October was a particularly rough month for the man who called the subprime mortgage bubble in 2007. His shares in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac dropped, and Shire PLC, in which he's a major investor, did a nosedive after a potential merger with Abbvie Inc. collapsed. To be fair, last month was tough for a lot of investors. Bloomberg reported that hedge funds on average fell 0.3 percent in October on lower oil prices, global growth worries, and PIMCO co-founder Bill Gross' surprise resignation. But the bad times might not be over for Paulson. Last week, Genworth, another favorite of Paulson's, dropped 36.1 percent. FREE AppDownload

Andrew Burton/GettyGoPro CEO Nick Woodman.GoPro this morning filed to sell $800 million of stock.  Following this disclosure, the company's CEO Nick Woodman sent an email to employees giving more color on why the company is selling stock, and outlining his intentions as a GoPro shareholder. "I plan to sell a portion of my holdings in GoPro, but no one should misunderstand my commitment to the company or our vision," Woodman wrote. "As I told investors on our earnings call last week, I plan to be a significant shareholder in GoPro for a long time. I’m a huge believer in our vision and our ability to realize it." Woodman also listed the company's two main goals with this offering: getting $100 million of new capital for the company, and facilitating a more orderly sale of stock following the end of its lock-up expiration. After a company goes public, there is a period, typically 180 days, during which company insiders can't sell shares. When this period ends, a bunch of new stock is eligible to hit the market, potentially leading to a decline in the share price as this new stock "dilutes the float," or reduces potential earnings per share.  Back in early October, shares of GoPro sold off after the company's founders reached an agreement with JPMorgan to break the lock-up restriction in order to gift shares to a charitable trust.  Following that news, CNBC's Scott Wapner reported that Woodman was, "disappointed his generosity [was] being misconstrued and misinterpreted."  And with GoPro's lock-up restriction set to end on December 22, it seems the company is making sure it is clear with the market regarding its plans this time around.  Here's the full email from Woodman to GoPro employees: This morning, GoPro filed documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission outlining our plans to conduct a 'follow-on and secondary' offering of our stock. This is a relatively common occurrence following an IPO – it allows the company to raise additional capital while providing our early investors and employees with vested options the opportunity to realize a return on their hard work and dedication to GoPro. While all permanent, full-time employees receive equity compensation, only those holding vested options and shares can participate in this particular event. This follow-on offering provides two key benefits: First, we expect to raise approximately $100 million of new capital for the company which will provide us with additional resources to invest in people, products, potential acquisitions, and infrastructure to help us achieve our long-term vision. Second, this offering is intended to facilitate a more orderly and gradual sale of shares than what might otherwise occur when the IPO lock-up ends on December 22. Our goal is to reduce the impact that the IPO lock-up expiration may have on our stock price. To help further this goal, larger shareholders that participate in this offering will be signing a new 90-day lock-up agreement. I plan to sell a portion of my holdings in GoPro, but no one should misunderstand my commitment to the company or our vision. As I told investors on our earnings call last week, I plan to be a significant shareholder in GoPro for a long time. I’m a huge believer in our vision and our ability to realize it. Thanks for continuing to make our vision for GoPro a reality, team. The passion, experience and execution that we bring to work is what makes all of this possible. It’s the reason why the world believes in us. I’m throwing out a huge hug, Hi5 and thank you for making GoPro the incredible company that it is. FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersRussian 1000-rouble banknotes, 50 and 10 kopeck coins are seen at a private company's office in KrasnoyarskBy Alexander Winning and Oksana Kobzeva MOSCOW (Reuters) - Many Russians are buying dollars and hoarding cash, increasingly concerned by a slide in the rouble and wary of possible restrictions on bank withdrawals as President Vladimir Putin blames currency woes on speculators and the West. While there is little panic on the streets of Moscow and other major cities, some Russians are taking no chances with their money, with many hardened by a financial crisis in 1998 which wiped out the savings of millions of people. The rouble  has fallen more than 25 percent against the dollar in 2014, with especially heavy losses in the past month when the currency repeatedly hit all-time lows despite the central bank spending around $30 billion to defend the currency. Financial officials and the Kremlin have united in calling for calm, suggesting that speculators were to blame for the falling rouble, rather than tumbling oil prices or Western sanctions that have weakened the economy. Putin has hinted that the global oil price has been deliberately manipulated to hurt Russia. Russian search engine Yandex said queries such as "what to do with roubles in 2015?" hit a record high of over 1.2 million on one day last week. Viktoria Openko, deputy head of currency conversion operations at mid-sized Russian lender B&amp;N Bank, said demand for dollars had risen more than four times in Moscow from Oct. 9 compared with the preceding two months and the bank had to increase the number of times it restocked its branches. "We first noticed increased demand in Moscow on Oct. 8-9, when the dollar repeatedly started to trade above 40 roubles," she said. "In the regions, the rise in demand started later, from Oct. 13, and on a lesser scale." Representatives from VTB 24, the retail-banking arm of Russia's second-largest lender VTB , and Rosbank, part of Societe Generale Group , have seen a similar increase in forex demand. Another mid-sized Russian lender, Soyuz, said it sold $2.3 million in dollars to customers in October, compared with $890,000 in September.  FLIGHT TO SAFETY So far there are few signs large banks are running short of dollars, but media have reported foreign currency shortages at smaller lenders in the past week. Four large banks were able to sell up to $10,000 to a Reuters reporter on Friday, while an office of sanctioned SMP Bank had large amounts of dollars but had run out of euros. At a currency exchange booth in Moscow, an employee who did not wish to be named said customer behavior had changed. "We have the same customers ringing up in the morning to check the rate. People are worried," the employee said. Bella Zlatkis, deputy chief executive of top lender Sberbank , said late last month that demand for safety deposit boxes was the most noticeable change in customer behavior. "We can't buy safes quickly enough, the largest demand we have is for safes. I understand when people want to put dollars in safes, but at the moment there is another trend, to take out roubles and put them in a safe," Zlatkis said. She suggested demand for safes was linked to fears that authorities could restrict bank withdrawals. "The No. 1 motivation is to save so they can't take it from you." On Monday, the rouble firmed sharply after Putin said he hoped speculative trading on the rouble would stop soon. By mid-afternoon it was trading more than 2 percent higher than the previous close after the central bank said it could intervene at any time to punish speculators after letting the currency float freely. "That Russian officials from the president down are trying to talk up the rouble speaks volumes about the extent of the deterioration in sentiment toward  the currency," said Nicholas Spiro, managing director of Spiro Sovereign Strategy. "While there has been no widespread dollarisation of retail deposits, this is now a much bigger risk than it was as recently as a couple of weeks ago," Spiro said. "Today's recovery in the rouble looks and feels like a temporary respite."

Bridgewater Associates is the largest hedge fund in the world, with $160 billion in assets. To keep it running smoothly, its billionaire founder, Ray Dalio, gives his more than 1,300 employees a 123-page manual on his 210 leadership principles. It's just one of the quirks of working at Bridgewater's Connecticut office, which features a culture of what Dalio calls "radical transparency." All meetings and interviews at Bridgewater are taped, and employees of all levels are encouraged to voice criticism of their colleagues and superiors if the situation calls for it. Dalio's approach may be considered odd by some, but it has also been incredibly effective. One of his key management principles regards how to avoid one of the most common problems bosses in every industry deal with — micromanaging. Here's how he differentiates micromanaging from effective leadership in his manual: Micromanaging is telling the people who work for you exactly what tasks to do and/or doing their tasks for them. Not managing is having them do their jobs without your oversight and involvement. Managing means: 1) understanding how well your people and designs are operating to achieve your goals, and 2) constantly improving them. To be successful, you need to manage. Dalio writes that managers need to see their teams as machines they've designed to achieve managers' goals. This means hiring people who share your values and vision so that you can work alongside them rather than domineering over them. Dalio likens the relationship to teaching someone to ski: Like a ski instructor, you need to have close contact with your people on the slopes so that you can assess their strengths and weaknesses as they are doing their jobs. There should be a good back and forth with trial and error. With time you will be able to decide what they can and can't effectively handle on their own. Bridgewater AssociatesRun your team like a machine.Dalio writes that another symptom of micromanagement is treating problems that arise in your team on a "task-by-task" basis. That is, if your employee's output doesn't meet your expectation, then you should not focus only on how that specific problem can be addressed, he says, but consider it from a "machine" perspective. Discuss with your employee what the problem is rooted in, whether it's a bad habit or a misunderstanding of team goals. There's less of a chance the problem will arise in a similar form if you can get your employees to recognize how they need to change their behavior. Ultimately, the key to avoiding micromanaging is choosing to communicate rather than order. "We want people who know that if the community works well, it will be good for them. We don't want people who need to be ordered and threatened. We don't want people who just follow orders," Dalio says. FREE AppDownload
Ireland wants to help CNBC's Joe Kernen and any other journalist who might be confused by the country's political system. According to the New York Post, the country's government has announced a free expansion of its educational program for those abroad interested in business in Ireland. It's called the Irish Executive Mentoring Program, and a spokesman told The Post that Kernen should definitely apply. This comes after a disastrous live interview on CNBC's "Squawk Box" last week, when host Kernen seemed perplexed to find out that Ireland was part of the EU. Kernen was interviewing Martin Shanahan of Ireland’s Industrial Development Authority (IDA). Cohost Becky Quick asked Shanahan how a weaker euro was affecting Irish tourism; Kernen thought Ireland was still using the pound. Joe Kernen: You have pounds anyway, don't you still? Martin Shanahan: We have euros. JK: You have euros in Ireland? Why do you have euros in Ireland?  MT: Why wouldn't we have euros? JK: I'd use the pound. Ireland entered the euro in 1999. So it's been a while. The exchange went on, and Kernen continued to show a not quite nuanced understanding of Ireland's history. Quick and cohost Andrew Ross Sorkin sat in silence, doubtless wishing that the earth would open up and eat them: JK: What about Scotland? I was using Scottish ... er ...  MT: Scottish pounds. They use sterling. But we use euro. JK: What? MT: Why wouldn't we do that?  JK: Why didn't Scotland? MT: Well, they're part of the UK and we're not.

Reuters/Steven ShiFireworks explode over the Shanghai World Expo in 2010A long-awaited trading link between Hong Kong and Shanghai will launch on Nov. 17, a crucial step towards opening China's capital markets that will give foreign and Chinese individual investors unprecedented access to each others' stock exchanges. The announcement by Hong Kong and Chinese regulators on Monday comes as China is making a big push to widen the use of the yuan, with Canada and Malaysia becoming the latest addition to a growing list of trading hubs for the currency. The so-called Stock Connect trading scheme could boost the average daily value of stock trading in Hong Kong by about 38 percent by 2015, French bank BNP Paribas estimates, and may ultimately lead to the creation of the world's third largest stock exchange. The project will at the same time provide a channel for Chinese savers to start moving some of the $8 trillion of private wealth currently in deposits into overseas stocks. "This marks an important milestone in the liberalization of the mainland's capital account," said Hong Kong Monetary Authority CEO Norman Chan. "It will also propel the development of offshore renminbi business in Hong Kong to new heights." Chinese markets rallied as the launch date was announced. The Stock Connect program was originally expected to launch on Oct. 27, but that unofficial deadline passed, leading to speculation that the program might be held up by technical or political hurdles. Hong Kong's leader CY Leung hinted last week the recent pro-democracy protests in the city had played a role in the delay. Industry participants had also said uncertainty over the taxation of capital gains was a possible sticking point. Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd. &lt;0388.HK&gt; CEO Charles Li said on Monday the tax regime for the trading link would be announced before the launch next week. "I wouldn't waste time agonizing about it," he told reporters. If the two stock markets become further integrated, they would form the world's third-largest equity market with a $5.6 trillion capitalization, according to Allianz Global Investors. China already operates several cross-border investment schemes but these are restricted to specific firms that must apply for a license to participate. Giving foreigners easier access to Chinese stocks could provide support for an ongoing stock market rally and liquidity to upcoming Chinese stock market listings. Chinese stocks have been among the world's worst-performing in recent years, down nearly 25 percent from five years ago. But they have been rallying since summer and look set to post their best annual performance since 2009. The Shanghai Stock Exchange said on Monday regulators are ready to experiment with resuming same-day settlement for stocks after a long freeze, a move that would put Hong Kong and mainland Chinese exchanges on the same settlement regime and eliminate a big operational mismatch.

Neilson Barnard/GettyBeef demand is soaring.Meat lovers want more beef than cattle farmers can produce. Last week, live-cattle futures at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange hit an all-time high of $1.705 a pound. And this year, real per capita expenditure for beef – a measure of demand – is up 5.2% from a year ago, and 9.1% more than any of the last five years, according to Steve Meyer, president of Paragon Economics.  When futures prices increase, consumers feel the pinch a lot more than when they go down, Meyer said. "If you want beef, you're going to continue to pay these kinds of high prices," Meyer told Business Insider.  This chart shows how demand in 2014 has surged above previous years on a constant dollar basis.Paragon Economics, Inc. using USDA and Dept. of Commerce data On why there's more demand, Meyer said, "We've seen this really happening over the last two years as people said 'meat is not as bad for me as they once told me it was'," adding that this, "has benefitted the red meats more than it has poultry and turkey."  Consumption of the four major meats – beef, pork, chicken and turkey – is up 8% from last year. The supply side of the equation tells another story that is not great news for meat lovers. Cow herds fell in 2011 because of droughts that hit Texas and Oklahoma, which account for over 25% of all US beef production. The weather is much more favorable now, but Meyer said farmers are undergoing a lengthy cattle replacement process, which involves taking female cows out of the beef supply to breed, thereby reducing supply available to grocery stores. It takes about two years to get any beef from heifers that are retained, Meyer said, and the process just really kicked in this year. So with tight supply and soaring demand, expect higher beef prices to persist over the next several months. FREE AppDownload
Reuters Called Singles' Day, the anti-Valentine's Day holiday emerged in China two decades ago as a time for bachelors and bachelorettes to celebrate the single life. Since then, Alibaba — China's largest e-commerce company — has turned it into the greatest 24-hour cyberspending blitz in the world by offering deep discounts on everything from cars to clothes. Sales on Singles' Day last year for Alibaba totaled $5.8 billion, up from $3.1 billion the previous year. By comparison, American consumers spent a total of $2.9 billion last year on Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined, the largest online sales days in the US. Alibaba's Singles' Day sales this year are expected to reach more than $8 billion, CNBC reports. Here's a look at how much sales have grown for Alibaba's two e-commerce sites, Tmall and Taobao Marketplace, on Singles' Day over the years, according to TechInAsia.  TechInAsia.com Last year, the websites were offering 50% discounts on items like boyfriend body pillows and hoodies that read "I am single because I am fat." Bargain hunters could also find deep discounts on crystal chandeliers, French wines, and even BMWs.  The holiday hasn't always been about shopping. Five years ago, only about two dozen companies were offering discounts on Singles' Day, also known as "Double 11." ReutersEmployees sort packages at a hub of an express delivery company in Nantong, Jiangsu province, following Singles Day in 2012. American retailers planning to participate in this year's sales include Tesla and the apparel company Zara, according to Businessweek.     FREE AppDownload
After Bill Gross joined Janus Capital, more than $1 billion in client money flowed to the firm. According to a report from Bloomberg's Mary Childs, investors poured about $364 million of that money specifically into Janus' Global Unconstrained Bond Fund, which is managed by Gross, in October. As of September 30, data from Janus shows that assets under management in Janus' Unconstrained Fund were about $79 million. In other words, the Unconstrained Bond Fund more than quintupled after Gross took over. Bloomberg's report on inflows to Janus follows news last week that $27.5 billion left PIMCO's Total Return Fund in October, which was formerly managed by Gross. Gross co-founded PIMCO in 1971.  In its latest 10-Q filed with the SEC, Janus disclosed that it invested $100 million the Unconstrained Fund in October in conjunction with Gross' hiring.  Last week, Bill Gross also released his latest investment outlook, in which he called himself a "philosophical nomad disguised in Western clothing, a wondering drifter, masquerading in a suit near a California beach."  In October, shares of Janus gained 3%. Since news broke on September 26 that Gross would join the firm, Janus shares are up better than 35%.  FREE AppDownload
A small firm that predicted the market crash back in 1929 is back with an ominous message. According to Bloomberg, the Jerome Levy Forecasting Center sees a 65% chance of a recession in 2015. "Clearly the direction of most of the recent global economic news suggest movement toward a 2015 downturn," said David Levy, the chairman of the Jerome Levy Forecasting Center. Levy's forecasts contrasts with the consensus of Wall Street, which is confident that growth will continue for years. Back in 1929, Jerome Levy — grandfather of the current chairman — "didn't like what he saw in his analysis of corporate profits" and rather impressively "sold his stocks before the October crash," reports Bloomberg. More recently, the group warned that the housing bubble and proliferation of subprime debt would be responsible for the last downturn. This time around, David Levy is worried about 2015 because the US is significantly involvement overseas, where growth is slowing. Furthermore, he is concerned that an unusually high proportion of disposable income is exposed to the stock market. To read the full Bloomberg article, click here. FREE AppDownload
GoPro shares were down as much as 5% in premarket trade on Monday after the company filed to sell hundreds of millions of dollars in stock. In an SEC filing early Monday, GoPro filed an S-1 registering the sale of up to $800 million worth of stock. Sale of the stock is no certainty, and the filing doesn't obligate GoPro to sell this stock within a certain timeframe, but the company now has the right to issue up to $800 million in stock into the market. The simple reason that stocks tend to fall when companies announce that they will issue shares is that the offering "dilutes the float."  By offering more stock into the market, the denominator by which the company's earnings is divided increases, thus the earnings per share declines. So if you're valuing a stock based on its multiple to the company's earnings, more stock equals less earnings and therefore warrants a lower share price.  GoPro's filing on Monday doesn't give too many details about when the company might offer shares, though the company did say that it would not receive any proceeds from the offering, and so it could be related to the lock-up expiration following the company's IPO. The lock-up period is a length of time, typically 180 days, following a company's IPO that prevents certain company insiders from selling their shares into the market.  In premarket trade Monday, GoPro shares were sitting near $75; shares priced at $24 ahead of GoPro's IPO.  FREE AppDownload
APMcDonald's October same-store sales topped analysts expectations as declines slowed in the US. Global sales at stores open at least 13 months fell 0.5%, the company reported Monday. Analysts had expected a 2.2% drop. In the US, same-store sales declined 1.1%, which was an improvement from September's 4.1% decrease. The better-than-expected results are likely due to a boost from McDonald's monopoly promotion, which the company brought back at the beginning of last month.  "Today's consumers increasingly prefer customizable food options, dining in a contemporary, inviting atmosphere, and using more convenient ways to order and pay for their meals," McDonald's president and CEO Don Thompson said in a statement. "Although October results reflect our current business challenges, we are moving with a sense of urgency to improve the trajectory of our financial performance while taking the actions necessary to pursue the brand's long-term potential." Global comparable sales fell 0.7% in Europe for the month and 4.2% in the Asia/Pacific, Middle East, and Africa region. The company recorded a 3.3% drop in global same-store sales in the third quarter. FREE AppDownload
Flickr/Jerzy DurczakLet's take a close look at last week's employment report numbers on Full and Part-Time Employment. Buried near the bottom of Table A-9 of the government's Employment Situation Summary are the numbers for Full- and Part-Time Workers, with 35-or-more hours as the arbitrary divide between the two categories. The focus is on total hours worked: Full-time status may result from multiple part-time jobs. The Labor Department has been collecting this since 1968, a time when only 13.5% of US employees were part-timers. That number peaked at 20.1% in January 2010. The latest data point, over four-and-a-half years later, is only modestly lower at 18.8% last month. If the pre-recession percentage is a recovery target, we still have a long way to go. Here is a visualization of the trend in the 21st century, with the percentage of full-time employed on the left axis and the part-time employed on the right. We see a conspicuous crossover during Great Recession.  The Impact of the Great Recession Here is a closer look since 2007. The reversal began in 2008, but it accelerated in the Fall of that year following the September 15th bankruptcy of Lehmann Brothers. In this seasonally adjusted data the reversal peaked in January of 2010.  The two charts above are seasonally adjusted and include the entire workforce, which the CPS defines as age 16 and over. A problem inherent in using this broadest of cohorts is that it includes the population that adds substantial summertime volatility to the full-time/part-time ratio, namely, high school and college students. Also the 55-plus cohort includes a subset of employees that opt for part-time employment during the decade following the historical peak spending years (ages 45-54) and as a transition toward retirement. Change in the Core Workforce, Ages 25-54 The next chart better illustrates summertime volatility by focusing on the change since 2007 in full- and part-time employment for the 25-54 workforce. Note that the government's full-time/part-time data for this cohort is only available as non-seasonally adjusted. To help us recognize the summer seasonality, I've used a lighter color for the June-July-August markers, which are the most subject to temporary shifts from part-time to 35-plus hours of employment. I've also included 12-month moving averages for the two series to help us identify the slope of the trend in recent years.  Like the 16-and-over version, this chart depicts a current situation that is considerably different from the era before the Financial Crisis, although the trend has been slowly improving since early 2010, as illustrated by the dotted-line moving averages. In this is non-seasonally adjusted data, the summer months are obvious outliers, with full-time employment spiking during the June-August period. Obamacare and Part-Time Employment Over the past two years many have speculated that the Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare) has played a role in company decisions about full-time versus part-time employment. The $2,000 per employee penalty for companies that do not comply with regulations has influenced some to rethink their employment policies. In July 2013 the government pushed the start of the penalty from January 2014 to January 2015. But the anticipation of the penalty, even though delayed a year, may influence the decisions of private employers. With regard to Obamacare and part-time employment, as I've repeatedly emphasized: The surge in part-time employment was triggered by the recession, not by the Affordable Care Act, as the next chart clearly illustrates.  Click for a larger image The Bureau of Labor Statistics' monthly employment report is a hodgepodge of data. The full-time/part-time ratio is but a tiny piece of the whole, and the magic 35-hour threshold is arguably arbitrary. But this is, nevertheless, a metric that bears close watching as we try to understand where the economy is headed. The question is whether the ratio shift is to some extent a structural change initially triggered by the Great Recession but now driven by a combination of several factors, not least of which are workplace demographics and ongoing increases in technology-driven productivity with less dependence on human workforce participation.

© AFP/File Philippe LopezA British banker charged with the grisly murders of two women in Hong Kong's Wanchai district (pictured) has had his case adjourned for psychiatric reportsHong Kong (AFP) - A British banker charged with the grisly murders of two women had his case adjourned by a Hong Kong court on Monday for two weeks of psychiatric reports. Rurik Jutting, a 29-year-old securities trader who until recently worked at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, is accused of killing two young Indonesian women whose mutilated bodies were found at his upmarket apartment in the southern Chinese city. The case was "adjourned... for two psychiatric reports on the defendant's fitness to plead", said principal magistrate Bina Chainrai. Jutting, who was in court Monday, will be remanded in custody and will next appear on November 24, Chainrai said. Bearded and wearing black-rimmed glasses, Jutting remained impassive during the brief hearing at Hong Kong's Eastern Magistrate's court -- his second appearance after being charged with the murders a week ago.  He spoke only once to say: "I do" when the magistrate asked him whether he understood the arrangements.  Prosecutor Louise Wong told the court that a reconstruction of the crime "has not yet been conducted because the defendant did not give consent". Defence lawyer Tim Parker said that Jutting had not agreed to a reconstruction "yet" -- but may do in future. Parker also applied to obtain video recordings of interviews police had conducted with Jutting.  The bodies of Seneng Mujiasih and Sumarti Ningsih, both Indonesian and in their 20s, were discovered after Jutting called police to his flat in the city's Wanchai neighbourhood in the early hours of November 1.  Seneng was found naked in the living room, with knife wounds to her neck and buttocks. Sumarti's decaying body was found hours later by police, stuffed into a suitcase on the apartment's balcony. According to court documents, she was killed days earlier, on October 27. Police are investigating whether the victims were sex workers.  Wanchai is known for its late-night drinking holes popular with expatriate revellers, and is home to a thriving red light district. High-flyer Jutting was a pupil at the exclusive English boarding school Winchester College before studying history and law at Cambridge University. On October 27 he posted on his Facebook page that he was embarking on a "new journey".  "Stepping down from the ledge. Burden lifted; new journey begins. Scared and anxious but also excited. The first step is always the hardest," he wrote. On that same date, his licence from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority for dealing in and advising on securities was cancelled, according to its website. Jutting's three licences for dealing in securities and futures contracts with the city's Securities and Futures Commission also ended on October 28, according to its website.    FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersA Toll Brothers home under construction is seen in Broomfield(Reuters) - Toll Brothers Inc , the largest U.S. luxury homebuilder, reported a 29 percent jump in quarterly revenue after it sold more homes at higher prices as housing demand strengthened. The company's shares rose 1.5 percent to $32.69 in premarket trading after it also said orders jumped in terms of both dollars and units for the first time in four quarters. "We are pleased with our strong finish to fiscal year 2014 and, given the fourth quarter's improvement in demand, begin fiscal year 2015 with optimism," Chief Executive Douglas Yearley said in a statement on Monday. The U.S. housing market recovery that began about four years ago sputtered in the first eight months of 2014 as soaring home prices and rising interest rates dampened demand. The latest housing data, however, shows that the market could be picking up again. New home starts rose 6.3 percent to a 1.02 million-unit annual pace in September, after a 14.4 percent fall in August, Commerce Department data showed. Toll Brothers said the number of homes it finished rose 22 percent to 1,807 in the fourth quarter ended Oct. 31, while the average selling price rose 6.3 percent to $747,000 from a year earlier. New contracts increased 10 percent to 1,282 homes, while the value of the contracts jumped 16 percent to $970.2 million. Total revenue rose to $1.35 billion from $1.04 billion. Toll Brother's shares closed at $32.22 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday. Up to Friday's close, the stock had risen about 1 percent in the past 12 months, while the Dow Jones U.S. home construction index  increased 21 percent.

Standard & Poor's Corporation Last week, I observed that the one-year periods following mid-term congressional elections and third years of presidential terms have been consistently very bullish for stocks. A few of our accounts reminded me that years ending in “5” have also been consistently very positive ones for stocks. Let’s review these cycles:  (1) Mid-term elections. Last Monday, I noted that our analysis of mid-term elections found that since 1942, the S&amp;P 500 rose on average by 8.5% for the subsequent three-month periods, 15.0% for six months, and 15.6% for 12 months. There was only one out of the 45 periods that was down, and just for three months! One has to go back to Depression-era market losses to find two periods when this indicator did not give consistently positive results.  (2) Presidential third terms. I extended last week’s analysis of the presidential cycle from 1951 back to 1928 using daily data for the S&amp;P 500. The average gain for the third years of presidential terms was 13.4%, well ahead of the averages for the first (5.2%), second (4.5), and fourth years (5.5). Of the 21 third years, only two of them were down during the Great Depression. The 22 first years and 21 second years each included 10 downers. The 21 fourth years included six negative ones.  (3) Years ending in “5.” There have been eight years ending in “5” since the start of our daily S&amp;P 500 data. They all have been up with an average gain of 25.3% ranging from 3.0%-41.4%. By the way, the two-year gain for years ending in “5” and “6” averaged 37.6%, with seven of the eight periods having double-digit gains and only one period down by 5.2%.  Standard & Poors Today's Morning Briefing: Gridlock &amp; Goldilocks. (1) Three bullish cycles: Mid-term elections, third years of presidential terms, and years ending in “5.” (2) An anti-progressive, pro-business vote. (3) Review of Republican sweep. (4) Second “shellacking.” (5) Gridlock is bullish. Shutdowns are not. (6) Madison’s biggest fan. (7) McConnell’s impressive deal-making resume. (8) Employment report pushes the Fed to tighten sooner, but doves likely to focus on subdued wages. (9) Price inflation may be keeping lid on wage inflation. (10) “Stay Home” still the way to go. (11) “Interstellar” (-). (More for subscribers.)   FREE AppDownload

REUTERS/Hannibal HanschkePeople walk under stands with balloons placed along the former Berlin Wall location at East Side Gallery, which will be used in the installation 'Lichtgrenze' (Border of Light) in Berlin, November 7, 2014.The October jobs report was good. Payrolls are increasing, the unemployment rate is falling, and the labor force participation rate is inching higher. America is currently experiencing its longest streak of job gains since the 1930s. This comes as the stock market hits all-time highs. Tuesday's election result saw the Republicans take control of Congress. The good news for investors is that the stock market has a long track record of rallying after midterm elections. In fact, the last time the GOP took control of Congress with a Democrat in the White House, we experienced one of the best bull runs in history. Of course, that's just history. Here's your Monday Scouting Report: Top Stories Economic Calendar Market Commentary The S&amp;P 500 closed at an all-time high on Friday. Most of Wall Street's equity strategists are comfortable telling clients that stocks will continue to go much higher from here. However, fund manager John Hussman isn't so sanguine. "[R]ight now, we've got stocks valued at a point where we estimate the 10 year prospective return on the S&amp;P 500 will be about 1.6 to 1.7% annualized — talking right now with the S&amp;P 500 at 2032 as of today’s close," Hussman said in an interview with Peak Prosperity's Chris Martenson. Martenson noted that Hussman's assumptions would imply that the stock market is overvalued by 100%. "100%, yes," Hussman said. "I actually think the case is a little bit harsher than that; in fact, quite a bit harsher than that." For more insight about the middle market, visit mid-marketpulse.com. FREE AppDownload
AP Photo/Lionel CironneauSunday was the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, the most symbolic event marking the collapse of the Soviet Union. In the quarter of a century since the wall was knocked down, the political and economic systems in eastern Europe have been turned on their heads: Gone are the communist institutions, replaced with governments that are even more capitalistic than those on the western side of the Iron Curtain. Researchers at Capital Economics have published a fantastic series of charts on the transformation of post-Soviet eastern Europe. We've republished a selection of graphs from the report, which takes a look at 11 countries: Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, and Ukraine.

Thomson ReutersGeneral view of the French oil giant Total refinery in Mardyck near DunkerqueABU DHABI (Reuters) - Big oil companies such as Total  can withstand oil prices at $80 a barrel and the French firm will continue its current investment projects, Total's president for exploration and production said on Monday. "$100 was a good level to ensure continuous supply of projects for the future," Arnaud Breuillac told a news conference at a major energy industry conference in Abu Dhabi. But he added, "Large companies like Total have financial capability to weather a bit of time when the oil price is lower," and said Total did not want to cut back its investment budget. "We will continue with our capital discipline. We have a strong roadmap for the next few years with a lot of projects, and all of them will continue." Breuillac also said Total did not think oil prices would stay as low as $80 for long.  (Reporting by Maha El Dhana; Writing by Andrew Torchia) FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersBank of England Governor Mark Carney and Germany's Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann attend a conference of central bankers hosted by the Bank of France in ParisLONDON (Reuters) - The world's biggest banks should hold a buffer of bonds in case of a collapse so that government bailouts are avoided, a global regulatory body proposed on Monday. The draft rule is the last major piece of banking reform put forward by world leaders since the 2007-09 financial crisis forced taxpayers to shore up undercapitalised lenders. The Financial Stability Board (FSB), made up of regulators from the Group of 20 economies (G20), said global banks like Goldman Sachs &lt;gs.n&gt; and HSBC &lt;hsba.l&gt; should have a buffer of bonds or equity equivalent to 16 to 20 percent of their risk-weighted assets from January 2019. The bonds would be converted to equity to "bail in" a stricken bank. The total buffer would include the minimum mandatory core capital requirements banks must already hold. The proposal is set to be endorsed by G2O leaders later this week in Australia. It is being put out to public consultation until Feb. 2, 2015. FSB Chairman and Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said the buffer would be finalised next year, marking a watershed in ending banks that are too big to be allowed to fail. The new rule will apply to 30 banks the FSB has deemed to be globally systemically important, though initially those from emerging markets would be exempt. "Once implemented, these agreements will play important roles in enabling globally systemic banks to be resolved (wound down) without recourse to public subsidy and without disruption to the wider financial system," Carney said in a statement. Most of the banks would need to expand their issuance of debt to comply, the FSB said. Some senior debt already issued would will also need restructuring. To avoid banks downplaying the riskiness of their assets to meet the new rule, the buffer, formally known as total loss absorbing capacity or TLAC, must also be at least twice their leverage ratio, a separate measure of capital to total assets regardless of the level of risk. Globally, this yardstick has been set provisionally at 3 percent but it could be higher when finalised in 2015. Parts of the buffer would be held at major overseas subsidiaries to reassure regulators outside a bank's home country. "We believe TLAC will be a more material challenge in Europe than in the U.S.," Fitch ratings agency said ahead of the announcement. Extra requirements from national supervisors could swell the buffer to 25 percent of risk weighted assets, it added.   (Editing by Keiron Henderson) FREE AppDownload
 Russia and China just agreed to a second major gas deal, worth slightly less than the $400 billion agreement reached earlier this year, according to Bloomberg. The details of the deal mean Russia will supply China with another 30 billion cubic metres of gas every year for the next three decades through the Altai pipeline, a proposed pipe transporting the gas from western Siberia to China.  Earlier in the fall, Keun-Wook Paik at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies said this kind of deal would be "Putin’s revenge," according to the Financial Times. Many analysts see the move as evidence that Moscow is pivoting away from reliance on European customers and toward East Asia, where relatively rapid economic growth should prop up demand. It's also a political move, as relations with the rest of Europe have become increasingly cold after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and the tit-for-tat sanctions between the European Union, United States, and Russia.  The value of the Russian rouble has collapsed recently as the price of oil has declined. Russia's economy is dependent on oil, so the currency fluctuates with the oil price. The price declines in turn threaten Russia's ability to meet its budget obligations and pay debt. In sum, the country faces an economic crisis if it can't find new demand for oil and currency. But the rouble is rallying against the dollar today. Here's the US currency dropping by about 3% against the rouble after the central bank announced it would stop trying to defend the currency's collapse.  Bloomberg Curtailing the dollar's influence fits well with China's ambitions to increase the influence of the yuan and eventually turn it into a global reserve currency. With 32 percent of its $4 trillion foreign exchange reserves invested in US government debt, China wants to curb investment risks in dollar. The quest to limit the dollar's dominance became more urgent for Moscow this year when US and European governments imposed sanctions on Russia over its support for separatist rebels in Ukraine.    FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Stephen Lam Mark Zuckerberg (R), founder and CEO of Facebook, and wife Priscilla Chan arrive on the red carpet during the 2nd annual Breakthrough Prize Award in Mountain View, California November 9, 2014. SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Academia doesn't usually bring rich financial rewards. But that changed Sunday for recipients of a record 12 Breakthrough Prizes, the award created two years ago by Russian billionaire venture capitalist Yuri Milner, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, Google co-founder Sergey Brin and other tech industry luminaries. Each prize is worth $3 million, almost three times the cash a Nobel Prize winner receives. This year is the first to honor mathematicians. Five won for work ranging from algebraic geometry to analytic number theory. In future, just one prize a year will go to a mathematician, organizers say; the large number Sunday celebrates the inaugural year for math. Six prizes went to researchers in life sciences for discoveries in areas ranging from bacterial immunity to genetic regulation. The physics prize went to a group that showed the expansion of the universe was accelerating, not slowing as assumed. The prizes' funders aim to generate a sense of excitement around scientific accomplishment, Milner said in an interview. "We are trying to use all means available, including money, to get the message across," he said in an interview. Milner, a onetime physics PhD student in Moscow who dropped out to move to the United States in 1990, has backed some of the world’s biggest technology companies, including Facebook. Organizers threw some Hollywood razzle-dazzle into the mix. At the ceremony, Tesla chief executive Elon Musk chatted with actress Kate Beckinsale, while Twitter chief executive Dick Costolo sat by singer Christina Aguilera. Thomas Keller, chef of famed restaurant French Laundry, catered a meal including caviar appetizers and black-truffle lasagna. Seth MacFarlane, creator of the hit TV series “Family Guy,” hosted the ceremony. Presenters included Beckinsale, Cameron Diaz, along with actors Benedict Cumberbatch, Jon Hamm and Eddie Redmayne. Science could use the marketing, with portrayals of nerdy science types rife in movies and on television, a characterization MacFarlane nodded to in his remarks. "We're so glad that you all suck at sports," he told the roomful of scientists, adding that he hoped science would make advances such as putting a human being on Mars. "Maybe Ted Cruz," he suggested, referring to the Texas politician. In the interview, Milner contrasted today's low profile for scientists with 50 years ago, when scientist Albert Einstein was a household name. “If you look at the list of celebrities now, you could probably not find a single scientist in the list of the top 200,” he said. A self-proclaimed science fanatic, Milner keeps up with developments by reading stacks of science magazines. "It's my only hobby," he said.  (Editing by Douglas Royalty) FREE AppDownload
