 "American madness: a teenager is allowed to receive a rifle as a birthday gift," NYU professor Nouriel Roubini tweeted. "Sick sick country." Roubini's words came hours after a gunman killed one person and injured several others at Marysville-Pilchuck High School near Seattle, Washington. The gunman was later identified as Jaylen Fryberg, a freshman at the school. Fryberg, who shot and killed himself, reportedly had access to firearms, and an Instagram photo suggested that he had recently received a rifle as a birthday gift from his parents. Much of the media attention has shifted to the mental state of Fryberg, who reportedly had been demonstrating emotional distress. Roubini, however, argued that the focus should rather be about how easily accessible firearms are to people who may be mentally unstable. Sadly, this is not a new argument. Lax US gun control laws have been tied to numerous tragic school shootings in recent history. While highly publicized mass shootings are often expected to spur legislative change, little seems to actually get done. Here are Roubini's tweets: American madness: a teenager is allowed to receive a rifle as a birthday gift. Sick sick country.  Media idiocy: kid went on a rampage coz he was depressed. In a civilized country no one would have access to guns &amp; be able to kill if upset  Media psycho babble on why a kid goes shooting at school. No one ask why we live in a barbaric country where anyone can have access to guns  FREE AppDownload
Citi ResearchIt may sound obvious. But when you invest in stocks, you're at risk of getting wiped out. That really is the single most important risk to investors. Even when you think you're well-diversified, you could see the value of your investments quickly plunge or perhaps slowly bleed 90% of its value over years as the Greek stock market did during the eurozone crisis. Citi's Jonathan Stubbs addresses this in a recent research note about asset allocation. He included a chart highlighting some of the ugliest maximum drawdowns of in the global stock market. "Figure 45 shows various markets and industries which have suffered severe losses in relatively short order in recent decades, e.g., the UK (1972-74), the Nasdaq (2000-03), Greece (2008-12) and Mining (2008-09)," he writes. "Hence, buyer beware." Because many of these stocks are of companies that don't go bankrupt, the losses are just paper losses that you don't realize until you sell. If you have a long investment time horizon, you might think it wise to wait for the value to come back. Citi ResearchHowever, an investor must be willing to be extraordinarily patient if he hopes to recoup his losses. "It can sometimes take many years for investors to make their money back after suffering big losses," Stubbs writes. "For example, US equities only made it back to the peak 1929 total return levels in 1945, more than 15 years after the Great Crash. Kenji Abe, Citi’s Japanese strategist, highlights that Japanese equities are still a long way short of end-1989 peak levels." These are all things investors need to consider very carefully before they commit their life savings to the stock market. FREE AppDownload
We hear frequently from folks like Wharton professor Jeremy Siegel about the long history of the stock market outperforming other financial asset classes. Investment advisors often put it simply, saying that annual returns average around 10% and about 3% less than that on an inflation-adjusted, or real, basis. "Real US equity returns have annualized 6.8% since the 1870s, ahead of the 2.7% return from US government bonds," Citi Research's Jonathan Stubbs writes. In reality, we rarely see a year when returns are average. In a new report examining asset allocation, Stubbs presents this bar chart showing the average annual returns for stocks and Treasury bonds by decade. As you can see, most average annual returns swing far from average levels during these 10-year periods. This makes it very challenging to a be an investor strategizing for the long-term. "Equities have had three decades of negative real returns vs. five decades for bonds," Stubbs noted. "Real equity returns have beaten real bond returns in 12 out of the last 15 decades."

 Peter Boyce II, an associate with General Catalyst Partners, and co-founder of Rough Draft Ventures,  was recently interviewed by OneWire CEO Skiddy von Stade.  In the interview, he explained how he got into the startup business by founding Rough Draft, a company that seeds student startups.  When he was studying applied math and computer science at Harvard, he noticed his friends struggled to find funding for their great startups. They basically had two options. One was to enter a small business competition to win whatever was offered, even as little as $500. The other was to try and raise so much money that it made sense to drop out and run the business full-time. There was nothing in-between these two. That's why he co-founded Rough Draft, to scout for students running potentially game-changing startups from their dorm rooms, and expose them to the resources they need to grow. "There’s the $500 business plan competitions that you can enter into and win, then there’s the 'raise a million dollars and drop out of school,' but there’s really nothing in between and there’s really no network of students that were able to empower other students to pursue creating startups. That’s really what we created with Rough Draft Ventures. We have a team of students that basically helps identify and empower entrepreneurs at the university level, something that we’re insanely excited to do, something that we’re increasingly seeing - folks are going to continue to build amazing companies in their dorm room.   Boyce also runs the New York office of General Catalyst Partners and is expanding its footprint here. He's convinced that he's in the right city too. In the raging debate on the better coast for tech startups, he's Silicon Alley all the way. "We’ve staked our careers here in New York, voted with our feet in a way. But I think from a diversity perspective of just being able to interface with so many different industries, whether that's banking, marketing, fintech, I think there’s a lot of really great industries and a lot of great entrepreneurs that are going to build companies that [are] technology, that's going to empower and change these existing industries. And New York has been the epicenter for a lot of these industries for a long time ... I’m personally very biased towards this eco-system here in New York."

Wikimedia CommonsI featured the thinking of Dr. Lacy Hunt on the velocity of money and its relationship to developed-world overindebtedness and the potential for deflation in this week’s Thoughts from the Frontline, and I thought you’d like to peruse Lacy’s entire recent piece on the subject. Lacy takes the US, Europe, and Japan one by one, examining the velocity of money (V) in each economy and bolstering the principle, first proposed by Irving Fisher in 1933, that V is critically influenced by the productivity of debt. Then, turning to the equation of exchange (M*V=Nominal GDP, where M is money supply), he demonstrates that we shouldn’t be the least bit surprised by sluggish global growth and had better be on the lookout for global deflation. Hoisington Investment Management Company (www.Hoisingtonmgt.com) is a registered investment advisor specializing in fixed-income portfolios for large institutional clients. Located in Austin, Texas, the firm has over $5 billion under management and is the sub-adviser of the Wasatch-Hoisington US Treasury Fund (WHOSX). The U.S. economy continues to lose momentum despite the Federal Reserve’s use of conventional techniques and numerous experimental measures to spur growth. In the first half of the year, real GDP grew at only a 1.2% annual rate while real per capita GDP increased by a minimal 0.3% annual rate. Such increases are insufficient to raise the standard of living, which, as measured by real median household income, stands at the same level as it did seventeen years ago (Chart 1).  Over the latest five years ending June 30, 2014, real GDP expanded at a paltry 2.2% annual rate. In comparison, from 1791 through 1999, the growth in real GDP was 3.9% per annum. Similarly, real per capita GDP recorded a dismal 1.4% annual growth rate over the past five years, 26% less than the long-term growth rate. A large contributor to this remarkable downshift in economic growth was that in 1999 the combined public and private debt reached a critical range of 250%-275% of GDP. Econometric studies have shown that a country’s growth rate will lose about 25% of its “normal experience growth rate” when this occurs. Further, as debt relative to GDP moves above critical threshold levels, some researchers have found the negative consequences of debt on economic activity actually worsens at a greater rate, thus becoming non-linear. The post-1999 record is consistent with these findings as the U.S. debt-to-GDP levels swelled to a peak as high as 360%, well above the critical level noted in various economic studies. In terms of growth, it looks as if the second half of 2014 will continue to follow this slow growth pattern. Although all of the data has not yet been reported, it appears that the year-over-year growth in real GDP for the just ended third quarter period is unlikely to exceed the 2.2% pace of the past five years. Economic vigor is absent, and the final quarter of the year looks to be weaker than the third quarter. Poor domestic business conditions in the U.S. are echoed in Europe and Japan. The issue for Europe is whether the economy triple dips into recession or manages to merely stagnate. For Japan, the question is the degree of the erosion in economic activity. This is for an economy where nominal GDP has been unchanged for almost 22 years. U.S. growth is outpacing that of Europe and Japan primarily because those economies carry much higher debt-to-GDP ratios. Based on the latest available data, aggregate debt in the U.S. stands at 334%, compared with 460% in the 17 economies in the euro-currency zone and 655% in Japan. Economic research has suggested that the more advanced the debt level, the worse the economic performance, and this theory is in fact validated by the real world data. In this debt-constrained environment, it is not surprising that inflation is receding sharply in almost every major economy, including China. The drop in price pressures in the U.S. and Europe is significant, and the fall in Chinese inflation to 2%, from a peak of nearly 9% in 2008, is notable. In the latest twelve months, the CPI in the euro currency zone rose a scant 0.3% (Chart 2), the lowest since 2009, while the core CPI increased by 0.7%, near the all time lows for the series. The yearly gain in the U.S. for both core and overall CPI was 1.7%. Since 1958 when the core CPI came into existence, it and the overall CPI have increased at an average annual rate of 3.8% and 3.9%, respectively, over 200 basis points greater than the current rates. Both the overall and core personal consumption expenditures U.S. price indices rose by 1.5% in the twelve months ending August of 2014. Both of these are near the all time lows for their respective series.  The risk of outright deflation in Europe with inflation at such low levels, and the danger of similar developments in the U.S., should not be minimized as inflation has fallen in almost every previous U.S. and European economic contraction. Lower inflation is, in fact, almost as much of a hallmark of recessions as is decreasing real GDP. From peak-to-trough the rate of CPI inflation fell by an average of slightly more than 300 basis points in and around the mild U.S. recessions of 1990-91 and 2000-01. Starting from a much lower point, the CPI in Europe at those same times dropped by an average of 150 basis points. Given that inflation is already so minimal in both the U.S. and Europe, even the mildest recession could put both economies in deflation. Japan’s recent quantitative easing has helped devalue its currency by 44% versus the dollar, since the 2011 lows. This import- dependent country has therefore seen its costs rise dramatically. This, along with higher consumption taxes, has created a current year- over-year inflation rate of 3.3%. These higher prices are an enormous drag on economic growth as incomes fail to rise commensurately. Thus negative GDP growth will result in a continuing pattern of deflation. Japan’s CPI has been zero or negative on a year-over-year basis in 16 of the last 23 quarters. One factor that connects poor growth with the low inflation and low bond yields evident in the U.S., Europe and Japan is that the velocity of money (V) is falling in all three areas. Functionally, many things influence V. The factors that could theoretically influence V in at least some minimal fashion are too numerous to count. A key variable, however, appears to be the productivity of debt. Money and debt are created simultaneously. If the debt produces a sustaining income stream to repay principal and interest, then V will rise since GDP will rise by more than the initial borrowing. If the debt is unproductive or counterproductive, meaning that a sustaining income stream is absent, or worse the debt subtracts from future income, then V will fall. Debt utilized for the purpose of consumption or paying of interest, or debt that is defaulted on will be either unproductive or counterproductive, leading to a decline in V. The Nobel laureate Milton Friedman, as well as economist Irving Fisher, commented on the causal determinants of V. Friedman thought V was stable while Fisher believed it was variable. Presently, the evidence suggests that Fisher’s view has prevailed. Fisher would not be at all surprised by the current impact of excessive debt since he argued in his famous 1933 paper “The Debt-Deflation Theory of Great Depressions”, that falling money velocity is a symptom of extreme over-indebtedness. Tracking that theory, it is interesting to note that velocity is below historical norms in all three major economic areas with existing over indebtedness. The U.S. V is higher than European V, which in turn is higher than Japanese V. This pattern is entirely consistent since Japan is more highly indebted than Europe, which is more highly indebted than the U.S. Unfortunately, broad monetary conditions (M2 money growth and velocity) are deteriorating, with 2014 displaying conditions worse than at the end of last year. The poor trend in the velocity for all three areas indicates that monetary policy for these countries is not a factor in influencing economic activity in any meaningful way. United States. The U.S. year-over-year M2 growth has remained at about 6%, an annual growth level that has been consistent since 2008 (Chart 3), and the velocity of money has trended downward by about 3%. In the first half of 2014, V declined at a rate of 3.6%, but it is still too early to tell if this represents a new V deceleration to the downside (Chart 4).   According to the equation of exchange (M*V=Nominal GDP), the expected growth of nominal GDP is constrained to no more than a 3% increase with velocity declining by 3% and money supply expanding by 6%. However, when assessing the type of debt currently being employed (unproductive, at best) the risks are for lower growth levels. 2014 has witnessed a resurgence of consumer auto and mortgage lending that was achieved by a lowering of credit standards. The percentage of subprime consumer auto loans (31%) returned to the peak levels reached prior to 2008. Such lending has historically turned counterproductive. If this were to occur again, velocity would accelerate to the downside, resulting in a sub 3% path for nominal GDP. Europe. V has only been available in Europe since 1995 as that is the starting date for GDP in the euro-currency zone. During the span from 1995 through 2013, V averaged 1.4, dropping from a peak of about 1.7 in 1995 to 1.03 in 2013 (Chart 5). Over that span, therefore, euro V has been trending lower at about a 2.6% per annum rate. On the money side, euro M2 increased by 2.4% in 2013, which is weaker than the average growth in the last four years (Chart 6). If the trend rate of decline in V remains intact, then nominal GDP in the euro zone could be flat. Inflation of any magnitude would result in a negative real GDP outcome.   Japan. From the start of the comparable M2 and nominal GDP statistics in 1969 in Japan, V in Japan has averaged 1.0, dropping from 1.54 in 1968 to a record low of 0.57 in the latest year (Chart 7). Thus, over this period V was falling at an average rate of 2.2% per annum. M2 in Japan increased 3.6% in 2013, which is slightly higher than the growth rate of recent years (Chart 8). If V’s downward trend remains intact, nominal GDP would be estimated to grow by 1.2%. However, inflation is currently running at 3.3%, suggesting real GDP could decline by over 2% in the next twelve months. This circumstance illustrates the double-edged sword caused by a sharply depreciating currency. The weaker yen boosts exports but raises domestic inflation. Japanese inflation is already exceeding the rise in wages and household spending. These events are consistent with a contraction in economic activity and are the expectation derived from the analysis of money growth and its velocity.   Important new research by four distinguished economists (three in Europe and one in the U.S.) is contained in a report titled "Deleveraging? What Deleveraging?" (Luigi Buttiglione, Philip R. Lane, Lucrezia Reichlin and Vincent Reinhart, Geneva Reports on the World Economy 16, September 2014). It provides additional evidence on the role of “debt dynamics” and the state of the global debt overhang. They write, “Contrary to widely held beliefs, the world has not yet begun to delever and the global debt-to-GDP is still growing, breaking new highs.” Further, it is a "poisonous combination" when world growth and inflation are lower than expected and debt is rising. “Deleveraging and slower nominal growth are in many cases interacting in a vicious loop, with the latter making the deleveraging process harder and the former exacerbating the economic slowdown.” This research also identifies two other highly significant trends. First, global debt accumulation was led by developed economies until 2008. Second, the debt build-up since 2008 has been paced by the emerging economies. The authors write that the rise in Chinese debt is especially “stunning”. They describe China as “between a rock (rising and high debt) and a hard place (lower growth).” In addition to China they identify India, Turkey, Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Indonesia, Russia and South Africa as belonging to the “fragile eight” group of countries that could find themselves in the unwanted role of host to “the next leg of the global leverage crisis.” We interpret this research to mean that the monetary policy may begin to become ineffective at emerging market central banks, just as has happened in the U.S., Europe and Japan. Weaker growth conditions in the emerging markets are thus likely to accentuate, rather than ameliorate, poor business conditions in the major economies. Indeed, this year’s downturn in global commodity prices is consistent with the beginning of such a phase. The huge jump in emerging market debt is also significant because research has found the severity of economic contractions is directly related to the leverage in the prior expansion. Historically, in our judgment, the most important authority on the subject of asset bubbles was the late MIT professor Charles Kindleberger, author of 20 books including the one of the greatest books on capital markets Manias, Panics and Crashes (1978). He found that asset price bubbles depend on the growth of credit. Atif Mian (Princeton) and Amir Sufi (University of Chicago) provided confirmation for Kindleberger’s pioneering work and expanded on it in their 2014 book House of Debt. Chapter 8, entitled “Debt and Bubbles,” contains the heart of their insights. Mian and Sufi demonstrate that increasing the flow of credit is extremely counterproductive when the fundamental problem is too much debt, and excessive debt can fuel asset bubbles. Based on our reading of these two books we would define an asset bubble as a rise in prices that is caused by excess central bank liquidity rather than economic fundamentals. As Kindleberger clearly stated, the process of excess liquidity fueling higher prices in the face of faltering fundamentals can run for a long time, a phase Kindleberger called “overtrading”. But eventually, this gives way to “discredit”, when the discerning few see the discrepancy between prices and fundamentals. Eventually, discredit yields to “revulsion”, when the crowd understands the imbalance, and markets correct. Economists have commented on the high correlation between the S&amp;P 500 and the Fed’s balance sheet since 2009. From 2009 to the latest available month, the monetary base (MB) surged from $1.7 trillion to $4.1 trillion. We ran the MB increase against the S&amp;P 500 and found a very high correlation of 0.69. While correlation does not prove causality, the high correlation is certainly not inconsistent with the idea that the Fed liquidity played a major role in boosting stock prices. However, even as the MB has exploded since 2009 and stock prices have soared, the U.S. economy has experienced the worst economic expansion on record. In spite of a further large rise in the base this year, the GDP growth has subsided noticeably and corporate profits after taxes and adjusted for inventory gains/losses (IVA) and over/under depreciation (CCA) has declined 10% in the latest four quarters. Such discrepancy between the liquidity implied by the base and measures of economic performance could indicate the process of bubble formation. Kindleberger’s axiom that asset price bubbles depend on excess liquidity may yet face another test. With the nominal growth trajectory extremely soft, U.S. Treasury bond yields are likely to continue working lower as similar circumstances have created declines in government bond yields in Europe and Japan. Viewing the yields overseas, it is evident that ample downside still exists for long U.S. Treasury bond yields, as the higher U.S. yields offer global investors an incentive to continue to move funds into the United States. Another factor suggesting lower long- term U.S. Treasury yields is the strength of the U.S. dollar. In many industries, the price leader for certain goods in the U.S. is a foreign producer. A rising dollar leads to what economists sometimes call the “collapsing umbrella”. As the dollar lifts, the foreign producer cuts U.S. selling prices, forcing domestic producers to match the lower prices. This reinforces the prospect for lower inflation as nominal GDP wanes. This creates a favorable environment for falling U.S. Treasury bond yields. Van R. Hoisington Lacy H.

Columbia Management Next month’s midterm election battle for control of the U.S. Senate is going to be a dramatically close call. Republicans can gain control of the Senate if they win six new seats. Incumbent Democrats are defending 21 seats, and seven of those are in broadly red states won by Mitt Romney in 2012. Conventional wisdom would suggest that President Obama’s low current approval ratings would provide a significant tailwind for the GOP, but the reality is a little more complex. First and foremost, the broad approval ratings of the legislative branch (both parties) are even lower than those for the president as the electorate is generally disappointed in Washington’s performance. Secondly, the state-by-state situations are complicated and unique. We have some disruptive third party candidates in several elections; we have seen some candidates’ prospects diverging from their local party strength/weakness based on their own campaigning skill or lack thereof. Third, several national issues that were GOP rallying points in prior months have lost some of their punch. In particular, public concern about the ACA (Obamacare) has fallen significantly. Similarly, the GOP effort to run on support for U.S. energy independence and energy-based job creation seems less effective with dramatically falling oil/gasoline prices. Finally, despite the oft-cited portrayal of the GOP as the party of Big Money, the Democrats have a significant overall funding advantage in these elections; that money will give them an edge in the advertising barrage that we will see down the home stretch. Currently, odds-maker and strategist consensus suggests a slightly better than average chance that the GOP seizes control of the Senate. We see things similarly. But if we dig a little deeper, what might the potential different outcomes mean more specifically for specific industries? Some notable examples of areas that would likely be affected are: Energy: A GOP win would significantly change the tone around energy policy discussion. A GOP win would likely result in Mitch McConnell (R-KY), a staunch defender of coal, becoming Senate Majority Leader, Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), a vocal supporter of legalizing oil exports, heading the Senate Energy Committee and Jim Inofe (R-OK), famous for calling global warming “the second biggest hoax ever” stepping in as chair of the Senate Committee of the Environment and Public Works. Prospects for LNG and crude oil exports, accelerated drilling licenses offshore and on federal land, and reduced regulation or threats to MLP’s would clearly improve. Conversely, subsidies for alternative energy would come under greater scrutiny. Healthcare: While much of the rhetoric around a GOP resurgence six months ago swirled around pledges to reverse the ACA, any serious effort along those lines seems highly unlikely at this point. Even issues such as rescinding the medical device tax would be tough to reconcile with a broader push to balance budgets given the need for a very hefty offsetting budget item. Some efforts to slow or reverse portions of ACA reimbursements are more likely, potentially causing stress on some struggling hospitals. The backdrop of scrutiny on specific pharmaceutical and biotech pricing would likely improve with a GOP win. Defense: While the initial assumption might logically be that a GOP win would create a more friendly environment for defense spending, we would offer a note of caution. That’s because a GOP win would likely result in John McCain becoming the chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Sen. McCain is a passionate supporter of the military, but has often been a vocal critic of expensive new weapons systems. There are many other niches that may be significantly affected. Lower regulation (good for many financials and for-profit education) and lower discretionary government spending (bad for domestic infrastructure build) would likely follow a GOP win. Regardless of the midterm outcome, the bigger game for both parties is positioning for the 2016 elections. One of the major issues for both parties to address between now and then is their stance on tax reform. Many observers believe that no room for compromise around tax and entitlement reform is likely before the presidential election. However, I do believe that the groundwork for discussion will begin to form and increasingly be a market focus. We noted a few weeks ago that “[w]hile there is clearly a wide political divide on key elements of comprehensive tax reform, there does seem to be some common ground. Republicans want to lower tax rates, but may be open to closing loopholes. Democrats want to raise tax revenues while eliminating perceived inequities. This would seem to leave the closing of loopholes as common ground for compromise. Therefore, while comprehensive tax reform is unlikely to pass ahead of the 2016 elections, we suggest caution around companies that have taken particularly aggressive tax stances. Debate around these issues is likely to draw market attention to the risks to earnings in advance of legislation actually being passed.” Let us end on an optimistic and bipartisan note. While there is no definitive reason why, the 12-month periods following midterms since 1950 have been very friendly for equity investors. The market has been up in all sixteen of these periods, with a 16.1% average return by the S&amp;P 500 Index (chart). Perhaps expectations drop on fears of change and disruption, and the reality surprises on the upside. We hope that this year’s hard-fought election bodes well for markets yet again regardless of who prevails.

Unpredictable dangers abound, particularly from the Ebola epidemic, which has killed thousands in West Africa and jangled nerves far beyond. But the biggest economic threat, by far, comes from continental Europe. Now thatGerman growth has stumbled, the euro area is on the verge of tipping into its third recession in six years. Its leaders have squandered two years of respite, granted by the pledge of Mario Draghi, the European Central Bank’s president, to do “whatever it takes” to save the single currency. The French and the Italians have dodged structural reforms, while the Germans have insisted on too much austerity.  Prices are falling in eight European countries. The zone’s overall inflation rate has slipped to 0.3% and may well go into outright decline next year. A region that makes up almost a fifth of world output is marching towards stagnation and deflation. Although many Europeans, especially the Germans, have been brought up to fear inflation, deflation can be still more savage (see article). If people and firms expect prices to fall, they stop spending, and as demand sinks, loan defaults rise. That was what happened in the Great Depression, with especially dire consequences in Germany in the early 1930s. REUTERS/Yannis Behrakis Continental Europe’s economy has plenty of big underlying weaknesses, from poor demography to heavy debt and sclerotic labour markets.So it is worrying that, of the 46 countries whose central banks target inflation, 30 are below their target. Some price falls are welcome. Tumbling oil prices, in particular, have given consumers’ incomes a boost (see article). But slowing prices and stagnant wages owe more to weak demand in the economy and roughly 45m workers are jobless in the rich OECD countries. Investors are starting to expect lower inflation even in economies, such as America’s, that are growing at reasonable rates. Worse, short-term interest rates are close to zero in many economies, so central banks cannot cut them to boost spending. The only ammunition comes from quantitative easing and other forms of printing money. The global lowflation threat is a good reason for most central banks to keep monetary policy loose. It is also, in the longer term, a prompt to look at revising inflation targets a shade upwards. But the immediate problem is the euro area. Continental Europe’s economy has plenty of big underlying weaknesses, from poor demography to heavy debt and sclerotic labour markets. But it has also made enormous policy mistakes. France, Italy and Germany have all eschewed growth-enhancing structural reforms. The euro zone is particularly vulnerable to deflation because of Germany’s insistence on too much fiscal austerity and the ECB’s timidity. Even now, with economies contracting, Germany is still obsessed with deficit reduction for all governments, while its opposition to monetary easing has meant that the ECB, to the obvious despair of Mr Draghi, has done far less than other big central banks in terms of quantitative easing (notwithstanding this week’s move to start buying “covered bonds”). AP ImagesGermany, which can borrow money at negative real interest rates, could spend more building infrastructure at home.If there was ever logic to this incrementalism, it has run out. As budgets shrink and the ECB struggles to convince people that it can stop prices slipping, a descent into deflation seems all too probable. Signs of stress are beginning to appear in both the markets and politics. Bond yields in Greece have risen sharply, as support for the left-wing Syriza party has surged (see article). France and Germany are trading rhetorical blows over a new budget proposal coming out of Paris. If Europe is to stop its economy getting worse, it will have to stop its self-destructive behaviour. The ECB needs to start buying sovereign bonds. Germany’s chancellor, Angela Merkel, should allow France and Italy to slow the pace of their fiscal cuts; in return, those countries should accelerate structural reforms. Germany, which can borrow money at negative real interest rates, could spend more building infrastructure at home. Amanda Macias/Business InsiderThe ECB needs to start buying sovereign bonds.That would help, but not be enough. It is a bit like the early years of the euro debacle, before Mr Draghi’s whatever-it-takes pledge, when half-solutions only fed the crisis. Something radical is needed. The hitch is that European law bans many textbook solutions, such as ECB purchases of newly issued government bonds. The best legal option is to couple a dramatic increase in infrastructure spending with bond-buying by the ECB. Thus the European Investment Bank could launch a big (say €300 billion, or $383 billion) expansion in investments such as faster cross-border rail links or more integrated electricity grids—and raise the money by issuing bonds, which the ECB could buy in the secondary market. Another possibility would be to redefine the EU’s deficit rules to exclude investment spending, which would allow governments to run bigger deficits, again with the ECB providing a backstop. Behind all this sits a problem of political will (see article). Mrs Merkel and the Germans seem prepared to take action only when the single currency is on the verge of catastrophe. Throughout Europe people are hurting—in Italy and Spain youth unemployment is above 40%. Voters vented their fury with the established order in the EU’s parliamentary elections earlier this summer, and got very little change. Another descent into the abyss will test their patience. And once deflation has an economy in its jaws, it is very hard to shake off. Europe’s leaders are running out of time. FREE AppDownload
FlickrFA Insights is a daily newsletter from Business Insider that delivers the top news and commentary for financial advisers.  Don't Freak Out, The Recent Volatility Is Normal (Charles Schwab) Everyone's been talking about the recent spike in market volatility. However, it's nothing to worry about, and it isn't unique. "Corrections are normal in bull markets and we have gone without one for an extended period," write Liz Ann Sonders, Brad Sorensen, and Jeffrey Kleintop. The volatility might continue in the short-run, but Charles Schwab analysts believe that equity-investors should focus on the long-term picture instead. Right now, they believe that the long-term picture is positive because the US economy is improving and monetary policy remains "quite loose." Additionally, Charles Schwab analysts recommend diversifying portfolios with emerging markets. Wealthy Executives Need Help With Their Own Finances (Financial Planning) "Just because your clients are successful executives doesn't mean they understand their own finances," writes Andrew Pavia.  There are three major things to keep in mind. First, advisers should create liquidity for executive clients with the sale of restricted stock. Second, advisers should hedge and diversify their portfolios, and employ strategies "allow clients to minimize downside risk and defer tax consequences," says John Neresian. Lastly, advisers should have a conversation about charitable giving with their clients as well. Many clients are wealthier today than several years ago and may have unrealized capital gains they want to bequeath in a tax-efficient way. Advisors Were A Force Behind The Recent Market Sell-Off (Investment News)  Advisors "played a role" in the recent market sell-off because many turned to risk-averse ETFs, says Nicholas Colas. Data from October shows that there was "an almost perfect swap" from stocks to bonds.  Registered investment advisers have been increasingly using ETFs for low-cost allocation strategies on behalf of their clients, reports Colas. And as the stock market got more volatile, this ETF user group would have moved away from stocks towards bond ETFs. Because of this, the equity market might remain volatile for the year. If there are any signs of economic slowing, "we will see the same trade as last week all over again: out of stocks, into bonds," writes Colas. Investors Should Keep Both Low-Volatility And Higher Quality Stocks In Portfolios (Alliance Bernstein) "The best time to prepare for volatility is when it's not there," writes Kent Hargis. As a result, it behooves investors to keep stocks with less volatile characteristics even before volatility hits the market. That way, when it does, investors will be prepared. Additionally, stocks with higher quality characteristics should also be in portfolios. "Our analysis has shown that over a full market cycle, a strategy that combines both less volatile and quality stocks generated even stronger risk-adjusted returns than either approach alone. The reason is because they tend to work best at different times," writes Hargis. Focusing On Passive Versus Active Is The Wrong Way To Think About It (Vanguard)  Focusing on active versus passive management is the wrong way to think about portfolios, argues Fran Kinniry. "I really wouldn't get hung up on active index as much as I would what are the details of the investment you're considering," he says. Investors should focus on whether or not something is low cost, he argues.  If investors are looking for active management, they should do it not because it's "not passive" but because there is a talented team working, with an agreeable philosophy. And again, investors should look for the lowest costs. FREE AppDownload
 McDonald's US business is continuing to slide.  The fast food chain is struggling with declining sales, fast-casual competitors, and unrest from workers and franchisees. This week, the company announced US sales fell 3.3% last quarter.  McDonald's CEO Don Thompson said the brand has a strong turnaround plan in place.  "I am confident in our ability to regain momentum in the US given the actions that we’re taking and the pace at which we’re moving," Thompson told investors earlier this week.  He outlined the brand's strategy for saving its US business.  McDonald's is working to tailor menu items and promotions for different regional markets.  Thompson says that in many cases, franchisees will have the power to decide which items and promotions they offer in restaurants.  Offering a more tailored menu could help bring in new customers who appreciate that McDonald's is catering to their tastes. It could also help ease tensions from franchisees who say that the company's constant new menu items are creating financial and operational challenges.  McDonald's is planning on getting rid of some menu items in January.  The current menu, which has grown 70% since 2007, has been cited as the reason for long wait times and declining customer service.  Paring down the menu will "better highlight customers’ favorites and to make the experience faster and easier for our customers and our crew," Thompson said.  Having fewer menu items could also lead to a better work environment and higher employee retention.  Consumers have been eager to personalize their food, as evidenced by the popularity of fast-casual chains like Five Guys and Chipotle.  McDonald's has been testing a concept that lets customers use tablets to build their own burgers with toppings like guacamole, bacon, or jalapenos.  The brand is also offering consumers the option to upgrade their breakfast sandwiches with egg whites or white cheddar.  AP Photo/Yves Logghe McDonald's is fighting back against accusations that its food is unhealthy and overly processed.  The company recently released a video starring former "MythBusters" cohost Grant Imahara. He tours a meat factory in California that produces beef patties.  "Conveying the facts and adjusting misperceptions about the freshness, quality and integrity of our ingredients appeals to our customers and supports the work we’re doing to offer greater menu choice," Thompson said.   FREE AppDownload
Money can't buy happiness. "This sentiment is lovely, popular, and almost certainly wrong," says Harvard psychologist Daniel Gilbert in a paper he coauthored.  Money provides an "opportunity for happiness" the authors say, since moneyed people can live longer and healthier lives, enjoy financial security, have leisure time, and control what they do every day.  What's puzzling, Gilbert and his colleagues Elizabeth Dunn of the University of British Columbia and Timothy Wilson of the University of Virginia say, is that money doesn't buy more happiness.  Psych research suggests that after certain thresholds — some say $50,000 a year, others say $75,000 — the correlation between income and well-being slopes off. "[Money] is an opportunity that people routinely squander because the things they think will make them happy often don't," the authors say.  Thus the title of their paper: "If money doesn't make you happy then you probably aren't spending it right." With that tension in mind, Gilbert, author of "Stumbling on Happiness," and his colleagues suggest the following principles to guide your spending.  Here they are: In a survey of over 1,000 Americans, 57% of respondents said that they derived greater happiness from an experiential purchase, like a trip, concert, or other life event, over a material purchase, like a car, appliance, or other object. We like experiences more because we get to anticipate and remember them, the research says, and we appreciate them longer. "After devoting days to selecting the perfect hardwood floor to install in a new condo, homebuyers find their once beloved Brazilian cherry floors quickly become nothing more than the unnoticed ground beneath their feet," the authors say. "In contrast, their memory of seeing a baby cheetah at dawn on an African safari continues to provide delight." Human beings are the most social animals on Earth, meaning that our happiness is enriched from our social connections. Nourishing those connections is a fruitful way to spend your dough — brain scans show that spending money on other people activates the reward centers of your brain. "Pro-social spending has a surprisingly powerful impact on social relationships," the authors say. One of the key findings of happiness research is the power of adaptation: We get used to the things that we have around us all the time. We grow accustomed to the friends we share tea with, the romantic partners we share our beds with, and the totally sweet songs we blast in our ears. After a while, big purchases become normal things. As miraculous as its feels, that expensive new iPhone will inevitably reveal itself to be just a smartphone in a matter of weeks.  For this reason, giving yourself inexpensive indulgences is a clever way to gather up lots of bursts of happiness.  "As long as money is limited by its failure to grow on trees," the authors argue, "we may be better off devoting our finite financial resources to purchasing frequent doses of lovely things rather than infrequent doses of lovelier things." A fine argument for the latte, is it not?  The bad news is that we adapt to good things. The good news is that we adapt to bad things. So buy less insurance. "People seek extended warranties and generous return policies in order to preclude the possibility of future regret," the authors say, "but research suggests that the warranties may be unnecessary for happiness and the return policies may actually undermine it." Tons of psych literature shows that delaying gratification leads to a satisfied, successful, happy life. But our economic system — replete with credit cards and promises of "no money down!" — creates incentives to consume now, pay later. This "leads to shortsighted behavior — to rack up debts, to save little for retirement," the authors say, but "in the end, the piper must be paid, and when that happens, lives are often ruined." So buy now and enjoy later, since you'll also get the benefits of anticipation. When we're imagining how awesome it would be to own something, we tend to forget the details. And happiness, the authors say, is in the details. So before you make a big purchase, consider all the headaches that might come with owning that new thing: the mosquitoes that will pester your quaint cabin in the woods, the extra tailoring you'll need to do on that new suit. It happens to famous people, too. George Clooney bought a Tesla Roadster as a toy — and had to sell the thing because he was "always stuck on the side of the f------ road" with it. We have a weird way of fooling ourselves by comparison shopping. "By altering the psychological context in which decisions are made," the authors say, "comparison shopping may distract consumers from attributes of a product that will be important for their happiness, focusing their attention instead on attributes that distinguish the viable options." They provide a real estate example. If you're going around to tons of open houses, you might get caught up in buying a spacious house that's nicer than the other ones you looked at and taking out a crippling loan to do so — rather than spending less on a more modest home. "Research suggests that the best way to predict how much we will enjoy an experience is to see how much someone else enjoyed it," the authors say. For example, studies suggest that your friends have a better idea of who you'd enjoy dating than you do. "Other people can supply us with a valuable source of data not only by telling us what has made them happy," the authors say, "but also by providing information about what they think will make us happy." So if you're going to spend, consult your friends. And imagine all the things that could go wrong — and right. FREE AppDownload
SodaStream Shares of Sodastream finished up more than 15%. Following the news, which was first reported by Bloomberg, Pepsi shares gained 0.9%. In its report, Beverage Digest, citing a source, said the Sodastream test using Pepsi products would involve "major SodaStream customers Wal-Mart and Bed Bath &amp; Beyond" in some Florida markets. The test, which will be a 10-week test selling some Pepsi-branded products, will involve "naturally sweetened" brands not sold at retail: "Pepsi Homemade" and "Sierra Mist Homemade," Beverage Digest said.  Beverage Digest reports that the actual flavors will be: Pepsi Homemade, Pepsi Homemade Vanilla, Pepsi Homemade Wild Cherry, Sierra Mist Homemade, Sierra Mist Homemade Peach, and Sierra Mist Homemade Cranberry. Beverage Digest's report also said that Pepsi was looking at "various in-home dispenser opportunities and has partnered with another manufacturer of in-home dispensers, Bevyz, in Europe."  Bevyz is set to launch machines in the US under a partnership with Cuisinart. In an emailed statement to Business Insider, a Pepsi spokesman said: At-home, make-your-own beverages represent an emerging category that has generated interest among some consumers. As we’ve said previously, PepsiCo is exploring multiple technologies in this space. SodaStream is one of several companies we’re talking to about potential ideas for the future. Our discussions with SodaStream are specifically focused on a small-scale, limited-time test scheduled for later this year. We don’t have any additional information to share at this time. And in a regulatory filing, Sodastream said:  Further to press reports that were published today, SodaStream International Ltd. (the “Company”) confirms that as the leader of the at-home, make-your-own beverages, category it has entered into an agreement with PepsiCo, Inc. (“PepsiCo”) specifically focused on a small-scale, limited time test to make certain of PepsiCo’s brands available for use on the Company’s system. The limited test is scheduled for later this year. Consistent with the Company's practice to date, the Company is also exploring multiple relationships with other leading beverage brands.Exceptionally, the Company would like to stress that this is a limited test and that there are currently no discussions between the Company and PepsiCo concerning any other form of broader business collaboration. Following this report and consistent with past practice, the Company undertakes no obligation to provide any updates and will not comment on rumors or speculation. Sodastream and Pepsi have long been the subject of market and industry rumors, including speculation that Pepsi might one day want to buy Sodastream, but to date nothing has come of that speculation. Here's the chart showing Sodastream's big day on Friday.  Google Finance  FREE AppDownload
Bloomberg TVTom Lee.Fundstrat Global Advisors' Tom Lee has screened the market for stocks that he believes are going nowhere or going down. He found nine. "The nine avoid ideas are based on the seven industries with the greatest positive dislocation and hence more likely to correct," Lee wrote in a note to clients. All of the names on the list are in the electric utilities industry. They have a price-to-earnings ratio (2015 estimate) of greater than 15x and free cash flow yield of less than 2%. Lee believes the S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average could double in five years. But these nine names are expected to be a drag. FREE AppDownload
Arnd Wiegmann/ReutersStocks rallied on Friday to cap their best week of 2014, as the S&amp;P 500 gained 4%, the Nasdaq gained 5%, and the Dow gained more than 2% after last week's extremely volatile trading action. This week was also a busy week for tech earnings, with Apple, Amazon, Yahoo, and Microsoft all reporting their quarterly earnings, in addition to a number of Dow members including Caterpillar and 3M. First, the scoreboard: And now, the top stories on Friday: 1. Stocks rallied to finish the best week of 2014 for the markets, as the S&amp;P 500 gained 5% and the Dow and Nasdaq also gained more than 2%. Stocks were bolstered by corporate earnings reports that the market, and as Rich Barry, floor governor at the NYSE wrote in an email this afternoon, "The market remains, 'Strong like bull'... stocks are extending their rally because of solid earnings and because the U.S. is the absolute best economy in the world. Oh, and keep this point in mind: We are now entering a seasonally strong period of the year for stocks, and with most hedge funds underperforming the market this year, they are being forced to participate in the market as we get closer to year-end." 2. The big loser on Friday was Amazon, which fell more than 8% after the online retailer reported a wider than expected quarterly loss on Thursday afternoon. And as Business Insider's Jillian D'Onfro reported, the tone around Amazon has shifted significantly as analysts seem to be getting impatient with the company's continued underperformance on the bottom line.  3. New home sales in September came in at an annualized selling rate of 467,000, which was up 0.2% from August's revised number. August's number, however was revised down sharply, to an annualized rate of 466,000 from 504,000, an initial number that blew away expectations. The report also showed that at the current rate of sales, the US housing supply stands at 5.3 months.  4. Sodastream shares were a big gainer on Friday, rising more than 15% after a report in trade publication Beverage Digest, citing a source, said that Pepsi would test flavored pods for Sodastream's at-home soda brewing machine. In an emailed statement to Business Insider, Pepsi confirmed that it was participating in a trial with Sodastream, but added the the company is "one of several companies we're talking to about potential ideas for the future." Pepsi has long been rumored as a potential suitor to buy Pepsi outright, but nothing has ever come of that speculation.  5. Ford reported earnings on Friday morning that beat expectations, but shares of the carmaker fell more than 4% as profits fell sharply from a year ago.  6. European banks are set to get results from the European Central Bank's required stress test on Sunday, and a report from Bloomberg on Friday said that 25 banks are in-line to fail the test. Bloomberg also said about 10 of these banks will have to plug capital shortfalls, though which banks might be faced with this task were unknown.  7. The Russian ruble keeps falling against the dollar, with the falling price of oil and concerns that the country faces an imminent debt downgrade from ratings agencies continue to pressure the currency.  Don't Miss: People Are Way Too Freaked Out About Deflation » FREE AppDownload
The financial crisis did curious things to Wall Street. Firms were gone overnight, once-powerful CEOs were never heard from again, and a whole new regime of power reorganized itself from the chaos. This is the kind of environment in which typically buttoned up trade publications write headlines like the following: "How Merrill Lynch's divorce of its own $2.5-billion team shows just how fed up the wirehouse is with RIA-bound breakaways." The "wirehouses" are big Wall Street firms. An "RIA" is a Registered Investment Advisor. And that headline is about a Wall Street firm kicking a $2.5 billion team out the door — allegedly for not telling their clients to buy into a hedge fund the firm was pushing. Now the team in question can strike out on its own, something a lot of teams are doing these days for better or worse. Wealth management — once considered the boring part of Wall Street's business — has become incredibly profitable. Big banks that doubled down on it after the crisis, like Morgan Stanley, are reaping the rewards. But they're also losing bodies to these "breakaways" — the independent channel — which will have increased by an estimated 15,000 people from 2007 to 2017 while big banks, regional banks and others will have seen their headcounts shrink by the thousands. So as you see, what we have here is a good old-fashioned debate about the best way to run money. "While the [independent] adviser may initially be attracted by a higher payout," said Gary Kaminsky, the Vice-Chairman of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management,  "It's never been clear how that benefits the client." What Kaminsky and Morgan Stanley are clear on is what they can provide — an "open architecture" format where their experienced portfolio managers can advise their clients on whatever products they want, the ability to design products, and access to an investment bank. It's a mix that's been working for Morgan Stanley. Since the financial crisis the bank now has $2 trillion assets under management in its wealth management division. In the third quarter net revenues were up to $3.8 billion from $3.5 billion at the same time the year before. "If we assume that institutional securities businesses should trade at roughly 10x earnings, that implies MS's wealth and asset management business trades at a several turn discount to peers," said a recent report by UBS. "Separately, we believe MS has a far stronger WM franchise and brand than the regional brokers and actually should command a premium." This has made Morgan Stanley the envy of the Street — and even Goldman Sachs, more identified with its trading culture, is getting into the game. "At the end of the day advisers who have tried the independent route find they spend the bulk of their time on operations, HR etc.," Kaminsky added. "When they leave the full service world they are disappointed." It's true, the challenges of running a business while also running a portfolio can be daunting, but advisers that have left say that the independence to manage their businesses the way they like, the freedom to invest the way they like, and of course — the economics are better for them. "The opportunity to maintain more of the revenue and balance your own profits &amp; losses. Your net payout is not determined by corporate structure, rather how well you manage your growth and expenses With payouts ranging anywhere from 85% to 100% depending on your business structure, the independent model has far greater potential upside," said Guy Adami, Chief Market Strategist at Private Adviser Group. Private Advisor Group represents a sort of middle ground. It's a network of advisors that pool resources and support to create a community. This is an idea that's catching on quickly. Instead of striking out on your own entirely as an independent, you join up with a firm that helps you with the back and middle ends of your office — with your marketing, with your business model, with financing and getting a good price on investment products. Dynasty Financial Partners, an emerging powerhouse in this space, handles everything from vendor relationships and oversees expenses for members of its networks. It will find a member's office, set up their website, and take care of issues regarding succession. "We are entrepreneurs ourselves, serving entrepreneurs," said Dynasty CEO Shirl Penney, adding that his members get the bonus of being a part of a community of business people working toward a common goal. As for the clients his members serve, Penney said that they benefit from separating where products are made (inside investment banks) and where they are sold. That's something he believes clients are beginning to understand more and more. "Assets in our industry are only going one way," said Penney. "And the life blood of our industry is assets."

The release of new Social Security Administration wage data gives us a chance to update our analysis of wage trends for the top 1.0% of wage earners and wage groups in the bottom 99.0%. There’s some surprising news this year, as top 1.0% wages fell, while the remainder of the workforce saw real wage improvements. In the analysis below we review these recent trends, as well as trends during the Great Recession and over the longer-term. New data for 2013 (Table 1) provide some surprising news: real average annual wages nudged down slightly, falling 0.2% since 2012, because wages of the top 1.0% of wage earners declined, although those of the bottom 99.0% grew. The biggest wage decline was among the top 0.1% of earners, whose wages fell 9.0%, while the next 0.9% saw their wages fall just 1.4%. In contrast, the wages of the bottom 90% (averaging $32,333 in 2013) rose a modest 0.4% (real hourly wages did grow modestly in 2013). Higher wage workers, those earning between the 90th and 99th%iles of wages (averaging $136,820 in 2013) fared the best, with real wages rising by 2.5%. Thus, wage inequality between high and middle/low wage workers grew even though those at the very top—the 1%ers—actually lost ground. David Cay Johnston wrote on this yesterday. Our analysis goes beyond his reporting by placing earners in%ile wage groups (bottom 90%, top 1%, etc.) and providing analyses of changes over the Great Recession’s downturn and recovery and the longer-term changes back to 1979. Economic Policy Institute What explains the dip in top 1% wages? Without access to the underlying data, this is a difficult task, but here are some thoughts. This stratum of wages is heavily influenced by executive pay trends and, therefore, by the ups and downs of the stock market, which executive pay has closely tracked for the last twenty years. Stock values, judged by the Dow Jones index and the S&amp;P 500, grew strongly (roughly 15%) in 2013, but CEO compensation for the largest firms grew a modest 2.8%. That does not explain a fall in wages though. The fall may be due to some income shifting, as tax rates did rise in 2013 (a new, higher top bracket at 39.6%, and an additional 0.9% Medicare tax on high earners). Those able to probably shifted compensation they would have received in 2013 into 2012 (when top one% wages grew 6.1%). The Wall Street Journal did report that there were “more bonuses paid by firms in December to avoid higher federal tax rates.” If so, then we can expect the 2013 dip in wages to be temporary, and for the wages of the top 1.0% to recover strongly in 2014. Even with these results for 2013, the recovery from the Great Recession (the years since 2009) remains highly unequal in terms of wage growth. The bottom 90% has seen a modest 0.7% loss of wages, while those in the top 1.0% gained 9.9%, and other high earners (between the 90thand 99th percentiles) gained 2.8%. Because the wages of the top 1.0% took the biggest fall in the 2007-09 downturn, however, the highest earners in 2013 had wages that were still 7.2% below their 2007 levels. The bottom 90% has not recovered yet either, with wages down 1.3% since 2007. The only group to make gains since 2007 was wage earners between the 90thand 99th percentiles, whose wages are up 2.5% since 2007. Economic Policy InstituteUnequal wage growth since 1979 The longer-term trends show tremendous disparity in wage growth. Wages of the top 1.0% rose 137.7% from 1979 to 2013, while those of the bottom 90% rose just 15.2%. Within that top 1.0%, the upper 0.1% has experienced even greater growth—289.6% since 1979 (after peaking at 362.5% in 2007). Higher wage earners below the top 1.0% but higher than the bottom 90% saw their wages grow between 37.2% (90th to 95th percentiles) and 59.5% (95th to 99th percentiles). Though average wages for the bottom 90% did grow modestly in 2013, they are still just a blip in the long-term trends of disparate wage growth when compared to the top 1.0%. FREE AppDownload

But even among those who can afford such a luxury, some islands are much more coveted than others. In their latest Candy GPS Report, Savills, Candy &amp; Candy, and Deutsche Asset Management ranked the world's top islands for real estate investment by ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNWI) — those with $30 million or more to their names. The report ranks the islands by the volume of UHNWI property holdings, transportation links to mainland markets, sources of capital and occupiers, tax regime, and real estate prices. Bermuda, with its large number of billionaire residents, proximity to the east coast of the US, and no income tax, topped the list of "A list" islands. "Most homes are understated, built in the 'Bermuda vernacular' of  painted stone with wooden shutters," the report says. "Tucker’s Town is the area of the island where the ultra-wealthy congregate, enjoying some of the island’s best views and adjacent to the island’s best golf courses."

The map below, also from the Candy report, shows islands in various categories, including leisure islands, which are popular for second (and third) homes; relocation islands, for with individuals seeking tax breaks; city-linked islands, which are in commuting distance to metropolitan areas; and "private island hotspots," where millionaires and billionaires buy up "the ultimate trophy asset," according to the report — an island all of their own.

Scott Olson/Getty Images)Sears, once America's golden retailer, is closing dozens of stores — including its flagship location in Chicago — to try and revive revenues. The company's sales have been falling since 2005, but its problems may stretch as far back as the late 1970s, when Sears executives characterized the retailer as a reflection of Middle America's "concerns," "problems and faults." "We are not a fashion store. We are not a store for the whimsical, nor the affluent," Sears executives wrote in an internal 1978 document obtained by Crain's Chicago Business. "We are not a discounter nor an avant-garde department store. We are not, by the standards of the trade press or any other group of bored observers, an exciting store." The document was part of a forward-looking five-year plan, referred to as "The Yellow Book." Crain's republished its 36-year-old report on the plan this week after the company announced it would be closing its flagship store in Chicago.  When "The Yellow Book" was written, the retailer was in its heyday. Three out of four Americans shopped at Sears annually, according to the company. Yet the company seemed resigned to let its competition take the lead.  "We are not a store that anticipates," executives wrote at the time. "We reflect the world of Middle America and all of its desires and concerns and problems and faults." Rance Crain, president of Crain Communications Inc. and editor-in-chief of Advertising Age, wrote in 2003 that "By not anticipating, Sears allowed retailers such as Wal-Mart, Home Depot and Target to carve out gigantic chunks of its bread-and-butter business. By not anticipating, Sears has become an imitator, and one that has ceased to even reflect its once cozy world of Middle America." Retail consultant Robin Lewis says the company continues to have a self-destructive view of itself today that has been perpetuated by CEO Eddie Lampert, who took over in 2005. "The recent closing of another Sears store is just another play out of Eddie's long established playbook, the playbook of a brilliant financier on how to manage a company down, and ultimately into liquidation," Lewis said in an emailed statement following news of Sears closing its flagship location in Chicago. Lewis says Lampert has been selling off the company's assets "to generate cash which he can then invest somewhere outside of the retail businesses."

In a letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook, Nader, a multiple-time Presidential candidate, wrote that Apple should stop catering to the demands of activist investors like Carl Icahn, and use its cash to pay workers more instead of buyback its stock.  In his letter, which was first published by The Wall Street Journal, Nader walks through a scenario where Apple halves the hours and doubles the salary of its Foxconn workers, costing the company $5.4 billion annually.  "If instead of buying back stock," Nader wrote, "Apple had used its excess $130 billion to endow a foundation to achieve these reforms, it would have paid out ­­ at a conservative five percent interest ­­$6.5 billion annually, enough to double wages and ensure a 40­ hour workweek for hundreds of thousands of iPhone workers, while leaving a $1.1 billion surplus as an annual budget for ensuring top­notch health, safety and environmental standards at Apple factories... Finally, some of Apple’s Chinese factory workers may become able to buy the iPhones they manufacture." "'Designed by Apple in California' has a nicer ring to it than 'Assembled by workers paid about a dollar per hour, working 11 ­hour shifts, and sleeping eight to a room in the Jabil Circuit corporate dormitories in Wuxi, China,'" Nader wrote in his letter. "But, no matter how you spin it on the iPhone packaging, you continue to turn away." Nader says the "corporatist" argument regarding pay for factory employees is that that's the price of cheaper iPhones. "This could be the case, if Apple was just barely profitable," Nader wrote. "But, as revealed in a recent letter responding to Carl Icahn's call for more stock buyback (you respond to [a] billionaire's pleas much more often than workers' pleas), Apple is planning to have repurchased $130 billion of its own shares by the end of next year. In short, Apple is so profitable that it does not know what to do with $130 billion except buy back stock from its shareholders to maybe boost its share price." Now, admittedly, Apple spends like, a lot of money buying back stock, but it's also sort of hard to take Nader's math and implementation at face value and say that it would definitely work.  But as we've highlighted before, even some of the big investors that Nader takes aim at know that the aggressive returning of money to shareholders, rather than employees or for investment in their business, is not advisable corporate behavior. And as Business Insider's Henry Blodget has written before, there is no "law of capitalism" that says a company must pay its employees as little as possible.  In its latest quarter, Apple took in $42 billion in revenue, sold more than 39 million iPhones, and had $155 billion in cash at the end of the quarter. Which, at the very least, seems like a lot.  You can read Nader's full letter, embedded below.         FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/John Schults“I can’t help it that I’m so popular.”High school never ends. On Friday, Reuters reported that relations between ECB president Mario Draghi and German leaders, most notably Bundesbank head Jens Weidmann "is totally rotten, it's beyond repair."  The feud over how to steer the European economy has become personal, according to the wire service.  This story led to a flurry of jokes about central bankers behaving like mean girls.

Corcoran Group Real EstateThe Hamptons home of late cable and telecommunications entrepreneur Richard Treibick has sold after just two months on the market, according to Candace Taylor at The Wall Street Journal. It had been listed for $34.99 million in August. The home is located on 31 acres of beachfront property in Sagaponack, in the Hamptons. The buyer remains unknown. Treibick, the former chairman of Cable Holdings and Cellular Information Systems, died earlier this year. The Sagaponack property was his summer home, with his primary residence in Greenwich, Conn.  Gary DePersia of the Corcoran Grouphadhas the listing. The estate is made up of two parcels: a 6,000-square foot house and 23 acres of adjacent farmland. Treibick leased part of the land to local farmers, using the rest to grow vegetables and berries. A barn, greenhouse, and shed sit on the property.Corcoran Group Real EstateWith seven bedrooms and multiple decks, the house itself is gorgeous.

 There's no question that Tesla is the most interesting car company in the world. Morgan Stanley lead auto analyst Adam Jonas has gone a step further and declared that Tesla is the most important car company in the world. So a lively moment was generated on Friday when, after Ford reported its third-quarter earnings, CEO Mark Fields fielded questions from Wall Street. Jonas suggested that Ford had probably obtained a Tesla Model S sedan and ... investigated its secrets. Fields was quick to affirm Jonas' suspicions. "We have driven the Model S, torn it down, put it back together, and driven it again," said Fields, who moved into the big chair at Ford in July. "We're very familiar with that product." "How," you might ask, "could Ford do such a thing?" Teardowns in the consumer-electronics realm are pretty routine. Anyone with the right tools can take their iPhone or iMac apart. A key follow-up feature of new product launches from Apple and everyone else is the near-immediate teardowns that happen as soon as the new stuff hits the market. Obviously, you need a bit more space, some more tools, and a fair amount of expertise to take apart a $100,000 luxury sedan (And put it back together!).  But then again, Ford builds cars for a living, so it's safe to assume that its engineers know what they're doing.  Tesla CEO Elon Musk isn't going to be terribly shocked to hear Fields acknowledge that Ford is a fan of the Model S, at a deeply gearhead-y level. Every other major carmaker that can get a Model S is going to tear it apart, as well. Teslas surely lie in pieces in the top-secret skunkworks garages of every automaker on earth. But what about Tesla? Do Musk &amp; Co. tear apart competing vehicles?  They really don't have to. Tesla is the electric car industry at this point. Its startup competition has fallen by the wayside, and the major carmakers have limited their electric-vehicle ambitions. Tesla can simply keep doing more of what it has been doing. Repetition — and continued execution on promises — is its own version of success, as long as the company doesn't forget the scrappy days of the 2008-2009 period, when it almost went under. Additionally, beyond its battery technology — which at this point is well understood — Tesla's innovation is more on the software and electric-charging infrastructure side. Big carmakers already know how to build a very expensive car that runs on electricity. It's also worth noting that Tesla isn't particularly invested in protecting its intellectual property from potential competitors. Earlier this year, Musk made the very unusual announcement that Tesla would be opening up its patents for all to see. Still, it's amazing to hear that a carmaker like Ford, with a history stretching back 100 years, is still intrigued enough by the new kid on the block to get one of that kid's cars and rip it to pieces, just to learn exactly how it works.   FREE AppDownload
BloombergLakshman Achuthan, cofounder of ECRIThe Weekly Leading Index (WLI) of the Economic Cycle Research Institute (ECRI) is at 131.9, down substantially from the previous week's 131.4. The WLI annualized growth indicator (WLIg) is at -0.1, down from 1.0 the previous week and its first negative print since August of 2012. ECRI has been at the center of a prolonged controversy since publicizing its recession call on September 30, 2011. The company had made the announcement to its private clients on September 21st. ECRI's cofounder and spokesman, Lakshman Achuthan, subsequently forecast that the recession would begin in Q1 2012, or Q2 at the latest. He later identified mid-2012 as the start of the recession. Over the past two years he has been a frequent guest on the likes of CNBC and Bloomberg TV. In recent months he has adjusted the company's position, identifying the recession's "epicenter" as the half-year spanning Q4 2012 and Q1 2013. Markets Pricing in More Fed Rate Hike Delay ECRI's latest topical focus is on the markets' Fed expectations. Here is the intro to their tease for non-subscribers: The ECRI Indicator Year-over-Year Below is a chart of ECRI's data that illustrates why the company's published proprietary indicator has lost credibility as a recession indicator. It's the smoothed year-over-year percent change since 2000 of their weekly leading index. I've highlighted the 2011 date of ECRI's original recession call and the hypothetical July 2012 business cycle peak, which the company previously claimed was the start of a recession. I've update the chart to include the "epicenter" (Achuthan's terminology) of the hypothetical recession.  Click for a larger image As for the disconnect between the stock market and the mid-2012 recession start date, Achuthan has repeatedly pointed out that the market can rise during recessions. See for example the 2:05 minute point in the November 4th video. The next chart gives us a visualization of the S&amp;P 500 during the nine recessions since the S&amp;P 500 was initiated in 1957. I've included a dotted line to show how the index has performed since ERIC's original July 2012 recession start date (now adjusted forward by three months).  Click for a larger image Here are two notable developments since ECRI's public recession call on September 30, 2011: Crushed by the Fed ECRI's recession forecast was doomed from the very day (September 21, 2011) that company alerted its private clients. On that same day the Fed announced Operation Twist, which was shortly thereafter followed by QE3.  Click for a larger image Eventually we will have another recession. But the aggressive monetary policy of the Fed appears to have dodged the recession bullet in ECRI's timeframe, regardless of the asset bubbles it may have created in doing so. For alternatives to ECRI's recession forecasting, see method developed by Anton and Georg Vrba: Appendix: A Closer Look at the ECRI Index Despite the increasing irrelevance of the ECRI's recession indicators in recent years, let's check them out. The first chart below shows the history of the Weekly Leading Index and highlights its current level.  Click for a larger image For a better understanding of the relationship of the WLI level to recessions, the next chart shows the data series in terms of the percent off the previous peak. In other words, a new weekly high registers at 100%, with subsequent declines plotted accordingly.  Click for a larger image As the chart above illustrates, only once has a recession ended without the index level achieving a new high -- the two recessions, commonly referred to as a "double-dip," in the early 1980s. Our current level is still off the most recent high, which was set back in June of 2007. We've exceeded the previously longest stretch between highs, which was from February 1973 to April 1978. But the index level rose steadily from the trough at the end of the 1973-1975 recession to reach its new high in 1978. The pattern in ECRI's indictor is quite different, and this has no doubt been a key factor in their business cycle analysis. The WLIg Metric The best known of ECRI's indexes is their growth calculation on the WLI. For a close look at this index in recent months, here's a snapshot of the data since 2000.  Click for a larger image Now let's step back and examine the complete series available to the public, which dates from 1967. ECRI's WLIg metric has had a respectable record for forecasting recessions and rebounds therefrom. The next chart shows the correlation between the WLI, GDP and recessions.  Click for a larger image The History of ECRI's Latest Recession Call ECRI's weekly leading index has become a major focus and source of controversy ever since September 30, 2011, when ECRI publicly announced that the U.S. is tipping into a recession, a call the Institute had announced to its private clients on September 21st. Here is an excerpt from the announcement: Year-over-Year Growth in the WLI Triggered by another ECRI commentary, Why Our Recession Call Stands, I now include a snapshot of the year-over-year growth of the WLI rather than ECRI's previously favored method of calculating the WLIg series from the underlying WLI (see the endnote below). Specifically the chart immediately below is the year-over-year change in the 4-week moving average of the WLI. The red dots highlight the YoY value for the month when recessions began.  Click for a larger image The WLI YoY is now at 2.2%, which is higher than the onset of six of the seven recessions in the chart timeframe, although well off its 7.5% interim high set in mid-June of last year. The second half of the early 1980s double dip, which was to some extent an engineered recession to break the back of inflation, is a conspicuous outlier in this series, and it started at a WLI YoY of 4.1%. Additional Sources for Recession Forecasts Dwaine van Vuuren, CEO of RecessionAlert.com, and his collaborators, including Georg Vrba and Franz Lischka, have developed a powerful recession forecasting methodology that shows promise of making forecasts with fewer false positives, which I take to include excessively long lead times, such as ECRI's September 2011 recession call. Here is today's update of Georg Vrba's analysis, which is explained in more detail in this article.  Click for a larger image Earlier Video Chronology of ECRI's Recession Call   Note: How to Calculate the Growth series from the Weekly Leading Index ECRI's weekly Excel spreadsheet includes the WLI and the Growth series, but the latter is a series of values without the underlying calculations. After a collaborative effort by Franz Lischka, Georg Vrba, Dwaine van Vuuren and Kishor Bhatia to model the calculation, Georg discovered the actual formula in a 1999 article published by Anirvan Banerji, the Chief Research Officer at ECRI: " The three Ps: simple tools for monitoring economic cycles - pronounced, pervasive and persistent economic indicators." Here is the formula: "MA2" = moving average of MA1 over the preceding 52 weeks "n"= 52/26.5 "m"= 100 WLIg = [m*(MA1/MA2)^n] – m FREE AppDownload
 Sears will probably not recover from its decades-long decline.  "As a retailer they're at the point of no return," said David Tawil, cofounder of Maglan Capital and an expert in distressed retail companies. "The real question now is when does it all end?"  Sears recently confirmed reports that it was planning to close more stores and lay off workers. The company, which has currently has 800 namesake stores and 1,100 Kmart stores, has lost $6 billion since 2012. Suppliers are growing concerned that they won't receive payments for merchandise.  Sears is lacking the cash or vision to make a turnaround possible, said Tawil, who has invested in many struggling retailers. "Sears hasn't invested any money into stores, which makes it difficult to retain or attract customers," Tawil said. "The company doesn't seem to have a plan to fix this, making a turnaround impossible."  Company chairman and CEO Eddie Lampert will need to spin off additional brands, as he did with Lands' End, to generate more cash, Tawil said.  While this strategy might raise money in the short-term, it also leaves Sears a skeleton of what it once was and does nothing to attract new customers. Sears denied the business is failing in a statement to Business Insider.  "Sears Holdings is embarking on a transformation of its business, from simply being focused on selling products in a traditional store network, to serving our members — wherever, whenever and however they want to shop," spokesman Howard Riefs said. "The progress we see in the engagement of our members in the Shop Your Way program and the traction we see in our Integrated Retail strategy give us confidence that we’re on the right track."  Retail analyst and author Robin Lewis believes Sears' inevitable decline started decades ago.  He says that Sears spent too much time investing in side businesses and ignored the competition.  "This did not have to be fatal; however, it actually starved those resources (capital and management) from the retail business, leaving it unable to respond and adapt to the needs of the evolving consumer and marketplace," Lewis writes.Morgan StanleySears and discount brand Kmart still have a considerable retail footprint, but the brand isn't investing in the future and plans to close more stores. Sears felt invincible, and it didn't respond to competitors like Wal-Mart, T.J. Maxx, and J.C. Penney Co., according to the book "The New Rules Of Retail," co-authored by Lewis and Michael Dart.  Between 1998 and 2010, the number of competitors within a 15-minute drive from any Sears grew to 4,300 stores from 1,400, according to Lewis.Sears could have fended off competitors by altering its strategy. Instead, the company became complacent, leading to a massive loss of market share.Nicholas EckhartA former Sears store in East Lake, Ohio, now sits empty. It is one of the hundreds of locations to close in recent years. Former Sears executive Steven Dennis believes the company will cease to exist in a few short years.  "Just about every action that has been taken over the last 10 years has weakened Sears competitive position," Dennis wrote on his blog. "And the horrific results make this plain for all to see. The world does not need a place to buy a wrench and a blouse and a toaster oven." Riefs told us that the brand is planning on making a comeback.  "We’re investing heavily in our future and we’d ask those watching to stay tuned," Riefs said.   FREE AppDownload

With a median salary of $201,000, alums of Harvard Law School earn more than any other graduate school after ten years in the workforce, according to a new survey from PayScale. The survey, which also studied 600 business schools and master's and doctorate programs, found that the most valuable U.S. graduate degree is in petroleum engineering. In fact, an education in petroleum engineering is so valuable that even a bachelor's degree in the subject is more valuable on average than any graduate degree, including law school and business school, according to PayScale editorial director Lydia Frank. An education in petroleum engineering is so valuable that even a bachelor's degree in the subject is more valuable on average than any graduate degree, including business school. Ranking graduate schools by income can be a sordid business, since it's seductive to conflate the income of alumni with the quality of their education. For example, Stanford and UC Berkeley, two universities separated by a 50-minute drive, have the honor of graduating the first and fourth richest business-school alums, according to PayScale. Both universities are exceptional, but their top-four finishes could equally be a function of their geography—their proximity to the Valley, the quality of its business connections, and the wage premium required to buy even a cardboard-box-sized apartment in San Francisco. The second caveat to clear out of the way before we present the graphs is that PayScale is a marvelous survey company, but respondents have a tendency to "lie up" in all sorts of income-based questionnaires. First, here is the top slice of PayScale's master list of graduate programs, which compares the median salaries of 600 law school, business school, master's, and Ph.D. programs. What you quickly gather is (a) elite law schools have the highest median salary; and (b) an astonishing number of them are in California. PayScale When PayScale shared its full dataset with The Atlantic, we lined up every degree—from computer science PhDs to strategic management MBAs—to determine the most lucrative way for twenty-somethings to go back to university for a second time. Rather remarkably, we found that a bachelor's degree in petroleum engineering is worth more than a graduate degree in law, business, computer science ... or anything else. There is more to life than money, one feels the need to say here, and PayScale does an admirable job measuring satisfaction and "meaning" derived from majors and graduate degrees. But for those who see grad school mainly as a money fount, it's useful to know where they can expect to make the most—namely, anything with the word petroleum. FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersFormer News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks makes a statement to the media in London(Reuters) - Rebekah Brooks, the former head of News Corp's  British newspaper division who was at the center of a phone hacking scandal, is visiting New York this week, exploring possible jobs, a company spokesman said on Friday. A protege of Murdoch, Brooks has been in meetings at News Corp's  headquarters, the publisher of The Wall Street Journal and New York Post, and elsewhere exploring job possibilities, according to the spokesman. "She and her family are here in the United States for a visit, reconnecting with friends and meeting with businesses as she explores and considers her professional future," said the spokesman. Brooks soared through the ranks at News Corp from a junior newsroom position to become chief executive officer of News International, the British publisher of The Sun and The Times, before stepping down in 2011 in the wake of the phone hacking scandal Brooks stood trial in London this summer for illegal conspiracy to hack into phones and authorizing illegal payments to public officials. A jury found her not guilty. The news of her trip to New York was first reported by Capital New York.  (Reporting by Jennifer Saba in New York; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe) FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Brendan McDermid US markets are open and stocks are higher. The Dow is up 33 points, the S&amp;P 500 is up 3 points, and the Nasdaq is up 12 points. Overnight, futures traded lower after news late Thursday that a New York City doctor who was treating patients in West Africa had contracted the virus. The quiet open for stocks comes at the end of what has been a big week for stocks, with the S&amp;P 500 gaining more than 3% so far this week. Stocks pared most of these losses through the morning and in early trade none of the major equity indexes were moving more than 0.2% in either direction. On the economic data front, new home sales disappointed, as home sales came in at an annualized selling rate of 467,000 in September, which was just below expectations. The big news in the report was that August's data, which showed new home sales surged 18% to an annualized rate of 504,000, was revised sharply lower to an annualized rate of 466,000. In stock news, the big mover was Amazon, which was down more than 6% in early trade after the online retailer last night reported a wider than expected loss per share.  FREE AppDownload
The latest trends in rail traffic showed more of the same that we’ve been seeing for the last few months. Interestingly, despite the Ebola scare and the brief Europe shock, there was no substantive change in rail trends. The latest weekly reading came in at 3% which is just below the 12 week moving average of 4.3%.  That’s down marginally over the last few months, but still a strong reading in the grand scheme of things.  Via AAR: “WASHINGTON, D.C. – Oct. 23, 2014 – The Association of American Railroads (AAR) today reported increased U.S. rail traffic for the week ending Oct. 18, 2014 with 297,130 total carloads, up 2.7 percent compared with the same week last year.

jekemp / Flickr New home sales were flat in September after a big downward revision to August's report. New home sales rose 0.2% to an annualized pace of 467,000 in September, while August's blowout number was revised down to a pace of 466,000 from a prior report of 504,000.  Expectations were for new home sales to fall 6.8% in September to an annualized selling rate of 470,000, down from August's 18% increase to an annualized rate of 504,000.  According to the latest report from the Census, the median home sales price in September was $259,000 and the average was $313,200.  The report also showed that the current rate of sales represents 5.3 months supply at the current sales rate. In a note to clients following the report, Ian Shepherdson at Pantheon Macro wrote, "In one line: Revisions mean no clear breakout from the range yet." Shepherdson added, " Given the size and frequency of large revisions to the data, we wonder why the numbers are published so early; they'd be much more reliable if they were released with a longer delay. Taking the revisions into account, we cannot now say with any conviction that sales have broken definitively above the 400-to-460K trend in place since late 2012, though the rebound in the NAHB survey over the summer suggests it is just a matter of time."

To outsiders, Wall Street is a manic, dangerous and ridiculous republic unto itself – a sort of bizarro world where nothing adds up and common sense is virtually inapplicable. Consider the following insane things that we believe on Wall Street, that make no sense whatsoever in the real world: 1. Falling gas and home heating prices are a bad thing 2. Layoffs are great news, the more the better 3. Billionaires from Greenwich, CT can understand the customers of JC Penney, Olive Garden, K-Mart and Sears 4. A company is plagued by the fact that it holds over $100 billion in cash 5. Some companies have to earn a specific profit – to the penny – every quarter but others shouldn’t dare even think about profits 6. Wars, weather, fashion trends and elections can be reliably predicted 7. It’s reasonable for the value of a business to fluctuate by 5 to 10 percent within every eight hour period 8. It’s possible to guess the amount of people who will get or lose a job each month in a nation of 300 million 9. The person who leads a company is worth 400 times more than the average person who works there 10. A company selling 10 million cars a year is worth $50 billion, but another company selling 40,000 cars a year is worth $30 billion because its growing faster Away from Wall Street, no one believes in any of this stuff. It’s inconceivable. On Wall Street, these are core tenets of our collective philosophy. No wonder everyone else thinks we’re insane. FREE AppDownload

There is inflation in the use of "deflation." Tom McClellan, editor of the McClellan Market Report, wrote in a post on Thursday that the number of reports about impending deflation have been surging, which could mean the opposite is coming to the market. "I cannot believe the volume of the news stories I am seeing in the financial media, with people worrying about impending deflation," McClellan wrote. "And as any card-carrying contrarian knows, when a topic gets too popular, you are near a turning point." Over the last several months, worries about deflation — or falling prices, which economists say indicates a contracting, not expanding, economy — particularly in the eurozone, has been the story in markets. A number of analysts, central bankers, market participants, and yes, journalists, have noted that a variety of measures — from consumer price indexes to "breakevens" — have been indicating that we are much closer to deflation than inflation. As McClellan writes, "The basic point for beginning contrarians is to disbelieve most of whatever you are hearing repeated in the financial media. And the more it is being repeated, the more you should disbelieve it. Learn to trust your own analysis, rather than listening to the talking head du jour on TV, even if it is me." The appearance of "deflation" in news stories is at its highest level since October 2010, and as McClellan sees it, this might put us closer to the opposite occurring in the economy.  McClellan Financial Publications FREE AppDownload
Suzanne Plunkett/ReutersBoE deputy governor for monetary policy, Ben BroadbentBank of England deputy governor for monetary policy Ben Broadbent gave a speech this Thursday at the Society of Business Economists Annual Conference. His message was simple: stop blaming central banks for high asset prices. There's been a long-term decline in the risk-free rate of interest, he said. But you know what? It's a secular decline, and monetary policy isn't the only thing affecting markets.  "Autonomous changes in monetary policy certainly can have an impact on asset prices,"he said. "But that does not mean they’re the only thing that actually does so." He points to three things:  1) Inflation has been relatively stable, even as the BoE's policy rate has plummeted. 2) Long-term real interest rates have declined along with short-term real interest rates. Therefore, "just as a matter of principle, it’s hard to see how pure monetary disturbances – including any independent decisions of monetary policy makers – can have very enduring influences on real things, including real interest rates (that’s particularly true for monetary authorities in relatively small and open economies like the UK)." 3) Finally, "...where we’re able to isolate autonomous (or at least unexpected) shifts in official interest rates, they don’t seem to produce any reaction in longer-term real forward rates." Bank of EnglandFrom Broadbent's speechHe does say that quantitative easing (QE) is different and definitely did have significant effects. However, "most of the decline in longer-term real interest rates occurred before the crisis." If it isn't easy money from the central banks, what's causing the decline in real interest rates? Higher saving, maybe. And potentially uncertainty about future economic growth. Then, of course, there's everybody's new favorite reason: "The debate about 'secular stagnation' – the idea that the equilibrium real interest rate is sufficiently negative to be out of reach of monetary policy (given the zero lower bound) – has brought forth more potential factors still, including population aging, a shift toward less capital-intensive production and institutional changes that have increased the demand for safe assets." Broadbent's conclusion is that no one is really sure why real interest rates have declined. But it's not because of monetary policy. That means it's probably because of real economic changes, and it's time to pay attention. FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/John Kolesidis25 European banks are about to fail the ECB's comprehensive assessment, according to Bloomberg. it's the biggest test of this sort ever done by the European Central Bank. The full results are announced Sunday. Bloomberg say about 10 of these banks will have to plug capital shortfalls. It's not clear which of these are the same banks that Reuters reported would fail stress tests on Wednesday. The ECB says it won't comment on speculation, and doesn't finalise the results of the tests until its governing council has approved them this weekend, but the assessments have now been going on for months and it's just days from released. It's a little muddled because on the same day that the ECB releases the results of their comprehensive assessment, the European Banking Authority will release the results of its stress tests.  But the inclusion of the 130 figure shows that this is the ECB's assessment. Markets are already reacting.

Dina Spector/Google Maps  Craig Spencer, a 33-year-old doctor, is the first person found to have Ebola in New York City.  Since Spencer was rushed to Manhattan's Bellevue Hospital on Thursday, immediately after showing symptoms, health officials have been retracing his steps and working to identify anyone the patient may have come into contact with since returning to the United States from Guinea on Oct. 17.  As a member of Doctors Without Borders, Spencer had been treating Ebola patients in Guinea, one of the three West African countries hit hardest by the Ebola epidemic.  At a news conference on Thursday night, Mayor Bill de Blasio urged New Yorkers not be alarmed.  Ebola patients cannot spread the virus until they begin showing symptoms. Ebola is transmitted only through contact with an infected person's blood or other bodily fluids, and not through casual contact.  Here's a quick timeline of the events shortly before the time Spencer received his diagnosis, and where he traveled. Oct. 14: Spencer left Guinea.  Oct 17: The doctor arrived at John F. Kennedy airport. He displayed no symptoms at the time he left Guinea and throughout his journey home and to his Harlem apartment on West 147th street.   Tuesday, Oct. 21: Spencer reported feeling tired. He had been checking his temperature twice a day after leaving Guinea.  Wednesday, Oct. 22: Spencer was out and about: He went on a three-mile jog, took the A, 1, and L trains, and visited a bowling alley in Williamsburg. Aside from fatigue, Spencer was feeling well.  Thursday, Oct. 23: Spencer displayed the first Ebola symptoms, including a fever of 100.3 degrees, between 10 and 11 a.m. He immediately contacted Doctors Without Borders, which contacted the state health department.  The patient is currently at Bellevue Hospital, one of eight in New York State that has been designated as a facility to handle Ebola cases.  So far, the city's "disease detectives" have determined that three people he had contact with are potentially at risk. Those people — his fiancee and two friends — have been placed in isolation. Officials initially had the driver of his Uber taxi on the list as a fourth contact but determined he was not at risk.
It’s a simple fact: Most countries in the Western world don’t take in nearly as much money as they spend. And so they borrow. By the billions. Make that trillions. And if concerns about the unsustainability of national debts are nothing new, neither is the fact that we still can’t seem to stop ourselves from continuing to let the IOUs pile up. Some say that’s just finance. Others consider it a moral problem, and point out that we’re borrowing from – and bankrupting – our children and grandchildren without their consent. Count Laurence J. Kotlikoff, an economics professor at Boston University, among the latter group. Co-author of the 2012 book “The Clash of Generations: Saving Ourselves, Our Kids, and Our Economy,” Kotlikoff, 63, recently sat down with Credit Suisse to talk about our crimes against posterity, the deceptive accounting of government, and the folly of our financial future.  Credit Suisse: Professor Kotlikoff, you warn of a “clash of generations.” Can you elaborate?  Laurence J. Kotlikoff: We’re waging a war against our own children. And the worst of it is that we’re winning.It’s not being waged with tanks and howitzers, of course. It’s a war of funding shortfalls and ever increasing consumption by older people at the expense of coming generations. We’ve turned retirement into a well-paid, long-term occupation.It’s extremely unfair to our children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. We’re burdening them with massive government debt in order to pay for that generosity. These unfunded bills will stretch into eternity, and our children won’t be able to pay them. CS: What’s the first step we can take to avoid that clash? LK: First, we need to acknowledge how dire the situation is. When private individuals or companies are unable to pay their bills, they’re bankrupt. And when countries are unable to pay their bills, they’re bankrupt, too – even if they print money and other countries are still willing to accept it. Consider my country, the United States. It’s flat broke – and we don’t even know it. The American government isn’t even capable of calculating our fiscal gap as it stretches into infinity. And it isn’t willing to reveal whether its investments will be able to cover the explicit and implicit liabilities of the future. This is deceptive accounting, worse than Bernie Madoff’s Ponzi scheme or Enron’s accounting fraud. CS: Could you explain what you mean by a fiscal gap? LK: The fiscal gap is the government’s credit card bill. It’s the difference between expected future income and a country’s total anticipated expenditures. The problem isn’t even the official government debt that is listed in official statistics. The problem is the hidden debts, the implicit commitments that are deliberately kept out of the government’s books. If we add these implicit commitments to Social Security and healthcare, the fiscal gap of the United States exceeds that of Greece or Spain. CS: How large is it?  LK: The American government has $202 trillion less than it needs to fund all of the commitments it has made to the American people. The gap is 12 times as large as our GDP. Most Western industrialized countries are faced with a similarly bleak situation. The pension systems of most industrialized countries are nothing but pyramid schemes that have been in place for decades. They will collapse like a house of cards as soon as younger people are no longer willing to pay the bill – or are unable to do so. CS: You’re also proposing something no politician ever would, which is to take something away from the elderly. How do you come to that point of view?  LK: In 1960, the average 80-year-old consumed roughly two-thirds as much as the average 30-year-old. Today, 80-year-olds consume 50 percent more than 30-year-olds. Members of the older generation are consuming more than they should. Period. We need to cut entitlements for the older generation. But there are no painless solutions. To close the fiscal gap, the American government would have to immediately and permanently raise taxes by 57 percent or cut all benefits by 37 percent. And we need to radically reform and simplify our tax, healthcare and Social Security systems.. CS: Can you be more specific?  LK: I propose abolishing our existing system of retirement provision and replacing it with a system of personal security accounts. All accrued benefits would be guaranteed by the state and paid as they come due. Then, all workers would be required to contribute 8 percent of their pay to a personal security account. The account balances would be invested by a computer in a global index fund of stocks, bonds and real estate. When people are between ages 60 and 70, the same computer would convert their account balances into annuities based on average life expectancy at that time. CS: How much money could this approach save? LK: In the United States, approximately $60 trillion in retirement benefits alone. CS: Would today’s young people then receive benefits that are lower than those of today’s retirees? LK: Substantially lower, yes. Lower than the benefits they have been falsely promised, which they never would have received in any case. CS: Do you believe politicians are ready to pursue new solutions? LK: No, it’s already too late. That’s something they should have done 30 or 40 years ago. I no longer believe that either the Republicans or the Democrats will take the necessary action. CS: So is the middle class finished? LK: The American middle class is doomed. We used to promote the American dream: Our children would do better than we have. Increasingly, the American dream is becoming a nightmare. It’s a foreseeable disaster, but we’re not taking the necessary steps to prevent it. This is tragic – and irresponsible.

Lakeland Industries, which makes hazmat suits, were up as much as 19% in pre-market trade on Friday after the first case of Ebola was confirmed in New York City on Thursday. In late trade on Thursday, after reports that a doctor who had been treating Ebola patients in West Africa had been taken to the hospital with Ebola-like symptoms, shares of Lakeland spiked higher and closed up 16%. On Thursday night, the patient was confirmed to have tested positive for Ebola, and on Friday morning Lakeland was extending its gains. Shares of Lakeland have been going absolutely nuts over the last couple weeks, as the first case of Ebola contracted in the US sent to stock from below $10 to nearly $30 in just a few trading days. The stock has come well off that high in the last couple days, but over the last three months, shares are still up well over 100%.  Here's the chart showing Thursday's late-day spike in Lakeland shares.

It reported disappointing earnings Thursday night, whiffing on revenue and EPS expectations. It provided weaker revenue guidance than expected. It also forecast a big loss for the holiday quarter. There's more: It took a $170 million write-down related to the Fire phone, and it said it had $83 million in unsold Fire phones laying around. This confirms what everyone thought — the Fire phone is a flop. Basically, there was very little that was good for the company in the report.

AP/Ann Heisenfelt Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton at a get-out-the-vote rally in support for Minnesota Democrats.Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton struck a populist tone in a campaign pitch Thursday night. According to Politico, the former secretary of state took multiple shots at "big banks" as she urged voters to support Sen. Al Franken (D-Minnesota). "Al has pushed for more and better oversight of the big banks and risky financial activity," Clinton reportedly said. "And there's more work for him to do." Clinton, whom some liberals accuse of being too cozy with Wall Street, proceeded to tick off a laundry list of financial reforms where there's still "a lot of unfinished business." "Even before the big [economic] meltdown, a lot of us were calling for regulating derivatives and other complex financial products, closing the carried-interest loophole, getting control of skyrocketing CEO pay, addressing other excesses, and we’ve made progress," she said. "But there's a lot of unfinished business to make sure we don't end up once again with big banks taking big risks and leaving taxpayers holding the bag." FREE AppDownload

FTClick to enlarge.The European Union on Friday released new calculations on the contributions to its budget by member states. Payments are linked to a percentage of GDP, which changes over time, hence the recalculation. As the FT reported, the UK has been hit worst by the new provisional calculations as its economic growth spurt has left the country facing a bill of €2.1 billion ($2.7 billion) to be paid by December. Elsewhere, sluggish growth in France and Germany will see them receive sizeable rebates of €1 billion and €780 million respectively, while austerity-battered Greece is being asked to pay an extra €90 million. Although British policymakers will have expected an adjustment, the news comes at a particularly sensitive time, with the anti-EU UK Independence Party gaining ground in the country. Prime Minister David Cameron faces an uphill battle to avoid a second humiliating defeat to UKIP in as many months in a by-election next month in Rochester and Strood. Cameron's Conservative Party trails 13 points in the polls despite his promise to "throw everything we have" at the campaign. Receiving a huge bill from Europe less than a month before the vote will do nothing to help his chances. At a press conference Friday the Prime Minister said: "I am not paying that bill on the first of December. If people think I am going to, they have got another thing coming." FREE AppDownload
The high-yield sell-off during the third quarter follows the pattern seen in 2004. After the Federal Reserve first signaled a withdrawal of accommodation in 2004, the Credit Suisse High-Yield Index fell in the 20 weeks leading up to the June hike before resuming its bull run through the end of the year. This year, prices fell in the months leading up to the October end of quantitative easing, which marks the start of less accommodative monetary policy. If history repeats itself, high-yield bond prices should rebound in the fourth quarter. Guggenheim Partners FREE AppDownload

Billionaire investor Carl Icahn says the struggling Trump Taj Mahal casino "will almost certainly close." The would-be purchaser of the casino told the Associated Press on Thursday night that the casino's finances were dire. Four of Atlantic City's 12 casinos have closed this year, and the Taj Mahal would be the fifth. Icahn, sounding very much like a man growing tired of the whole topic, said that even though he wouldn't back out of a deal he made with owner Trump Entertainment Resorts to acquire the Taj Mahal and pump $100 million into it, he wishes he never answered the phone when the company first called him about it. "One overriding fact is perfectly clear: The Taj is quickly running out of money and will almost certainly close," Icahn told the AP. "Reprehensibly, the union, instead of working with, and trying to help, the company to keep the Taj alive, is instead doing everything to destroy the possibility of saving the jobs of over 3,000 employees." Union members said they would picket outside the casino on Friday night to protest a court-ordered termination of employees' healthcare and pension plans. "It's really hard to know what to believe from him anymore," Bob McDevitt, president of Local 54 of the Unite-HERE union, said of Icahn. "It's pretty bizarre to say you want to help, when you start out as a lone wolf ripping away workers' livelihood and dignity. Everyone else in this city and state is working together to move Atlantic City forward. You can't start by moving thousands of people backwards." Trump Entertainment has declined to comment. It had threatened to close the Taj Mahal on Nov. 13 if it didn't get a judge to free it from making healthcare and pension payments for the casino's workers. It now promises to keep the casino open at least through November. REUTERS/Jason ReedA jogger runs past the Trump Taj Mahal Casino on the boardwalk at Atlantic City, New Jersey, on Aug. 27, 2011. For decades Atlantic City enjoyed a monopoly on gambling on the east coast. But as casinos popped up in neighboring states, gamblers found they no longer needed to drive or ride buses to New Jersey to play the slots or table games. Atlantic City's casino revenue has fallen from $5.2 billion in 2006 to $2.86 billion last year, and it will be considerably less this year with the closures of at least a third of its casinos. Trump Entertainment Resorts acknowledges its finances are dire but says it is doing everything it can to preserve the Taj Mahal and the jobs. It previously warned it was in danger of running out of money in early December, before it got a bankruptcy court judge to cancel its contract with Local 54 of Unite-HERE. The move saves the company $14.6 million a year. Icahn also owns Atlantic City's Tropicana Casino and Resort, which he bought out of bankruptcy in 2010. He said he was approached by Trump Entertainment about canceling the $286 million in company debt he owns and converting that into ownership of the Taj Mahal. The plan involves him investing $100 million into the casino but only if the union contract is canceled and if the state contributes $175 million in aid — a request already rejected by state Senate President Steve Sweeney. An earlier plan, since dropped, also called on Atlantic City to grant large tax breaks to the company. Icahn said he had "walked into a hornet's nest here." "Frankly, several of my advisers have told me that if the city and the state did not come up with the money, they'd be doing me a large favor," Icahn said. "Even if we get the concessions from the city and the state, we're going to lose a lot of money. Everybody thinks I'm trying very hard to do this. I'm not." ___ Wayne Parry can be reached at http://twitter.com/WayneParryAC Copyright (2014) Associated Press. All rights reserved.

REUTERS/Susana VeraAbandoned housing in Spain(Reuters) - Social housing in Spain is not generous. Rented social housing makes up just 2 percent of all residential property compared with 18 percent in Britain and 17 percent in France, according to the European Federation of Public, Cooperative and Social Housing. The country’s investment in social housing is just 0.79 percent of Gross Domestic Product, about half the European average, according to Human Rights Watch. Rather than offer subsidies to help people rent cheaply, Spain’s government has focused on helping people to buy. Social housing tenants have typically rented for around 10 years and then been given the option to buy. The property crash has torpedoed that policy. Rent-to-buy agreements set the purchase price at the start of the rental lease. When prices rise, that works. But any flats coming up for sale now were priced at the height of the boom. Today's buyers would likely pay above a property’s current market value. (Edited by Sara Ledwith) FREE AppDownload
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone leaders sought on Friday to bridge stark differences over how to avoid economic stagnation and deflation in the bloc, with Germany facing fresh calls to soften its budget rigor and spend more. With a U.S.-style bond-buying plan by the European Central Bank off the table for now, the bloc has few options, leaving other euro zone leaders to tread a careful line between the opposing growth and austerity camps. "It's very important to find a balance between growth and stability," Finland's Prime Minister Alex Stubb said as he arrived at the second day of an EU summit at which ECB President Mario Draghi will address leaders. After the euro zone's revival came to a halt in the second quarter, France and Italy want to shift course away from the spending cuts that marked the bloc's response to 2009-2012 crisis, but Germany says debt discipline must continue. The euro zone's poor performance is becoming a wider concern, with the United States and the International Monetary Fund worrying that the bloc that makes up a fifth of the world economy is a drag on global prosperity. The debate is complicated by EU rules that seek to keep country's public finances in order and Germany's promise to balance its books next year for the first time since 1969. The European Union's top economic official renewed the charge against Berlin, saying that without investment the future was bleak for Europe's biggest economy, even if it is stronger than most. "All euro area countries have shortages in potential growth, including Germany," said Jyrki Katainen, the European Commissioner who will become the bloc's growth tsar from November, tasked with bringing down near record unemployment and sinking investment. "Germany's potential growth is currently 1.5 (percent). This is far too low," he told reporters Diplomats say the euro zone may be moving towards a bargain where France and Italy, the second and third biggest euro zone economies, make new commitments to reform in return for more spending room in their budgets. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi is proposing tax cuts to get households spending again, as his country is suffering its third recession since 2008. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who chairs the meetings of euro zone finance ministers, said that reforms were key. "Paris and in Rome are quite ambitious in terms of reforms and modernizing their societies, the government and the economy," Dijsselbloem said. "I think that's crucial." The European Commission, which acts as a budget policeman for the euro zone, has until next Wednesday to reject any 2015 budgets with France's in the spotlight. Even if it does so, changes made by Paris and Rome are likely to be small, officials say. "We need to look at each case separately, keeping in view the Stability and Growth Pact rules and the need to maintain a responsible fiscal policy," said Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite, whose country joins the euro zone next year. "Austerity needs to be in place, and in parallel we need to invest," she said. Such declarations on budget discipline could provide cover for the ECB to do more to fend off the deflation that would make it even harder for the euro zone to bring down its debts. Many investors want to see the ECB launch a U.S.-style sovereign-bond buying program that could act as a proxy for a government stimulus. But Draghi faces resistance from some, notably Germany, because the euro zone is banned from directly financing governments. (Additional reporting by Paul Taylor and Philip Blenkinsop.

Dan Mullan / Stringer / Getty ImagesBarclays thinks that investors have overblown the damage done to the eurozone's economy and that several sectors are ripe for a rebound. On Friday, the bank named 25 European companies that are ripe for a resurgence if the outlook for Europe improves: "We believe that European equity markets are discounting an outlook for the economy that is more pessimistic than warranted. The European equity risk premium is now near the highs seen during the sovereign debt crisis and the financial crisis. Relative to credit markets too, European stocks are now more cheaply priced than any time in the last decade. Both measures suggest that equity investors are pricing in an adverse economic outcome in the euro area." The bank has offered up a list of "fallen angels": 25 European stocks it argues have been "unfairly punished" during the last month's volatility and sell-off. In particular, economists looked at companies that have declined in price since Sept. 19, 2014, — some by more than 10% — but which have also boosted their earnings forecast since then.  Here's the full list:  Barclays Research, DataStream, MSCI FREE AppDownload

REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon">Thomson ReutersWorkers labour at a construction site in BeijingBy Sumanta Dey BANGALORE (Reuters) - Emerging Asia will contribute less to the global economy in 2015 than was expected just months ago as a slowdown in China drags on growth in the region, partially offset by acceleration in the United States, Reuters polls showed. Until recently the primary engine of global growth, most Asian economies have slowed, hamstrung by erratic exports, sluggish domestic demand, capital outflows and political and policy uncertainty. At the same time, many of Asia's major trading partners in the West are grappling with disinflation and weak demand, making it difficult for central banks there to move away from aggressive monetary stimulus. Estimates for 2015 GDP growth were either cut or left unchanged for nine Asian countries in the latest poll of over 200 economists conducted over the past week, with Hong Kong, Indonesia and Singapore bearing the brunt of the downgrades. India, Malaysia and Thailand were the few economies for which economists made slight upgrades to growth projections. These latest lacklustre forecasts follow a similarly tepid performance this year, during which China's economy slumped to its slowest pace of growth since the global financial crisis. "The Chinese economy is unbalanced at present with an excess of investment, much of which has been financed via debt," said Jay Bryson, global economist at Wells Fargo. "The slowdown that is under way in China is partially policy-induced, and the days of double-digit Chinese economic growth appear to be a thing of the past." China's economy is expected to expand 7.4 percent this year, narrowly missing the government's 7.5 percent annual target, as Beijing tries to derive more future growth from consumer demand rather than exports. In 2015, economists predict growth to slow further to 7.1 percent. [ECILT/CN] Also among the primary reasons for the protracted slowdown is the risk that China's overheated property market might crash, triggering ripple effects through a highly leveraged economy and further dragging on consumer demand. While Beijing has undertaken targeted stimulus to ease business lending, liquidity and housing regulations, economists do not expect a major shift in policy or lower interest rates from the People's Bank of China. Effects from a slowdown in the world's second largest economy have trickled through to South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore and Indonesia, with growth estimates downgraded in the latest survey. India, Asia's third largest economy, was among the few bright spots. Growth there is expected to pick up to its fastest pace this fiscal year since 2010-11 on the view that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will unveil much needed reforms to attract investment.

Owen Sweeney/Invision/APLinkin Park were playing in Camden, NJ, on Aug. 15Most often trading is a solitary business. A trader works in a room, by themselves, surrounded by screens with market prices, market news, a radio, a television tuned to the ABC, Sky, CNBC (or all three), as your only companions. When I'm not at BI's Sydney office, I'm one of those lone trader/writers working from my office at the back of the house surrounded by Michael Rowland, La Trioli and the gang on ABC24 along with Brooke Corte, Carson Scott and the team at Sky Business with Newsradio blaring in the background. But often, when the news is boring or I need to really focus on my trading and writing, I hit mute on everything and crank up the music. I was an 80s New Romantic listening to Spandau Ballet, Thompson Twins and Depeche Mode, although I loved Killing Joke and of course Iron Maiden and Motley Crue. I shook that off in the 90s with Pearl Jam and Nirvana, moved to Incubus and Foo Fighters, with a little Lenny Kravitz in the late 90s but in the end it seems my roots are firmly planted in the heavier stuff - it relaxes me. Here are the top 14 songs (and the associated albums) I like to listen to when I'm trading. You'll notice a bit of a theme: From the very first second I heard this song I was hooked. It's still probably my favourite song of all time. Linking Park and Transformers together - need I say more? The boys were back with this album and the title track, like Numb, caught me from the first second. When I play this song I play this album and I saw them live in Sydney on the tour. Brilliant. Just brilliant. Circus Animals by Cold Chisel was the first album I ever bought and this song was and the concert at Red Rock was the first thing I ever recorded on mum and dad's VCR. It is still one of the great concerts. It is fashionable to hate Nickelback and I certainly don't play some songs in earshot of the kids or my wife but lets face it - Nickelback rock. I challenge one to stand still when they hear this song. Like Linkin Park, from the moment I heard my first song by the boys from La Plata I was hooked. This is one of my favorites and, as well as trading music, Good Charlotte is great when I'm on the ride-on mower doing the yard. I love New York, I love this song. It's just on of those bits of music I could listen too in high rotation for ages. My wife told me what this song was about a few weeks back. I had no idea and while I sometimes listen to the Piano Man album when I'm writing, Captain Jack stands out as a classic. Hooked from the very start - Just a great song. He's back! If you haven't heard this song or the album by the same name do yourself a favour. It sets the tone nicely for non-farm payrolls too. Utopia is the album of the year for me and Price of Fame, my favourite song. There is a language warning needed with this one, but if "Still Rap" isn't the anthem for traders well... The Heist was probably the album of 2012 and Thrift Shop its best song. I have spend countless hours either standing at my desk or on the ride on listening to this. (NSFW) Surely I don't need to say anything here, do I? But OK, I had to chose one, so it's Monkey Wrench. And here's the Spotify version:  And the music I'm listening to while I wrote this? Avicii, True. Now before you tell me I've missed out on Back in Black, or Whole Lotta Love, this is my list, not some older brother's list or some conventional notion of what is supposed to be good. Like trading, this is my system. What's your list look like? This article originally appeared at Business Insider Australia.  Copyright 2014. FREE AppDownload
The current massive wave of cashed-up investors from China throwing money at Australian residential property is not primarily motivated by immediate rental returns or eventual profits. A study by Hong Kong-based equity brokers CLSA, including data from more than 50 meetings with industry contacts, says the phenomenal investment will continue for at least another three years. As this chart shows, China is now the number 1 source of foreign-capital investment in Australian real estate. CLSA says anecdotal evidence indicates that foreign investment from China has continued to increase in 2014. "There are a number of drivers behind the growing interest - the most important of which have little to do with simple investment choices," CLSA says in its report, The Magic Dragon - Chinese Investment and Oz Housing. A key reason is increasing emigration options, by having property in the preferred destination country. FIRB, CLSA Diversifying investment portfolios is another important motive. This is perhaps an euphemism for getting capital out of China as a mechanism for wealthy Chinese to mitigate the perceived economic and political risk of living in, and having wealth tied up in the PRC. Both these sit ahead of simple investment returns. CLSA says analysis of state-based foreign investment data confirms what we know anecdotally, that New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria have become the overwhelming destinations of choice for residential property investment. Chinese residents want to emigrate to English-speaking countries, where there is a strong common law process, says CLSA. A good education system is essential and, as China's pollution problems escalate, a clean environment is becoming more important. ABS, CLSA About 45% of the 70 million people in the top-income bracket in China express intentions to emigrate. Building investments outside of China is an important step in keeping open emigration options. And given the obsession with property investment, it is only logical that the purchase of property is key to that strategy. Australia is the number 2 destination behind Canada, which in February this year implemented restrictions on foreign investment and immigration. The main driver for new property purchases is apartments, either newly constructed or off the plan. The local real estate industry is capitalizing on the new wave. Sydney-based real estate agent John McGrath, which sold $7 billion of residential property in 2013, recently established a China desk and now publishes a Chinese language version of the McGrath Magazine. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is concerned about the level of investor lending but there are signs that the wave of money from China will be long lasting. CLSA compares the current wave of Chinese investment with the Japanese real-estate investment in the late 1980s. In the late 1980s and early 1990s there was a large and rapid buildup of Japanese investment into Australian property which was followed by an even more rapid decline and exit from the investments. Japanese investment in Australian property rose from close to zero in the 1980s to $65 billion, only to collapse by 70% in 1992. "Our conclusion is that this time there are marked differences, the most obvious being that individuals are driving the Chinese investment cycle, where the motivating factor is not financial, but for asset diversification and potential emigration," CLSA says.

The Russian ruble has fallen further against the dollar and the euro hitting record new lows against the currencies. BloombergRuble versus the dollar. BloombergRuble versus the euro. Russia's currency has been put under pressure by a combination of falling oil prices and fears on Friday over a possible sovereign debt downgrade by Standard &amp; Poor’s. The ratings agency currently has a BBB- on Russia, only one grade above junk. A further downgrade would push it into junk territory, most likely increasing the country's borrowing costs at a time when it is already struggling to meet budget targets because of plunging commodity revenues. If the oil price continues to slide, analysts see the country falling into a recession. The Russian central bank has spent over $15 billion in October to prop up the currency, burning through Russia's foreign exchange reserves but so far has been unable to halt the slide.   FREE AppDownload

Thomson ReutersContainers are pictured at the ITS terminal at the Port of Long BeachCHICAGO/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A shortage of transportation equipment and possible labor disruptions at <U+200B>the Los Angeles/Long Beach port complex, <U+200B>the nation's busiest, is delaying shipping containers for up to three weeks, threatening timely delivery to retailers for the holiday season. The delays are affecting retailers including JC Penney Co &lt;jcp.n&gt;, Macy's Inc &lt;m.n&gt;, Kohl's Corp &lt;kss.n&gt; Nordstrom Inc &lt;jwn.n&gt;, American Eagle &lt;aeo.n&gt;, Ralph Lauren &lt;rl.n&gt; and Carter's &lt;cri.n&gt;, according to three people with direct knowledge of the situation. Retail giant Wal-mart Stores Inc &lt;wmt.n&gt;, recently diverted 300 shipment containers to Oakland to avoid the congestion, one person said. Wal-Mart declined comment. The problem stems from a shortage of trucking equipment, called chassis, but the National Retail Federation in a statement said protracted labor negotiations were an issue, too. The International Longshore and Warehouse Union declined comment on whether talks were having an effect. Most retailers acknowledged the delays at the key ports for shipments from Asia, but said they did not anticipate product shortages during the holidays. Even so, any delay can derail a finely calibrated just-in-time inventory control system, making it costlier for retailers to put merchandise on the shelves. "It's a domino effect," said Nate Herman, vice president of international trade at the American Apparel and Footwear Association. "When there is an interruption, things degenerate quickly." With major port contracts up for renewal this year, retailers including Wal-Mart ordered early and prompted a surge of deliveries in June and July, port statistics show. But significant volume still arrived during the traditional August-October period that precedes the November-January holiday shopping season. "There will be a scramble to restock shelves this holiday season," said Mark Hirzel, president of the Los Angeles Customs Brokers and Freight Forwarders Association. "The delays are running into two to three weeks." Cargo containers typically take two to three days to move out of the port.   IDLE CONTAINERS A freight forwarder who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity said holiday merchandise for retailers like JC Penney, Macy's, Kohl's and Nordstrom that landed at the Los Angeles port two weeks ago still has not cleared the port. An apparel importer who declined to be named said American Eagle, Ralph Lauren and Carter's shipments from Bangladesh have been stuck for over two weeks. "We simply don't know when these shipments will move out," the source said. An American Eagle spokeswoman declined comment on the delays. JC Penney and Macy's both said they did not anticipate significant delay-related issues. A Nordstrom spokeswoman said the company was contacting vendors for information. Wal-Mart, Kohl's, Ralph Lauren and Carter's did not respond to requests seeking comment.   DISPUTE ABOUT CAUSES Outside the gates of Los Angeles/Long Beach Seaport on busy days, trucks stand in mile-long queues, even as stacks of unmoved containers wait for pickup at a complex that handles 40 percent of <U+200B>U.S. container cargo. <U+200B><U+200B>The Port of New York and New Jersey is also affected, but to a lesser extent. Val Noronha, president of Digital Geographic Group, said the company's GPS tracking data showed a third of trucks took more than two hours to enter and leave the port, compared to about one fifth taking that long in June of 2010. Geoffrey Hanna, vice president of textile importer Henry W. Peabody &amp; Co., said some truckers have refused to go to the ports because of long wait times. It took his firm more than two weeks to get a recent shipment out, Hanna said. The disruptions stem from the move by shipping lines, which struggled during the recession, to sell container trailers and other non-core assets to equipment leasing companies, port sources and outside experts said. The change sent roughly 8,000 truckers that serve the port each day scrambling to find chassis. The backlog of containers is creating extra work. Statistics from the Pacific Maritime Association, which represents 29 ports along the West Coast, show hours paid to terminal workers jumped 24 percent this September over the same month last year. Last month, 750,850 inbound containers arrived at the Los Angeles/Long Beach complex, up almost 11 percent from a year ago, the port statistics show. Several retailers and importers are considering alternatives such as Houston or East Coast ports, Hirzel of Los Angeles Customs Brokers and Freight Forwarders Association said. "It will cost more and take longer but they want certainty," he said. "In this situation, there is value in certainty."   (Editing by David Greising and Tomasz Janowski) FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersChina's President Xi Jinping meets with the guests at the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank launch ceremony at the Great Hall of the People in BeijingSHANGHAI (Reuters) - Australia, Indonesia and South Korea skipped the launch of a China-backed Asian infrastructure bank on Friday as the United States said it had concerns about the new rival to Western-dominated multilateral lenders. China's proposed $50 billion Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) is seen as a challenge to the World Bank and Asian Development Bank, both multilateral lenders that count Washington and its allies as their biggest financial backers. China, which is keen to extend its influence in the region, has limited voting power over these existing banks despite being the world's second-largest economy. The AIIB, launched in Beijing at a ceremony attended by Chinese finance minister Lou Jiwei and delegates from 21 countries including India, Thailand and Malaysia, aims to give project loans to developing nations. China is set to be its largest shareholder with a stake of up to 50 percent. Indonesia, where President Xi Jinping first spoke of the AIIB during an October visit last year, was not present and neither were South Korea and Australia, according to a pool report. Media reports said U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry put pressure on Australia to stay out of the bank. However, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said: "Secretary Kerry has made clear directly to the Chinese as well as to other partners that we <U+200E>welcome the idea of an infrastructure bank for Asia but we strongly urge that it meet international standards of governance and transparency. "We have concerns about the ambiguous nature of the AIIB proposal as it currently stands, that we have also expressed publicly." The Australian Financial Review said on Friday that Kerry had personally asked Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott to keep Australia out of the AIIB. "Australia has been under pressure from the U.S. for some time to not become a founding member of the bank and it is understood Mr Kerry put the case directly to the prime minister when the pair met in Jakarta on Monday ­following the inauguration of Indonesian President Joko Widodo," the paper said. South Korea, one of Washington's strongest diplomatic allies in Asia, has yet to say it will formally participate in the bank. "We have continued to demand rationality in areas such as governance and safeguard issues, and there's no reason (for Korea) not to join it," South Korean Finance Minister Choi Kyung-hwan said in Beijing on Thursday.  Earlier this month, commenting on reports that was pressure from Washington to stay out of the AIIB, the South Korean finance ministry said: "South Korea has not delayed its participation but has been negotiating with China because it thinks more consideration is necessary on details of the planned bank such as the AIIB's governance and operational principles." The Seoul-based JoongAng Daily quoted a South Korean diplomatic source as saying: "While Korea has been dropped from the list of founding members of the AIIB this time around, it is still in a deep dilemma on what sort of strategic choices it has to make as China challenges the U.S.-led international order." The AIIB is expected to begin operations in 2015 with senior Chinese banker Jin Liqun, ex-chairman of investment bank China International Capital Corp, expected to take a leading role. Last month, China's finance ministry said Australia and South Korea had expressed interest in the AIIB. On Thursday, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) chief said he doesn't welcome a China-backed rival bank that will have a virtually identical aim. "I understand it, but I don't welcome it," said bank president Takehiko Nakao. "I'm not so concerned." The ADB, created in 1966, offers grants and below-market interest rates on loans to lower to middle-income countries. At the end of 2013, its financing operations amounted to $21.02 billion. China has a 6 percent stake in the ADB, and the major shareholdings are held by the United States and Japan.

REUTERS/Neil HallBritain has been told it must pay an extra €2.1bn (£1.7bn) into the European Union budget by the end of next month because the UK economy is doing better relative to other European economies. The demand is certain to be used against David Cameron by the growing camp who want the UK to quit the EU. British and European commission officials confirmed that the Treasury had been told last week that budget contribution calculations based on gross national income (GNI) adjustments carried out by Eurostat, the EU statistics agency, had exposed a huge discrepancy between what Britain had been asked to contribute and what it should be paying, because of the UK’s recovery. The bombshell, first reported by the Financial Times, was dropped into the middle of an EU summit in Brussels where Cameron and 27 other leaders were mired in tough negotiations over climate-change policy and attempts to agree big reductions in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. A Downing Street source said: “It’s not acceptable to just change the fees for previous years and demand them back at a moment’s notice. The European commission was not expecting this money and does not need this money and we will work with other countries similarly affected to do all we can to challenge this.” The prime minister on Thursday evening conferred with Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, as the Netherlands has also been ordered to pay more than €600m extra into the budget, while other countries such as Germany and France are likely to have excess contributions returned. The commission told the various countries of the revamped figures on 17 October, EU officials said. They said the British had until 1 December to provide €2.1bn, roughly a fifth of the UK’s annual net contribution to the EU. The demand for the money is political dynamite for a prime minister wrestling with dilemmas over Britain’s future in Europe and broadly seen to be making increasingly Eurosceptic gestures to the restless backbenchers who want to deal with Nigel Farage’s Europe rejectionists. “The timing is far from ideal,” said Patrizio Fiorilli, spokesman for the EU budget commissioner. “But there are rules we have to follow.” “It’s crazy,” said Richard Corbett, a Labour MEP and former senior EU official. “This must be an automatic thing because politically the timing could not be worse.” Farage, leader of Ukip, led the condemnation of the European commission plan. “Having come to Britain to set fire to David Cameron’s migration ideas, José Manuel Barroso [European commission president] has returned to Brussels to pour more fuel on the flames,” he told the Guardian. “This is the EU making clear that economic success is not to be applauded but to be punished. Mr Cameron has to veto this if he is to have any credibility at all.” Leading Tories also condemned the commission. MP Tracey Crouch, who is playing a key role in the campaign for the upcoming Rochester and Strood byelection, said: “You should not punish countries that are working hard to recover from the great recession. The EU should look at George Osborne’s long-term economic plan and learn some lessons from it.” Nick de Bois, a senior member of the Tory 1922 backbenchers’ committee, said: “Only the EU would demand more money when everyone is belt-tightening. Only the EU would want to penalise growing economies to subsidise those that have not made the tough decisions. There is only one answer to such a ludicrous demand – no.” Mark Pritchard, former secretary of the 1922 committee, said: “Penalising the UK for its economic success goes to the very heart of what is wrong with Europe. It is Europe’s waste and inefficiencies that should be targeted by Brussels – not UK taxpayers. We pay enough already. Not a single euro more should be paid.” The request for the money comes as Cameron and his party, under pressure from Ukip to bolster their anti-EU credentials, are embroiled in fights with Brussels and other EU capitals over freedom of movement and immigration within the EU, and over Cameron’s insistence on rewriting the terms of Britain’s EU membership before putting a new deal to an in-out referendum by 2017 if he wins a second term next year. Cameron has set great store on campaigning to reduce the overall EU budget, arguing that at a time of austerity and spending cuts all across Europe, the Brussels pot could not remain immune. Eurostat arrived at the €2.1bn figure on the basis of new methods of calculating member states’ GNI since 1995, taking account of previously unreported or under-reported black economy elements, such as drug dealing and consumption or the sex industry. Eurostat concluded that the UK economy has been doing much better than previously assumed since 1995, relative to other European countries, and that British contributions needed to be upped. “It changes the way contributions to the budget are calculated,” said Fiorilli. “Some member states have booming economies. Everyone can see the UK is growing much faster than others.” Fiorilli said that the commission and Eurostat use 1995 as the benchmark year for calculating the impact of GNI figures. “Member states including Britain insisted on this. It is their decision,” he said. The demand comes as part of what is known in Brussels as an amending budget proposal, a routine event that occurs regularly and is dependent on the ebb and flow of payments into the EU machine. There are currently a further six amending budgets on the table in Brussels, some of which may entail returning funds to Britain, meaning the overall bill could yet be cut. While the €2.1bn bill is theoretically due by 1 December, the amending budget also has to be endorsed by the 28 governments of the EU and by the European parliament, meaning it could run into resistance if Britain is able to marshal enough allies and given that there are many European governments reluctant to hand an easy victory to those campaigning to take the UK out of the EU.

REUTERS/Jon NazcaCarolina Gonzalez, 39, and her three and four-year-old children stand in a street with their dogs and belongings after Spanish riot police evicted them from an unoccupied building of flats in Malaga, southern Spain Oct. 3, 2013Madrid (Reuters) - Last year Madrid’s city and regional governments sold almost 5,000 rent-controlled flats to private equity investors including Goldman Sachs and Blackstone. At the time, the tenants were told their rental conditions would remain the same. But as old contracts expire, dozens of people have received demands for higher rent, been told their rents will increase dramatically, been threatened with eviction or moved out to escape the insecurity. Thousands of Spain’s poor now depend for their homes on the generosity of private equity. Jamila Bouzelmat is one of them. The mother of six lives in a four-bedroom flat on the outskirts of the Spanish capital that was bought jointly by Goldman and a Spanish firm. The 44-year-old said that until March her family paid 58 euros ($73) a month in rent out of her husband’s 500-euro unemployment benefit. In April, her bank statement shows, her new landlords suddenly took 436 euros from her bank account. She discovered the payment when she tried to pay an electricity bill. “We went to take money out and there wasn’t a cent left in the bank,” she said, her 18-month-old daughter playing at her feet. She got charity hand-outs to feed her children, aged between 18 months and 19 years, and now lives in fear of the rent bill. Goldman declined to comment. In the buildings sold to the funds, Reuters has spoken to more than 40 households who face similar difficulties. They include some of Madrid’s most vulnerable people: an unemployed single mother of five with a severely disabled daughter, for example, and an HIV patient with one lung. Both faced evictions that were temporarily halted at the last minute. There is no suggestion the buyers have acted illegally. Having bought around 15 percent of Madrid’s publicly held social housing, the new owners are simply exercising their right to charge commercial rents once reduced rents that tenants have paid expire. However, Socialist councillors in Madrid have launched lawsuits directed at the state bodies that sold the rent-controlled homes, and tenants meet weekly to organize street protests. Evictions ordered and postponed by the new owners are an increasingly common sight in Spain’s media. For the private equity firms that bought the flats, the deal was good business. For tenants, less so. The poorest had long benefited from rent reductions - some of them officially documented contracts, others informal arrangements with well-meaning public officials.The ructions in Madrid come as Spain tries to recover from its historic property-market collapse and deep economic crisis. Between 2007 and 2013, Spanish property prices fell by nearly 40 percent. More than 3 million houses and apartments sit empty, according to official figures. Spain has one of the smallest stocks of social housing in Europe, but as Madrid’s authorities cut their budgets, they have sold what they can at fire-sale prices. Of the homes Goldman bought, around 400 benefited from official rent reductions, according to one government source. Such cuts were agreed individually for up to two years, and some tenants used to pay less than 20 percent of the going rate. The informal deals are hard to count. The apartments were sold by two government agencies. One of them, the Madrid city housing body, told Reuters the sales were crucial to paying its debt, but did not answer questions on the number of tenants affected or their situation. The other, the regional housing body known as IVIMA, sold its flats to Goldman Sachs International and Azora, a Spanish private equity firm which invests in rental accommodation. Azora set up a management firm, Encasa Cibeles, to manage the flats, and both Goldman and Azora referred inquiries to Encasa Cibeles. In the case of Bouzelmat, whose rental agreement ended in March, an Encasa Cibeles spokesman declined to comment on “processes and methods of payment.” But he said Bouzelmat had been paying by direct debit. The company said it respects all ongoing contracts, including rent reductions, and once these expire, reviews each tenant case-by-case. “Evictions occur in an extremely small number of cases,” the spokesman said: “Our priority is to help those in need and we are doing this with a team of social workers looking to help the most vulnerable.” Pablo Sola, a spokesman for IVIMA, said the deal had been exemplary and IVIMA meets Encasa Cibeles every week to ensure “no family that wants to pay” is evicted. “The Madrid government has not washed its hands of the management of these flats. We are following up the process to avoid the eviction of any family in financial difficulty.” The public-sector real estate workout is creating winners and losers. Spain needs new investment to put a floor under its property market - a necessary condition for a broader recovery - and at the same time its social safety net needs funds. Economist Miguel Hernandez said foreign investors play an important role by providing cash to public institutions. “These funds may appear to be acting like vultures, but they are also helping the system, because the administrations had very few options to get the cash they needed,” said Hernandez, professor at IE Business School. The red-brick development where Bouzelmat lives is in Vallecas, a working-class area in the south of Madrid. Thousands of new flats – many of them state-owned social housing – were built there during Spain’s property boom in the early 2000s. When boom turned to bust in 2008, Spain’s budget for housing collapsed. It was 1.4 billion euros in 2008 and is now 800 million. That left local governments scrambling to cut costs, and eyeing privatizations. To lure foreign investors, Madrid overhauled rental laws, making it easier for landlords to evict non-paying tenants. It worked: Investment in Spanish real estate increased 12-fold last year to 5.2 billion euros. A confidential May 2013 report – commissioned by Madrid city council and prepared by PriceWaterhouseCoopers – found that the city’s housing unit, known as EMVS, was unsustainable. EMVS, set up over 30 years ago to house the poor and disadvantaged, had higher debt repayments than its cash income. PWC’s report advised Madrid to sell some flats immediately. In July 2013, the city sold 1,860 properties to a fund jointly owned by Blackstone and Spanish fund Magic Real Estate. The average price per apartment was around 67,200 euros. EMVS said the sales were crucial to paying down its debt. Opposition United Left councillor Angel Perez said it was an outrage. “You are playing with people’s lives,” he told an angry town hall session at the time. Blackstone declined to comment. Magic Real Estate did not respond. Within weeks of the Madrid City Council’s sale, IVIMA, the regional housing body, sold another 2,935 apartments - including Bouzelmat’s - to Goldman Sachs and Azora for roughly 68,500 euros per unit. Taking an average size of around 70 square meters for the flats sold, Goldman and Blackstone and their Spanish partners paid around 970 euros per sq m for the properties. Flats in Vallecas sell for around 2,000 euros per sq m, real estate agent websites show – about 200,000 euros for a 100-sq-km home. "The price per unit was very cheap," said Fernando Encinar of Madrid-based real estate agent Idealista. "In any market, if you buy in volume you get a good price." Thomson ReutersUnemployed hairdresser and mother-of-three Yasmin Rubiano looks at documents at her flat in Madrid Last October, Pablo Cavero, Madrid councilor for transport, infrastructure and housing, told a council session that the only change for the IVIMA tenants would be “the name at the top of the rent bill," the minutes show. He declined to be interviewed. That month, tenants in Bouzelmat’s block, some of whom had official rent reductions, received a letter from Encasa Cibeles saying: “The rental contract will not suffer any change. You will maintain the same rental conditions that you have currently, including the monthly rent and the length of your contract.” The letter, seen by Reuters, said tenants needn’t do anything. It did not mention what would happen after the contracts ended, nor did it refer to reduced rents. These were separate arrangements that each tenant made with their state landlord. For instance, if a tenant lost their job, they would submit documentation and IVIMA would grant a discretionary reduction for a fixed period, documents seen by Reuters show. Of the 20,000 homes IVIMA now owns, around 27 percent have a formal rent reduction of between 5 percent and 95 percent, a source close to IVIMA said. Late last year, Encasa Cibeles invited four tenants’ representatives from Bouzelmat’s block to a meeting. The company told them rent reductions would not be renewed once contracts expired. “Encasa Cibeles told us they would respect reductions until the contract ended but then it would return to the base rate, because they were not a charity,” said Saida Juarez, the tenant representative from the block.

Rubiano said she stopped getting a printed rent bill once her reduced rent of 50 euros per month ended in December, but got no word from the new owners. In January she started to receive monthly text messages from her bank, which she showed a reporter, advising that it had received a demand for 498.18 euros. She has been paying 100 euros a month to show goodwill, but cannot pay more. In March, Rubiano said, she received a letter from Encasa Cibeles demanding full payment or threatening legal action. The Encasa Cibeles spokesman said it had nothing to do with the text messages. Social workers have been working for some time to find the best solution for the family, who still live in the flat, he added. “Encasa Cibeles has not started any legal action against them.” The situation with Blackstone and Magic Real Estate is slightly different. Their tenants generally have longer contracts and fewer formal deals for reduced rents, though most pay below market rates. As with the Goldman flats, tenants were told nothing would change: “The contracts ... are guaranteed,” seller EMVS said in a July news release. “The only thing that will change in the rent statement is the issuer.” As leases near expiry, at least 20 tenants in one block have signed new contracts for sharp rent rises, said a source with knowledge of the matter. When Blackstone and Magic Real Estate bought the flats, Jaime Gamarra, an unemployed 62-year-old receiving benefits of less than 400 euros a month, had not been paying full rent for around a year. After he lost both his jobs, a woman at the council had told him to pay what he could afford. On March 12, he got a letter from the new management company, Fidere, saying he owed them 5,133.54 euros in “inherent obligations” to be paid by March 5. “I started to panic,” he said. He met Fidere and was told his arrangement with the council was not viable for the firm. On June 24 he got a letter of eviction. A judge overruled this in September, but Fidere can appeal. Gamarra fears he will be thrown out. “These flats were built with public money for people in difficulty,” Gamarra said. Jorge Arriba, a 37-year-old car mechanic, lives in a Blackstone flat; his 10-year contract ended in August. He used to pay 415 euros per month in rent, around a third of his salary. When he met Fidere in May, he said, they told him the rent would go up from September. On Aug. 6, the 20 tenants in Arriba’s block signed new contracts with Fidere, some of them seen by Reuters, which stipulate a rise of more than 40 percent in rent over three years. Blackstone referred inquiries to Fidere. “It is not true that it is our intention to increase rent once the contracts end,” Fidere spokesman Miguel Onate said in an email. Later, he said “some people have lost the public subsidy they received from the council.” Of the flats under Fidere’s management, he said, fewer than 2 percent have recurring problems with payments. Six sources involved in the bidding process told Reuters that bidders knew the straitened circumstances of the tenants. The funds that entered final bidding – nine in all – were given detailed information. The sale terms, seen by Reuters, show the regional government stressed that the new owners must honor all the tenants’ rights and obligations. Goldman went for the Madrid homes after a successful pair of similar deals in Germany, a person familiar with the matter said. Goldman looked at the profiles of the tenants and considered whether the properties were “under-managed from a yield perspective” and whether new ownership could “improve rents.” The deal was particularly appealing because 85 percent of the flats were occupied and most tenants were paying rent, in contrast to other properties with high percentages of defaulted mortgages or laws that made it hard to raise rents. Some local politicians say IVIMA acted illegally by selling the flats cheap. IVIMA Director Ana Gomendio declined to comment. Now a judge will decide who, if anyone, to blame. Any tenants evicted can reapply for social housing. Around 13,000 households are already on the waiting list for flats owned by Madrid city council, a source close to the council said.
