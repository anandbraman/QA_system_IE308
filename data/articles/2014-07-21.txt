Standard CharteredChina's total debt (financial credit) burden hit 251% of GDP at the end of June, according to Stephen Green at Standard Chartered. By comparison, the US had a 260% total-debt-to-GDP ratio in 2013 and Japan has 415%, according to the FT. On the face of it this doesn't look as bad. And the argument typically goes that because a lot of this is domestic, not external debt, China has no reason to worry. But the concern with China has centered on the rapid rise in debt (financial credit) to GDP from 2009 on. This financial credit or debt number cited by Green looks at "total social financing (TSF) numbers published by the People's Bank of China,  offshore cross-border bank borrowing and bond issuance, as well as official Ministry of Finance (MoF) debt." And if you recall China's back on a credit binge. TSF surged to 1.98 trillion yuan in June, from 1.40 trillion yuan in May, and beat expectations for 1.42 trillion yuan. That prompted Bloomberg economist Tom Orlik to tweet that growth has become Beijing's top priority again. Last year economists said the main bear argument on China was that it took more and more credit growth to deliver less and less economic growth. Green points to a chart showing the divergence in total credit and nominal GDP. "Clearly, though, until the green and blue lines converge, the economy will continue to leverage up, and the market will remain concerned." Standard Chartered FREE AppDownload
Citigroup currency strategist Steven Englander notes that the market is in a fragile position, and that there are two events coming up that could derail things: The two big risk events are the US CPI and next week’s FOMC. We already saw equities come off a little today, short and medium term note yields move up, and 10yr Treasury yields fall in line with equities. We suspect that investors will hedge a small part of long risk positions in coming days, but only languidly. They have begun to discount non-press conference meetings as being like the ECB’s non-forecast meetings, unlikely to generate much waves. The first one of the two risk events is Tuesday at 8:30 a.m., when we get CPI. One of the big questions in the economy right now is whether inflation is picking up, because if it is, then that might push the Fed to tighten rates sooner than is currently expected. Generally, inflation hasn't been a thing in several years, but in recent months, core CPI has picked up notably. If that continues, then pressure on the Fed to hike rates will rise significantly.

Russia’s wealthiest have lost billions of dollars since the beginning of the year, as Western sanctions against the country over its involvement in Ukraine continue tightening their grip over the weak economy. Russia’s 19 billionaires have lost $14.5 billion since January, data from the Bloomberg Billionaires Index shows. America’s 64 billionaires have gained $56.5 billion over the same time period. Alisher Usmanov, Russia’s richest man who amassed his fortune through steel and iron ore mining, has lost $2.5 billion so far this year, dragging his net worth down nearly 13 percent to $17.7 billion. Russian steel tycoon Vladimir Lisin has lost $2.4 billion, nearly 17 percent of his net worth, and businessman Andrey Melnichenko has lost $2.1 billion, about 14 percent of the value of his assets. The highest gain of any Russian billionaire is $1 billion. Bill Gates, the former chief executive of Microsoft Corp., has already upped his net worth by $6 billion this year, though other Americans have lost billions. Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon.com has lost $3.4 billion so far this year. Russian billionaires speaking anonymously told Bloomberg that their country’s most elite circle of businessmen are increasingly frantic that President Vladimir Putin’s policies in Ukraine will lead to more crippling sanctions.

China will have all the power here.” Russian stocks fell 1.4 percent on Monday, continuing the past week’s 5 percent slide to one-month lows and a 12 percent drop since January. FREE AppDownload
Extell Development CompanyExtell's plan for its Riverside South project.The New York Post reported yesterday that New York City has approved developer Extell’s plans to build a separate entrance for its affordable-housing tenants at an Upper West Side condo. Dubbed the “poor door,” the controversial approval was a blow to New Yorkers who believe the separate entrance to be classist and distasteful. The 33-story luxury condo on 40 Riverside Drive will have 55 low-income units and 219 market-rate condominiums facing the Hudson River, according to The Post. The low-income units will be located on floors two through six with a studio going for $845 a month, a one-bedroom for $908, and two-bedrooms for $1,099. Market-rate buyers, on the other hand, would be paying more than $1,000 per square foot. The building will be part of Extell's planned Riverside South dev elopement, which will stretch from 72nd to 59th Streets. The building is a part of New York City's "inclusionary zoning" strategy for providing affordable housing to low-income families, itself a controversial program that gives developers more floor area and large tax breaks in exchange for building on- or off-site affordable housing. WNYW/ScreenshotA mock up of Extell's 40 Riverside Drive entrance.The “poor door” is not the only one of its kind in the city. A few other large development projects also have separate entrances for renters and owners, and it’s not uncommon for mixed-income buildings to provide amenities for the building’s market-rate owners that they don’t provide for middle-income or low-income residents. And not everyone agrees that the “poor door” is the main problem. Josh Barro, Business Insider’s former politics editor, made the argument last year that if New York City fully taxed these market rate apartments instead of giving developers tax breaks for building affordable housing on-site (it’s estimated the property tax abatements have lost NYC $2.9 billion in revenue), they could use that money to spend on building more affordable housing.

REUTERS/Victor Ruiz GarciaFA Insights is a daily newsletter from Business Insider that delivers the top news and commentary for financial advisors. BlackRock: 'Investors Should Buckle Up For More Volatility Ahead' (BlackRock Blog) "…The tragic downing of a Malaysian civilian airliner over Ukraine and worsening conflict in the Middle East sparked a market rout on Thursday that brought an unusually quiet period for financial markets to an end," Russ Koesterich at BlackRock writes in a new piece. Now he thinks "investors should buckle up for more volatility ahead." Koesterich points out that stock market volatility is still 25% below its long-term average. "Low volatility suggests markets are complacent and not taking into account the prospect of bad news. Indeed, there is no shortage of potential triggers for more turbulence ahead." The possible triggers for more volatility include rising geopolitical tensions in Ukraine, ground war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, tensions in Iraq, and an early rate hike from the U.S. Federal Reserve. How Advisors Can Make The Best Use Of Twitter (The Wall Street Journal)  It's becoming more apparent that advisors need to use social-media platforms like Twitter. But to truly exploit these platforms, advisors need to realize that "clients are more interested in human-interest stories," writes Catherine Valega, owner of Green Bridge Wealth Management, in a WSJ column. "Tweets about financial markets will only get retweeted by industry cohorts," she writes. Instead she thinks advisors should use Twitter to give existing and potential clients a sense of who they are through tweets about personal experiences or those of clients. $200 Million Advisor Pair Leave Wells Fargo For Raymond James (Financial Planning)  Christopher Fluehr and Jason Mamalis have left Wells Fargo, where they managed over $200 million in client assets and had over $1 million in production, for Raymond James, reports Maddy Perkins at Financial Planning.

Raymond James also reeled in a UBS advisor team managing over $575 million in assets on July 10," reports Perkins.  GRANTHAM: Here Are 5 Lessons I Learned From 2 Failed Investments (Business Insider) In his latest GMO quarterly letter, Jeremy Grantham highlighted the five key lessons he learned as a novice investor. These lessons emerged from two early failed investments, first, was American Raceways, a company looking to bring Formula 1 Grand Prix to the U.S.. Next was Market Monitor Data Systems which was "going to put a "Monitor," an electronic screen, on every broker’s desk, so that they could trade in options, making their own market," but ultimately ended up being "way ahead of its time." Here they are verbatim: 1. You can't know how people who are important to you will behave under pressure. And if you have to pick one who will outperform, pick your wife.2. Local cultural differences can be very enduring even between Britain and the U.S. Formula 1 is trying again in the U.S. as I write, 46 years later. Soccer here has also been just around the corner for 50 years.3. Sometimes even a great idea will fail, like Market Monitor, because the technology infrastructure is just not there; that it is simply ahead of its time.4. Much more importantly, investing is serious. It can and often is intellectually compelling. But it should not be driven by excitement, as it is for many individuals, and when treated that way will almost always end badly. My experience with American Raceways and Market Monitor and, more important, my experience at painfully wiping out myself and my wife financially did far more than teach or reteach some of the basic rules of investing. It turned me profoundly away from the speculative and gambling possibilities of investing and turned me permanently, and pretty much overnight, into a patient, long-term value investor. Luckily, the new lifestyle fitted nicely with my nature conservative and frugal upbringing. The value perspective is pretty much baked into the Yorkshire culture. Happily, it also seems to work most of the time. Rolling the dice, however, was appropriate, it seems, when applied to the question of whether or not to start a new investment firm, for the period 1970 to about 1990 was particularly favorable to the start-up of new, small firms. For a while then, institutional investors actually seemed to prefer start-ups to the giant banks, which dominated the business but that had done so badly in the 1974 decline. And my willingness to take the risk of a start-up had been strongly influenced by the very brief existence of my substantial nest egg. So, once again...5. It is better to be lucky than good, but of course appropriate to aspire to both.

Thomson ReutersThe Economy Ministry building is seen in Buenos AiresNEW YORK (Reuters) - Argentina asked a U.S. judge on Monday to put on hold an order requiring it to pay bondholders who did not participate in debt restructurings following the country's 2002 default, while it seeks a "global resolution." Ahead of a July 30 deadline to reach a deal or face a new default, Argentina filed papers asking a New York federal judge to stay a ruling that it pay the holdout investors $1.33 billion plus interest. Argentina, which has been in settlement talks, said any deal must take into account other bondholders and factor in a clause in its restructured bonds that could open it up to further liability. "As those risks remain, so does the necessity and appropriateness of a stay," Argentina's lawyers wrote. The request is not the first time Argentina has asked for a stay, which U.S. District Judge Thomas Griesa has previously denied. On Tuesday, Griesa is expected to hear a range of requests by Argentina, bondholders and financial institutions over how to enforce his ruling requiring payment to the holdouts. The payment to the holdouts, led by Elliott Management's NML Capital Ltd and Aurelius Capital Management, was due at the time of Argentina's next payment to the 92 percent of its creditors who participated in debt swaps in 2005 and 2010 following the country's $100 billion default. Argentina last month attempted to make a $539 million payment to the restructured bondholders due June 30. But Griesa deemed it a violation of his order and told Bank of New York Mellon Corp to return the money. A 30-day grace period is now in effect before a default can be declared. In Monday's court filing, Argentina renewed arguments that the holdouts should not be allowed to put at risk its prior restructurings. The country's lawyers said any deal needed to resolve not just claims by the plaintiffs but also those of other holdout creditors. Holdout creditor claims total as much as $20 billion globally, Argentina said. Argentina argued any resolution must also be consistent with a clause in the restructured bonds' contracts that would open it up to billions of dollars in additional claims if triggered before it expires at the end of this year. Argentina said it continues to participate in settlement talks before a court-appointed mediator, Daniel Pollack. "But that process must take into account these legal and factual constraints," Argentina's lawyers wrote. NML did not respond to requests for comment and Aurelius had no immediate comment Monday.   (Reporting by Nate Raymond in New York; Editing by Lisa Shumaker) FREE AppDownload
Melia Robinson/Business InsiderMartin Greenfield Clothiers is the last unionized men's clothing factory in New York City with more than 100 employees.A menswear factory in Brooklyn has been "doing things the old-fashioned way" for more than 60 years. Martin Greenfield Clothiers produces handmade men's suits, an impressive feat considering less than 3% of clothes sold in the U.S. is American-made. Most U.S. apparel companies outsource their labor to places where clothing is faster and cheaper to make. But Martin Greenfield isn't in the menswear business for the money alone. Greenfield arrived at Brooklyn manufacturer GGG Clothes in 1947 from Czechoslovakia; it was his first job in the States. He carried unfinished garments from one station to the next. A poster boy for the American Dream, Greenfield worked his way up from blind stitcher to supervisor to vice president, and eventually bought the factory, renaming it in 1977. Today, he continues the tradition of making suits by hand at his four-floor warehouse in East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, where his client list includes Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, Michael Bloomberg, and Leonardo DiCaprio. "I see my suits being worn all over the world," Greenfield says. "I love to see the results." 
There are many facets to discussing and understanding the potential role in the world of digital money such as Bitcoin. A great deal of the discussion focuses on what I would describe as “policy issues” – e.g. what market and policy mechanisms are needed to ensure price stability, combat financial crime, ensure tax compliance, and provide adequate protections to consumers holding these assets. While important, these issues are distinct from a more imperative discussion around the essential characteristics of the underlying asset itself.  One of the most common statements made about Bitcoin is that it holds no intrinsic value. Gold, under popular perception, holds immense intrinsic value. Fiat money holds value because it is backed by the credit of the governments who issue it. But neither of these currency formats makes much sense in our modern world of international trade and commerce. So what form of “good money” should we support as we build a 21st century, globally integrated, Internet-based world economy? I want to focus on the argument that Bitcoin lacks physical traits that make it “good money,” unlike gold or other precious items such as diamonds, or the reputation and credit-worthiness of governments and their associated proprietary payments rails. Indeed, I believe that Bitcoin holds value as a form of “good money” that is superior to any previously discovered or developed form of money. Gold became money when users discovered it holds characteristics that made it a strong form of currency. Gold is divisible, and given its unique chemical composition, extremely difficult to counterfeit. As a physical commodity buried in the earth, gold is scarce, which also makes it attractive to its users. Finally, and critically, gold is a physical asset that can change hands, a bearer instrument. This idea that value can be transferred by simply giving a physical object to another person is fundamental in the history of human perception of value. It also explains why 85 percent of the world’s retail transactions are still performed using physical currency. For centuries, these core traits drove gold to dominate world trade. Through the Industrial Revolution, during the growth of global commercial banking, and after World War II, the gold-backed dollar became the foundation of the world economy. It wasn’t until the 1960s that a recovering Germany and a war-immersed, massively indebted US government broke with the gold standard and decided that a politically independent form of money no longer mattered. However, Nixon’s abandonment of the gold standard in 1971 and the birth of fiat money are not the end of the history of currency. Bitcoin may herald the dawning of a new age in currency. It holds superior traits as a form of “good money.” As a tangible form of asset (its core tangibility being its mathematical basis), it could become an incredibly important building block for the 21st century’s global economy. At the foundation of Bitcoin’s intrinsic value is the proof-of-work system that regulates the discovery and distribution of bitcoins and is anchored in the aggregate computing energy required to secure the Bitcoin network. This self-regulating mechanism defines the core economic value of the units of account, independent of their trade or exchange value. Further, this energy and computing power bound paradigm creates a dynamic such that, as economic activity in Bitcoin expands, it naturally drives humanity to find sources of energy efficiency, thereby aligning Bitcoin with our global need for sustainable, inexpensive energy sources.  Bitcoin’s near infinite divisibility and computational verifiability make it a highly attractive global unit of account.  Value can be expressed and exchanged in micro-cents, and the ownership of these units of account can be instantly and independently verified by any transaction counter-party.   Bitcoin offers ubiquitous distribution and reach. Unlike existing forms of money, Bitcoin has the reach of data and the Internet, a medium of exchange (software, the Internet, mobile devices) now reaching nearly 3 billion humans. Bitcoin can be programmed, metered, and exchanged by connected devices, enabling more efficient usage of our planet’s resources and services. By design, Bitcoin is a scarce resource with a predictable supply of new issuance. And it is this scarcity and predictable supply that make it so attractive as an underlying asset to bind to economic activity and trade. Bitcoin is also politically independent. It belongs to the commons, a technology based on open intellectual property and the Internet. As we work towards building a more globally integrated society and economy, it seems increasingly critical that the form of money that binds us not be tied to any single nation-state. Naturally, policy makers and central bankers should be asking questions and trying to understand the implications of this profound invention. Importantly, like the centuries of global trade that were supported and mediated by a nation-state independent gold-backed monetary policy, we now need to begin to think about a world of digital asset backed monetary policy and how to integrate and support innovations like Bitcoin into the mainstream of world trade.

It's the rise of the machines. Robo-advisors, which have made headlines in recent years, are online investment management sites like Wealthfront and Betterment that manage your investments for you through unique algorithms. The nickname "robo-advisor" might be more sensationalist than it is accurate. "I think this whole robo-advisor terminology is a misnomer," says Phil Fragasso, who evaluates the effectiveness of financial advisors through his company Audit Your Financial Advisors. "They're not advisors. They're really more like a fund of funds, like a mutual fund company." Semantics aside, they're now a viable option for investors looking to grow their wealth. Below, we pit humans (whom we'll refer to as investment advisors) and robots head to head to see who wins when it comes to managing your investments. This is where robo-advisors shine. There's no need to get into the weeds here, because both Wealthfront and Betterment devote considerable real estate to explaining their fairly straightforward and transparent pricing structures on their websites. Wealthfront requires a minimum investment of $5,000; Betterment does not have a minimum. Investment advisors, on the other hand, sometimes require a minimum portfolio value, and they can be unclear about how exactly they're charging you. Those are both case by case, but when it comes down to the numbers, Wealthfront points out that investment advisors traditionally charge a 1.31% average fee, while the robotic alternative charges 0.25% in advisory fees after the first $10,000. Betterment charges a 0.15%-0.35% management fee. (Both companies also charge fees for the ETFs — about 0.15% per year.) SigFig, another player in the field, charges a flat $10 a month. Winner: Robots. Between email, Skype, and the trusty old cell phone, it's not like you have to trek to your investment advisor's office on the regular. In fact, working with an investment advisor doesn't even require that most people keep him or her on speed dial — it's more that they're there to check in with at regular intervals. But once again, robo-advisors win the round. While he doesn't recommend robo-advisors, Fragasso admits that they're a viable choice for people who simply aren't going to take the time to learn about managing their money. It's a good fit, he says, "if you have a personality where you just don't want to deal with it — the type of person who starts a job at 24, set a 401(k) allocation, and never changes it. You set it and forget it." Winner: Robots. Money is never just money. It's your kid's college fund, your European vacation, your quiet house on a cul-de-sac. For that reason, setting and forgetting your investments may not be the most effective way to achieve your goals. An investment advisor's strength lies in their ability to translate your dreams of an oceanfront beach house into a dollar figure, and to create a plan to get there. A robo-advisor takes only the information you give it and formulates a plan based on numbers — and your financial future is rarely focused on just the numbers. Plus, which is better able to motivate you to focus on your goals: an email statement, or a phone call from your advisor? Winner: Humans. Now, things are getting thorny. Because they're meant to suit a wide range of people, portfolios managed by robo-advisors tend to be heavily invested in conservative products like ETFs. While not particularly volatile, ETFs aren't known for their staggering returns. It's like every skydiver ever posted on his Instagram: No risk, no reward. Lance Roberts of "StreetTalkLive" wrote this year that the investments made by robo-advisors are sound, but based on a longer time frame than most investors actually experience. His analysis is worth reading. The simple fact is that money invested conservatively will yield higher returns than money not invested at all — so if it comes down to using a robo-advisor or not investing at all, robo is usually the wiser choice. Investment advisors, on the other hand, certainly aren't guaranteed to outperform their robotic friends, but they have the perspective and context to adjust investments to your needs. An advisor's perspective is particularly useful if you have a large portfolio or a complicated financial situation. If you're investing over $100,000, Fragasso cautions, you shouldn't be doing it with a robo-advisor. Winner: Humans. Use a robo-advisor if you … - Want to set and forget your investments- Feel more comfortable working online than with a person- Aren't investing a large amount of money Use an investment advisor if you … - Want to be involved in your investments- Are interested in strategic risk-taking- Are investing a large amount of money Remember that you don't have to use one to the exclusion of the other. First of all, humans and robots usually don't directly compete for the same clients (there's that minimum investment requirement, again). And as your investment needs change, so might your strategy — as well as the help you enlist.  Plus, no one is stopping you from managing your portfolio yourself. Even Wealthfront says right off the bat, "You are welcome to copy anything we do if you would rather do it yourself." A previous version of this article misstated that Wealthfront does not have a minimum investment. FREE AppDownload

REUTERS/Jonathan ErnstNews Corporation Chairman and CEO Rupert Murdoch (L) talks to Time Warner Chairman and CEO Jeffrey Bewkes.Time Warner's board just changed the company's bylaws to prevent a small group of shareholders from forcing a vote on Fox's offer for the company. The new amendment, which is effective immediately, removed a standard provision that allows 15% of a company's shareholders to vote to call a "special meeting," in this case one that could have been devoted to evaluating the Fox offer. As a result, Time Warner's shareholders have no ability to force a vote on the deal until the company's annual meeting next summer. Prior to the amendment, 15% of Time Warner's shareholders could have forced a meeting as soon as February. The removal of this provision removes the final stick that Murdoch could have used to force a relatively quick consideration of his offer. In so doing, it buys Time Warner more time. According to a source close to the company, Time Warner expects this change to help it extract more value from Fox if Murdoch decides to persist in his pursuit of the company.  Specifically, according to the source, the bylaw change provides: * More leverage for the Time Warner board to get a higher price * More time for shareholders on both sides to consider the offer (Time Warner is likely going to release more details about its future plan in the next couple of months. The company expects that shareholders will be favorably impressed by this plan.) * More time for Time Warner's operating performance to add value to the company, and, interestingly, * More time for Fox to disappoint investors and thus reduce the value of its stock. (Fox has a history of overpromising and underdelivering, the Time Warner source says, expanding the old adage to all's fair in love, war, and M&amp;A. Time Warner believes that the performance Fox has promised Wall Street is aggressive and that the company might soon stumble and miss its targets. If that happens, the stock will drop, and Fox's currency won't be as valuable, making it harder to get a deal done.) In other words, Time Warner's board continues to put actions behind words that it doesn't want to sell the company right now. And in changing its bylaws, it has removed the one immediate "forcing mechanism" that Murdoch might have had at his disposal—the ability to get a small group of Time Warner shareholders to call a meeting and force a vote. Thus, to get a deal done, Murdoch will have to raise his offer to a level that is appealing to more than a small group of short-term Time Warner shareholders. (Although this sounds like a shareholder-unfriendly move by Time Warner, it is likely designed to prevent a group of short-term arbitrageurs from controlling the company's destiny. These traders are now likely accumulating the stock in anticipation of a windfall when the deal goes through. In so doing, they are gaining power relative to longer-term Time Warner investors who own the stock because of the company's long-term business opportunity. If enough of these short-term traders buy the stock, they can effectively become the tail that wags the dog. And it is their power that Time Warner is likely seeking to neutralize.)

Chipotle InstagramChipotle is thriving. Shares are soaring after the company reported earnings that exceeded estimates. The company's strategy has helped it overtake competitors, Brian Sozzi at Belus Capital Advisors wrote in a note to clients earlier last year. Chipotle is even eroding McDonald's market share despite being a much younger company.  Sozzi shares a few reasons why Chipotle is dominating. 1. Sticking to a classic menu. While McDonald's and Taco Bell tack on new menu items to entice customers, Chipotle has stuck to the same menu since it opened. The menu at McDonald's has grown 70% since 2007, Bloomberg reported last year. Chipotle does a few things really well, making it easier to execute and reduce customer wait times. 2. Making lines faster. Chipotle has aggressively worked to reduce wait times during peak periods. Meanwhile, McDonald's is struggling with the longest drive-thru wait times in decades. Competitor Panera Bread has also dealt with a customer-service issues, and has replaced some workers with kiosks. Overloaded menus make it difficult for operations to run smoothly, Sozzi says. 3. Emphasizing an ethical menu. Chipotle is eliminating GMOs from its menu and has long boasted about its antibiotic-free meats. As a result, "people feel better about eating at Chipotle and share with others, personally or on social media, that positive experience," Sozzi writes.  FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersLogos are seen on Coca-Cola bottlesNEW YORK (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co may have annual profits of about $9.3 billion, but that princely sum could fall short of what the world's largest soda maker needs to tempt would-be franchisees into taking over more of its regional bottling operations. That is one of the biggest puzzles the Atlanta-based soft drink company is struggling to solve as it prepares to report second-quarter earnings on Tuesday. North American profit margins will likely show an improvement from the roughly 14.5 percent in the year-ago period, but may still fall short of what is needed to lure more independent bottlers to bid for Coke's North American bottling operations. Following a similar move by rival PepsiCo Inc, which reports earnings on Wednesday, Coke bought back its top bottler in the region in 2010 to streamline decision-making and cut costs. Now Coke has changed direction again and is seeking to sell the bottling operations to franchisees in a bid to shift away from the capital intensive and low-margin business of distribution to focus on what it is best at: branding and innovation. Some progress has already been made on that front. According to the trade publication Beverage Digest, Coke directly controlled 78.7 percent of U.S. distribution at the end of last year. Today that number is lower: In February, Coke announced deals to sell bottling operations in the greater Chicago and central Florida areas. Irial Finan, Coke's head of bottling investments, said at a conference in June that the company was being "methodical" in its approach, adding that the company would go faster if it could but wanted to get it right. But analysts say it could be difficult for Coke to hand over distribution to independent bottlers on a wider scale unless its North American profits grew enough to give bottling partners a large enough share to cover their cost of capital. "Right now the profit pool is too low for it to be split up in a sustainable way," said Stephen Powers, a beverage analyst at UBS. That is partly because U.S. consumers are buying less soda as they become more health conscious, a trend that has pressured carbonated soft-drink sales for years. The concern may help explain why Coke shares have edged up just 2.6 percent this year, underperforming the Standard &amp; Poor's 500, which is up 6.8 percent over the same period. Powers said he expects North American profit margins to improve in the second quarter from a year ago after a first quarter decline, with the help of the Easter holiday, which fell in the second quarter this year. Margins are stronger outside North America where Coke does most of its business. But the region still accounts for about 45 percent of Coke's cost base, he said. Investors will also be looking for commentary on pricing during Coke's conference call. The company said last quarter that the overall prices that it charges to customers increased 2 percent globally. That bodes well for both Coke and PepsiCo, which usually move in tandem. When it comes to soft drinks, "both have to be more concerned about growing the category than beating each other up," said Ali Dibadj, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. "They should play nice." As of Friday afternoon, analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters were expecting Coke to earn 63 cents a share on $12.8 billion in revenue. Analysts expect Pepsi to earn $1.23 per share on revenue of $16.8 billion.     (Reporting by Anjali Athavaley) FREE AppDownload
Chipotle InstagramChipotle reported second-quarter earnings of $3.50 per share, beating expectations of $3.09 per share.  Revenue of $1.05 billion beat expectations for $989.7 million. It was a solid quarter overall for Chipotle, with comp-store sales up 17.3%, beating expectations for a 10.5% rise. Higher food costs played into revenue. "Food costs were 34.6% of revenue, an increase of 150 basis points, driven by increased prices for beef, avocados, and dairy, partially offset by the menu price increase and lower tomatillo prices," according to the press release. "As more of Chipotle's markets are touched with menu price increases this quarter, the company is teed up for at least another two quarter[s] of strong earnings growth that could materially surpass consensus (the amount of unknown as consensus estimates will climb following this report)," Brian Sozzi, the CEO of Belus Capital Advisors, said in an email.

REUTERS/Giampiero Sposito People sunbathe as the Costa Concordia cruise liner is seen during its refloating operation at Giglio harbour July 21, 2014.Stocks on Wall Street were lower, but finished well off their worst levels as the market recovered nearly all of its early session losses to close slightly lower to start the week. First, the scoreboard: And now, the top stories of the day: 1) The economic calendar was light, with just the Chicago Fed's National Activity Index coming out this morning. The report showed that economic growth decelerated slightly in June, with the index coming in at +0.12, down from +0.16 in May. The report said, "Two of the four broad categories of indicators that make up the index made nonpositive contributions to the index in June, but two of the four categories increased from May."  2) The biggest stock story of the day was activist investor Bill Ackman's announcement that his presentation on Herbalife set for tomorrow will be, "the most important presentation" of his career. Ackman is famously short Herbalife, which saw shares fall 11% during today's trading session. And following Ackman's announcement, CNBC personality Jim Cramer said that Ackman is going to "wipe out" Herbalife because "that's his job. When it is your job, that's what you do." This announcement also comes in the wake of Herbalife superimposing Ackman's image on a "Wolf of Wall Street" movie poster calling him the, "Worst of Wall Street." Ackman's presentation starts at 10 am ET, tomorrow.  3) On the earnings front, Halliburton shares closed roughly unchanged after the oilfield services company reported a 20% rise in quarterly profit. Hasbro shares were down more than 2.5% after the company reported quarterly revenue that missed analysts' expectations.  4) Allergan, the Botox-maker that Bill Ackman is seeking to take over in conjunction with Valeant Pharmaceuticals, reported second quarter earnings and revenue that beat expectations, while also announcing it would cut 13% of its workforce. Allergan also said it would execute a restructuring plan to save the company approximately $475 million 2015 as it tries to fend off Ackman and Valeant's takeover efforts.  5) Apple is set to report quarterly earnings after the bell tomorrow, and BI's Jay Yarow highlighted how Wall Street has seemingly fallen back in love with the iPhone maker over the last quarter. Since its Q1 report, Apple shares are up about 26%, and Wall Street is expecting a huge autumn for the company with the company expected to release two new iPhones and an iWatch wearable product.  6) The Federal Reserve is in a black out period ahead of its July FOMC meeting next week, and Neil Dutta at Renaissance Macro published a note today that outlined just how close the Fed is to its goals. Dutta highlighted how, at the current median projection for payroll gains going forward, the unemployment rate could be closer to 5.7% at the end of this year, though the Fed currently expects the unemployment rate to be 6% to 6.1%. Dutta says this poses the risk that interest rate hikes could come earlier than markets are currently expecting.  Don't Miss: What Is Fracking?

flickr via pixonomyNapeague Harbor is a popular Hamptons location for kiteboarders.Goldman Sachs Managing Director Nicholas Valtz was found dead at 2 p.m. on Sunday off the coast in Long Island, The Southampton Press reported. After Valtz went kiteboarding and failed to return, Valtz' family went looking for him and found his body in Napeague Harbor. Valtz, 39, worked in cross-asset sales and was promoted to managing director in 2010, according to Bloomberg. He joined Goldman Sachs in 2000. His wife Sashi Valtz is also a Goldman Sachs employee. Napeague Harbor is a popular kite surfing location for both beginners and more advanced surfers. Bloomberg cited a police statement, saying that Valtz was still secured to his kite when he was found. Additional kitesurfing gear was found in a grassy area nearby. "We're deeply saddened by this tragedy and our thoughts are with Nick's family," Goldman Sachs spokesperson Michael DuVally told Bloomberg in an emailed statement. East Hampton police are still investigating Valtz' death. FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz William Ackman, founder and CEO of hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management, speaks at the Sohn Investment Conference in New York, May 5, 2014. Activist investor Ackman said on Monday that he recommends the shares of mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac because the companies have low liquidity risk. Herbalife shares were down as much as 11% Monday as Pershing Square founder Bill Ackman told CNBC he's delivering a presentation tomorrow that will show the nutritional supplement provider is a massive fraud. Appearing on "Halftime Report" with Scott Wapner, Ackman said the presentation would be the most important of his career. He says he has enough evidence to show that Herbalife will eventually collapse.  Ackman already published a 300-page report in December of 2012 he says proved the Grand Cayman-based firm is a pyramid scheme. The stock has climbed about 33% since then, in large part because soon afterward Carl Icahn took a massive long position in the company. Ackman will deliver his remarks at 10 a.m. tomorrow.

REUTERS/Jessica Rinaldi The Man. Fox is not likely to raise its bid for Time Warner immediately, a source familiar with the situation tells Business Insider. Rather, the increase, if any, will likely come within "weeks." The deal process is playing out the way Fox expected, our source suggests. The company's $85 per share offer got the attention of Time Warner shareholders. Fox is now listening to those shareholders and considering whether and how to modify its bid.  The Time Warner shareholders we have talked to are clear on their desires and expect the deal to happen. Their key concerns remain: 1) price (Fox has to raise its bid, probably to close to $100 per share), 2) cash/stock mix (the cash component of the bid has to be increased), and 3) voting rights (some Time Warner shareholders would like some say in the combined company). A Time Warner shareholder we spoke with today laid out a case that Time Warner's stock will be worth about $135 in five years. Discounting that future value, the shareholder arrives at a present-value range of about $92-$105 for the stock. The shareholder suggested that an offer of $100 would be enough. (By this logic, $97 would also presumably be enough.) This assessment is similar to one another Time Warner shareholder laid out for us last week. In another deal development, yesterday, Bloomberg reported that Fox is close to selling two of its European pay-TV assets and may use the cash from this sale to increase its Time Warner bid. The assets, Sky Italia and a stake in Sky Deutschland, could be valued at $13.5 billion, Bloomberg reported. A source familiar with the situation confirms Fox's possible asset sales but says the reported $13.5 billion number is much too high. Furthermore, the source says, the transaction would trigger some tax liabilities for Fox. Thus, the net cash that Fox would have available from the asset sales to increase its Time Warner bid would only be about $6-$7 billion. Time Warner has about 900 million shares outstanding, so each $1 billion increase in the offer amounts to an increase of about $1 per share. If Fox were to use the whole $6-$7 billion of cash from the asset sales to increase its Time Warner bid, therefore, it could increase the cash component to about $41 per share, up from $32.42 in the current bid. The total value of the bid, given Fox's current share price, would be about $90 per Time Warner share. Fox also has additional borrowing capacity that would allow it to borrow more cash without jeopardizing its bond ratings or likely trigger a re-valuation of its stock price. This borrowing capacity could allow it to further increase the cash portion of its bid. SEE ALSO: Here's What Insiders Are Saying Will Happen With The Fox-Time Warner Deal FREE AppDownload
Earnings season is under way, and one theme is clear: fat profit margins are driving earnings growth. "[T]he majority of earnings growth we have observed so far this quarter has been a function of margins, as companies continue to operate with as few expenses as possible," write analysts at JP Morgan Asset management. Ever since the financial crisis, sales growth has been weak.  However, corporations have been able to deliver robust earnings growth by fattening profit margins. Much of this has been done by laying off workers and squeezing more productivity out of those on the payroll. "With earnings growth (5.5%) rising at a faster rate than revenue growth (3.0%) in Q2 and in future quarters, companies have continued to discuss cost-cutting initiatives to maintain earnings growth rates and profit margins," said FactSet's John Butters on Friday. But with profit margins near record-highs, many agree that we're do for at least some pull back. "Looking forward, however, it is not clear that margins can continue to materially increase, meaning that the baton will need to be passed to revenues in order for earnings to continue pushing higher over the coming quarters," said JPM.JP Morgan Asset Management FREE AppDownload

Brian KuslerThere are now more people working in the solar industry than there are coal miners, according to Politifact. They cite the Solar Foundation, a nonprofit, which counted 142,698 employees in November of 2013 who spend "at least 50% of their time supporting solar-related activities." The foundation says they made 74,000 phone calls and sent 11,000 emails to produce their workforce census. For coal, they reference a 2013 report from U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration saying there were 123,227 coal mining jobs in the U.S.  For now, the workforce for the coal industry writ-large — those who work in transportation and maintenance, for instance — remains larger than for solar, Politifact says.

It’s been nearly six years since the bankruptcy of financial giant Lehman Brothers, an event that triggered a chain reaction of Chapter 11 filings from some of the biggest banks on Wall Street and pulled the country into the Great Recession. More than half a decade out, as the country limps to recovery, you could forgive the walking wounded for being a little wary of big banks. Pundits and politicos have reliably taken up the charge, with countless op-eds asking the same question: Are banks too big to be jailed? In spite of this, public opinion is shifting. A recent Nielsen survey found that the reputation of big banks has improved significantly in the last several years, with the number of positive ratings for financial institutions nearly doubling, from 17 to 32 percent. Several of the biggest banks in the country — Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo — all saw improvements. GoBankingRates GOBankingRates investigated why more Americans like big banks now, finding that the answer is yoked to why they’ve always liked them: Because big banks pay big dividends, and not just to their customers. We surveyed the biggest bank headquartered in every state and the District of Columbia, based on assets (a reliable indicator of size given that the six largest banks in the country own 67 percent of the financial system’s assets), investigating each bank on a number of factors: What we found jibes with increasingly favorable public opinion, but flies in the face of the stigma of the big, bad bank: Big banks actually make huge contributions to their regions that smaller institutions just don’t have the heft to make. They employ millions, pay billions in taxes and offer the highest level of accessibility. In short, they play an integral role in the financial health of their communities — a larger one than they’re often given credit for. One of the most obvious draws of big banks is widespread in-network and branch accessibility. This means fewer out-of-network banking fees and greater access to funds — whether at a brick-and-mortar institution, an in-network ATM, or through online and mobile banking technology. Big banks also offer the most impressive banking technology, which is increasingly important to today’s user base. More than half of all American adults have smartphones, and more and more of them are using their devices to bank online. In fact, the largest share of banking customers in the U.S. — baby boomers — is also one of the most digitally conscious groups. Nearly three-quarters of all baby boomers use online banking services weekly, right in line with younger generations. With the level of accessibility that only big banks can provide, consumers can better manage their money, track their spending and monitor fraud. In short — it pays to be a big bank customer. “With a diverse and vibrant economy, Utah’s future is bright and Chase is proud to be the neighborhood bank for over 425,000 customers across the state,” said Craig Zollinger, JPMorgan Chase market president and CEO for Utah. “We serve thousands of Utahans through our 65 branches and over 140 ATMs, as well as through our award-winning online banking, giving customers a variety of services that help them use and manage Chase accounts virtually anywhere. We continue to be there in support of small businesses throughout Utah, making a difference locally by extending $156 million in credit through over 3,200 loans in 2013.” BMO Harris Bank, Camden National Bank, Capital One, Chase Bank, Fifth Third Bank, First Tennessee Bank, PNC Bank, TD Bank, U.S. Bank and Wells Fargo are among the 45 big banks that offer weekend hours either in-branch or drive-thru hours, 24/7 customer service or night deposits. All 51 big banks surveyed have online banking services; 48 provide mobile banking access through mobile applications for smartphones. Other stand-out services that popped up in the survey included telephone, text banking and online brokerage services. These mobile and online products help customers more closely monitor their account activity, prevent fraud and manage their wealth responsibly. “We take a holistic approach to our investments in the state and providing support and funding for entrepreneurship and innovation has always been central to our community investment efforts,” said Jon Witter, president of retail and direct banking at Capital One. “This year, we invested $150 million to open a new data center in the state of Virginia that will enable us to build essential IT infrastructure capabilities to help us meet customer needs in the increasingly digital world of banking. Our work with local entrepreneurs provides a platform for us to help area businesses and, at the same time, advance efforts to promote job growth and economic vitality in our communities.” Big banks are major figures in the stock and housing markets, but they also have a sweeping impact on employment and state tax revenue, contributing jobs and money without which many of these states would struggle to function. Based off the corporate tax income rates in every state, we found that big banks are contributing upwards of a few hundred million to a few billion dollars in state taxes annually. In the immediate aftermath of the Recession, unemployment skyrocketed from 5 percent in December of 2007 to 10 percent in October of 2009. Ironically, however, the cavalcade of federal reforms that followed the Recession in quick succession has also created a glut of new jobs at big banks, as a 2013 study from Forbes and job search engine Indeed.com found. Increased regulations have boosted the need for more risk managers, compliance officers and all manner of mortgage bankers. Aside from new positions, big banks already employ hundreds of thousands of people — greatly exceeding even the biggest employers among smaller financial institutions. All told, the 51 largest banks employ 1.23 million people — almost 1 percent of the U.S. workforce. “We just celebrated our 162nd anniversary in this state, and with more than 49,000 team members who live here, and over 1,000 locations, we continue to work hard to make sure the customers and communities we serve are successful,” said Lisa Stevens, Wells Fargo regional president for California. “One way we do this is by demonstrating our commitment to small businesses. California needs small business to grow, add jobs and prosper for our economy to grow. We’re helping business owners access the capital and financial services they need to operate their businesses and thrive … We approved a record $440 million in SBA 7(a) loans for California small businesses in federal fiscal year 2013 and remained the state’s top SBA lender in dollar volume for the eighth straight year.” Many big banks offer financial literacy courses, videos and materials to help their customers strengthen their fiscal knowledge. (If anything, the Recession has proven that solid money management skills on an individual level benefit the community as a whole.) Beyond that, all 51 biggest banks have charitable causes they support — a fact that’s not often brought up in the discussion of these institutions. In fact, we found most big banks are using their capital to do great things. “Bank of America’s history in North Carolina began more than 130 years ago,” said Charles Bowman, North Carolina and Charlotte market president for Bank of America. “Today we’re connecting with neighborhoods and communities and investing in the economy of North Carolina through philanthropy and volunteerism. We help local nonprofit organizations develop and grow by focusing our funding on addressing housing, jobs and hunger, three areas important to the vitality of North Carolina.” A few notable contributions include: “PNC has long been committed to serving not only our customers and shareholders, but also the communities where our employees live and work,” said Marcey Zwiebel, vice president and senior manager at PNC Bank. “Our single, largest philanthropic focus in the 19 states and the District of Columbia in which we operate is through PNC Grow Up Great. Recognizing that learning during a child’s early years is essential for their long-term success, we introduced a $350 million, multi-year, Grow Up Great bilingual initiative in 2004 to help prepare children from birth to age 5 for success in school and life.” Big banks are often thought of on a national scale — after all, they certainly have that reach. Our study, however, uncovered the numerous ways these institutions prop of their local communities — through charity, through outreach, through taxes and employment. Account holders might not be aware of the myriad ways their banks support themselves and their state, but, as poll numbers show, they still trust big banks with more than just their banking.

Hedge fund manager Bill Ackman said on CNBC today that he would give the "most important" presentation of his career on Tuesday when he unveils an investigation into Herbalife's nutrition clubs.  In December 2012, Ackman, who runs Pershing Square Capital, gave a 342-slide presentation publicly declaring that he's shorting Herbalife — a multilevel marketing company that sells weight-loss shakes and nutritional supplements.  It's Ackman's contention that the company operates as a "pyramid scheme" that targets lower-income individuals. He believes that regulators, specifically the Federal Trade Commission, will be persuaded to shut it down. Back in March the FTC launched an investigation into the company. Ackman told CNBC that he's going to show everyone on Tuesday why Herbalife will collapse. Shares of Herbalife were last trading 11% lower on Monday. CNBC personality Jim Cramer thinks that Ackman will annihilate the stock.   I reiterate that i expect Ackman to wipe out $HLF because that's his job. When it is your job, that's what you do. I reiterate, Ackman has decided to put $HLF out of business so he will. It is not that hard to do that if you have a ton of money. The stakes are set high for this presentation. FREE AppDownload
The New YorkerThe New Yorker relaunched its website today with a complete makeover, signaling the first step in the magazine's new focus on the web. Part of that initiative is the magazine's decision to open up its archives (2007 to present as well as selected pieces) to the general public for the rest of the summer. Until the website puts up its metered paywall sometime in the fall, the New Yorker editors will be releasing curated collections of stories periodically. We pulled out a selection of our favorite stories from the archives that you should definitely check out while they're free. German-American political theorist Hannah Arendt examined nothing short of the nature of evil in her 1961 reporting on the trial of Nazi SS officer Adolf Eichmann. In her dispatches — which many have called a masterpiece — Arendt coined the phrase "the banality of evil" to describe Eichmann, who she contended was not a "monster" but "terribly and terrifyingly normal." While some have since criticized her conclusions about Eichmann, her work still forms the basis for much of our understanding of the Nazi apparatus.  From the first dispatch: Half a dozen psychiatrists had certified Eichmann as "normal." "More normal at any rate, than I am after having examined him," one of them was said to have exclaimed, while another had found that Eichmann's whole psychological outlook, including his relationship with his wife and children, his mother and father, his brothers and sisters and friends, was "not only normal, but most desirable … Behind the comedy of the soul, experts lay the hard fact that Eichmann's was obviously no case of moral insanity. AP A huge expanse of ruins left the explosion of the atomic bomb on Aug. 6, 1945 in Hiroshima. 140,000 people died because of the disastrous explosion.A little more than one year after the U.S. dropped the atomic bomb on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, The New Yorker dedicated an entire issue to a single article. It was a startling choice necessitated by one of the most momentous acts of destruction in history. In a bid to force its readers to consider "the terrible implications" of the atomic bomb, The New Yorker's John Hersey followed the stories of six survivors immediately prior to the bombing until one year after the bombing. The issue was an unrivaled success. It sold out on newsstands in hours, radio networks broadcast readings of the story with well-known actors, and it became an instant best-seller. From Hersey:  A hundred thousand people were killed by the atomic bomb and these six were among the survivors. They still wonder why they lived when so many others died. Each of them counts many small items of chance or volition — a step taken in time, a decision to go indoors, catching one streetcar instead of the next – that spared him. And now each knows that in the act of survival, he lived a dozen lives and saw more death than he ever thought he would see. At the time, none of them knew anything. AP PhotoActivist and author Rachel Carson, whose book "Silent Spring" led to a study of pesticides, testifies before a Senate Government Operations Subcommittee in Washington, D.C. on June 4, 1963. Few books have had the kind of effect that Rachel Carson's "Silent Spring" had when it was released in 1962. The book, which documented the deleterious effect that widespread use of pesticides have on the environment, was actually first serialized in The New Yorker in June 1962. Carson's work directly led to the modern environmental movement in the U.S. as well the ban of the destructive insecticide DDT. Carson's work played a large role in the creation of the Environmental Defense Fund in 1967 and the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970. From Carson: Only within the moment of time represented by the present century has one species — man — acquired significant power to alter the nature of the world. AP PhotoThis is a 2003 file image obtained by The Associated Press which shows an unidentified detainee standing on a box with a bag on his head and wires attached to him in late 2003 at the Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad, Iraq.Though abuses at Abu Ghraib Prison in Iraq were reported by the media as early as November 2003, it wasn't until dueling reports came out from "60 Minutes" and The New Yorker in 2004 that the scandal was blown wide open. Investigative journalist Seymour Hersh (who made his career by recording another major abuse by the U.S. military) went deep into Abu Ghraib to uncover just how far up the chain of command the abuses went. Hersh revealed that the scandal wasn't an isolated incident (as the Army wanted to portray), but an example of an interrogation program ("Copper Green") that was an official and systemic use of torture. From Hersh: As the international furor grew, senior military officers, and President Bush, insisted that the actions of a few did not reflect the conduct of the military as a whole. Taguba’s report, however, amounts to an unsparing study of collective wrongdoing and the failure of Army leadership at the highest levels. The picture he draws of Abu Ghraib is one in which Army regulations and the Geneva conventions were routinely violated, and in which much of the day-to-day management of the prisoners was abdicated to Army military-intelligence units and civilian contract employees. Interrogating prisoners and getting intelligence, including by intimidation and torture, was the priority. AP Photo/Jean-Marc BoujuTutsi survivors huddle together, Friday, July 1, 1994, to keep warm in Kisesero, 40 miles southwest of Kigali. Though many in the international community knew about the devastation wrought by the Hutus on the Tutsis in Rwanda, New Yorker journalist Philip Gourevitch brought the tragedy into full focus. A year after the Rwandan genocide ended, Gourevitch began traveling to Rwanda for months at a time to try to understand the genocide. He eventually filed eight lengthy articles that covered the story from nearly every angle — Tutsi survivors, imprisoned Hutu killers, the ruling Rwandan Patriotic Front, and Major General Paul Kagame, who later became president. Though Gourevitch has more recently been criticized for his supposedly easy treatment of Kagame, his early dispatches are incredibly revealing stories about how a country begins to heal after a genocide. From the first dispatch: As I traveled around the country, collecting accounts of the killing, it almost seemed as if, with the machete, the nail-studded club, a few well-placed grenades, and a few bursts of automatic-rifle fire, the quiet orders of Hutu Power had made the neutron bomb obsolete. Then I came across a man in a market butchering a cow with a machete, and I saw that it was hard work. His big, precise strokes made a sharp hacking noise, and it took many hacks—two, three, four, five hard hacks—to chop through the cow’s leg. How many hacks to dismember a person? The GuardianThe New Yorker's best-known story form is perhaps the profile. While there are certainly any number of excellent pieces to choose from, New Yorker editor David Remnick's 1998 profile of a middle-aged Muhammad Ali may be his most memorable. Riddled with Parkinson's, the older Ali tries to make sense of his early years to figure out how "a gangly kid from segregated Louisville willed himself to become one of the great original improvisers in American History." From Remnick: Ali still walked well. He was still powerful in the arms and across the chest; it was obvious, just from shaking his hand, that he still possessed a knockout punch. For him, the special torture was speech and expression, as if the disease had intentionally struck first at what had once please him —and had pleased (or annoyed) the world — most. He hated the effort that speech now cost him. MSGT SCOTT REEDJane Mayer's 2009 expose of the CIA's increasing use of drones to kill terrorist suspects in Pakistan revealed that while many in the American public were aware of the drones, few understood that there are two drone programs. The first is a conventional U.S. military program. The second is a clandestine C.I.A.-run targeted-killing program that represents an unprecedented expansion of force in sovereign nations like Pakistan, Yemen, and Libya. Mayer's account revealed how the drone program has become a "radically new and geographically unbounded use of state-sanctioned lethal force," that ultimately signals an endless state of war. From Mayer: At first, some intelligence experts were uneasy about drone attacks. In 2002, Jeffrey Smith, a former C.I.A. general counsel, told Seymour M. Hersh, for an article in this magazine, “If they’re dead, they’re not talking to you, and you create more martyrs.” And, in an interview with the Washington Post, Smith said that ongoing drone attacks could “suggest that it’s acceptable behavior to assassinate people. . . . Assassination as a norm of international conduct exposes American leaders and Americans overseas.” Seven years later, there is no longer any doubt that targeted killing has become official U.S. policy. “The things we were complaining about from Israel a few years ago we now embrace,” Solis says. Now, he notes, nobody in the government calls it assassination. AP PhotoIn November 1957, The New Yorker presented a profile that featured one of the most interesting pairings in American media. Legendary writer Truman Capote was contracted to interview actor Marlon Brando, both of whom were just entering their respective primes. The result is a candid portrait that many consider to be a textbook example of how to reveal the inner life of a notoriously guarded figure. The voice went on, as though speaking to hear itself, an effect Brando’s speech often has, for, like many persons who are intensely self-absorbed, he is something of a monologuist—a fact that he recognizes and for which he offers his own explanation. “People around me never say anything,” he says. “They just seem to want to hear what I have to say. That’s why I do all the talking.” FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Kevin LamarqueU.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen adjusts her glasses as she testifies before the Senate Banking Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington July 15, 2014.The Federal Reserve is very close to achieving its policy goals. In June, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard gave a presentation outlining just how close the Fed was to its stated goals. In that presentation, Bullard argued that not only was the Fed close its current goals, but that the central bank is closer to its policy goals than it has been about 75% of the time since 1960.  And last week, lost in Rick Santelli's on-air meltdown, CNBC economics reporter Steve Liesman made the point that the Fed's policy is to be behind the curve, particularly as it relates to inflation and interest rates. Inflation data tomorrow morning is expected to show that inflation continued to hover at around 2% year-over-year.  So the idea that the Fed is near its policy goals is not a new refrain. As the Fed enters a black out period ahead of next week's July FOMC meeting, Neil Dutta at Renaissance Macro is out with a report that shows how far away from its unemployment projections the Fed might find itself in just a few months.  Dutta notes that the Fed's forecast is for the unemployment rate to be between 6.0% and 6.1% at the end of this year, and between 5.4% and 5.7% at the end of next year.  Job gains, however, have accelerated faster than it appears the Fed was anticipating, which could correspond with a sooner than expected increase in interest rates. Dutta writes that, "In our view, the financial markets underappreciate the uncertainty around the outlook for monetary policy in the face of continued declines in the unemployment rate... If this growth forecast is right, then there are higher risks to earlier rate hikes than markets are discounting."Renaissance MacroAnd citing comments from Fed Chair Yellen, Dutta says Yellen has already hinted at earlier than expected rate hikes. Yellen: "If the labor market continues to improve more quickly than anticipated by the Committee, resulting in faster convergence toward our dual objectives, then increases in the federal funds rate target likely would occur sooner and be more rapid than currently envisioned." Dutta also notes that at best, the labor force participation rate stabilizes, leading to a slower decline in the unemployment rate; but risks exist that a continuing decline in the labor force participate rate could accelerate the pace of decline in the unemployment rate.  Taking the midpoint of recent gains in monthly nonfarm payroll reports, Dutta finds that the unemployment rate could be closer to 5.7% at the end of this year and closer to 5.1% at the end of next year, with both readings far below where the Fed currently expects.

Oxford Said Business SchoolActivist investor Bill Ackman said that on Tuesday he would give "the most important presentation" of his career. "You're going to learn why Herbalife is going to collapse. And that's a pretty strong statement. But this is the largest fraud – public fraud in terms of scale, of countries involved, harm to people," he said on CNBC's "Halftime Report." Ackman has been short Herbalife — a maker of health shakes — since late 2012. Since that time, Ackman has waged a constant campaign against the company, arguing that it's an illegal pyramid scheme. Now he's claiming that he's ready to deliver a final deathblow against the company. Ackman will be unveiling an investigation into Herbalife's nutrition clubs. He says he has hundreds of hours of video, audio, and internal documents to support his claims.  "This will be the most important presentation that I have made in my career. So how's that for raising expectations? But we won't disappoint."  The presentation will be at 9:15 a.m. EDT.  He added that Herbalife's CEO, Michael Johnson, and his team are invited to the event.  "I want to make it very clear that Michael Johnson and his senior management team are welcome to come to the presentation. We'll be happy to sit them in the front row if they would like. We're happy to let them answer questions or even ask questions during the presentation," Ackman said. We'll be covering it live.

NABE, Business InsiderThere has been a recent spike in the percentage of industry economists who said that wages are "rising", according to a new survey from the National Association for Business Economics (NABE). In their 2014 Q2 report, NABE wrote that in the past three months, "43% of respondents' firms raised wages — more than double the share that reported this in July of 2013". Additionally, this is a significant increase from January 2014 — which had 23% of respondents reporting rising wages. This is the third consecutive NABE survey in which respondents reported "rising wages at their firms increased by at least seven percentage points".  This is also the first survey since October 2012 "in which no respondents reported falling wages at their firms". All of this connects to the larger conversation on wage growth. Janet Yellen recently noted that a "significant slack" remains in labor markets, indicated by "continued slow pace of growth in most measures of hourly compensation". However, there have been numerous indications that wage growth might be coming. Additionally, this chart indicates a rising demand for labor — which has historically translated into wage gains.

Bloomberg TVIn his latest Bloomberg View columns, economist Gary Shilling takes issue with peers like Carmen Reinhart, Kenneth Rogoff, Larry Summers, and Robert Gordon that have warned about slowing U.S. economic and income growth. "When an economic phenomenon lasts long enough, economists and academics like to develop theories to show that it will last forever," Shilling writes in a two-part series titled 'Slow-Growth Forecasts Are Wrong' and 'The Boom Is Coming And Sooner Than You Think.' "They are often mistaken." Shilling share a great quote that was wildly wrong: "In his 1843 report to Congress, Patent Office Commissioner Henry Ellsworth said: 'The advancement of the arts, from year to year, taxes our credulity and seems to presage the arrival of that period when human ingenuity must end.'" He argues that despite federal government debt and deficits acting as a major drag on growth, "there is a strong possibility that government debt relative to gross domestic product will fall appreciably, as it did after World War II." Shilling disagrees with the "Reinhart-Rogoff argument — that high government debt depresses GDP — my view is that government debt doesn't depress economic growth, as they contend, but the other way around." He also takes issue with Northwestern University economics professor, Robert Gordon's view that everything worth inventing has already been invented. From Shilling:  "I believe much of today’s new technology -- the Internet, biotechnology, semiconductors, wireless devices, robotics and 3-D printers -- is in its infancy. Collectively, they have the potential to rival the rapid growth and productivity-generating effect of the American industrial revolution and railroads in the late 1800s. Mass-produced autos and the electrification of factories and homes, which led to electric appliances and radio in the 1920s, offer yet more examples. Today, only a third of the world’s population is connected to the Internet but 90 percent live within range of a cellular network. "Sure, productivity (output per hour worked) grew by only 1.5 percent from 2009 to 2012, but that’s normal after a severe recession. I expect it to return to a 2.5 percent annual growth rate -- or more -- after deleveraging is completed in another four years or so. Even in the 1930s, productivity averaged 2.4 percent a year, higher than in the Roaring '20s. In the 1930s, much of the new technology from the 1920s -- electrification and mass production -- was adopted despite the Great Depression. "Rapid productivity growth offsets slower labor force advances. The decline in the labor-force participation rate is likely to slow in coming years once normal economic growth resumes. The rate has fallen as baby boomers retire and discouraged workers drop out of the labor market or stay in college." Shilling expects that once private sector deleveraging is finished, real GDP growth will return to about 3.5% or more. He also thinks "the slow-growth-forever crowd will need to find a new theory." Gary Shilling of course is known to be fairly bearish. His monthly Insight newsletter reminds us of the prevailing 'risk on' climate we see "despite the many warning signs related to economic growth and financial markets here and abroad."

REUTERS/Toby MelvilleThe era of robot-reporting has begun. There are now 163 different websites that feature companies' quarterly earnings reports generated by Automated Insights, the company hired by the Associated Press to take over writing its earnings stories.  Every three months, public firms publish quarterly financial results, showing how much money they brought in. The companies themselves publish a whole bunch of different numbers, but shareholders usually end up only looking for a few: earnings (or net income), earnings per share, and revenues. They also want to know how those figures compared with analysts' expectations and with prior results.  So, you don't necessarily need a live body to pull these figures and organize them into something another person could digest. A quick glance comparing reports reveals how AI's formula works. Here's what AI's Hasbro earnings report from this morning looks like on MSNMoney...

Herbalife's digital media strategy fighting off Bill Ackman's short campaign appears to include comparing the fund manager to Jordan Belfort—a convicted felon who ran a 90s-era boiler room, wrote a best-selling book and had a movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio made about him. On July 17, verified Twitter account @HerbalifeTRUTH tweeted a superimposed an image of Ackman on a "Wolf of Wall Street" movie poster calling him the "Worst of Wall Street." [via NetNet] Paying people to spread bad info isn't ok, but Pershing Square thinks so http://t.co/TXLI34qE0L #WorstOfWallStreet pic.twitter.com/npEDvRd7v0 The Twitter account linked to a press release slamming Pershing Square's short bet against Herbalife. "Ultimately, Pershing Square's campaign is based on propaganda, and we look forward to demonstrating that its assumptions will crumble under serious and independent scrutiny." It's unclear who exactly is behind the @HerbalifeTRUTH Twitter account. It links back to Iamherbalife.com. The two authors listed on the site are Herbalife and Andy Amsler, who works for digital media campaign company Podesta Group. Ackman is loudly short Herbalife—a multi-level marketer that sells weight loss shakes and nutritional supplements. Ackman believes the company operates as a "pyramid scheme" that targets lower income individuals. Herbalife has denied and continues to deny Ackman's accusations.  On Tuesday, Ackman will be giving another one of his presentations on an investigation into how the company operates its nutrition clubs.   "An in-depth analysis and examination of these clubs—which Herbalife claims are simply social gatherings that bring people together to focus on good nutrition and exercise—reveal that they are a core driver of Herbalife’s pyramid scheme," a press release from Pershing dated July 18 said. Ackman has yet to break even on his short.  FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Maxim ZmeyevStocks are lower, with the Dow down about 100 points as the market digests news from Gaza and Ukraine over the weekend. The S&amp;P 500 is down 11 points, or 0.5%, and the Nasdaq is down 23 points, or 0.5%.  President Obama is set to speak on Ukraine shortly, after John Kerry over the weekend said that a "mountain of evidence" points to Russia being responsible for the downed Malaysia Airlines flight on Thursday. The economic calendar was light to start the week, with just the Chicago Fed's national activity index coming in at 0.12 earlier this morning, below expectations for a 0.18 reading. In corporate news, Halliburton and Hasbro were among the notable companies reporting earnings before the market open today.  Halliburton shares were up 0.6% after the company reported earnings per share that grew to $0.91 from $0.73 the prior quarter. Hasbro shares were down 2.5% after the toymaker reported revenue that fell short of expectations. Allergan shares were also up more than 2% after the Botox-maker reported earnings and revenue that beat expectations and announced plans to cut up to 1,500 jobs as part of a restructuring plan.   FREE AppDownload

Picture taken October 22, 2013.In this week's Barron's cover story, Reshma Kapadia highlights six stocks that are set to benefit from a global economic recovery. Kapadia's picks come from four of the market's most under-loved sectors this year: technology, energy, industrials, and financial services.  In the tech space, Kapadia says that data solutions provider Teradata hasn't seen results impacted by competition from start-ups, but is set to benefit from increased sales in Europe. In the energy sector, Chesapeake Energy is still struggling to regain investor confidence after the messy ouster of co-founder and CEO Aubrey McClendon, but Kapadia notes that shares of the company are cheap relative to peers and the company doubled its production forecast for next year.  Industrial majors Caterpillar and Kennametal, which have been out of favor due to concerns over a slowdown in China, should also fare better going forward. Kapadia notes that Caterpillar has cleared excess inventory and seen a slowing decline in its mining business, while Kennametal – which sells specialty tools – should benefit from a pickup in orders in Asia and Europe more quickly than companies that sell more expensive items. Capital One and T. Rowe Price are highlighted in the financial sector. Capital One, Kapadia writes, could have 20% upside if it trades at a valuation closer to regional banks in the future, while T. Rowe Price should benefit as the economy improves and people begin to save more for retirement.  In early trading, shares of Teradata and Chesapeake were down about 0.8%. Caterpillar, Kennametal, and Capital One were roughly unchanged, while T. Rowe Price shares up 0.2%.  Read the whole feature at Barrons.com. FREE AppDownload
Skye Gould/Business InsiderIf we're being honest, London hasn't always been known for its five-star dining options. But a recent culinary revolution has made it a standout destination for gourmands everywhere. We've come up with this ultimate list of the best restaurants in London. To create it, we looked at notable restaurant rankings compiled by food critics, diners, and experts, and gave each restaurant a numerical rating based on our own formula. The rankings we used were the National Restaurant Awards 2014, The World's 100 Best Restaurants, Zagat's Best Food In London 2013, OpenTable's 2013 Best Restaurants in the UK, TimeOut London's Top 50 Restaurants, The Michelin Guide Great Britain and Ireland 2014, and The Square Meal's 3-Star Restaurants.

The LedburyThe Ledbury ranked No. 1 on our list of the best restaurants in London.We recently released our list of the Best Restaurants In London.  To create this list, we looked at seven notable restaurant rankings compiled by food critics, diners, and experts. The rankings we used were the National Restaurant Awards 2014, The World's 100 Best Restaurants, Zagat's Best Food In London 2013, OpenTable's 2013 Best Restaurants in the UK, TimeOut London's Top 50 Restaurants, The Michelin Guide Great Britain and Ireland 2014, and The Square Meal's 3-Star Restaurants. We gave each restaurant a numerical rating based on how many lists the restaurant appeared on and how high it appeared on lists that were ranked. Restaurants that appeared on multiple lists ranked higher on our list, while restaurants that ranked on only one of these lists ended up closer to the bottom.  For the National Restaurant Awards 2014, which was ranked 1 to 100, we calculated the score by using the following formula: 101 - X (restaurant ranking) / 101. With this formula, the highest possible score is 0.99 and the lowest score is 0. Because the World's 100 Best Restaurants looked at restaurants around the world and only five London restaurants made the list, we valued that list higher and gave each London restaurant that made the list a score of 0.75. For the Zagat list, which was ranked 1 to 10, we calculated the score by using the following formula: 10 - X (restaurant ranking) / 10. With this formula, the highest possible score is 0.9 and the lowest score is 0. Each time a restaurant appeared on the OpenTable list, we gave it a score of 0.25, since the restaurants on that list were not ranked. Each time a restaurant appeared on the TimeOut London list, we gave it a score of 0.5, since the restaurants on that list were not ranked. We also valued any Michelin stars awarded, since they are considered one of the most prestigious awards in the food world. Restaurants with one Michelin star received an additional 0.25 to their scores, restaurants with two Michelin stars received an additional 0.5, and restaurants with three stars received an additional 0.75. We awarded an additional 0.25 to restaurants that made The Square Meal's list of 3-star restaurants since the list is not ranked, nor is it updated annually like the other rankings. We then tallied up the scores to create the final ranking. Based on these calculations, the highest possible score would be 4.40 — but that would be incredibly difficult, considering that even the number one restaurant (The Ledbury) scored a 3.95.

ReutersBill AckmanFamed investor Bill Ackman has been in a long-running battle against Herbalife, a maker of health shakes. Ackman is loudly short the company, and believes the business is scam. Anyway, Value investor Whitney Tilson, who runs Kase Capital, writes that Bill Ackman is going to put a nail in Herbalife's coffin tomorrow. "Bill Ackman will be adding his latest nail to Herbalife's coffin in a webcast at 10 am on Tuesday (available at herbalifepyramidscheme.com), where he will reveal what he’s found after a nearly two-year probe of Herbalife's nutrition clubs (of which there are 3,000 in the NY area alone!). If history (and Herbalife’s reaction) are any guide, it should be a doozy. Whether or not you have a position (as I do – it’s one of my largest shorts), this webcast is a must-watch as Ackman’s presentations are always a tour-de-force (rivaled only by David Einhorn’s). To be clear, they’re both not always right, but: a) they’re right a lot more than they’re wrong, as their track records show; and b) if you want to see what incredible in-depth research and analysis look like, look no further," Tilson wrote in a note posted by ValueWalk. In December 2012, Ackman, who runs Pershing Square Capital Management, publicly declared that he is betting $1 billion that Herbalife's stock will go to $0.  Ackman's thesis is that the company operates as a "pyramid scheme" that targets lower income individuals, particularly those from the Hispanic population. Herbalife denied and continues to deny Ackman's accusations. Right after Ackman revealed his short, Herbalife shares collapsed. Once other fund managers, most notably Ackman's long-time rival Carl Icahn, started going long, the stock surged throughout the next year resulting in hundreds of millions in paper losses for Ackman's Pershing Square Capital. Icahn said that he thinks Ackman will be the victim of the "mother of all short squeezes." The two rival hedge fund titans recently made up after more than a year of nasty public insults. Last week, they were on stage together at CNBC's Delivering Alpha Conference where they hugged each other. CNBC host Scott Wapner asked the pair of billionaires, "Who is going to win?"   "It's not about winning. It's not about winning. I would love to find a way to get Carl out of the stock. 17 million shares at $32 a share, he can get out a very nice profit. I would love for him to walk away with a profit. That would be a great outcome for Carl, and that would be wonderful for us. So, you know, Carl, maybe we should have a conversation," Ackman said. Icahn said earlier at the conference that he had not sold a share of Herbalife. "I will say one thing, that we bought — I'm proud of it. We bought 17 million shares at an average of 37, and we haven't sold one share. That's all I can say. I think we have to drop it there." Herbalife's stock is currently trading in the $60 range. Icahn could exit his stake with a $391 million profit. Meanwhile, Ackman still hasn't broken even on his Herbalife short.  A crucial part of Ackman's short thesis is that regulators, particularly the Federal Trade Commission, will be persuaded to shut the company down. Back in March, the FTC opened an investigation into the company. A number of state attorneys generals are probing the company too. Since December 2012, shares of Herbalife are up more than 43%. Year-to-date, though, they're down more than 23%.  FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Carlos BarriaApartment buildings are seen in a residential area at Pudong district in Shanghai August 2, 2013. Rattled by falling home prices, some of the wealthiest Chinese are paring their property investments and turning to private equity or overseas holiday homes, a sign of fading hopes that the once red-hot market can bounce back any time soon.BEIJING (Reuters) - Rattled by falling home prices, some of the wealthiest Chinese are paring their property investments and turning to private equity or overseas holiday homes, a sign of fading hopes that the once red-hot market can bounce back any time soon. "Smart money" checking the exit is a bad omen for any market, especially one considered frothy after a five-year record-breaking bull run, but wealth managers, brokers and analysts say there is no reason for alarm yet. First, the rich are not in a full retreat mode but rather looking to spread the risks more evenly, money managers say. "There are indeed clients choosing to reduce their exposure to the property sector, but it's not a common phenomenon," said an investment strategist at a private banking arm of a large state-owned bank. The banker declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media. Bankers also don't expect investors to simply dump their real estate because the market cools. "Unless someone has an especially big portion of their assets invested in property, he or she would not be in a hurry to sell," said Wang Jing, a deputy general manager at China Merchants Bank's private banking arm. "They would choose to rent their houses to deal with their cash-flow problems." Furthermore, millions of middle-class Chinese, not rich enough to invest abroad and frustrated by official limits on bank deposit rates that barely beat inflation continue to see buying a second or third home as the best investment. Confronted with talk of more price cuts by developers to revive ebbing sales, those investors either hold on to cash and wait or focus more on megacities like Shanghai or Beijing and avoid smaller markets that struggle with oversupply. "The choice of the rich is the view of a minority. We do not think it represents a trend for the masses in future," said Zhao Dazhen, a property analyst at CEBM Group, an investment research firm in Shanghai. "Market uncertainty is keeping most people on the sidelines. Potential buyers will be back once there are signs of a recovery." Data appear to confirm that analysis, with new yuan deposits nearly tripling in June to 3.8 trillion, the biggest jump in at least 12 months. The central bank's second-quarter consumer survey also showed property has not lost its appeal: 14 percent of households said they wanted to buy a new home, roughly the same as a year ago. By contrast, the rich, investment advisers at their side, increasingly choose to shift their money elsewhere in search for better returns rather than wait for prices to level off. China's wealthy have dabbled in foreign real estate in the past and fears that the market has gone too are also not exactly new. What is new is a growing sense that despite a pick-up in home sales volumes last month, the second monthly decline in prices in June might be the beginning of a longer slide.  Well-heeled investors are also shifting funds abroad faster than ever. Realtors in New York, Sydney or London all report how over the past year Chinese buyers became top foreign investors in their markets, snapping up high-end prestige properties. Data from the National Association of Realtors, a  U.S. trade association, showed that the Chinese accounted for about 16 percent of foreign home buyers in the United States in the year ending March 2014, up from 12 percent in 2013 and 2012. Compared with the size of the domestic property market - 8.1 trillion yuan ($1.3 trillion) in sales last year -- outflows are still relatively small and a central bank probe into an offshore investment scheme offered by one of China's major banks might curb investor appetite for foreign assets.  For optimists the limited scale of the foreign property investment and firm belief of many Chinese that a home remains the best store of value suggest that China's housing market is in a "natural correction" rather than on the brink of a slump. Interviews with 10 would-be investors and property brokers in showrooms in Beijing, Shanghai and the southern city of Hangzhou convey that sense of confidence. "Of course I will buy houses for investment," says former investment industry professional Wu Linzhi, 52, while browsing house for sale ads at a real estate broker in Shanghai. "Investing in property is one of the best ways to preserve the value of your cash. This is especially true in China's biggest cities such as Shanghai." Whether China faces a severe property market supply overhang is hotly debated. According to one expert about 20 percent of apartments in Chinese cities stand empty, but others say the figure is exaggerated. For one, it may include homes bought as financial investment where owners have no intention to move in or rent. Central Bank Governor Zhou Xiaochuan recently admitted that policymakers are not sure themselves whether the property market is suffering from a supply glut or simply going through a soft patch caused by the slowing economy and financial stress. For some well-heeled Chinese bad news is just another reason to call a realtor. "I used to buy some wealth management products but stopped immediately after hearing there was a default," said Yu Li, a 43-year-old catering business executive. "So I just put most of my money into the property market. You cannot save your extra money in banks. Banks themselves are in debt, would you dare to give your money to them?"

Ari Wald, a technical analyst with Oppenheimer, is out with a note this morning that outlines five signals that indicate a bull market top. "As it stands," Wald writes, "we think the absence of these signals argue against an imminent end to the cycle." The signals, per Wald, are: Of the arguments Wald outlines in favor the bull market not indicating a top, we think the volatility measure bears close watching. This chart from Wald shows the relationship between the S&amp;P 500 and the VIX, with bull market peaks typically not coming from low VIX readings.  Oppenheimer We've written a lot about volatility through the spring and early summer, and written mostly about the absence of volatility.  Last week, following the news of the Malaysia Airlines plane crash in Ukraine, the VIX, or volatility index, spiked higher by more than 30%.  The next day, the VIX gave up most of these gains. It seems that unless this trend changes, the current bull market should remain in tact.  FREE AppDownload

Getty Images/Justin SullivanApple reports earnings on Tuesday, July 22. A lot has changed since Apple's last reported earnings at the end of April.  Perhaps most important, if you're an investor, Apple's stock is up 26% since its last earnings report.  The reason Apple's stock is up 26% is that last quarter Apple delivered monster iPhone sales. It sold 43.7 million iPhones, up 17% year over year, and well ahead of analyst expectations of 37.7 million. Jackdaw ResearchApple is "the iPhone company," but people don't have a lot of faith in the power of the iPhone. For all of 2013, people thought the iPhone was hanging by a thread. They saw the rise of Samsung and Android, and assumed that Apple was going to be demolished by low-cost, big-screen, good-but-not-great Android phones.  Apple's 2013 holiday quarter confirmed people's worst fears about the iPhone business. Apple sold 51 million iPhones from October to December in 2013 versus 54.7 million expected by sell-side analysts and 56-57 million expected by buy-side analysts. The 51 million units sold was only 7% sales growth.  That's why when Apple delivered strong iPhone sales in the March quarter, the stock took off. It was proof that Apple could sell loads of iPhones and deliver strong growth. Investors didn't even care that Apple's iPad business has gone into the toilet. In the March quarter, Apple sold 16.35 million iPads, down 16% year over year, versus 19.7 million units expected by analysts. Since April, analysts have become much more positive. According to the Bloomberg terminal, 46 Apple analysts rate the stock a buy, 13 call it a hold, and only 4 thinks it's a sell. Citigroup, which was bearish on the stock, changed its analyst coverage and rated the stock a new "buy." JMP securities upgraded the stock to outperform Monday morning. Other analysts have raised their price target.  Part of the reason analysts have become more positive on Apple is that they're expecting a monster fall. Apple is expected to release two new iPhones with bigger screens, as well as the iWatch, which will be a brand-new wearable product, its first new product category since the iPad.  Analyst Gene Munster of Piper Jaffray is so confident Apple is going to deliver this quarter, he says in a note Monday, "the biggest risk is likely 'disappointing' September guidance," which would only happen if the iPhone was coming later than expected. And even then, it wouldn't matter because "we believe investors would ultimately look past it and refocus on new products (larger screen iPhone, iWatch, iPads) in the fall." Normally, iPhone sales are really weak this quarter as people stop buying them in anticipation of the next model coming in a few months. Sherri Scribner at Deutsche Bank says that might not be a huge drag on the iPhone this year because, "Over the past year, Apple has added 51 new carrier relationships, including China Mobile (with 785 million subscribers) and NTT DoCoMo." Overall, Scribner says, "We expect Apple’s fiscal Q3 2014 to be relatively unexciting, as both the iPhone and iPad are now well into their product cycles. We are modeling iPhone units of 36M, down 18% quarter-over-quarter, which is about in line with typical seasonality in front of a new iPhone announcement of down 16% quarter-over-quarter." Citi's Jim Suva also thinks this quarter is something of a nonevent. He says, "We do NOT expect Apple’s earnings on July 22 to be either a negative or a positive catalyst for the stock as we believe consensus accurately estimates EPS near $1.22." Basically, everyone is waiting for next quarter when Apple unleashes its next line of products. That puts Apple in a great position this quarter. Unless it totally blows the quarter, investors aren't going to care. They have their eyes on the fall. Here, via Piper Jaffray, are the numbers everyone will be watching for: FREE AppDownload
MarathonU.S. oil production remains at its highest level since the mid-80s, and it's all thanks to incredible developments in hydraulic fracturing. Marathon Oil has a great animation on the basics of hydraulic fracturing, or "fracking."  We found it thanks to Mark Perry's blog. Intended for novices, it explains how horizontal drilling works and explains the roles of water and sand. Not surprisingly, the video doesn't spend much time on the controversies surrounding the environmental risks.  That discussion is for another time.

REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz William Ackman, founder and CEO of hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management, speaks at the Sohn Investment Conference in New York, May 5, 2014. Activist investor Ackman said on Monday that he recommends the shares of mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac because the companies have low liquidity risk. Allergan is cutting jobs. Along with its second quarter earnings results this morning, Allergan announced "stockholder value enhancements," which include cutting 1,500 jobs, or approximately 13% of its current global headcount, and eliminate approximately 250 vacant positions. Allergan is currently fending off a takeover bid from Valeant and activist investor Bill Ackman, which this morning announced that it contracted the SEC and regulatory authorities in Canada regarding, "Allergan's apparent attempt to mislead investors and manipulate the market for Valeant common shares by continuing to make false and misleading statements regarding Valeant's business despite Valeant's public statements correcting such information." Specifically, Valeant takes issue with Allergan's assertions in an SEC filing last week that said the performance of Valeant's Bausch &amp; Lomb unit is overstated.  In addition to cutting jobs, Allergan announced that it will execute a restructuring plan that the company expects will save it approximately $475 million in 2015. The company says these savings, "will come from efficiencies and reductions in spend across the commercial organization, general and administrative functions, manufacturing and the research and development organization." Allergan also said that, "Additional strategic options are available including business development / acquisitions and capital return." In light of the company's attempt to fend off Valeant's takeover bid, the restructuring measures shouldn't come as a complete surprise. Reducing headcount and cutting expenses can be seen as proactive measures from Allergan's management as it seeks to assure current shareholders that the company will be better off on its own. Allergan said that its strategic plan, which runs through 2019, should deliver compound annual earnings growth of more than 20%, with the company estimating full-year earnings per share of $10 in 2016. This year, the company expects to earn between $5.74 and $5.80 per share. As for Allergan's second quarter results, the company reported earnings per share, excluding certain items, of $1.51, better than the $1.44 that was expected by analysts. The Botox-maker's net product sales also totaled $1.83 billion, better than the $1.77 billion that expected by analysts. FREE AppDownload
Wikimedia CommonsBuenos AiresArgentines could be forgiven for being a little down these days. There’s the World Cup, for starters. And then there’s the fact that the country is fighting tooth and nail with international creditors over $1.5 billion in soured bonds. Of course, things can change. Argentine officials have every incentive to work out a deal, but they better hurry: time is running out. This isn’t their first debt payment rodeo. Argentina defaulted on $95 billion in external debt in late 2001, ushering in a period of sharp currency devaluation, inflation, increased poverty and foreign capital flight. The country’s inability to fully right the ship in the 13 years since hasn’t restored much confidence either. In 2005 and again in 2010, though, the country agreed on a bond exchange for 92 percent of the original debt it defaulted on, and it has so far remained current on those obligations. But the remaining 8 percent is still very much a factor: Argentina says that paying all holdouts in full would cost approximately $15 billion including interest and penalties. Among the holdouts are U.S. hedge funds Elliott Management Corp., Aurelis Capital Management LP and Olifant Fund. They’ve sued for full repayment, and a U.S. district judge in 2012 ordered Argentina to pay them what now amounts to some $1.5 billion. Late last month, Argentina tried to make a $539 million payment that was due to the restructured bondholders, but the judge forbade it to do so until it had compensated the holdouts, and the payment was halted. The bonds stipulate that the country has a 30-day grace period—until July 30—to pay or fall into default yet again. But with less than two weeks to go, government officials and the holdouts seem to be putting more energy into ramping up their repayment rhetoric than into negotiations. Still, Argentina has quite an incentive to reach a deal. Settling with the holdouts is the primary remaining obstacle for the country to regain access to international markets the country has been shut out of for more than a decade. Doing so would likely increase capital inflows and lower the cost of borrowing at a time when Argentina is grappling with declining foreign reserves and one of the world’s highest inflation rates. Tapping into new sources of financing could help Argentina fund its fiscal deficit without having to print money, which would have the dual benefit of slowing inflation and relieving pressure on the currency. A deal would also help sentiment among Argentines tired of the drawn-out default drama. Judging by its recent conduct, the country does seem to want to put the drama to bed once and for all. In May, it agreed to pay $9.7 billion over five years to the Paris Club of creditor nations to settle claims from the 2001 default. It also reached a deal to pay Spanish oil company Repsol SA $5 billion for assets it expropriated two years ago. “Its willingness to settle these cases can be interpreted as a sign that getting back to the market is critical for them,” says Casey Reckman, a vice president in Emerging Markets Economics Research for Credit Suisse. “Ultimately, it makes more sense for Argentina to negotiate a settlement.” The best-case scenario is one in which Argentina pays off as much of its debt as possible through the issuance of new bonds, obviating the need for spending any of its dwindling foreign reserves, which recently stood at $29 billion. Risk-seeking investors have been encouraged by these olive branches to foreign creditors, and a settlement with the holdouts would likely boost investor confidence even more. According to Daniel Chodos, an emerging markets fixed income strategist at Credit Suisse, a deal could lower yields on the Discount ’33 bond, Argentina’s benchmark, to between 6 and 7 percent — still much higher than comparable Brazilian 10-year bond yields of 4.3 percent – but well below their current level of around 10 percent. Of course, Argentina could still dig in its heels and let the rest of the month pass in standoff mode. And in the event they miss the 30-day deadline, the peso will likely weaken, inflation could accelerate and domestic demand could take a hit. They would then be in a position known as “soft default” — one driven by a legal squabble and not an actual inability to pay. If they can come to terms on a settlement, though, Argentina would presumably be able to quickly exit default status. That’s quite different from its hard default in 2001, when the country was dead broke. It also took four years—ironically, the time between World Cups—before it was able to come to terms with the majority of creditors on the restructuring. So why not just pay the holdouts and get it over with, especially since Argentina has the reserves to afford it? Officials say that would set a dangerous precedent that could encourage the other holdout creditors to seek full repayment – in cash – which they estimate would cost as much as $15 billion. “That’s very unlikely to happen,” Reckman says. “For everyone, the incentives are aligned to reach a settlement.” But the clock is ticking.

AP/Matt DunhamThe leader of Britain's opposition Conservative Party David Cameron speaks beside a portrait of Sir Winston Churchill during his monthly news conference in London, Tuesday, Oct. 27, 2009.Britain will push for EU sanctions targeting whole sectors of the Russian economy in the wake of the Ukraine plane disaster even if it means taking a short-term "hit" to the economy, its ministers said on Monday. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said "the time has now come for sanctions to be tightened further", and stressed that inaction so far over the Ukraine crisis had "not served us well". EU foreign ministers meet on Tuesday to decide whether to impose sanctions if Russia does not press Ukraine's pro-Kremlin separatists to allow access to the crash site of flight MH17 and reduce Moscow's support for the rebels. British Prime Minister David Cameron was due to address parliament on the issue later Monday. Ten Britons were among the 298 people killed when their passenger jet crashed after what is believed to be a strike by a surface-to-air missile. "We believe the time has now come for sanctions to be tightened further and that is precisely what we will be seeking to deliver in the meetings in the EU later this week," Clegg told a monthly news conference. He said it was time for the EU to move to "Tier 3" sanctions against Russia, which would block access to European markets for whole sectors of the Russian economy such as gas and oil. "Let's be clear, in doing so there might be some short-term economic effects in the UK as there would be in other European member states, but a failure to act with the right collective resolve in the EU, in my view, has not served us well in the last seven months." So far Brussels has only imposed second tier sanctions such as travel bans and asset freezes on members of Putin's inner circle. British finance minister George Osborne made a similar call for tougher sanctions. "Any sanctions will have an economic impact and we are prepared to undertake further sanctions," he told BBC radio. "But think of the economic 'hit' of allowing international borders to be ignored, of allowing airlines to be shot down -- that's a much greater economic hit for Britain that we are not prepared to just allow that to happen." The EU has made preparations for third tier sanctions over the crisis in Ukraine but has not yet brought them into effect. Britain and some eastern European states have been pushing for tougher action against Moscow. However, London believes others are more reluctant, such as Germany, which relies on Russian energy supplies, and France, which has a contract to supply Russia with two warships.

Thomson ReutersMurdoch, executive chairman of News Corporation, speaks during a panel discussion at the B20 meeting of company CEOs in Sydney(Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch's plan to buy Time Warner would help the Twenty-First Century Fox chairman make larger inroads in China, a fast-growing market that media moguls are finding hard to crack. Time Warner's board rejected Murdoch's $80 billion offer, but the Fox chairman is expected to continue the chase. A deal would create a giant with more than $37 billion a year in revenues in the United States and Canada. It would also nearly double the revenues Fox generates from the emerging media markets in Latin America and Asia/Pacific. "He sees 3 billion new consumers coming into the market and a rising middle class in China and India, and mobile devices and strong demand for content," said Mario Gabelli, the CEO of GAMCO Investors, in an interview with Reuters Insider, "He's going to be able to create Netflixes of his own." Gabelli owns shares of both Fox and Time Warner. Last year, Fox generated 42 percent of its revenue outside the United States and Canada. The company's Asian revenues, including those in Japan and China, grew by 40 percent, to $2.1 billion, over two years. Time Warner's collection of cable channels would compliment Fox's programming in key territories. In Latin America, where Fox faces off against large local players, Time Warner's Turner unit operates Chilevision, a large broadcaster in Chile, and also shows its TNT entertainment channel, Cartoon Network and locally tailored regional channels such as the kids channel Tooncast. Turner offers three well-regarded channels in India, POGO, Cartoonito and Toonami, which could help Murdoch's Indian programming behemoth Star India, which broadcasts 44 channels in seven languages. HBO would likely be Fox's big draw in foreign markets. The pay channel, with a history of hit programs such as "The Sopranos," has around 84 million subscribers outside the United States, beaming its shows into more than 70 countries, and sells programming from HBO and Cinemax into 150 countries. In China, with Time Warner in the fold, Murdoch would be able to focus more squarely on profiting from what movies and TV shows the government allows. In January, he sold Fox's 47 percent stake in Star China TV, which owns three 24-hour Mandarin channels, and in October sold off Fox's remaining stake in Chinese TV company Phoenix Satellite Television. These move come in the face of restrictions on foreign ownership of China media assets. "Murdoch is not unique. The Chinese government says, 'We cannot let these people control our media,'" said William Yu, an economist at UCLA's Anderson School of Management, who focuses on emerging Asian economies. A Fox spokesman had no comment. In recent earnings calls and conferences, Fox President Chase Carey has stressed the company's strategy of selling off assets it couldn't own. "Long term, I still think that you ultimately want to either own and operate or monetize," he said at a UBS media conference in December. Doug Young, a professor at Fudan University Journalism School, cautioned against overestimating the potential in China. "Taking two studios and combining, you’ll get a company with twice as many growth prospects in China, but in terms of either having many assets in China, it’s just a market for licensing and selling," he said. Still, the China potential is alluring. Consulting and audit firm EY estimates revenue from China's media and entertainment industry will reach $138 billion by 2015, from $59 billion in 2010. The country already has embraced streaming video and EY sees advertising revenue jumping. Its mobile web users, the most in the world, are expected to hit 750 million by 2017, according to data from China-based consultancy iResearch. Currently, China limits to 34 the total number of movies foreign companies can import. China's box office last year grew 27 percent, to $3.6 billion, second only to the $10.9 billion million U.S. market. "Transformers: Age of Extinction," a movie distributed by Viacom's Paramount studio, has so far sold more tickets in China than the United States. With its muscular films such as the "Harry Potter" and "Lord of the Rings" fantasy franchises, Time Warner's Warner Brothers studio gets frequent quota approval. "China is a great market and we've all wanted to be there for years," said former Viacom president Frank Biondi, one of the first U.S. media executives to visit the country. "But for all the upside, there's the obvious downside that the government controls everything - what gets put into movie theaters, what's put on TV." A merger would allow Murdoch to use the Warner Brothers studio to claim more quota slots. In 2013, seven Warner Brothers films were granted a release in Chinese theaters, and six for Fox, according to Box Office Mojo. Fox's Hollywood studio last year produced 14 movies, to Warner Brothers' 25 films. Fox has also agreed to co-produce five Chinese language films with Chinese studio Bona Film Group. Warner's movies generated $155.9 million from three of its films that ranked in China's top 20 last year, including "Gravity" and "Man of Steel." Fox's three films in the top 20, including "The Wolverine," generated $80 million, according to Box Office Mojo. A few of Time Warner's Cartoon Network shows appear on the state-owned China Central Television, and its HBO pay channel provides a five-hour block of programming as well. HBO's offering included a censored version of its fantasy hit "Game of Thrones". "It's a huge opportunity," said former Paramount President Sid Ganis, whose Jiaflix company advises movie companies in China, "and media companies are only now beginning to figure the market out."

Dr. Ed's BlogAs I’ve noted before, bear markets tend to coincide with sharp increases in the Misery Index. It is the average of the unemployment rate and the core PCED inflation rate. The index was down to 7.8% during May from the most recent cyclical peak of 11.5% during March 2010. The unemployment rate has dropped from 6.7% at the end of last year to 6.1% during June. If it continues to drop at this rate over the rest of the year, it will be down to 5.5% by December. Inflation has edged up recently, but is likely to remain subdued around 1.5%. Nevertheless, if the jobless rate continues to plunge, the Fed will be hiking rates sooner rather than later. Right now early next year is possible, and late this year can’t be ruled out. That might trigger financial tremors including a correction in stock prices. However, the US economy should prove remarkably resilient, which would augur well for a secular bull market.Dr. Ed's Blog Today's Morning Briefing: US Is Outstanding. (1) The next bear market.

However, markets bounced back sharply on Friday. Markets continue to be incredibly resilient despite these shocks that threaten to destabilize the geopolitical status quo. For now, investors seem to be more focused on the major economic themes that are out there. They're paying attention to the recent boom in M&amp;A.

"Don’t tell me there are already a lot of deals," he wrote. "I am talking about a veritable explosion, to levels never seen before." Grantham's reasons include cheap debt, high profit margins, slack in the labor market, and low capital spending. "I think it is likely (better than 50/50) that all previous deal records will be broken in the next year or two," he continued.

afp.com / Getty / Rick GershonThe Severstal Wheeling South Works Steel Plant on May 5, 2009 in the village of Mingo Junction, Ohio.Russia's steel giant Severstal announced on Monday the sale of its North American plants to US companies for a total of $2.3 billion (1.7 billion euros). Severstal is selling Severstal Columbus (Mississippi) to Steel Dynamics and Severstal Dearborn (Michigan) to AK Steel Corporation, the company said. AK Steel said separately that its acquisition was worth $700 million. The sale would be completed "by year-end 2014," Severstal's statement said. "The work to prepare and sign the agreements to sell the assets was launched in the end of 2013 and has now been successfully finalized," it said. Severstal specialises in steel for the auto sector and household goods and is controlled by billionaire Alexei Mordashov. The company had explained its disposal of foreign assets as a cost-cutting move, but the final sale also comes amid the worsening standoff over Ukraine between Moscow and Washington, which last week introduced its toughest round of sanctions yet against Russian companies. Kommersant daily said on Monday that Severstal was particularly at risk of being hit eventually by sanctions because Mordashov iwas also a stakeholder in Bank Rossiya, a Russian bank put on the Treasury's blacklist in March. Last week Severstal also announced that it was selling its US coal producer PBS Coal to Canadian Corsa Coal Corp for $140 million by the end of August.  Copyright (2014) AFP. All rights reserved.

AFPSouth Korea's capital Seoul said Monday it planned to ban the smartphone car-hailing service Uber, saying it raised passenger safety issues and threatened the livelihood of licensed taxi drivers. The Uber app which allows clients to connect directly with "black car" services was launched in Seoul in August last year. But the city council said it bypassed strict controls imposed on licensed taxi drivers, including background checks, insurance and vehicle upkeep and safety. "We are looking into related laws to block Uber and similar apps that arrange such illegal transportation activities," the council said in a statement. "Uber users should be aware that it's hard to be covered by insurance even if a car accident occurs, let alone the issues of potential mechanical problems and background of drivers," it said. The council said it would roll out its own mobile app for hailing existing, licensed taxis in December. "Uber is charging customers while avoiding the regulatory process, which creates unfair competition for taxi drivers and encroaches on their business," it said. California-based Uber is the most prominent of the apps that are shaking up the traditional taxi landscape in cities around the world. It has already faced significant resistance from regulators in several countries, who accuse it of unfair competition and lack of standards. The firm also sparked angry protests by cab drivers in nations including France, the US and Germany who fear it is chipping away at their client base. Uber operates in 41 countries in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and the Asia-Pacific. Copyright (2014) AFP. All rights reserved.

REUTERS/Eloy Alonso Children run from the Fire Bull, a man carrying a metal structure shaped as a bull's head stuffed with fireworks, at the San Fermin festival in Pamplona July 8, 2014. In his latest note, JPM's Jan Loeys presents the simple case for being bullish on the market. The argument is essentially: All of the fundamentals, including an improving economy, and low volatility remain in place. Nothing has changed that would derail the market. We accept such correction risks, but see only modest near-term downside that may anyway be quite difficult to trade, as the fundamentals behind the rally in stocks are to us largely intact. Low implied volatilities make it relatively cheap to hedge such downside, though. The fundamentals we focus on remain the lack of any return on cash and generally low market and economic volatility. Incoming economic data and surveys are raising our confidence that global and US growth is set to rebound to a 3% handle in H2, after a dismal and unexplained weak H1. The major first GDP report for Q2, China, came in just above our expectations, reducing fear on the downside. Forward looking PMIs suggest a strong Q3, even as we accept that this signal has not functioned well so far this year. Q2 earnings reports are also coming in well above expectations (see equity section below). FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersConstruction workers stand on scaffolding at an apartment building under construction in HollywoodWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The share of U.S. companies raising wages more than doubled in the three months to July from a year ago, a survey showed on Monday, suggesting a faster pace of wage growth. The National Association for Business Economics' (NABE) latest business conditions survey found that 43 percent of the 79 economists who participated said their firms had increased wages. That compared to only 19 percent last year and marked an increase from 35 percent in the three months to April. "For the third survey in a row, an increasing share of panelists reported rising wage costs last quarter," said NABE President Jack Kleinhenz, who is also chief economist at the National Retail Federation. It was the first time since October 2012 that no respondents reported declining wages at their firms. The economists represented a broad spectrum of businesses, including goods-producing, transportation, finance and services industries. Forty percent of the firms employ more than 1,000 people. The NABE survey is the latest to suggest an upturn in the wage cycle. The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) survey's compensation index is hovering at a six year high. This index has been trending higher since late 2013 and is closely correlated with a broader measure of wage growth. While Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen maintains wage growth is still a long way from igniting inflation, the anecdotal evidence of faster wage growth has some economists worried the U.S. central bank could be slow to raise interest rates and end up with an inflation problem. In the July quarter, the NABE showed 59 percent of respondents in the finance, insurance and real estate sector reported raising wages. In the transportation, utilities, information and communications sector, half of the respondents said they had increased wages. In the services sector, 35 percent reported wage increases, while in the goods producing sector the share was 11 percent. "It's not surprising that we would see some reporting of rising wage costs. As we get to the point where we have less in the labor market to supply, I think firms are recognizing that's something that they have to do," said Kleinhenz. "If there has been a chronic shortage of supply for skilled labor, you may need to raise wages for certain occupations." Wage growth expectations for the third quarter's growth were a bit lower, with 35 percent of respondents expecting increases. None, however, anticipated a decline in wages. The share of businesses increasing employment jumped to 36 percent in the July quarter from 29 percent a year ago. That was up from 28 percent in the April quarter. While the share of businesses reporting they could not find qualified workers slipped three-tenths of a percentage point to 22 percent, skills shortages remained the dominant theme.   (Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama) FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/ Edgard GarridoMexican billionaire tycoon, Carlos SlimMexican billionaire tycoon, Carlos Slim, has called for the introduction of a three-day working week, offset by longer hours and a later retirement, as a way to improve people’s quality of life and create a more productive labour force. Slim made the comments when speaking to a business conference in Paraguay, suggesting that the workforce could be spread over a full week, with employees working up to 10 or 11 hours a day. “With three work days a week, we would have more time to relax; for quality of life,” the Financial Times reports Slim saying. The business conference, Growing Together – States and Enterprises, was held in Asuncion and was attended by business and political leaders from across Latin America. “Having four days [off] would be very important to generate new entertainment activities and other ways of being occupied,” Slim said. He said current retirement ages come from a time of lower life expectancies, and should rise to 70 or 75. Slim – routinely identified as one of the two richest people in the world – is the CEO of Telmex, a fixed phone line communications company which recently offered its employees a new form of contract. Telmex employees who joined in their teens can access early retirement, and anyone who wants to work beyond retirement can do so at full pay but a reduced load of four days a week. Slim, who is also the head of mining company Minera Frisco, is estimated to have a personal net worth of $80bn – around the same as Bill Gates. Some small companies in Australia have instigated a four-day week flexible workplace policy, and advocates cite improvements in employee health and environmental impact as possible benefits.

The move is a potential concern for the two brands, which are both now conducting their own investigation into the matter, since the pair were hit hard by a food safety scandal in China late in 2012. Yum, which apologized to Chinese consumers for any inconvenience caused in the latest case, suffered a sharp dive in profits early in 2013 after the safety concerns.

The SFDA inspected Shanghai Husi on Sunday evening after a local television channel broadcast a program claiming an undercover reporter had seen the use of expired meat and poor hygiene practices in a local factory, local media said.
