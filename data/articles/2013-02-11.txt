APNorth Korea confirmed early Tuesday that it had successfully conducted its widely anticipated third underground nuclear bomb test, according to The Associated Press. It said it was conducted in a "safe and perfect" manner. Earlier, the U.S. Geological Survey said¬†that it had detected a 4.9-magnitude earthquake in North Korea in an area of previous nuclear tests, which fueled suspicion throughout the night that North Korea may have conducted the test. Later, the AP and¬†Reuters¬†both reported that South Korea confirmed North Korea's nuclear test, which represents an escalation in tension with Asia and the west from young leader Kim Jong Un. The area of the reported seismic activity had no historical precedence of¬†earthquakes or other natural seismic hazardous activity, according to the USGS. North Korea has conducted two previous nuclear tests, in October 2006 and May 2009. The 2006 test registered 4.1 magnitude activity, and the 2009 test registered a 4.5. This test is the first under Kim Jong Un. In January, North Korea threatened to conduct a "higher-level" test to protest¬†tightened sanctions over a¬†"successful" long-range rocket launch in December. In a statement,¬†The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization said that the new test is "roughly congruent with the 2006 and 2009 DPRK nuclear tests."¬† "[T]his act would constitute a clear threat to international peace and security, and challenges efforts made to strengthen global nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, in particular by ending nuclear testing," said¬†Tibor T√≥th, the executive secretary of the CTBTO. United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon strongly condemned the test in a statement. "It is a clear and grave violation of the relevant Security Council resolutions," he said.  "It is deplorable that Pyongyang defied the strong and unequivocal call from the international community to refrain from any further provocative measures. ...¬†The Secretary-General is gravely concerned about the negative impact of this deeply destabilizing act on regional stability as well as the global efforts for nuclear non-proliferation." The nuclear test comes just hours before President Barack Obama is scheduled to give his State of the Union address, a speech that was set to focus mainly on the domestic economy. Obama is also set to call for a world reduction in nuclear arms, according to the New York Times.
Wikimedia CommonsThe U.S. has been able to sit back and watch as Europe struggles to hold its currency union together. Americans can safely assume there is no danger Illinois, as bad as its finances are, will drop out and issue its own currency in "Lincolns." It wasn't always so. For a quarter of a century, America's states and territories, and the institutions within them, began circulating their own currency, as the agrarian mistrust of centralized banking eventually climaxed in the destruction of the Second Bank of the United States in 1832. This period is well known among collectors and numismatists. But for others ‚Äî even within the banking industry itself ‚Äî this period remains mostly unknown. We wanted to shed some light on this colorful but important moment in the country's growth.

Japan's stock market is going nuts today. The Nikkei is up 2.3% Nikkei The main reason? This weekend, Japan's economic minister Akira Amrai said that it was a goal for the Nikkei to hit 13,000 by the end of March. Japan's market has already been on a mega-tear, and now the economic minister is aiming for another 17% rally by the end of March? We have no recollection of a senior economic official in a developed economy saying anything like this before. So is it smart? Felix Salmon says it's worth a shot, based on wealth effect argument. I like this move: it shows imagination, and the upside is much bigger than the downside. The worst that can happen is that it doesnít work, and the stock market ends up doing what the stock market would have done anyway; the best that can happen is that it helps accelerate the broad recovery that everybody in Japan is hoping for this year. But in addition to raising asset prices, it does something else, it makes the government look economically reckless. That's a good thing. Already the new PM Shinzo Abe has taken several steps down this path, including his goal to have the Bank of Japan be subsumed by the Ministry of Finance, a violation of the cherished principal of central bank independence. Why is this a good thing? Because when you're in a deflationary trap, the economy becomes a victim of the central bank's credibility. People don't believe that inflation can be left to run, because they assume that the central bank will put a clamp down as soon as things get going. As Paul Krugman recently explained to us in an interview, Japan is solving that, by committing to be irresponsible. The 13,000 pronouncement furthers that goal. An inflation target here. Unlimited QE there. A Nikkei target here. Suddenly people believe that the government is going to put the pedal to the floor and let things run a bit.
The publication ran a†review of the company's Model S sedan that claimed the car's battery life didn't last the length of his trip from Washington D.C. to New York, even though he did everything that Tesla advised to do. Musk hit back, calling Times reporter†John Broder's claims "fake."† One of Musk's followers referred him to one of Broder's stories from March 2012 in which he downplayed the future of the electric car. That riled Musk up even more. @satinsilence Wow, no surprise that Broder wrote a hit piece on Tesla. I guess we were pretty dumb to agree to an article by this guy. "...the state of the electric car is dismal, the victim of hyped expectations, technological flops, high costs and a hostile political climate,"†wrote Broder.

"40 Million Mistakes: Is your credit report accurate?"Consumer activists were rattled Monday after the FTC released a report on widespread credit reporting errors. According to the agency, as many as one in five consumers have errors on their credit reports that could hinder their ability to apply for new credit or stick them with sky high interest rates. † The report was highlighted in a fascinating 60 Minutes segment by CBS' Steve Kroft. "Besides having financial consequences, the whole dispute process takes an emotional toll on people," Kroft said in an†extended interview. "It's just really hard sometimes to get these things fixed. You feel like you're up against this machine and there's no way to break through. After a while I think people sometimes start to question their own sanity.... so we decided to show the consumer what it's like."† From what we've learned from his six-month investigation and two new reports on the credit reporting industry, it's more evident than ever that consumers are in need of real change.†
The Japanese yen ‚Äì arguably the hottest currency trade in the world right now ‚Äì continues to sink against the U.S. dollar. Today's move marks the yen's biggest dive against the dollar in over two weeks and comes on the heels of the Japanese currency's recent strengthening over the past few trading sessions. Today, it's breaking through new lows in its recent journey downward ‚Äì right now, it's trading around 94.30 to the dollar versus where it opened last night, around 92.72. FINVIZ The yen is likely getting hit today due to strength in the dollar and the euro. Earlier, comments from Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann, who stated that the euro is not seriously overvalued, caused the common currency to go higher. On Saturday, while currency markets were closed, the Japanese economy minister said that the government wanted to see the Nikkei surge 17 percent from its current levels by the end of March. The Tokyo Stock Exchange was closed today for the holiday, so observers were unable to gauge the stock market's reaction. However, stock index price appreciation implies a lower yen, so that is likely contributing to the currency's decline as well.

President Barack Obama has been pretty vocal about what he thinks of the current state of gun regulations‚Äîthey're nowhere near as strict as he thinks they should be. But his battle for stricter gun laws will be exactly that: a battle. The gun industry is booming. The demand for guns and ammo has never been higher. In 2012, the FBI conducted more background checks on people who wanted to buy guns than ever before.¬† So are profits. Since Obama took office in 2008, profits for some gun manufacturers are up almost 200%. In 2012, the American industry for guns and ammunitions totaled about $12 billion, according to an estimate by the IBIS group. In 2011, gun companies paid more than $5 billion in federal, state and excise taxes, according to the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a pro-gun organization. This interactive map shows how many people were employed by the gun industry in each state:  With 10,835 workers, there were more people employed in the gun industry in California than anywhere else in the United States. In second place is Texas, which employed 5,986 people in the gun industry in 2012. The Strum &amp; Ruger Co (RGR), a Connecticut-based firearms manufacturer, made ¬†$40 million in profits on sales worth $328.8 million in 2011, according to the company's annual statement. The company's profits are up almost 200% since Obama took office. Smith &amp; Wesson (SWHC), another popular but relatively small gun maker, made a profit of $16 million in from mid-2011 to mod-2012 by selling $411.9 million worth of guns and ammo, according to the company's annual statement. The company's profits are up nearly 140% since Obama took office. This interactive map shows how many background checks of people who wanted to purchase guns the FBI conducted in each state:  There's a reason why the gun industry is so profitable: There's a huge market for them. The number of gun-purchase related background checks the FBI conducts is a pretty good indicator of how many people want to buy firearms. In 2012, the FBI conducted 19,463,832 background checks, according to FBI data. Not surprisingly, the underground market for guns is also pretty robust: 62 percent of private gun sellers would have agreed to sell a firearm to a buyer who couldn‚Äôt pass a background check, according to data from an undercover investigation by New York City public officials. This interactive map shows by how much the number of background checks conducted by the FBI increased or fell in each state:  Kentucky saw the highest increase in gun-related background checks, while that number decreased quite¬†dramatically in Utah, and to a lesser degree, in Indiana.

Julia La Roche for Business InsiderControversy is again casting a shadow over the multilevel marketing industry, as nutritional supplement company Herbalife Inc., which has thousands of distributors in the Chicago region, has been publicly called a pyramid scheme by a prominent investor -- an allegation the company vigorously denies. Meanwhile, a different multilevel marketer, Fortune Hi-Tech Marketing, was shut down in recent weeks after a lawsuit was brought by regulators and several states, including Illinois, alleging the company scammed consumers out of $169 million. The scheme affected an estimated 100,000 Americans, including some in Chicago, where it targeted Spanish-speaking consumers, the Federal Trade Commission alleged. Most people outside the industry might have only a vague notion about multilevel marketing, also called network marketing and direct selling. It often involves personal sales of cosmetics, wellness products or home decor items -- or as critics flippantly call it, "pills, potions and lotions" -- usually sold through product parties hosted by friends or relatives. For sellers, the companies offer the appeal of starting a business on the cheap with little training, working from home and being their own boss, if only for part-time money. Some might recruit friends and family to become sellers, which augments their own commissions and gives them a shot at the six-figure compensation many such marketing companies tout but few distributors attain. The largest multilevel marketing companies, often known as MLMs, are household names: Avon, Mary Kay, Pampered Chef and Amway. MLMs have annual sales of about $30 billion, with about 16 million people in the United States selling their products, according to the industry group Direct Selling Association, which represents these firms and others. The recent controversies might raise the question: What's the difference between a legitimate multilevel marketing company and an illegal pyramid scheme, in which only people who get in first -- at the top of the pyramid-like structure -- make money and everyone else is a dupe? The harshest critics maintain there is no difference, that there's no such thing as a legitimate MLM and that the industry's secrets stay safe because of a cultlike mentality and a blind eye of regulators. Jon M. Taylor, who was once a seller for an MLM company, said he has studied the industry for 18 years and analyzed more than 500 MLM companies. He maintains the website MLM-thetruth.com and offers a free e-book there. "I have not yet found a good MLM -- a good MLM is an oxymoron," Taylor said. He said all MLM companies have the same flaw: They depend on endless chains of recruiting new members. "There is no more unfair and deceptive practice than multilevel marketing," Taylor said. Tracy Coenen, a forensic accountant and fraud investigator with Sequence Inc. in Chicago and Milwaukee, is author of the Fraud Files Blog. She is also a critic. "Multilevel marketing companies are pyramid schemes that the government allows to operate," said Coenen. "The only difference is that Herbalife, or any multilevel marketing company, has a tangible product that they use to make their pyramid appear legitimate." The Direct Selling Association says MLMs are legitimate businesses, and that the group has about 200 members carefully screened by the organization to ensure they are not pyramid schemes and don't use deceptive practices. The Federal Trade Commission agrees there are legitimate MLMs. The difference between a legitimate business and pyramid scheme comes down to products. If the company and its distributors make money primarily from the sale of products to end-users (and not boxes of product accumulating in a distributor's garage), it's OK. By contrast, a pyramid scheme compensates those at the top of the pyramid with participation fees paid by those recruited at the bottom. It eventually collapses when the scheme can't recruit more people. But identifying a pyramid scheme can be difficult because MLMs typically have product sales, along with recruitment fees and recruitment incentives. "It gets cloudy when you have a situation where you have fees being paid for both," said Monica Vaca, assistant director of the FTC's division of marketing practices. "It's very nuanced." While prosecuting an MLM can seem somewhat of a judgment call, cases have a common factor: deceptive promises about how much money distributors will earn, Vaca said. In the Fortune Hi-Tech Marketing case filed last month, C. Steven Baker, director of the FTC's Midwest region, said, "These defendants were promising people that if they worked hard they could make lots of money. But it was a rigged game, and the vast majority of people lost money." Joe Mariano, president of the Direct Selling Association, said MLM companies typically use multilevel compensation as an alternative to traditional advertising. Companies use money they would otherwise spend on ads or shelf space to instead pay distributors. "Pyramids are bad guys," Mariano said. "Their mere existence confuses the marketplace and makes it more difficult for legitimate direct-selling companies to do business and to be understood." Key to the association's code of ethics, which members are expected to abide by, is a prohibition on deceptive sales practices, including promises of outsize earnings. Fortune Hi-Tech was not a member of the association, Mariano said. Indeed, it's often true that the vast majority of distributors don't earn near enough to make MLM selling their primary job. The Direct Selling Association puts median earnings at $2,400 per year, although critics say the vast majority earn nothing. Still, Mariano is quick to point out: "Somebody who works hard at this has the potential to do very, very well." Los Angeles-based Herbalife, a 32-year-old seller of weight-loss shakes and wellness products, became news in December when Bill Ackman, founder of Pershing Square Capital Management, made a $1 billion bet against Herbalife by shorting the stock. He has repeatedly called the company a pyramid scheme and gave a lengthy and public explanation of why. (Ackman's Dec. 20 presentation is available at factsaboutherbalife.com while Herbalife's Jan. 10 response is available at its website for investors, ir.herbalife.com In the Chicago area, Herbalife has a huge presence, with more than 16,000 distributors in the metropolitan region, about a quarter of whom are avid sellers or "leaders," according to the company. In an interview, Herbalife President Des Walsh said the company is not a pyramid scheme because it sells "real products to real people" and doesn't directly pay for recruiting new distributors. He points to the company being in existence for three decades, operating in 88 countries and continuing to grow. "That growth has been based on more customers consuming our products every single day around the world," he said. He said Ackman is "seeking to disseminate false and misleading information" about Herbalife to lower the stock price and profit from his bet against the company. Beneath the fray of high-finance skirmishes is Pablo Caicedo, 38, of Chicago, and his story is typical. He said he started using Herbalife products, lost 35 pounds and felt like he had more energy. He learned he could get a discount on the products he used by becoming an Herbalife distributor, which he did. He began selling to friends as well. After three months, he was making enough money to quit his job as a parking valet, he said. And for 14 years since, he's sold Herbalife products. He said the negative publicity around MLMs and Herbalife, in particular, doesn't bother him, chalking it up to other people's opinions. "There are always two sides to an issue," Caicedo said, adding that he has been satisfied with Herbalife. Caicedo said he wasn't comfortable disclosing how much money he earns annually from Herbalife sales. However successful Caicedo is financially with Herbalife, others aren't nearly so. In fact, 88 percent of Herbalife distributors earned no commissions in 2012, according to company numbers. That excludes potential profits distributors might have earned on sales of products to others, but it also excludes sales expenses distributors incur, figures Herbalife says it doesn't have. Why do so few make money? Herbalife says it's because 73 percent of its sales force only join as distributors to get a wholesale discount on products that they use themselves. For those people, paying the $59 or $109 to become Herbalife distributors, depending on the starter kit, is like paying a fee to join a Costco warehouse club to get better prices, Walsh said. The product discount for those distributors is 25 percent. But even the vast majority of those who are sales "leaders" at Herbalife, the top 20 percent of sellers, don't earn enough to live. Last year, more than half of the 82,464 sales leaders earned $1,000 or less in commissions for the whole year, according to Herbalife. Walsh said that's because most of them make Herbalife a part-time business, viewing profits as incremental income, perhaps to pay for a family vacation. "It's an additional form of part-time income that really can help significantly impact their lives," he said. However, like all MLMs, the very top sales people can profit handsomely. Of those who achieved the sales status of "leader," 0.7 percent make six-figure dollar amounts in commissions. And 194 distributors, 0.2 percent of leaders, had average gross payments from Herbalife of $724,030. Such earnings disparity is common in multilevel marketing. Often MLMs will suggest the difference in earnings stems from a difference in effort, that some sellers are more serious about the business than others. However, critics say high earners are part of a deception and contribute to the lottery mindset of sellers. Herbalife isn't the only company in the news. On Jan. 28, the suit by the FTC and several state attorneys general shut down Fortune Hi-Tech Marketing, a network marketer whose distributors sold products that included health and beauty goods and those from certain wireless providers. The company's distributors earned little for selling goods and services and made more signing up additional sales people, regulators allege. Most paid $100 to $300 in annual fees, and some paid additional money to be eligible for sales commissions and recruiting bonuses. Fortune officials could not be reached for comment. At a news conference in Lexington, Ky., the FTC's Baker reportedly declined to comment on whether the move against Fortune Hi-Tech means the agency is making a more aggressive push against direct marketers. gkarp@tribune.com ___ (c)2013 the Chicago Tribune Visit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.com Distributed by MCT Information Services

In the review, Broder (who's covered practically every subject for the Times since starting in the late '90s) tested the car's battery life, and found it wanting. The gist: Musk just went on CNBC and accused Broder of not having charged the battery all the way, going past the advisable speed limit and taking a detour in Manhattan. Broder started his trip in Washington. As he reached New Jersey he "noticed that the estimated range was falling faster than miles were accumulating": At 68 miles since recharging, the range had dropped by 85 miles, and a little mental math told me that reaching Milford would be a stretch. Eventually, the car's heater shut off and the dash ordered him to ìRecharge Now.î Before going on CNBC, Musk 'scritique came via Tweets. Of note is that the company says it has the data logs of the car, which forms the basis for the criticism of the review. Elon Musk/Twitter Courts tossed out a lawsuit Tesla filed against the BBC last year after the show Top Gear gave a similar review. Update:†The New York Times†responds: "The Times's February 10 article recounting a reporter's test drive in a Tesla Model S was completely factual, describing the trip in detail exactly as it occurred. Any suggestion that the account was "fake" is, of course, flatly untrue. "Our reporter followed the instructions he was given in multiple conversations with Tesla personnel. He described the entire drive in the story; there was no unreported detour. And he was never told to plug the car in overnight in cold weather, despite repeated contact with Tesla." Tesla's stock dived this morning, post-review, but has come back a bit. Yahoo SEE ALSO:†How The Most Ambitious Auto Venture In A Century Nearly Collapsed And Then Came Back From The Dead &gt;

One interesting chart shows how the the volatility index ó a measure of uncertainty in the stock markets ó recovered its crisis-related spikes. From Credit Suisse: In the Sourcebook, we identify 11 major spikes in the VIX, each associated with an economic or political crisis. For each crisis, Figure 10 shows the time taken in trading days for the VIX to revert from its peak volatility back to its (then) long-run mean. The longest reversion time was during the credit crunch/Lehman crisis, when it took 232 trading days (11 months). The average time was 106 trading days, or just under five months. Figure 10 also shows the ìhalf-life,î or the time taken to revert half the way back to the mean. The average half-life was just 11 days. Credit Suisse

Now that a tax deal has been made, and munis are still tax exemptóeven though they pay a lower yield than corporate bondsóthey appear to be more attractive than their yield would signal. "Regardless of your strategy, when it comes to evaluating a municipal bondís value, remember to use tax equivalent yield to put it on equal footing with taxable securities," said Tucker in a note.

Here's a metric we've been following with interest for the last several weeks. It's earnings growth expectations, which have been falling on a weekly basis. Earnings and earnings expectations are arguably the most important drivers of the stock market. "Since the end of the fourth quarter (December 31), analysts have also reduced earnings growth expectations for Q1 2013 (to 0.1% from 2.4%) and Q2 2013 (to 5.1% from 6.7%)," wrote FactSet's John Butters in a note published on Friday. "For Q1 2013, all ten sectors have witnessed a decline in estimated earnings growth, led by the Materials (to 2.1% from 7.2%) and Information Technology (to -2.7% from 1.7%) sectors." Just last week, the growth expectations 0.5% for Q1 and 5.4% for Q2. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 ended last week at a fresh post-crisis high. When stocks go up while earnings come down, valuations are rising in a phenomenon called multiples expansion.† In other words, stocks are getting more expensive. Some stock market bulls argue that valuations should justifiably be higher. But the bears will warn that eventually, these cracks in earnings expectations will catch up to the market and manifest in a sell-off. Here's the chart from Factset: FactSet Here's a chart from Goldman Sachs showing how full-year earnings growth expectations have been coming down: Goldman Sachs

Janet Yellen Vice-Chair of the San Francisco Federal Reserve has a big new speech out about how slow this recovery has been, and why. One of the culprits for the slower recovery? Fiscal policy. Specifically? Were not spending enough. Government spending, which usually provides a boost to the economy in the quarters following the recession, has been a net drag this time because the government is spending less than it normally does. As this chart shows, in the initial 4 quarters since the start of ths recovery, government spending provided its standard boost to GDP. But in the 8 quarter and 12 quarter period after that, fiscal policy has been a drag, as spending growth has been a lot slower than in past recoveries. So yes, spending is the problem. We just need to crank it up. Janet Yellen, Federal Reserve

Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Prime Minister of the UAE and ruler of Dubai, told reporters Monday that Dubai was ready to take "carry on" with its plans and take risks to reach its "ultimate goal." "Impossible is not in the UAE's dictionary,‚Äù Al Maktoum said, according to Arabian Business. When asked why Dubai always had to be number one, he replied. "We should always be number one because nobody remembers number two." Those plans to be "number one" are already becoming apparent. Dubai announced earlier this year that it is planning to build the world's largest mall. There are also new plans for a replica of India‚Äôs Taj Mahal ‚Äî which would be the same except four times bigger than the original. The renewed investment seems to be making a difference. Peter Bill of the London Evening Standard reports that home prices are rising fast enough that the government is trying to restrict mortgages to half a property‚Äôs value, and hotel-room completions are expected to triple this year as tourism returns.¬†
WATCH: Here's How To Track Your Credit ScoreBusiness Insider		    See Also	     																				  											JOHN MCAFEE: I'll decrypt the San Bernardino phone free of charge so Apple doesn't need to place a back door on its product																													  											'The Ultra Rich Asian Girls of Vancouver' help explain why China has a unique 1% problem																													  											Here's what popular dog breeds looked like before and after 100 years of breeding													    	The Federal Trade Commission just released a report on the credit reporting industry that could spell trouble for tens of millions of consumers.¬† When the agency reviewed 1,000 consumers' credit reports, it found 25 percent of people had at least one error that could negatively impact their credit score. And once the errors were disputed, one in ten consumers saw their FICO scores increase, including five percent who had a 25-point bump.¬† This is a huge deal.¬† Two other major reports on credit reporting accuracy have offered completely different pictures in the past. The first, conducted by the U.S. Public Interest Research Group in¬†2004, estimated close to 80 percent of reports are erroneous in some way. And in 2011, the Policy and Economic Research Council answered with a report that found less than 1 percent of consumers had potentially damning errors on their reports.¬† The FTC's report is the latest of five in a decade-long study of the credit reporting industry, and could be the best analysis available to date.¬† ‚ÄúThese are eye-opening numbers for American consumers,‚Äù Howard Shelanski, Director of the¬†FTC‚Äôs Bureau of Economics, said in a statement Monday. ‚ÄúThe results of this first-of-its-kind study [making] it clear that consumers should check their credit reports regularly. ¬†If they don‚Äôt, they are potentially putting their pocketbooks at risk." With the new findings, the FTC estimates between 10 and 21 percent of consumers have inaccurate credit reports ‚Äì‚Äì that means between 20 million and 42 million consumers are toting around reports that make them look riskier to lenders than they actually are. Slice and dice the numbers however you want (the Consumer Data Industry Association put a positive spin on things), but there's no getting around the fact that even seemingly small errors can pose problems for consumers. "The problem is that if I have a credit score of 619, and I report an error and it goes up to 620, then that one point was meaningful," John Ulzheimer, CEO of¬†Smartcredit.com, told BI. "Most lenders have these prefixed score tiers ... and if you're not at that score or higher, you don't get [competitive interest rates]." And considering the fact that errors are likely to appear on reports pulled from all three major credit reporting agencies, the problem could be three-fold.¬† Boston University Prof.¬†Michael Salinger, a former director of the Federal Trade Commission‚Äôs Bureau of Economics, reached out to BI to say consumers should take the report as a call to action. ‚ÄúMost people do not realize how many prices are affected by their credit scores.¬† Even what you pay for car insurance depends on it," he said. " The FTC report seems to suggest that the rate of serious error is only about 5%, but that is enough to make it worth checking whether the information the credit reporting agencies have on you is correct." Easy to spot, difficult to fix Finding the errors is the easy part. Anyone can check their credit report for free from all three credit bureaus at¬†annualcreditreport.com. It's getting a reporting agency to fix the issue that can be tricky, as we saw played out in this eye-opening report by CBS's Steve Kroft. In the FTC study, the most common errors involved information furnished by credit lenders (13.8 percent) and debt collectors (7.5 percent). Even so, it's up to the consumer to file a dispute with their credit agency in order to get the problem fixed. Once you've gotten the CRA involved (either Transunion, Equifax or Experian), it is under federal obligation to see that the issue is addressed. And if the error is repeated at all three agencies, you have to file disputes individually with each one.¬† The good news is that once these errors are disputed and corrected, consumers should see an immediate impact on their credit score.¬†About 8 million credit report disputes are filed each year, which seems paltry considering the FTC's findings.¬† "Clearly, you want to have accuracy on a credit report," Ulzheimer said. "Even if it's a cosmetic error, like an incorrect address or your employment information is outdated ... consumers have a right to a correct credit report across the board."
The January expiration of the payroll tax cut has yet to have a noticeable impact on spending, according to a new report by High Frequency Economics' chief U.S. economist Jim O'Sullivan. From his latest note: "...despite the payroll tax hike on January 1, retail sales appear to have been resilient. A gain in non-auto, non-gasoline retail sales in this weekís report for January is being signaled by company data, with the caveat that the number of companies that publicly report results on a monthly basis has been declining. The Bloomberg aggregation of same-store sales data accelerated to up 5.1% year-over-year in January from 4.4% in December. Moreover, retail sales were strong in January 2012, with the ìcontrolî measure in the retail sales report up 1.0% month-over- month. That makes the acceleration on a year-over-year basis even more impressive." Here's his chart: High Frequency Economics O'Sullivan warns, however, that when the payroll tax cut went into effect two years ago, the impact on spending was not immediately obvious and appeared in the data on a lag. However, there are a number of positive trends that should help offset the impact of the tax. "[P]art of the pattern likely also reflects the spending power being generated by an increasingly healthy labor market recovery," writes O'Sullivan. High Frequency Economics In addition, the people who're seeing a higher dollar value being cut from their salaries are the ones that have high salaries to begin with, according to O'Sullivan, and such upper-income people tend to be cushioned from the impact of a higher tax bill. From the report: "We do not believe the acceleration of bonus income and dividends from 2013 into late 2012 to escape higher taxes has had any significant impact on the spending data. Most recipients of that income were likely upper-income individuals with high saving rates, who do not live paycheck to paycheck." Still, this doesn't mean we're in the clear. "With the tax reducing disposable income by 0.9%óequivalent to 0.7% of GDPóand many individuals living paycheck to paycheck, there clearly will be an impact on growth," he writes.
Why the move? Andrus is joining Solamere Capital, a private investment firm that has close connections to the Romney clan, Tom Gara at The Wall Street Journal reported. The firm's founders are Mitt Romney's son Tagg and Spencer Zwick, who was the finance chair of Mitt Romney's presidential campaign. Mitt himself initially seeded the firm with $10 million. Andrus himself has close ties to the Romneys. He supported Mitt in his presidential bid, and his father, Brent, roomed with Mitt in France when they were Mormon missionaries, according to USA Today. ìIím very familiar with them as a family, and with Mittís accomplishments in business,î Andrus told The WSJ. "Jeremy has demonstrated a remarkable ability to lead the growth of a small business into a large, highly-profitable company," said Tagg in a statement. "We plan to partner with the objective of finding private investments that fit his operating background and talents." What exactly does Solamere do? "Unlike most private equity firms dedicated to analyzing and buying companies, Solamere specializes in something else: billing itself as a 'fund of funds' with 'unparalleled networks,' it provides investors with 'unique access' to an elite set of other private equity firms and hedge funds," explained Lee Fang at The Nation. At Solamere, Andrus will be "entrepreneur in residence" and will help "find and manage investment opportunities" as the firm looks for small businesses ($5-$25 million in earnings) to invest in, according to the WSJ. As for Skullcandy, founder and former CEO Rick Alden temporarily will look after the company until a permanent successor can be found.†Andrus will stay on as a a consultant for the next year.

FlickrOver the past several days, Speaker John Boehner has tried to tie sequestration ‚Äî the series of mandatory, across-the-board spending cuts¬† ‚Äî to the President as opposition grows toward the coming austerity. On February 5, Boehner's office released a statement on "the President's Sequester." The president‚Äôs sequester should be replaced with spending cuts and reforms that will start us on the path to balancing the budget in 10 years. On Friday, the Speaker attempted to coin the phrase "Obamaquester" to tie the series of mandatory cuts to the President. Boehner changed his Twitter profile picture to a section of Bob Woodward's book detailing how the President initially proposed the sequester to satisfy the GOP need for cuts.¬† The Speaker even proposed the cumbersome hashtag "#Obamaquester" to push the narrative. This is rather strange, given the Speaker's initial pride in the accomplishment of guaranteed spending cuts. Recalling the negotiations of 2011, initially the President desired a clean increase in the debt ceiling ‚Äî as preceding Presidents had recieved with little fight ‚Äî and Boehner's GOP wanted cuts.¬† After the negotiation guaranteed $1.4 trillion of deficit reduction in exchange for a debt ceiling increase, Boehner was very pleased. In an interview with CBS' Scott Pelley from August 2011, Boehner conveys that he was very pleased with the result of the negotiation:¬† Boehner:¬†When you look at this final agreement that we came to with the White House, I got 98 percent of what I wanted. I'm pretty happy. That's a far cry from blaming the Obama administration for devastating cuts. Here's the full video of the interview:¬† \ UPDATE 2:30 PM: Brandon Buck, the Press Secretary for Speaker John Boehner, has pushed back on White House Press Secretary Jay Carney linking this quote with the sequester. The gist is that Boehner originally came to an agreement with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell on a plan, and that this plan was scrapped for the eventual Budget Control Act which contained the sequestration clause.¬† Essentially, the 2 percent that Boehner didn't want was the sequestration: Yes, the bipartisan Budget Control Act as originally conceived by Speaker Boehner, Senator Reid, and Senator McConnell did not include the sequester. The one change to the original deal was the inclusion of this trigger mechanism ‚Äì so that the President would not have to deal with the debt limit again before his re-election campaign. It was only at the White House‚Äôs insistence that we now have what is popularly known as the Obamaquester. It‚Äôs a fact. ¬†
Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann just weighed in on the euro exchange rate during a speech in Germany, in which he said that the currency is not seriously overvalued. Following his comments, the euro jumped 50 pips against the U.S. dollar from a level around 1.3375 to around 1.3425. Right now, the EUR/USD exchange rate is up 0.4 percent on the session: FINVIZ Weidmann also said that currency devaluation hasn't historically helped economic competitiveness, and that if many countries try to depress their currencies at the same time, those efforts can only end in failure. The jump isn't huge, but it highlights the market's ongoing sensitivity to the continued trickle of opinions on the euro exchange rate, especially those from central bankers in the currency bloc.
Perhaps thatís true. But is the partyís urgent political problem that voters think the party squishy on spending? After all, exit polls had Mitt Romney edging President Obama on who would do a better job cutting the deficit. The public also, for now, seems to prefer cutting debt through a combination of tax increases and spending cuts. In addition, polls show the debt issue is a distant second to economic growth and job creation. Republicans have been unsuccessful in connecting Americaís historically high debts and deficits to the problemís Americans face in their everyday lives. The economic case here is even sketchier. First of all, balancing the budget in a decade will be difficult. The recent Congressional Budget forecast ó which includes the sequester ó places the 2023 deficit at $978 billion, or 3.8% of GDP. How to close that trillion-dollar gap? Discretionary spending in 2023 will be 30% below the average for the past century, which leaves entitlement cuts a better target. But following that path would mean, for instance, changing Medicare benefits for current† and near-term recipients, not just for younger Americans. Thatís a good idea but one that Republicans have been loathe to embrace. Another option is assuming faster economic growth through tax reform and deregulation, but Democrats and many budget experts would probably cry foul. Even if Republicans can cook up a reasonable plan to balance the budget in a decade, is that a public policy worth doing and spending political capital? The key measure of fiscal health is a nationís debt-to-GDP ratio. And you can lower that ratio without actually balancing the budget or running a surplus. Rep. Paul Ryanís original ìRoadmapî plan lowered debt-to-GDP by 30 points over two decades without a single year in the black. And that was assuming slow-growth CBO forecasts. A reasonable policy goal would be to get the debt-GDP ratio off the stabilization path and onto a downward trajectory toward a sub-40% level ó from over 70% currently ó over the next two decades. (From 1957 to 2007, the Tax Policy Center notes, the the debt ratio did not exceed 50% and averaged just 37% of GDP.) And ASAP entitlement reform must be part of that effort. The BB-10 effort also distracts from the more important goal of constructing a broad portfolio of ideas ó taxes, immigration, public investment, consumer-driven healthcare ó that would increase economic growth, broadly raise incomes, and help solve real-world problems in the lives of average Americans. Majority Leader Erick Cantorís recent speech at AEI was a good start. Expanding up it would be both smart politics and policy.
 Visit NBCNews.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy "Morning Joe" host Joe Scarborough slammed House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi on Monday, calling her comments on the nation's spending priorities "breathtaking" and "out of touch." On "Fox News Sunday," Pelosi told host Chris Wallace that†it was "almost a false argument to say we have a spending problem. We have a budget deficit problem that we have to address." Her comments came in anticipation of the across-the-board cuts scheduled to kick in March 1 as a result of the sequester. Pelosi advocated a deal that would combine mix of spending cuts and revenue increases to close the nation's budget deficit, saying cuts to education and other targeted domestic programs of the sequester wouldn't spur growth. "When Nancy Pelosi says, 'We don't have a spending problem,' Americans say, 'She's out of touch,'" Scarborough said. "When Nancy Pelosi says, 'The problem with Medicare is Medicare,' Americans say, 'She's out of touch.'" Scarborough said that the only possible reason Pelosi made these comments is that the Democratic Party has "convinced itself" that it does not have a spending problem. He compared it to the "radical wing" of the Republican Party convincing itself of "all the things that lost them the election" last November. "Democrats are about to step into a real mess if they're not careful," Scarborough said. "I've been saying the past four years saying the Republican Party is out of touch, and they're going to lose the presidential election because of it.  "And I was right, Republicans! Now, let me say to Democrats: You're out of touch. You've got a spending problem." Scarborough has railed in recent weeks about the budget deficit, something for which he has taken a substantial amount of criticism. The Washington Post's Neil Irwin summarizes much of the argument against Scarborough†ó he's citing people who are not exactly mainstream economists and who are in the proverbial "Beltway loop" of Washington.

Flickr / orphanjonesWSJ's Stephen Bernard has a fascinating report in today's paper about retail traders financing their currency trading with¬†credit cards. The practice has become worrying enough to warrant attention from the National Futures association, which will discuss a ban on using credit cards to fund trading accounts on Wednesday. Bernard spoke with a salesman in Tennessee using credit cards to fund currency trades: One investor is Carl Young, a wireless-communications salesman in Knoxville, Tenn. Mr. Young recently used a credit card to fund his accounts with FXDD and¬†Gain Capital Holdings¬†Inc.'s¬†Forex.com, when he was expecting a big paycheck from his work. He said he would probably trade less if he couldn't use credit cards. "If I know I have [money] coming to me next month, guaranteed, I want to use it now," Mr. Young said. He said he made profits from the trades he completed before receiving his paycheck, then paid off the credit card in full. "It's a convenience." It's hard to determine how much retail trading is being funded on cards, but Bernard says according to industry experts, a card ban could cause some retail forex brokerages to close completely and would likely mean "millions of dollars less flowing to customer accounts in the U.S." Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale FX strategist Sebastien Galy recently opined that a good portion of the hidden leverage in the system is now concentrated at the retail investor level, though he was referring to fixed income markets. This seems like a pretty wild example of the retail investor levering up, especially given the typically volatile nature of currency trading. However, it may not be that uncommon, and certainly doesn't seem like anything new. Hedge fund manager John Burbank got his start doing the same thing in the 1990s.

Here‚Äôs a hint for anyone who follows financial news but who has never worked in the industry: Markets never move in response to a rating agency change. Never. Ever. Markets move in anticipation of news, months or weeks ahead of a change in credit quality.¬† Often the ratings agencies observe a market move which prompts a query on their part, and possibly the rating agencies often have an inkling of the change in credit quality on their own. But the ratings agency review process itself also takes days or weeks.¬† Which, in the continuous feedback loop of world markets, may itself prompt a market response. Markets are forward-looking, anticipating credit quality changes, as well as ratings agency changes.¬† Markets never respond to credit ratings changes.

The banking giant is to come under the spotlight on Monday over allegations it misled shareholders over the source of funds which averted its need for a bailout at the height of the financial crisis. Barclays is accused of obscuring the true source of a £3bn investment received in 2008, which the BBC's Panorama alleges came from the Abu Dhabi government rather than Manchester City owner Sheikh Mansour, as the bank had claimed. The investigation, which will be broadcast on Monday evening, allegedly found that although Barclays was aware the source of funds could change in the run up to a shareholder vote on the deal, that the lender refrained from informing stakeholders until after the transaction was approved. Even then, disclosure was "buried in the small print", according to Panorama investigators, and used misleading language referring to "his investment". Although Sheikh Mansour chairs the Abu Dhabi government investment vehicle that provided the funding, International Petroleum Investment Company (IPIC), it is not believed the Emerati royal invested any of his own money in the bank at the time. Jeremy Carver, a lawyer for Transparency International, told the BBC Barclays may be at fault if government officials benefited from the deal. The bank told the BBC the mistake was "simply a drafting error" and insisted information given to shareholders following the vote was "entirely appropriate in all the circumstances." "Immediately following receipt and verification of that information we made overnight amendments to the relevant disclosures relating to the investors in the prospectus documents," said Barclays in a statement. It added: "The change in ownership of the investing companies had no bearing on the transaction or required approvals." Barclays avoided nationalisation in 2008 when investors from Abu Dhabi and Qatar agreed to inject £7bn in exchange for a 32pc stake in the bank, a move which the lender said at the time prevented it sinking into a "death spiral ." 
Early last week one of my colleagues at¬†Advisor Perspectives¬†asked about the correlation between GDP and Defense spending. I pondered the question over the weekend, which also prompted me to think about defense spending in general and how it has changed over the years. For openers, here is a chart based on data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) showing nominal National Defense Consumption Expenditures &amp; Gross Investment, a quarterly data series that is a subcomponent of GDP stretching back to 1947 (FRED series¬†FDEFX). ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Doug Short At first blush the growth in spending since the turn of the century looks astonishing, and of course the government's response to 9/11 with wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were largely responsible for this surge. But let's make two changes -- one to the data itself and the other to the way its depicted. The next chart is adjusted for inflation using the¬†GDP deflator¬†but chained in Q4 2012 dollars. Also, I've changed the vertical axis to a log scale to give an accurate visualization of the relative change in spending over time. Doug Short¬† It doesn't take much knowledge of history to recognize some key features in the chart: There was amazing surge in spending associated with the Korean War (1950-1953) that was trimmed after the war ended and leveled out for a decade. The increase that began in 1965 is a fingerprint of the Vietnam War. It peaked in Q2 1968 and gradually declined to pre-Viet Nam War levels by 1975. The Iran Hostage Crisis (1979‚Äì1981) and the Reagan years saw steady rise in defense spending to an interim peak in Q3 1987. The decline that followed took us to a trough in Q1 1998 that was comparable to the spending levels during the Viet Nam War spending peak. Then the attack on the Trade Towers and its aftermath triggered another cycle of spending that peaked in Q3 2010. It is interesting to note that the government's calculations of quarterly GDP dates from the second year of the Baby Boom. How have these cycles of defense spending correlated to the overall US economy during these 65+ years? Here is a look at National Defense Consumption Expenditures &amp; Gross Investment as a percent of GDP. The Advance Estimate of Q4 2012 GDP puts defense spending at 5.0% of GDP. The interim peak was 5.7% in Q3 2007. The historic low in this data series was Q4 2000 at 3.7%. Doug Short¬† All of the charts above have recessions highlighted. A quick glance confirms what we might expect -- that defense spending is impervious to recessions. In fact, the spending by the Department of Defense has been a reliable source of economic stimulus during recessionary periods. Which brings me to the topic of sequestration and defense spending. This is a politically supercharged topic that I'm reluctant to debate. But I would point out that the latest¬†OMB report¬†(PDF file) on the subject explains that sequestration would cut the discretionary defense budget by $54.667 billion annually. The OMB reports that the overall defense budget for 2013 is $672.88 billion of which $525.4 billion is discretionary. Thus, sequestration would trim about 8.3% off the overall Pentagon budget. That is indeed substantial. Discretionary defense budget cuts of this magnitude will have a significant impact on GDP far beyond the¬†government consumption expenditures and gross investment¬† subcomponent. The military spending cuts will have a ripple effect on¬†gross private domestic investment¬†and will trim the personal income that drives the largest component of GDP,¬†personal consumption expenditures. If sequestration indeed happens, as increasingly looks to be the case, the US economy will be in for an economic struggle that will greatly increase our risk of a recession.
AP Photo/Riccardo De LucaPope Benedict's resignation today has left many shocked, but with the news beginning to settle in, people are now beginning to wonder what his legacy will be. Generally seen as a conservative who didn't favor reform, Benedict also has another dubious distinction ‚Äî his watch coincided with a scandal that involved allegations of financial corruption, media leaks from the Pope's own butler, and even reports of links with the mafia. The scandal, which broke last year, is one of the most serious problems the church has faced in decades and seemed to reveal a wide schism within the clergy. The story began with a series of mysterious leaked letters which eventually became informally known as "VatiLeaks". Journalist Gianlugi Nuzzi, notorious for a series of books about the Vatican, was reportedly vetted for months before being given documents by an unknown source, known only as "Maria", the Daily Beast reports. Nuzzi began revealing the information in the documents in his TV show The Untouchables in 2011, before publishing full details in a book last year, Sua Santit√†‚ÄîLe Carte Segrete di Benedetto XVI. The documents themselves were 30 faxed memos from the Pope's office to other Vatican offices. While many were mundane, some appeared to show that Vatican insiders who attempted to confront corruption in the Vatican Bank had been sidelined. For example, during Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano's tenure as deputy-governor of the Vatican city from 2009-2011,¬†Vigano encountered and reportedly tried to put a stop to corruption, cronyism, nepotism, and the awarding of contracts to friends of officials at inflated prices. However,¬†he was removed from office¬†shortly after bringin¬†evidence of these events to the attention of Pope Benedict XVI. The "Vaitleaks" scandal brought a renewed round of scrutiny in the church to the Italian press. There were reports that Magliana mob boss Enrico De Pedis had been buried alongside the bodies of former Popes and Cardinals following his death in 1990 ‚Äî all for the lump sum of 1 billion lire ($660,000). The stories about Pedis had circulated for years, but one new note leaked from the Vatican press office suggested that Pedis may have played a role in the disappearance of a Vatican employees 15-year-old daughter. Another scandal involving Father Ninni Treppiedi and¬†Sicilian mafioso Matteo Messina Denaro broke later, with reports that millions of Denaro's euros had been laundered through Treppiedi's former parish Aclamo, the¬†richest¬†parish in Sicily. Denaro is still at large and is considered by many as the most wanted man in Italy. "VatiLeaks" became a major headache for the church, with the Vatican's secretary of state, Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, insisting it's just the result of journalists "pretending to be Dan Brown" and, more cryptically, the "devil". In May 2012 Vatican authorities finally arrested one man thought to be behind the leaks ‚Äî the Pope's butler, Paolo Gabriele. Gabriele was found guilty by a Vatican court in October, and was sentenced to 18 months in jail. The butler was later pardoned by Benedict himself,¬†however, and he is now reportedly working in a hospital. While the arrest was to the delight of headline writers around the world, there's a significant amount of people who don't buy it. The theory is that Gabriele could never had access to some of the documents, and others must have been behind the leak. Journalist Nuzzi has refused to say anything about the person who gave him the Vatileaks documents. Regardless, the leaks appear to have prompted official reactions from other entities. For the first time ever, the International Narcotics Control Strategy Report said the Vatican city as an area "of concern" when it comes to money laundering, and the Milan branch of JPMorgan Chase closed the Vatican bank account at the end of March 2012, citing a lack of transparency and insufficient information concerning money transfers. During the height of the scandal, one letter sent to the highest Vatican officials warned of a potential plot to kill Benedict XVI. Curiously, Nuzzi himself has told Der Spiegel that the target of the leaks isn't the pope himself, instead arguing that Benedict XVI was revolutionary, and clearly wanted to bring transparency to the Vatican bank. What the leaks really show, he said, is his weakness of his leadership. Many note that the target of attacks seems to be the second most important person in the Vatican ‚Äî the secretary of state, Tarcisio Bertone, who has been accused of cronyism and refusing to deal with corruption, Reuters reports. Bertone is of course the man who would like to blame the scandal on "the devil", but he's also the head of the opaque and archaic Vatican bureaucracy, the Curia, which is dominated by Italian clerics such as Bertone and can effectively overrule the pope. Benedict XVI had planned to reform the church, but instead found himself under its power, despite a growing backlash. Whatever the reason behind the leaks, the scandal has shown the incredible level of infighting inside the secretive headquarters of the Catholic Church. It may well be something to keep an eye on as the Church begins its search for a new pope.
Average daily trading volume in the S&amp;P 500 index has fallen every year since the crisis, and in 2013, it's now at levels not seen in 15 years. You have to go all the way back to 1998 to observe lower trading volumes in the index: Bloomberg, Goldman Sachs Options Research On the other hand, the use of options to trade the S&amp;P 500 has taken off over the past ten years, and in 2013, it's near all-time highs. Average daily S&amp;P 500 options volume so far this year is up 10 percent from that in 2012: OptionMetrics, Goldman Sachs Options Research With more and more investors expressing their views on stocks via options as opposed to trading in actual shares, it's interesting to take a look at how S&amp;P 500 options traders are positioned. A "put option" constitutes a bet that stocks will go down whereas a "call option" is a bet that stocks will go up. The put-call ratio, then, is the ratio of options traders betting against the index to those betting on it. That ratio has decreased in 2013 from 2012 and is now approaching lows not seen since 2003: OptionMetrics, Goldman Sachs Options Research The lower put-call ratio may reflect the incredibly bullish sentiment we've seen toward stocks so far in 2013. At the same time, though, trading volume in the VIX options market ñ which puts a price to S&amp;P 500 volatility ñ is at an all-time high already in 2013. Goldman Sachs options strategists Krag Gregory and Jose Gonzalo Rangel have the details: The pace in 2013 has been even more remarkable for VIX options where the year-to-date average daily volume is running at a record high of 614,658 contracts ñ that is 1.4x the 2012 average and 22.4x the 2006 average. VIX options had a record setting January: A breakdown of average daily volume by calendar month shows that VIX option average daily volume recorded an all-time high in January 2013 while S&amp;P 500 options were in their 90th percentile relative to a 10-year history. The put-call ratio on VIX options has risen notably over the past month, suggesting that perhaps investors are upping their bets against a rise in volatility.
Flickr / dkshots On March 1, a large jolt of spending cuts will automatically take place, unless leaders in Washington find an alternative. Nobody thinks the spending cuts are a good policy, but the GOP might insist on them anyway, out of a feeling that they represent the only opportunity to get cuts. Potomac Research Group has done a survey of 1000 financial industry pros, managers of pension funds, hedge funds, and money market funds, asking them what they believe will happen.

Maureen lunn/Flickr,CCA new report on home prices has just been released by the National Association of Realtors. According to the report home prices rose in 133 of 152 U.S. metro areas in Q4. The national median existing single-family home price was $178,900, up 10.0 percent year-over-year.¬† This is the strongest year-over-year jump since Q4 2005. "Home sales are on a sustained uptrend, mortgage interest rates are hovering near record lows and unsold inventory is at the lowest level in 12 years," said the NAR's Lawrence Yun. "Home sales are being fueled by a pent-up demand and job creation, along with still favorable affordability conditions and rents rising at faster rates. Our population has been growing faster than overall housing stock, so supply and demand dynamics are very much at play." Read more at Realtor.org.
CNBC"Morituri te salutant"Of all of the Chinese Zodiac years, the year of the snake has historically been the worst. In his latest note, UBS's Art Cashin goes through some of the bad ones. Will The January Effect Get Swallowed By The Snake? ñ The ever-alert Jim Brown, over at Option Investor, notes that the year of the snake is historically the least bullish of the twelve signs in the Asian zodiac.† The prior snake (2001) saw a loss of 13.1% after losing 28% at one point.† In the snake before that (1989), the S&amp;P did manage a gain of 9.7%, while 1977 saw a loss of 17.5%.† Rick Weissman of Gleacher and Company cited the rather spotty event record for past years of the snake.† We saw things like 9/11 (2001), the attack on Pearl Harbor (1941) and the stock market crash (1929).† Super Bowl and January are on the bull's side, while the snake threatens on behalf of the bears. A lot of years we wish we could forget.
Wikimedia CommonsAt this point, most are familiar with the new Japanese government's efforts to talk down the value of the Japanese yen in a bid to increase export competitiveness. One of the side-effects of a weaker yen is higher stock prices, and the Japanese Nikkei has been on a tear since September as the exchange rate has weakened. Now, it appears that the Japanese government is trying to talk up stock prices in the same way it's talking down the yen. Take a look at what Japan's economy minister Akira Amari said on Saturday, via The Japan Times: ‚ÄúIt will be important to show our mettle and see the Nikkei reach the 13,000 mark by the end of the fiscal year (March 31),‚Äù Amari said in a speech...‚ÄúWe want to continue taking (new) steps to help stock prices rise‚Äù further, Amari stressed, referring to the core policies of the Liberal Democratic Party administration ‚Äî the promotion of bold monetary easing, fiscal spending and greater private sector investment. The 13,000 index target implies around 17 percent upside in February and March. The pace may sound ambitious, but then again, Japan is one of the hottest momentum trades in the world right now. We won't get to see the market's response until tomorrow ‚Äì the Tokyo Stock Exchange was closed Monday for a holiday.
Thanks to steak Mecca Peter Luger, Manhattanites have become used to the idea of making the trip across the bridge to Brooklyn to get an amazing cut of steak. The cut is expected to be from the highest quality steer, perfectly seasoned, and grilled to a juicy medium-rare that could give a life-long vegetarian night terrors. Again, this perfection is what is expected. Perfection is also expected to be expensive ‚Äî a cut for two at Peter Luger will run you $72. That's why trusted restaurant reviewer New York Magazine shocked the city by naming the $15 steak at Brooklyn's St. Anselm the "Best Steak" in NYC. It was a bold move, and naturally merited serious consideration. Luckily, when it comes to steak, we all consider with our mouths. Getting even a Sunday night table at St. Anselm takes some planning and/or patience. At 6:30 p.m. the cozy Williamsburg restaurant was packed with happy customers. The smell was, in a word, irresistible. When the hostess said we would have to wait for an hour and a half for a table for two, you can imagine the disappointment. That said, it was all worth it. In 40 minutes we were beckoned back to the restaurant and seated at the bar. In 48 minutes we were sipping on a delicious (and reasonably priced at $28) red, waiting anxiously for two hanger steaks called the "Butchers Steak" on the menu. Now, understand that this steak does not come with sides. You must order them ‚Äî not only because they don't come with your meat, but because they are simply spectacular. The creamed spinach ($6) was not like your grandmother's ‚Äî more cheesiness, more spinanchiness, less goopy cream. The mashed potatoes ($6) were pan-fried, which gave them a crusty top, and cooked in truffle oil. "Truffle oil" should say everything there is to say about how great this is. "Crusty top" should say it twice. The Butchers Steak itself was completely worth the wait. It was grilled masterfully, beyond juicy etc. ‚Äî but that's just technical. What really stood out with this particular hanger cut was the taste. The steak was packed with flavor ‚Äî the kind of flavor that takes hours of thought for a chef to put together (or at least, seems like it) and stays with customers for days. It's the kind of flavor you obsess over, the kind you tell your friends about. Case in point: At another table one customer was explaining to his waiter and the rest of his party of four that he eats at St. Anselm multiple times a week. He is probably a very happy man.
Bloomberg via YouTubeThere's nothing like a good snow storm to mess up your economics forecasts. With snowstorm Nemo having torn through the Northeastern U.S., Deutsche Bank's Joe LaVorgna is now finding himself slashing his jobs February jobs forecast: ...This is the survey week for February nonfarm payroll employment so we are concerned the next batch of jobs data could be adversely affected by inclement winter weather. The Bureau of Labor Statistics provides data on the number of people who could not report to work because of bad weatherówe have dubbed this series ìweather workersî, and the top five months for weather workers are the following: January 1996 (1846k), January 1977 (1100k), January 1982 (1079k), February 2010 (1031k) and January 1978 (843k). Using initially reported nonfarm payroll figures, the average reading for these five months is +2k, although the economy was in recession in January 1982 when payrolls were down -231k. If we exclude this observation, then the average gain is 62k, better but still obviously very weak. In light of the possibility that February nonfarm payrolls are adversely distorted by weather, we are estimating only a +125k increase, down from a trailing three-month moving average of +200k. However, if jobless claims trend lower during the employment survey week and other measures of employment such as the ISM and ADP surveys show further improvement, then we will obviously adjust our forecast accordingly. Moreover, the level of January employment is likely to be revised higher, as this has occurred in four out of the last five years. Incidentally, the survey for the unemployment rate is conducted one week later, so there should not be a noticeable impact on the rate, which we expect to edge down one-tenth to 7.8%. Of course it's still way too early to make any conclusions since the month isn't even halfway over.† But for now, he's looking for just +125k. Ouch.
Unclear exactly what did it, but gold got slammed this morning. Unclear what's up. Kitco
Maps are powerful ideas. A map once drawn can be viewed as a contract, a promise to build something. We live with the¬†ghosts of maps¬†drawn long ago. Unbuilt highways queue-up to get built, even when their rationale has disappeared. But lines remain unbuilt for a reason, people perceived the benefit did not outweigh the cost. Of course, conditions can change, a line which once failed a benefit-cost test may now pass it, or vice versa. High-speed rail advocates have long assembled maps of proposed routes. I have a collection of them¬†here. These all present different visions of the future, and they can't all come to pass. But does that mean none of them should? A private firm would build high-speed rail if the expected profits exceeded the expected costs. Clearly that is not generally the case in the United States, otherwise we would see more evidence of this. There are certainly proposals, some farther along than others. The most likely right now appears to be the¬†All Aboard Florida project. I hope it succeeds. The public sector remains uninterested in profit, but instead should favor the more ambiguous general welfare. High-speed rail makes sense when the full economic benefits outweigh the full economic costs. The potential benefits include time savings for travelers, increased reliability, improved quality of service, reduced congestion on roadways and at airports, reduced pollution from automobiles and airplanes, and more economic activity as a result of the improved accessibility. The potential costs are those of constructing the system, operating it, the pollution costs associated with construction and operations, and so on. The¬†evidence¬†is that the capital costs of the new system do not outweigh potential reductions in pollution. The first map nicely draws with bright colors a possible United States High Speed Rail System. Alfred Twu The second map, from¬†Streets.mn¬†blogger Mike Hicks, shows actual Amtrak ridership today. Mike Hicks/Streets.mn Actual ridership is highest in the Northeast corridor, where the Acela service, along with other conventional passenger rail runs today. The other big Amtrak markets are between San Diego and Los Angeles, between Sacramento and the San Francisco Bay area, between Seattle and Portland, and between Chicago and a variety of midwestern cities, in particular St. Louis. Corridors that get traffic now with relatively slow service are more likely to get higher levels of demand when upgraded (made faster and more frequent) than corridors that get almost no ridership now. This argues for (1) incremental upgrades where the benefits outweigh the costs, (2) focusing on specific proven markets rather than trying to connect random large cities. David Levinson We should be looking for routes where train is more cost-effective than either driving or taking an airplane. This distance is certainly less than 600 miles for most of the US, under current costs of travel. (Once we have proven we can connect large places closer than 100 miles, we should connect large places less than 200 miles, and then expand outward. We should not start with a grand vision which will simply collapse of its own weight). We should also be looking for routes with large trip generators at either end. Examining the first map shows a lot of non-sensical routes. I can't rate them in order of nonsensicalness, some are just too problematic. This is not to say there are not segments which could productively be (and are) served by rail. The Northeast corridor is one. Chicago to Milwaukee is one. Los Angeles to San Diego is one. There are a few others. The key point is they are local serving, and should be locally supported. There is no need for US federal involvement. If the projects are worthwhile, the states and cities and private railroads should fund them. Almost all the benefits are local, the costs should be borne by those who benefit. These segments can grow into systems that should be (1) separately organized, managed, governed, and operated to improve local responsiveness and reliability, and (2) allowed to evolve organically based on incremental changes and extensions. We do not ask San Francisco's BART to interline with Washington DC's Metro, nor should we expect a useful local service from Chicago to Champaign-Urbana to interline with a potentially useful route from Richmond to Washington, DC. By doing so you create dependencies (a blizzard in the Northeast holds up train service in Illinois) without any advantages. High-speed rail is a difficult proposition to begin with in the United States. In the 50 years after it was opened in Japan, it has yet to come to pass in the US. There are reasons for this, beyond simple political obstinacy. The markets are different, the conditions are different (when HSR was opened in Japan, its airlines were highly regulated, e.g. Further, Japan has a much higher overall population density.) The US has been unimpressed with its passenger rail service for many decades (since well before Amtrak was formed to pick up the pieces of private passenger rail service), and has lost its rail-building and train-building skill-base. When we study successful technologies and networks (e.g. The Internet, the London Underground), we see they grow from a seed, and expand outward - not from the top down. This is natural, it is risk-averse, it allows learning to occur before over-building. Not all technologies or networks will succeed, it is best to learn that early than after building a giant White Elephant.
AP/Getty This morning comes the shocking news that Pope Benedict XVI intends to resign as Pope later this month after a nearly-eight year reign as Supreme Pontiff of the Catholic Church. This is a distressing and‚Äìto some degree‚Äìunprecedented‚Äìmove. There are only three examples of Popes resigning in the history of the Church and they all came under extraordinary circumstances, none have done it for reasons of health, which appear to be at the forefront . In 1045, Pope Benedict IX was pressured to resign but was eventually re-installed on the Papal throne because his resignation appeared to be ‚Äúselling‚Äù his office. Pope Celestine V, a reclusive monk, resigned in 1294. He had months earlier declared it permissible for a Pope to resign, establishing the tiny legal precedent that Benedict appears to be exercising now. Finally Pope Gregory XII abdicated the papal throne in 1415 to end the great Western Schism. Benedict‚Äôs own pontificate appears incomplete. His project of re-ordering the Curia Offices (the machinery of the Vatican) seems only half-complete. He has said that one of the missions of his papacy was to heal the schism with a group of Traditionalists, the Society of St. Pius X. That task remains unfinished and seems unlikely to be taken up by his successors. His efforts at reforming the post-Vatican II worship of the Catholic Church seem tenuous and even timid, though he may have provided momentum to the cause. Of course the next question is who will succeed Pope Benedict XVI? ¬†Whoever is chosen by the College of Cardinals at the forthcoming conclave will have the delicate task of governing the Church while his predecessor still lives.We've gone through the likely names, weighed the odds, and assessed the pros and cons of each possible candidate.

Big bombshell news of the day is that Pope Benedict will resign on February 28, citing his health. So who will be the next pope? Last April, Michael Brendan Dougherty put together a fantastic guide on the likely names, complete with the pros and cons for each name. For a cruder look, here are the odds, via Irish betting side Paddy Power. The top contenders by Paddy Power's odds: A lot of the discussion about the next pope -- which will be decided by the Conclave Of The College Of Cardinals in a couple months -- will have to do whether the Pope is non-white, and comes from either an African or Latin country.

From RadioVaticana.va, here's the full statement of Pope Benedict on his resignation. ---------- Dear Brothers,I have convoked you to this Consistory, not only for the three canonizations, but also to communicate to you a decision of great importance for the life of the Church. After having repeatedly examined my conscience before God, I have come to the certainty that my strengths, due to an advanced age, are no longer suited to an adequate exercise of the Petrine ministry. I am well aware that this ministry, due to its essential spiritual nature, must be carried out not only with words and deeds, but no less with prayer and suffering. However, in todayís world, subject to so many rapid changes and shaken by questions of deep relevance for the life of faith, in order to govern the bark of Saint Peter and proclaim the Gospel, both strength of mind and body are necessary, strength which in the last few months, has deteriorated in me to the extent that I have had to recognize my incapacity to adequately fulfill the ministry entrusted to me. For this reason, and well aware of the seriousness of this act, with full freedom I declare that I renounce the ministry of Bishop of Rome, Successor of Saint Peter, entrusted to me by the Cardinals on 19 April 2005, in such a way, that as from 28 February 2013, at 20:00 hours, the See of Rome, the See of Saint Peter, will be vacant and a Conclave to elect the new Supreme Pontiff will have to be convoked by those whose competence it is.Dear Brothers, I thank you most sincerely for all the love and work with which you have supported me in my ministry and I ask pardon for all my defects. And now, let us entrust the Holy Church to the care of Our Supreme Pastor, Our Lord Jesus Christ, and implore his holy Mother Mary, so that she may assist the Cardinal Fathers with her maternal solicitude, in electing a new Supreme Pontiff. With regard to myself, I wish to also devotedly serve the Holy Church of God in the future through a life dedicated to prayer. From the Vatican, 10 February 2013 BENEDICTUS PP XVI
AP Coming out of nowhere ... Pope Benedict is set to resign due to health reasons on February 28, according to multiple reports. The news was first broken by Italian news agency ANSA, which put the following banner at the top of its site, specifically saying that the Pope would leave the Pontificate. Ansa.it Other news organizations quickly confirmed the news. Kelly Evans of CNBC cites Dow Jones. Vatican confirms to DJN: Pope will resign on Feb. 28. Wow. Then a full statement was released by the Vatican, confirming that the Pope will resign on the evening of February 28, due to ill health. While this is a surprise, it's not completely out of nowhere. The Pope's resignation was actually speculated about early last year, due to his declining health. This is the first papal resignation since 1415. Last year, Michael Brendan Dougherty put together a guide on who will likely be the next pope &gt;
Flickr/°Que comunismo!After 2 months without Chavez, Venezuela government voices optimism but some expect new vote CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) ó Two months have passed since Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez climbed the stairs of the presidential jet, blew kisses to his supporters and flew to Cuba to undergo his fourth cancer-related surgery. Chavez hasn't been seen or spoken publicly since that departure to Havana on Dec. 10, and the mystery surrounding his condition has deepened while the government's updates have remained optimistic but have lately offered few specifics. "The president is in charge and making decisions," Foreign Minister Elias Jaua said Saturday after meeting with Brazil's foreign minister. "It's a slow, slow recovery process. But he is fighting his battle with great faith, and clinging to Christ and clinging to life ... and with the conviction that he is going to win this battle, too." Jaua, who visited Chavez in Cuba last week, said the 58-year-old president has been making political and economic decisions. On Friday, for instance, the government announced it is devaluing the currency. Confidants including Jaua have recently said the president has overcome complications including a severe respiratory infection following his Dec. 11 surgery for recurrent cancer in his pelvic region. Vice President Nicolas Maduro, whom Chavez named as his potential successor before the surgery, has said that the president should be able to return home once his condition permits it. When that might be remains unclear, and the long silence of a leader who used to speak on television almost every day has led many Venezuelans to wonder why he is unable to say at least a few words to the country by phone. Some analysts say they expect that sooner or later, Chavez's delicate health could make necessary a new election to replace him. "The transition has already begun in Venezuela, and the election campaign has also begun," said Tulio Hernandez, a sociologist and professor at the Central University of Venezuela. "The transition has also begun in people's heads. Sometimes, there are mistakes among government spokespeople, who start to speak of Chavez in the past tense." Maduro and National Assembly President Diosdado Cabello have recently led street demonstrations where supporters have rallied around the president chanting his name and holding photos of him. If Chavez were to die or step down from the presidency, a new presidential vote would be called within 30 days. The long silence has left many Venezuelans, including both supporters and detractors of the president, on edge amid rumors and speculation. "Whether we wanted to or not, it used to be inevitable to hear him, see him, talk about him," said Emilia Torres, a university student who supports the opposition. "Now he's disappeared. We haven't seen him in a long time. We don't even know if he's really OK or not." Chavez has undergone several cancer treatments in Cuba since June 2011, including surgeries, chemotherapy and radiation treatment. He hasn't revealed the type of cancer or the exact location where tumors have been removed from his pelvic region. During previous stints in Cuba, Chavez regularly kept in contact through phone calls broadcast on television and messages on Twitter. Now, those messages have been replaced by updates given by his Cabinet ministers. The updates recently have been given less frequently, while government officials say Chavez's condition has slowly improved. "I want them to tell us the truth. I don't want to keep seeing ministers saying that El Comandante sends us regards," said Lenin Colmenares, a street vendor who sells posters and photos with images of Chavez. "I hope El Comandante himself will be the one to say it. Why doesn't he?" Colmenares said he hopes the president will be able to return. He also said none of the other officials in his socialist movement can compare to the charismatic leader. "I'm for the revolutionary process, but if I support another one (within Chavez's movement) it's only because El Comandante asked for it," Colmenares said. "That man is unique." Chavez, who counts 19th century independence leader Simon Bolivar and former Cuban leader Fidel Castro among his leading influences, first took office in 1999 and was re-elected to a new six-year term in October. Throughout his presidency, he has cultivated an image as the sole leader of his Bolivarian Revolution movement. Now, he has turned to Maduro and others to carry on in his absence. "We're obviously at a crossroads," said Oscar Valles, a political analyst and professor at the Metropolitan University in Caracas. He said that during the past two months, "it's been hard for the predominant circle within Chavismo to articulate leadership that can begin to replace that of the president in this difficult transition." There have been previous cases of leaders in other countries vanishing from public view for long stretches due to health problems. Fidel Castro, for one, has appeared in public only occasionally since he fell ill in 2006 and formally stepped aside from the presidency less than two years later. In Nigeria, President Umaru Yar'Adua left the country for medical treatment in 2009 and died months later. Venezuelan lawmakers voted last month to indefinitely postpone Chavez's Jan. 10 inauguration. The opposition argued that was unconstitutional, but the Supreme Court sided with the government and ruled that the president could be sworn in before the court at a later date. "I don't think I'm exaggerating in saying that what's happening in Venezuela is historically unheard of," Valles said in a telephone interview. "We've never before seen a political process where a term is indefinitely extended." Copyright (2013) Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Flickr / James BoweWe're getting even closer to March 1, the day the "sequester" kicks in, and automatic across-the-board spending cuts go into place that would slam the military and harm the economy. The latest talk from this weekend's Sunday shows indicate no change. The GOP seems willing to take the cuts. There's virtually no movement. From Ben White at Morning Money: SEQUESTER UPDATE: VERY LITTLE MOVEMENT ‚Äì President Obama heads into the State of the Union this week with very limited evidence that Republicans are inclined to accede to his demand that any sequester replacement include an equal amount of spending cuts and revenue increases through tax reform. The only slight movement over the weekend came from Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) on Fox News Sunday.¬† ‚Ä¶¬†¬†¬†¬† Asked about the issue, McCain said: ‚ÄúWould I look at some revenue closers? Maybe so. But we‚Äôve already just raised taxes. Why do we have to raise taxes again?‚Äù (Never mind that hanging hope on McCain is a thin reed given the issue has always been the House) ‚Ä¶ Meanwhile, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said on Fox that there have already been ‚Äúplenty of spending cuts.‚Äô She left Republicans aghast when she added: "It is almost a false argument to say we have a spending problem.‚Äù Even folks like Bill McBride of Calculated Risk -- who has been pretty sanguine on the whole fiscal cliff/sequester story -- is now thinking that he was wrong, and that the cuts are likely to go into place. Of course, the State Of The Union is tomorrow, and it seems very likely that this will be discussed.¬† And given how Washington can get a lot done in just the final days of any manufactured "crisis", there's still plenty of time.
BofA's proprietary measure of investor sentiment is clocking in at extreme levels. According to the firm's Bull &amp; Bear Index, which tracks sentiment using indicators like hedge fund market exposure, fund flows, long-only investor positioning and so forth, investors are more bullish than they were in 99% of periods since 2002. The current B&amp;B reading is 9.6 (on a scale of 0 for max bearish and 10 for max bullish). It suggests investor sentiment is currently more bullish than 99% of all readings since 2002. Extreme bullishness is characterized by robust inflows to EM equity funds, overbought high-yield credit markets relative to treasuries and aggressive hedge fund positions for a weaker yen and stronger oil prices. BofA What's even worse. This extreme surge in bullishness comes even as there's been a breakdown of late in the economic data, as measured by the BofA/ML Economic Surprise Index. BofA Thus bulls should have reason to worry. Everyone is bullish, and lately he data isn't holding up so hot, relative to expectations. In the meantime, the moment of truth for the economy approaches &gt;
Flickr/Z¸rich | Zurich | ZurigoThere's a growing meme that the market and the economy are about to have a date with destiny. The thinking is this: Markets have surged all year like there's not a care in the world. On the other hand, the economy has already been buffeted by one major headwind (the end of the payroll tax holiday) and it could be hit by another (the upcoming sequestration spending cuts. As such, we're about to know whether the economy can really justify the market rally, or whether risky assets will have to come floating back down to earth. BofA/ML strategist David Woo described this to us as a "moment of truth" for the economy, and anticipated the fight over the sequester (which takes place over the coming weeks) will be where it all happens. Other folks have called this a "tipping point" for the market, but it's basically the same idea. In a note to clients, Citi's Steven Englander says that a big test is coming up this week, on Wednesday in fact. That's when we get January retail sales, which he calls 'The Most Important Datapoint So Far This Year.' The big question for the US economy is how much of a headwind the January 1 tax hike has become for US activity. Janaury retail sales would by far be affected more directly than January payrolls or ISMs, so retail sales will be the first really hard data on the impact of the tax hike.† Expectations are relatively muted. The consensus is for headline and ex-autos at +0.1% m/m (Citi economists expect +0.2% and +0.3%, on the view that momentum will persist. Core retail sales are expected to growth 0.3% m/m by the consensus and 0.4% by Citi economists. The moment of truth is coming. And it starts this Wednesday.
