APThe new deal being†brokered in the Senate by Majority Leader Harry Reid and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell seems far from certain to pass the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.† The outline of the deal called for it to fund the government through Jan. 15 and raise the debt ceiling through mid-February. It was greeted with lukewarm reception from conservatives Monday night.† The government shutdown entered into its 14th day on Monday. And Congress needs to raise the debt ceiling by Thursday, the Treasury Department says, or the U.S. would risk defaulting on some of its obligations.† House Republicans criticized the possible Senate deal to both National Review's Jonathan Strong†and Politico's Jake Sherman and John Bresnahan†on Monday night ó a gloomy sign with a Thursday deadline fast approaching.† The main tradeoff in the Senate deal would involve a one-year delay in the Obamacare reinsurance tax (which would be viewed as a win for Democrats, presumably, since unions oppose the tax) ó in exchange for an income-verification measure for those applying for subsidies under the health-care law (a win for Republicans).† Rep. Pat Tiberi (R-Ohio) doesn't see that as a win for his side. More from National Review: ìItís less robust than I had expected,î says Representative Steve Stivers, a top ally to Speaker John Boehner, about the reported terms of the Senate deal. Asked if heíd seen anything in the deal that appeals to the GOP, Representative James Lankford, the fifth-ranking member of House leadership, says ìnot that Iíve seen so far, no.î Politico frames the story†as a potential choice for House Speaker John Boehner. He could decide for the House to act on its own while the Senate tries to pass this bill. He could decide to wait for the Senate bill, then amend it to add a conservative priority.†Or he could bring the Senate bill up for a vote. But, according to Politico, one Republican said that Boehner would be lucky for Boehner to get 20 Republican votes on the current version of the Senate deal. This is what many concede will probably have to happen ó but it's not clear when, and it "won't be pretty," according to Politico. Sources close to Boehner have given no inclination as to whether he's leaning a certain way. A Democratic Senate aide told Business Insider earlier Monday that it's up to McConnell to sell the deal to Boehner ó no sure thing. "Our job is to get the best deal we can get that House Dems can support," the aide said.†
Citigroup reports earnings tomorrow at 8:00 a.m. with conference call to follow at 11:00 a.m. ó analysts expect earnings per share to come in at $1.09 and revenue of $18.8 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That's only a slight improvement from Q3 2012, when the bank reported an EPS of $1.06 and revenue of $18.2 billion. Yet, hot shot Wall Street analysts are bullish on the stock based on the company's efforts to cut costs and its†continued divestment of assets held in Citigroup Holding, a unit that holds all the businesses Citi wants to get rid of. Last month, CLSA's Mike Mayo called Citi a buy†and smacked a $66 price target on the stock. The stock ended the trading day today at $49.60. There are a few reasons, however, to worry about the numbers Citi will report tomorrow. Firstly, both of the major banks that have reported so far ó JP Morgan and Wells Fargo ó took a hit in their mortgage businesses. The number of customers refinancing declined and the pace of new mortgage origination slowed as interest rates rose. Analysts are worried that Citi's mortgage business will get hit the same way. They're also worried that Citi will follow Deutsche Bank and Jefferies in reporting miserable fixed income trading revenue for the quarter. Jefferies, for example, reported an 88% decline in fixed income trading revenue year over year. Another area of concern more specific to Citigroup has to do with its huge presence in emerging markets. For the last two years EM have fueled two-thirds of Citi's revenue growth. This summer those markets got spanked. That could be reflected in the numbers we see tomorrow morning.
There are some disconcerting details in this National Review report about how the House GOP would handle any deal that comes out of the Senate (if a deal ever materializes). But regardless, markets are higher this evening. Japan is up modestly after gains in the US Monday. FinViz ¬†US futures are also, interestingly, modestly higher.
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer StudiosFA Insights is a daily newsletter from Business Insider that delivers the top news and commentary for financial advisors. How Robo-Advisors Are Changing The Wealth Management Playing Field (Advisor Perspectives) Wealth Management is changing with the emergence of "robo-advisors" i.e.¬† "a new breed of startups that directly connect tech-savvy investors with suites of analytic tools to create financial plans or investment portfolios," writes Raef Lee, managing director for the SEI Advisor Network, in Advisor Perspectives. And there are five key ways in which robo-advisors will change the playing field for more traditional advisors.¬† 1. Robo-advisors increase the pressure for advisors to charge lower fees. 2. Investors will begin to expect more transparent fee structures. 3. Robo-advisors are more young-investor-friendly, and younger investors could stick with robo-advisors as they become wealthier. 4. Investors will start expecting newer ways of interacting with their advisor, like "web conferencing" and "intuitive ways of working on documents together." 5. They will ask for more "comparative data." Advisors Are Considering Replacing Bonds With Business Development Companies (The Wall Street Journal)  As investors get anxious about their bond holdings, advisors are wondering what to replace them with. Russ Conrad of New York-based Princeton Equity Partners favors privately traded business development companies (BDC). In a new WSJ column, he writes that private BDCs invest in debt and equity, "nontraded funds that invest in debt and equity in private, middle-market companies in the U.S.."¬† "We prefer to invest in BDCs that themselves invest in the top performing sectors of the economy like business services, hospitality, food and beverage, health care and energy and power. "We look for BDCs that hold loans at a floating interest rate so that when rates rise you're not stuck in the same position that a lot of bond portfolios are in right now. Look for investments that are in senior secured debt, so that if something happens to the companies in the BDC there is a better opportunity to regain investments. For us, it's also important to find BDCs that underwrite their underlying loans. Do your homework. Find out who the originator of the loan is and who will underwrite them." European Stocks Have Their Best Run In 11 Years But This Signals Short Term Caution (BofA Merrill Lynch)  Investors began diving into European stocks as the euro-area economy emerged from a recession. This is the fifteenth straight week of inflows into EU equity funds, write BofA Merrill Lynch investment strategists led by John Bilton, the best run in 11-years. "‚ÄúLong Europe‚Äù is popular, but it may be more a verbal consensus than a practical one ‚Äì real money is just starting to buy, only 1/7th of cumulative outflows since 07 have reversed, and many investors are wanting to call the top." BofA Merrill Lynch European Investment Strategy, EPFR Six Things Advisors Should Know About Managing Millennials (WealthManagement.com)  Younger advisors have different expectations than their older colleagues. Susan Konig at WealthManagement.com has highlighted six key things to managing millennials. 1. While they expect their compensation to be competitive they also expect to their compensation to reflect their performance. 2. As long as they meet their goals they expect to have more control over their schedules. 3. They value "formal and informal training opportunities that will increase their value." 4. They want "access to decision makers." 5. They also want credit for their work. 6. They want control of their projects.  MARC FABER: There Are No Safe Havens For Investors (Bloomberg TV)  With the debt ceiling deadline fast approaching and uncertainty about when the Fed will begin tapering its $85 billion monthly asset purchase program, some investors are looking for safe haven investments to protect their wealth. But Marc Faber, author of "The Gloom Boom And Doom Report," told Bloomberg TV there is no safe haven and investors are better off with diversified portfolios.¬† "There is no safe haven. Bank deposits are not safe, which used to be safe. Money in treasury bills is not 100% safe because there is inflation in the system and you hardly get any interest. Bonds are not very safe anymore because eventually interest rates will go up. Equities in the US are relatively expensive by any valuation metrics you might use. I don't see anything particularly safe. The best you can hope for is that you have a diversified portfolio of different assets and that they don't all collapse at the same time."
Russian billionaire Vladimir Potanin bought a $95,000 white truffle from NYC restaurateur Nello Balan, according to the New York Post. And now that we're over the price tag, the only question remains... what the heck is Potanin going to do with all that expensive truffle? White Alba truffles, as they're known formally, are incredibly rare. They hail from the Alba region of Italy and have never been domesticated ó dogs and pigs are used to hunt them where they grow at the base of oak trees. White Albas are also seasonal, which means here in NYC, around late September/early October total truffle madness ensues. Shipments are well documented on food blogs around town, and restaurants tweet out updates of their truffle supply status. Business Insider reached out to some local foodies to see what they would do with four pounds of these incredibly rare fungi and the response was quick ó first thing's first, said one, "I'd make truffle oil to sprinkle on EVERYTHING!" That involves simmering the truffle in oil so that its flavor is released into the oil. The stronger you want the flavor, the more truffle it will take, and Potanin's chef definitely won't use all of it. Four pounds is a lot of truffle. After you've got the truffle infused oil, you can use it to make glorious truffle fries (or something else... but we like fries). It also might be a good idea to dry some of the white Alba truffles and freeze them for a rainy day. After that, the world is Potanin's oyster. The white Albas can be infused into butter, cream, cheese or milk (you may want to freeze those dairy products too). The truffles can be used in a pasta or risotto (pretty standard), or you can just put a healthy portion on top of your favorite dish. Some winning dishes from last year's NYC truffle season include Restaurant†Marc Forgione's addition of white Alba shavings to his brick chicken and Colicchio and Sons' gnocchi with white truffles. As Eater NY put it so succinctly last month ó "Expect†truffle burgers, truffle pizzas, truffletinis, and truffle tastings†to land on menus around the city in the coming weeks. Maybe†Dominique Ansel†will throw us a bone and stuff some truffles in a Cronut." We'll see what kind of truly inspired truffle dishes come out of this season's mania after the dust settles and the city runs out. Vladimir Potanin, for his part, won't have to do that kind of soul searching for a while.
If confirmed, Janet Yellen will preside over a Board of Governors and an FOMC that are "significantly more transparent and innovative" than when Ben Bernanke first joined as governor in 2002, Credit Suisse's Neal Soss recently wrote to clients. Bernanke's Fed was more "democratic and permissive," resulting in a clearer image of the Fed's ideological mosaic. Of course, that mosaic will change slightly when new members receive voting power in 2014. From the note: Two frequent dissenters with stringent anti-inflation views will have votes in 2014 ñ Charles Plosser (Philadelphia) and Richard Fisher (Dallas). Their positions as voters will more than offset Esther Georgeís (Kansas City Fed) loss of a vote next year. This year was Georgeís first term as an FOMC voter, and she has dissented in favor of tighter policy in every policy meeting to date ñ six so far.  Also moving into voting positions next year will be Narayana Kocherlakota (Minneapolis) and Sandra Pianalto (Cleveland). Once counted among the hawks, Kocherlakota is now one of the most dovish of the district bank presidents. Pianalto, more neutral in her policy leanings, never dissented in her five previous voting terms.† Soss provides his "hawk/dove" scale from September, with the caveat that "one should be cautious in the use of blanket labels to characterize the predilections of Fed officials."

The Supreme Court will hear arguments Tuesday in a case accusing DaimlerChrysler AG (now Daimler AG) of collaborating to have left-wing sympathizers tortured or killed during Argentina's Dirty War. Mercedes-Benz in Argentina, then a subsidiary of Daimler-Benz AG,†allegedly notified the Argentinian government of plant-workers subversive to the government in the 70s and 80s when a military dictatorship in Argentina kidnapped, tortured, and murdered almost 30,000 "subversives," notably labor union members and organizers. A group of 22 survivors and heirs, all either Argentinian citizens or residents, sued DaimlerChrysler AG†in California in 2005 under the Alien Tort Statute, which lets people sue foreign companies for human rights violations in U.S. courts. They allege the company knew the Argentinian government would kidnap, torture, and murder these workers, thus silencing union activists.† Their case has to have some connection to the U.S. in order for their lawsuit in California to survive, SCOTUSBlog has explained. But German automaker Daimler Benz AG's merger with US automaker Chrysler in 1998 makes this case harder to understand. The two companies briefly became DaimlerChrysler AG, before selling Chrysler in 2007, leaving German-owned Daimler AG. When the suit was filed, Daimler Benz AG, a German corporation, had merged with the American Chrysler Corporation to form DCAG. Therefore, a California court initially ruled DCAG maintained "dual operational headquarters" in Germany and Detroit, Mich, according to the opinion. The company also fully owns its American subsidiary, Mercedes Benz USA, which does business often in California. Therefore, the German owned DCAG, maintained† "systematic and continuous contact" with the state, according to the opinion.  In this suit, DaimlerAG is appealing that decision. The outcome of this case could have broad effects on the legal responsibility of corporate entities, foreign or not, for human rights abuses in the U.S. court system.
Yale professor Robert Shiller won the Nobel Prize in Economics this morning. Among other things, Shiller correctly predicted the U.S. housing bubble when no one else would. With prices still off of their all-time highs, many can't help but ask the brilliant Professor if now's the time to invest in housing. And for years, he has responded with more or less the same answer: housing is not a great investment. This was an idea that he pushed in his must-read book, Irrational Exuberance. Here are quotes from one particularly memorable exchange with Bloomberg's Trish Regan, when Shiller dismantles the idea of investing in a home: Trish Regan: "Then why buy a home? People trap their savings in a home. They're running an opportunity cost of not having that money liquid to earn a better return in the market. Why do it?" Robert Shiller: "Absolutely! Housing traditionally is not viewed as a great investment. It takes maintenance, it depreciates, it goes out of style. All of those are problems. And there's technical progress in housing. So, new ones are better... "So, why was it considered an investment? That was a fad. That was an idea that took hold in the early 2000's. And I don't expect it to come back. Not with the same force. So people might just decide, "Yeah, I'll diversify my portfolio. I'll live in a rental." That is a very sensible thing for many people to do. "If you think investing in housing is such a great idea, why not invest in cars? Buy a car, mothball it, and sell it in 20 years. Obviously not a good idea because people won't want our cars. It's the same with our houses. So, they're not really an investment vehicle." Homeowners understand that you can't sell a home with 30-year-old roofing, carpet, and kitchen appliances. Sure, the home price might go up, but investors must adjust prices for years of maintenance and renovations. You can watch the video at Bloomberg.com.

A tipster passed along this email from an MBA student sent to his school's finance association. It's about how it's poor form to call a banker an "i banker" or an investment bank an "i bank," based on his own internship experience. This email is getting forward all over the place. The former bank intern begins the email, by calling everyone "guys and girls." He then proceeds to apologize about skipping the group's events because his suits no longer fit after four months of wining and dining with his banker buddies. † The recipients of the email, all MBA students, found the tone of the email condescending, and are passing it around like crazy. "Everyone in the association is copied on these emails, so the guy obviously knew what he was doing with this 'lecture,' though I'm not sure his interning in banking taught him that email spreads quickly†among†these offices ..." our tipster said.† Check it out:† Business Insider tipster
APThe White House abruptly canceled a 3 p.m. meeting at the White House among President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, and congressional leaders amid ongoing discussions on a potential deal to reopen the government and raise the nation's debt ceiling. The postponement came about 20 minutes before the meeting was scheduled to start. And it's a good thing, a Senate Democratic leadership aide told Business Insider. It means both sides are making progress toward a deal. "McConnell [is] presenting to his conference, so we‚Äôll see if Ted Cruz revolts or not," the aide said. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid¬†presented the offer an offer to Minority Leader Mitch McConnell¬†earlier in the day. The draft version of the agreement would keep the government funded through January and raise the debt ceiling through mid-February. The deal would also set up a budget conference to end no later than Dec. 13. Prospects of passage in the House were far from certain, however. The Senate Democratic aide said that the final deal will probably include some income-verification measure with regards to obtaining subsidies for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. But it wouldn't be anything¬†"too impactful that changes ability to enroll in any meaningful way," the aide said. The House passed a bill in September along party lines that would require¬†the¬†Department of Health and Human Services¬†inspector general to set up a verification program before it grants subsidies. According to reports, the deal could also include a one-year delay in an¬†Obamacare reinsurance tax, which has been opposed by unions.¬† The Affordable Care Act requires states to set up a transitional reinsurance program whose aim is to stabilize insurance premiums. The provision required that companies providing health care to pay a $63 fee per person tax in 2014 as part of the transition. Reid told reporters on Capitol Hill Monday morning that "we're getting closer" to a deal, and that he hopes there will be a deal roughly in place before the meeting. Senate Republicans postponed a meeting scheduled for Monday night. They'll instead meet on Tuesday morning at 11 a.m. so more members can attend. The federal government shutdown entered into its 14th day on Monday. And Congress needs to raise the debt ceiling by Thursday, at which point the Treasury will only have about $30 billion cash on hand to meet all of its obligations.

Why are really, really rich men so interested in art, beyond that it is expensive. Beauty? Sure, why not. Although, clearly, the pursuit of beauty was only, at best, a runner up to a career making all that dough. Status, obviously. Competition with other billionaire collectors. Respectability? Except, expensive art is now a pretty sure sign that you are fast, loose, and overblown, if not corrupt. The world's leading art collector is Steven Cohen, the head of SAC Capital, which the Justice Department has hunted and now cornered in the biggest insider trading scandal ever. After Cohen, many of the other major art buyers are other hedge funders, Russian gangsters, and Chinese billionaires. Art collector is a new term for vulgarian. The hedge funder Dan Loeb, billionaire and competitive collector, has now turned his activist investor attention to Sotheby's, buying nearly 10% of the company and seeking to oust its CEO. Cohen, before him, made a grab for Sotheby's too, as have various other financial arrivistes. The interest in Sotheby's may help explain something about why rich men find art so compelling and about the modern nature of art itself. Sotheby's has long had one foot in the world of class, manners, and taste, and the other in the new world of the crass, the louche, and the questionable ñ it's former chairman, Alfred Taubman, the mall mogul and billionaire, once went to jail for price fixing. In a way, Sotheby's has been one of the ways people of lesser standing but greater cash move up in the world. Sotheby's can launder you. You can go into an auction as a nobody and emerge as someone to contend with. Sotheby's sells social cachet. Rich men are drawn to markets, to the place and method, as well as the general atmosphere and attitude that lets goods and cash meet and be traded. A market's a place of opportunities. And Sotheby's is as much a market as the stock exchange. Adding to its attraction, the Sotheby's marketplace is more controllable than the stock market, and with far less oversight. Like the stock exchange, it has a further market dynamism because both sides of its transactions are currencies. Like stocks, art, in itself, has come to have an intrinsic and quantifiable value. You turn it into cash only for greater convenience or as a hedge (or, if things go so badly for you that you actually need money). But you could just as well, if you are rich, safely and advantageously move your wealth only among works of art. Indeed, one of its appeals to the wealthy, and in particular to hedge funders, is that as a currency, art is far more manipulable than most other currencies, save perhaps drugs. If it is not the most corrupt business, art is certainly one of the most loosey-goosey and illogical ones. At the heart of Loeb's argument with how Sotheby's might more aggressively do its business is his charge that the auction house, which continues to do a substantial business in old and modern masters, does not "fully grasp the central importance of contemporary art to the company's growth, which is highly problematic since these are the categories expanding most rapidly among new collectors". That is, among new money collectors like himself. Indeed, it's this anomaly that is, most curiously, at the center of the art business: new work that continues to be produced, of which there is no real limited quantity, and that has no long-term track record of maintaining value, is now worth much more than the work of historic artists with limited availability and demonstrable value. This rather defines an extreme bubble: escalating prices for something of unlimited supply. Obviously, at least in the short term, Loeb is right. This is a hell of a business: artists, of a certain name and marketing finesse, can essentially print money. Likewise, hedge funders of a certain public finesse seem to be able to print money too. Modern art, of a certain type, and modern investing, of a certain type, are perception plays. Their disruptive presence attains market notice and hence value. You can hardly do better to reaffirm your status as a fly in the ointment of wealth than make trouble at Sotheby's. You've commanded the attention of the world's vulgarians, and, hence, some of the great pools of money. From a competitive view, and art is surely a competitive sport, a seat on the Sotheby's board surely couldn't hurt. In a social sense, that could be worth more than a slew of Damien Hirsts. Like many hedge fund-type collectors, Loeb's own collection, while full of brand names ñ Andy Warhol, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Richard Prince, Cindy Sherman, Mike Kelley and Mart Kippenberger, according to the Wall Street Journal ñ is sniffed at in the art world. He spent a lot, but, in that telling characteristic of the rich, being cheap, he didn't spend enough for the best. This must be annoying. Not just to be judged on amount but on quality. So Sotheby's is in a sense a purer play than art itself. It's the art market, which is the sexy and thrilling thing about art. This article originally appeared on guardian.co.uk 
UK Land RegistryLondon house prices rose 7.1% from a year earlier in August, significantly higher than the 1.3% year-over-year rise in prices across the rest of England and Wales.In a weekend New York Times opinion piece, London-based journalist Michael Goldfarb describes a trend of neighbors relocating from London to other metropolitan areas in Great Britain due to soaring housing prices. "This is what happens when property in your city becomes a global reserve currency," writes Goldfarb. "The gap between London prices and those of the rest of the country is now at a historic high, and there is only one way to explain it. London houses and apartments are a form of money." Goldfarb chalks up London property's reserve currency status to favorable property tax laws ‚Äî those property owners with additional residences outside the country are only taxed on their British earnings, effectively turning the London market into a giant tax haven. "In 2011, at the height of the euro zone crisis, citizens of the two countries at the epicenter of the cataclysm ‚Äî Greece and Italy ‚Äî bought 400 million pounds‚Äô worth of London bricks and mortar," writes Goldfarb. "The Italian and Greek rich, fearing the single currency would collapse, got their money out of euros and parked it someplace where government was relatively stable, and the tax regime was gentle ‚Äî very, very gentle." But there's more to the story, as Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale global strategist Kit Juckes points out in a note. SG Cross Asset Research"Demographics are putting a strain on the U.K.'s infrastructure, which is a major factor in keeping inflation higher than in the euro area or the U.S., and can cause U.K. inflation to rise relative to both in the coming year or so," says Juckes.¬†"Some of the money that drives London house prices up is, as the NYT says, coming because it thinks London houses are a reserve asset; but outside Kensington, and closer to SG House in Tower Hill, the driver of residential property in Wapping, Shoreditch and Whitechapel looks like an influx of people looking for work in London." That influx of workers is the reason why the U.K. finds itself in an unusual position: wage growth isn't keeping up with inflation, which Juckes says is "one of¬†the main reasons why the U.K. economic recovery doesn‚Äôt 'feel' that good." SG Cross Asset ResearchJuckes expands on this in his note: The stubbornness of inflation and the lack of wage pressure are a feature of the U.K. economy at the moment. To a large degree they stem, in my opinion, from the pressures that come from rapid population/labour force growth, particularly in the South-East of the country. Strong labour force growth means demand rises faster than just looking at per capita income suggests. It also puts huge strains on infrastructure (gas, electricity, transport, education, health services, and refuse collection to mention a few). A cash-strapped government is allowing the cost of investing in more infrastructure to be passed onto consumers. And of course, a growing population, particularly one focused on a small part of the country, is putting pressure on housing. Martin Wolf in the FT says the British are no longer a nation of shopkeepers but a nation of property speculators. Be that as it may, the need to tame a runaway housing market is exactly what has resulted in U.K. rates being higher than those elsewhere and in turn, is why the pound has tended to be overvalued more often than not. And that inflation could mean the Bank of England eventually becomes the first major central bank to tighten policy in the wake of the global financial crisis. "There is a growing possibility that the U.K. MPC will increase rates before either the FOMC or the ECB, and will eventually have to take rates to a higher peak than either," says Juckes. "U.K. rates have been, on average, 1% higher than¬†either ECB or Fed ones since the birth of the Euro in 1999. The Fed will also hike rates long¬†before the ECB but it is the MPC that looks set to lead the way and in the process, I expect to¬†see a continued out-performance of the pound relative to the euro and the dollar, and a rise in Gilt¬†yields relative to Treasuries and Bunds."
Nello Balan, owner of ¬†Nello, an Upper East Side restaurant (and favored Wall Street eatery), has sold a 4 pound, $95,000 white truffle to Russian billionaire Vladimir Potanin, according to the New York Post.¬† It may be the largest white truffle ever sold. Bloomberg estimates Potanin's net worth at around $13.5 billion.¬†He is one of Russia's super rich businessmen known as an "oligarchs" that control vast amounts of Russia's natural resources. Potanin's wealth comes from nickel ‚Äî he owns¬†30.4 percent owner of Norilsk Nickel, the world's largest producer of the commodity. Potanin spends most of his time in Moscow, so it's likely that the truffle won't be in NYC for long. Given how serious the truffle bubble is getting in this town, though, that could be a good for all of us. Now see how can Potanin use those truffles&gt;&gt;
REUTERS/Jim YoungUniversity of Chicago professors Eugene F. Fama (L) and Lars Hansen attend a news conference after it was announced they won the 2013 Nobel Prize in Economics in Chicago, October 14, 2013. It's day 14 of the government shutdown. First, the scoreboard: And now the top stories:
Wall Street's big banks will be reporting third quarter earnings for the rest of this week, and there are two major issues making analysts nervous ‚Äî Wall Street's mortgage businesses and bank trading revenues in fixed-income. JP Morgan reported a quarterly loss on Friday, but that was a special case due to the government's legal crackdown on the bank. Citi, reporting tomorrow, Bank of America on Wednesday, Goldman Sachs reporting on Thursday, and Morgan Stanley reporting Friday all have other fish to fry. First ‚Äî and we saw issues around this on Friday with JP Morgan¬†and Wells Fargo ‚Äî rising interest rates are cutting into banks' mortgage origination businesses. Americans simply don't want to refinance at a higher rate, and taking out a new mortgage isn't as attractive as it was before. At JP Morgan that meant that the pace of new mortgages has slowed dramatically (remember, we're coming off the major lows of the financial crisis), and refinancing fell overall.¬† Expect this mortgage issue to be a big problem at Citi and Bank of America. Analysts are ¬†also worried about trading revenue, specifically when it comes to fixed-income markets. At the end of September, Brad Hintz, an analyst at¬†Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. wrote that Wall Street would see a¬†‚Äúa full-scale rout" in trading revenue.  Other analysts around the Street, like Marty Mosby at Guggenheim Securities, agreed and cut expectations en masse. This isn't coming out of nowhere, Jefferies and Deutsche Bank both reported horrific numbers in Q3 ‚Äî by horrific we mean Jefferies' fixed-income trading revenue plunged 88% year over year.¬† JP Morgan's fixed-income trading business didn't report a total pounding on Friday, just a slight smack ‚Äî the business is down 8% from Q3 2012. Other banks may not be so lucky. Bloomberg reports that based on his analysis of fixed-income trading,¬†Richard Staite, an analyst at Atlantic Equities LLP, cut his forecasted earnings per share at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley by 18% and 25% respectively. This could get ugly.
Economist Robert Shiller was one of three Americans to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics this morning. Shiller is well known in the investing community for his namesake valuation ratio: the Shiller P/E, aka the cyclically-adjusted price-earnings ratio (CAPE). CAPE is calculated by taking the S&amp;P 500 and dividing it by the average of ten years worth of earnings.¬† If the ratio is above the long-term average of around 16, the stock market is considered expensive. Shiller has argued that the CAPE is remarkably good at predicting returns over the period of several years. In his book Irrational Exuberance, Shiller argued that CAPE signaled a bubble in the stock market. The book was published in March 2000. And soon after, the dotcom bubble burst. And today, many investors swear by Shiller's CAPE ratio. But in an April 2012 interview with Money Magazine, Shiller said something stunning. "Things can go for 200 years and then change," he warned. "I even worry about the 10-year P/E ‚Äî even that relationship could break down." Even considering that risk, Shiller has consistently argued that stocks have looked more attractive than bonds and housing. While Shiller's CAPE may eventually break down, for now, it's held up.
Wikimedia CommonsThis weekend, Business Insider politics reporter Brett LoGiurato went to Gainesville, Florida to interview Rep. Ted Yoho (R-Fla.) who has insisted that hitting the debt ceiling would "bring stability to the world markets." In his interview with Business Insider, Yoho elaborated on this idea: What the Washington Post said, and what got picked up is, 'Ted Yoho thinks default is good for the government and for the economy.' And that's just an outright falsity or lying. Because what I said was, not raising the debt ceiling does not automatically trigger a default. And if we address our problems, and we say, 'Brett, I owe you money ‚Äî you know I owe you money, and I'm going to pay you. I'm going to pay you with interest. But we just need a little breathing room here to reorganize our debt.' I don't know if you've ever been in business with people who have owed you money‚Ä¶ And if you had someone that owed you money, and if they were to call you up and tell you that ‚Äî instead of just trying to hunt them down, you're not going to feel better about that? So, Yoho is proposing a restructuring of U.S. debts along the lines of a Chapter 13 bankruptcy. What he's describing ‚Äî going to your creditors, saying "we just need a little breathing room," and getting new terms on your debt that allow you to pay ‚Äî is the bankruptcy process. I used to be a banker, and in every loan agreement I ever worked on, filing for bankruptcy was high on the list of defaults. It is also possible to engage in a voluntary restructuring outside of bankruptcy. When a debtor calls up a creditor and asks for a reorganization, that might make the creditor "feel better" ‚Äî relative to a scenario where the debtor hides from the creditor and makes no payment at all. It does not make the creditor feel better compared to a scenario where the debtor pays as agreed. When a borrower comes to you asking for a restructuring on the grounds that he needs "breathing room," that is a sign of financial distress that warrants a high interest rate to compensate the lender for risk. If the U.S. is going to keep its world's-lowest borrowing costs, it can't be going to creditors saying it can't afford to pay as agreed. I understand why Republicans are frustrated. They were sure that President Obama's deficit spending would cause a debt crisis. Creditors would flee Treasuries out of fear that the U.S. will be unable to pay its debts. Or at least they would demand higher bond yields out of fear of inflation. But the bond markets have not cooperated; interest rates are very low and investors think the U.S. is a great credit. So Republicans have been forced to invent a debt crisis, either in their own minds, or in the real world by pushing the government into a default created by political circumstances instead of economic ones. They are sure that we can't afford to go on spending this way, and they will make sure that's the case, even if they have to break the financial system to do it. It's crazy. But then, these people are crazy.

ThinkorswimThe S&P 500 is up 3.0% from last Wednesday's low.The S&amp;P 500 is at its high of the day after going positive this afternoon. The index is currently trading at 1709, up 0.3%. According to a White House official, Congressional leaders will convene with President Obama and Vice President Biden to discuss the debt ceiling and the government shutdown at 3 PM ET today. However, the latest news is that the meeting has been postponed. Futures traded sideways for most of the morning, but are now 23 points off the last night's lows, above Friday's closing levels. The S&amp;P 500 rose quickly Thursday and Friday, and despite today's setback the index is still trading up 3.0% off the government-shutdown low made Wednesday at 1646. With no economic data releases today and a thin earnings calendar this morning, fiscal battles in Washington remain squarely in focus, and little progress was made over the weekend. "It is getting uncomfortably close to¬†Thursday¬†when the debt-ceiling is reached," says Miller Tabak chief economic strategist Andrew Wilkinson. "With the whole world¬†wagging their fingers at¬†lawmakers in¬†Washington¬†over a potentially devastating sequel to the collapse of Lehman Brothers¬†in the works, the only thing missing from the script is the appearance of aliens¬†at the White House."

Gallup's latest reading of its daily economic confidence index is at -41, down 40 points from a peak of -1 reached in late May. Half of the drop from May's peak to today's levels has happened in just the past two weeks, since the government shutdown started on October 1. At -41, the index is at the lowest level since December 12, 2011 ‚Äî almost two years ago. In other words, two weeks of government shutdown has helped erase two years of gains in consumer confidence. Only 28% of those polled by Gallup say the economic outlook is getting better, whereas 67% say it's getting worse. Gallup
Joe Raedle/Getty ImagesWhen we last checked in with San Diego realtor Jim Klinge, he said cash-rich investors had been fueling the market to new heights. Now, he says, although investors remain present,†buyers have regained some control. In his latest vlog post, he explains why: "serious" purchasers ó those who, unlike flippers, actually plan to stay in their home and must closely watch their finances ó are now reentering the market. He says: "People will say, 'Yeah you had 100 people, did you sell it?' 'No.' "But people are out looking. That's what the point is. People are out checking the market conditions. As long as people are out looking, the market is going to be fine. Shutdown, rates ó doesn't matter. Holidays...† ... "They're out seriously looking to buy a house. That's awesome for the market. ...

Wikimedia CommonsGAINESVILLE, Fla. ‚Äî¬†Rep. Ted Yoho (R-Fla.) shocked 24-year incumbent Rep. Cliff Stearns in Florida's District 3 Republican primary last year.¬† In his short time in office, Yoho has become part of a group of conservative Republicans who have taken charge in recent debates over government funding and raising the nation's debt ceiling. We had the chance to speak with Yoho as part of a trip to his district. The full conversation (edited slightly for length and clarity) is below. Business Insider: What do you see as the end game here, at this point? Rep. Ted Yoho:¬†I think we're going to keep passing these appropriations that we've done ‚Äî¬†you know, the individual appropriations. As you can tell, the whole system's broken. The American people are fed up with it ‚Äî as am I. That's one of the reasons I ran. But we've passed enough appropriations to keep one-third of the government funded. The Senate has refused to act on the majority of those.¬† BI: Is that plan going to go on for a while? There's a big [debt ceiling] deadline coming up Thursday, and even a lot of Republicans have plans now that would wrap the two issues in together.¬† Rep. Ted Yoho: Unfortunately, for the American people, I do. And again, the debt ceiling, to me, is the tsunami. I made that comment to one of the papers a week or two ago ‚Äî I think it was the Washington Post ‚Äî¬†that what we're seeing now is the tremor before the earthquake that causes the tsunami. That was the CR to keep the government open. The House has sent four continuing resolutions over to the Senate, and they have refused to act on them. And they say, well, you've got stipulations in there for the Affordable Care Act. Which we do. But keep in mind that we are the House of the people ‚Äî¬†the people's house ‚Äî and the people are the ones telling us to get rid of that law. I think we have been negotiating pretty well in their favor that we went from full defund to a one-year delay for the full bill ‚Äî and then it was just a one-year delay for the individual mandate, which to me, we've come off a lot. They have chosen not to fund the government.¬† BI: What about the debt ceiling? Rep. Ted Yoho: Again, the tsunami is the debt ceiling debate. And you saw where I stand on that. Not raising the debt ceiling is not an automatic trigger for a default. I want to say that again, so you get it right. Not raising the debt ceiling is not an automatic trigger for default.¬† BI: What, specifically, do you mean by that? Rep. Ted Yoho: Not raising the debt ceiling does not trigger a default, because we've got enough money to service our debts. Default is when you can't service your debt. Servicing your debt is, first, foreign interests. We've got plenty of money to do that. We take in between $250 and $300 billion a month. Our debt services between $25 and $30 billion a month. So with what the American government brings in, over a year's time, we can fund 85-86% of our debt. Until we can't pay a bill, I will not vote to raise the debt ceiling. When someone says we're going to be short a couple hundred-million dollars next month, I would be willing to raise the debt ceiling short term. And if we address these problems like you have to in business, I'm telling you ‚Äî it would stabilize the markets. Because the financial markets and the world markets will look at it and say ‚Äî I mean, how can they not look at it and say they're finally getting their problems under control. A lot of experts say that. Moody's says that. This country will not default. It is unconstitutional to do that, and I'm a constitutionalist. So therefore, we will not default. BI: So basically, in short, your argument is that Oct. 17 is not a hard deadline whatsoever? Rep. Ted Yoho: If you look at different reports, four months ago, we hit the debt ceiling. And they were using "extraordinary measures." Originally, our debt-ceiling mark was Dec. 15. And the Senate themselves moved it back to Nov. 15 in their non-negotiations with us. Because when we sent the CR over there, we talked about raising the debt ceiling. I didn't talk about it. The package was to raise the debt ceiling through Dec. 15. And the Senate said, no, we just need to raise it through Nov. 15. [Ed. note: The ping-ponging between the House and Senate on the night of Sept. 30 didn't include any debt-ceiling increase, so we're not sure what Rep. Yoho is talking about here.] So these are all a bunch of number games. The bottom-line is that this is an arbitrary number [Oct. 17] coming out of the White House and the Senate. That's the stuff that the American people are fed up with, because there's so much misinformation coming out of our government. That's what rattles our financial markets.¬† BI: So, your comment to the Washington Post drew some eyes, so to speak, last week. What were some of the reactions you got to those comments, both from colleagues and constituents? Did anyone straight-up call you crazy? Rep. Ted Yoho: [Laughs] Well, that's what the Washington Post said, and what got picked up is, 'Ted Yoho thinks default is good for the government and for the economy.' And that's just an outright falsity or lying. Because what I said was, not raising the debt ceiling does not automatically trigger a default. And if we address our problems, and we say, 'Brett, I owe you money ‚Äî you know I owe you money, and I'm going to pay you. I'm going to pay you with interest. But we just need a little breathing room here to reorganize our debt.' I don't know if you've ever been in business with people who have owed you money‚Ä¶ Brett LoGiurato/Business InsiderAn American flag hangs in Ted Yoho's office.BI: I have.¬† Rep. Ted Yoho: And if you had someone that owed you money, and if they were to call you up and tell you that ‚Äî instead of just trying to hunt them down, you're not going to feel better about that?¬† BI: Yeah, but I think I'd want my money.¬† Rep. Ted Yoho: Well, I think that's kind of what our creditors think.¬† BI: What would happen, for you, if we go over the deadline this week, and markets start to freak out about it? Rep. Ted Yoho: What deadline? BI: The Oct. 17 deadline. And I know you said it's arbitrary‚Äî¬† Rep. Ted Yoho: It's an arbitrary deadline. There's going to be a tomorrow. There's going to be uncertainty in the markets, but we've created that. I mean, go back to the Fiscal Cliff. That was a lot of media hype. People felt, oh, America's going to collapse. Everything's going to collapse. That was nothing more than media hype, and people on one side of the aisle saying how irresponsible this is. That day will come and go, just like 2000 did, and we're still here. And we'll still be here after Oct. 17. What people need to do is calm down and realize, again, not raising the debt ceiling will not automatically trigger a default. We're going to address our problems, and we're going to get our spending in order. This group, this Congress, is the one that's going to take this on and solve this problem so that, in six months, six weeks, or six years, we're not going to have a discussion about the continuing resolution, because we're going to get back to regular order and appropriations like we're supposed to. And we're not going to have to worry about raising a debt ceiling in this fashion again.¬† ‚Ä¶ And now, this is not a knock on you, but if the press would say, if America would address these problems as a nation ‚Äî not as Republicans and as Democrats, but as a nation ‚Äî¬†we're going to make America more competitive in the world, and the rest of the world will want to follow our lead. That's what I'm here for. My years ‚Äî if I have the privilege to serve ‚Äî¬†that's my whole thing. I don't want to be here any longer than that. I want to turn it over to somebody like you that's passionate about our country and is willing to look at the safety-net programs, our social programs, so that we can preserve those things. BI: You want to turn your seat over to me? Rep. Ted Yoho: I want to turn it over to a younger generation that is passionate about our country. BI: Are you familiar with the acronym YOLO? Rep. Ted Yoho: [Laughs] Yes. I didn't learn about it until I ran.¬† BI: There were a lot of people who made YOLO jokes about your debt-ceiling stance, considering your last name. Does it accurately describe your governing approach? Rep. Ted Yoho: I guess it depends. If it means that I have a positive attitude and I want to do everything I can to reach the maximum. It's kind of like the Marines ‚Äî¬†be all you can be. Be the best you can be at everything you do. Put your best foot forward. Make a good first impression every time you talk to somebody. Speak the truth, speak honestly, and be passionate about it. So if it's from that perspective, then I agree with it.¬† But if it's like, you only live once, and you want to get the most you can from everybody and cheat them, I'm absolutely against that. So I guess it's your perspective. BI: What has your relationship been like with Speaker Boehner so far? Rep. Ted Yoho: We say hi every time we see each other. So I get along fine with him. BI: That's good. Rep. Ted Yoho: That's the same thing I do with [Majority Leader] Eric Cantor and [Majority Whip] Kevin McCarthy. And I do the same thing with [Minority Leader Nancy] Pelosi, too.¬† BI: What seems to be kicked around by the Senate right now is the Susan Collins plan, which would implement a two-year delay in the medical device tax. Could you sup‚Äî Rep. Ted Yoho: No. Let me tell you about that medical device tax, and why we need that medical device tax repealed. America's home to about 85% of medical manufacturing in the world. If we don't repeal that, those guys are going to leave. I've got some of them in our district, and they say, we can't stay here if they don't get rid of that tax. I've got one company that, that one tax alone would cost them $22-$30 million in gross profits. And if you're like a lot of businesses here, especially in the last four or five years, you're hunting around for profits. And so, what they told me is, they're going to leave this country. They're going to go to an Asian country. And so, if we want to keep the U.S. competitive, the smart thing to do would be to repeal that tax 100%.¬† ‚Ä¶ Think of what you need today. As a businessman, you need economic certainty. On the tax policies. You need it on your regulatory policies. And you need it on ‚Ä¶ the health care thing is just a disaster if you have more than 50 employees. I hear it every day. So if we can bring that certainty to American manufacturing and say, 'We're going to repeal that tax forever. You won't have to worry about it,' those companies are going to stay here forever, and they're going to expand. If we don't do it, they're going to leave. And jobs are going to leave. It's just a real simple concept to me, and I don't understand why people argue the other way.¬† BI: What, for you, would be the ideal solution out of this? Rep. Ted Yoho: At this point ... do a continuing resolution, do a six-month delay of the Affordable Care Act, do 100% repeal of the medical-device tax, and take away the exemption for people in Congress so we're not treated any differently than anybody else in America after the six months.¬† And I would be willing to raise the debt ceiling only to cover deficit spending we did last year. And then, take everything else off the table for the next six months, and work at spending cuts ‚Äî and I don't want to call them social-program reforms, but I'll call them social-program stability. Tax reform. We need to do tax reform. I'd like to put a freeze on businesses on some regulations. ‚Ä¶ And then in six months, we need to have made progress on fixing the ills of Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid. These are changes politicians never want to make. But they are changes¬† that'll have to be made, or they're going to go broke and you're going to wake up one day, and there are going to be austerity measures placed on this country by a foreign creditor. I don't want anybody to dictate to America how to decide our lives.¬†
REUTERS/Jessica Rinaldi With the October 17 debt ceiling deadline fast approaching and uncertainty about when the Fed will begin tapering its monthly $85 billion asset purchase program, some investors are looking for safe haven to protect their wealth from rapid depreciation. But Marc Faber, author of "The Gloom Boom And Doom Report," thinks there is no safe haven. In an interview with Bloomberg TV he says investors are better off with a diversified portfolio: "There is no safe haven. Bank deposits are not safe, which used to be safe. Money in treasury bills is not 100% safe because there is inflation in the system and you hardly get any interest. Bonds are not very safe anymore because eventually interest rates will go up. Equities in the US are relatively expensive by any valuation metrics you might use. I don't see anything particularly safe. The best you can hope for is that you have a diversified portfolio of different assets and that they don't all collapse at the same time." Read the entire transcript below: Faber on gold: "We have a strong rally form the lows at 1180 to over 1400 and now we are backing off. I think between around 1200 and 1250 it is getting into buying range. The sentiment about gold is very negative, but if you look at everything considered - the monetization of debt, the debt ceiling, which sooner or later will be increased because both Republicans and Democrats are big spenders and the government's debt has expanded from $1 trillion in 1980 to $5 trillion in 1999, now we are at $16 trillion. Both Democrats and Republicans have been big, big spenders because a lot of money flows through the government." On how he sees the debt ceiling debate playing out: "If they don't agree by the 17th, I think what can happen is that the Fed will actually finance the Treasury independently so the interest payments are being met. If the interest payments are not being met, I think it will cause quite a bit disruption to the financial market. I am not that concerned about that. I think this larger issue is like the euro issue a year ago where people were very negative and it was debated and so forth. In the end it is a political decision. I think both parties want to spend. It's just on different items that they want to spend money." On whether what's going on across equities, bonds currencies and commodities, along with the events in US, can be compared to other idiocies by governments in previous decades: "Yes, idiocies by governments. That is exactly the word. It's basically a dysfunctional government that we have that is far too large that is essentially wasting money left, right and center. The Republicans are wasting money on the military complex and the Democrats are basically buying votes with transfer payments, with entitlement programs, it goes on. It is a huge waste. The problem is that I don‚Äôt see a solution. I think the current debate about the debt ceiling and the budget is more a symptom of a problem than a problem itself. The problem is really that the government, not just in the US but other countries as well, has grown disproportionally large and that retards economic growth." On whether there's a safe haven left:  "There is no safe haven. Bank deposits are not safe, which used to be safe. Money in treasury bills is not 100% safe because there is inflation in the system and you hardly get any interest. Bonds are not very safe anymore because eventually interest rates will go up. Equities in the US are relatively expensive by any valuation metrics you might use. I don't see anything particularly safe. The best you can hope for is that you have a diversified portfolio of different assets and that they don't all collapse at the same time."
abcnews.go.comGrace Groner was born in 1909 in rural Illinois. Orphaned at age 12 and never married, she began her career during the Great Depression. She became a secretary, lived in a small cottage, bought used clothes, and never owned a car. When Groner died in 2010, those close to her were shocked to learn she was worth at least $7 million. Even more amazing, she made it all on her own. The country secretary bought $180 worth of stocks in the 1930s, never sold, and let it compound into a fortune. She left it all to charity. Now meet Richard Fuscone. He attended Dartmouth and earned an MBA from the University of Chicago. Rising through the ranks of high finance, Fuscone became Executive Chairman of the Americas at Merrill Lynch. Crain's once included Fuscone in a "40 under 40" list of successful businesspeople. He retired in 2000 to "pursue personal, charitable interests." Former Merrill CEO David Komansky praised Fuscone's "business savvy, leadership skills, sound judgment and personal integrity." But Fuscone filed for bankruptcy in 2010 -- the same year Groner's fortune was revealed -- fighting to prevent foreclosure of his 18,471-square-foot, 11-bathroom, two-pool, two-elevator, seven-car-garage New York mansion. This was after selling another home in Palm Beach following a separate foreclosure. "My background is in the financial-services industry and I have been personally devastated by the financial crisis," Fuscone's bankruptcy filing allegedly stated. "I currently have no income." These stories fascinate me. There is no plausible scenario in which a 100-year-old country secretary could beat Tiger Woods at golf, or be better at brain surgery than a brain surgeon. But -- fairly often -- that same country secretary can out-finance a Wall Street titan. Money is strange like that.¬† Less bang for your buck¬†One of the most common calls after the 2008 financial crisis was for America to double down on financial literacy. "We must strive to ensure all¬†Americans have the skills to manage their fiscal resources effectively and avoid deceptive or predatory practices," President Obama wrote in 2011, calling for a new "financial literacy month." But there's a funny thing about financial literacy: There are quite a few Grace Groners and Richard Fuscones out there. They are extreme examples, but the link between financial education and financial outcomes is surprisingly elusive. A paper released last week by a trio of economists looked at 168 separate studies analyzing the effectiveness of financial literacy programs. To sum up their findings: It doesn't work.¬†The authors found "interventions to improve financial literacy explain only 0.1% of the variance in financial behaviors studied, with weaker effects in low-income samples." And what little benefit education offered vanished quickly. "Even large interventions with many hours of instruction have negligible effects on behavior 20 months or more from the time of intervention," they wrote. This is nothing new. Lauren Willis at Loyola Law School has¬†shown¬†that financial literacy programs can actually be harmful to people's financial wellbeing. High school students who took part in a financial literacy course went on have more problems with their finances than students who skipped the course. Low-income consumers who took a class on money management "were less likely to plan and set future financial goals at follow-up than they were at baselines" one year later. As Jason Zweig of The Wall Street Journal wrote, soldiers who took a financial literacy class "ended up significantly¬†less¬†likely to have systematic control over their household budgets." As Zweig bluntly put it, "there's remarkably little evidence that financial-literacy education ... works." Part of the problem here is that defining "financial literacy" and "outcomes" is more art than science. There's a tremendous amount of financial advice out there. A lot of it is bogus. And some people would rather, say, go on a nice vacation than save for retirement. That's not necessarily a bad decision. To each their own. But several studies offer a more convincing answer: Financial education programs don't improve outcomes because they tend to teach fundamental financial concepts, which aren't that important, rather than behavioral issues, which are. Knowledge doesn't equal skill¬†As Willis wrote, "financial education appears to increase confidence without improving ability, leading to worse decisions." Learning the definition of compound interest isn't going to do you much good unless you understand the devastation you'll bring to your wealth by panicking when the market drops. Knowing what a Roth IRA is won't do you much good if overconfidence entices you to take out lots of debt. These basic behavioral differences are what separate the Grace Groners from the Richard Fuscones. Groner clearly understood patience. She understood frugality. She understood the value of a long-term view and how to not panic -- if only subconsciously. Fuscone, it seems, didn't. (To be fair, it's unclear exactly where his financial troubles came from.)¬† The traits most important to mastering your finances aren't typically taught in finance courses. You're more likely to see them in a psychology class. They include things like patience, an even temper, being skeptical of salesmen, and avoiding over-optimism.¬†A lot of people miss this because it's not intuitive. But I think it explains, better than anything else, why so many people are bad with their money.¬†And it extends beyond novices. The majority of highly educated, well-trained investment professionals perform abysmally. This has little to do with their understanding of finance and lots to do with the inability to control their emotions and behaviors.¬† Financial literacy is important. We should continue to push it. But it has to be coupled with a better understanding of the behavioral flaws that actually cause people to make bad decisions with their money. Until this is accepted, we will have more¬†Richard Fuscones and fewer¬†Grace Groners.
Brett LoGiurato/Business InsiderTRENTON, Fla. ó†Casey Mitchell points them out, one by one.† "There are seven people packing that I see right now," Mitchell says. Mitchell is standing on the Trenton High side of a rivalry high school football game with Chiefland High. When Mitchell says "packing," he means that they are carrying guns. One ... two ... three ... four ... "Actually, not sure about that one," he says. He finds a seventh one anyway.† The point, Mitchell tries to make repeatedly to a reporter from New York, is that what would be crazy to people in New York isn't crazy in Florida. Mitchell is a constituent of Rep. Ted Yoho (R-Fla.), who has made waves as a freshman congressman for saying things that are deemed controversial.† Yoho's latest questionable remark is on the issue of the debt ceiling, which he doesn't think should be raised because of a belief that hitting it would "bring stability to world markets."†Economists in New York and elsewhere feel differently about that. The Treasury Department has warned of economic calamity rivaling anything outside of the Great Depression. "Again, the tsunami is the debt ceiling debate," Yoho said in an interview. "And you saw where I stand on that. Not raising the debt ceiling is not an automatic trigger for a default.  "I want to say that again, so you get it right. Not raising the debt ceiling is not an automatic trigger for default." When you talk to his constituents, it's not hard to understand where those feelings come from. The vast majority of those in Yoho's district ó one that is heavily rural and conservative outside of the liberal Gainesville and blue Alachua County ó are driven by the belief that the nation's debt is out of control. Some are to the "right" of Yoho ó they believe the nation should have to balance its budget and that the debt ceiling should never have to be raised again. APRep. Ted Yoho, when he was sworn into Congress.Some are to the "left" ó though they are aware that failing to raise the nation's $16.7 trillion debt ceiling could bring economic calamity, they believe that the mentality of "kicking the can down the road" will only delay the inevitable doom of a piling-up national debt. Better to get it out of the way now. Many are united, though, in their steadfastness against increasing the nation's borrowing limit, whatever the reason. Mitchell, for one, is an example of how strongly the residents of North Central Florida feel about the ongoing fiscal debates in Washington. He is a livestock inspector for the U.S. Department of Agriculture. He is furloughed from his job because of the federal government shutdown. If Monday comes and goes without a resolution, he'll miss a paycheck. And if Republicans get some kind of concession in a deal that really addresses spending, Mitchell says it will have been worth it. "We need to break the cycle of dependency on government," Mitchell said. "We are enslaving people. There are three generations ... that have been enslaved by the government. There's almost no going back." --- In a crowd of hundreds of people at the biggest high school rivalry game in the area, it takes about 15 people to find a detractor. One of them is John, a retired school administrator who didn't want to give his last name.† "There are poor old ladies who are worried about their Social Security checks," he said, adding that he's also worried about his own check. "We need to get this over with." John voted for Ted Yoho in the 2012 election. A lot of people in Yoho's district voted for him ó he won the general election by a landslide after pulling off a huge upset of 24-year incumbent Republican Rep. Cliff Stearns in the primary. Part of the reason that Yoho made waves on the national scene and shocked Stearns in the primary is due to his average, everyman reputation and the fact that, being in the community for 20-plus years as a large-animal veterinarian, he knows a lot of people. Yoho doesn't practice anymore ó but sometimes, when a patient comes calling, he'll still do a favor. Kat Cammack, Yoho's chief of staff, says he'll occasionally still be fresh off a flight into Gainesville, in Washington-clad suit and tie, when he'll get a call from someone asking if he just has a couple seconds to take a look at a minor problem with one of their animals.† He almost always has a couple seconds. This is the type of personality that won Yoho a seat in Congress. But once in a while, people like John wish Yoho would just say†no. John is a registered Republican, and he's worried about the future of the Republican Party beyond Florida's District 3. "Find another way. Win elections," John said. "If you keep going like this, you're not going to win one for a long time." --- Therein lies the problem. As Jeremiah Tattersall exasperatedly puts it, Yoho is living in an echo chamber with people just like him. That's what happens when you win a district drawn in such a way that you win 65% of the vote. "You answer to birthers. You answer to people who seriously believe you're like Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks and would be standing next to them," said Tattersall, a†field staff†of the North Central Florida Central Labor Council, a group that opposes Yoho and often demonstrates against him. "And you answer to people who don't believe the debt ceiling is a real thing." Tattersall is right. If you walk up to 20 people at random at various points in this district, there's a good chance that at least 15 will appreciate the fight in which Yoho is participating on their behalf in Washington. The economists' warnings, the temporary Wall Street freak outs ó nothing has tempered their willingness to engage in this battle. Why aren't you concerned about defaulting? "The people who are saying that are using scare tactics," said Todd Newtown, the clerk of the Circuit Court in Trenton.† It's almost a unanimous consensus among economists. "Well, sure, the Ivy League liberals ..." Brett LoGiurato/Business InsiderCaroline VickersThere are more than a few Republicans and conservatives who agree that breaching the debt ceiling and risking default would be dangerous, no? "I think they've bought into the scare tactics." Brainwashed? "Sure, brainwashed." Conversations like these are aplenty.† What do you think would happen if we breach the debt ceiling? "I think it would be like the opposite of the bailout of GM," said Caroline Vickers, a Trenton resident, referring to the auto industry bailout of 2008 and 2009. "We shouldn't have done that. If you make poor decisions, you have to suffer the consequences." "We stop borrowing now, and start spending with what we have," added David Biddle, a state committeeman in the Florida GOP. He theorized that there is enough revenue coming in every day that it would force Washington to make tough spending choices on the fly. "There's a scare tactic out there that if we breach the debt ceiling and default, there's just no more money coming in, and that's just not the case," Biddle said. "There's money to be allocated different ways. And maybe you have to make some cuts somewhere that might not make everybody happy, but at some point, you have to say, enough is enough." So what can we cut? Social Security? Medicare? Those are the big, long-term problems on our docket. "No one's going to cut Social Security or Medicare. That's another scare tactic," Biddle said. So what can we cut now?† "You can start with foreign aid. Cut that out. You can cut, you know, federal arts ..." Biddle said.† "There are a lot of grants," adds Bob Clemons, a director of finance for the local school board. "Grants. There's a lot of grants," Biddle confirms. There's a pause for about 10 seconds. "It's a big problem," Clemons said.† "It is. It is," Biddle said. Biddle comes back a little while later. He says that the government shutdown has helped show that there can be significant cuts in the federal workforce. "There are no non-essential employees in the private sector," he said. Laurie Newsom, the president of the Gainesville Tea Party and a small-business owner, has a four-point plan to cut spending.† One: Get rid of the Department of Education and Environmental Protection Agency. States can take over those functions and have the ability to regulate their environmental practices, she said. Two: Get rid of the Federal Communications Commission. Three: There are a few little things that can be cut, such as cutting some funding for the National Institutes of Health and the CDC's tracking of flu season. Fourth is the big one: Get rid of Obamacare. This would, in the short term, increase the deficit, but Newsom thinks it would be worth it for the economic growth and certainty it would provide small businesses. "Now, a lot of people will say, this is a pipe dream," she said. "Well, I don't think it is. ... And if we don't have some sort of leverage, like the debt ceiling, it's not going to happen." -- Brett LoGiurato/Business InsiderAt a Gainesville, Fla., Starbucks coffee shop, a man performs the audacious duty of signing a petition.† The petition is the second in a recent series from Starbucks, which urges those in Washington to proverbially "Come Together" and compromise on a solution that won't screw up a still-fragile but recovering economy.† Thirty-one others, so far, have signed this petition. Why? Why sign a petition in Gainesville, Fla., on the eve of crisis ó one that has virtually no chance of reaching his representative, let alone Congress as a whole? "They need to do something about this," said the man, who also only wanted to be known as John for this story.† John, a retired former mechanic, is a registered Republican who voted for Ted Yoho. He supports the fight Yoho is carrying on. And despite his empty plea on the petition, the ultimate solution he supports is one that doesn't involve a lot of coming together. "The only thing I'll say is that I don't like that Obamacare," he said.†

Amazing but true factoid via FactSet Research: During the past week, the blended earnings growth rate for the S&amp;P 500 declined by 2.0 percentage points (from 2.8% on October 4 to 0.8% today), and the growth rate for the Financials sector fell by more than 12 percentage points (from 8.9% on October 4 to -3.5% today. JPMorgan Chase is the largest contributor to the decline in both earnings growth rates this past week, as the company reported actual EPS of -$0.17 (including a legal expense of $1.85) for the third quarter, compared to the mean EPS estimate of $1.19. If this company is excluded, the earnings growth rate for the S&amp;P 500 would improve to 3.3%, and the earnings growth rate for the Financials sector would improve to 12.4%.

blogs.cfainstitute.orgThis is my most cherished possession. And here are some of the most interesting things you can find in it. The Enron collapse now seems like a distant memory, and its scale is so tiny compared to the 2008ñ09 financial crisis that it almost feels like it wasnít really that bad. But it was. First, letís review some facts: At one point, Enron was the sixth-largest energy company in the world. Enron shares peaked at $90.75 in August 2000 (one month after Code of Ethics was published). Shares dropped to $0.67 by January 2002.In November 2001, it was revealed that Enron had overstated its earnings by several hundred million dollars.Many directors sold their stock before this time, while 401(k) savers were prevented from selling (and subsequently lost their life savings).In 2001, Enronís 140 top executives were paid a total of $680 million. Kenneth Lay was pad $67.4 million and Jeffrey Skilling received $41.8 million. The foreword by Kenneth Lay: ìWe want to be proud of Enron and to know that it enjoys a reputation for fairness and honesty and that it is respected.î blogs.cfainstitute.org Securities trades by company personnel: It is baffling to read the below page on trading, which says that no one in Enron could trade in Enron or related stock. Enron actually had a live stock price of Enron in the elevators. Almost every single employee appeared to trade in Enron and related stocks. Hereís a brief write-up of some of the 29 directors who dumped stock before the facts came out and the stock tanked, from The New York Times: Mr. Lay himself sold Enron stock 350 times, trading almost daily, receiving $101.3 million. In all, Mr. Lay sold 1.8 million Enron shares between early 1999 and July 2001, five months before Enron filed for bankruptcy. As of [February 2001], he still owned more than 7.7 million shares. Mr. Lay sold his stock for $31 to $86 a share; [in January 2002], Enron was selling for under 70 cents a share. Often, Mr. Lay sold in amounts as small as 500 shares, while at other times he sold as many as 100,000 shares. It has not been determined how much Mr. Lay or the others paid for their shares, or how much they gained. Much of Mr. Layís holdings, and those of other executives, were in the form of stock options, which allowed them to buy shares at a discount. Other top sellers were Lou L. Pai, the former chairman of an Enron subsidiary, who received $353.7 million for his 5 million shares; Rebecca P. Mark-Jusbasche, a director and former Enron executive who received $79.5 million for 1.4 million shares; and Ken L. Harrison, a director who sold 1 million shares for $75.2 million. Jeffrey K. Skilling, the companyís former chief executive, received $66.9 million for 1.1 million shares. Beginning in December 2000, Mr. Skilling began to sell his holdings at a pace of 10,000 shares about every seven days. He still owns about 600,000 shares and options, according to public filings. Andrew S. Fastow, the companyís ousted chief financial officer, who set up many of the financial partnerships that have been criticized for concealing Enronís large debts, received $30 million for his holdings. blogs.cfainstitute.org   blogs.cfainstitute.org  blogs.cfainstitute.org Limits of expectations of privacy There are many memorable moments from the Enron saga, but one stands out as the very worst: the ìburn, baby, burnî quote in the conversation between two traders. But they should have known better than to have such a conversation over the phone. After all, it sad so in their ethics guide. Before you listen to the recording, here is some background information from WSWS: Enron Corporation deliberately created real and imaginary shortages during the 2000ñ2001 California energy crisis, in order drive up prices and reap vast profits in the stateís newly deregulated energy market. Internal memos from the now bankrupt company outline the various schemes Enron executives used to defraud officials running the stateís power grid, manipulate energy supplies and literally loot the state treasury of billions of dollars. Throughout this period Enron enjoyed the closest political ties with the Bush White House, which rejected appeals from California officials for federal intervention and the imposition of price caps. And the now infamous voice recording.

BofA Merrill Lynch European Investment Strategy, EPFR The chart above shows the extent of what has become an amazing development in global markets in 2013: favor has turned toward European equities in a big way after years of what have mostly been outflows from the asset class. This summer, economic data in the eurozone began to turn up, and the euro-area economy finally rose out of the recession it had been stuck in since 2011. Investors were quick to pile into European stocks. Now, we're even seeing banks recommending clients rotate out of U.S. equities and into their European counterparts, as Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale asset allocation strategists did in a bearish call on U.S. stocks last week. In a note to clients, BofA Merrill Lynch investment strategists led by John Bilton sum up their views toward the Europe trade at the moment: Europe is everybody‚Äôs darling, but is the honeymoon over? 15 weeks of inflows to Europe is the best winning streak in 11 years. PMs we‚Äôve met in the past month are more constructive than we‚Äôve seen them since the start of the crisis. ‚ÄúLong Europe‚Äù is popular, but it may be more a verbal consensus than a practical one ‚Äì real money is just starting to buy, only 1/7th of cumulative outflows since 07 have reversed, and many investors are wanting to call the top.  Despite the flows a drop in event risk may push SX5E &gt;3000  We are mindful of how far prices, flow and sentiment have run. We also note that indices can see ‚Äòblow off tops‚Äô, especially when PMs start to try and fade strength. Resolution of the US shutdown and debt ceiling debate, or good earnings data from EU firms this week, could push SX5E &gt;3000 for the first time since May-11.  But 3Q &amp; 4Q remain the ‚Äòshow me‚Äô quarters for EU earnings  We remain structural bulls on Europe but do acknowledge that all of the 45% rally in SX5E since Jun-2012 lows is from rerating. The next two earnings seasons are Europe‚Äôs ‚Äòshow me‚Äô quarters. Steep yield curves, easing working capital financing, low inventories and rising utilisation rates should kickstart a restocking cycle, in turn boosting EPS. Firms that disappoint in this environment will be vulnerable.  US drives near term move; EU earnings sets long term trend  The US shutdown remains in focus; markets will be sensitive in both directions to newsflow. VIX is back to pre-shutdown levels so nervous PMs will find put options less painful to carry. EPS revisions still favour domestic EU and financials; while staples, industrials and chems may be vulnerable as EU earnings season begins. The Euro Stoxx 50 (SX5E) has risen 18.5% since June 24.
REUTERS/Adnan AbidiThe Indian economy has been struggling to grow thanks a tumbling currency and surging food and energy prices. Besides slowing growth, many have been watching two data points keenly. The first is the nation's current account deficit, currently at -5.07% of GDP. The other is its external debt which stands at 22% of GDP. The current account deficit ballooned because of the nation's gold and oil imports. And some think this is bound to get worse. "As liquidity is expected to moderate, funds have been flowing back to the developed world from most emerging markets," writes Societe Generale's Patrick Legland.† "This reversal of flow is further exacerbating the problem with the INR depreciating sharply, causing higher imported inflation and rising input costs, which are proving to be a massive blow to already waning growth." India's central bank governor, Raghuram Rajan, said India has a reserve of $280 billion which is 15% of its GDP. "The country can pay three-fourth of its debt from its Forex reserves," First Post cites him saying.†  "We bought over $60 billion dollar gold last year. $60 billion accounts for three-fourth of our current account deficit," he said. "If the push comes to shove, we can pay the world in gold." Rajan also said that India will not approach the IMF for financing in the next five years, adding that countries only go the IMF when they are "desperate." Dennis Gartman, of The Gartman Letter wrote that Rajan's comments along with heavy trading volume on Friday, unleashed a "powerful storm of selling." Gartman writes that while, gold bugs think this is "central bank manipulation at work,' "from our vantage point, this selling looked like massive margin call liquidation that was forced." He writes that life for gold bugs is "getting tiresome."
REUTERS/Joshua RobertsU.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew.Fiscal battles in Washington D.C. over raising the debt ceiling continue to be the primary focus of market participants this week. October 17 is the day that the Treasury has said it will hit its borrowing limit, but it won't run out of cash for a few more weeks even if there is no deal by then. In a note to clients, BofA Merrill Lynch interest rate strategist Marcus Huie says November 15 is probably the real drop-dead date for the Treasury, at which point it would have to default on short-term obligations: As of Tuesday, 8 October, the Treasury had $32bn of cash balance and $92bn in debt maneuver capacity, according to our estimates. The sum of these two, $124bn, reflects the actual payment capacity of the government. The Treasury can shift funds between the cash balance and debt maneuver capacity by issuing cash management bills or shrinking/raising regular bill sizes, within the overall payment capacity.  October 17 is the date specified by the Treasury that the debt capacity will run out. However, we do not attach any importance to this date, as payment capacity will still be $70bn, according to our estimates. But the date maintains symbolic and political importance for the negotiators, so the passage of this date without a deal would likely be met by a risk-off trade.  Also, after this date, all coupon bond auctions would likely be deferred in favour of rolling cash management bills, with the announcement of the 30y TIPS reopening on this date the initial test case.  Over the following several weeks, payment capacity drops gradually to $22bn on October 31, still enough to pay the $6bn coupon and roll over the bills maturing on this date, according to our estimates. November 1 is when payment capacity runs out, due to large Social Security, Medicare, defense, and veterans payments of around $67bn. We project that only half the payments on this date can be made. It is very unlikely that the Treasury will be able to pay all its obligations on time on or past this date. However, it is conceivable that bills maturing after Nov 1 can still be rolled over with new issuance, since the effective interest that needs to be paid every week is around $10mn, a rounding error in budget terms. November 15 is when the Treasury would theoretically almost certainly default on its debt, if no debt limit deal is reached by then, since the coupon payment of $31bn is exceptionally large. "There is still some uncertainty to our forecasts, but so far, the daily cash flows would tend to cause an extension of the deadlines, given the effect of the shutdown that has reduced expected federal outlays by about $2bn per day," says Huie. "One uncertainty is the purchase of Treasuries for the highway trust fund on Oct 15, but we do not expect it to be large enough to make a difference to the crucial Nov 1 and Nov 15 deadlines."

Flickr/andersabrahamssonThey‚Äôve earned it. They‚Äôve saved it. And there it sits‚Äîa big pile of money in their savings accounts. At least that was the case with a handful of high-earning women I interviewed. Single, cohabitating, East Coast, West Coast ‚Ä¶ and they all had one thing in common: They were sitting on sizable nest eggs that were earning a paltry 1% or so. And for various reasons‚Äîranging from fear to self-described ‚Äúparalysis‚Äù‚Äîthey were reluctant to invest it in the stock market. It‚Äôs a disconcerting phenomenon that I‚Äôve dubbed the ‚Äúsit-it-out syndrome.‚Äù If this were a Jane Austen novel, my fair heroines would be perched on the sidelines, clutching their reticules, while the ball went on without them.¬†Ironically, in 2013, they‚Äôre VPs at ad agencies, marketing execs at Fortune 500 companies and middle-school teachers who‚Äôve perfected the study of saving. In fact, they‚Äôre part of the nearly one in four American women who are¬†bringing home the bigger paycheck, but according to what they told me‚Äîand what recent research backs up‚Äîonce they amass a nice sum of money, they don‚Äôt know quite what to do next. Is the sit-it-out syndrome a hangover from the Great Recession, or did we all watch too much Mad Men and internalize retro relationship roles? It may be a little bit of both: A recent Fidelity study that we‚Äôll explore shows that fewer women than ever feel confident about wielding control of their own purse strings. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got $75,000 sitting in a savings account,‚Äù says Diane England*, 38, a VP at an advertising agency in Manhattan. ‚ÄúI know I could get more return investing, but I don‚Äôt know where to begin.¬†I am frozen by my lack of knowledge and my insecurity that, at my age and income bracket, I should have a clue.‚Äù RELATED: Could You Be a Victim of the Ostrich Effect? England, who‚Äôs single, isn‚Äôt saving for anything in particular, except maybe a down payment on a future beach house. ‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs not really why I hesitate,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs more out of insecurity and feeling overwhelmed.‚Äù Some woman say that not getting involved in the stock market actually provides them with more peace of mind. Take Sejal Patel*, a senior marketing executive at a blue chip pharmaceutical company who just turned 40. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always maxed out my 401(k), but that‚Äôs about it,‚Äù Patel says. ‚ÄúI have a quarter of a million dollars in a savings account, earning the proverbial 1%. My parents think I‚Äôm ridiculous for sitting on this amount of cash, having done nothing with it.‚Äù In fact, after a decade of nagging, she finally gave her dad the password to her old 401(k)‚Äîwhere, she says, he was aghast to find another $85,000 sitting in an IRA, uninvested. ‚ÄúThey asked, at a minimum, if I would at least do something with that,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúAnd literally two weeks ago I agreed.‚Äù RELATED: 9 Things People Don‚Äôt Do With Their Retirement Accounts But Should ‚ÄúI have a quarter of a million dollars in a savings account, earning the proverbial 1%. My parents think I‚Äôm ridiculous for sitting on this amount of cash.‚Äù While, Patel, who has no dependents, is arguably part of the 1%, she views keeping her nest egg earning 1% as a way to protect against a seriously rainy day. ‚ÄúI see other mostly young, single women who either don‚Äôt have anyone advising them or, like me, feel scared,‚Äù she explains. ‚ÄúWe live in uncertain times of re-orgs, collapsing banks, and the highest number of unemployed peers I thought I would ever see‚Äîyou just never know where you‚Äôll be, and you need a good plan B.‚Äù And why is she against potentially earning more on a portion of her cushion? In a word: fear. ‚ÄúThe idea that I will somehow lose all of my savings at a time when I really need it,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúAs a single person you have no second income to fall back on, and who wants to be 40 and ask their parents for a loan?‚Äù It seems that it‚Äôs not just single women who pale at the thought of managing their own portfolios. Every two years Fidelity publishes the results of its ‚ÄúCouples Retirement Study.‚Äù This year‚Äôs analysis, released in September 2013, showed that while women are growing increasingly comfortable handling day-to-day financial decisions, more women than ever are handing the reins to their partners when it comes to investing. Disconcertingly, the younger the respondent, the more likely she was to feel unqualified to manage her own investments. ‚ÄúWe did see young women playing a less active role in retirement decisions,‚Äù says Lauren Brouhard, senior vice president of Retirement at Fidelity Investments. While one in four Boomer women identified themselves as the primary financial decision-maker in a relationship, she says, only 12% of Gen Y did.¬†The majority of women in the study also said that they had more confidence in a spouse to assume control of the finances, and they most frequently chalked it up to the fact that ‚Äúhe‚Äôs better with numbers.‚Äù ‚ÄúAt the end of the day, it boils down to a crisis of confidence for women,‚Äù Brouhard says. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre more likely than men to doubt their ability to handle the responsibility for their financial futures. We think it‚Äôs a little ironic that women‚Äôs interest in financial planning is still low given their growing earning potential.‚Äù RELATED: ‚ÄúI Make Less Than My Wife‚Äù: How 3 Real Men Feel About It And Brouhard notes, it‚Äôs especially important for women to be savvy because, on average, they tend to outlive male spouses by at least five years‚Äîand there‚Äôs that one in two odds of getting divorced. ‚ÄúWe know that there‚Äôs a really high likelihood that women will need to take control of their finances at some point,‚Äù she says. RELATED:¬†Why Retirement Is Harder for Women Of course, not all women fit the sit-it-out profile. And shying away from investing doesn‚Äôt always equate with a lack of interest. Rather, among these would-be female investors, there‚Äôs widespread confusion about just how to get started. Take Jenna Megalizzi, a 36-year-old seventh-grade science teacher based in Berkeley, Calif. ‚ÄúWe were three couples, sitting around a lake on Labor Day weekend, and we started talking about investing,‚Äù Megalizzi recalls. ‚ÄúI was saying, ‚ÄòI have about five friends who are lawyers, but all I want is a friend who‚Äôs a financial planner because I have no understanding of how to wisely invest my money.‚Äô¬†I haven‚Äôt invested because I don‚Äôt understand the system, and I‚Äôm concerned about risk. I want someone to take me by the hand and guide me.‚Äù And her boyfriend, she adds, ‚Äúis even more clueless than I am.‚Äù So should everyone have his or her money in the market? Not necessarily, says Brandie Farnam, a certified financial planner‚Ñ¢ with LearnVest Planning Services, who adds that there¬†are certain questions you need to ask yourself before deciding whether you‚Äôre ready to take any of your savings for a whirl. ‚ÄúWhat I generally tell clients is that before you consider investing, make sure you have a fully funded six months of emergency savings, and that you are maxing out your retirement accounts,‚Äù Farnam says. And it goes without saying that you should first pay down any high-interest credit card debt too. RELATED: The Best Gift I Ever Got: How I Turned One $45 Stock Into $60,000 The other factor to consider? Your time horizon‚Äîi.e., when you expect that you‚Äôll want the money. ‚ÄúWith a goal like retirement, you may have 30-plus years until you need your money back,‚Äù she explains. ‚ÄúIf you want to buy a home in five years or less, you may not want to invest the money for that goal.‚Äù But, she says, if you‚Äôve checked all of the boxes above, you may want to consider investing as a means of growing your money. ‚ÄúThe problem with earning 1% is that inflation grows at 3%,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúYour money needs to grow faster than inflation. Generally speaking, markets have averaged 7% per year. At that rate, every 10 years, your account should be doubling.‚Äù As for the fear that plagues so many sit-it-outers, Farnam says it‚Äôs common‚Äîbut usually unfounded. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a matter of taking a calculated risk, and finding that balance of being able to sleep at night,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIf you put your money in one hot stock, you stand a very good chance of losing it. But if you find a moderate mix of investments that‚Äôs appropriate for your time horizon, you can say, ‚ÄòOK, I‚Äôm going to put this money to work.‚Äô ‚Äù Attorney Heather Victor*, 44, has been working with a financial planner since she landed her ‚Äúfirst adult job,‚Äù making $28,000. ‚ÄúIt was the best move I made,‚Äù Victor says. ‚ÄúSince then, I‚Äôve always met with a financial planner on a quarterly basis.‚Äù RELATED: 5 Red Flags When Choosing a Financial Planner And even though her planners have come and gone, Victor has learned how to build a portfolio that she‚Äôs proud of. ‚ÄúSometimes the planner will throw out terms that mean nothing to me. It‚Äôs like when a sommelier goes through a detailed description of a fancy wine, and I say, ‚ÄòCan you just give me a red wine that doesn‚Äôt taste crappy?‚Äô ‚Äù she explains. ‚ÄúI found that the best thing to do was to explain what my goals were, and where I wanted to invest‚Äîand then have the planner explain the terms to me simply.‚Äù Indeed, Fidelity‚Äôs research shows that women who face their fears about getting involved in the market tend to be better investors than men.¬†‚ÄùThey‚Äôre better planners, they tend to stay the course once invested, and they tend to take on less risk, so there‚Äôs lots of evidence that they‚Äôre doing very well,‚Äù says Brouhard. ‚ÄúWe want to see that confidence spread.‚Äù *Indicated name has been changed.

Goldman Sachs Survey of 2,000 US consumersThe spread between economic optimism in high-income households and that in low-income households widened to the highest level in the history of Goldman's survey in Q3.A quarterly survey of 2,000 U.S. consumers by Goldman Sachs analysts shows that†"the bifurcation between the high and low end continues to widen" in America. "Consumers in $90,000+ households saw increased†levels of optimism, while consumers in under-$50,000 households declined," write Goldman analysts Michael Kelter, Ivan Holman, and Harsh Aneja in a new report. "This is, in fact, the widest spread we have seen between these two income groups in our survey." And according to the survey, it's not just economic optimism that is diverging across income groups: actual spending patterns are as well. Goldman Sachs survey of 2,000 US consumers"The total number of consumers who said they spent more in the past three months did tick up in our 3Q survey," say Kelter, Holman, and Aneja. "However, the bifurcation of high vs. low-mid income consumers is clearly evident. Consumers in $90,000+ households reported an increase in spending in 3Q vs. 2Q, while consumers in under-$50,000 households reported a decrease in spending this quarter." Goldman blames tax hikes that went into effect at the beginning of the year for the continued divergence between low- and high-income earners. "In our survey 61% of consumers†indicated that they noticed the impact of higher payroll taxes on their paycheck," say the Goldman analysts. "Of those, 42% indicated that they are therefore reducing spending vs. 19% who continue to spend at previous levels." Those tax hikes disproportionately fell on spending in low- and mid-income households, who were not buoyed by the "wealth effect" in the same way high-income households were. "In our view, one of the reasons why high income consumers are likely less affected by the 2013 tax increases is the wealth effect, a dynamic that disproportionately impacts high income groups," say Kelter, Holman, and Aneja. "90% of consumers with over $70,000 of income own their own home, while only 50% of those under $70,000 do. And for those with over $90,000 of household income relative to those with under $50,000 of household income, (1) almost 3x as many currently believe the value of their home is rising, and (2) 3x as many specifically say they are comfortable spending because asset prices are rising." The analysts estimate the tax hikes reduced disposable personal-income growth this year to 1-2% versus the 3-4% growth rate American households would have likely seen without the tax hikes. However, given positive underlying fundamentals for income growth, they expect it to bounce back next year: Looking at the math behind the 2013 tax increases ñ Roughly $200mn of incremental taxes hit consumers starting in Jan 2013. The payroll tax hike in particular amounted to $125bn, 60-65% of the total tax increase for the year. This $200mn compares to roughly $400-500mn of Disposable Personal Income (DPI) growth in a typical year of late. As such, the 2013 tax increases depressed DPI growth from 3-4% down to 1-2% in 2013. To the positive, once we lap the tax increases starting in 2014, Goldman Sachs economists forecast a rebound back to 3-4% DPI growth. Underlying DPI fundamentals appear strong ñ When we look at the other two primary components of Disposable Personal Income, jobs growth and wage growth, both seem relatively healthy. Jobs creation remains in the 100,000-200,000/month range, inline with the run rate of the last few years and of the expansionary mid 2000ís period. Wage growth remains depressed in absolutes, running in the +2% range, but has inflected and appears to be headed in the right direction for the first time in years. Goldman economists predict 2014 is the year U.S. economic growth will finally take off after years of disappointing recovery in the wake of the financial crisis.
Google Images"The Exorcist" was released in 1973.When people talk about the U.S. shale boom making the U.S. "energy independent," they are indirectly referring to 1973. Forty years ago Wednesday, Arab states cut off exports to the U.S. and curbed overall production. That winter,†the U.S. was basically brought to a standstill. The shock caused, among other things, Congress to ban the export of raw crude stocks in 1975. We've previously discussed why energy independence†is largely a myth: the U.S. has spent the past several decades diversifying where it sources its energy. It's also undesirable, since, in theory, this diversification shields us from oil price shocks. In an op-ed for the FT, Citi's Ed Morse acknowledges†all this. But he says allowing crude exports would vanquish the ghost of 1973 once and for all. US energy independence does not ever require the US becomes a net oil-exporting country. But it does mean that a more secure US and global energy system needs freedom to export and import as the market warrants. That means removing barriers to exporting crude oil that have been in place for decades. Freedom to buy and sell would lower crude and gasoline prices globally. It would reinforce todayís flood of investments into US oil and gas, as one of the only places on the planet largely secure from government intervention. Given that President Obama has not even allowed the final leg of the Keystone XL Pipeline, which would technically be bringing more crude into the country, to go forward, it's unlikely the ban will get lifted †anytime soon.† But we are already exporting record amounts of oil products, which are not covered by the 1975 bar, and that's helped narrow our trade deficit.† And the list of†independent†analysts†of analysts who've called for ending the moratorium keeps growing.

REUTERS/Leonhard FoegerWe love to track the daily ups and downs of the gold market and debate whether or not the yellow metal actually has any intrinsic value. But whether you like it or not, gold plays a major role in the global economy. A new report titled "The Direct Economic Impact of Gold" from PricewaterhouseCoopers (commissioned by the World Gold Council) takes a look at the mechanics of the gold trade. "The key metrics are GVA ‚Äì which measures the economic contribution of those entities engaged in the gold value chain and reflects their contribution to the economies in which they operate ‚Äì and employment," according to the report. "GVA is used because it measures the value of an activity in a way which lends itself to direct comparison with Gross Domestic Product, which is used worldwide to measure economies‚Äô economic output." Here are the 12 key takeaways from the report:
Seventeen year-old Canadian high school student Julian Marchese bought his first stock when he was only eight years-old.¬† These days he's passionate about global macro trading and he's garnering attention in the space from more seasoned macro traders.¬† "The breadth and depth of Julian's market knowledge is that of a seasoned macro trader. The young man is very impressive," one New York-based macro trader commented.¬† You can tell just by reading his trade journals. They read like a trader with at least twenty years experience wrote them, not a high schooler.¬† What's even more impressive about Marchese, who runs Marchese Financial, is that he's self-taught. Neither of his parents work in finance. He does, however, have a mentor who is one of the top ten hedge fund managers alive. Marchese wishes to keep the name of his contact private, though.¬† We caught up with him over the telephone.¬†We've transcribed our interview below. ¬†(Note: It has been lightly edited.)¬† BI: First off, tell us how you got interested in the markets and how long you've been trading.¬† JM: I first got started into investing when I was 8 years-old. I was always interested in business. You know, I did like lemonade stands. When I was 8 years-old I came to this point, 'OK, I have this money. What do I do with it?' So I went on Google and I searched for stuff to do with excess money and investing came up. It kind of intrigued me how you could invest your money, build your wealth and dreams while also helping others because through investing of course you're giving another entity capital and they can do whatever they so please to do with it and they could build their capital. Investing is what intrigued me and I kind of ran with it for the next couple of years with my life until I realized you know what I don't want to be buying stock and holding for five years ¬†waiting that long. I wanted to make money right now. That's when I got into day trading...¬† BI: I've read some of your trade journals. I see that you run quant studies on the market and that you do a lot of relative strength work. I also see that you talk about the ECB meetings and the impact on currency. This is really sophisticated stuff and it reads as if you've been trading for twenty years. You've learned all this by 17, I'm just curious how? Are you self-taught? Or has someone helped you? JM: I'm basically self-taught. A lot of people think there was someone either really close to me like either family or friend that kind of guided me. There really wasn't. I recognized an interest in this type of stuff. With the Internet nowadays, there's so much information that you can find. I just asked questions into Google and all the answers I could find were there. It also had a lot of do with experience. I mean when I wanted to test something out, I would just watch the market and I would test my idea and just write notes about it. Over time, doing that constantly over and over again it just became habit.¬† BI: Do you have a mentor?¬† JM: I kind of do. I've been able to connect with one of the top-ten hedge fund managers alive today. I mean I can't issue any names. I just made a personal promise.¬† BI: So we would recognize the person, obviously?¬† JM: Yes. BI: Any hints? What kind of strategy they have?¬† JM: It's a macro.¬† BI: How about your family? What sort of influence has your family had on you? And how important is their support? JM:¬†I definitely wouldn't be here today without their support. Trading, especially when you're a teenager, there's a lot of ups and downs, a lot of learning curves. Obviously in my early years, when I was trying to find out all this new information, when I was trying to find that Holy Grail, it took a lot of searching and my parents they allowed me to do that. They allowed me to find my way I guess. Their emotional support and their overall support for doing what I love to do has enabled me to connect with all these people to learn everything I've been able to learn and hopefully make a bigger impact with regards to financial transparency and education.¬† BI: This also seems to play into trader psychology. How important is it to have your mentor and a team around you to help you trade? JM: It's extremely important. I believe you can only get to a certain point on your own. You do need to have people around you that can give you another perspective. Especially when you're trading and you're focused in and you're finding your entry points and you're looking for your new trading opportunity you can miss a lot of things. The amount of information just to make one of three decisions‚Äîbuy, sell, hold‚Äîthe amount of information out there is out there is spectacular, so you need to have other people to bounce your ideas off of to check out what they're doing and what their views of the market are.¬† BI: What do you think is the biggest myth young people have about the markets?¬† JM: I would say the biggest myth is people think it's a casino, it's gambling. At least, that's what I get from the kids at school where I go to high school. Most of them respect what I do, but at the same time it's like I guess the media has warped the view of Wall Street. Of course, there's a lot of negativity in the press with regards to insider trading scandals and all that and that kind of warps the view of everyone else. I would say the biggest myth is that it's a casino, that it's gambling. In my view, of course, it's educated gambling. Obviously, you can't be right on every trade, but you can put the odds in your favor.¬† BI: In your experience, has there been a major lesson that you've learned? Have you had a day where you're like 'Oh my gosh, I made a huge screw up trading'?¬† JM: I would say early in my career, the biggest lesson I've ever learned (it wasn't just a one day thing it was over a couple weeks) is just never get attached to a trade. That's the biggest thing. Getting attached to a position over night, it's very psychological. It can make you do a lot of other traps that traders go into, which is adding to a loser, letting your losses run, maybe cutting your winners too short. Now, a trade always for me is my biggest problem is that early on I'd find a great trade idea and it looks perfect. Of course, it's never 100%. But I would basically trade it like it was a sure thing. The problem with that is that when it starts going against you...it looks even more attractive. The¬†price is going down so you can buy lower. So I think the biggest lesson is exactly that. Just never get attached to a position. There's always another opportunity to get in it. Just cut your losses when it hits your stop outpoint and if you need to buy it when it's a little bit higher than it is. It's still another opportunity. The market is just confirming you in that scenario. BI: Let's talk about your routine. How do you manage trading and going to school? You said you're a global macro trader. Talk to me about that. What do you trade? What markets do you trade and how are you finding time to do this?  JM: It can definitely seem difficult sometimes. Now in grade twelve I have a spare so I do have a little more time to look at the markets even when I'm at school. I have an iPad and I clear through Interactive Brokers so they have their own app on the iPad. So as long as I have an Internet connection, I can basically trade wherever I can. ¬†It's always a lot easier to absorb information when you're sitting in front of your desk. Once again, with Twitter, for example, I can check out what's happening because everyone is Tweeting about it. ¬†If something's happening in the markets and I have no clue what's happening because I'm just sitting in English class I can just quickly check Twitter and 'Oh, OK. That's what's happening.'¬† BI: What traders did you look up to as a kid growing up?¬† JM: The big guys that I up to were everyone in¬†Market Wizard¬†series. I really loved George Soros'¬†The Alchemy Of Finance, great book, where he goes through his trade thesis. I love Paul Tudor Jones for his risk management views. ¬†And Bruce Kovner for his way to bring together everything. Stanley Druckenmiller, I love the way he can bring together such a technical view and a fundamental view and piece it together and really bang out some good returns back then.¬† BI: You mentioned some great books. What are you three favorite trading books. The ones that have been the most influential to you?¬† JM: No. 1 would be¬†Market Wizards, No. 2.¬†Reminisces of a Stock Operator.¬†And No. 3. would be¬†The Daily Trading Coach¬†by Brett Steenbarger. His insights on the psychology of trading are just phenomenal.¬† BI: Alright, you're a high school student. What do you like to do for fun when you're not trading?¬† JM: I love hanging out with friends. I love playing tennis...Some video games. I guess I'll play occasionally. I'm not really an avid gamer. The market is my video game. Golf, I love to play in the summer.¬† BI: I read somewhere that you play the guitar.¬† JM: Yeah, I'm also self-taught on the guitar. I used to play piano. My mom put me into piano lessons at a pretty early age. I liked it, but it gave me a foundation. But I always liked classic rock music. I always wanted to play guitar. I just picked it up and went with it. It's a great stress reliever. I always have it right beside me on my trading desk. Whenever it's getting pretty active and I don't want to look at the screen I just pick it up and play away.¬† BI: Any favorite artists?¬† JM: I love classic rock so Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, lots of progressive rock. Also, I like a broad range. I like some electronic and some hip-hop as well. I guess my foundation would be in classic rock.¬† BI: What do you want to study in college?¬† JM: Finance and economics. Once again, it's my passion. As long as I'm looking at anything regarding markets, whether it's trading or research. I'm looking to do an economics and or finance degree.¬† BI: You said this is your passion. What do you want to do for you career? What's your ultimate goal?¬† JM: My ultimate goal is to be a hedge fund manager. Obviously, I need to do something with regards to the markets. That's my passion. Trading is the best way to be connected with the market...One of the key things with being a fund manager is it's a very lucrative business. There's definitely a lot of wealth to be made. With wealth, it gives you the power to help people and to impact the world. Since I've been looking at the markets and in the trading industry for so long now, I've realized how important transparency and financial literacy is. Hopefully, my ultimate goal is to make enough wealth and make an impact in that field. Just bringing financial literacy as a staple to the masses.¬† You can check out Marchese's website here.

AP: ADELE STARRIt has been nearly a month since the JOBS Act allowed hedge funds to advertise, but so far there have been few takers. According to reporting by the FT, smaller "upstarts" have shown interest in advertising, but the larger, more established funds view advertising as sign of failure to raise capital. Anthony Scaramucci, founder of Sky Bridge Capital, a fund of funds, tells the FT, ‚ÄúThe Goliaths in our industry are not going to advertise... They think it is gauche and d√©class√©, and their partners already have their private planes and their beachside mansions in the Hamptons, so why disrupt the business model?‚Äù¬† Investment News also reported that¬†advertising could draw regulatory attention to hedge funds, which are "notoriously private". A fund that wants to advertise would need to notify the SEC and disclose its solicitation materials, which would expose them to the SEC's scrutiny.¬† Another reason is that there is still uncertainty surrounding the advertising rule. While the SEC has allowed advertising, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has yet to authorize it, which could impact some firms trading certain derivatives transactions.¬† But for smaller hedge funds, advertising could provide just the exposure they need.¬†‚ÄúIt presents an opportunity for the Davids to come in with their slingshot, and we are working on our messaging right now. If you choose the right weaponry, you can take out Goliath,‚Äù Scaramucci told the FT.
Robert Shiller was one of three people to be awarded the 2013 Nobel prize in economics. The Nobel committee praised Shiller's work in forecasting asset prices. Among his many accomplishments, Shiller predicted that the U.S. housing market was in a bubble during a time when everyone thought prices had nowhere to go but up. And many are pointing to David Leonhardt's prescient August 2005 New York Times article titled "Be Warned: Mr. Bubble's Worried Again." In speeches, in television and radio interviews and in a second edition of his prophetic 2000 book, "Irrational Exuberance," he is arguing that the housing craze is another bubble destined to end badly, just as every other real-estate boom on record has. ...He predicts that prices could fall 40 percent in inflation-adjusted terms over the next generation and that the end of the bubble will probably cause a recession at some point. ..."This is the biggest boom we've ever had," said Mr. Shiller, who bought into the boom himself in 2002, with a vacation home near one of Connecticut's Thimble Islands. "So a very plausible scenario is that home-price increases continue for a couple more years, and then we might have a recession and they continue down into negative territory and languish for a decade. "It doesn't even attract that much attention," he continued. "There will be many people thinking it was a soft landing even though prices may have gone down in real terms by 40 percent." The then "largely unknown Yale economist" nailed it. Here's a chart of the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index showing that home prices peaked not long after this quote. S&P/Case-Shiller
Yale professor Robert Shiller, one of the three brilliant economists who¬†won the Nobel Prize for Economics¬†Monday morning, will teach you everything you need to know about financial markets for free. This is especially awesome since Shiller, along with¬†Eugene Fama and Lars Hansen of the University of Chicago,¬†won the Nobel for their work on ¬†the reality of accurate asset pricing on the near and long term. Lofty stuff, but here's how you can grab some of Shiller's extensive knowledge for free: Back in the spring of 2008 (yep, right as our economy was starting to crash), Shiller recorded 26 free podcasts¬†on topics ranging from options markets to portfolio diversification ‚Äî they're up on iTunes for you to enjoy. Here's the description of the podcast: (ECON 252) Financial institutions are a pillar of civilized society, supporting people in their productive ventures and managing the economic risks they take on. The workings of these institutions are important to comprehend if we are to predict their actions today and their evolution in the coming information age. The course strives to offer understanding of the theory of finance and its relation to the history, strengths and imperfections of such institutions as banking, insurance, securities, futures, and other derivatives markets, and the future of these institutions over the next century.

REUTERS/Arnd WiegmannNEW YORK/ZURICH (Reuters) - In spring 2009, senior Credit Suisse executive GaÎl de Boissard told colleagues at a strategy meeting that as the bank reshaped its bond trading business, they needed to remember the five stages of grief outlined decades ago by psychiatrist Elisabeth K¸bler-Ross. Denial would come first, followed by anger, bargaining, depression and finally acceptance, he said. "It is hard to be present in every business line in a world where capital is expensive. You have to make some choices," de Boissard, now co-head of the Credit Suisse investment bank, said in an interview. Credit Suisse has been among the most aggressive banks in paring back its fixed income, currency and commodities trading business after the financial crisis. The Swiss bank winnowed down the 120 product areas it traded in to around 80, through consolidating some businesses and exiting others altogether. With Credit Suisse's strategy now well set, it could be a template for other European and U.S. banks that are under increasing pressure from regulators to cut risk-taking, bank executives said. Banks are being squeezed on at least two fronts. Revenues are down by a third since 2009, but funding costs are higher because regulators are forcing banks to rely less on cheap debt to finance themselves, said Philippe Morel, a consultant at the Boston Consulting Group. The big banks cannot respond by buying one another - the way companies in the steel, auto and pharmaceutical industries have done to reduce excess capacity - because regulators do not want banks to get any bigger, Morel said. The only real option left for most major banks globally is to voluntarily shrink to be sufficiently profitable, he added. Credit Suisse did not have a choice. The Swiss government, which was shocked by the near-collapse of UBS AG in 2008, moved earlier and more forcefully than other regulators to require banks to rely less on debt funding and more on equity, which can cushion them better against losses. Even though Credit Suisse navigated the financial crisis relatively well and received no taxpayer bailouts, executives felt they had to face up to new rules and weaker revenue, and start cutting. They focused on slashing areas where their market position was weak and the capital requirements were high, such as commodities trading. If they did not make changes, Credit Suisse executives determined that the investment bank's return on equity, a measure of the returns they wring from shareholders' money, would have fallen to 10 percent from 19 percent, an unacceptably low level. With the changes, they aim to get returns closer to 17 percent. So far, the efforts have paid off - Credit Suisse's investment bank posted a return on capital of 18 percent in the first half of the year, as revenue increased 9 percent, helped by businesses including fixed-income trading. "Credit Suisse moved very quickly, to their credit," said analyst Chris Wheeler of Mediobanca. "They're getting much bigger bang for their buck," he said. There are risks to Credit Suisse's strategy. Businesses that the bank exits may come roaring back, and businesses that it stays in may produce less profit than expected. What's more, rivals with weak hands may be slow to fold, reducing profitability for everyone else, analysts said. CUTTING SURGICALLY UBS AG last year gutted much of its fixed income business and announced it was eliminating some 10,000 jobs. The move included closing its distressed-debt trading desk, which would require a lot more capital under new rules. UBS is encouraged by the results so far, a company spokeswoman said. So far, stock investors seem to be as well. Since the day before Credit Suisse announced the acceleration of its contraction plans in 2011, UBS shares have gained 65 percent, more than four times the 14 percent rise in Credit Suisse shares. But rivals say they are more likely to follow Credit Suisse's strategy, which has been more surgical. In 2009, the bank set its initial course and disposed of businesses that most obviously would do badly in the new environment, such as trading with the bank's own money, and European commercial mortgage securities. In November 2011, the bank cut deeper. It slashed capital for interest-rate and foreign exchange trading by 60 percent. It rushed out of low-revenue trades that ate up a good deal of capital because they were not backed by collateral and matured in 10 to 15 years, or more. It looked closely at potential profits in businesses where it was long a laggard. In commodities trading, it ranked in the bottom tier among global banks. Consulting firm McKinsey said then that across Wall Street, the return on equity in commodities was poised to fall from around 20 percent pre-crisis to around 8 percent after new regulations are fully implemented. Some decisions were particularly hard. De Boissard remembers the grief inside the bank, when his team could not offer a derivative to an Australian company that was looking to borrow in Swiss francs but pay its debt in Aussie dollars. "You'd miss a big trade with a client and you'd naturally get people questioning whether we were doing the right thing," he said. Some people in the bank were reluctant to adapt, de Boissard said. "I remember saying to people if you are not good at change, this would be a good time to get off of the platform." But from the end of September 2011 through the end of September 2012, the company slashed risk-weighted assets, a key indicator of capital needs, by 43 percent in the fixed-income section of the investment bank. The moves, which included distributing some risky assets to employees as part of their compensation (a tactic Credit Suisse had used early in the crisis) almost immediately lifted returns. In the first half of 2012, the investment banking segment of the company reported a return on regulatory capital, known as Basel 3 capital, of 12 percent compared with 8 percent a year earlier. Those returns have edged higher since then, as the company continued shifting assets, although gains at this point are more incremental. FOLLOWERS Rivals have already shown signs of following Credit Suisse's strategy. Deutsche Bank AG is in the process of deciding which businesses to continue after concluding that it must purge as much as 250 billion euros of assets, or 16 percent of total assets after adjusting for items like derivatives, to meet new bank safety rules. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co is tuning up its business, albeit less radically. It decided in July to sell its physical commodities business after concluding profits were too slight to justify the demands the company would face from regulators to keep it. In September, JPMorgan said it will quit making loans to students. Morgan Stanley has stepped back from many areas where it was once a big player, including trading secured bonds known as asset-backed securities, in favor of standardized products that trade on exchanges and require the bank to hold much less capital. Many banks are unsure how many businesses may come roaring back as the economic cycle improves, and how many are permanently impaired. Industry analyst Brad Hintz of Bernstein Research sees banks fighting "a war of attrition over the next three to five years," in their fixed-income trading businesses, he wrote in a report in September. Another risk is that too many banks will all concentrate on the same businesses, squeezing out profits. For example, competition is increasing in processing businesses, which require little capital because they entail moving money around the world for companies, governments and investors. Outside of fixed-income trading, wealth management could feel its profits squeezed. Credit Suisse plans to commit the same amount of capital to private banking and wealth management as it does to investment banking. Right now, it applies less than two-thirds as much capital to its private wealth business. The bank's chief financial officer, David Mathers, brushed aside those concerns on a conference call with investors last month. When asked if profit in private wealth management would fall, he said that customers care more about good service than rock-bottom costs, so the business would continue to be attractive.

NEW YORK/TOKYO (Reuters) - Boeing Co's &lt;BA.N&gt; loss of a major Japanese airplane order to rival Airbus &lt;EAD.PA&gt; this week may produce a surprise U.S. benefit - bringing aerospace work home to U.S. companies. Over the past 50 years, Boeing has increasingly outsourced large airplane pieces such as wings and fuselage sections. Its partnerships with Japanese companies carried the understanding that Japanese airlines would keep buying Boeing planes. The virtuous circle gave work to Japan's heavy industrial companies and helped Boeing keep Airbus largely out of the Japanese market. But on Monday, Japan Airlines Co Ltd &lt;9201.T&gt; appeared to shatter the alliance by ordering 31 Airbus A350s to replace 31 Boeing 777s that it will retire this decade. The $9.5 billion JAL deal is considered by some industry experts as likely to prompt Boeing to award less supply work to Japan in the future. Boeing would send that work to other countries, including the United States. Japanese airlines were big buyers of Boeing's 787 Dreamliner, which helped justify the large investments Japanese companies made to set up production of major components, said Ron Epstein, an analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The 777X, the next generation of Boeing's popular widebody jet, is supposed to have its design and building launch this year and enter service by 2020. The 787 Dreamliner is the company's latest state-of-the-art widebody aircraft. It has been in service for two years but has encountered numerous technical problems. Since Japan airlines are so far not big buyers of the 777X, "why would industrial policy follow the same plan?" Epstein said. Many people assumed Japan's "heavies" would be involved in the 777X, he added. "Maybe they're not going to be as big players on this." Boeing said it is considering all options on where to build the 777X, but declined to discuss whether the JAL decision would affect its thinking. "We have built a strong relationship with Japan Airlines over the last 50 years and we look to continue our partnership going forward," the company said in a statement on Monday. Officials at Mitsubishi Heavy Industries &lt;7011.T&gt;, Kawasaki Heavy Industries &lt;7012.T&gt; and Fuji Heavy Industries &lt;7270.T&gt; also declined to comment on their potential work on the 777X until after the new plane is formally launched. The launch is widely expected at the Dubai airshow in November, where industry sources say Emirates Airline &lt;EMIRA.UL&gt; plans to order 150 widebody planes, most likely the 777X. However, at Mitsubishi, which is responsible for the 787 wing and would be most affected if Boeing brought wing assembly to the United States, a spokesman suggested the contract is up for grabs. "It's a decision that Boeing will make," he said. "If we are asked to build the wing we will do our best, if not we will still work our hardest." LIMITED OPTIONS Boeing has limited options for where it could build the 777X plane and its components since only a handful of companies have the scale and certification to take on such a project reliably. Among those considered as possible: Spirit Aerosystems in Wichita, Kansas, a former Boeing facility that already makes wing parts and fuselages for Boeing; Triumph Group, headquartered in Berwyn, Pennsylvania, which makes wing, fuselage and structural pieces for planes, as well as composite structures, though not those used for airframes, according to the company website. Boeing also could bring the work in-house, either at its massive factory in Everett, Washington, or at the assembly plant in Charleston, South Carolina, where it builds some 787s. Boeing is buying land to expand that factory. Spirit said it is interested, and noted it is a significant supplier to the 777, making wing, fuselage and underwing components. Triumph did not respond to requests for comment. Korea and China also have been mentioned as possible sites for production of at least part of the 777X. A person close to Boeing with knowledge of the matter said a global cost-cutting initiative by the company would likely force suppliers in Japan to look for low-cost manufacturers in China and India, pointing to a rise in the Chinese portion of supply chain and a reduction for Japan. Boeing's "Partnering for Success" cost-cutting program, launched in 2012, requires 15 percent cuts over three to four years from all suppliers including the Japanese "heavies," this person said. TAX INCENTIVES Meanwhile, Boeing's former home state of Washington is making a big push to win the 777X, after 787 work went to Japan and elsewhere. Washington State Governor Jay Inslee, whose state touts itself as home of the world's largest cluster of aerospace companies, last week proposed extending lucrative state tax breaks for Boeing until 2040 if the company builds the 777X and its wings in Washington. Boeing already builds the 777 in Washington, so the logic of putting future production there is strong, state officials say. In addition, the extended breaks would apply to all Boeing production in Washington, giving the state an edge against competitors such as South Carolina and Kansas, where Boeing's production is much more limited, said Alex Pietsch, director of the Washington state governor's office of aerospace. Part of the state's pitch: The 777X's composite wing will be large and difficult to transport, so it makes sense to fabricate it near the site of final assembly, Pietsch said. State studies show that current 777 production supplies $20 billion of some $76 billion in annual economic activity from the state aerospace industry. A state task force is working on a proposal that could be put forth as early as November, if a special legislative session is called in Washington, he said. If so, that may just coincide with Boeing's long-awaited launch of the 777X in Dubai. "I'd love to have them come out in Dubai and say they're going to build the 777X in Washington," Pietsch said.

APLarry Summers has been relatively silent since removing himself from the running for Fed Chair. But now, the former Treasury secretary is out with an op-ed decrying the budget battle in Washington. Some lawmakers are too focused on the debt when they should be focused on spurring growth, Summers writes. "Projections that there is a major deficit problem are highly uncertain," Summers wrote on his blog and in the FT. "And policies that indirectly address deficit issues by focusing on growth are sounder economically and more plausible politically than the long-term budget deals with which much of the policy community is obsessed." From the op-ed: Beyond the fact that spurring growth has a multiplicity of benefits, of which reduced¬†federal debt is only one, there is the further aspect that growth-enhancing policies have more widely felt benefits than measures that raise taxes or cut spending. Spurring growth is also an area where neither side of the political spectrum has a monopoly on good ideas. We need more public infrastructure investment but we also need to reduce regulatory barriers that hold back private infrastructure. We need more investment in education but also increases in accountability for those who provide it. We need more investment in the basic science behind renewable energy technologies, but in the medium term we need to take advantage of the remarkable natural gas resources that have recently become available to the US. We need to assure that government has the tools to work effectively in the information age but also to assure that public policy promotes entrepreneurship. "If even half the energy that has been devoted over the past five years to ‚Äúbudget deals‚Äù were devoted instead to 'growth strategies' we could enjoy sounder government finances and a restoration of the power of the American example," Summers concludes.

Wikimedia CommonsRobert ShillerYale University professor Robert Shiller was one of three people to win the 2013 Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences (also known as the Nobel Prize in Economics). Shiller is already a god among economists. He famously predicted two of the biggest bubbles of all time: the dot-com bubble and the housing bubble.¬† Both times, he published an edition of his book Irrational Exuberance, which described and predicted each respective bubble. The theme of this year's award "Trendspotting in asset markets," and the Nobel committee pointed to Shiller's work in forecasting intermediate-term moves in asset prices. "He found that stock prices fluctuate much more than corporate dividends, and that the ratio of prices to dividends tends to fall when it is high, and to increase when it is low," said the Nobel Committee. "This pattern holds not only for stocks, but also for bonds and other assets." Shiller regularly updates his data and makes it available for free online. He is responsible for two charts, that everyone in finance follow very closely. The first chart is of the cyclically-adjusted price-earnings (CAPE) ratio.¬† CAPE is calculated by taking the S&amp;P 500 and dividing it by the average of ten years worth of earnings.¬† If the ratio is above the long-term average of around 16, the stock market is considered expensive. Shiller has argued that the CAPE is remarkably good at predicting returns over the period of several years. As you can see, the CAPE ratio reached insanely high levels during the dotcom bubble. Yale The second chart is of a long-term look at home prices adjusted for inflation. During the early 2000s, home prices took off, forcing Shiller to publish the second edition of Irrational Exuberance. As you can see, homes are not great assets if you're looking for real returns. "Housing traditionally is not viewed as a great investment," he told Bloomberg's Trish Regan earlier this year. "It takes maintenance, it depreciates, it goes out of style. All of those are problems. And there's technical progress in housing. So, new ones are better. "So, why was it considered an investment? That was a fad. That was an idea that took hold in the early 2000's. And I don't expect it to come back. Not with the same force. So people might just decide, "Yeah, I'll diversify my portfolio. I'll live in a rental." That is a very sensible thing for many people to do." Yale No one will argue that Shiller wasn't deserving of the Nobel prize. If anything, it was long overdue.
BofA Merrill Lynch Global ResearchResults of the BofA Merrill Lynch rates and FX strategy team's October fund manager survey.The BofA Merrill Lynch rates and FX strategy team has just published the results of its October fund-manager survey, which contains an interesting observation: Investors still view the December FOMC meeting as the most likely timeframe in which the Federal Reserve will begin scaling back its quantitative easing program. Thirty-seven percent of the 80 global fixed income managers surveyed by BAML between Oct. 4 and Oct. 9 said they expect the Fed to begin tapering in December, while 31% think January is more likely, and 25% think the FOMC will delay until March. This is in spite of the ongoing government shutdown and the attendant blackout of economic data reports compiled and released by government agencies, which members of the FOMC have cited in recent weeks as a barrier to discerning whether the economy is yet able to handle a reduction in monetary stimulus. Many Wall Street economists ‚Äî including those at BAML ‚Äî have written off the possibility of tapering until 2014, given the adverse effects the government shutdown is thought to have on the economy. Last week, BAML economist Ethan Harris downgraded the bank's official forecasts for U.S. GDP growth in Q3 and Q4, citing¬†decreased government spending and attendant "significant spillovers into the private sector" resulting from the shutdown. BofA Merrill Lynch Global ResearchResults of the BofA Merrill Lynch rates and FX strategy team's October fund manager survey. "While a December taper is still possible, more likely the Fed will wait until January to start tapering and we see¬†virtually no chance of tapering at their October 29-30 meeting," said Harris. The BAML survey also asked fund managers what they thought was the most crowded trade. Long U.S. equities was the winner. Short Treasuries was not far behind.
AP The stock market is open today, but the bond market is closed for Columbus Day. We've seen some people talk about how this is unfortunate, since the bond market would give us a good read on how markets view the situation in Washington. The premise is that since a debt-ceiling breach involves, well, U.S. debt, than that's where you need to watch for stress. Don't buy it though. The stock market is great in that it tends to send a crystal clear message. When things are bad, stocks go down. When things are good, stocks go up. When things are really bad, stocks crash. Bonds can be more subtle, especially in a situation like this. Bad news could easily result in LOWER U.S. borrowing costs, especially at the long end, as investors pile into debt for "safety." And it's not that ironic that investors would buy debt for safety in a debt-ceiling situation. A default on a short-term T-Bill doesn't result in a default on Treasuries (at least right away), and a debt ceiling standoff could imply lower growth and lower inflation. So basically, the bond market can be unclear in its message. Stocks rarely have this kind of ambiguity. Bad news.

And that means the public U.S. data agencies will be canceling or delaying their economic reports. "Some reports that would normally be published this week haven‚Äôt yet been compiled suggesting delays even following a shutdown resolution," said Citi's Peter D'Antonio. "Going forward, some surveys may not take place, potentially creating permanent gaps in the data records for this period." Meanwhile, the very scary debt ceiling is only days away. Here's your Monday Scouting Report: Top Story Economic Calendar (*These releases will be delayed if the U.S. government is shut down.) Market Commentary "The likelihood of a deal to lift the debt ceiling and end the shutdown before October 18th has increased, but only for a deal of limited scope and duration," said Deutsche Bank's David Bianco. "Such a deal is not the deal investors wished for and it will put the burden on 3Q earnings and macro data to push the S&amp;P to 1750 or higher by yearend." We have a "high stakes week ahead," he said.
REUTERS/Jim YoungUniversity of Chicago professor Eugene F. FamaProfessor Eugene Fama of the University of Chicago was one of the three economists to be awarded the 2013 Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences. The theme of this year's award "Trendspotting in asset markets," and the Nobel committee pointed to Fama's ground-breaking work advancing the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH). "Beginning in the 1960s, Eugene Fama and several collaborators demonstrated that stock prices are extremely difficult to predict in the short run, and that new information is very quickly incorporated into prices," they explained. "These findings not only had a profound impact on subsequent research but also changed market practice. The emergence of so-called index funds in stock markets all over the world is a prominent example." The EMH more or less argues that the all available information is already priced into the market. And therefore, it is basically impossible to beat the market. Here's an excerpt from Wikipedia: Fama is most often thought of as the father of efficient market hypothesis, beginning with his Ph.D. thesis. In a ground-breaking article in the May, 1970 issue of the Journal of Finance, entitled "Efficient Capital Markets: A Review of Theory and Empirical Work," Fama proposed two crucial concepts that have defined the conversation on efficient markets ever since. First, Fama proposed three types of efficiency: (i) strong-form; (ii) semi-strong form; and (iii) weak efficiency. They are explained in the context of what information are factored in price. In weak form efficiency the information set is just historical prices, which can be predicted from historical price trend; thus, it is impossible to profit from it. Semi-strong form requires that all public information is reflected in prices already, such as companies' announcements or annual earnings figures. Finally, the strong-form concerns all information, including private information are incorporated in price; it states no monopolistic information can entail profits, in other words, insider trading cannot make a profit in the strong-form market efficiency world. Second, Fama demonstrated that the notion of market efficiency could not be rejected without an accompanying rejection of the model of market equilibrium (e.g. the price setting mechanism). This concept, known as the "joint hypothesis problem," has ever since vexed researchers. Market efficiency denotes how information is factored in price, Fama (1970) emphasizes that the hypothesis of market efficiency must be tested in the context of expected returns. The joint hypothesis problem states that when a model yields a return significantly different from the actual return, one can never be certain if there exists an imperfection in the model or if the market is inefficient. Researchers can only modify their models by adding different factors to eliminate any anomalies, in hopes of fully explaining the return within the model. The anomaly, also known as alpha in the modeling test, thus functions as a signal to the model maker whether it can perfectly predict returns by the factors in the model. However, as long as there exists an alpha, neither the conclusion of a flawed model nor market inefficiency can be drawn according to the Joint Hypothesis. Fama (1991) also stresses that market efficiency per se is not testable and can only be tested jointly with some model of equilibrium, i.e. an asset-pricing model. However, not everyone agrees with the stronger forms of the EMH. In particular, the hedge fund industry has long argued that it is possible to find small opportunities or have an informational edge, among other things, which help generated extraordinary returns. Regardless, everyone seems to agree that mom-and-pop have almost no hope in making money by trading in the short-term. And we can all thank Fama for advancing that. Here's the slide that the Nobel committee showed while presenting Fama with the award. Nobel
Facing mounting legal charges, SAC Capital's billionaire manager Steve Cohen will auction a handful of famous pieces of art from his storied collection, the New York Times' Peter Lattman and Carol Vogel report. Cohen ó who has seen redemptions from his fund as his lawyers reportedly broker a $2 billion deal with the SEC over a years-long insider trading investigation ó will put up two major Andy Warhol paintings and an "abstract canvas" by Gerhard Richter, sources told the Times. From the report: The two Warhols, both painted in 1963, are ìLiz #1 (early Colored Liz),î an image of Elizabeth Taylor on a bright yellow background estimated to sell for $20 million to $30 million, and ì5 Deaths on Turquoise (Turquoise Disaster),î thought to bring in $7 million to $10 million. Sothebyís featured the Warhols last week at the Katara Art Center in Doha, Qatar, where it was showing upcoming highlights from next monthís event. People familiar with Mr. Cohenís collection said that these paintings were part of a larger group of his works being put up for auction. In April, Cohen purchased Picasso's "Le†RÍve" for $150 million†from casino magnate Stephen Wynn. "When you stand in front of it, youíre blown away," Cohen told the Times†then in a rare interview. Cohen's fund ó which stood at $15 billion at the beginning of the year ó could become just a family office once investor money is returned, a process already underway. About $9 billion of assets under management is Cohen's fortune. Read the full report at the New York Times†ª

APWith just a few days to go until the Oct. 17 deadline, here are two risks to think about for The White House. The first is the perception that if there's no deal reached, it will be because of Democratic "overreach" that they could have had an agreement this weekend, but that Harry Reid and fellow Senate Democrats killed that agreement, because they wanted more on spending. That might not technically true ‚Äî Democrats just want to renegotiate the sequester-level spending sooner than Republicans do ‚Äî but still, the view could emerge of Democrats getting greedy and letting the whole thing go bust. And the second risk is that if we get to October 17, the world won't actually end right away. The Treasury might be out of maneuvers, but the Treasury won't literally run out of cash for several more days. Then everyone starts talking about how this was all a phony deadline and deal urgency collapses, and people blame The White House and Treasury for yelling about how the sky is falling. How the politics would play in a post October 17 world is quite unclear.

Screenshot via Bloomberg TVProf. Robert Shiller, one of three winners of this year's Nobel Prize in Economics.Professors Eugene Fama of the University of Chicago, Lars Hansen of the University of Chicago and Robert Shiller of Yale have won the Nobel Prize in Economics for their work on asset pricing. Here's the full press release from the Nobel committee: There is no way to predict the price of stocks and bonds over the next few days or weeks. But it is quite possible to foresee the broad course of these prices over longer periods, such as the next three to five years. These findings, which might seem both surprising and contradictory, were made and analyzed by this year‚Äôs Laureates, Eugene Fama, Lars Peter Hansen and Robert Shiller. Beginning in the 1960s, Eugene Fama and several collaborators demonstrated that stock prices are extremely difficult to predict in the short run, and that new information is very quickly incorporated into prices. These findings not only had a profound impact on subsequent research but also changed market practice. The emergence of so-called index funds in stock markets all over the world is a prominent example. If prices are nearly impossible to predict over days or weeks, then shouldn‚Äôt they be even harder to predict over several years? The answer is no, as Robert Shiller discovered in the early 1980s. He found that stock prices fluctuate much more than corporate dividends, and that the ratio of prices to dividends tends to fall when it is high, and to increase when it is low. This pattern holds not only for stocks, but also for bonds and other assets. One approach interprets these findings in terms of the response by rational investors to uncertainty in prices. High future returns are then viewed as compensation for holding risky assets during unusually risky times. Lars Peter Hansen developed a statistical method that is particularly well suited to testing rational theories of asset pricing. Using this method, Hansen and other researchers have found that modifications of these theories go a long way toward explaining asset prices. Another approach focuses on departures from rational investor behavior. So-called behavioral finance takes into account institutional restrictions, such as borrowing limits, which prevent smart investors from trading against any mispricing in the market. The Laureates have laid the foundation for the current understanding of asset prices. It relies in part on fluctuations in risk and risk attitudes, and in part on behavioral biases and market frictions.
gracey / FlickrA whipsaw is a "long, narrowing, tapering ripsaw, usually set in a frame and worked by one or two persons." Webster's Unabridged Dictionary, second edition.¬†¬† What a play on words.¬†¬† "Long," as in, we are now passing two weeks of shutdown. Different scenarios take this Washington theatre out to Thanksgiving, Christmas, or into January. A few weeks' delay may not resolve anything.¬†¬† "Narrowing," as in the cash balance at the US Treasury. Will the Treasury run out of cash on October 17? We think not. Will the crunch hit in November, starting with the Social Security payments on November 1? And be exacerbated by the November debt payments? We think that might be a more likely pressure point. Will the Republicans point to the Treasury on October 18 and say, "See, the world did not end yesterday; you misled us"? Get ready for that political round.¬† ¬† "Tapering," as in the on-again, off-again Fed policy of reducing the amount of new purchases of securities. Current Fed policy is to buy $85 billion a month. What does the Fed do when the debt-limit debate stops the creation of new securities? Is any potential policy change being injected into the debate? The actual federal deficit is now under $700 billion and falling. The amount of newly created, federally backed mortgage paper is limited. The Fed is already buying more than 100% of what is newly created. And we may see no debt limit increase by Congress and therefore a forced balanced budget. That would mean no additional net new Treasury debt.¬†¬† The political scene is a whipsaw of news flows and surprises. As a money manager, we know that this is a dangerous way to make investment decisions. We have seen two major whipsaws. Let's talk about each of them.¬†¬† The first resulted from the rhetorical buildup implying that tapering was coming. This started in mid-May, 2013, and we saw a continuous flow of Federal Reserve officials offering discussions of tapering and accompanying policy. Then came the September FOMC meeting, where the Fed announced there would be no tapering, even though the markets had been primed to expect ‚Äì and had priced in ‚Äì the onset of mild tapering. That development triggered a stock market explosion followed by a reality check and sell-off.¬†¬† So whipsaw number one we can blame on the Fed. They created an expectation; they seemed to affirm and reaffirm it; and then they surprised to the contrary. Now they face an October meeting, and markets do not know what to expect. It seems markets are discounting an extension of present Fed policy for several more months, until there is clarity on the budget and debt-limit fights. But if Fed policy is now without much efficacy, does delaying tapering actually help matters? Markets are involved in this debate. So are Fed members.¬†¬† The second whipsaw is underway. It was not long after the tapering whipsaw had reverberated through the markets that the continuing-resolution, budget, debt-limit fight flared up on schedule and escalated to the present impasse. All hope of compromise was smashed, and a resolution has yet to materialize. The intensity of the fight led to the market‚Äôs perception of a possible risk of US default. We never thought the odds of default were very high, but the intensity of the rhetoric was sufficient to raise them above zero. Markets reacted. US credit default swap pricing spiked. In response, very short-term Treasury obligations became elevated in yield, and the very short end of the Treasury yield curve actually inverted. Announcements came: some large institutions were divesting themselves of short-term Treasurys. The self-perpetuating momentum of fear and panic drove the VIX above 20. A rising VIX and a rising CDS on the United States have always coincided with stock market weakness.¬†¬† Now we have another news flow shift as the whipsaw heads back in the opposite direction. Just because politicians are talking with each other, for two days stock markets have again exploded. I guess the market is celebrating its relief that politicians are talking at each other rather than past each other. How much of the rally was short covering and how much was based on belief that policy will change is impossible to determine. So if the basis for the rally was the expectation that there is a durable political deal actually in the offing, the market‚Äôs celebratory response seems premature to us. Hence we can expect more whipsaw.¬†¬† Stock prices are based upon many things. The dominant strategic factors are earnings and the prospect for growth of earnings. Earnings come out of profits. The GDP profit share in the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) is consistently measured and exhibited in data. These days we cannot obtain current data because of the government shutdown, but we do have ways to estimate what the data would reveal. Without corroborating official statistics the estimates are guesstimates, but the profit share that we can estimate is currently at a very high level. Can it go higher? Yes. Will it? That is much harder to discern.¬†¬† Meanwhile the US economy is operating at a tepid growth rate. Estimates of that growth rate are falling as uncertainty wrought by irresponsible political brinksmanship only acts to slow growth to a lower level than it would otherwise be. All this whipsaw uncertainty created by the government (Congress and the White House) and by the Fed does not help growth accelerate; it causes it to decelerate.¬†¬† Slow economic growth means low earnings growth. The profit share is at a peak level, so risk is rising. Therefore, plunging back into the stock market without dissecting the sectors and being able to clearly see earnings prospects is a dangerous game. Investment actions driven by political whipsaws are not valid, data-driven decisions; they are gambler's‚Äô actions.¬†¬† We have not chased the rally; we are still maintaining cash reserves. Of course, we would like to see the US government operate in accordance with the principles of good governance. Of course, we would like to see the political leaders of our country reach longer-term, sustainable, and dependable agreements on the budget and debt, and proceed to implement them.¬†¬† But the truth is, we distrust politicians, and what we are watching is failed governance. This is true for the White House, the Senate, and the House of Representatives, and for Democrats as well as Republicans.¬†¬† We have to watch their actions and not their words. And we need to hold some cash reserves.¬†¬† Whipsawing will be with us for a while. Stock market entry points for a fully invested position are best found either when cheap pricing and high negative sentiment combine or when there is clarity of policy. Right now, neither of these exists.
REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst A corridor is marked closed to foot traffic at the U.S. Capitol, as the current budget fracas and potential government shutdown unfolds, in Washington, September 30, 2013.From time to time, an editorial shows up in a Chinese news outlet that people pay attention to because they think that it somehow represents some elite view held by members of government. Over the weekend, a story popped up on Xinhua calling on the world to become "De-Americanized" and lots of people are passing it around, given the embarrassing situation of what's happening in Washington. The article goes beyond mere slamming DC over fiscal failures, but takes on the entire premise of US global influence: As U.S. politicians of both political parties are still shuffling back and forth between the White House and the Capitol Hill without striking a viable deal to bring normality to the body politic they brag about, it is perhaps a good time for the befuddled world to start considering building a de-Americanized world. Emerging from the bloodshed of the Second World War as the world's most powerful nation, the United States has since then been trying to build a global empire by imposing a postwar world order, fueling recovery in Europe, and encouraging regime-change in nations that it deems hardly Washington-friendly. With its seemingly unrivaled economic and military might, the United States has declared that it has vital national interests to protect in nearly every corner of the globe, and been habituated to meddling in the business of other countries and regions far away from its shores. Meanwhile, the U.S. government has gone to all lengths to appear before the world as the one that claims the moral high ground, yet covertly doing things that are as audacious as torturing prisoners of war, slaying civilians in drone attacks, and spying on world leaders. It goes on like that. Does the editorial have any significance to anything? We have no idea, except that there are probably elites in China looking at the US and wondering why the hell we're clowning around. And that at the margins doesn't help the world. But whether it really hurts anything or matters in a substantive way is up for debate.
Ben Franske, Wikimedia commons We're just a few days away now from October 17, the date that the Treasury has given as the point at which it will have exhausted its special measures to maintain borrowing under the legal debt ceiling. If we go past that date without a deal to raise the debt ceiling, we'll be in uncharted territory, and people can only try to guess what series of measures will be taken by the government, and what the economic ramifications would be. Zachary Goldfarb and Jim Tankersley at The Washington Post have a nice look at what a post-debt ceiling economy would look like, and the scary thing is that it could be very bad even if you assume there's some way to go on without an out-and-out default on the nation's debt. According to the Bipartisan Policy Center, which has done the most detailed analysis of federal finances in a debt-ceiling breach, administration officials would have to consider delaying or suspending tens of billions of dollars in critical payments to low-income people and seniors. Under the most alarming scenario, as soon as Friday, payments to Medicare and Medicaid providers, unemployment benefits, Social Security checks and tax refunds would be postponed for one to four days. Food stamps due to be distributed Oct.†25 could be held until Oct.†30. The same would happen to payments to defense contractors. With huge payments due in early November, the situation would become grimmer. Nearly $60†billion in Social Security checks, veterans benefits and pay for active-duty troops is due Nov.†1. Those could be delayed nearly two weeks, according to the Bipartisan Policy Centerís analysis. Needless to say, just this new dose of austerity could wallop the economy at a time when consumer confidence is already in a state of freefall. Gallup's economic confidence index cratered further over the weekend to one of the lowest levels since the Great Financial Crisis. Gallup It's easy to imagine this turning into a new recession if it goes on for any length of time. Remember, Goldman has said that in a debt ceiling breach, you can say goodbye to over 4% of GDP. There's an assumption that a swift market reaction would force a deal very shortly, but you can't be too sure how things play out, and a spiraling crisis could cause parties to dig in even further, and blame the other side instead. We should know very soon what the impact of all this would be, as earnings season is starting up in earnest, and corporate managers will have reads on what Q4 economic/consumer activity is looking like.
ShutterstockCurrent consensus GDP estimates for Q4 sit at about 2.5%. ¬†That‚Äôs not bad considering the fact that the economy is still crawling out of the credit crisis hole. ¬†But as the shutdown drags on we‚Äôre beginning to see more and more meaningful signs that this is dragging down economic growth. ¬†According to Goldman the shutdown should hurt Q4 GDP by about 0.5% which brings their estimate down to 2%. ¬†This isn‚Äôt a huge deal yet and I presume the Goldman estimate doesn‚Äôt account for potential back pay which most furloughed employees should get, but as this drags on longer and longer it will start to have a real meaningful impact on confidence and growth. I am sort of at a lost for words at this point. ¬†If I don‚Äôt meet important deadlines then I get fired by my clients. ¬†I am sure your work is the same. ¬†Instead, when Congress can‚Äôt do their job they continue to get paid and the rest of us have to undergo the self inflicted pain. ¬†Here are the details on the Goldman view (via ZH): ‚ÄúFrom October 1-4, we believe the shutdown probably reduced federal compensation by roughly $400mn per day. We would expect the non-compensation aspects of the initial stage of the shutdown to have been very modest. Overall, the first four business days of the shutdown probably reduced growth by 0.16pp. The shutdown has now lasted a second week, but the incremental effect should be smaller. The Department of Defense has brought most of its employees back to work, leaving 450k federal employees still out of work, and thus reducing the effect on federal compensation to $225mn per day. We would expect a small reduction in services-related consumption as well. After the second week of shutdown, we believe the cumulative reduction in Q4 real GDP growth amounts to 0.28pp (Exhibit 2). ‚Ä¶ If a longer-term resolution can be reached over the coming days, we would expect the downside risk from the fiscal debate to be limited to about 0.5pp in Q4, compared to our current growth forecast of 2.5%.‚Äù
Speaker.govOn Saturday morning, House Speaker John Boehner told his Republican colleagues that talks between him and the president had broken down, and that the situation had moved to the Senate to see if they could work something out. At the time he said that, it looked like momentum was building around a plan put forth by Maine Senator Susan Collins to both reopen the government and raise the debt ceiling. The idea was to pass that in the Senate, and then "jam" the House, forcing House Republicans to take up the bill as a last-second vehicle to avoid a debt-ceiling disaster. But the Democrats swatted down the Collins bill, and then Senate leadership proceeded to spend the rest of the weekend making no outward progress. And so the House may come back into the picture. POLITICO reports that the House GOP is considering its own last-minute six-week debt ceiling hike, although though the bill would be anything but the "clean" bill the President has asked for. Attaching the so-called Vitter amendment to the debt-limit increase is one option, according to House GOP sources. That provision would end health-insurance subsidies for members of Congress, their aides and other federal government employees. Another option is delaying or repealing the medical device tax. Reid and Senate Democrats have opposed both proposals so far, but with the debt limit clock ticking, House Republicans may have more leverage now. Also according to Robert Costa, the bill could have some kind of income verification for Obamacare enrollees as well as a bill pushed by Congressman Lankford that would automatically cut spending in the event of a government shutdown, which seems like a clear poison pill. If the Senate can't act soon, the House might pass this, and then you'll have a situation in which the only bill to raise the debt ceiling is something the Senate would never sign, with the House feeling as though it has done its work.
Flickr/Rob and Stephanie LevyUS futures are heading lower this morning, as the debt ceiling deadline races closer without there being a deal. Talks seemingly went nowhere over the weekend, as negotiations in the Senate stalled out, while according to John Boehner, talks between Obama and the House collapsed. Negotiations remained ongoing in the Senate, between the leadership of both parties, but time is now incredibly short if the two sides want to cobble together a deal that can be passed by both houses of Congress. Futures are set to open off about 0.7%. But other than that, markets are calm. Stocks in Asia didn't do much. Stocks in Europe are mixed. The bond market is closed today in the US, which might dull a little bit the signal that markets might be telling Washington. But it shouldn't be a problem. The stock market can do all the heavy lifting of voicing the displeasure if there not being a deal.
