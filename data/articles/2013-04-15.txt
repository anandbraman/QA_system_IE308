Wikimedia Commons"The Adoration of the Golden Calf"We have just witnessed the most horrific gold sell-off in 30 years. And the gold bugs can say almost whatever they want about it.¬† They can call it a correction or a conspiracy.¬† They can blame it on deflation, or even Goldman Sachs. But one thing they cannot say: gold is a safe haven. "It's interesting, however, that gold prices are falling like a rock ‚Äî or like a gold brick ‚Äî at a time of heightened global uncertainty," said economist and gold agnostic Gary Shilling in an email to Business Insider on Monday.¬† "Where is the safe haven appeal of gold?¬† Is gold simply one more commodity falling with the herd?" In just about three trading sessions, gold has plunged by over $200/oz. "We've traded gold for nearly four decades and we've never‚Ä¶ ever‚Ä¶ ever‚Ä¶ seen anything like what we've witnessed in the past two trading sessions," said Dennis Gartman in a note on Monday. Gartman warned his readers about gold's safe haven status a year ago in the wake of a much more tame move: "Safe havens are safe. Safe havens are stable; gold is not safe and certainly it is not stable." The bottom line is that gold is not a safe haven.¬† In other words, it is not a stable place to store your wealth.¬† The horrific sell-off of the last few days is clear evidence of this. "Any thoughts about persistent safe havens (other than perhaps cash under your mattress) are dangerous," warned Goldman Sachs' Jim O'Neill.

During a press conference intended to provide updates regarding the investigation into the bombing of the Boston Marathon, one individual present asked Massachusetts governor if the bombing was a "false flag" attack. A false flag is a war term that refers to perpetrating an attack under the guise of the enemy for the purpose of making them look bad. Senator Elizabeth Warren and Governor Deval Patrick were both in attendance. "Why were people in the audience telling people to be calm moments before the bomb went off," the person asked, "Was this another false flag staged attack to take our civil liberties and promote Homeland Security by sticking their hands down our pants on the streets?" "No," the Governor said, "Next question." Here's the video:
Courtesy of CNNFBI agents will take the lead in the investigation into the explosions at the Boston Marathon†Monday, officials said at a press conference tonight.† "We will turn over every rock to find who is responsible for this," said Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis.† Davis confirmed that at least three people died and 130 were injured in the incident.†CNN and NBC have reported that†those who died was an 8-year-old child. Davis also debunked reports that claimed the Boston Police Department was a holding a suspect at Brigham and Women's Hospital. He would not say whether all authorities had found all of the explosive devices yet.† "No further devices have been located at this point in time," Davis said, adding, "I am not prepared to say that we are at ease at this time."† Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick†said that Boston will remain in a state of heightened security as the investigation continues.† "The city of Boston...will be open tomorrow, but it will not be business as usual," Patrick said. "Expect random checks of bags, heightened law enforcement."† At a press conference this evening, President Barack Obama†said that it was not clear who was behind the explosions, but that those responsible would "feel the full weight of justice." The White House confirmed later that the administration is considering the incident "an act of terror."† At Monday night's press conference, FBI investigator Richard DesLauriers said that "it is a criminal investigation that is a potential terrorist investigation."† The next press conference will be at 9:30 a.m. Tuesday.†
YouTube ScreengrabA shot from a 2012 SCC promo video To join China's Sports Car Club (SCC), you need two things. First, you have to be able to pay a 10,000 yuan ($1,616) annual membership fee. Second, you need access to an unbelievably expensive sports car. How expensive exactly? In 2011 Bloomberg reported that a Porsche SE 911 (sold in China for¬†$220,000) was considered entry-level at the Beijing branch ‚Äî other members had $3.9 million Tramontanas and $4.3 million Bugatti Veyron 16.4s. According to the International Business Times, one branch now requires its members to have a car better than the Porsche Carrera¬†GT, which was first sold in China during 2004 for $448,000. While it was first formed in 2009 as a simple car enthusiast club, over the years the SCC and its associated social events have become linked with the negative concept of "fuerdai" ‚Äî young second generation rich known for flaunting their wealth. The club is stirring up elements of class hatred in the communist country.  It's not totally undeserved. This month, two rumored members of the SCC began posting photos of their bank accounts online after a bizarre feud over allegations about a "sex party" at a yacht show. One bank account appeared to have over 9.9 billion yuan in it ‚Äî¬†$1.5 billion. The screenshots (which may, of course, be faked) crystallized concerns about what the club means for China. On Weibo "SCC" became the number one trending topic, according to the South China Morning Post. ‚ÄúThank you SCC,"¬†one Weibo user wrote after the scandal broke. "You make me understand that I‚Äôm not living at the bottom of this society, I live 180 floors beneath the bottom."¬† ‚ÄúBy my current income, I can become a SCC member in 1,000 years," wrote another. "That is to say, I don‚Äôt eat, drink or spend a penny in those 1,000 years.‚Äù While there are reportedly just 1,500 members of the SCC, they have an habit of making news. When the absurdly fabulous life of a young woman in Shenzhen went viral earlier this year, it didn't take long for people to realize she was an SCC member. In 2010, GQ China interviewed six Chinese twentysomething members of the¬†Sports Car Club. One notable quote came from a man dating a pretty woman, who then realized her car was ‚Äúfive years out of fashion.‚Äù ‚ÄúSecondhand goods,‚Äù the SCC member said, ditching the girl. (GQ China was later forced to pull the issue after it emerged their reporter had not made it clear they were recording the conversations for publication). Sports cars themselves have become intrinsically linked to corruption in the public imagination. Last year the 4 a.m. car crash of a $1 million Ferrari and subsequent cover-up led to the dramatic sidelining of a key Beijing politician (it's believed his son was driving the car, and may have been killed in it). One of the more light-hearted aspects of last year's Bo Xilai scandal was the constant discussion of what car his Harvard student son drives. For many Chinese citizens, the SCC and sports cars in general seem to represent the big new problem in China ‚Äî economic inequality. For example, the monthly membership fees for the SCC are almost twice the average annual salary for Beijing (based on official 2011 data). Even if a person earning this salary paid no taxes and had no other expenses, it would take them almost 50 years to buy a Porsche Carrera¬†GT at $448,000. As Lily Kuo at Quartz notes, China's Gini coefficient (a measure of income inequality) was officially 0.47 in 2012, and other studies say it could be as¬†high as 0.61. The global average is 0.44, and 0.61 would be 50 percent above the "risk level" for social unrest. Exactly how the SCC feel about being a symbol of inequality isn't clear (interview requests put in to the group were not answered). In one 2011 interview English-language interview, two members of the group were asked by a CCTV interviewer how they became so rich. They responded awkwardly, one explaining that he works in shipping and the other saying he is "running a company that's doing luxury branding and distribution." It's also worth noting that not all of the members are spoiled young fuerdai ‚Äî one magazine estimated that 30% of members were entrepreneurs themselves (the rest appeared to be second generation rich). Time Magazine spoke to Zhang Kuan, the founder of the Beijing branch, last year. Zhang came from a modest background ‚Äî his first car was a Volkswagen. "People in my generation, we always want the next thing," he told Time. "It's how we express ourselves and live our dreams."

REUTERS/Jessica RinaldiSix members of the Newtown (Conn.) Strong team who ran in Monday's Boston Marathon are safe, the group said on its Facebook page. "All runners completed the race before the explosions happened," the group said.¬† Explosions rocked the marathon¬†Monday afternoon, with more than 100 injured and at least two dead. There had been reports earlier that some Newtown families were in the grandstands at Mile 26.¬† The runners from Newtown Strong participated in the 26.2-mile marathon to honor the 26 victims of the elementary-school massacre in Newtown, Conn., last December. Marathon organizers also held a 26-second moment of silence, in honor of the victims.¬† One of the runners participating in the marathon was Laura Nowacki, a group spokesman said. Nowacki's daughter survived the December shooting. "Our Newtown team and family are okay," Nowacki wrote on her Facebook page later Monday. A spokesman for Sandy Hook Promise, another group connected to Newtown, confirmed that none of the Newtown families who attended the White House last week were in attendance in Boston on Monday.

Mamta BadkarGold has hit new lows. But for Joe Consumer, it'll be mostly shrugs. We spoke with several jewelers to talk about what impact ó if any ó plummeting prices would have for their wares, and their subsequent attractiveness for consumers. They told us few people will notice any difference at jewelry stores for three reasons. First, if you're buying a piece of jewelry for a specific occasion, a price cut is unlikely to even figure in to your purchasing decision. "You're†going to save $50 on a $4,000 piece of jewelry," Ken Walter, the owner of retailer Diamalux on Long Island, told us. "You're not going to see that much of a difference."† Another jeweler based in New York City who asked not to be identified said the final retail price for something like a gold-studded ring is most determined by the cost of craftsmanship and service than the underlying commodity. Finally, the entire jewelry industry itself remains in secular decline, according to†David Hopkinson, a gold manufacturer out of New Jersey. "Now a days jewelery doesn't have the place in the world it did 25 years ago," he said. "Electronics seem to be the hot item, everyone wants to have smartphones, $300 or $400 cell phone plans. And gas is up, so all money you want to have going to jewelery is not going there anymore."

What Falling Gold Prices Tell Us About The Stock Market (Advisor Perspectives) "At a most rudimentary level, equities are residual claims in the capital structure. Gold, on the other hand, expresses confidence in the financial system," writes Mark Ungewitter of Charter Trust Company in Advisor Perspectives. "Confidence in banks, currencies, governments and Wall Street seems necessary for a secular bull market in junior claims ‚Äì i.e. common stocks ‚Äì to occur."¬† "The behavior of gold, then, helps confirm the stock market‚Äôs secular trend.¬† A sustained move in the S&amp;P 500 above its 13-year range, corroborated by a sustained downturn in the dollar price of gold, would suggest the beginning of a new secular bull market."¬† Advisor Perspectives/Charter Trust Company Wealth Management Firms Want Advisors To Spend More Time With Clients (Financial Planning) A new survey by Ernst &amp; Young has found that wealth management firms want advisors to spend more time with their clients. 75% said they have initiatives to do just this.

Jim Rogers said the sell-off was being driven by falling gold demand in India, chartists, Cyprus and Bitcoins.¬† "I have repeatedly babbled about $1200-1300, but that is just because that would be a 30-35% correction which is normal in markets," he told Business Insider.

Tommy Belesis Charged With Fraud And Intimidation (Finra) Finra has accused Anastasios Tommy Belesis, CEO of at John Thomas Financial, and four other employees of fraud and intimidation. Finra alleges that John Thomas Financial (JTF) sold shares of America West Resources, Inc. (AWSR) "at the height of the price spike." But of the 15 customer orders received to sell over 1 million shares of America West, JTF just entered one.¬† "JTF and Belesis prevented the orders from being executed on the same day they were received and some customer orders were executed the following day or days after at prices grossly inferior to those obtained by the firm while other customer orders were not entered or executed at all. AWSR is now in bankruptcy and the customers' investments are virtually worthless.¬† "In addition, the complaint alleges that JTF and Belesis, through Misiti and Castellano, lied to the firm's registered representatives and customers about the reasons the customer shares could not be sold on Feb. 23, 2012, including that there was a problem with the clearing firm's trading systems, there was insufficient volume on that day to fill the orders, and the shares could not be sold because they were restricted under the Securities Act of 1933."
APPresident Barack Obama vowed on Monday that the U.S. will "get to the bottom" of†today's explosions at the Boston Marathon, promising those responsible "will feel the full weight of justice." "We will find out who did this, and we will hold them accountable," Obama said in the White House briefing room shortly after 6 p.m. Monday evening. Obama said that the U.S. still did not know who was behind the bombings or any motivation. According to Bloomberg, a White House official said that "any†event with multiple explosive devices ó as this appears to be ó is clearly an act of terror." Obama took a more cautious approach in his address. "We still do not know who did this or why, and people shouldn't jump to conclusions before we have all the facts," Obama said.† "The American people will say a prayer for Boston tonight," he added. Earlier today, the White House released a photo of Obama being briefed by†FBI Director Robert Mueller.

Boston Globe via GettyEye witness reports of the two explosions at the Boston marathon Monday portray a scene of terrifying chaos, with multiple reports of "trampling" at the finish line. Pennsylvania medical student Nancy Costa, who was next to the explosion, described the scene as "insane" in an interview with USA Today. "I never sprinted so fast after a marathon," Costa told USA Today. "The first (blast) threw me onto the ground. And everything went silent and then the second went off and I just covered my head and got up and started sprinting. Everyone was screaming and people were getting trampled." Rachel Sibley, 22, told ABC News that she was 50 feet away from the finish line when she heard a loud bang that sounded like a cannon. "You could see people looking up at the sky like there were fireworks, like a celebratory bang. The whole crowd waited for a moment, and then the second one went off. It was terrifying and absolute chaos," she told ABC. "Everyone needed to get out of there," said Sibley. "I was ready to just start running, otherwise I'd be tackled. You could see the panic in people's faces."
REUTERS/Jessica RinaldiThere are multiple unconfirmed reports that a person of interest is under guard in relation to¬†Monday's tragic Boston Marathon explosions.¬† There's a lot of confusion: Police commissioner Edward Davis told reporters at 18:00 EDT that authorities were NOT guarding a suspect in Mass. General. SWAT teams, police and federal agents have completely surrounded Brigham &amp; Women's Hospital in Boston, where other injured victims are being treated, according to Boston's 7News WHDH. Reporters speaking to a hospital spokesperson made it clear they believed the heavy police presence indicated they believed a suspect was being treated at the hospital. But Davis said, "there is a heavy police presence at all the hospitals ... you shouldn't read anything into to that." He said officers were there to get witness statements from victims, as well. Previously, Fox News, NBC and¬†The New York Post all report¬†that police have detained a possible suspect, though there has been no official confirmation from Boston Police. ¬† "Officials say that Boston PD are 'guarding' a wounded man at a Boston hospital as a 'possible suspect,'" NBC News tweeted on behalf of¬†Jim Miklaszewski.

Alex Trautwig/Getty ImagesFollowing two explosions at the finish line of the Boston Marathon, Boston police said during a press conference there was a third explosion at Boston's JFK library that appears to be related to a fire. Police said during a press conference just before 5 p.m. that the explosion at JFK library occurred at roughly 4:30. It appears the blast might have been related to a 3 p.m. fire inside JFK library that the  the Dorchester Reporter reported was not related to the marathon explosions. The AP tweeted earlier that an intelligence official said two unexploded devices were found at the marathon. Time's Andrew Katz tweeted earlier that police were investigating reports of bombs in other parts of the city. Citing a police scanner, Katz tweeted before the 5 p.m. press conference that there was an "incendiary device" possible at JFK Library as well as "another device" in front of Boston's luxury Mandarin hotel. Boston Phoenix reporter Chris Faraone tweets a police officer near the finish line said this: "There are secondary devices that have been found and are unexploded." The police scanner said that police were going to do a third, controlled explosion on the 600 block of Boylston Street.

boston-to-a-T on twitter.com There have been multiple explosions at the finish line for the Boston Marathon, with reports of at least dozens of injuries and a number of deaths. Two explosion occurred on Boylston Street near the intersections of Fairfield and Exeter streets just before 3 p.m. EST. Boston Police have confirmed that three people have died as a result of the blasts, while a recent CNN report says that more than 140 have been injured, with more than 10 amputations. CNN and NBC report that one of those who died was an 8-year-old child. The New York Post reports that 12 are dead and dozens more are injured, but it should be noted that this number has not been confirmed by other sources. At a press conference this evening, President Barack Obama said that it was not clear who was behind the explosions, but that they would be held responsible. The F.B.I. is currently leading the investigation. Reporters on the scene¬†say they saw at least dozens of injuries and lost limbs. TV crews are showing images with lots of blood on the ground. "There are people who are really, really bloody," runner Laura McLean of Toronto told the AP. "They were pulling them into the medical tent." "It was just an explosion, it came out of nowhere,"¬†Boston.com sports producer Steve Silva, who was at the scene, said. "There are multiple injuries. I saw dismemberment, I saw blood everywhere. People are badly injured." At the time of writing, law enforcement officials have not commented on what caused the explosions. However, one law enforcement source has told NBC news that it was caused by at least one IED (improvised explosive device) and the Boston Marathon Facebook page has an update that refers to two bombs.  There have been multiple reports police are investigating the possibility of more explosive devices in different locations in Boston. The New York Times reports that one source told them two other explosive devices were found, and the WSJ reported that five other possible devices had been found, though they later said that police were unsure about these. At a press conference, Boston Police Department confirmed that there was also a fire at JFK Library this afternoon but it is unclear if it is related. CBS News has reported that police have an image of a "suspect,"¬†while the New York Post says they have confirmation an injured individual suspected of involvement is in custody. However, the Boston police have told Talking Points Memo that no one has been arrested yet. Fox News reports that it has been confirmed that a "person of interest" is in custody, but it has not been confirmed if the man was the perpetrator or a victim.¬† WABC-TV also reports that police are looking for a suspect, described as a "darker skinned or black male with a black backpack and black sweatshirt, possibly foreign national from the accent of the individual."

It has its own 200 foot private beach, and if that's not enough there also the vaulted cathedral ceilings, wood burning fireplace, and gorgeous cedar deck where you can enjoy the ocean view should be decent draws. The house is going for $5.9 million and Maggie Keats of Douglas Elliman has the listing.
YouTube ScreengrabRhetoric from North Korea has ratcheted up following a short respite to throw a party for the country's founder. From Yonhap News: North Korea's military on Tuesday issued an "ultimatum" saying it would launch retaliation against South Korea without warning if "anti-North Korean" activities continue in the South. The war games are annual, bilateral training between South Korea (ROK) forces and U.S. forces ‚Äî over the years the training has become totally routine, and so has the blustering response of North Korean officials. Experts have pointed out that much of what Kim Jong-Un says could be with the aim of consolidating power internally. Kim could be setting himself up to claim his tough talk prevented a possible U.S. invasion, using propaganda to paint the war games as the South's attempt to prep for crossing the Demilitarized Zone into the North. He may take a high-profile victory lap come April 30, when the games end. Daniel Pinkston,¬†who focuses on North Korea for the¬†International Crisis Group,¬†told¬†NPR¬†recently that¬†North Korea "will say that 'look, the Americans were really going to invade us. They were preparing for it and they ran away scared because of our nuclear deterrent [and] our great commander. ... Now we can celebrate.'"
Dealbook screengrabEarlier we did a post on the phenomenon of "Goldenfreude" which means taking pleasure at the collapse in gold prices. We asked a bunch of notable names why they thought gold falling inspired such glee. One of the responses we got was from Paul Krugman, whose answer was pretty solid: Well, the inflationistas/goldbugs are really, really annoying -- all this air of having the secret wisdom when they actually haven't a clue. And they have been a real destructive factor in policy debate, standing in the way of effective policy by raising fears of Weimar and Zimbabwe. So seeing the one thing they got right -- betting on higher gold prices -- turn sour is cause for a bit of celebration. For more on goldenfreude, see here &gt;
Screenshot via Bloomberg TVGold has been taking a battering all day. Gold is off 8.5% to $1,373.80 an ounce. Commodities guru Jim Rogers isn't buying gold yet. He told Business Insider there were four key things driving the sell-off. Rogers said he hasn't hedged his positions at the moment. "I have repeatedly babbled about $1200-1300, but that is just because that would be a 30-35% correction which is normal in markets," he told Business Insider. "But I am a hopeless market timer/trader." Rogers said he expects gold prices to fall further for the "foreseeable future" but expects "gold to eventually go higher over the decade."
Venture capitalist†John Doerr has been taking a good deal of ribbing for admitting that he likes to wear Google Glass while playing the game Scattergories with his family. The New York Times' Claire Cain Miller†wondered if that was allowed. "It is questionable whether that follows the game's rules," she wrote.† Computer security legend, Bruce Schneier, decided it isn't allowed. "Questionable? Questionable?" He wrote today on his blog. "It just like using a computer's dictionary while playing Scrabble, or a computer odds program while playing poker, or a computer chess program while playing an in-person game. There's no question at all -- it's cheating." Schneier then pointed out, "We're seeing the birth of a new epithet, 'glasshole.'" Urban Dictionary, keeper of all things meme, already has a definition for it.†"Glasshole" means†"a person who constantly talks to their Google Glass, ignoring the outside world."
APA few weeks ago, we figured out what was happening to the Ron Paul portfolio ‚Äî the former Texas congressman's 64% investment in gold and other rocks ‚Äî and it wasn't pretty. His portfolio is comprised of major miners and a handful of juniors, and displays a marked lack of diversification.¬† Investment manager William Bernstein told the Wall Street Journal that ‚ÄúThis portfolio is a half-step away from a cellar-full of canned goods and nine-millimeter rounds.‚Äù¬† We looked at Ron Paul's most-recently disclosed portfolio. Granted, he may have picked up the stocks at any point in the past several years, so he's probably still above water on the investments. It's also conceivable that since he's left public life he's pared back a lot on his holdings. So we're just going based on what's public. Still, these have taken a shellacking, and it's likely that he's lost a significant percent of his net worth, assuming he's held on to them over the past six months. Here's what has happened: Given that The Wall Street Journal¬†reported that Paul's portfolio was worth between $2.44 million and $5.46 million ‚Äî and that 64 percent of his assets were in these precious metal stocks ‚Äî a¬†very¬†loose estimate is that¬†Ron Paul has lost between $624,640 and $1,397,760 over the past six months, based on the average loss of his mining holdings. This assumes a 40.3% loss on 64% of his holdings.  A lot of that pain has come in the past two days alone. Here's what has happened to the portfolio since last Thursday: Pretty bleak.
Academic, who was sacked for claiming that horse riding was as safe as taking ecstasy, said abuse of cocaine caused the financial meltdown. The former Government drugs tsar, Professor David Nutt, has said the financial crisis was caused by too many bankers taking cocaine. The controversial academic, who was sacked for claiming that ecstasy was as safe as horse riding, told the Sunday Times that abuse of cocaine caused the financial meltdown. "Bankers use cocaine and got us into this terrible mess," he told the paper adding that the drug made them "overconfident" and led to them taking more risks. Nutt, who is professor of neuropsychopharmacology at Imperial College, claimed that cocaine was perfect for a banking "culture of excitement and drive and more and more and more. It is a 'more' drug". He goes on to claim in the interview that abuse of cocaine led to the financial meltdown, "and the Barings crash". Prof Nutt was sacked from his role as the Government‚Äôs most senior drugs advisor in 2009 following the publication of a paper in which he argued there was "not much difference" between the harm caused by riding a horse and taking ecstasy. He also claimed that ecstasy and LSD were less harmful than alcohol. His most recent foray into the drugs debate was equally controversial. Last week he attacked the Government over the laws dealing with magic mushrooms, ecstasy and cannabis, which he claims hinder medical research. Magic mushrooms were banned in 2005. Prof Nutt said he deems the laws surrounding mushrooms "absurd" and "insane" and says it makes it hard to procure one of their ingredients - psilocybin, which is used to treat depression. The Home Office countered that there was no evidence that regulations were a barrier to research. Prof Nutt told the BBC: "We have regulations which are 50 years old, have never been reviewed and they are holding us back, they're stopping us doing the science and I think it's a disgrace actually." 
Reuters/Mike SegarGold skeptics often warn that the yellow metal has no intrinsic value. But that's a bit of an exaggeration. In addition to its use in jewelery, gold has many practical real world uses too. The folks at U.S. Global Investors put together this slideshow to illustrate some of the uses of gold. Thanks to U.S. Global Investors for allowing us to feature this presentation. Goldís qualities make it one of the most coveted metals in the world. Not only can it be beautifully shaped and sculpted, the yellow metal conducts electricity and does not tarnish. These qualities make it the metal of choice for a wide variety of industries. Letís take a look at some industrial, medical and technological uses of gold, some of which are truly amazing. Source: U.S. Global Investors Gold has been used in dentistry for nearly 3,000 years. The first book published on dentistry, entitled Artzney Buchlein, appeared in 1530. The book suggests dentists fill cavities and rotten teeth with gold leaf.

Gold contained in connectors, switches and relay contacts allows phones to remain free of corrosion. Source: U.S. Global Investors According to the World Gold Council, a single mobile device contains up to 50 milligrams of gold. Thatís a tiny amount but nearly 1 billion cell phones are produced each year. With a gold value of about 50 cents in each phone, that adds up to $500 million dollars in gold each year!

Lion Air, the Indonesian budget carrier whose Boeing 737-800 crashed at a Bali airport on Saturday, has been banned from flying in the European Union since 2007 after being deemed "unsafe." While Indonesia's aviation market is expanding at a rate of 21%¬†annually, the crash of the Lion Air flight in Bali ‚Äî the country's fourth since January 2012 ‚Äî highlights a poor safety record. All 51 Indonesian airlines were banned from flying in the EU in 2007 after a series of fatal accidents, including the March 2007 crash of Garuda Indonesia Flight 200, which killed 21 passengers and one crew member. In 2009, the EU lifted the ban on four of those airlines, including Garuda, and the delegation that made the decision said Lion Air could be taken off the list by the end of that year, the New York Times reported. But the¬†most recent update of the blacklist, published in December 2012, included the budget carrier. The Federal Aviation Administration does not rate, rank, or blacklist airlines, but it has assessed the Indonesian Directorate General of Civil aviation "as not being in compliance" with international safety standards. The State Department suggests Americans traveling to Indonesia avoid local carriers: Indonesian air carriers continue to experience air incidents and accidents. U.S. citizens traveling to and from Indonesia are encouraged to fly directly to their destinations on international carriers from countries whose civil aviation authorities meet international aviation safety standards for the oversight of their air carrier operations under the FAA's International Aviation Safety Assessment (IASA) program. Lion Air operates mostly domestic flights, its international destinations include Vietnam and Thailand. The fast-growing operator announced in March that it would buy 234 A320 jets from Airbus for $24 billion, its biggest deal ever. None of the 108 passengers or crew members onboard this week's crashed Bali were killed, though dozens were injured. The pilots have passed drug and alcohol tests, and investigators suspect an unusual weather phenomenon called "wind shear" may have caused the accident.
Gold is getting destroyed today. In fact, the entire commodity complex is selling off pretty hard. Stocks are also coming under heavy selling pressure, and unlike commodities, they are currently making new intraday lows. Right now, the S&amp;P 500 is down 1.5 percent, trading around $1564 (and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 185 points). Thinkorswim The biggest laggards today probably won't surprise anyone ñ they are mostly part of the bigger commodities theme. Freeport MacMoRan, the gold miner, is down 7.3%, while Cliffs Natural Resources is down 5.9% and Pioneer Natural Resources is 5.4% lower. Meanwhile, homebuilders are getting hit too. PulteGroup is down 5.3%, and DR Horton is down 5.0%. Earlier this morning, NAHB's monthly index of homebuilder sentiment unexpectedly fell.
Houston Rockets owner Leslie Alexander is sending out exclusive invitations this week to his luxury Bridgehampton wine club, SociÈtÈ du Vin, the†New York Post†reports. Opened last year before the end of the Hamptons season, SociÈtÈ du Vin is a "wine country club" where the wealthy can store their vintage wines and hang out. The 10,000-square-foot space was once an old potato barn. It was gut renovated and decorated by Hollywood set director Elvis Restaino for $5 million with seating, chandeliers, and TVs, according to The New York Times. It will be open nine months out of the year, and (almost) round the clock so members can access their wines whenever they choose, Alexander told The NYT. Membership to the exclusive social club will set you back $50,000, plus annual dues of $8,000. Besides wine storage, members will be privy to events and tastings by invitation in the salon room, or they can go to SociÈtÈ du Vin to simply watch games on the flat screen TVs and relax while sipping their vintages. Enrollment is limited to 100 members, according to the Times, and The Post reports that Alexander will send out invitations to 75 people. "Out here in the Hamptons, most people who own wine cellars are a little older, and they don't go to discos, and there's no place to go after a restaurant on a Saturday night."†Alexander told Curtis Dahl of Joseph &amp; Curtis Custom Wine Cellars†in an online video. "This gives them the opportunity to go out and meet friends, meet wine people, and store their wine in a great place." The club will reopen over Memorial Day next month.
REUTERS/Jorge SilvaVenezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro raises his fist next to a painting of President Hugo Chavez during the commemoration of the 21st anniversary of Chavez's attempted coup d'etat in Caracas February 4, 2013. Chavez is still in Cuba recovering from a cancer surgery and has not been seen in public since December 8 last year. Last night, Venezuela elected former bus driver Nicolas Maduro President by a more narrow margin than anyone expected, 50.66% to 49.07%.  As late President Hugo Chavez's successor and candidate for the reigning socialist party (the PSUV), Maduro enjoyed massive advantages in terms of media and political influence during the election. Now his mandate is less clear, and there's going to be a recount of 100% of the votes. That said: It is shocking that Chavez's massive cult of personality¬†didn't hand Maduro his victory on a silver platter (Venezuelans lined up to get Chavez tattoos before voting, for example), but a win is still a win. This puts Wall Street in a weird place. A Maduro win had been priced in for the most part, but since the political process is still in motion and things are a bit uncertain, all is quiet in Venezuelan currency markets. There are two things that could set the market off though, a Latin American currency trader told Business Insider. The first is any indication from anyone that the Petrocaribe energy agreement may be modified. If you're not familiar, it's an agreement between Venezuela and 17 Latin American nations that allows participating nations to buy Venezuelan oil at a steep subsidy. In exchange, countries like the Dominican Republic and Cuba send Venezuela items that have become scarce in the country, like food and medicine. The end of Petrocaribe, or even a limitation of the supply of oil that could be sent abroad, would impact trade all over the region. Venezuela's economy may need to see an end to the agreement, however. The country has already undergone two currency devaluations this year to narrow its fiscal deficit. Analysts have said time and time again that the government will have to make difficult choices about cutting domestic programs that are very popular like homebuilding campaigns and cash handouts for poor mothers. From Reuters: "We're going to see a reduction in government spending, most notably in the home construction program, and the devaluation is also going to limit growth," said Angel Garcia of consulting firm Econometrica, which is critical of the government. "It's going to be a year of inflation with stagnant growth." The next issue that could keep traders up at night is the USD to Bolivar (VEF) exchange rate in the Ancillary Foreign Currency Administration System (SICAD). If you haven't heard of SICAD, it's because it's a uniquely Venezuelan system. SICAD is a third bond market (outside the official and black markets) through which investors can buy Venezuelan bonds. It's the second incarnation of SITME, a bond swap market founded in 2010 and discontinued earlier this year. SITME died with Venezuela's currency devaluation in February. At the time, SITME valued the VEF to USD exchange at 5.3 VEF per USD. The official USD-VEF rate after devaluation went from 4.3 to 6.3. The government created SICAD to fall in line with the new VEF rate, though some investors complain that it's "confusing and cumbersome." Last month, the country had its first SICAD sale among 383 corporate bidders (yes, only certain investors can use SICAD) last month. The rate was not publicized, and in a note, Barclays said that isn't a good sign. From El Universal: "First explanation about why the (Venezuelan) government did not announce the price of the first auction at Sicad seems to be a significant devaluation of the currency," the investment bank hypothesized in a note. Traders told Business Insider that, from what they can see, the SICAD exchange rate was 6.30, not too far away from the Central Bank rate of 6.2845. Still, the government is holding its cards close to its chest. Wild movements in the newly minted SICAD could send investors scurrying. One sign that current uncertainty is making an impact ‚Äî right now the exchange rate on the black market is four times the official rate, says Reuters. That is in part because whether Maduro is declared the winner or not, there's still plenty of reason to think things could still get rocky in Venezuela. According to global research group IHS, his weak mandate could not only spark confrontation between the social and opposition parties, but also between factions within the socialist party. From IHS: If Capriles refuses to recognize Maduro's victory, the new president's legitimacy will be questioned and the shadow of a possible electoral fraud would add to the economic and social challenges that he will have to face in the next year, including dealing with increasing inflation, crime and corruption, and shortages of food, medicines, basic goods, and even electricity and water. Political stability is not guaranteed in Venezuela after Maduro's election... especially if Maduro fails to keep the different factions of the PSUV united. Ch√°vez's death was a game changer for Venezuela and has led to a gradual process of reorganization of the political order. The deterioration of Maduro's leadership and the fragmentation of the PSUV are likely to take place after his first year in office if he fails to deal efficiently with the economic and social issues facing Venezuelans. So traders should enjoy this break, it may be there last one for a while.
The big news of the day is that gold is getting slammed. Gold tanked more than 7% to trade below $1,400 an ounce during Monday's session. People are probably wondering how John Paulson, the closely-followed hedge fund manager who famously bet against subprime, is doing. Paulson has been massively long gold and gold-related stocks. We combed through his latest 13F filing and those gold stocks are getting hammered today. The numbers below are based on his fund's most recent quarterly filing for the fourth quarter of 2012.¬†
Gold prices are tumbling deeper into bear market territory. As the gold bugs suffer, Nouriel "Dr. Doom" Roubini is only piling on. He tweets: Gold Bugs &amp; @jamesgrickards in stupefied catatonic state as gold now has fallen from a peak of $1950 in 2011 to $1350 today. Eat your gold!
The chart below, via @Macro_Tourist, shows how notable the big sell-off in gold over the past few sessions has been, even when one takes a long-term perspective (the chart goes all the way back to 1792). On the other hand, the shiny yellow metal has, of course, had a nice run over that time period...

Institutional Investor's Alpha has released its 12th annual rich list, which ranks the top-earning hedge fund managers for the year.¬† According to Institutional Investor's Alpha's analysis, the 25 highest earning hedge fund managers brought in a combined $14.14 billion in 2012. That's the lowest total since 2008. Fund managers are paid through a compensation structure commonly known as the "2 and 20", which stands for a 2% management fee and a 20% performance fee charge. Those numbers can, however, vary from fund to fund. More specifically, two and twenty means hedge fund manager would charge 2% of total assets under management and 20% of any profits. The fund managers also likely have their own capital invested in their funds so that would have to be taken into consideration when calculating their take home pay. David Tepper,¬†the founder of $12 billion-distressed-debt hedge fund Appaloosa Management, made it to the top of the list. There were four fund managers whose take-home pay was over a billion.
By:¬† Peter Schiff Monday, April 15, 2013 In the opening years of the last decade, most mainstream investors sat on the sidelines while "tin hat" goldbugs rode the bull market from below $300 to just over $1,000 per ounce.¬† But following the 2008 financial crisis, when gold held up better than stocks during the decline and made new record highs long before the Dow Jones fully recovered, Wall Street finally sat up and took notice. The new devotees helped to push gold to nearly $1,900 by September of 2011. ¬† For the next year and a half it held relatively steady, trading mostly between $1,500 and $1,800 as more mainstream investors caught the fever.¬† But now it appears that the brief love affair is at an end. It was really only a flirtation as the two were never a good match in the first place. ¬†Gold's new suitors never understood the fundamental case for gold and now they are turning their affection back to their true love: U.S. equities.¬† This is creating a brutal season for gold investors. The metal is in the midst of its largest pull back in nearly five years, and as the selling has gathered momentum powerful Wall Street voices as diverse as Goldman Sachs and George Soros have declared the end of its nearly fifteen year run of dominance. ¬†¬† The story line put out by most of these analysts is that gold shined as a safe haven during the Great Recession, but its allure has evaporated with the recent "improvements" in the global economy, particularly in the United States. Ironically, this ignores the fact that gold actually performed better in the years leading up to the 2008 financial crisis than it did during or following the crisis.¬†That may be because the inflationary monetary policy that fueled the housing bubble also powered gold.¬† Deflation fears led to gold's 35% decline in 2008, but once the Fed reopened the monetary spigots gold rallied to new highs. But in 2008 gold fell in concert with nearly every other asset class. This time, it's falling while other assets are rising. The negative spotlight makes the current decline potentially more meaningful. ¬† ¬† Neither the new round of Keynesian expansion in Japan nor the recent fallout from the Cypriot solvency crisis produced gold rallies. Bears cite these failures as the signs that the bull is dead. The latest warning bell came late last week when the Bank of Cyprus announced that it would be selling its gold reserves in order to raise the cash to pay its debts. Concerns quickly spread that other heavily indebted Mediterranean countries with large gold reserves like Greece, Portugal, Italy and Spain would follow suit.¬†The tidal wave of selling would be expected to be the coup de grace for gold's glory years. While this neat narrative may be sufficient to convince the financial media that an historic shift is underway, wiser minds will see more nuance. ¬† ¬† While the vast majority of economists see gold as the "barbarous relic" described by Keynes, the sentiment has not stopped many central bankers from holding huge quantities as currency reserves. It is a curious phenomenon that the countries with the most daunting debt problems have the highest percentage of gold in their foreign exchange reserves. Many of these countries were formerly prosperous, and at various points in their histories had gold-backed currencies that required large reserves. These legacy assets now account for the bulk of their reserve wealth. ¬† The United Stated leads the pack with both the largest amount of gold in reserve (8,133 tons) and one of the highest percentages (76%). Other heavily indebted developed countries are not far behind: Italy has 2,450 tons and 72% of reserves, France has 2,435 tons and 71% reserves, Portugal has 382 tons and 90% reserves, and Greece has 112 tons and 82% reserves. Tiny Cyprus, whose travails are creating global ripples, has just 14 tons (58% of reserves). ¬† In contrast, the quickly developing emerging market economies are conspicuous for very small gold reserves, particularly in comparison to their much larger reserves of foreign currencies. Many of these countries have generated large amounts of U.S. dollar reserves as a result of ongoing trade surpluses. While China has more than 1,000 tons of gold, the cache only represents 2% of their enormous foreign exchange coffers.¬†¬†Even gold loving India has just 10%. Neither Russia, Taiwan, Thailand, Singapore, Mexico, South Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, nor Brazil has more than 10% (with most having far less than 5%). Bankers and political leaders in all of these countries, particularly India and China, have lamented publicly about the very high percentage of U.S. dollars in their reserves, and have even spoken fondly about the reliability and importance of gold. ¬† The heavy debtors in the Eurozone have few pleasant options to deal with their insolvency. As illustrated by Cyprus, the choices may come down to painful austerity or raiding supposedly sacred bank deposits. The sale of gold reserves may provide a much more palatable option for politicians. After all, do voters really care how much gold sits in national vaults? For now at least, international central bank gold agreements limit the amount of gold that they can sell in a given year. But as these sovereign debt crises deepen for countries like Italy and Portugal, many justly question how long these paper agreements will keep the selling pressure at bay.¬† While I believe that they may indeed succumb to the temptation, such moves may not be disruptive, or even negative for gold. Large divestitures by some countries may lead to corresponding accumulations cash rich, but gold poor, creditor nations like India, China, Russia, and Indonesia.¬† Such transactions would likely take place through private, direct, and tightly communicated sales. As a result, they would be far less disruptive than would be the case were they to occur in relatively thinly traded public markets as many now fear. ¬† Such a transfer in gold holdings would be the logical result of the drift of the global economy over the past half century. Despite its current disfavor, gold is real wealth. Governments and bankers know this. As the emerging economies gain wealth, and the developed countries dissipate wealth through welfare-state debt accumulation, it is inevitable that the gold follows. It's not a question of if, but when. ¬†¬† While nations buying gold will pay for their purchases with dollars, the sellers will not re-invest the proceeds into Treasuries.¬†Dollars raised through gold sales will be converted to local currency and used to repay debt. This will put downward pressure on both the U.S. dollar and Treasuries. In addition, emerging market central bankers will be more likely to hold onto gold for the long-term, thereby providing a bullish impact on the market. In essence, such a shift would flush out the weak hands who don't have the resources to protect their wealth in favor of stronger hands that do. ¬† ¬† Creditor nations that buy gold cheap from bankrupt nations forced to sell at distressed prices will see the value of their reserves swell, thereby gaining the independence and confidence they need to finally break their reliance on the U.S. dollar as their principal reserve asset. When the reign of "king dollar" finally comes to a belated end,¬†let's hope all the gold we allegedly have stored in Fort Knox is actually there. We're going to need every ounce of it.

YoutubeIt's gold, Jerry!Gold is down nearly 8 percent this morning. Some say it's a conspiracy.† But those who actually deal in day-to-day buying and selling of physical gold products aren't convinced the rout will last. We spoke with both retailers and manufacturers.† They said there's been too much fluctuation in recent years to call any trend on such a short-term price change. "It's gone up and down quite a bit over the last two years, so I'm not optimistic that it's going to stay down," John Comerford, owner of Robbinsville, N.J.-based†Basil Ltd. which retails Irish and Celtic-inspired jewelery, told us.† David Hopkinson, a manufacturer also out of New Jersey, said he believes there's too much speculation in the gold market to say where prices will head.† "No one truly knows what drives it," he said.  He compared the gold market to oil. "Fuel, you only pass paper, then turn it around. You're moving paper. If people actually had to take possession of what they're trading, it might change things, wouldn't be such speculative price."† Some manufacturers are diving in to take advantage of the drop. Ibrahim Fadl, a wholesale merchant (and the guy who discovered Tungsten-filled gold bars†were circulating on Manhattan's Jeweler's Row), said he's already taken an order to buy one kilogram of gold. Producers are telling him they were blindsided by the move.† Basil's Comerford believes there's been too much central bank asset purchasing to keep gold down for long. "I'm worried about the U.S. dollar. If it continues to fall in value, the only thing that will retain its value is gold, which would drive that back up." Meanwhile, consumers shouldn't expect to see lower prices filter through to retail any time soon, Comerford said. "Our prices from our vendors wouldn't change day to day, week to week," he said. "It might alter prices over a six or 12 month period, but we're†not going to be able to step in because gold went down."
REUTERS/Jorge Dan Lopez Gold is absolutely getting wrecked. Its 2-day loss is over 10%. We haven't seen a decline like that since 1980. We already explained why the gold crash is good news, because it represents a turn away from rocks, and towards humanity. But there's something else going on, which can only be described as "Goldenfreude", the pleasure of seeing gold fans lose money. Pleasure at the misfortune of others is a bad thing that should be discouraged, but from time to time, people can't help themselves. So why does Goldenfreude exist? We asked a few of our favorite pundits/investors/talking heads to explain it. The pseudonymous trader @pawelmorski (who wrote a great post on the gold decline) explained that part of it is a reaction to the constant goldbug religious hectoring while others seriously discuss and address economic problems. Policymakers have spent the last 5 years stumbling around trying to build ad hoc solutions to unprecedented problems. It gets tiring being accused of being a sheep or an apologist whenever you try to assess the likely outcome of policy steps, especially when the abuse comes from people who refuse to address such basic points as what debasement actually means, or refuse to follow through the logic of what a gold standard might imply for the real economy. All of which recognises that thereís still a risk that this could all go horribly wrong. I can certainly see why people would favour an asset like gold as a hedge against tail events, and I get frustrated at the refusal to distinguish between an investment decision and a massive paradigm change in monetary policy. Bloomberg TelevisionBarry Ritholtz of the Big Picture explained the goldenfreude phenomenon more bluntly: The cocksuredness of the goldbugs is surely part of it.†††† The other factor is the way Goldbugs disguise their narratives in non-verifiable† forecasts and predictions ñ that plus the fear mongering. Atlantic economics writer Matthew O'Brien had a slightly different take, explaining how the gold decline exposes something that everyone likes to see: The man on a lucky hot streak suddenly realizing he's not that good. It's like seeing the guy on a hot streak at the craps table who thinks that shows he's somehow smarter/better. Eddy Elfenbein of Crossing Wall Street†explains the phenomenon as a much-needed pushback against people who have been unopposed: It's because there's little push back against the absurd disaster scenarios that have been peddled in recent years. People used the price of gold to confirm their political views. Today is like a real doctor coming along to treat a patient as a witchdoctor stands by in disbelief. And Josh Brown of The Reformed Broker says people are just sick of hearing the "we're all screwed" message over and over: Personally, I take no pride in seeing anyone lose money, but I think the goldenfreude stems from the fact that the people trying to live normal lives within the system have grown weary of the the narrative that "we're all screwed anyway" and so the mocking is a backlash. Also, the proponents of being loaded with gold have tended to be the biggest blowhards in the room. Now, you don't have to be an asshole to write to an end-of-the-world newsletter - but it helps. And Paul Krugman adds: Well, the inflationistas/goldbugs are really, really annoying -- all this air of having the secret wisdom when they actually haven't a clue. And they have been a real destructive factor in policy debate, standing in the way of effective policy by raising fears of Weimar and Zimbabwe. So seeing the one thing they got right -- betting on higher gold prices -- turn sour is cause for a bit of celebration. So basically, people are tired of being harassed, and they're glad to see a group that's been blabbering unfalsiable stuff for so long get some comeuppance.
REUTERS/Claro Cortes IVGold entered bear market territory last week. It is down over 7.0% today, and is trading below $1,400 per ounce today. Dennis Gartman, publisher of the Gartman Letter wrote that in nearly four decades of trading gold, he had "never... ever... ever... seen anything like what we've witnessed in the past two trading sessions." This is bad news for central banks that have been diversifying their foreign reserves to include gold. Global official gold holdings totaled 31,694.8 tonnes as of April 2013, according to the latest report from the World Gold Council. We pulled the numbers on the 10 biggest official reserves.

Flickr - ollesvenssonGold has captured a lot of the attention in the past few trading sessions, but prices across the commodity complex are tanking. Unlike Friday, when metals and energy commodities took a big hit ‚Äì but agricultural commodities held up ‚Äì all three parts of the commodity complex are coming under heavy selling to start the week. Right now, oil is down 3.5 percent to levels around $88.10 a barrel. Here's a run-through of today's damage across the commodity space:
There are two big emerging economic stories coming out of the U.S. There's the American energy boom, which will be driven by drillers tapping American shale. And there's the American manufacturing renaissance, which is supposed to be driven by rising overseas labor costs and falling domestic energy costs (thanks to the energy boom). But so far, there's little evidence to suggest the manufacturing renaissance is underway. Goldman Sachs' economist Jan Hatzius recently argued that if we were experiencing a manufacturing comeback fueled by cheap energy, then we'd see energy intensive industries outperform in its sector.† But it's not.† Here's Hatzius' chart: Goldman Sachs Part of the reason for this may be the fact that energy costs are actually very small relative to every other cost in manufacturing. Deutsche Banks' Peter Hooper makes this point in a new research note: Manufacturing to benefit, but energy is relatively small input. There is scope for the industrial sector to benefit from lower natural gas prices, as oil still has about a 50% share of energy use in that sector, down from 55% in 2006. And there has been a lot of discussion recently about the possible boom in US manufacturing in response to lower energy prices caused by the shale revolution. Anecdotally, there have been reports of plants relocating to the US to take advantage of lower energy costs. We would expect the most energy- intensive manufacturing industries to benefit most from the shale energy revolution, including petroleum and coal, chemical, paper, and printing, among other industries (Chart 17). However, given that energy products account for a relatively small share of total output in these industries, we would express some caution about forecasting a US manufacturing revolution based on lower energy prices alone. Deciding on a plant location is a complex decision that considers not only input costs but the location of demand as well. While US manufacturing will surely benefit from rising global labor costs and lower energy prices, the relatively low energy intensity of a number of manufacturing industries suggests that the shale energy revolution may have a more muted impact on the overall US economy. Here's Hooper's chart: Deutsche Bank
Jonathan Alcorn / Bloomberg via Getty ImagesDish CEO Charlie Ergen. In a surprise move, satellite-TV operator Dish Network has made a $26 billion bid for Sprint, the U.S.'s third-largest wireless operator. Sprint is already in the approval process to sell a majority stake to Japanese telecommunications firm Softbank. Dish's bid is higher than Softbank's and may therefore trigger a bidding war between the two suitors. Dish has offered about $7 a share for Sprint, with a mix of cash ($4.74 per share) and $2.26-worth of Dish stock. Dish's stock fell about 5% on the news, and the total value of the offer will continue to fluctuate based on Dish's stock price. Dish estimated that the initial offer was worth about 13% more than Softbank's offer. The ultimate fate of Sprint, and the price of the winning deal, won't likely be known for months.¬† But Dish's bid represents the next big move in a tectonic shift that is revolutionizing the media and communications business. Right now, the communications and media industries are dominated by six big groups of companies: These groups of companies are all massive. And, until recently, they all operated within their own competitive silos. But now that's all changing. Now, thanks to the Internet, they're all smashing into one another in a slow-motion tectonic collision. In the past decade, several of these groups of companies have moved into one another's businesses, either through acquisition or by launching secondary services. Cable operators like Cablevision, Comcast, and Time Warner Cable, for example, have launched land-line phone services and begun marketing them with broadband Internet through popular "triple plays." Landline telephone companies like Verizon have launched broadband Internet and cable TV services, competing directly with cable's bundles. Cable operators have bought huge content companies (Comcast and NBC Universal). Internet services companies like Google have begun offering high-speed Internet access services. And so on. And now, in the next stage of the industry's evolution, cable and satellite-TV companies are starting to team up with wireless carriers. The goal of this latest trend is to be able to offer a single subscription that provides all content and communications services everywhere. In a world in which people are increasingly using multiple devices in multiple places to communicate with each other and consume content, this is obviously a service whose time has come. Why would a consumer maintain separate and limited subscriptions with a phone company, a wireless company, a pay-TV company, and a broadband Internet company if a single company could provide all of this for one simple price? Answer: Most consumers wouldn't. So it's not hard to imagine that, within a decade, we'll all be able to buy all of these services from massive integrated telecommunications services companies. Dish's bid for Sprint is a step toward that future. Dish wants to combine its satellite service and wireless "spectrum" licenses with Sprint's cellular capabilities and offer consumers a single subscription that takes care of their communications needs at home and on the go. The service would allow customers to communicate, use the Internet, and consume a full range of TV content with any device anywhere. Providing the mobile piece of this service would be relatively easy. Dish would simply have to extend its agreements with TV content companies to cover mobile distribution and then stream this content to customers on their mobile devices. Providing the "home" solution could be more complicated. A consumer's mobile devices could certainly also be used in the home. But one challenge for the Dish-Sprint combination would be providing enough wireless bandwidth to the home that customers who unplugged their physical cable-broadband wires could watch a large amount of full high-definition video at home. Cable TV and high-definition Internet video both use massive amounts of bandwidth, and although wireless speeds are now perfectly adequate for video consumption, wireless carrying capacity is not.¬† Watching a single high-definition movie, for example, could chew through the data allowance for a standard "mobile data" subscription. And consumers who have gotten used to watching as many movies as they want with cable TV and a cable broadband subscription would likely balk at suddenly having to worry about how much video they consumed. Obviously, Dish already offers an excellent "downstream" pay-TV service to its satellite customers, and it could presumably continue to offer this. But merging this service with wireless Internet video in a single, seamless bundle could be challenging. And if satellite delivery becomes a critical part of the DISH-Sprint home solution, this would require new subscribers to replace their cable connections with satellite dishes. So even if Dish succeeds in taking over Sprint, the "Holy Grail" of a single communications service may still be a ways off. But it's coming. And when it arrives, it will change the telecom and media industries forever.
You'll hear adherents of technical analysis talk a lot about the 200-day moving average. When the price of a financial asset ñ like gold, for example ñ falls below its average price over the last 200 days, it indicates increasingly bearish sentiment toward the asset. The gold price actually dropped below its 200-day moving average back in early February, when it was trading around $1667 an ounce. Today, as Stifel Nicolaus strategist Dave Lutz points out, gold has also broken below its 200-week†moving average, which currently hovers around $1435. The price of gold hasn't been below its 200-week moving average since 2001. It's not necessarily a critical level that a lot of traders are watching, but it does illustrate just how bearish sentiment toward the shiny yellow metal has become in recent days. Bloomberg, Business Insider
The brutal gold crash continues. When we posted the chart below it was at $1384. Now it's down to $1363. Kitco.com
Up until last week, Deutsche Bank's commodities team, led by Daniel Brebner, had the highest price forecasts for gold of anyone on Wall Street. Despite the steady stream of negative sentiment toward gold from other investment shops in recent months ñ including a wave of price target downgrades and declarations of "the end of the gold era" ñ the Deutsche Bank strategists maintained their targets for an average gold price of $1875 an ounce in the third quarter of 2013 and an average price of $2000 in the fourth quarter. However, in Deutsche Bank's quarterly commodities report published last Tuesday ñ right before the start of a massive sell-off in the metals complex that is still underway today ñ Brebner and his team slashed their Q3 target 13.3 percent (to $1625) and their Q4 target 15 percent (to $1700). They also introduced a new trade recommendation:†long palladium, short gold. Deutsche Bank Below is their explanation of the trade: Although there are short term risks to the palladium outlook given the degree of speculative length, over the coming years we look for palladium to out-perform gold. This not only reflects rising markets deficits in palladium, but the implications of a new long term uptrend in the U.S. dollar poses for the gold price. Tightening physical fundamentals in the palladium market are being driven by both supply and demand side factors. On the supply side, we see the risk of additional supply disappointment as an ongoing feature in this market. On the demand side, we expect slightly lower diesel penetration in Europe and by inference more palladium gasoline catalysts will help to boost the demand side of the palladium market balance. Finally, the upturn in U.S. economic activity is leading our U.S. Auto team to upgrade their forecasts for U.S. car sales this year and next. Moreover, Chinese auto sales continue to grow strongly and government efforts to reduce emission levels would also tend to support palladium demand over the medium term. Today, in a follow-up note, the team introduces another, similar trade:†long aluminum, short gold. Deutsche Bank In this morning's note, titled "Metals Relative Value: Long Aluminium vs Short Gold," they write: On a valuation basis gold still trades rich relatively to the industrial metals complex ... Moreover in an environment of a rising US dollar and the possibility of an upturn in Chinese economic activity before the end of this year, it might be safe to assume that the undervaluation of industrial metals relative to gold may start to normalise. Indeed the aggressive short positions held by the speculative community in base metals would suggest that in the event of a short term improvement in real economy data in China, these positions may be closed. Moreover we would view these base vs gold RV trades as potentially profitable over a multi year horizon since they tend to perform well in strong dollar environment, Figure 2. It looks the gold sell-off over the past week or so has made believers of most Wall Street strategists for now.
Homebuilder confidence missed expectations this morning. What's really interesting is why: "Many builders are expressing frustration over being unable to respond to the rising demand for new homes due to difficulties in obtaining construction credit, overly restrictive mortgage lending rules and construction costs that are increasing at a faster pace than appraised values," said Rick Judson, NAHB Chairman in a press release.  There's a myth out there that the Fed is engaging in crazy-loose monetary policy and inflating bubbles. But when you have homebuilders saying that there's significant demand for new homes, but that the credit isn't there to satisfy that demand, then you know that credit is not that loose. Why do people assume that money is loose? Because they believe that low interest rates are evidence of loose policy. But actually that's not the case. The easiest way to prove that is to just look at a long-term chart of 10-year yields. FRED Back in the late 70s, and very early 80s, interest rates were well into the double digits. Do people associate this time with very hard, tight policy? Of course not! The period of rising rates are associated with a Fed that was too loose, and had lost control of inflation. Now we see the inverse, where interest rates have been declining, due to lack of inflation, growth, and a belief that the Fed will respond aggressively to beat back inflation. The market is saying that the Fed is still to tight (no inflation being generated in the economy, no growth) and the homebuilders are confirming that view.
PIMCO's Bill Gross is bullish on gold.¬† And even as the yellow metal collapses into a bear market, Gross is reiterating a call he made at the Barron's Roundtable in January. In case you missed it, here's an excerpt from Barron's: ...The real risk to the financial markets is the marginal proclivity of investors to put their money in real assets, or under the mattress. Thus, my first recommendation is GLD -- the  SPDR Gold Trust exchange-traded fund. It has a fee, but it is an easy way for investors to buy a real asset. Lots of things go into pricing gold, but real interest rates [adjusted for inflation] and expected inflation are two dominant considerations. Gold probably won't move much from current levels unless real rates decline more or inflationary expectations rise from the current 2.5% to 3%, or higher. That's what gets gold off the dime. It is a decent hedge. It doesn't earn anything, but not much else earns anything either. Minutes ago, he just tweeted: Gross: OK, so I made a bad call at the Barron‚Äôs Roundtable. I would still buy gold here. World reflating.
The S&amp;P 500 closed at an all-time high on Thursday.¬† And this rally has largely caught off guard Morgan Stanley's Adam Parker, who raised his year-end price target on the S&amp;P ot 1,600 just a month ago. "The truth is that we are starting to think our year-end target is too low ‚Äì already," says Parker in his note today. In a note titled "Five Things We've Been Thinking," Parker says that the market kind of reminds him of basketball star Kobe Bryant, who went down on Friday night with a potentially career-ending injury. Here's Parker: 3) Mamba: Kobe Bryant, the famous basketball player, is scoring the most points and playing the most minutes for anyone his age in the history of the NBA this season, until his injury last week. He is known for his relentlessness. It got us thinking this weekend that the magnitude and duration of the recent market rally are kind of Mamba-esque. Through the end of March, the market is up nine of the last ten months, and by 17.4% over that time frame (not counting another 1.25% month-to-date in April). This is the 34th time in the past 50 years that the market has rallied for 9 out of 10 months, and only one of those rallies went 10 for 10. There have been 139 out of the 582 10-month periods where the market rally was larger, meaning that while this has been a big rally, it has been marked more by its steadiness and relentlessness than its sheer magnitude. As our work has shown for some time, the week-over-week changes in the Fed balance sheet and the S&amp;P500 are highly entrained, and we think that this is certainly responsible for the durability and consistency of the market rally over the last ten months. Interestingly, Parker only seems to focus on the good things like Bryant's "relentlessness," and not his sudden injury. Perhaps he's hoping to use that analogy later.
Reuters/Mike BlakeThe NAHB housing market index for April fell to 42. This is down from 44 in March. Homebuilder confidence also missed expectations for a rise to 45. Click here to refresh &gt; But the component gauging sales expectations in the next six months climbed three points to 53, the highest level since February 2007. "Many builders are expressing frustration over being unable to respond to the rising demand for new homes due to difficulties in obtaining construction credit, overly restrictive mortgage lending rules and construction costs that are increasing at a faster pace than appraised values," said Rick Judson, NAHB Chairman in a press release.  "While sales conditions are generally improving, these challenges are holding back new building and job creation." Paul Diggle at Capital Economics has previously warned that capacity constraints among mortgage lenders is one of the crucial bottlenecks to the housing recovery. The National Association of Home Builders' housing market index is a sentiment index in which respondents rate not just the housing market but also the economy in general. The index draws on builder perceptions of current single-family home sales and sales expectations for the next six months. It also includes builders' expectations of traffic of prospective buyers. A reading of 50 shows that an equal number of builders view the market as good or bad.
FINRA, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, has charged¬†"Wall Street 2" actor Anastasios¬†"Tommy" Belesis¬†and his brokerage firm¬†John Thomas Financial with fraud.¬† Just last month, the¬†Securities and Exchange Commission sued Belesis¬†and a Houston radio host for allegedly defrauding investors. It was a different case, though. Here's the full release from FINRA:¬†(emphasis ours) Washington, D.C. ‚Äî The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) announced today that it has filed a complaint against John Thomas Financial (JTF), of New York, NY, and its Chief Executive Officer, Anastasios "Tommy" Belesis, charging fraud in connection with the sale of America West Resources, Inc. (AWSR) common stock, intimidation of registered representatives, trading ahead, failing to provide best execution for customer orders and various other violations. The complaint also names Michele Misiti, Branch Office Manager; John Ward, trader; Joseph Castellano, Chief Compliance Officer; and Ronald Vincent Cantalupo, Regional Managing Director. JTF and many of its customers owned AWSR stock as a result of participation in the company's private financings. According to the complaint, on Feb. 23, 2012, the price of AWSR common stock, which at the time was thinly traded on the OTC Bulletin Board, spiked higher, by over approximately 600 percent, opening at 28 cents per share, peaking at $1.80 per share and eventually closing the day at $1.29 per share. On the same day, JTF sold 855,000 shares, the majority of its proprietary position in AWSR, reaping proceeds of more than $1 million. The complaint alleges that while JTF sold its shares at the height of the price spike, the firm received at least 15 customer orders to sell more than one million shares, yet only entered one of these orders for execution on Feb. 23, 2012. Instead, JTF and Belesis prevented the orders from being executed on the same day they were received and¬†some customer orders were executed the following day or days after at prices grossly inferior to those obtained by the firm while other customer orders were not entered or executed at all. AWSR is now in bankruptcy and the customers' investments are virtually worthless. In addition, the complaint alleges that JTF and Belesis, through Misiti and Castellano, lied to the firm's registered representatives and customers about the reasons the customer shares could not be sold on Feb. 23, 2012, including that there was a problem with the clearing firm's trading systems, there was insufficient volume on that day to fill the orders, and the shares could not be sold because they were restricted under the Securities Act of 1933. FINRA further alleges that to conceal that the firm received the orders during the February 23 price spike but failed to execute them, JTF and Belesis, through Misiti, "lost" order tickets for customer orders received on Feb. 23, 2012, and replaced six of those tickets with falsified tickets dated Feb. 24, 2012. Belesis and Misiti also made misrepresentations to FINRA concerning Belesis' role in the misconduct. Also, the complaint charges JTF, Belesis, Castellano and Cantalupo with violating FINRA's anti-intimidation rule by physically threatening (including threatening to have them "run over"), harassing and assaulting registered representatives who have disagreed with Belesis' business practices, and threatening to ruin the registered representatives' financial careers by improperly marking their industry records. You probably recognize Belesis, the CEO of John Thomas, as the managing director to Shia¬†LeBouf's character¬†in¬†Oliver Stone's "Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps." He also¬†organized a rally to¬†"put the pride back in Wall Street"¬†a couple of years ago.¬†
underconsideration.com/hudsonandbroad.comShortly after announcing that it†hired advisors to raise $1 billion to bolster its shrinking cash reserves, JC Penney announced that it drew $875 million from its $1.85 billion credit line.† Brian Sozzi, CEO and Chief Equities Strategist at Belus Capital, says that the size of the withdrawal is alarming. "The number signals that right this very second, the cash burn rate is alarmingly high after a disappointing first quarter and continued store level modernization efforts," Sozzi says. Using the credit line shows that they couldn't wait to raise new capital through investors, which Sozzi†predicted would be necessary†in February. On the other hand it may be alarming that Penney couldn't withdraw more money. Writes Zerohedge: More worrisome is the fact that the firm managed to extract only $850 million on $2.3 billion in Inventory: while not completely worthless as we first suspected, it appears JPM is only willing to give JCP credit for about a third of its inventory at liquidation value. Remember that the revolver it is the cheapest financing JCP has in place which raises the question - why not draw more?††Ask JPM. The company's credit line is†an "asset based loan"†secured by inventory and accounts receivable. It increased the maximum amount of the loan earlier this year, but hadn't drawn upon it until now. It comes from a number of banks including units of JP Morgan and Bank of America.† The company can draw on the line of credit at any time, and only pays interest on the amount that it has withdrawn.† CEO Ron Johnson stepped down last week after losing support for a radical turnaround strategy included building boutique-style shop-in-shops in stores and getting rid of promotions. The company plans to use the money to fund its operations, capital spending, and to buy inventory as it completes renovations on its stores.† The press release seems to confirm that new CEO Mike Ullman isn't scrapping Ron Johnson's changes to the company's stores.† From the release:† As†we near completion of the home department transformation in over 500 stores, we have been undertaking and will continue to experience a significant inventory build and increase in capital expenditures. Even partial execution of Johnson's strategy is going to require significant cash, so this is just the first step in a longer saga.† JCPenney shares are down nearly 0.7% after trading up 3.5% in pre-market trading before the news.
Flickr/suuswansinkYou prepare your own taxes?!? Are you insane? I ran into a friend at the local coffee place recently. She made the mistake of mentioning that her husband prepares their household taxes, by himself. ìWhat?† Is he insane?î ìI know, seriously, I keep telling him not to.î Dear friend, donít do this to yourself. I would no more do my own personal taxes than I would hand-sew my wifeís wedding dress, do her hair and makeup just before the ceremony, and then administer the vows for the both of us.† Because I might, just might, make a mistake along the way. I would rather rebuild the household toilet, sewage and drainage system and connect it to the city system, while everyone was living there, than do my own personal taxes.† I mean, what could go wrong? I would no more prepare the infamous fugu sashimi for my friends and relatives than attempt my own taxes. † Who writes the tax code? The income tax code consists of hundreds of specialty provisions written by and for relatively narrow interests who know how to maximize their advantages.[1]† Trying to navigate this even half-way intelligently makes no sense for a non-specialist.[2] Now, Iím no Steve Forbes[3], but I too long for the day when taxes are so simple we can all prepare them ourselves, for free, in a couple of minutes. I donít expect comprehensive overhaul of the tax code, however, will be Obamaís legacy ñ it doesnít seem his style, and heís got nobody on the other side of the aisle who would risk giving him that legacy opportunity ñ but, boy do we need it. Until that tax simplification and overhaul however, Iím not doing my own taxes. † Is there any time its ok to do your own taxes? My personal finance students wanted to know this.† Yes, if you are a student with, say, less than $5,000 in income, Iíll endorse your do-it-yourself approach.† But if youíre a working adult with a regular salary, you canít afford the risk of doing this yourself. † What about using tax-preparation software? Stop.† Just hire someone. † What about using one of those pop-up stores like H&amp;R Block or Jackson Hewitt? Well, now youíve upgraded the DIY approach to working with someone who received 1 weeksí worth of training, and used the same tax-preparation software you could have bought off the shelf. Also, their business model has always been about short-term and sub-prime lending, making tax-refund anticipation loans.† I mean, what could possibly go wrong? † But isnít it costly to hire a tax preparer? No, wrong question. Right question: Isnít it costly not to hire a tax preparer?† †Answer: yes. First, thereís the high probability you will pay too much in taxes.† In one year, many taxpayers will save more than the cost charged by their tax preparer.† Over many years, I suspect, the advice of a professional will save you from paying many times their professional cost, in taxes.

Happy tax week, everyone. † [1] Who are the narrow-interest people who write the tax code?† As Lawrence Lessig brilliantly points out in this must-watch Ted talk, just 0.05% of people matter when it comes to selecting people who run for Congress.† Thereís a high correlation between those 0.05% and people who can privately benefit from narrow provisions in a tax code.

Instagram/jwheymanThe New York Fed's April Empire State Manufacturing Survey is out. The headline index fell to 3.05, below expectations for a 7.00 reading and last month's 9.24 reading. Below is a summary of the report, from the release: The April 2013 Empire State Manufacturing Survey indicates that conditions for New York manufacturers improved slightly. The general business conditions index fell six points but, at 3.1, remained positive for a third consecutive month. Similarly, the new orders index was lower than last month but still positive,¬†dipping six points to 2.2, and the shipments index fell to 0.8. The indexes for both prices paid and prices received inched higher‚Äîa sign that the pace of input and selling price increases had picked up over the month. Employment indexes climbed, showing a modest increase in both employment levels and hours worked. Indexes for the six-month outlook pointed to a moderate degree of optimism about future conditions. In a series of supplementary questions‚Äîpreviously posed in surveys conducted in April 2012 and earlier‚Äîrespondents were asked how much difficulty they had experienced finding workers proficient in mathematical, computer, interpersonal, and other workplace skills. As in the earlier surveys, the most widespread difficulties related to the search for workers with advanced computer skills. In addition, a skill set that has reportedly grown harder to find is punctuality and reliability. Responses to other supplemental questions indicated that firms expected wages to rise by roughly 2¬Ω percent, on average, over the next twelve months, and that, for nearly a third of firms, retaining skilled workers would become increasingly difficult in the year ahead.

" Last week, JP Morgan and Wells Fargo both announced better-than-expected earnings.¬† But signs of slowing loan growth had some worried about the near-term outlook for the industry as well as the economy in general. "Global Consumer Bank revenues of $10.0 billion were flat versus the prior year period, as volume growth in most businesses was offset by the continuing impact of spread compression globally and consumer deleveraging in North America," said management. Here's more on North American consumer banking: North America GCB revenues declined 1% to $5.1 billion driven mainly by lower retail banking revenues with total cards revenues (Citi-branded cards and Citi retail services) flat versus the prior year period. Retail banking revenues declined 3% to $1.6 billion from the first quarter 2012, primarily reflecting the ongoing impact of spread compression, partially offset by higher volumes. Mortgage banking volumes remained strong, although margins declined versus the prior year period. Citi-branded cards revenues declined 1% to $2.0 billion, reflecting lower average loan balances as Citi-branded cards loans declined 5% partially offset by an improvement in net interest spreads. Citi retail services revenues increased 1% to $1.5 billion driven by improved net interest spreads that were partially offset by a 2% decline in average loans versus the prior year period. Citi retail services revenues were also negatively impacted by higher contractual partner payments due to the impact of improving credit trends.
Laenulfean / FlickrIn recent years, we've seen the economy slow and the stock market turn during the spring. Economic reports are piling up to suggest the U.S. economy is heading for yet another spring slowdown. This week will be loaded with more economic reports and a wave of earnings announcements.¬† Companies like General Electric, Bank of America, McDonald's, Google, and Johnson &amp; Johnson will publish their quarterly financial results. Everyone will be watching carefully for clues suggesting the spring slowdown is really happening.¬† If it is happening, then we may have already seen the top form for the stock market. Top Stories Economic Calendar Market Update The stock market closed at an all-time high on Thursday before selling off on Friday.¬† And everyone wants to know if we've seen the top for the market. For now, market valuations continue to appear cheap largely due to expectations for healthy earnings growth. "The forward 12-month P/E ratio for the index current stands at 13.9, which is slightly below the 10-year average of 14.2," notes FactSet's John Butters.¬† "With such high earnings expectations for the remainder of 2013, the market will be keenly focused during this earnings season on guidance and other comments from S&amp;P 500 corporations pertaining to earnings projections for the rest of the year." Watch below Joe Greco, managing director of Trading &amp; Sales at Meridian Equity Partners, give an overview of the key events to influence the markets this week.
Reuters/Mario AnzuoniGood morning. Here's what you need to know.
Bloomberg via YouTubeThe quote of the day belongs to the always enthusiastic newsletter writer Dennis Gartman. In the latest Gartman Letter he writes: "We've traded gold for nearly four decades and we've never‚Ä¶ ever‚Ä¶ ever‚Ä¶ seen anything like what we've witnessed in the past two trading sessions. Spot gold as we write is trading $1450/ounce in dollar terms and that is a rally, hard thought that might seem to believe." On Friday, Gartman wrote that he was long of gold in Yen terms and that the "technical prospects for gold/U.S. dollars appears week." At the time he wrote if gold got to $1,555 it could unleash a "torrent of selling." Today he follows up on that: "Never, however, did we think that gold would plunge by $100+/ounce, and certainly we did not believe that gold would fall by $150/ounce as it has thus far. We thought perhaps that gold might fall $25/ounce‚Ä¶ perhaps $35/ounce... but never would we have imagined it selling down by this sum. "The pressure now upon the likes of Mr. Paulson and others who are hugely net long of gold in various manners must be intense indeed. Their margin clerks cannot be amused and must indeed be wholly and utterly dismayed.¬†¬†¬† "We fear that when NY opens hours from now, and when the public sees the damage done to their accounts, there will be one more violent sum of selling that hopefully shall clear the decks.¬† However, we cannot be certain that that is true and the ‚Äútrue believers‚Äù in gold are clearly under duress." Many have said Cyprus is behind the rout in gold. In fact on Friday, the governor of the Central Bank of Cyprus said the government seemed committed to selling state gold without consulting with the central bank. From Gartman: "We shall stand by our comments of late last week that if the Bank of Cyprus and/or the Treasury there is being forced to sell gold, then the other countries in trouble shall be forced to do the same. If Cyprus is forced to sell gold, then Portugal shall be too, otherwise the discrimination against Cyprus shall be wholly unwarranted and utterly unfair. And if Portugal is forced to sell, then how can Italy avoid the same fate... or Greece for that matter."
Gold got crushed on Friday, and the sell-off is even worse today. Right now, the metal is down nearly 7%, trading near $1399 an ounce. Earlier this morning, it touched a low of $1385. Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale analyst Stephanie Aymes says next stop is $1265, and we should expect it in 1-3 months. Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale
The super cycle in commodities has come to an end, according to researchers at Citi, who downgraded several mining stocks on Monday as metals prices have continued to decline since the start of the year. Gold¬†hit an intraday low of $1,427.14 an ounce on Monday, its lowest since April 2011, before regaining ground. This follows a decline of 5 percent on Friday, its biggest one-day slide since 2008. The precious metal has slipped around 14 percent so far this year, after a 400 percent mega-rally over the last 12 years. Silver,¬†platinum¬†and¬†palladium¬†have also been hit by heavy selling and¬†copper's gains in recent weeks have been wiped out in the face of weak Chinese data. Oil has also hit multi-month lows with futures falling more than $2 on Monday. "Citi expects 2013 to be the year in which the death knolls ring for the commodity super cycle, ushering in a new decade of opportunities based on how individual commodities will perform against one another and against broader market indicators such as equities or currencies," research analysts said in a note on Monday. (Read More:¬†Has China's Economy Hit a 'Dead End'?) "The forecast prices of key base metals of aluminum, copper and nickel have been cut between 5-10 percent for 2013 and between 8-13 percent for 2014. The gold price has seen the biggest change with a cut of around circa 13 percent for the next three years." China's disappointing gross domestic product (GDP) data¬†released on Monday led to concerns about the outlook for the world's second largest economy and weighed significantly on mining stocks. China's economy grew an annual 7.7 percent in the first quarter, below the expected 8 percent level and down from 7.9 percent in the previous quarter. A report from the¬†Financial Times¬†showed that the world's top commodities traders have pocketed nearly $250 billion over the last decade, riding a commodities super cycle caused by the industrialization of China and other emerging countries. These boom years for China have now been superseded by uncertainty, according to Citi. (Read More:¬†US, China Data Set Negative Tone for Oil Prices) "Chinese overcapacity remains an issue, as the investment-led boom over the past few years increased plant capacity," it said. "A tighter financing environment awaits local governments due to the need to contain the expansion of local government debt and reorient the economic model." Steel, cement, petrochemical, non-ferrous metals and thermal coal power could all be affected due to this belt tightening, according to Citi, which slashed price targets for a number of U.K. blue-chip mining stocks on Monday, keeping¬†Rio Tinto¬†as the only "buy". Randgold Resources,¬†Lonmin, Rio Tinto,¬†Fresnillo¬†and¬†Kazakmys¬†all posted heavy declines on Monday morning in London trading.

When we get down towards the more, dare I say it, private sector, yes, there probably is somewhat of a concern in terms of the amount of debt that is starting to accumulate inside of China, outside of government hands," David Lennox, a mining analyst for Fat Prophets told CNBC. "The authorities will probably be able to keep any real distortion or movement from a debt point of view fairly much in control, because they have got a number of policy instruments available to them," he said, adding that debt issues are probably a perception rather than a reality at this stage. ‚ÄîBy CNBC.com's Matt Clinch; Follow him on Twitter¬†@mattclinch81

And it begins. This two-day decline in gold (which is the biggest since 2011, apparently, and which has sent the metal to below $1400/oz.) is already prompting another round of conspiracy-mongering. The action is gold/silver is another example of gov't confiscation. MFGlobal, Cyprus, Gold/Silver. This is what a currency war looks like. Interesting that #Gold crash came 4 days before hearings on #Texas depository. It's like #Bernanke sent #Perry a fish wrapped in a newspaper @fbonacci Sticking to facts: #Fed has manipulated #gold in past, has motive to do so now &amp; it's possible. That's not proof, but interesting. @12mgray @ustreasury Exactly. After yesterday I've concluded the #Fed now controls every so-called "market" in the world. Good luck to them. This is an orchestration (the smash in gold).¬† It‚Äôs been going on now from the beginning of April.¬† Brokerage houses told their individual clients the word was out that hedge funds and institutional investors were going to be dumping gold and that they should get out in advance.¬†¬† Then, a couple of days ago, Goldman Sachs announced there would be further departures from gold.¬† So what they are trying to do is scare the individual investor out of bullion.¬† Clearly there is something desperate going on.... Just thought you'd like to know how the gold bugs are taking the news.
There it is. Gold touches $1,400. Has lost $198 in April
REUTERS/Jorge Dan LopezThe big story today is a continuation of Friday's big story: A decline in things Asia-related, commodities-related, and precious metals related. Gold and silver are both getting crushed again. Silver futures are down 8%, and have fallen below $24/oz. Gold is holding just barely above $1400.oz. Chinese and Hong Kong stock markets both fell over 1%, after a slew of Chinese data (including GDP) came in weak. That slammed the Aussie dollar, which is sensitive to Chinese data. That also caused more weakness in the big industrial commodities, like copper and oil, the latter of which is now below $90/barrel. Europe is lower, as are US futures.
REUTERS/Kim Kyung-HoonLast night, China reported several economic datapoints that were weak, including GDP. Today: Shops will take down their Chinese GDP forecasts. Here's Zhiwei Zhang at Nomura:
The carnage won't stop for gold and silver! After getting slammed Friday, and last night, the precious metals just took another leg down. Gold has fallen to $1401/oz. Silver is now below $24/oz. Via Kitco: kitco Kitco
As commodities continue their meltdown this morning, Jim Cramer puts things into the big picture for investors: Basically, the Chinese marginal buyer is done for (helped by the fact that growth is weakening) and prices have to go lower. They've just crushed the commodities. An overall give-up related to a belief that China is THE marginal buyer of everything.... It looks like these are financial buyers who are being margined out. Fascinating to watch: oil falling because if the Chinese stop buying, and we are glutted it has to come down..
We're not sure if this has anything to do with the plummeting price of gold, but it's interesting that Kitco.com is down. Kitco is one of the biggest gold sites in the world, and it's where tons of people go to first to get a real-time quote on precious metals. It's especially popular in Canada, but not simply there. We have no idea if the site is down by fluke, or related to the numerous gold watchers, eagerly refreshing every second to see the carnage. Kitco (Via @sunnyag)
Quick note, earlier we mentioned that there was a selloff in Asia and anything related to commodities. Now Europe is feeling the heat too. European markets have gone into the red. Italy is down 0.9%. FTSE MIB
One of the things I really hate about the current Wall Street environment is how so many people have been fooled into thinking that commodities are a necessary part of your asset allocation. †Iíve been pretty hard on commodities over the years (see this detailed piece here). †I think itís mostly just a ruse to sell another group of products and I think itís really dangerous. †But even worse, I just think betting on commodities is fundamentally flawed thinking. †Not only are you speculating in a zero sum game involving production-less input costs, but youíre directly betting against human ingenuity. †I donít like either of those bets. If one actually takes a look at the long-term real returns of commodities you realize theyíre actually quite dreadful. †Even if we cherry pick a decent period that includes a big boom like the last 20 years we still see pretty awful performance. †Over the last 20 years commodities have returned just 1.6% per year over the last 20 years †(see figure 1). †Thatís a real return of about MINUS 1%. I prefer to think of commodities as something that are an input or a means to helping us innovate. †If youíre bullish on oil price dynamics you shouldnít go buy barrels of oil and store them in a locker somewhere. †You should find the companies who leverage the use of that commodity and will benefit by innovating through the use of that input. †Donít bet against innovation. †Bet on it. I say all of this as I see the silver bubble (that I discussed back in 2011 when silver was 40% higher) come crashing down. † Sensible portfolio construction starts with understanding the role of specific assets in the economy and how those various assets fit into your portfolio in particular ways. †I donít know why this theme of commodities as an asset class has taken off over the last 10 years, but it sure doesnít seem to be helping anybody except those selling the ideaÖ.

China just released its latest batch of economic data which showed that economic growth missed analyst expectations. First here's a look at the latest data from China, including trade and inflation data that were released last week: Business Insider "The fall in 1Q13 GDP growth was mainly driven by a slowdown in consumption growth due to the new leadersí crackdown on govt luxury spending, a pause in inventory restocking and slowdown in property FAI growth due to concerns on property tightening," said Bank of America's Ting Lu in a note to clients. There has already been a jump in lending in March. And some economists have warned that this could be the end of easy credit in China as this surge in lending poses risks to the financial system. But China has set a GDP target of 7.5 percent for the year. And some economists like Lu expect monetary policy to stay neutral (on account of cooling inflation) and GDP growth to climb back to 8 percent in the second quarter, if the bird flu is kept in check.
