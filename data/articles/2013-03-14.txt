Whenever the vast majority of investors, pundits and the media agree on the direction of the market, they are usually wrong.Â  In the past few days as the indexes have either broken or approached new highs, an apparent wave of euphoria has been evident.Â  The â€œexpertsâ€ cite the gains so far in 2013, the Fedâ€™s willingness to keep its foot on the gas for however long it takes, a perception of improvement in the economy, rosy earnings forecasts and reasonable stock valuations.Â  The still significant major problems facing the market are now being mostly ignored. The marketâ€™s positive beginning to the year is far from unique, and is not much different than the start of each of the last three years.Â  2010 began with a gain in the S&amp;P 500 of 9.2% only to be followed by a 15.6% correction.Â  Similarly, the next year started with an increase of 8.4% and then corrected by 19.4%.Â  Early last year the market gained 13.1% before dropping 10.5%.Â  So far this year the market has jumped 9.6%, similar to the gains of the prior three years.Â  With investor sentiment extremely high and serious domestic and foreignÂ  problems still unresolved, we think that not only are the chances for a major correction quite high, but that the entire market rise since March 2009 may be coming to an end.Â  Economic growth has been staggering along at barely a 2% annual growth rate, and recent economic numbers give us little reason to believe that the pace is increasing. Although February retail sales jumped 1.1% from a month earlier, the number appeared at odds with the non-seasonally-adjusted figure, which was down 0.4%. This was the first time in three years that unadjusted February retail sales were below a month earlier.Â  In 2012, unadjusted sales were up 4.5%, yet resulted in a seasonally-adjusted number of plus 0.7%.Â  Over the last seven years on average, unadjusted February retail sales were 1.8% below January.Â  This translated into minus 1.2% seasonally adjusted.Â  We will therefore have to wait and see whether retail sales really rebounded strongly last month or whether it was a statistical quirk as we suspect.Â  Consumers are still burdened with excessive debt and barely increasing wages, while the savings rate in January was already back down to 2.4%. In addition, the economic numbers available to date do not yet reflect the tightening fiscal policy resulting from the agreement to avert the fiscal cliff and the failure to stop the sequester from going into effect.Â  The sequester will continue to slowly affect the economy with the passage of time as various aspects of the program are put into place.Â  It is estimated that the sequester canÂ result in theÂ loss of anywhere from 500,000 to 700,000 jobs.Â  In the event that the sequester is cancelled by a so-called â€œgrand bargainâ€ (which looks less and less likely), the result will be a combination of spending cuts and tax increases that would similarly reduce economic growth. Â  It is also noteworthy that none of the above reflects the recession in much of Europe, the uncertainty created by the recent Italian elections, the probable re-emergence of European financial instability, Chinaâ€™s problems with both inflation and slowing growth, the Japanese recession and serious economic problems in the other BRIC nations.Â  The real potential of geopolitical turmoil (Syria, Egypt, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Mali) is also being ignored. It seems to us that the failure of the last dip in the market to accelerate on the downside has drawn in the last of those looking to put money in the market and that the prevalent view is that the market has nowhere to go but up.Â  Sentiment is at historically high levels while the number of daily new highs has been dropping during the advance.Â  Insider transactions are heavily on the sell side and volume has been drying up.Â  In addition we doubt that retail investors will come to the rescue.Â  Theyâ€™ve been badly burned twice in the last 13 years and have no stomach to do it again.Â  It will take the rise of a new generation before retail investors become comfortable with the market again. In our view there is a strong possibility that the S&amp;P 500 makes an approximate triple top with the intraday highs of 1576 in October 2007 and 1553 in March 2000Â with a major cyclical downturn to follow.
Agence France PresseHaruhiko KurodaJapan's parliament on Friday approved a new central bank management team that is widely expected to support the government's demands for more action to stoke the world's third-biggest economy. The upper house gave the green light to Haruhiko Kuroda as Bank of Japan governor, with the finance veteran and long-time BoJ critic seen as likely to launch aggressive monetary easing measures, after his predecessor drew heavy criticism for failing to turn around Japan's fortunes. Lawmakers also approved the nominations of Kikuo Iwata and Hiroshi Nakaso as Kuroda's deputies, with all three clearing the vote hurdle with comfortable margins. Japan's leading opposition party had warned it would vote against Iwata -- a strong supporter of monetary easing and of giving Tokyo more control over the independent BoJ -- but his nomination passed by a count of 124 votes in favour with 96 votes against. The BoJ's new management team, which was approved by the lower house on Thursday, is expected to take up their positions next week. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe nominated the 68-year-old Kuroda, viewing him as a kindred spirit likely to back the premier's prescription of big spending and aggressive monetary easing to drag Japan out of years of deflation that has crimped private spending and corporate investment. During parliamentary confirmation hearings, Kuroda vowed that he would do "everything possible" to reverse years of falling prices, while criticising previous BoJ administrations for failing to fix the problem. "High hopes are resting on the ability of the Bank of Japan's new leadership to revitalise the economy," said London-based Capital Economics in a note. The yen was little moved by the vote, but the currency has been under pressure for months on easing speculation after Abe's administration swept to power in landslide December elections, pledging to fix the economy and install like-minded leadership at the Bank of Japan. Kuroda, who has announced his resignation as head of the Manila-based Asian Development Bank, may have limited options, however, after the BoJ in January announced the launch of an unlimited easing programme and the adoption of a two-percent inflation target aimed at beating deflation. The asset purchase policy is similar to the US Federal Reserve's unlimited monthly bond-buying scheme, known as quantitative easing. Kuroda's proposal to buy longer-maturity assets and bring the unlimited asset-purchase plan forward underwhelmed markets. Analysts are now looking to the new BoJ team's first policy meeting next month. The outspoken Abe clashed with Shirakawa on policy matters, previously warning that he might change a law guaranteeing the bank's independence if it did not follow his policies, stirring protests from central bankers abroad.

Bloomberg TelevisionU.S. economic data has been coming in strong. Employment is improving, manufacturing is increasing, and housing continues its rebound. The economic highlight of this week was Wednesday's February retail sales report, that broadly crushed expectations. But bearish economist David Rosenberg didn't see it quite that way. While he acknowledges that the payroll tax hike and jump in gas prices haven't been able to hold down the consumer, he does note one worrisome nugget in the report. From today's "Breakfast With Dave" note: While receipts at the grocery chains were up sharply, restaurants posted a 0.7 percent decline and this followed on the heels of a 0.6 percent drop in January (in a sign that there is still frugality beneath the veneer, the data showed that 'eating in is in while eating out is out'). Note that this the sharpest two-month decline since January-February of 2008, just as the recession was getting rolling. Only once in the 2002-2007 economic expansion did we see such a back-to-back decline, and only three times in the 1993-2000 up-cycle, and not once (!) in the super-long 1982-1990 growth era — so these are very rare outside of recessions. In fact, we also had a similar two-month decline in November-December of 2000 and the very next quarter, guess what? The prior recession to the one we recently began! As our PM Reno has pointed out time and again, this segment is leading indicator for consumer discretionary spending. The chart below shows the sequential restaurant sales in bars and the thin line illustrates the declining YoY trend. Gluskin Sheff Rosenberg isn't saying that this screams recession.  However, he believes that the retail sales report's "sector composition was really strange." In other words, he's not ready to get giddy about the U.S. recovery.
Housing analysts have been turning extremely bullish and a few expect home prices to rise 8 percent this year.Â  Paul Diggle at Capital Economics is one of them. But the housing recovery still has some hurdles it needs to clear.Â  "Capacity constraints in lendersâ€™ mortgage departments are one of the few remaining bottlenecks in the housing recovery and one of the factors contributing to the marginal role being played by mortgage- dependent buyers," he writes.Â  While some people focus on the slow rise in residential construction employment, Diggle pays more attention to the slow pace of job growth in the real estate credit sector.Â  Between 2005 - 2009, employment in the real estate credit sector fell by 45 percent, while mortgage applications fell 75 percent. Since then however, mortgage applications have "almost doubled", according to Diggle, while job growth in the real estate credit sector has only increased by seven percent. Admittedly real estate credit workers tend to have a smaller role in the economy than home construction workers, but this is key to the capacity constraints among mortgage lenders, which in turn is impacting the housing recovery. The number of mortgage applications being processed by each employee is close to a record high. And the time taken to process a loan is also at "historically high" levels. "Lendersâ€™ need to manage the level of mortgage applications given their constrained processing capacity is one explanation for why mortgage rates are at record highs relative to MBS yields and credit scoring criteria are very strict. All of this has helped contribute to the marginal role being played by mortgage-dependent buyers in the housing recovery. "Either way, the bottom line is that an easing in capacity constraints is a necessary precondition to mortgage buyers playing a fuller role in the housing recovery." Capital Economics

Youtube screencapA trove of trader instant messages (IMs) and conversations from JP Morgan's CIO office are being made public. This afternoon, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations released a massive 300-page report slamming JPMorgan claiming the bank mislead investors and regulators over the "London Whale" trade.  The subcommittee's ranking Republican, Senator John McCain, told reporters that JPMorgan "dodged federal regulators and misled the public by hiding losses, by mismarking credit derivatives’ values," according to Bloomberg News. The Senate report cites instant messages and phone transcripts between traders providing a glimpse of what was happening on the inside at the bank. Here's an exchange between Bruno Iksil (the actual "London Whale"/the head trader in charge of the Synthetic Credit Portfolio), Javier Martin-Artajo (the head of Credit and Equity Trading who oversaw the SCP) and junior trader Julien Grout who was in charge of marking the portfolio's positions each day. Note that this conversation took place in March of 2012.  The "London Whale" wasn't revealed in the media until April. From the Senate report (emphasis ours):  (4) Trading Stopped  On Friday, March 23, 2012, Ina Drew ordered Mr. Martin and Mr. Iksil to “put phones down” and stop trading credit derivatives related to the SCP book. The halt in trading did not, however, produce a halt in the mismarking.  The SCP book, which was essentially frozen in place on March 23, continued to incur losses throughout the trading day. Mr. Iksil informed Mr. Martin-Artajo that the SCP losses that day were huge, between $300 and $600 million, depending upon whether the CIO used the midpoint or “best” prices available in the daily price range (bid-ask spread): “I reckon we have today a loss of 300M USING THE BEST BID ASKS and approximately 600m from the mids.” Using instant messaging, Mr. Iksil asked Mr. Grout to find out from Mr. Martin-Artajo what level of losses to report for the day. Mr. Iksil characterized the huge losses as “hopeless,” predicted “they are going to trash/destroy us,” and “you don’t lose 500 M[illion] without consequences,” concluding that he no longer knew what marks to use:  Mr. Iksil: “It is over/it is hopeless now. ... I tell you, they are going to trash/destroy us. ... [T]onight you’ll have at least [$]600m[illion], BID ASK, MID. BID ASK, YOU HAVE [$]300M[illion] AT LEAST... it is everywhere/all over the place. we are dead i tell you.”  [Later that day] Mr. Grout: “will you give me the color please? if there is some.”  Mr. Iksil: “nothing for now... it will be negotiated with the IB [Investment Bank] at the top and I am going to be hauled over the coals. ... you don’t lose 500M without consequences. ... ask javier what pnl [profit and loss] we print today. ... please, go see javier. i don’t know which pnl i should send.” Mr. Grout: “did you talk to javier?” [5 minutes later] Mr. Iksil: “yes. we show -3 [basis points] until month end on this one. ... all that I am asking you is to tell Javier what you see. that’s it and he decides what we show. because me, i don’t know anymore.”723 Less than an hour later, Mr. Iksil repeated many of the same complaints to a CIO colleague, stating that the crux of the problem was that the CIO had become “too big for the market.” Mr. Iksil: “[I]t had to happe[n]. [I]t started back in 2008 you see. [I] survived pretty well until [I] was alone to be the target. [Y]es [I] mean the guys know my position because [I] am too big for the market. ... [B]ut here is the loss and it becomes too large and this is it. [W]e realize that [I] am too visible.” Despite the emails predicting losses of between $300 million and $600 million, at the end of the day on March 23, 2012, the CIO reported internally a daily loss of only $12.5 million.”  The JPMorgan "London Whale" trader first surfaced in media reports in April of 2012. Both Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal reported that Iksil had a position so big it was rattling the market. Initially, CEO Jamie Dimon dismissed it as a "tempest in a teapot." Then on May 10th, JPMorgan revealed a $2 billion dollar trading loss in it's Chief Investment Office in London related to derivatives trades from the so-called "London Whale." In June, Dimon was grilled before the Senate Banking Committee and the House Financial Services Committee.  He maintained that it was an "isolated incident" and said "senior management and myself should have better monitored the CIO office."  When the bank released its Q2 earnings results on July 13th, it was revealed that the trading loss was actually $5.8 billion, more than previously thought. The bank also had to restate its Q1 net income saying it was $459 less than previously reported. There is a Senate hearing scheduled for tomorrow on the London Whale trade and it include appearances from JPMorgan's ex-CIO Ina Drew and ex-CFO Douglass Braunstein this time.
Catastrophic nuclear accidents, like Chernobyl in 1986 or Fukushima No. 1 in 2011, are, weâ€™re incessantly told, very rare, and their probability of occurring infinitesimal. But when they do occur, they get costly. So costly that the French government, when it came up with cost estimates for an accident in France, kept them secret. But now the report was leaked to the French magazine, Le Journal de Dimanche. Turns out, the upper end of the cost spectrum of an accident at the nuclear power plant at Dampierre, in the Department of Loiret in north-central France, amounted to over three times the countryâ€™s GDP. Hence, the need to keep it secret. The study was done in 2007 by the Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety (IRSN), a government agency under joint authority of the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Environment, Industry, Research, and Health.With over 1,700 employees, itâ€™s Franceâ€™s â€œpublic service expert in nuclear and radiation risks.â€ This isnâ€™t some overambitious, publicity-hungry think tank. It evaluated a range of disaster scenarios that might occur at the Dampierre plant. In the best-case scenario, costs came to â‚¬760 billionâ€”more than a third of Franceâ€™s GDP. At the other end of the spectrum: â‚¬5.8 trillion! Over three times Franceâ€™s GDP. A devastating amount. So large that France could not possibly deal with it. Yet, France gets 75% of its electricity from nuclear power. The entire nuclear sector is controlled by the state, which also owns 85% of EDF, the mega-utility that operates Franceâ€™s 58 active nuclear reactors spread over 20 plants. So, three weeks ago, the Institute released a more politically correct report for public consumption. It pegged the cost of an accident at â‚¬430 billion. â€œThere was no political smoothening, no pressure,â€ claimed IRSN Director General Jacques Repussard, but he admitted, â€œitâ€™s difficult to publish these kinds of numbers.â€ He said the original report with a price tag of â‚¬5.8 trillion was designed to counter the reports that EDF had fabricated, which â€œvery seriously underestimated the costs of the incidents.â€ Both reports were authored by IRSN economist Patrick Momal, who struggled to explain away the differences. The new number, â‚¬430 billion, was based on a â€œmedian caseâ€ of radioactive releases, as was the case in Fukushima, he told the JDD, while the calculations of 2007 were based more on what happened at Chernobyl. But then he added that even the low end of the original report, the â‚¬760 billion, when updated with the impact on tourism and exports, would jump to â‚¬1 trillion. â€œOne trillion, thatâ€™s what Fukushima will ultimately cost,â€ Repussard said. Part of the â‚¬5.8 trillion would be the â€œastronomical social costs due to the high number of victims,â€ the report stated. The region contaminated by cesium 137 would cover much of France and Switzerland, all of Belgium and the Netherlands, and a big part of Germanyâ€”an area with 90 million people (map). The costs incurred by farmers, employees, and companies, the environmental damage and healthcare expenses would amount to â‚¬4.4 trillion. â€œThose are social costs, but the victims may not necessarily be compensated,â€ the report stated ominouslyâ€”because there would be no entity in France that could disburse those kinds of amounts. Closer to the plant, 5 million people would have to be evacuated from an area of 87,000 square kilometers (about 12% of France) and resettled. The soil would have to be decontaminated, and radioactive waste would have to be treated and disposed of. Total cost: â‚¬475 billion. The weather is the big unknown. Yet itâ€™s crucial in any cost calculations. Winds blowing toward populated areas would create the worst-case scenario of â‚¬5.8 trillion. Amidst the horrible disaster of Fukushima, Japan was nevertheless lucky in one huge aspect: winds pushed 80% of the radioactive cloud out to sea. If it had swept over Tokyo, the disaster would have been unimaginable. In Chernobyl, winds made the situation worse; they spread the cloud over the Soviet Union. Yet the study might underestimate the cost for other nuclear power plants. The region around Dampierre has a lower population density than regions around other nuclear power plants. And it rarely has winds that would blow the radioactive cloud in a northerly direction toward Paris. Other nuclear power plants arenâ€™t so fortuitously located. These incidents have almost no probability of occurring, weâ€™re told. So there are currently 437 active nuclear power reactors and 144 â€œpermanent shutdown reactorsâ€ in 31 countries, according to the IAEA, for a total of 581 active and inactive reactors. Of these, four melted down so farâ€”one at Chernobyl and three at Fukushima. Hence, the probability for a meltdown is not infinitesimal. Based on six decades of history, itâ€™s 4 out of 581, or 0.7%. One out of every 145 reactors. Another 67 are under construction, and more are to come.... Decommissioning and dismantling the powerplant at Fukushima and disposing of the radioactive debris has now been estimated to take 40 years. At this point, two years after the accident, very little has been solved. But it has already cost an enormous amount of money. People who werenâ€™t even born at the time of the accident will be handed the tab for it. And the ultimate cost might never be known. The mayor of Futaba, a ghost town of once upon a time 7,000 souls near Fukushima No. 1, told his staff that evacuees might not be able to return for 30 years. Or never, for the older generation. It was the first estimate of a timeframe. But it all depends on successful decontamination. And that has turned into a vicious corruption scandal. Read....

Another remarkable development is that the S&amp;P 500, which has been very highly correlated with the price of oil and the inverse of the foreign-exchange value of the dollar, is significantly diverging from both of them. The S&amp;P 500 has been on the rise, while the price of oil has been falling and the dollar has been strengthening. This gives me more confidence in the staying power of the bull, though I can see why others might be worried that something has to give, and it might be the S&amp;P 500.

Via Yongsan IBDThe "Dream Hub" in Seoul was supposed to be a "city within a city"Â â€” home to a dozen skyscrapers, waterfront parks, and business and residential facilities. But the $28 billion project, officially called theÂ Yongsan International Business District, is on the line after developers defaulted on a major loan repayment amid a real estate slump, AFP reports. We won't know whether the project will go bankrupt until June, when another round of loans matures. While ground has been broken on the project, it's still a far way from the gleaming city pictured in the Dream Hub's promotional materials.
 joelabell via InstagramThe idea of having employees walk around with electronic sensors to track their every move is unsettling. There are privacy and legal issues, and who wants to feel like they are just a cog in a system? But data companies say that the resulting reams of information will improve life for companies and employees.  Sociometric Solutions has created tracking devices for Bank of America, Steelcase, and Cubist PharmaceuticalsÂ Inc., and is in talks with General Motors. It was started by a team of Ph.D students from MIT who decided to study the chemistry behind what makes certain workspaces like Google great at building teams. They came up with sensors placed in employee identification badges thatÂ gather real-time information to help companies measure productivity. The sensors identify a person's tone of voice, movement and even their posture when communicating with others.  "Google really cares about creating a community because theÂ social conversations â€” the ones at the water cooler, coffee maker â€” those are the ones that have the biggest impact," says Ben Waber, president of Sociometrics and one of the company's founders. "In the U.S., there's this notion that your most productive time is when you're sitting at your desk staring at the computer," and that's not necessarily true.Â   The sensors are intended to measure when and how employees are truly productive. While individual information is collected, it's anonymized to provide metadata and hedge against privacy concerns. The information is then used to suggest how employees, and the company as a whole, can work more efficiently.  "The legality behind this," says Arena, "that's the biggest unanswered question. Privacy online is sort of open and privacy issues are going to be the stumbling block for a long time. And that's a big, big question."  The tracking sensors Waber's team places electronic sensors in employees' badges, which includes a Bluetooth, a microphone (it doesn't record what people say, but rather the tone of their voice, speaking speed, and volume), a motion sensor to measure movement, and an infrared beam. Sociometric SolutionsA sociometric sensor device.The idea is that these analytic tools can help determine the nature of the conversations people are having. For example, the microphone can measure speaking tone, and the higher someone's tone or the faster they speak can indicate how excited or passionate they are at any given time. The infrared can also sense if another badge is in sight, which gives researchers an idea of how people stand when speaking to others. For example, people who usually have others facing them when speaking are more dominant personalities. On the other hand, when two people are engaged in an interesting conversation, they will likely mirror one another, which signals more equality. "Weâ€™ve been able to foretell, for example, which teams will win a business plan contest, solely on the basis of data collected from team members wearing badges at a cocktail reception,"Â Alex Pentland, a professor at MIT and also an advisor to Waber's group, wrote for the Harvard Business Review.  Since privacy is the biggest concern over the devices, after behavioral/productivity reports are sent to individuals, their identities are removed from the system so the names associated with individualÂ sensors are never revealed to employers. The testing grounds Bank of America got on board with the sensors a few years ago when it wanted to study how group dynamics impacted performance. It tested them out on 90 call center employees. Arena says that the company discovered how important it was to allow employees to take breaks together. During that time, employees would often troubleshoot their workplace problems. While sensors didn't monitor conversation, they did report "a cohesiveness was shared between the coworkers," says Arena, and the company eventuallyÂ experienced a 10 percentÂ improvement in productivity by making some workplace culture changes after the study.  Although Bank of America tested its call center employees, Arena said he thinks the data "has bigger ramifications in professional jobs than anywhere else," because you will inevitably be able to "understandÂ how one person steps into the room and influences others." "It has greater ramifications in leadership than hourly workers, but it's in the early stages."Â Arena is now theÂ head of global talent at General Motors, and told us the company is considering "doing very similar things." Steelcase, which makes office furniture,Â works with Sociometric to developÂ sensory products for its own merchandise. For example, its new chair, Gesture, is "designed toÂ support our interactions with todayâ€™s technologies" and was "inspired by the movement of the human body."Â The new chair can actually tell employers how it's being used by employees, which will give employers a better idea of what size tables and chairs to buy in order to promote better communication and, inevitably, a more productive team. "What we hoped to learn was how things influence interactions and how spaces affect those interactions,"Â Dave Lathrop,Â director of workspace futures and strategy at the company, told us. Lathrop says most of us don't know how we interact with others. For example, if you have a dominating personality, you could be "forcing people to shut down" and make them distrust you without even knowing it. "Yahoo and Best Buy are asking people to come back to the office, which does suggest that there's a general belief that when people get physically together, it's valuable," he says.Â "We're at this magical moment where we can do things that we couldn't do before ... having the analytics that we do. ... As a researcher, I'm incredibly hopeful that this will give us good data on the quality of interactions between people." But at the end of the day, employees need to feel comfortable with the idea of being tracked, even if it's anonymously â€” and that may take a while. 
BofA Merrill Lynch strategist Savita Subramanian is out with a report today titled "Is American innovation dead?" According to Subramanian, the answer is definitely "no." "We focus on China as one of the most widely cited threats to the USâ€™ global position," she writes. "Not only does the US rank significantly higher than China in the Global Innovation Index rankings, but it ranks higher in 62 of the 84 sub-components of the index, ranging from political stability to royalty and license fee receipts."

The new Joe Fresh line will put JCPenney's new boutique idea for "branded sales space" to the test, featuring a line of bright, colorful clothing, and for a steal. Everything in the collection is under $70. The designs will be featured in about 700 JCPenney retail stores across the country, and the two companies have a four-year deal. The line is bound to attract bargain-savvy consumers. But one analyst quoted in Businessweek said the Joe Fresh partnership will be the true test of whether JCPenney can work its way out of the hole its dug itself into. “If Joe Fresh doesn’t work, this could be the worst Ides of March since Brutus greeted Caesaron the floor of the Senate,” Maxim analyst Rick Snyder told Bloomberg Businessweek. "[Joe Fresh] is kind of a microcosm of what they’re trying to do, and if it doesn’t work, I think it’s going to get really ugly.”
It was an ill-fated trip to the drug store that convinced Jeff Raider that there had to be better alternatives for shaving.Â  "I was out of razor blades, so I bought a replacement and some shaving cream and ended up spending $20," said Raider, who is also a co-founder of eyewear company Warby Parker. "It wasn't the best experience in the world and the products didn't seem that great to me."Â  Raider and his friend Andy Katz-Mayfield set out to better the shaving business. The result is Harry's, a new direct-to-consumer site that sells boutique-quality razors, replacement blades, and shaving cream at affordable prices.Â  The company wisely chose an under-served market segment.Â  Until now, men mostly had to choose between razors at the drug store and high-end boutique products.Â  The Art Of Shaving sells razors for between $175 and $200.Â Harry's cheapest set includes a razor, two replacement blades, and a tube of shaving cream for $15.Â  The exception is the Dollar Shave Club, a subscription service that sends men razors and replacement blades for under $10. Unlike that business, Harry's offers redesigned razors, as well as shaving cream. The first thing the team did was improve the purchase experience. Customers can do all of their research online. Harry's also offers sets that have razors, shaving cream, and replacement blades all in one box.Â  "We were able to offer a level of convenience for our customers that they didn't necessarily have before," Katz-Mayfield told us.Â  Harry's razors also have a different design than what is widely available now.Â  The company uses blades from German producers who are located near the engineering hub of the Audi headquarters. Raider and Katz-Mayfield spent time developing the company's straight-blade product into a razor.Â  The company redesigned the razor handle to be more rounded than many of the current products on the market.

ParamountThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is taking steps that would give it power over some of the country's biggest nonbank student lenders.Â  TheseÂ are the lendersÂ who are contracted by banks and the government to manage federal and private student loans.Â  The problem is borrowers don't have a choice over which institution services their loan, and the servicer is often different than the lender itself.  Servicers collect debt payments from borrowers and distribute them to loan holders, and although the CFPB has been fielding complaints from students against these nonbank lenders, they haven't had any power over making sure they play by the same rules as traditional lenders. "The exercise of this new authority would help protect millions of student loan borrowers from potential dead ends," CFPB Director Richard Cordray said during a conference callÂ Thursday. Â "In many ways, a student loan can make or break a studentâ€™s financial lives." The public now has 60 days to give the bureau their input on the new rule. See the full proposal here.
YouTubeVincent Chaigneau"The FX markets are now under the influence of a trilogy of themes," says Société Générale strategist Vincent Chaigneau in his latest report. The three themes driving markets, Chaigneau says, constitute a "regime shift" that the bank expects to dominate the investment landscape for the rest of the year. And, in keeping with SocGen's big bet on America, the three themes all point to one thing: a stronger U.S. dollar. The first theme, according to the report, is the American economic revival. Everyone is turning bullish on the U.S. economy – especially relative to its peers in Europe and in Japan – as the labor market slowly heals and industrial production heats up. At the same time, investors are pulling money out of safe-haven assets like Treasuries and gold, causing those assets to underperform against riskier assets like stocks this year. Finally, SocGen believes the Federal Reserve will begin to taper asset purchases – i.e., start rolling back quantitative easing – in the second half of 2013. If this happens, it will be very supportive of the U.S. dollar against its competitors in the developed world. "The exit debate, we reckon, will heat up in H2," Chaigneau writes, "and this will propel the US dollar higher: we see the EUR/USD down to 1.20 by year-end, and the USD/JPY above 103." That parlays nicely into the second theme: diverging expectations of policy moves from global central banks. While the Federal Reserve begins to draw up an easy-money exit plan, other central banks around the world appear to be just getting started. Take the Bank of Japan, for example, which is about to roll out the government's "Abenomics" game plan when it installs a big dove at the head of the central bank next month. Britain is doing the same at the Bank of England. Incoming BoE Governor Mark Carney takes the helm in July, and the British government is discussing modifying the central bank's remit to allow Carney to get more experimental with monetary easing. "Monetary policy expectations will remain a drag this year for the currencies of countries that are lagging in the recovery, mostly European currencies and the yen," writes Chaigneau. The European Central Bank is a bit more of an open question, but one thing is for sure – the euro area continues to sink deeper into recession, and ECB President Mario Draghi took great care to emphasize at the central bank's most recent press conference that the ECB's monetary stance remains accommodative. That brings us to the third theme. While the euro crisis has faded as a major driver of global markets in recent months, SocGen expects "another shockwave" in the euro zone "in the spring." "It is far too early to dismiss EA crisis as a key driver," says Chaigneau. With political instability on the rise in Italy – and a positive outcome there for markets appearing less and less likely – there could be some turmoil. Italian political instability doesn't come at a great time because of the German federal elections in September. Should Italian bond yields rise to unsustainable levels, Italy will likely find itself without much support from German politicians looking to get re-elected at home. That's the recipe for another shockwave, which Chaigneau says "will be strong enough to undermine the euro in the coming months, and more so now that the key 1.2930/70 area is broken."
Many of the biggest banks in the United States got the green light from theÂ Federal ReserveÂ Thursday on plans to return profits to shareholders. Two banks,Â JPMorgan ChaseÂ and Goldman Sachs, got yellow lights. The Federal Reserve is requiring them to submit new plans that will address what the regulators say are weaknesses in their planning processes.Â  Ally Financial andÂ BB&amp;T CorporationÂ had their plans rejected by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve said that fourteen had submitted plans that satisfied its tests. Those banks areÂ American Express Company;Â Bank of America Corporation;The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation;Â Capital One Financial Corporation;Â Citigroup;Â Fifth Third Bancorp;Â KeyCorp;Â Morgan Stanley;Â The PNC Financial Services Group;Â Regions Financial Corporation;Â State Street Corporation;Â SunTrust Banks;Â U.S. Bancorp; andÂ Wells Fargo. Last week, the Fed announced the results of its so-calledÂ stress tests. The Fed said that 17 of the 18 large banks reviewed had enough capital to withstand a severe recession.Â  In the announcement today, the Fed revealed the results of its look at the dividend and buyback plans for each of the 18 banks for the next year. The process, officially known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review or CCAR, is now in its third year. "Strong capital levels help ensure that banking organizations have the ability to lend to households and businesses and to continue to meet their financial obligations, even in times of economic difficulty," the Fed said in a press release. The Fed evaluates each of the banks' plans and their planning process. Its determination of whether or not to approve a capital plan depends, in part, on whether the bank would have sufficient capital after a proposed dividend or buyback to meet its financial obligations in a severe economic downturn. It also looks at the process the banks use to arrive at their proposals and how the banks would measure up under the new international bank capital requirements known as Basel 3. The Fed did not object to the capital plans of Goldman and JPMorgan outright. But it did require each of them to submit new capital plans by the end of the third quarter of this year to "address weaknesses in their capital planning processes." This finding of weakness was not something that was widely anticipated for either Goldman or JPMorgan. A failure to remedy the process would be grounds for rejection of the plans. In the meantime, each of these banks may begin returning profits to shareholders in the form of dividends or buybacks. Goldman and JPMorgan learned of the specifics of the Fed's concerns with their planning processes earlier Thursday. The objection to Ally Financial's plan was widely anticipated as it was the only bank to outright fail last week's stress test. The Fed said Ally's capital plan received an objection both on the grounds that its capital ratios would not meet Fed requirements and that its process for capital planning was inadequate. Ally submitted a revised plan but had this also subjected. The rejection of BB&amp;T's plan is likely to catch many market-watchers off-guard. It was widely expected to ask and receive approval to maintain its current capital plan. The Fed said BB&amp;T's capital plan was objected to based on a qualitative assessment conducted by the Federal Reserve, meaning its capital position would not be strong enough in a stressed economic situation. Two years ago, Bank of America had its plan to increase dividends rejected, an embarrassment after its CEO had promised a dividend hike. Last year it was Citigroup's turn to be surprised, after the Fed said it could not increase its dividend. These reviews were begun in the wake of the financial crisis. The 18 banks subject to the tests paid out 19 percent of their profits in common dividends in 2012, half of what they paid out before the financial crisis in 2006.Â  "The financial crisis showed not only that regulators needed to increase capital requirements and conduct regular stress tests, but also that firms need strong internal processes to evaluate their own capital needs based on their individual risks and circumstances," Federal Reserve Governor Daniel Tarullo said in a statement. The Fed's announcement did not reveal the particular plans of each bank to make dividends or buy back shares. Individual banks are expected to make announcements detailing plans following the Fed announcement. What are bank and financial stocks doing now?Â Click here for the latest quotes.
Business InsiderSallie KrawcheckWomen are pulling ahead of men as the biggest holders of personal wealth in America, and the gap is widening. Still, the $8 trillion they own is usually invested by men, who handle the vast majority of funds under management. Sallie Krawcheck went as high in Wall Street's ranks as any woman has ever gone, holding top positions at a number of brokers, and most recently headed Bank of America's Wealth &amp; Investment and Management division, which includes Merrill Lynch and has over $2 trillion in assets, before a shakeup left her on the outside. Today she is a startup consultant and comments frequently on consumer banking issues on LinkedIn. She talks with U.S. News about the disconnect between women and Wall Street, and how to fix it. Are women better than men at managing money? There has been quite a bit of research that claims to show that women are "better" investors than men. What is clear from the research is that women are more conservative investors than men. So that has been a winning strategy in the tough markets of this century. Whether that holds up in more robust markets, like this more recent bull market, remains to be seen. How else do men and women differ when it comes to money? Women tend to be more conservative in their investments. They tend to trade less. And they choose a financial adviser more slowly than men to. As a result, male financial advisers may give up on winning a woman as a client just when she is about to say yes! That said, once a female commits to a financial adviser, she tends to be a more loyal client than her male counterpart Is there any reason women should want to have female financial advisers? Generalizing about whether women want women financial advisers is a tough one. What I mostly hear from women investors is that they don't think of investing as a game. Many don't think of it as a fun pastime. For them, it represents their safety and security and the lifestyle that they want to have. Financial advisers who recognize this, and who connect with women on these issues, will be the most successful, regardless of their gender. Should more women be pursuing careers as financial advisers? Absolutely. Research has shown that women are client-focused, so this career track can be a very successful one for women. Interestingly, however, the large brokerage firms have stalled out for years at about 17 percent women financial advisers. On the other hand, private banks can be closer to 50 percent. A hypothesis for this difference is the greater team orientation of the private banks in serving clients rather than the traditional "sole practitioner" model for the Big Four. [The largest integrated financial firms: Merrill Lynch, UBS, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney and Wells Fargo.] Is a female wealth manager better off going to an independent firm and building a following outside the Big Four or trying to work at one of the big firms in which women remain very large investors? A woman—or any adviser, for that matter—can be successful in either. It is a question of what type of technology, investing, training and brand support she wants and needs. Each firm is somewhat different in this, though the broad strokes are certainly similar. Financial advisers whose salaries are based on the assets they manage certainly don't want to give any of that up—so how do women break in? Well, the pie can certainly grow, so it doesn't have to be a matter of some advisers giving up assets to other advisers. The need for financial advice in this country is absolutely clear. Would it help Wall Street's business to have more women in those roles? It certainly may help to get more women into adviser and management roles. It will also help to educate male financial advisers on how women may think about and approach money differently. What is Wall Street doing to change? There has been a great deal of change in how the large firms assess and hire financial advisers. Would you believe that one of the large firms used to use a questionnaire from the Marines to assess candidates' suitability for the financial adviser role? As you might imagine, they attracted a certain type of individual, but not an overwhelming number of females! What about women in leadership roles? Another key to attracting more females is having more females in leadership roles. There has been some progress here, but much more is needed. Many women opt out of leadership roles because they have traditionally involved moving one's family from city to city, to take on bigger and bigger office management responsibilities. These firms have to find a different way if they are serious about this issue.

Everyone is talking budgets again. Earlier this week, Paul Ryan introduced his plan to balance the budget in 10 years. Then yesterday the Democrats unveiled a budget that includes stimulus, tax hike, and some long-term deficit reduction So we were fortunate to have Peter Orszag -- Obama's former Office of Management and Budget director and now a VP at Citi -- in for an interview at Business Insider to talk budgets. We'll publish the full interview in the coming weeks, but one interesting part concerns his discussion of the Fiscal Cliff deal, which saw income taxes rise on those making $400,000 or more, but which froze in place the Bush tax cuts for everyone else. People are talking these days that the deal is, in retrospect, problematic, since now Obama can't get additional revenue. Says Orszag: "Objectively, stepping away from the politics of it away for a second, we're going to end up regretting making the middle class tax cuts part of it permanent." Basically, current forecasts for discretionary spending are already unrealistically low out into the future, and freezing in current levels means there's no way the government will have adequate revenue to match realistic spending growth. Either that, or discretionary spending will have to "starve." Produced by Business Insider Video
When corporate insiders buy and sell shares of the company they work for, some people feel compelled to follow. The rationale is simple: no one knows a company better than an insider.  Therefore, they're more likely to buy if things are getting better and they're more likely to sell if they think things will get worse. Unfortunately, the data doesn't seem to support this. Jim Stack of Investech (via Barry Ritholtz) has created this annotated chart of the Dow Jones Industrial Index. It includes some headlines of insider trading activities. The chart speaks for itself. Investech Research via The Big Picture
University of Chicago Booth School of BusinessProminent hedge fund manager Kyle Bass â€“ whose big trade right now, known as the "widowmaker" in market circles, is betting against Japanese government bonds â€“ gave a talk at the University of Chicago last week. During the talk, someone asked him about the Japan trade. People call it the "widowmaker" because a trader will look at Japan's huge pile of public debt â€“ the largest in the world as a percentage of GDP â€“ and bet that it has to blow up. (Right?) The problem for these traders, of course, is that it never does. Bass relayed an interesting story about a conversation he had with a counterparty at "one of the biggest banks in the world." The gist of the story is that "27-year-old kids" have been selling default protection on Japanese government debt (credit default swaps) for insanely cheap â€“ too cheap, thinks Bass â€“ and that the banks are starting to realize that maybe they are underestimating the risk associated with a blowup in the Japanese bond market. That's the vibe Bass gets, anyways, from the conversation with his counterparty â€“ they asked him to close out his trade. "The AIG of the world is back," says Bass. Below is a partial transcription of Bass's comments at the University of Chicago. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The AIG of the world is back. Here's what I mean by that. I have 27-year-old kids selling me one-year jump risk in Japan for less than one basis point. $5 billion worth at a time. You know why? Because it's outside of a 95 percent VaR. It's less than one year to maturity.Â So guess what the regulatory capital hit is for the bank? It rhymes with "hero." Right? And, if the bell tolls at the end of the year, the 27-year-old kid gets a bonus. And if he blows the bank to smithereens, ah. He got a paycheck all year.Â  We're right back there. I mean, the brevity of financial memory is only about two years. I wouldn't sell nuclear holocaust risk in Dallas for less than a basis point. You should be fired for thinking about selling something for less than 50 basis points, you know? And yet, this is happening again.Â  And it's happening in huge size. You know, huge. We bought $0.5 trillion worth of these options. Interestingly enough, recently, one of the biggest banks in the world called me and asked me if I would close my position. That was an interesting day for us. That happened to me in 2007, right before the mortgages cracked.Â  They said, "You know, we ran some new risk tests." And I said, "Really?" And they said, "Yeah, you know, our new stress scenario is a little bit more punitive than the last one." And I said, "Well, what is it?" And he says, "We don't want to share our proprietary secrets of our bank with you." And I said, "OK, then I'm not closing it." And they said, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Well, how about: in our old one, we had rates being stressed 50 basis points, and the new one has rates being stressed 400." And I said, "Ooh, yeah, 400. That would really hurt you on this trade, wouldn't it?" And they said, "Yeah, we'd like to close that one." And I said, "Well, I'd like to, but I'm not going to do that for you, so I'm sorry." But anyway, they are starting to realize. Why would they run a stress test like that? Who would have them run that stress test? This is happening.
Jones DayMichigan Gov. Rick Snyder has tapped Kevyn Orr to take over as Detroit's emergency financial manager. Snyder had announced two weeks ago the state would be commandeering the city's finances as it teeters on the brink of bankruptcy. Orr, who works out of Washington for law firmÂ Jones Day, is best known for handling Chrysler's restructuring in 2009. He closed dealerships in the face of strong opposition from industry groups. â€œIn many respects itâ€™s a sad day,â€ Snyder said Thursday afternoon during a news conference in Detroit, according to the New York Times' Monica Davey. "But again I like to say itâ€™s an opportunity.â€
AP/Sang TanIt's the worst case scenario for an investor: You make a deal and your counterparty refuses to pay. Time to go to Court. Terrible, of course, but a group of American investors are living a nightmare that takes that scenario one step farther. Despite having gone to Court and winning every judgement here in the States, they still can't get their money. Somehow, it's stuck in China. Until 2009 venture firms Gobi Partners (based in Shanghai) and Oak Investment Partners owned three quarters of a China-based company called Digital Media Group (DMG). It was an ad firm that sold space on TV screens in public transportation hubs all over the country. That year the investors entered into acquisition talks with a similar (but larger) Chinese-owned ad firm called VisionChina that expressed interest in buying DMG. There was a “strategic logic in putting the companies together,” Ren Riley, a general partner at Oak Investment Partners told Business Insider.  The investors had around 10 years of experience investing in China, and the talks went well. VisionChina's team, they said, were professional, as was Limin Li, the company's CEO. Neither Gobi nor Oak had any reason to expect anything strange. So the parties figured out a deal. To buy DMG, VisionChina agreed to pay $100 million in cash and common stock up front and then to pay $30 million in cash and common stock each year for the next two years — $60 million total. The deal was closed in November of 2009.  A year later, though, when it was time for VisionChina to make its first $30 million payment, they sent DMG's shareholders a lawsuit instead. “This was a publicly traded company listed on the Nasdaq with real lawyers, real bankers, and real research," said Riley. "We had no reason to think this would occur... everything went well, negotiations went well, the deal went well.” In its suit, VisionChina claimed that DMG provided misleading information about its finances during the 2009 acquisition process nullifying their deal.  The parties went to Court in NYC where Judge Charles E. Ramos dismissed VisionChina's claims. To that dismissal, the Judge added an order of attachment requiring VisionChina to make its first $30 million payment to DMG's shareholders. That was November 2011, and DMG's shareholders say they still haven't gotten their money. The problem is that VisionChina, a publicly traded company in the United States, has no assets in the United States. That means for DMG's shareholders to get paid, the money has to leave China. VisionChina is arguing that there's no way for them to do that. So all DMG shareholders can do is win legal skirmish after legal skirmish — and that's what they've done. When the second $30 million payment deadline passed in November 2011, Judge Ramos granted a second order of attachment.  In August of 2012, the Court ordered VisionChina to deposit $60 million with the New York State Sheriff. When the company didn't, a Judge ordered VisionChina in contempt of Court. That was just a few months ago. At that hearing, Ramos sounded off on his own skepticism about VisionChina's intentions, Law360 reports: "The record is void of any activity done by your client to comply with this, other than the 3 or 4 million dollars that was outside the People's Republic of China," Judge Ramos told VisionChina's attorneys during the hearing in his downtown Manhattan courtroom, noting that some money the company held outside China has been moved to New York. "This really is bad faith," he said, "You know the old joke, 'I may have been born at night but I wasn't born last night'?" Yahoo FinanceVision China Stock since November 2009There have been suggested compromises. DMG shareholder attorney Thomas Kavaler tried to get his clients' money put in escrow at a bank with branches in China and the U.S. — VisionChina refused, he says. He says he suggested that a Chinese lawyer tend to the money in China — again, that was rebuffed.  “This is a circle; they won't pay; the court orders them to pay; they won't obey,” said Kavaler, a partner at Cahill Gordon &amp; Reindel LLP. And "they" can do this because it's incredibly hard to get a Chinese company's money out of the country and in the hands of foreign investors without the company's cooperation. VisionChina argues that moving the money is up to China's State Administration of Foreign Exhange (SAFE), and that SAFE isn't having it. The Court's response to that argument has basically been... prove it. So in the midst of the SEC's investigation into Chinese auditing firms, and the media hype around Chinese shorts, VisionChina's problem hasn't even been discussed. “It’s important to us," said Riley. "We’re pursuing all our avenues and trying to do business the right way... If we’re going to do business in China our investors want us to fight for their capital. The damages are approaching $100 million and possibly higher. It’s our money.” DMG shareholder losses aside, this is a story of value destruction all around. VisionChina's stock is down around 98% since it bought DMG (see the chart to your left). That prompted DMG's shareholders to create a website called SaveVisionChina.com, detailing the blow by blow of their legal action. VisionChina's lawyer has yet to respond to multiple requests for comment. “We are considering all of our options, including legal and diplomatic, and if VisionChina does not meet its legal obligations, we believe China will be sending a message that it is a hostile, risky and unfair place for investment by foreign-owned businesses,” Riley added. On February 19th, Judge Ramos ordered VisionChina to deposit $60 million in a U.S. escrow account by March 15, 2013. The question remains though, what if they don't?

Don't Expect Further Strong Gains In US Stocks (Capital Economics) At the beginning of the year, John Higgins of Capital Economics was among the strategists who forecasted gains for the stock market.Â  Specifically, he said the S&amp;P 500 would hit 1,550 by mid-year. But now he warns things are getting stretched. "We are not convinced that equities are poised to rack up further substantial gains, though," he writes.Â  "Admittedly, the Fed is unlikely to take away the punchbowl in the near future as the economy slowly recovers. But there are signs in the relatively poor performance of other asset classes (such as emerging market equities and commodities) that the power of quantitative easing to boost the prices of â€œriskyâ€ assets is fading. Profit margins also remain stretched, which should restrain earnings growth, while the price that investors are willing to pay for earnings is high from a historical perspective â€“ even if we allow for some structural changes that may have affected the â€œfairâ€ value of the market over time. Finally, we continue to think that the crisis in the euro-zone could flare up again. The upshot is that we are sticking for now to our year-end forecast of 1,500."  What's Been Driving The Dow Jones Industrial Average (Crossing Wall Street) Much has been made about the new all-time record highs in the Dow, a price-weighted index of just 30 stocks. Eddy Elfenbein notes that much of the gains have been driven by just one stock, which is up around 175 percent since August 2006. "Much of the heavy lifting is due to Big Blue," he writes.Â  "Thanks to price-weighting, IBM is the largest component of the Dow. It currently makes up 11.3% of the index." There Are Investment Opportunities In Europe (Cumberland Advisors) The eurozone is in recession.Â  But that doesn't mean their aren't investing opportunities in the region. Bill Witherell discusses why you might want to consider Europe. Among other things, he reminds us that stocks aren't the economy. "The first reason is that there is surprisingly very little correlation on a year-to-year basis between GDP growth and stocks, even in terms of direction."Â  He notes that by the time the good economic news starts to come out, it'll already be priced into the market. Insider Selling Is Not A Good Stock Market Indicator (The Big Picture) Corporate insiders probably know more about their company than anyone else.Â  So, some people believe that when insiders sell their stock holdings, then it's probably a good idea for others to follow. However, historical data show that this theory doesn't hold. "In other words, corporate insiders are just as dumb as the rest of you Humans!" writes Barry Ritholtz. The Big Picture  US Tax Cheats Get Nailed After Their Advisor Send A Letter (Bloomberg) "Over an 11-year period, federal prosecutors charge, Swiss financial adviser Singenberger helped 60 people in the U.S. hide $184 million in secret offshore accounts bearing colorful names like Real Cool Investments Ltd. and Wanderlust Foundation," report David Voreacos and Patricia Hurtado. "Then, according to a prosecutor, Singenberger inadvertently mailed a list of his U.S. clients, including their names and incriminating details, which somehow wound up in the hands of federal authorities."
This afternoon, Rand Paul took the stage at CPAC, the annual conservative political convention, and he had nothing nice to say about Wall Street. Check out this tweet from Politico reporter, Alex Burns: Twitter, aburnspolitico Paul is just lending his voice to an idea that's picking up traction in the Republican party â€” letting Wall Street go. When Marco Rubio met with private equity boss Steve Schwarzman last month he got flack from all sides of the party, not just Tea Partiers like Paul who've been anti-Wall Street from the start. Check out this excerpt from WSJ columnist (and former Reagan speech writer) Peggy Noonan's reaction: "I'm going to steer this party away from Wall Street and toward what used to be called Main Street and doesn't have a name anymore. Our economy won't take off again until our pigsty of a tax code is cleaned up. People have to feel everyone's being treated fairly, that the rich aren't calling the shots and gaming the system. And all future growth could be stymied if you guys make a half-trillion-dollar wrong bet tomorrow because some trader in London was high as a kite on Ambien. That could bring down the system the way it crashed in '08. So we have to change the system. Too big to fail is too big to live.â€ Then there's the fact that Louisiana Republican Senator David Vitter is teaming up with a Democrat (Ohio's Sherrod Brown) to write anti-Too Big To Fail legislation. They presented on it earlier this month. Finally, this anti-Wall Street vibe has trickled down to the Republican lead House Financial Services Committee. Chair Jeb Hensarling is described on their website as a "strong conservative," and this is what his committee put out on Facebook page yesterday. House Financial Services Committee, Facebook Brace yourselves, bankers. Â 
U.S. Air Force Dave Wood enjoys something most members of the US military do not. He has the luxury of performing poorly in his job and living to tell about it. Mr. Wood published a Huffington Post article earlier this year originally titled “After a Decade of Lavish Benefits, Military Personnel Fear Cuts.”  This lamentable array of words, a cheap literary hook designed to ensnare fiscally paranoid readers by construing military members as trough-feeding elites defensively crouched over burgeoning piles of cash, was inexplicably changed Tuesday.  But not before Mr. Wood managed to rack up nearly 40,000 votes of approval on Facebook.  And not before he managed to cultivate an ugly and undeserved myth that can only harm the soul of a nation: the myth that America’s fighting men and women are some sort of high-on-the-hog mercenary force.  Nothing could be further from the truth. Mr. Wood, though you’re likely to never read these words, let me address you directly as a veteran. I understand that you’re against war in general.  I understand you were against the invasion of Iraq. It might surprise you just how many veterans agree with you on these matters.  But sir, despite your admirable credentials and even given the benefit of the doubt, you’ve managed to pen an article so careless with the image of the American veteran that it should not have seen the light of day.  I assume without meaning to do so, you’ve insulted the quiet, unassuming ethic of the American veteran by saying things that beg to be challenged, thereby inviting your subjects to defend themselves against your words, which they do at the risk of appearing prideful, something almost universally abhorred in the veteran culture. via U.S. ArmySo I appeal to you, Mr. Wood.  Before you pick up your pen again, take care in your thoughts and how you express them.  Take care that you don’t express manifestly incorrect notions that your readership, trusting your Pulitzer credentials and your evident sensibility, might wrongly share, forward, and ultimately, legitimize. To say that military pay and benefits have “soared far above civilian comparison” is either misguided or disingenuous, but in either case, deeply wrong.  To the extent military pay and benefits have been kept competitive, this has been necessary to keep enough qualified warriors in uniform to get the job done.  If anything, the use of pay has been a cynical instrument employed to prevent mass abandonment of an activity bent on grinding people and their families into a fine powder.  The level of sacrifice asked of our military in recent years is historically unprecedented, and America’s warriors are not getting rich enduring it.  In fact, 1.5 million of them need food stamps to supplement their incomes, scores have trouble finding post-service employment, and tens of thousands will live the rest of their lives without ever being made whole again, having left things on the battlefield that defy monetary valuation. Military members make their decisions concerning whether or not to stay in uniform on the basis of many criteria, pay and benefits among these. Each family has its own situation and hence its own calculus. C’est la guerre.  But until machine press operators and gas station attendants start spending 12 months away from their families and living constantly under the threat of getting blown apart by an IED, you and your readers should consider any comparison of military and civilian pay fundamentally invalid. Geoffrey IngersollBut just out of curiosity … who exactly do you think is overpaid?  Generalities are fun, but whose “lavish” pay should be slashed?  The 20-year-old Ohioan struggling to understand Pashto while he orchestrates installation of a water filtration system in a village that has resisted improvement since before Alexander the Great?  Maybe the 32-year-old Californian responsible for guiding a 50,000-pound aircraft moving at the speed of sound to a precise point in time and space where she will deliver a Volkswagen-sized munition to a point on the Earth no bigger than a hopscotch court … knowing she will kill her own teammates or allow the enemy to kill them if she gets it wrong?  Or maybe the 40-year-old Floridian whose success is defined by whether his ability to train, motivate, inspire, and focus the 500 people in his charge will be enough to keep them alive in a war where neither the enemy nor the objective are understood and the source of the next attack is never known?  You’re not talking about “personnel” my friend … you’re talking about “people.”  Individuals with talents, capabilities, and courage that scare the living hell out of enemies.  They are a bargain at twice the current rate, fiscal pressures be damned. But while we’re on the point. People don’t make Master Sergeant in the Army in 10 years and they certainly don’t make Brigadier General in 16 years.  But if they did, why would the pay you decry be so unreasonable?  We’re talking about educated, capable, fit, ingenious men and women capable of taking life one minute, saving it the next, then opening a homeless shelter before sundown.  They work tirelessly and sleep optionally.  I’ve been known to bash a general or two in my time, but the vast majority of them could step into any boardroom in America and, before the first coffee mug hit the table, instantly distill the winners and losers in the room, mentally devise a strategy for the next six months of corporate operations, and spend the next hour memorizing the names of the children and pets of everyone in the room. These people you construe as fat cats are not “ordinary people doing extraordinary things” as the old trope goes.  They are extraordinary people making amazing things look easy.  The real question is whether a country manifestly out of touch with the true costs of the foreign activism it serially endorses is deserving of their selflessness. via Kevin HanrahanWhat is not in question is that their families deserve Sainthood.  Your assertions that day care and counseling services are overfunded would be laughable if the entire subject matter weren’t already submerged in an ocean of tears that’s been swelling for a dozen years.  Disabuse yourself of the notion that parents enjoy spending a year or more without their counterparts, forced to leave their children with strangers if they dare seek to a trip to the movie theater.  And when these patient and brave spouses who have selflessly given away a normal relationship with their mate in the name of Afghan or Iraqi freedom sense themselves approaching the rocky shoals of sanity, they need only dial an 800 number to receive some of that Cadillac counseling you wrote about.  Many of the things you see as overfunded enhancements are actually viewed as running jokes within the military.  The kind told by sad comics.  In other words, you have your cross-hairs on the wrong target. Aim at the bureaucracies unable to effectively manage the resources generously provided by the American people and you’ll have something closer to a valid critique.  Aim at the politicians who flung us into undeclared and under-resourced wars, and you’ll have the root cause dead to rights. US Navy via flickrThere’s plenty of room for reform in national defense.  Operations are not immune to waste, and anecdotally, there are unnecessary deployments still taking place in our war effort.  With a price tag of one million dollars per warrior per year deployed, this is the real story for reform-minded journalists looking to cast a light on costly inefficiencies.  You ask or imply valid questions about whether commissaries and exchanges should be reformed, and it’s fair to ask retirees like me to pay a little more for health care. In fact, I agree with the seed of your column, which seems to hold that undue deference to the military is inappropriate, and can actually poison the civil-military discourse we depend upon to ensure the lives of our men and women are not cheaply risked.  A bit more journalistic bravado in challenging military leaders a decade ago, for example, might have disrupted the march to war in Iraq, a debacle directly responsible for nearly all of the consequences your article bemoans.  But all these points aside, your article was far more wrong than right. When military people are wrong, their teammates die. Airplanes hit mountains. Artillery shells fall on civilians. Incorrect targets are bombed.  Ships run aground. Military servants are unable to comprehend consequence-free failure, which is why some are mystified that the tone and substance of your article continue uncorrected.  Whatever your intent, you were wrong, Mr. Wood.  In the immortal words of Colonel Nathan R. Jessup, “you have that luxury.”  And I know many who will continue making certain you and I and others have that luxury … by laying their lives on the line.
We all recall the Greenspan Put. This was a term coined in the 90â€²s as market participants came to understand that then Fed chairman Alan Greenspan would lower the FedÂ fundsÂ rate and provide liquidity when the market got hit. It wasÂ perceivedÂ as downside protection, hence the term â€˜putâ€™. Thereâ€™s a similar downside protection phenomena at work today in the market that is psychologically based and it has to do with high sentiment reactivity. Essentially, weâ€™re getting elements of sentiment that look like bearish capitulation extremes even on minor pull backs. Hereâ€™s a definition: The Freudian Put:Â Downside protection created by high negative reactivity on a market pull back and/or news where some aspects of sentiment move to bearish extremes unusually quickly â€“ aspects that have been historically reserved for larger market bottoms. Â  Hereâ€™s what I mean by sentiment reactivity. If sentiment is neutral or somewhat positive and the market is rising or stable, a sudden knee jerk and pronounced negative shift in sentiment will occur. Many get very bearish, almost panicky, very fast. I have alluded to this reactivity previously &amp;Â recently wrote:Â we have been conditioned for this and are just waiting for the next shoe to drop as shoes have been dropping left and right for 14 years now. Even as the market continues to grind higher and make all time highs across multipleÂ indicesÂ and sectors, sentiment has remained highly reactive to the downside. The most recent example of The Freudian Put in effect comes from examining the media/pundit reaction to the most recent pull back. On February 20th the SP 500 fell 19 points (1.25%) and another 9 points on February 21st. Hereâ€™s some prominent examples of market press from February 21st all of which got huge play: 1.Â GARTMAN: We Are Exiting All Bullish Positions and Rushing to the SidelinesÂ â€“ Gartmanâ€™s apocalyptic comments about â€œtectonic platesâ€ and â€œearthquakesâ€ got gobbled up like stuffing.Â via TBI 2.Â Doug Kass: â€˜Iâ€™m As Bearish As Iâ€™ve Been In Some Timeâ€™Â â€“ Kass, who usually dances to the beat of his own drummer also seems like he was affected by the Fed minutes and relatively big down day.Â via WSJ 3.Â Marc Faber Warns: â€˜Market Has Peaked Outâ€™Â â€“ The media used to trot out Faber only at market extremes but now he gets play on two days of selling.Â via CNBC. Phil Pearlman/StockTwits Yup, February 21st was a bearish media tsunami off one pull back that is now looking like a blip. This is sentiment reactivity. This is The Freudian Put. Now you will know what to look for to see if the Freudian Put remains in effect when the market turns lower for a day or a week or, perhaps, 40 trading days which was the approximateÂ time spanof both of 2012â€²s 2 corrections. Sentiment indicators will gap negative, the media will press fear and your aunt Ika will call you and ask nervously if you should be out of the market.
Brown Harris StevensCurbed reports that "Chateau Aromois", a beautiful East Hampton home built by late value investor Christopher Browne, is on sale for $22.9 million.Â  The five-bedroom, five and half bathroom home listed by Brown Harris Stevens was originally put on the market for $28.5 million.Â  Browne, a famous value investor and the co-founder of mutual fund company Tweedy Browne, did much of the lush landscaping on the property himself, according to Curbed. He died three years ago of a heart attack. He was 62. It's definitely a dream home and now we're going to take a photo tour.Â 
James Shepard/FlickrDeutsche Bank's global head of FX strategy, Bilal Hafeez, recently gave a speech at the annual Deutsche Bank Mittelstand (small and medium-sized enterprises) FX conference in Hamburg, Germany. The bank's research department transcribed Hafeez's speech and sent it out to clients in a note. The speech focuses on the euro area's economic woes and the need for the currency bloc to move forward with further integration in order to be economically successful. Hafeez opens the speech with a reflection on parenting and a child's years as a "terrible teen." The gist is that euro member states are behaving like infighting teens â€“ which is preventing further integration â€“ and they needÂ a role model that everyone across Europe can respect. "I can only think of one figure that is respected by most Europeans and has never sinned, Jesus!" said Hafeez. Read the excerpt from Hafeez's speech below. ------------------------------------------------------------- Europeâ€™s Saviour Who else has entered the terrible teens? The Euro-Area! It was born in 1999, and so is currently fourteen years old. It has all the hallmarks of teenage angst. It is ridden with internal conflicts, it is groping around for structure, and it is suspicious of authority. So who can be a positive role model for the Euro-Area? Well it cannot be the â€œfathersâ€: Germany or France. It has to be an external figure that all Europeans respect, and whose motives and character are beyond dispute. That rules out anyone living as even the most competent person will make missteps or have something from their past dredged up to undermine them. That leaves us with historical figures whose lives have been laid bare by history. I can only think of one figure that is respected by most Europeans and has never sinned, Jesus! Whoâ€™s to blame, and who is blameless  If everyone in the Euro-area would adopt the principle of not casting stones unless they were without sin then the constant accusations would stop. And remember, everyone has breached agreements in one way or another, even the stronger countries like Germany and France. How so? Well, all Euro-area countries were supposed to follow the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), which amongst other things imposed a limit on of fiscal deficits of 3% and of government debt to GDP of 60%. Both Germany and France breached the SGP in the early 2000s and suffered no penalties. I should add that both Ireland and Spain met the SGP rules before 2008. So blaming â€œweakerâ€ countries for not following agreements rings hollow.  If everyone held back their accusatory stones and instead focused on the future, then we may have a clearer vision of things to come. The two pressing issues for the Euro-area are the impact of austerity and the survival of the Euro-area in its current form.
Here's a helpful cheat sheet on global monetary policy, courtesy of Morgan Stanley's Global Economics team. As you can see, the U.S., Japan, the Euro Area, and the U.K. are way at the bottom. Morgan Stanley "Normally, when economies are recovering, central banks typically start to think about the exit and take the foot off the accelerator," wrote Morgan Stanley's Joachim Fels.Â  "In our view, this time is different." They give four reasons why they expect central banks to stay easy. We summarize: "We see global growth reaching close to 4% in 2H13 and in 2014," wrote Fels.Â  "However, twilight still rules in the near term and we expect most central banks to remain supportive or even ease further this year."
The word from men's high fashion lines this spring is that the popped collar is back, reports the WSJ. The look has been spotted on runways from J Crew to Armani. But before you rewatch all of your John Hughes movies to get just the right pop, note that the 2013 trend is slightly different from the old 1980s look. From WSJ: The modern upturned collar is a nonchalant flourish meant to give an outfit a little flair. It draws on the Italian concept of sprezzatura—an expression of style meant to look spontaneous—that has infiltrated menswear in recent years, showing up in rolled-up pants cuffs a few years ago and pocket squares spilling out of the pocket in an apparently unstudied way. So yeah, pair it with a pocket square. For the full story, head to WSJ&gt;
The sudden resignation on Wednesday of Henrik Fisker, co-founder and executive chairman of hybrid electric automaker Fisker, puts the company's already uncertain future on even shakier ground. In a statement sent to Autocar, Henrik Fisker cited "major disagreements" with "executive management on the business strategy." In its own statement, the carmaker said its strategy has not changed, and that Fisker's departure should not impact its partnerships or financing. Whatever the details, it is another troubling sign for the hybrid automaker, which is seeking new financing after vastly underperforming growth expectations from September 2009, when it received a $528.7-million conditional loan from the Department of Energy. For the White House, Fisker has the making of another green loan going bad. A Troubled History The $528.7 million loan was part of the DOE's Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing program, created by the 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act to allocate $25 billion to fund highly fuel-efficient vehicles. Fisker was expected toÂ save or create at least 5,000 jobs and build a manufacturing plant in Delaware that would produce as many as 100,000 cars annually. More than three years later, however, Fisker has sold only around 2,000 of its high-end Karma model, a car riddled with problems. FiskerHenrik Fisker co-founded Fisker Automotive. Since the $110,000 Karma first reached customers in 2011, it has been recalled three times, and its 54 mpg is considered lackluster for a plug-in hybrid. Consumer Reports gave it a failing grade. Just as fellow electric carmakerÂ Tesla followed its Roadster with the more practical and affordable Model S, Fisker means to build on the Karma with the Atlantic.  The mid-size sedan was originally meant to go into production in 2012, and sell for around $50,000. In October, Fisker delayed production of the Atlantic to late 2014. On a conference call discussing the delay, Posawatz confirmed the importance of the new model: "The Atlantic is really the volume car that begins to build growth." That same day, A123 Systems, which provided the lithium ion batteries used by Fisker, filed for bankruptcy. Before the end of November, Fisker halted production of the Karma, due to a lack of new batteries. (A123 has been purchased by Wanxiang, China's largest auto part maker, with US government approval, and courts are now dealing with A123's bankruptcy payment plan, according to Fox Business. It's still not clear if it will continue to provide batteries to Fisker.) Meanwhile Fisker has a history of leadership issues, going through three CEOs in a bit more than a year. Former Chrysler CEO Tom LaSorda took over for Henrik Fisker in February 2012. He was replaced by GM veteran Tony Posawatz in August,Â according to Autoblog, who is still at the helm. Uncertain Future Fisker has not had access to federal cash since May 2011, when the Department of Energy froze its loan due to Fisker's failure to meet certain deadlines. A Department of Energy spokesperson confirmed to Business Insider the loan is still frozen, but said the Department will continue to work with Fisker moving forward, and that the automaker could see its access to the money renewed at some point. The automaker had already spent $193 million, a bit more than the portion of the loan set aside for investing in the Karma. The loss of that money was a major blow for Fisker, which counted on the remaining $335 million for getting the Delaware plant up and running. Fisker has raised $1.2 billion in private equity over the past several years, according to Forbes, but it needs more to meet even the late 2014 production date for the Atlantic. "We need financing or a partner," spokesman Russel Datz told USA Today in January, a month after Fisker announced it had hired investment bank Evercore Partners to help if find potential buyers and investors, according to the Wall Street Journal. Coming Backlash In October 2011, DOE Office of Public Affairs director Dan Leistikow justified loans to Fisker and Tesla, saying "cutting our dependence on foreign oil means taking some risks." That caveat won't go far, however, considering the harsh backlash following the bankruptcy of solar panel manufacturer Solyndra, which received aÂ $535-million loan from the Obama Administration. Travis Okulski / Business InsiderThe Fisker Atlantic.Although the Solyndra and Fisker loans were part of different programs â€” and the DOE could potentially recoup funds from Fisker â€” many would see a Fisker bankruptcy as a repeat of the Solyndra fiasco, and the nearly empty Delaware plant as a symbol of poorly thought out and administered federal loans. Questions from elected officials began months ago: In October, the House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Government Reform wrote a letter to DOE Secretary Steven Chu, accusing the Department of mishandling the Solyndra case, and of "withholding important documents regarding" the Fisker loan. In July 2012, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney described the federal loan to Fisker as "the kind of crony capitalism that does not create jobs," according to Inc. If Fisker does not find financing from an American source â€” and the Journal reports Fisker is looking for investors primarily in China and Europe â€” those accusations will have merit. As it stands, Fisker's best bet for financing may be from China's Geely Automobile, Forbes reported. That may save the company, but it will mean that a foreign automaker will have a majority stake in a company on which the American people spent nearly $200 million. Unless Fisker pulls out a miracle, the loan will go down as another mistake for the White House.
REUTERS/Edgar Su The big economic news was yesterday's blazing hot retail sales number for February. It crushed expectations, and shook off any suggestion that the end of the Payroll Tax Holiday was hurting the recovery. Over at the Daily Beast, Daniel Gross had a funny take that the American shopper as the real hero of the day, bravely going into Costcos and Ambercrombie &amp; Fitch stores. Why is the shopper going so strong? It comes down to three charts. The first is one that Henry Blodget posted this morning. Debt service costs relative to disposable incomes are finally back to multi-decade lows. Finally, debt isn't so much of a burden. Vincent Reinhart, Morgan Stanley This has led to an even more important phenomenon. The great debt deleveraging is coming to an end. Last week the Fed released Q4 "Flow Of Funds" data, which reveals the assets and liabilities of American households and corporations. This chart from Dan Greenhaus at BTIG shows that the pace of contraction in mortgage debt is slowing dramatically. In fact, on a sequential basis, mortgage debt is about to rise. BTIG The defining characterization of the latest bust was the sharp and basically unprecedented collapse in debt. The end of this trend is a huge boost to the economy. Dan Greenhaus told Business Insider: "The process of reducing debt burdens, particularly so by the consumer, has been a major impediment to economic growth.  If this process is closer to the end than the beginning, which almost surely is the case, then holding all else constant, the bias for consumption going forward is to the upside.  By extension, the bias for the overall economy has to be to the upside as well." Not everyone agrees that the deleveraging is totally over, but actually it's just the trend that counts. Goldman's top economist Jan Hatzius told Business Insider:   "My view is that the private sector deleveraging is not yet over, as I think that private debt/income will still decline further.  However, I think the pace of deleveraging is slowing; that implies a reduction in the private sector financial surplus, and an increase in spending relative to income; and that in turn means a positive impulse to growth.  However, I think that growth for most of this year will still be subdued as the government is moving in the other direction.  Next year should be more clearly positive, as fiscal retrenchment slows sharply but the private sector impulse remains strongly positive." The end of the deleveraging — or at least the declining pace of deleveraging — means that consumers are ready to spend again. And they have a lot of catching up to do. As this chart from Dan Greenhaus shows, consumer spending since the beginning of this recovery has been incredibly subdued compared to other recoveries. Dan Greenhaus, BTIG With the end of deleveraging, just the return to normal shopping habits is a big boost. Bottom line: Debt payments relative to income are basically back in line with history. That means that credit is finally ready to start expanding again. And the American consumer has a lot of catching up to do.
Saint Venus Theater, MyspaceThe latest Wall Street secret to bubble up to the surface is Saint Venus Theater, the secret roving strip club that was created just for bankers. The New York Post did a big story on the underground, application-based, members-only strip club yesterday. It was started three years ago by a mysterious man named Rob S. for his finance buddies. The main draw of Saint Venus Theater for its members is that the girls are amateurs. They're seen as good girls because they have day jobs such as internships at fashion startups and assistant positions at galleries, but they strip at night to make some extra cash.  SVT meets three times a week in secret locations throughout New York City disclosed only to its members via a private email list. Business Insider obtained a copy of SVT's discreet e-mail list to get a look at how the entire business operates. It's posted below, but before you dig in (the e-mail does say read everything, after all) here are some sections that caught our attention.

WikipediaThe penthouse apartment that belonged to late investor Martin Zweig could soon hit the market for between $100 million and $120 million, sources told The New York Post. The penthouse, inside The Pierre on Fifth Avenue and Central Park, is a 12,000-square-foot triplex with a ballroom, four terraces, and views of Central Park, according to Curbed NY. Zweig, a stock investor, investment advisor, and financial analyst, died in February. He paid $21.5 million for the penthouse back in 1999, setting a real estate record at the time. He tried — but failed — to sell it for $70 million several years ago, according to Curbed. The apartment has not yet been officially listed. But if it is listed for more than $100 million, it will become the most expensive apartment for sale in New York City. Ex-Citigroup CEO Sandy Weill's penthouse at 15 Central Park West sold last year for a record $88 million.
Albert Edwards, the bearish strategist over at Societe Generale, thinks inflation is coming to the U.S. "Note the recent release of the US Productivity and Cost data shows that the upward charge in unit labour costs is intensifying," writes Edwards in his latest research note. "Most economists consider unit labour costs to be the principle driver of inflation and we can see from the chart below that core CPI inflation ebbs and flows with unit labour costs (we use a 2y% ch on the labour cost data to smooth excessive volatility Â–hence it misleadingly appears that CPI leads slightly). After drifting downward for the last year to below 2%, core inflation may be set to rise more rapidly as unit labour cost inflation drags it higher. This would undoubtedly hurt an already jittery bond market." Here's his chart: Societe Generale Edwards, however, is a bond bull.Â  And inflation is bad news for bonds. He clarifies that he thinks any inflation will be a brief blip in what he believes is a long-term bull market in bonds.Â  His ongoing forecast is that deflation is the big risk and it will eventually bringing stocks down. "Unlike the (equity) bulls who believe that the economy is strengthening and beginning to lift off, I believe we are either in recession already (as the ECRI thinks) or close to the end of the cycle, which it should be noted is already longer than average," he writes. "The rise in unit labour costs, driven as it is by rapidly stalling productivity growth, is a warning to investors that cyclical gloom lies ahead. "Hence in my view any rise in core inflation will prove short-lived and should not be taken as bearish for bonds, but instead the prelude for the next leg down in yields."
AP There has been lots of action in the mobile industry this week. First, Samsung is launching a much-anticipated new smartphone in New York this evening--a phone that many observers think will vault it ahead of Apple and the rest of the smartphone industry. The existing version of this phone, the Galaxy S3, has already put Samsung on a par with Apple, with many phone buyers preferring the Galaxy's large screen to the smaller one on Apple's iPhone 5. Samsung's new phone, the Galaxy S4, will be even bigger, and it is also expected to have several other new features that may make the iPhone look old and boring in comparison. (See pictures of Samsung's new phone here). Samsung, the Korean TV giant, has come out of nowhere over the last few years to become the world's largest smartphone seller. This rise has surprised both Wall Street and Apple. Apple's stock has tanked. And with Samsung now poised to leap past Apple, Apple executives are suddenly on the defensive. This week, in a surprising move that has rubbed even Apple fans the wrong way, one of Apple's senior executives, Phil Schiller, gave interviews to the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg in which he trashed the Android operating system that powers Samsung phones. The points that Schiller made about Android--that it is "fragmented" into different versions and that it's not as simple a consumer experience as Apple's operating system--were reasonable. But coming as they did on Samsung's big launch day, the comments seemed defensive, classless, and even desperate. Apple's founder and CEO, Steve Jobs, was famous for trashing his competitors' products. But Jobs' picked his spots carefully. His criticisms came on Apple conference calls or at Apple events. He didn't try to steal competitors' thunder on their product launch days. Also, in the days when Jobs was ridiculing the competition, Apple really was miles ahead of everyone. Now, after a couple of years in which competitors like Samsung have out-innovated Apple, it no longer is. So the sudden show of bravado seems even more tone deaf. The other big development in the smartphone industry this week is that the executive who has built Google's Android operating system from the ground up, Andy Rubin, is being replaced by another Google executive. Google appears to want to "unify" its two operating systems, Android and a laptop-based operating system called Chrome. This move makes strategic sense: In a world in which "mobile" is now a continuum between laptops and phones (with tablets in between), it's silly to maintain two separate operating systems. And it looks as though, in this unification, Google has chosen between two executives and decided to have the new combined effort led by Chrome boss Sundar Pichai. In a trend that is reminiscent of the PC industry in the 1980s and 1990s, the Android operating system has become the dominant global mobile operating system over the last several years. Apple's operating system, meanwhile, iOS, has been reduced to a niche player. In "platform markets" like these, in which third-party companies build apps and services that run on top of these operating systems, market share is very important. So if Samsung's new phone is a big hit, and Google's Android continues to gain global market share, Apple's challenges are only going to increase.

Nine in ten of America's fastest-growing counties by population are in states that went for Mitt Romney in November, according to new Census data.  Only Fredericksburg, Virginia made the cut among blue states. Growth in the rest was largely driven by America's oil boom, the Census said. The data's for July 2011 through July 2012.Â Here's the list: Meanwhile, eight in ten metro areas (population 50,000 or more) are in red states. And the two that aren't are both in the same state, Florida. Here's the list: The percentage is even larger for micro areas â€” Pullman, Washington, home of Washington State University, is the lone blue state representative:

CNBCThe Dow Jones Industrial Average is on track to make another all-time record closing high. The S&amp;P 500 is now withing a handful of points from its all-time record closing high. But in terms of the pace of the rally, there's nothing special about this. This is according to BTIG's Dan Greenhaus (via Art Cashin), From this morning's Cashin's Comments: Déjà Vu, All Over Again – As media pundits trip over each other talking about the "longest equity bull run since….", we may all be losing perspective amidst the happy hype. In his wonderful evening wrap-you for clients, the ever-alert, Dan Greenhaus, restored a little perspective to where we are. There has been endless chatter about the terrific start to the year, about the great rotation and about growing optimism about economic and market fundamentals. Those are all worthy topics but we must advance one important point to put this in perspective; the S&amp;P 500 is up just short of 9% YTD. That’s a good start to the year no doubt and better than what we saw in 2010 and 2011. But at this point in 2012? The S&amp;P 500 was higher by 11% and as of 46 days into the year, 2013 is exactly where 2012 was. So while ebullience is spreading like wildfire, justified to some degree, there isn’t anything special about this rally, at least that we didn’t see just one year ago. Here's the chart Greenhaus included in his note. BTIG
Scott Sassa, President of Hearst Entertainment &amp; Syndication, was asked to resign after texts surfaced between him and an LA stripper, sources told The New York Post today. Sassa reportedly met the woman in Los Angeles back in December. The pair began a sexting relationship, and she sent Sassa explicit photographs, the Post reported. Then it all went wrong. According to The Post: The LA stripper, helped by a boyfriend, then tried to blackmail Sassa â€” a single father of two daughters â€” saying sheâ€™d expose their raunchy messages if he didnâ€™t give her money. A second source said, â€œShe made a list of demands." When Sassa didnâ€™t pay up, the boyfriend e-mailed the sex-text exchanges to horrified Hearst honchos, including CEO Frank Bennack Jr., Hearst Magazines president David Carey and Michael Clinton, president of marketing for the magazines. He was asked to resign on Tuesday, and will reportedly receive a "large compensation package." Sassa's LinkedIn still reads that he is the President of Hearst Entertainment, but the Post says he has updated his Facebook page to sayÂ â€œformer president of Hearst Entertainment.â€ He had previously held jobs as CEO at Friendster, NBC, and Turner Broadcasting.

The deal for the 5,000-square-foot apartment, located at 21 East 26th St, closed last month, sources told the Post. The apartment has four bedrooms and 6.5 bathrooms, and the living room boasts sweeping views of the park.

One of the greatest scientific discoveries in the our modern history may not have been possible without Brazil's richest family, the Salles, Bloomberg reports. Physicists believe they're very close to finding Higgs boson, the so-called "God particle". It's a subatomic particle that would help explain what gives matter all over the universe its size and shape. The Salles family produce niobium, an element that makes steel more flexible and strong. Niobium is used in a 10th of all the world's steel â€” in everything from cars to cameras. The Salles control 85% of the material, and it was also used to make the magnets in the world's largest particle accelerator, the $10 billion Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland. Without the high-energy proton collisions the machine creates, scientists would not have been able to come so close to Higgs boson. The Salles first got into niobium in 1965, when a U.S. Navy Admiral convinced Brazilian banker and diplomat Walther Moreira Salles to back his venture to produce niobium. Moreira Salles bought a majority stake in the company.  From Bloomberg: That market dominance has helped make the mogulâ€™s heirs Brazilâ€™s richest family. His four sons, Fernando, Pedro, Joao and Walter, control a combined fortune of $27 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The brothers do not currently appear on any international wealth ranking. â€œWe created the whole market,â€ Tadeu Carneiro, chief executive officer of Cia. Brasileira de Metalurgia &amp; Mineracao, the familyâ€™s niobium company, said in an interview at his office in Sao Paulo. On his desk lies a chunk of the heavy, lustrous alloy that CBMM sells. â€œNow you see how fantastic this company is -- its value, these dividends -- but we started from zero, when niobium was just a laboratory dream.â€ The company is now worth $13 billion, more than the Salles' $7.1 billion interest in Brazilian bank, Itau. For the whole run down of the Salles' wealth, head to Bloomberg&gt;
Ever since Italian elections yielded inconclusive results a few weeks ago, everyone has been wondering what happens next and how markets will digest the process. Center-left candidate for prime minister Pier Luigi Bersani was expected to come out on top. While he managed to do that, center-right rival Silvio Berlusconi and anti-establishment candidate Beppe Grillo took a bigger share of the vote than anyone expected. Now, Bersani has to form a coalition with one or the other in order to form a government, and both routes could be problematic. (For more on that, click here.) That means Italy could be headed straight back to elections, introducing further uncertainties that could result in unfriendly scenarios for markets. Luca Jellinek, head of European Rates Strategy at French investment bank Crédit Agricole, suggests that the worst case scenario going forward is also most likely. The flow chart below, via eFXnews, looks at the odds of six different political scenarios unfolding and the outcome of each for the Italian bond market. The most likely scenario, of which there is a 25 percent chance, according to Jellinek, is that Italians go straight back to voting, and the second election produces another inconclusive result. Italian 10-year bond spreads widen to a painful 5 percent. Crédit AgricoleClick to enlarge

REUTERS/Andrew BurtonThis boy can still enjoy his Big Gulp on the streets of New York City after a judged struck down Mayor Michael Bloomberg's ban on sugary drinks over 16 ounces.A New York state judge struck down Mayor Bloomberg's controversial ban on large sodas on Monday, arguing that the restrictions on sugary sweetened drinks did not make sense, partly because the ban wasn't evenly enforced. The measure, approved by the New York City board of Health last September, banned the sale of sugary drinks larger than 16 ounces at New York City restaurants, street vendors, delis, and movie theaters.Â  The crackdown controversially did not apply to grocery stores or convenience stores. The opposition also took issue with other arbitrary components of the legislation. Why, for example were high-sugar, high-caloric drinks like milkshakes and alcoholic beverages allowed while sugary sweetened drinks like soda and lemonade were not? The judge also questioned the science behind the soda ban, which was crafted to curb obesity and obesity-related diseases like diabetes and heart disease in New York City. Bloomberg is unmoved. He maintains that the "best science" tells us there is relationship between sugary drinks and hefty New Yorkers. A presentation put together by Bloomberg's office last year attributes 5,800 deaths and $4 billion in medical costs in New York City to obesity. The leading cause of this obesity epidemic? Sugary drinks, they said. The city projected that if New Yorkers substituted a 16-ounce sugary drink for a 20-ounce sugary drink once every two weeks then we would "collectively save around 2.3 million pounds in one year." NYC.govThe link between sugary drinks and getting fat was further supported byÂ data released by the Mayor's office on Monday. The data showed thatÂ neighborhoods that consumed more sugary drinks had higher obesity and diabetes rates (see the charts on the right). Correlation, however, does not necessarily mean causation.Â For example, it's very likely that the kind of people who drink oversized sodas are also chowing down on greasy cheeseburgers, french fries and other junk foods. NYC.gov That's where New York HealthÂ Commissioner Thomas Farley points out that it's not just the calories and sugar in targeted drinks that make us gain weight. Size matters from a psychological standpoint, too. "People are beginning to recognize thatÂ sodaÂ is bad for you, that soda makes you gain weight, but it's tough for people to recognize that we are driven largely by the portions that are put in front of us," FarleyÂ said Wednesday on CNBC's "Squawk on the Street." Not only do we regulate our appetite based on the amount of food or drink placed in front of us, but we also blindly accept the beverage industry's sizes as a general guideline for how much we should consume. As studies have shown, the existence of a 40-ounce options makes people think that a 20-ounce size is reasonable. Eliminating that option, however, makes people more likely to view the 20 as extravagant and choose the 12-ounce instead.Â  Obesity is certainly a national health crisis, asÂ more than one-third of American adults are obese.Â While Bloomberg's initiative was poorly structured and unpopular, the real tragedy is that the obesity epidemic lives on.
The main reason the economy imploded in 2008 is that U.S. consumers finally collapsed under the weight of an unsustainable debt load that they had been building up for three decades. U.S. consumers drive about 70% of the spending in the U.S. economy, so when they maxed out, the economy tanked. When consumer spending tanked, meanwhile, corporations cut their own spending (translation: fired people), went into the fetal position, and just tried to survive. That one-two punch flattened the economy. Because the root cause of the problem was excessive consumer debt, there was no way the economy was going to recover until that debt--or at least the burden of that debt--was reduced. Well, the good news is that consumers have spent the last 5 years reducing the burden of that debt. Specifically, consumers have been defaulting, restructuring, refinancing, and/or paying down loans. This "deleveraging" is a painful process--not just for the consumers themselves (it's easier to accumulate debt than reduce it)--but for the businesses that depend on them. And, to be sure, many U.S. consumers still have more debt to reduce. But after 5 painful years, the debt burden of the average U.S. consumer is now in line with (or even below) its long-term trend. And that means that consumers can now devote a greater percentage of their income (and new borrowings) to spending again. Morgan Stanley economist Vincent Reinhart has put together an excellent presentation explaining why he thinks the U.S. economy is nearing an "inflection point," in which growth will finally accelerate. The presentation includes many compelling charts, so check it out here. The chart below is the most important one. After 5 years of pain, U.S. consumer debt service--the percent of disposable income that households must use to pay interest on their debts--has now fallen back to normal levels: Vincent Reinhart, Morgan Stanley So, now, on average, U.S. consumers can start borrowing and spending more again.

deltaMike/flickrDanish-based Lego just became the most valuable toymaker in the world, according to Bloomberg. The company is now worth $14.6 billion on an earnings before interest, taxes, deductions and amortization (EBITDA) basis.  The previous top toy producer, California-based Mattel, is valued at $14.4 billion. Revenue surged 25 percent last year, turning the three children of Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen, Denmark’s richest man -- Sofie, Thomas and Agnete, who hold a combined 37 percent economic interest in the company valued at more than $5.3 billion — into billionaires. “Lego is on fire,” Gerrick Johnson, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets in New York, told Bloomberg. “It’s the world’s biggest toymaker in terms of net income, operating income and Ebitda. It had a 71 percent gross margin in its latest results and is posting strong sales growth.” Click here to read how Lego turned their fortunes around &gt;
Reuters/ Lucas JacksonActivist investor manager Bill Ackman, the CEO of $12 billion Pershing Square Capital Management, has released a new presentation taking on Herbalife.Â  Late last year, Ackman publicly announced that he's shorting more than a 20 million shares of Herbalife, a multi-level marketing firm that sell nutrition products. The premise of his short thesis is that he believes the company is a pyramid scheme and that the government will be induced to investigate the company. Ackman has a price target of zero on his short. Â In other words, he thinks the company will fail. Taking the other side, a number of hedge fund managers have snapped up big long positions in Herbalife, most notably Daniel Loeb of Third Point and Ackman's long-time rival Carl Icahn.Â  Ackman's latest presentation compares Herbalife to Fortune Hi-Tech Marketing, a multi-level marketing company that was accused of operating as a pyramid scheme by the Federal Trade Commission and Attorneys General from Kentucky, North Carolina and Illinois. We've included his new slide deck "Side-by-Side: A Comparison of Fortune Hi-Tech Marketing and Herbalife" in the slides that follow. Â 
Flickr via topastrodfognaEarlier, we learned that initial jobless claims unexpectedly fell to 332k from 342k a week ago. This brought the 4-week average down to a 5-year low. This is particularly impressive because it comes during the first full week of the sequestration budget cuts. Recently, the jobless claims report has been the target of criticism because of numbers from big states that often get estimated.  So you can bet the skeptics double-checked the report. However, today's number was clean. Here's TD Securities' Gennadiy Goldberg: Initial claims data sharply surprised expectations, unexpectedly falling 10K to 332K and coming within 2K of the cycle low seen in mid-January. With the Labor Department citing no special factors for the decline, we are forced to take the initial claims print at face value as the 4wk MA falls to another fresh cycle low of 347K. It is worth noting that despite anecdotal evidence of government layoffs due to sequestration, initial claims have continued to come in lower, providing further evidence of improving labor market fundamentals. Seasonal adjustment factors were actually unsupportive for claims this week, so their outperformance here could be seen as evidence that the layoff side of the equation continues to improve quite notably. This continues the theme the the U.S. economy is indeed picking up in a big way.  And the best part is that jobs are coming back too.
They say it's darkest before dawn. That seems to be the attitude of BTIG analyst Walter Piecyk. This morning he upgraded Apple to a "buy," after being one of the first people to predict its troubles last year. In his buy note he does warn that Apple isn't safe yet. He writes, "Apple will soon report quarterly results which might not only miss its own guidance but could also include guidance for the upcoming June quarter that is $5 billion below consensus." Piecyk is the third analyst in the last week to warn Apple could whiff on its own guidance of $41-$43 billion in revenue. Citi and Jefferies also floated it as a possibility. Basically, they all think iPhone and iPad sales are going to be lighter than expected.  If Apple missed its own guidance it would be a disaster for the stock. It would make management look incompetent. Piecyk is the first we've seen to warn about terrible June guidance. If that happens, it could hammer the stock. But! Once all of that happens, he's bullish the stock rebounds all the way to $540.

The figure ticked an astonishing 57.8 percent among Greek youth.Â  Negotiations between Greek leaders and the EU-IMF-ECB "troika" have ground to a halt as lingering disagreements over federalÂ job cuts, VAT levels and property taxes put off a scheduled meeting for the second consecutive week, according to I Kathimerini.Â 
The bonus situation at Swiss banking giant UBS doesn't sound pretty this year... The New York Post's Mark DeCambre reports that about 25 percent of UBS's top managers in the investment bank will receive no bonus this year. Nothing. Meanwhile, UBS's investment bank head, Andrea Orcel, was just granted $26 million in deferred compensation and shares, Dealbook's Julia Werdigier reported. The reason he's getting that much has to do with benefits he forfeited when he joined UBS from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. He spent 20 years at Merrill. UBS's CEO Sergio Ermotti was paid about $9.3 million in comp for 2012. Back in October, UBS said that it would cut nearly 10,000 jobs worldwide. The bank is expected to release its annual report today. That should provide further details on compensation. 
BTIG analyst Walter Piecyk was one of the first people to turn bearish on Apple. This morning he's turning bullish. He's upgrading the stock to a "buy" and giving it a 12-month price target of $540. It closed at $428.35 yesterday. Piecyk says he believes Apple will have EPS growth in 2014. This year EPS will be flat, or even possibly down. He bases the potential growth on four factors: Apple will release a cheaper iPhone, carrier upgrade policies will make it easier for users to buy new iPhones, a new product will come out, and Apple will do something with its cash. However, he also warns that Apple could miss analysts expectations this quarter, and might even miss its own guidance. That could crater the stock below $400 a share. But after that, he sees things smoothing out and improving for Apple. In April of last year he predicted Apple was going to have a bad fiscal third quarter with revenue missing expectations on light iPhone sales. He rated the stock "neutral." He was right: iPhone sales were light and revenue missed. Apple's stock still rose after that miss, but it peaked and has fallen 40 percent since. While Apple's stock has fallen, other analysts have rushed to downgrade the stock and slash their price targets. Piecyk thinks now is the time to buy. Here are the bullet points of Piecyk's buy call:

GENEVA (AP) — The search is all but over for a subatomic particle that is a crucial building block of the universe. Physicists announced Thursday they believe they have discovered the subatomic particle predicted nearly a half-century ago, which will go a long way toward explaining what gives electrons and all matter in the universe size and shape. The elusive particle, called a Higgs boson, was predicted in 1964 to help fill in our understanding of the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the Big Bang. The particle was named for Peter Higgs, one of the physicists who proposed its existence, but it later became popularly known as the "God particle." The discovery would be a strong contender for the Nobel Prize. Last July, scientists at the European Organization for Nuclear Research, or CERN, announced finding a particle they described as Higgs-like, but they stopped short of saying conclusively that it was the same particle or was some version of it. Scientists have now finished going through the entire set of data. "The preliminary results with the full 2012 data set are magnificent and to me it is clear that we are dealing with a Higgs boson, though we still have a long way to go to know what kind of Higgs boson it is," said Joe Incandela, a physicist who heads one of the two main teams at CERN, each involving several thousand scientists. Whether or not it is a Higgs boson is demonstrated by how it interacts with other particles and its quantum properties, CERN said in the statement. After checking, scientists said the data "strongly indicates that it is a Higgs boson." The results were announced in a statement by the Geneva-based CERN and released at a physics conference in the Italian Alps. CERN's atom smasher, the $10 billion Large Hadron Collider that lies beneath the Swiss-French border, has been creating high-energy collisions of protons to investigate how the universe came to be the way it is. The particle's existence helps confirm the theory that objects gain their size and shape when particles interact in an energy field with a key particle, the Higgs boson. The more they attract, so the theory goes, the bigger their mass will be. Copyright (2013) Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The latest weekly reading of initial jobless claims is out. Claims unexpectedly fell to 332k from 342k a week ago. Economists expected claims to rise slightly to 350k. Last week's claims were revised up slightly from 340k. The 4-week moving average has now fallen to 346k, down from 349k a week ago. Calculated Risk's Bill McBride notes this is the lowest level since March 2008. This is particularly surprising considering that the sequestration budget cuts began on March 1.Â  The current jobless claims report cover the week ending March 9. "The largest increases in initial claims for the week ending March 2 were in California (+11,720), New York (+7,900), Missouri (+2,722), Kansas (+1,419), and Washington (+813), while the largest decreases were in Massachusetts (-4,193), North Carolina (-1,146), Connecticut (-913), Michigan (-909), and Florida (-726)," wrote the Department of Labor.

ReutersFebruary foreclosure filings increased two percent month-over-month (MoM) in February, according to the latest foreclosure report from RealtyTrac. These include default notices, auctions, and real estate owned (REOs) properties. But filings were down 25 percent from a year ago. One in every 849 homes received a foreclosure filing in February, down from a foreclosure rate of one in every 869 homes the previous month. "The U.S. foreclosure inferno has been effectively contained," according to Daren Blomquist, vice president at RealtyTrac. "But dangerous foreclosure flare-ups are still popping up in states where foreclosures have been delayed by a lengthy court process or by new legislation making it more difficult to foreclose outside of the court system." Foreclosure flare-ups In Washington for instance, foreclosure activity was up for the 10th straight month, rising two percent MoM, and up 123 percent from a year ago. It now has the nation's fifth-highest foreclosure rate, for the first time since RealtyTrac began reporting on foreclosures in 2005. Maine saw an over 400 percent year-over-year (YoY) surge in foreclosure activity. Meanwhile, Maryland's foreclosure activity was up for the eighth straight month, rising 105 percent on the year and 49 percent on the month. RealtyTracAnd the rise in Maryland's foreclosure activity was driven by a 319 percent jump in foreclosure starts – the pace at which mortgages enter the foreclosure process. Overall, foreclosure starts were up 10 percent in February, rising for the first time in three months. They were however down 25 percent YoY. Rising foreclosure starts are cause for concern, because the decline in inventory supported home prices, and in large part helped drive the housing recovery. Housing analysts have been revising up their 2013 home price forecasts, with Bank of America Merill Lynch and Capital Economics calling for an eight percent rise in home prices. For now, Florida, Nevada and Illinois continue to have the nation's highest foreclosure rates.

Werner Kunz / FlickrRecent economic data have been overwhelmingly positive in the U.S., and it has forced several economists to crank up their GDP growth forecasts this week. Today, we'll get reads on inflation and jobs, both of which are measure that the Federal Reserve is employing to guide monetary policy. Here's preview from Calculated Risk's Bill McBride:
How can financial markets be "efficient" when they just crashed and took our economy down with them? And when sensible people like Bob Shiller, Nouriel Roubini, Bill McBride, et al. were screaming their heads off about a housing bubble years before the pop? Of course I have some sympathy for these complaints. But the more I learn about and teach finance, the more I learn what an important and useful idea the "EMH" in fact is. I don't want to say that the EMH is unfairly maligned, but I do think that its vast usefulness is usually ignored in the press. First of all, people should realize that the EMH is misnamed—it's not really a hypothesis, it's not about "efficiency" in the economic sense of the word, and it's not unique (so it shouldn't have a "the" in front of it). Some of this miswording was just semantic clumsiness on the part of the people who came up with the theory. Some was sloppy science. The "efficient" part of "EMH" doesn't mean that financial markets lead to a Pareto-efficient outcome. You could have externalties—for example, every time you make a financial transaction, God might kill a kitten—and the market could still be "efficient" in the way that financial economists use the term. Similarly, a vastly "inefficient" financial market might be Pareto efficient, since it might only be possible to make profits by taking advantage of someone else's stupidity. The "efficient" actually just refers to information-processing efficiency. What that basically means is that if there's some piece of information out there - some fact about a company's balance sheets, or some pattern in past prices, etc. - the market price should reflect that piece of information. That's what "efficient" means here. But exactly how should prices reflect information? Here's the bigger problem with the term "EMH" (the "sloppy science" part)—it's not really a hypothesis. How prices reflect information will always depend on people's preferences. In finance, preferences include preferences about risk. So without a measure of risk, it's impossible to scientifically test whether or not prices incorporate information. To be a real hypothesis, the EMH needs to be paired with a specification of risk (or, more generally, a hypothesis about people's preferences with respect to uncertainty and time, and a hypothesis about the sources of risk). And since there are many possible such specifications, there isn't just one "EMH"...there are infinite. To complicate things, "the EMH" says nothing about how long it takes for the market to process information. So even if an EMH happens to be true at one frequency (say, daily), it might not be true at the 1-second frequency. OK, so is even one of these EMHs true, at some frequency? We can do statistical tests, but we'll never really know. First of all, our tests are all pretty weak. But more importantly, conditions may change! An EMH might be true for a while, and we might conclude it's true, and then things might change and for one or two years it might stop being true, and then we'd do some more statistical tests and say "Oh wait, I guess it's not true after all!", and then it might go right back to being true! We generally assume the laws of physics don't change from year to year, but it's easy to imagine that the "laws" of finance aren't as immutable. What if the market is "efficient" 99% of the time, and the rest of the time there's a catastrophic bubble?  And to top it all off, theory says that the strong form of the EMH can't even be true. So "the EMH" is very limited as a scientific hypothesis or physics-like law of nature. And I think that ever since many of these points were pointed out (I think by Andrew Lo, though someone else may have preceded him), financial economists have stopped talking about "the EMH" as such, except in a vague hand-wavy way during informal discussions. Sloppiness has been much reduced. But I do seem to recall that the title of this post was "In defense of the EMH". So I had better get around to defending it! What I want to defend is the idea behind the EMH. Even if the data rejected every single EMH, the idea would still be incredibly useful for the average person.  Let's call this idea the Random Markets Idea, or RMI. The simplest form of the RMI was stated by Paul Samuelson in 1965: "Properly anticipated prices fluctuate randomly." Basically, if it was pretty easy to see where prices were headed, a lot of people would see it, and try to make free money by trading on it. Since people in the finance industry are doing a lot of work—watching the news like a hawk, doing constant analysis of changing numbers—chances are that the price change will happen so fast that you won't have time to get in on the action. So from the perspective of any of us who doesn't have a supercomputer in his head, prices movements must be unpredictable and surprising. They must seem random.  That's it. That's the RMI. Note that this is very different than saying, "On average, people don't beat the market average." This is more than that. This is saying that even if you manage to beat the market average for a year or two years or even ten years, you shouldn't expect to be able to repeat your performance next year.   That may seem counterintuitive, or even silly. "Hey," you think, "I beat the market last year, so I must be one of the smart guys! And that means I should be able to repeat my performance...right?" Well, maybe. But the RMI says that that's actually very, very unlikely. It's far more likely that you just got lucky. Now here we get to why the RMI is so useful to you and me and most people (and to the managers of our pension funds and mutual funds). It provides a check on our behavioral biases. Probably the most robust findings in the field of behavioral finance is that individual investors do badly. They are overconfident. They trade too much and take losses on trading costs. They suffer from biases like disposition effect, probability mis-weighting, recency bias, etc. And as a result they lose money, relative to the wise folks who just stick their money in a low-cost diversified portfolio and watch it grow. As for institutional investors - mutual fund managers and pension fund managers - we don't know as much about what they do, but we do know that very few of them manage to consistently beat the market, year after year (and most don't beat the market at all). It's interesting to note that people usually think of behavioral finance as being an alternative to efficient-markets theory. And sometimes it is! But in the case of personal investing - i.e., the single most important way that you will probably participate in financial markets—the two ideas support each other. The RMI says "You can't beat the market;" behavioral finance says "But you're probably going to lose your money trying."  Of course, even the RMI isn't quite true. There are some people—a very few—who correctly guess price movements, and make money year after year after year (I work with a couple). But you're very unlikely to be one of those people. And your behavioral biases—your self-attribution bias, overconfidence, and optimism—are constantly trying to trick you into thinking you're one of the lucky few, even when you're not.  The RMI is an antidote to this! Just remind yourself that market movements should be really, really tough to predict. Then, when you start to think "It's so so so obvious, why can't people see AAPL is headed for $900, I'm gonna trade and get rich!", you'll realize that no, it can't be that obvious. And you'll restrain your itchy trigger finger. And when you start to think "My money manager is awesome, he beat the market the last 5 years running, I'll pay his hefty fee and he'll make me rich!", you'll stop and realize that no, it was probably luck. And you'll think about putting your money in index funds, ETFs, and other low-cost products instead. In general, the RMI focuses your brain on assessing risks instead of trying to outguess the market. This is important, because risk is a difficult thing to think about, while making bets and guesses about returns is relatively easy. But in the real world, most of your portfolio's return will be determined not by how well you make bets and guesses, but by the riskiness of the asset classes in which you choose to invest (stocks, bonds, etc.). Most of the return you get, in the long run, will come from taking risk. But because risk is a cost (imagine if you have an emergency and need to withdraw your money while the market is down!), you need to carefully balance your desire for return with your tolerance of risk. This is what the RMI helps you think about. OK, let's step back a second. Why do we put our trust in any scientific theory? Well, because it's useful. We know Newton's laws aren't exactly right, but we know they're very useful for landing a rocket on the moon, so when we land rockets on the moon we don't worry about the slight wrongness. And as for our most advanced theories—relativity, quantum mechanics, etc.—well, even those might just be approximations of some more general theory that we just haven't figured out yet. But in the meantime, we use what we've got if it's a good baseline approximation. The RMI—the general idea behind the various EMHs—is a good baseline for the personal investor (and probably for the pension fund manager too). It works pretty darn well. There are plenty of other areas in which market inefficiency/predictability may matter—financial regulation, corporate compensation, etc.—but you won't typically need to worry about those. You'll be better off treating the market as if it's more-or-less unpredictable and random. Addendum: It would be unfair not to point out that the RMI is also an important baseline, or jumping-off point, for most financial research. First of all, it leads to the idea that most of the observable factors that explain stock returns should be things that move many stocks at once (and thus can't be diversified). Second, it helped motivate the "limits to arbitrage" literature - if predictable market movements are due to "the market staying inefficient longer than you can stay solvent" (as a famous hedge fund manager-turned-economist once put it), that tells us that when we see things like bubbles, we should look for reasons why "smart money" investors like hedge funds can't stay solvent. Third, the RMI focused financial economists themselves on explaining risk. That has led to the observation and investigation of interesting phenomena like fat-tailed returns, clustered volatility, tail dependence, etc. Fourth, the fact that it's hard to beat the market raises the important question of why so many people try (and why so many people trick themselves into thinking they did, when they didn't). That investigation has led to much of behavioral finance itself. In other words, in science as in your personal investing life, the RMI serves as the fundamental baseline or jumping-off point. That doesn't mean it's the destination or the conclusion of financial economics. It isn't. But having a good baseline principle is extremely important in any science. You need to know where to start. Update: I wasn't going to write about this, but John Aziz in the comments made me unable to resist. What I actually think about the RMI (or "the EMH") is this: At any given moment, there are infinitely many models that describe financial markets better than the RMI. And at any given moment, there are a finite number of available, known models that describe financial markets better than the RMI. But all non-RMI-type models will stop working well shortly after they are discovered. In other words, if you had to pick one model of financial markets and stick to that model for a very long time, the RMI is the best one you could pick. So in some sense, the RMI is the closest you can get in financial markets to an exploitable, stable "law of nature" like the models we use in physics. For people who don't have time or skill to constantly search for new models, the RMI is best. I plan to make this idea the subject of another post in the future.

The first half of the interview, which aired yesterday, is dominated by a discussion of the natural resource constraints the world will be facing in the next decade. The real macro gems begin at 29:01 minutes in as Grantham discusses his ability to see market bubbles, which he attributes to nothing more than looking at “just the numbers.”  He also takes a refreshing long-term view of policy prescriptions noting there is no evidence that debt and low interest rates can affect long run GDP growth. He exhorts we need to focus more on real variables such education reform and productivity.  That is, structural reform.   Using monetary policy to temporary inflate the S&amp;P500 is another story, however. He notes that low interest rates are inflicting “great wounds” on retirees and transferring wealth from the poor to the rich, who, by the way, don’t spend  it. Money quotes: Economic theory doesn’t work with human beings.  We are far too messy.  (31:52) Bernanke has inherited a more completely academic view that markets are efficient. (32:38) That (Japan real estate bubble ) was the biggest bubble in history of the world… and right behind it was the Japanese stock market bubble. ..that went to 65 times earnings.   (32:50) Our long-term argument has nothing to do with the market…The U.S. market is not too bad [value] for the great franchise companies…the balance of the market is very expensive.  We assume profit margins.. will go back to…the trendline.  (40:10) Bernanke is whipping this donkey that can only grow at 1 percent, this economy, because he thinks it’s race horse that should be growing at 3.  So he is going to keep on whipping this donkey until it either drops dead or turns into a race horse, which is unlikely.  And I am betting on dead.  So it is a very unsafe situation to have the most powerful person in the economic world, by far, the chairman of the Fed. (44:24) There is no room…to believe that increasing debt has anything to do with long-term growth.  (47:01) By keeping interest rates low you are transferring money away from retirees who spend every penny and are really hurting, and, by the way, there is far more of them every year now than there ever was when economic theories were being panned out.   You take money from them and who are the beneficiaries?   The guys who run the hedge funds; and the banking system in general; and speculators; and corporations theoretically can use it to build. But they’re building less now than practically anytime in history.  There is no major capital spending boom going on.   (50:03) I’d rather stimulate the economy directly through government spending than I would like to play games with the monetary system and games with the interest rate, inflicting great wounds on retirees and so on…transferring wealth to people who won’t spend it.  We are transferring wealth from the poor to rich by keeping interest rate lows.   (52:20) In other words, the policies are the problem.    Good stuff.   Take the time or, at the very least, fast forward to minute 29 to get his macro views. By the way, we are huge fans of Charlie Rose but it’s clear in this interview he doesn’t understand macroeconomics. Click here full interview. Read more posts on Global Macro Monitor »
The next major risk for investors is China's "colossal credit bubble," Marc Faber, editor and publisher of The Gloom, Boom &amp; Doom Report told CNBC on Thursday. Many investors turned bearish on the world's second largest economy last year after China clocked some of its lowest growth numbers in more than a decade, but a rebound in the final quarter that coincided with the announcement of the new leadership changed that mood. An evidence of that change in sentiment was the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index that rallied close to15 percent in December. But Faber warns that a mounting credit bubble in China remained a crucial risk for investors in the Asian powerhouse. (Read More: Less Is More: The Message China Must Heed) "Whether they [Chinese government] can ensure continuous growth will depend on reforms and how to deflate the colossal credit bubble we have in China. This is going to be a huge problem because we have so much underground credit, questionable loans outstanding and questionable investments," he said. Western rating agencies have warned that a rapid rise in off-balance-sheet banking activity is a threat to China's financial stability, the Financial Times has reported. (Read More: China's Brokerages Turn Shadow Banks) Faber's concerns also echo a warning from the World Bank in December, which argued that China faces the risk of a return to overheating, as loose monetary policies in Western economies trigger a flood of capital into the region, potentially leading to asset bubbles and excessive credit growth. (Read More: Beware 'Credit Supernova' Looming Ahead : Gross) China's recent strong export numbers, which blew past market expectations, were also a cause for concern for Faber. China's export data for February showed a 21.8 percent year on year spike, in contrast to analyst expectations of 10.1 percent. However, the reliability of this data has been questioned due to its inconsistency with neighboring countries' data including South Korea and Taiwan, among other things. (Read More: Three Reasons to Doubt China's Export Numbers) Faber said he expected China's economic growth to be much lower in reality, and even hinted towards a recession in some sectors of the economy. "I think the economy has slowed down a lot...but they will not miss their 7.5 percent target, they will announce it, but the reality will be much lower. If you look at the statistics that are more reliable like Korean, Japanese or Taiwanese exports... then export figures from China don't add up entirely," he said. "The economy in China will slow down and we may even have in certain sectors a recession... The question is about the future. I think China will still grow but there will be bumps along the road and political issues," he added. China's economy grew 7.8 percent in 2012. The Chinese government has set a growth target for 7.5 percent for 2013, though most analysts foresee China overshooting that target and growing at around 8 percent.

A friend asked me to put together a presentation on our energy predicament. I am not certain all of the charts in this post will go into it, but I thought others might be interested in a not-so-difficult version of the story of the energy predicament we are reaching. My friend also asked what characteristics a new fuel would need to have to solve our energy predicament. Because of this, I have included a section at the end on this subject, rather than the traditional, “How do we respond?” section. Given the timing involved, and the combination of limits we are reaching, it is not clear that a fuel suitable for mitigation is really feasible, however. Increased energy use is associated with increasing prosperity. Gail TverbergWorld growth in energy use, oil use, and GDP (three-year averages). Oil and energy use based on BP’s 2012 Statistical Review of World Energy. GDP growth based on USDA Economic Research data.  Energy use and oil use have risen more or less in tandem with GDP increases. Oil is expensive and in short supply, so its increases have tended to be somewhat smaller than total energy increases. This happens because businesses are constantly seeking ways to substitute away from oil use. Gail TverbergChina’s energy consumption by source, based on BP’s Statistical Review of World Energy data.  China is an example of a country with very high growth in energy use. China’s energy use started growing rapidly immediately after it joined the World Trade Organization in December 2001. China’s energy use is mostly coal. Gail TverbergPer capita oil consumption in countries with recent bank bailouts, based on data of the US Energy Information Administration.  European countries with bank bailouts show declining oil consumption. Increased fuel use is also associated with rising population growth.  Gail TverbergWorld population from US Census Bureau, overlaid with fossil fuel use (red) by Vaclav Smil from Energy Transitions: History, Requirements, Prospects.  On Figure 6 above, the fuel use and population growth rise very rapidly, after fossil fuels were added about 1800. In fact, the lines overlay each other, so it is not possible to see both. Adding fossil fuels allowed much better food supply, sanitation, and medical care, all leading to huge population growth. Gail TverbergWorld Population 1860 to 2011, based on EIA data.  World population is still growing rapidly, especially outside of the developed countries. The countries with the most population growth (blue) are only now beginning to obtain goods and services that the developed world takes for granted, like better medical services, cars, and electricity for every home. Their fuel use is growing rapidly. One factor that limits fuel switching from oil to electricity is the amount of machinery currently using oil.  Robert Hirsch says  Worldwide machinery operating on oil is valued at $50 to $100 trillion (Automobiles, airplanes, tractors, trucks, ships, buses, etc.) There is also a huge investment in roads, bridges, refineries, and pipelines. Past transitions have taken more than 30 years, because it usually makes economic sense to wait for current machinery to reach the end of its economic life before replacing it. Unfortunately, we live in a finite world. At some point we start reaching limits. Gail TverbergHumans at this point are winning the competition with other species for resources.  One limit we are reaching is how many people the world will support, without unduly affecting other species. There are now over 7 billion humans on earth, compared to fewer than 200,000 gorillas and chimpanzees, which are also primates. The natural order is set up so that each species–including humans–reproduces in far greater numbers than is needed to replace itself. Natural selection chooses which of the many organisms will survive. With the benefit of fossil fuel energy, humans (as well as their cows, pigs, goats, chickens, dogs and cats) have been able to survive in far greater numbers than other species. In fact, paleobiologists tell us that the Sixth Mass Extinction has begun, thanks to humans. At some point, interdependencies are disturbed, and we can expect more population collapses. Gail TverbergAir pollution in Taiwan, from Wikipedia.  Another limit is pollution of many types. This image is of air pollution, but there is also water pollution and CO2 pollution. Even what we think of as renewable energy often poses pollution challenges. For example, battery recycling/disposal can pose pollution challenges. Mining of rare earth minerals, used in electric cars, wind turbines, and many high tech devices is often cited as being very polluting in China. Another limit is declining soil quality. In the natural order, soil is not disturbed by plowing, and the nutrients animals use are recycled back into the soil, after they use them. As we disturb this natural order, we find erosion reduces top-soil depth. The amount of organic matter in the soil is reduced, making crops less drought-resistant. Nutrients such as phosphorous and potassium are often depleted, and need to be added as soil amendments, requiring fossil fuel transport. Soils often suffer from salinity related to irrigation. Nitrogen levels also become depleted. It is possible to mitigate these problems using fossil fuels. However, we discover that our ability to feed 7 billion people becomes increasingly dependent on continued fossil fuel use. If we increase biofuel production, this tends to make the situation worse. Techniques such as regrading of hills to improve rainwater absorption can help the situation, but this too requires energy. Another limit is imposed by the Second Law of Thermodynamics.  Entropy happens. Things fall apart. All of the “stuff” humans have produced (including roads, bridges, pipelines, electricity transmission equipment, cars, and computers) keeps degrading, and eventually needs to be replaced. If we intend to continue to have roads, we need to keep repairing them and building new ones. Using current technology, this requires an increasing amount of fossil fuel energy. Gail TverbergDeclining resource quality image by author.  Another limit arises because we extract the cheapest, easiest to extract resources first. As a result, at some point, the cost of extraction rises, because the cheap resources have already been depleted. Outside observers don’t necessarily notice a difference as the quality of resources drops over time; it always looks as if there is an increasing quantity of reserves available as we move down the resource triangle. Unfortunately, the apparently increased resources are not really comparable to what was already extracted. The resources lower down in the resource triangle, such as oil and gas that requires “fracking” to extract, require the use of increased energy resources. The speed of extraction is often remarkably slower–light oil flows like milk, while heavy oil can be the consistency of peanut butter. Extracting oil using fracking has been compared to getting oil from the pores of a concrete driveway. Another example is fresh water. Initially we take it from a local stream, or from a shallow well, where little energy (and cost) is required to obtain it. As this resource depletes, we  seek other sources–deeper wells, or water piped from afar, or desalination. All of these approaches use much more energy. If the world’s total energy supply is not growing rapidly, using more energy for water supply is likely to mean less energy is available for other uses. I discuss this issue in Our Investment Sinkhole Problem. Gail TverbergUS crude oil production, based on EIA data. 2012 data estimated based on partial year data. Tight oil split is author’s estimate based on state distribution of oil supply increases.  An example of how resource depletion can work is illustrated with US oil supply. US oil production (blue) suddenly began to decline in 1970, despite the oil industry’s best efforts to extract more. By scrambling around quickly, it was possible to add more oil production from Alaska (red), but this soon declined as well. It wasn’t until oil prices rose in the late 2000s that it made economic sense to use technology which had been developed much earlier to extract tight oil. Tight oil is expensive oil to extract. How much production will rise from current levels depends to a significant extent on how much oil prices are able to increase in the future. The higher that oil prices rise, the greater the recessionary impact that can be expected, but the more oil that can be produced. Gail TverbergWorld crude oil production based on EIA data. *2012 estimated based on data through October.  World oil supply is now about level, except for the small increase added by US and Canadian oil supply. (Figure 13) One concern with world oil supply as flat as it is, is that at some point, world oil supply will suddenly take a nosedive, just as US oil production did. Gail TverbergOil consumption by area, based on BP’s 2012 Statistical Report. FSU is Former Soviet Union.  Another concern is that the developing world will get the majority of the world oil supply, leaving little for historically large users (Figure 13). US, Europe, and Japan experienced severe recession in the 2007-2009 period, and still are seeing economic headwinds, at the same time that countries that were able to obtain the oil continued to experience economic growth. I think of our current situation as being like that of a host who gives a party for 10 people. There is enough food to go around, but just barely. The host decides to invite another 50 people to the party. Surprise! Suddenly there is a shortfall. Globalization has its downside! Gail TverbergWorld oil supply and price, both based on BP’s 2012 Statistical Review of World Energy data. Updates to 2012$ added based on EIA price and supply data and BLS CPI urban.  A third concern is that oil prices will disrupt economies of oil importing nations. Oil prices rose sharply after US oil production dropped in the 1970s. They began rising rapidly again about 2003, as the world became more globalized. In addition, oil resources became increasingly expensive to extract. There is little possibility now that oil prices can decline for long without a drop in oil production. Oil price spikes lead to recession. Economist James Hamilton has shown that ten out of the most recent 11 US recession were associated with oil price spikes. When oil prices rise, food prices tend to rise at the same time. Consumers cut back on discretionary spending, because fuel for commuting and the price of food are necessities. This cutback in spending leads to layoffs in the discretionary sector and recession. Gail Tverberg High oil prices are associated with depressed wages. Oil price through 2011 from BP’s 2012 Statistical Review of World Energy, updated to 2012 using EIA data and CPI-Urban from BLS. Average wages calculated by dividing Private Industry wages from US BEA Table 2.1 by US population, and bringing to 2012 cost level using CPI-Urban.  High oil prices also seem to lead to depressed wages.  (Figure 15. Here, I am dividing total wages for all non-government employees or by the total US population, and then taking this average wage, and adjusting if for inflation.) This is the effect we would expect, if the major substitution caused by high oil prices is a loss of human employment. This shift tends to occur because human energy is very expensive, and because wages tend to be a big share of a company’s costs. Gail TverbergIllustration by author of ways oil price rise could squeeze wages. Amounts illustrative, not based on averages.  This figure shows an illustration of the effect that happens. If oil prices rise, the cost of making goods and transporting them to their destination rises. If the sales prices of goods doesn’t rise, a business’ profits will shrink. (Before and after the oil price rise shown in black box). The company will consider low profits unacceptable. The company has several ways of fixing its lower profit. Wages tend to be one of the company’s largest costs, so these are a likely target. One approach is automation. This may slightly raise electricity costs, but it will lower wage costs, and raise profits. Another approach is outsourcing production to a low-cost country like China. This will lower wage costs and probably other costs, leading to higher profit for the company. A third approach is what I call “making a smaller batch.” It involves closing unprofitable offices, or flying fewer jets, so that the quantity produced matches the new lower demand for the product, given the higher required sales’ price, now that the oil price is higher. Any of these approaches reduces the amount of wages paid to US employees. HOW DOES THIS CONCLUDE? A person could argue that any of the limits could eventually bring the system down. The pressure on wages is particularly a problem, since a further rise in oil prices would seem likely to lead to more job loss, and further pressure on wages of those who keep their jobs. The large amount of debt outstanding is another issue of concern. Gail TverbergAuthor’s view of how various limits might work together to produce different symptoms.  My personal view is that the most likely scenario is that the various limits will work together to produce secondary effects, and it is the secondary effects that are likely to bring society down. These secondary effects are Financial (wealth disparity, debt defaults, inability to collect enough taxes), Political (not enough taxes, uprising by the lower classes, government collapse) and Disease Susceptibility (inadequate food, medicine, and sanitation due to inadequate wages and government cutbacks). These effects are similar to ones experienced in the past when economies started reaching resource limits, based on the research of Peter Turchin and Sergey Nefedov reported in the book Secular Cycles. In the past, societies seemed to go through about 300 year cycles. The first was Growth, lasting over 100 years. The second was Stagflation, lasting perhaps 50 or 60 years. This third was Crisis, with population decline, lasting up to 50 years (but perhaps a much shorter time). The fourth was Depression/ Intercycle. If we estimate that today’s complete cycle started in 1800 with the use of coal, and the Stagflation period started about 1970 with the decline in US oil production, then we now seem to be nearing the Crisis stage. Of course, each situation is different. This is the first time we are reaching resource limits on a world-wide basis. Gail TverbergGovernment receipts divided by private industry wages, and government expenditures divided by private industry wage, based on BEA data.  There is considerable evidence that we are already reaching the situation where governments are encountering financial distress of the type shown in Figure 17. With wages being depressing in recent years (Figure 15), it is difficult to collect as much taxes as required. At the same time, expenses are elevated to handle the many issues that arise (such as payments to the unemployed, subsidies for alternative energy, and the higher costs of road repairs due to higher asphalt costs). The big gap between revenue and expense makes it hard to fix our current financial predicament, and increases the likelihood of political problems. Is it possible to fix our current situation? To really fix the situation, we would need to reproduce the situation we had in the post-World War II period–when energy was cheap, and growing very rapidly. Economists have observed that historically, the cost of energy was very low. Given the importance of energy, its low price was an important feature, not a bug.  It is what allowed society to have plenty of energy for growth, at minimal cost. In order for a new alternative fuel to truly fix our current predicament, it would need the following characteristics: It is interesting that when M. King Hubbert originally made his forecast of the decline of fossil fuels, he made his forecast as if an alternative fuel would become available in huge quantity, by the time of the decline. His original idea (in 1956) was that the new fuel would be nuclear. By 1976, his view was that the new fuel needed to be some version of solar energy. What kind of solar energy might this be? Solar panels PV located on the ground are heavy users of resources, because they have a low capacity factor (percentage of the time they are actually collecting sunlight), and because they need to be fairly sturdy, to withstand wind, rain, and hail. Space solar theoretically would be much better, because it is much more sparing in its use of resources–it would have over a 99% capacity factor, and the PV film could be much thinner. Timing for space solar would be a big issue, however, assuming financial issues can be worked out. Also, even if space solar or some other fuel should provide the fuel characteristics we need, we still need to address the population issue. As long as world population keeps rising,  humans are an increasing strain on earth’s resources.

REUTERS/StringerOver the past few days, China has been pulling thousands of dead pigs out of Shanghai's Huangpu river. Bloomberg reports that a farm in the Zhejiang province has finally claimed responsibility. The horrifying images were only made worse by the fact that the river is a source of drinking water for the locals. "One merchant claims that a crackdown on the sale of dead pigs forced pig farmers to dump them into the river," said Bill Bishop in his Sinocism newsletter.Â  "So the good news may be that fewer dead pigs are getting into the food supply, but the bad news is that it used to be very common? Regardless, another reason, if you need one, to avoid processed pork in China."

Guang Niu/Getty ImagesAmid the National People's Congress, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) held a press conference in which it said, "monetary policy will stay prudent and neutral in 2013," according to Xinhua. China's official inflation target had been set at 3.5 percent, and the target for growth of broad money supply (M2) was being lowered to 13 percent. This month inflation reached a 10-month high of 3.2 percent, driven by food prices. While analysts and the PBoC said this was largely because of the impact of the Lunar New Year holiday, they are keeping an eye on inflation. PBOC Governor Zhou Xiaochuan said China should be on "high alert for inflation," according to Xinhua. He said monetary policy should be influenced by inflation and not the price of assets like real estate. Zhou also said the high M2 is because of the nation's high savings rate which impacts the financial sector because higher savings allow banks to lend more. Bank of America's Ting Lu wrote that Zhou seemed "more hawkish on monetary stance than before," but that this could be "a consequence of being criticized by the public for carrying out overly loose monetary policy since late 2008." But the PBoC and the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), China's influential planning agency in control of economic policies, have been at odds with one another, according to a Reuters report. The NDRC is pushing hard for economic growth, which limits the central bank's ability to influence monetaryÂ  policy. And Wang Jun, senior economist at the China Centre for International Economic Exchanges (CCIEE) told Reuters that the focus will continue to be on "stabilizing growth" not "controlling inflation." But it seems too early to say which way the decision will go. From Reuters: "The central bank has gained more clout under the governorship of Zhou Xiaochuan, who has pursued a programme of market-based reforms. But its lack of policy independence means it needs cabinet approval to adjust benchmark interest rates or the value of the yuan. "Its reforms though have allowed it to keep a reasonably tight rein on liquidity in the financial system - and the availability of funds banks have to lend - despite calls from China's provinces for aggressive monetary easing to support growth. "While those supporting economic growth have the upper hand, the policy debate could turn, the sources said." Meanwhile, Bloomberg is reporting that a survey of analysts showed that they expect China to loosen interest-rate controls this year and get rid of a cap on deposit rates. China made a move to liberalize its deposit rate last year, which SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale analyst Wei Yao said at the time, was a bigger move than the interest rate cut that accompanied it. This is because higher deposit rates would give the Chinese bigger returns and help increase spending. Zhou is expected to retain his title when government positions are announced on March 16, And he has said that the central bank's policies will "remain stable and continuous" irrespective of who is assigned the position.
