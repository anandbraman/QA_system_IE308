Earlier today we had a strong South Korean PMI report. The latest? Taiwan. It just saw a rise in December PMI from 47.4 to 50.6. From the report: 
With the House prepared to vote on the Senate fiscal cliff bill orchestrated by the White House and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, conservatives are railing against GOP House Speaker John Boehner for caving on the deal.Â  Here's the banner leading Drudge Report right now:Â  Drudge Report
Good news for the global economy. South Korea -- whose heavy reliance on global trade -- is seen by some economists as the "canary in the coalmine" just came in with a strong PMI report. From the report: The HSBC South Korea Purchasing Managersâ€™ IndexTM (PMIÂ®) â€“ a composite indicator designed to provide a single-figure snapshot of the health of the manufacturing sector â€“ registered 50.1 in December. That was an improvement on Novemberâ€™s 48.2 and the highest reading since May. However, being barely above 50.0, the PMI suggested that operating conditions were little changed since the previous month. Following six months of continuous decline new order volumes increased in the latest survey period. However, the rate of growth was only slight, with respondents commenting that underlying demand conditions remained fragile and economic conditions weak. This was particularly the case in export markets. New export orders fell during December for the seventh successive survey period. Markit
UPDATE: As the Fiscal Cliff bill gets closer to likely passage, the Aussie market (one of the few markets that's trading right now) is at its highs of the day.  Hong Kong is up over 1.2%. EARLIER: There are very few markets open (Japan/China on Holiday, futures still closed) but one that's open is Australia. And so far the Washington theatrics are not a problem. 
Taxes increased for almost all Americans at midnight last night. Since then, half of the American government, the Senate, approved a bill that would cut taxes for many of those Americans. The bill has been sent to the other half of the American government, the House of Representatives, so it can be signed into law. But Republicans in the House of Representatives are disgruntled about the Fiscal Cliff bill the Senate approved and are threatening not to approve it. The Senate bill calls for massive tax cuts for most Americans, including the investor and owner class (dividend taxes will be much lower under the Senate bill than they are under the law that took effect last night). This puts the Republicans in an odd position, considering that the party's primary mission is to cut taxes: Taxes have already gone up. So the Republicans are now the only thing standing between America and a gigantic tax cut. SEE ALSO: Great News For Romney Voters -- Congress Just Socked It To The 47%
The Senate has approved a tax deal to blunt some of the impact of the Fiscal Cliff. There's some great news for the investor and owner class in there: Dividend taxes won't go up anywhere near as much as they would have with no deal. And income taxes will only rise for households making a healthy $450,000 or more--and, even then, not very much (just back to the Clinton-era 39.6%). And there's other excellent news for those who regard America as a land of "makers" and "takers." Congress just socked it to Mitt Romney's famous 47%. Remember "the 47%"? They're the Americans who Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney said "don't take responsibility for themselves," because they make too little money to pay income taxes. (How dare they not make enough money to pay income taxes! How irresponsible and rude!) Of course, as many appalled Americans pointed out in the wake of Romney's remarks, most of these folks are either seniors collecting Social Security or working Americans who make less than ~$50,000 a year. And most of the latter folks pay payroll taxes and other taxes, like sales taxes. But these folks are still held in low regard by those who consider themselves America's makers. So there's great news for these folks tucked into the Senate bill: By not extending the payroll tax cuts, the Senate agreed to raise payroll taxes on working Americans from 4.2% to 6.2%--a tax that will apply to the first $113,000 of earned income. This tax increase will hit anyone who earns money in this country, including "the 47%." So, it's almost like Romney got elected! SEE ALSO: DEAR AMERICA: Here Are Your New Tax Rates
Just out from the CBO: A "score" of the Fiscal Cliff deal that the Senate voted on last night. You can find the score on the 2nd page of this embedded document. The bill adds nearly $4 trillion to the deficit over the next 10 years. Of course, this is against the baseline (which assumed the expiry of all tax cuts) so naturally undoing those tax increases was going to add a lot to the deficit. For the full text of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, see here. American Taxpayer Relief Act
Here's the only thing that most Americans care about: How much are your taxes going up or down. The Tax Policy Center has put out this table, showing how much your taxes will go down, relative to the baseline (meaning if Congress had done nothing and let the full cliff hit. We've highlighted the key table, which shows how much lower your Federal Tax Bill will be, relative to the baseline, presuming the House passes the Senate bill. The column under Average Federal Tax Changes shows the exact dollar amount that you'll pay less in 2013, than if the bill hadn't gone through, broken down by each income bracket. And yes, we know some will object to calling what was done a "tax cut" since for most people rates just stay the same, etc., but we're not trying to make a political point, just pointing out the difference between what you will pay and what you would have paid.

Venture capitalist Fred Wilson, of Union Square Ventures, has helped his firm post some of the best returns in the entire VC industry over the past five years. The firm's performance has been nothing short of spectacular, and Fred Wilson's reputation has justifiably soared. And yet, in 2012, even though USV had some amazing exits that coined money for the firm, its partners, and its clients, Wilson said in a recent blog post that he feels like it was a "shitty year." Why? Because Wilson did not make a single investment in 2012. In fact, Wilson has not made a single investment since the summer of 2011--more than 18 months ago. For a firm that has made dozens of investments over the last five years, and has been on a tremendous roll, that is highly unusual. Usually, when firms and investors get on a hot streak, the partners get giddier and more aggressive as the streak continues. They begin to feel like they're playing with "house money," boatloads of it, and they start throwing that money at whatever strikes their fancy. They also feel pressure to continue to justify their reputations (and fees), and keep the momentum going. So when they're not making investments, they feel like they're "doing nothing"--resting on laurels based on past accomplishments having nothing do to with what they are doing right now. And yet, for those who have been around long enough to understand the ebb and flow of investment cycles, it is clear that "doing nothing" is often the smartest investment decision of all. Every great investment opportunity goes through this investment cycle. In the beginning, when the opportunity is truly "speculative"--when most people think investing in the opportunity is obviously stupid--a few brave souls make brave bets and then cash in on extraordinary early returns. Then, everyone else sees those returns, and the money rushes in. Soon, all the investment money bids up prices and creates a wave of competitors vying for the same opportunity, and investment returns begin to drop. Eventually, the "fools" rush in, bidding prices up to truly silly levels, and dozens of competitors fight over the tiny crumbs of opportunity left on the table. Then returns collapse and the cycle ends. The consumer Internet cycle that drove Union Square Ventures' returns over the past 5-7 years began to wind down a year or two ago. So many investors had jumped into the game, so many companies were attacking the opportunity, and valuations had gotten so high that expected returns for small startups had begun to drop. There was massive excitement in the sector, of course--and huge "buzz" (in part because so many people were in the game)--but the fundamentals were no longer attractive. So the smartest investors began to scale back and look elsewhere. Or, in the case of Union Square, they just began to say "no." It's hard to imagine how many serious business plans and opportunities Union Square has said "no" to over the past 18 months. If I had to guess, I'd say it was on the order of 10 per day, or about 500 over the period. And that's just the serious ones. Saying "no" when the rest of the industry (and your competitors) are in a feeding frenzy is difficult. You often look and feel like an idiot. No matter how confident you are that the cycle has played out, you know that you might be wrong, and that you'll end up with your reputation in tatters, looking like a fool. So saying "no" is extremely hard to do. But, in investing, it's occasionally the smartest thing to do. So, even though Fred Wilson feels like he had a "shitty year" in 2012 because he didn't make any new investments, it's possible (likely, even) that he will end up having had a much better year than almost every other VC in the industry. In other words, Wilson may have demonstrated again that the performance Union Square has delivered over the past 5 years is no fluke and that he and his partners Brad Burnham and Albert Wenger deserve their reputations as one of the most talented investment teams in the industry.

It's assumed that the House will pass the Fiscal Cliff bill that the Senate passed last night, but until the last votes are taken, nothing is guaranteed. While liberals were seen as the huge source of concern yesterday, in the House, the big challenge is for Boehner to bring the votes. A lot of conservatives hate the bill. Tea Party representative Jason Chaffetz of Utah tweeted his opposition:  That partially echoes the sentiment of Marro Rubio, one of just 8 Senators who voted 'NO' last night. In a statement he said: â€œThousands of small businesses, not just the wealthy, will now be forced to decide how they'll pay this new tax and, chances are, they'll do it by firing employees, cutting back their hours and benefits, or postponing the new hire they were looking to make. And to make matters worse, it does nothing to bring our dangerous debt under control." And here's what Heritage Action said last night, when it urged politicians to vote NO. This kick-the-can approach, necessitated by a president who refuses to stop campaigning and start seriously addressing our nationâ€™s fiscal problems, is not an adequate solution to Americaâ€™s coming fiscal crisis, which is a result ofÂ overspending, not under-taxing.Â  Allowing a tax increase to hit a certain segment of Americans and small businesses is not a solution; when combined with the coming Obamacare tax increases, it all but ensures a weaker economy. ... Regardless of those provisions, it is clear that Washington continues to fail the American people.Â  America needs less spending, less taxing and less borrowing by our government, which would allow more investment and job-creation by Americaâ€™s private sector economy. To date, President Obama hasÂ proven to be fundamentally unseriousÂ about tackling our nationâ€™s coming fiscal crisis. Â America needs real leaders proposing real solutions, such as those found in Heritageâ€™sÂ Saving the American DreamÂ plan or even the previous House-passed budget.Â  This kick-the-can approach falls woefully short. Heritage Action opposes the kick-the-can tax increase and will include it as a key vote on our legislative scorecard. So basically, conservatives want spending cuts NOW, and this bill doesn't deliver. That being said, if the bill gets killed, taxes rise for everyone, and there's still no new spending cuts. 
Most of the attention around the Fiscal Cliff has been focused on income taxes. The way the deal went down, a tiny portion of American taxpayers â€” households that earn more than $450,000 per year â€” will see their income taxes rise modestly, from 35% to 39.6%. Everyone else's income taxes will stay the same. But that's not the whole story. By not addressing the payroll tax, the Fiscal Cliff deal will also result in a tax hike for all working Americans, including those in the middle and poor classes. All income up to $110,000 will now be socked with a 2 point increase in the payroll tax, from 4.2% to 6.2%, which will pluck $2,000 out of the pockets of families making $100,000 a year. Meanwhile, thanks to a deal on dividend taxes, the highest earning Americans have gotten a massive tax cut over the taxes that would have taken effect had a Fiscal Cliff deal not been agreed to. Dividend taxes for households making more than $450,000 per year will rise from 15% to 20% (plus an additional 3.8% surcharge for Obamacare, to a total of 23.8%). But they won't rise all the way to 39.6%, which they were scheduled to rise to without a Fiscal Cliff deal. Meanwhile, dividend taxes for those earning less than $450,000 a year will remain at 15% (18.8% with the surcharge, for those with income between $250,000 and $450,000). So the richest Americans have dodged a big tax bullet. Importantly, the dividend tax deal will disproportionately help the richest Americans: In other words, the tax deal that Congress just agreed to will raise $125 billion from increased payroll taxes from all working Americans (poor and middle class alike), while saving the richest Americans at least $20 billion in dividend taxes. Some of the folks who will save money on dividend taxes will obviously pay more on wage income, so there will be some balancing. But some won't. So, be happy this morning, rich Americans! This is a great deal for you! SEE ALSO: DEAR AMERICA: Here Are Your New Tax Rates
Assuming the House agrees to what the Senate voted on last night, then the Bush-era tax cuts will be made permanent for almost all Americans. Only those with incomes of $400K and up will see an income tax increase. But the other half of the Fiscal Cliff, the sequester (the mandatorys pending cuts agreed to in the debt ceiling fight) has only been delayed, giving DC more time to fight over it. That means we've already scheduled a new Fiscal Cliff, and the bill agreed to last night has the date: March 1, 2013 (exactly two months from today). This is from page 154 of the bill (HT: @jesse_livermore)  What will be interesting timing-wise is when the Treasury says we will hit the hard debt ceiling. The next two months will be non-stop debt ceiling/sequester, and it will all come to a head in late February/early March. For more on what's in the 157-page bill, see here &gt;
On January 1, just before 2 AM, the Senate overwhelmingly agreed to pass a bill that will avert the Fiscal Cliff. The House approved it later that night. The bill is pretty straightforward. Income tax rates will only rise on those making over $400K (liberals wanted $250K, GOP wanted no taxes to rise). Spending cuts will be delayed for 2 months to give the sides more time to address them. So why is the bill 157-pages long? Because when Washington does business and passes a huge bill, there are all kinds of little other pre-existing tax things most Americans have never heard of, but which needed to be extended, that also get into the bill. It's just how it works.       Some might think this is nefarious — that politicians see a huge bill and then sneak in all these random things. The reality is more like these have been around for a while, and every time a big bill comes up about taxes expiring, they get extended too. For the full text of the bill, see here &gt;
Brendan Hoffman/Getty ImagesToday the Fiscal Cliff debate moves to the House of Representatives. The Senate overwhelmingly passed the deal late last night (around 2 AM). While passage is expected in The House, there is A LOT of conservative frustration with the fact that A) taxes are going up B) basically nothing is done on the spending side. So there are a lot of folks hwo hate the bill. On the flipside, killing the bill by voting NO would be a political disaster. So what might happen? Citi's Steven Englander breaks down the three scenarios: 1)     A close vote before 6PM – Asian markets open up, catching up to the Monday S&amp;P move; S&amp;P futures probably have priced in most of the benefit of the fiscal cliff resolution. EUR CAD, and AUD have a bit of catching up to do with the S&amp;P, but there should be little drama  2)     A rancorous debate that extends into the night – again the key will be whether the votes are there, however, reluctantly, but if it looks as if support is waning we will see sharp moves in markets. With brinkmanship the new normal, the sell-off will be partial on the view that a last minute rabbit will be pulled from a hat.  3)     Amendments or rejection – markets will sell off sharply.  If it turns out that the House can’t vote ‘yes’ on an acceptable, yet inelegant fix, the confidence that has emerged in 11th hour fixes will dissipate and tail risk scenarios will shift into baseline outcomes. This would be USDJPY negative,  but risk-correlated currencies now price in 80-90% probably of a successful fix in our view, so the downside pressures will be large.

The Wall Street Journal has a big scare-story about analysts at big banks and their Facebook stock ratings. Despite the fact that Facebook's stock tanked once it hit the public markets, Wall Street analysts have largely issued "buy" recommendations for the stock. This is a problem, says the Journal because: What some see as the relentless "buy, buy, buy" optimism has deepened skepticism about the Wall Street stock-pitching machine. Critics say Facebook is a telling example of the divided loyalties at many firms, which woo lucrative investment-banking clients and then prod brokerage customers to buy the same stocks even if they look bruised. This is a very familiar, and very old story. But this time, it doesn't really ring true. You see, when the banks that underwrote Facebook's IPO started putting out their recommendations on the stock, they weren't exactly glowing. Morgan Stanley, for instance, had a price target of $38 on the stock in its first research report. The IPO price was $38. That means Morgan Stanley's analysts said any big institutional investor that bought the stock at $38 wasn't going to see a gain on the investment in the next twelve months. We're not exactly certain how this could be construed as some shady deal by Morgan Stanley to sucker people into buying Facebook stock. Other analysts with buy recommendations on Facebook also have price targets right around $38, which is an insult to the people that paid the IPO price. If there really was some grand conspiracy on the part of Facebook's bankers to push off Facebook stock, the price targets would be much higher. The Journal also seems to be unhappy that even as banks lowered their price targets by a few dollars they maintained their buy ratings. This is just how it goes with sell-side analysts. Look at Apple. The price targets went way up, and have come way down, but overall, it's still rated a "buy." Investors can't go on just buy or sell ratings. They need to read the reports and make up their minds. Also, maybe, just maybe, analysts actually think Facebook is going to go back to $40 a share. After all, it's a company with 1 billion users and a big opportunity to monetize its mobile application, something it hasn't yet done. It also has a chance to develop a new ad network. Big smart investors bought the stock at $38 a share for the IPO, which suggests they thought it was going to pop higher. This suggests that analysts who have twelve month price targets of $40 or more aren't all that crazy or engaged in some sort of side dealing. They just think the stock is currently undervalued.
Business InsiderWarren Buffett and (from left to right, photoshopped) Roy Welland, Ace Greenberg, Jimmy Cayne, Sylvia Moss, Steve Weinstein, and David EinhornPoker's rise to prominence in the world of finance has pushed bridge, its more mature predecessor, from the limelight. There's a reason, however, why the best bridge players in the country are almost all investors. Business Insider deputy editor and bridge enthusiast Gus Lubin notes: "Bridge is a complex card game that fits the analytic side of finance, as poker appeals to instincts." A bridge devotee, Warren Buffett has famously declared, "I wouldn't mind going to jail if I had three cellmates who played bridge." But passion for the game has gotten some on Wall Street in trouble. As recounted in William D. Cohan's House of Cards, Jimmy Cayne played a tournament of bridge while Bear Sterns imploded, an example of antipathy at the executive level that is often compared to Nero playing the fiddle while Rome burned. Though an intense mental activity, bridge also offers an opportunity to unwind for high-octane individuals. A 1955 issue of Sports Illustrated references Eisenhower's love for the game which was his "only effective form of relaxation...The most relaxing thing he could do was to play a game in which the problems were tough, the solutions difficult, but the consequences of error were just a few hundred harmless points written down on a scorepad." There's no doubt why investors still flock to this challenging test of teamwork, memory, and wits. Bridge can help your intelligence, your health, and your career â€” and it's fun.
We are 13 years into a secular bear market in the United States. The Nasdaq is still down 40% from its high, and the Dow and S&amp;P 500 are essentially flat. European and Japanese equities have generally fared worse.             The average secular bear market in the US has been about 11 years, with the shortest to date being four years and the longest 20. Are we at the beginning of a new bull market or another seven years of famine? What sorts of returns should we expect over the coming years from US equities?             Even if you have no investments in the stock market, this is an important question, in part because the pensions funded by state and local governments are heavily invested in US equities. In fact, they are often projecting returns in excess of 10% per year. How likely is that to happen? Who will make up the difference if it doesn’t? In nearly all states and jurisdictions, it is against the law to change the terms of a public pension plan once it is agreed upon.             Even more important to you personally, what will happen to your taxes if the secular bear persists? On this final day of 2012, let’s take a look at the potential returns of the stock market over the next 7-10 years. In previous Thoughts from the Frontline and in my book Bull’s Eye Investing, I have written that stock market returns are a function of valuations (typically, price-to-earnings ratios). Secular bull markets are periods of rising valuations, while secular bear markets are periods of falling valuations. While stock market returns can vary widely over one-year, ten-year, or twenty-year periods, over the long term stock market earnings have tended to correlate very highly with GDP and inflation.             Since GDP has tended to grow (at least until recently) at 3% per year, predicting long-term returns and secular bull and bear markets has been pretty straightforward. But recently several noteworthy analysts have presented research suggesting that GDP will not grow anywhere close to 3% over the coming decades. In today’s letter we look at the ramifications of slower GDP growth on equity returns. For most investors this is a very important topic, as the stock market tends to be the main driver of their investment returns.             At the beginning of the last decade I wrote that the US economy would be lucky to grow at 2% for the entire decade. Even though I was called a “big bad bear” at the time, it turns out that I was an optimist. The economy grew at 1.7%. When asked about the present decade a few years ago, I cautiously said that we would be lucky to grow at 2% for the decade, which elicited more bearish name-calling. Now I once again find myself to be more optimistic than some of my colleagues.             Last summer Bill Gross (chief investment officer of PIMCO) forecast that the US economy would grow at only 1.5% over the next decade. Recently, Jeremy Grantham of GMO (one of my investment heroes) wrote a paper called On the Road to Zero Growth, in which he forecast that “Going forward, GDP growth (conventionally measured) for the U.S. is likely to be about only 1.4% a year, and adjusted growth about 0.9%.”             Adding further to the sentiment, Dr. Robert Gordon, a very respected economist, wrote a paper for the National Bureau of Economic Research provocatively titled Is U.S. Economic Growth Over? Faltering Innovation Confronts the Six Headwinds. Quoting from the abstract: Even if innovation were to continue into the future at the rate of the two decades before 2007, the U.S. faces six headwinds that are in the process of dragging long-term growth to half or less of the 1.9 percent annual rate experienced between 1860 and 2007. These include demography, education, inequality, globalization, energy/environment, and the overhang of consumer and government debt. A provocative “exercise in subtraction” suggests that future growth in consumption per capita for the bottom 99 percent of the income distribution could fall below 0.5 percent per year for an extended period of decades.”             Even if Gordon does measure growth somewhat unconventionally, his is a very sobering forecast.             Finally, we have a paper called 1%... The New Normal Growth Rate? Authored by Chris Brightman of Research Affiliates (the firm founded by my friend Rob Arnott), it presents their view that 1% is the “new normal” growth rate. Chris follows up on research presented earlier, in which they described what they call the “3-D Hurricane” of deficits, debt, and demography.             My good friend (and no stranger to longtime readers of this letter) Ed Easterling of Crestmont Research (full bio at the end of this letter) and I were recently discussing these forecasts, finding humor in the fact that Grantham and Brightman, et al. were essentially calling Gross an optimist. But we definitely did not find anything funny about the implications of their forecasts on long-term stock market returns. We thereupon agreed to coauthor this letter, with the intention of helping you make your investment plans for the coming year. As we have done in the past, Ed wrote the first draft and I threw in a little editing and commenting, trying not to diminish the value of his research. And with that setup, let’s jump right in. (Note: All graphs and charts are his.)             As noted above, the longer-term assessments for GDP growth are turning decidedly lower than the long-term 3% we saw over the last century. Our purpose in this letter is to look beyond the details of each argument as to the prospects for growth. That is, our objective is to understand the long-term implications of growth for stock market returns. Whether your favorite economist foresees 2%, 1%, or 0% long-term growth, the outcome for returns is similar in direction: the impact will lie somewhere between bad and worse.             The following discussion includes excerpts from Ed’s book Probable Outcomes (and it’s one I highly recommend – John). It explores the possibility that future real economic growth may have downshifted from its historical trend of 3% – and more significantly, it highlights the implications of that shift.             Historically, the prospect of slower economic growth has not often been considered by economists and analysts, but it now looms large in mainstream thinking. The effects of slower growth on stock market returns will be dramatic for investors. Shifts &amp; Cycles             Most investors recognize that the stock market delivers extended periods of above-average and below-average returns. These periods are known as secular stock-market cycles. The last full secular bear was 1966-1981. The most recent secular bull ran from 1982-1999. Our current secular bear market started in 2000, and it still has a long way to go. Figure 1 presents all secular stock market periods since 1900. Figure 1. Secular Stock Market Cycles Mauldin            These secular periods are not the result of a random walk through good times and bad times. They are not periods of war or peace. They are not even alternating periods of recession and expansion in the economy. Rather, secular stock-market cycles are driven by changes in the overall value of the market. In other words, secular bull markets are periods when the price/earnings ratio (P/E) of the market rises and compounds returns, while secular bear markets are periods when P/E declines and compromises returns. The blue line near the bottom of Figure 1 shows the history of P/E. Rising P/E drives secular bulls (green-bar periods), and declining P/E drives secular bears (red-bar periods).             Most important, the P/E cycle is not a coincidental wave nor a random walk. P/E is driven by the trend and level of the inflation rate. Higher inflation drives interest rates upward. Investors demand higher returns to offset the adverse impact of inflation. Thus, higher inflation drives P/E lower, so stock-market investors can achieve higher returns from lower prices and higher dividend yields.             Deflation also drives P/E lower. That occurs in response to an expected future of declining nominal earnings and dividends. And declining nominal cash flows during deflation drives current values lower.             Therefore, for more than a century, stock-market investors have endured secular stock-market cycles driven by the inflation-rate cycle. But there is a second variable that determines stock-market valuation. Until recently, that variable could be ignored because it was accepted as a constant. Over the decades, this second variable has seemed to crawl along like the notorious tortoise.             The second variable impacting stock-market value is the growth rate of earnings. Investors know that high-growth companies have higher P/Es than slower-growing, mature companies. The same principle applies to the market overall. It is especially relevant now that the constant of economic growth is uncertain.             During the past century, real economic growth increased at an average of slightly more than 3% annually. As a result of the strong relationship between earnings and the economy, earnings per share (EPS) for the major stock market indexes also increased at near 3% in real terms.             (This makes sense, because how can very broad market indexes grow any faster than the overall economy? Individual companies and industries can, of course, grow faster or slower; but the average is highly correlated with GDP growth plus inflation. – John)             P/E generally peaked in the mid-20s (except during the Great Bubble of the late 1990s) and troughed below 10. The outside range for P/E, as well as its midpoint average near 15.5, occurred with such consistency because the growth rates of both the economy and earnings were so consistent over the long term, at close to 3%.             In effect, the growth rate determines the P/E range and midpoint, and the inflation rate determines the location and trend within the range. A change in growth rate causes a shift in the range. These two dynamics are illustrated in Figure 2. Figure 2. Impact of Growth Rate and Inflation Rate on P/E Mauldin              One effect of slower economic and earnings growth will be a lower level of earnings in the future. For example, over ten years, $1.00 compounds to $1.34 at 3%, but to only $1.22 at 2%. The difference is about 9.3% less EPS for the stock market under the slower growth scenario. Many analysts would consider that level of variance a minor forecasting error for EPS over a decade. Whether the stock market is 9% higher or lower in a decade is generally small change in the context of overall returns. But the implication of slower growth is far more significant than simply the ending level of earnings – slower growth is a game-changer.             There are three ways to assess the effects of slower growth, all of which provide similar results. First, an extremely long-term model of earnings growth, dividend payouts, and present value can be constructed to assess the impact of changes in growth on P/E. Second, academic formulas can be employed to derive the effects on P/E based upon perpetual dividend growth. Third, the impact on P/E can be evaluated through the components of stock-market returns. Since all three approaches reflect comparable results, the more pragmatic third approach will be used here to explore the implications.             Before examining the details, consider the significance of the issue. If the future growth rate of earnings decreases by 1% (i.e., near the reduction that would be expected if economic growth decreases by 1%), the historical average for P/E would decline from 15.5 to 11.5 –amounting to a 26% decline in the stock market beyond the 9% shortfall from lower earnings growth. Even more dramatically, the typical peak in P/E would fall from the low to mid 20s to the mid-teens – the adverse impact of slower growth increases at higher levels of P/E. (This is explained in further detail below.)             As discussed above, inflation causes P/E to decrease because investors demand higher returns in compensation. Unlike the inflation rate, though, the growth rate of earnings does not necessarily change the return level that investors expect. They will still expect returns that are commensurate with the stock market and the expected inflation rate, but they will look to replace the contribution of slower earnings growth with another source of return.             To illustrate, assuming that a change in the growth rate does not change the inflation rate, the yields on government bonds can be expected to remain the same. Absent a change in credit quality from slower growth, the risk premium for corporate bond yields will not change. Likewise, the expected return from stock-market investments can be expected to remain unchanged due to the growth rate.             When slower growth reduces the contribution of earnings growth to total return, another source of return is therefore needed to make up the shortfall. Stock-market investors are not willing to take equity risk without appropriate equity returns. If bond yields do not change, they will not compromise stock-market returns. In this situation, stock-market investors will step away until the price of the market declines until it again provides adequate returns. This is the function of markets: finding the price that provides a fair return.             This discussion relates to the effect from changes in the growth rate of earnings. To isolate that factor, several assumptions are needed, basically providing that the relevant relationships remain the same. First, based upon the previous economics discussion, a downshift in economic growth drives slower earnings growth. Second, long-term profit margins remain similar under both growth scenarios; thus the slowing of earnings growth is consistent with the downshift in economic growth. Third, the inflation rate remains constant across both scenarios for growth. Fourth, the expected return for stocks and bonds as well as the related equity risk premium for stocks does not change across both scenarios for growth. In other words, the relevant relationships remain constant.             Of the three components of stock-market returns, two are available as sources of return, and the third one represents the way in which returns occur. The first source of return, EPS growth, is defined in this example as providing either 3% or 2% toward to the total return (“Historical Growth” and “Slower Growth” bars in Figure 2). As a result, the second source of return, dividend yield, will need to increase to compensate for lower earnings growth in the slower-growth scenario. Herein lies the role of the third source of stock-market returns: changes in P/E.             The dividend yield rises as P/E declines, and vice versa. For the stock market to be positioned to provide equity-level returns, investors will look for the lower price that enables the dividend yield to rise sufficiently to offset the loss of earnings growth. The required decline in P/E varies based upon the starting level of P/E.             If P/E starts relatively high, then a higher decline is required to provide the required dividend yield increase. For example, if EPS growth drops by 1%, then the change in P/E required to increase the dividend yield by 1% is 7 points (from 22 to 15), 4 points (from 15.5 to 11.5), and 2 points (from 10 to 8).             This shift in P/E relates only to the change in earnings growth. P/E would then be further affected by changes in the inflation rate. Figure 3 provides another graphic illustration of the dynamics of the shift and growth cycles. The shift is related to changes in growth rate, and the cycle is driven by inflation-rate trends and levels. Figure 3. Impact of Growth Rate and Inflation Rate on P/E Mauldin As previously mentioned, the two other methodologies provide similar results. A change in the forecast for future earnings due to slower growth results in lower present values. Likewise, the reduction in the growth-rate variable in traditional academic models also produces lower current values.             Well, what about Bill Gross’ future of 1.5% growth, Chris Brightman’s outlook for 1% growth, and Jeremy Grantham’s ultimate rate of 0.4% growth? Two-percent growth downshifts the future average P/E from 15.5 to 11.5. If that is not concerning enough, note that a one-percent growth rate resets the long-term average P/E to near 9.             At this point in time, there is a significant disconnect between the market’s expectation of future growth and the vision of these notable sages. P/E, normalized for the business cycle, is near 20. That is consistent with the current low inflation rate and historical average growth rates. Should it become apparent that either factor might change, beware the adverse impact of another P/E cycle, a new era with P/E shifting downward, or the compounded effects of both concurrently.             There will likely be, and needs to be, much debate about the accuracy of the estimates presented above, and about nuances that could add decimal points to the factors or adjust the effects based upon further scenario assumptions. However, whether using long-term models, academic formulas, or the component-based method, all three approaches provide similar results. It is therefore important to recognize that slower growth will have a significant impact on P/E at all levels of the inflation rate. As the discussion evolves into implications and probable outcomes over this decade, slower economic and earnings growth will have a direct effect on the P/E range.             We are frequently asked how we expect lower valuations to manifest themselves. The single-digit P/E ratios that are typical of the end of a secular bear market and the beginning of a secular bull market would mean either a significant drop in the current valuation of the stock market or a prolonged sideways market. A general awareness and acceptance of a slower-growth economy would certainly help bring about lower valuations.             Investors are confronting the reality of the current secular bear market, which is both a consequence of the previous secular bull market and a precursor to the next secular bull. The duration of the current secular bear period is uncertain. Should higher inflation or deflation overcome the currently rather stable inflation regime in the near term, this secular bear could end sooner, as that would drive valuations down. That outcome, however, would cause significant losses to stock market portfolios. If, however, inflation or deflation slowly creeps into the economy – over the next decade, for example – then this secular bear will be one of the longer ones. However, if this decade repeats the relatively low inflation of the past decade, then the secular bear may linger longer than any of us would like.             Beyond the inflation rate, economic growth will also have an impact on the future of this secular bear. Following last decade’s below-average economic growth, if we are to return to the 3% historic growth trend, then this decade must soon start to generate above-average growth to offset the recent shortfall. The result would be a solid boost to earnings in this decade. However, economic growth could also have downshifted during the last decade to a lower level that will persist for the foreseeable future. The result would be a significantly lower range of P/Es, but not necessarily a progression through and out of the secular bear market. The economic growth rate can shift P/E upward or downward, but only inflation or deflation can kill a secular bear.             Whether this secular bear cycle ends in five years, ten years, or beyond, the ultimate outcome will be the start of the next secular bull market, which will bring an extended period of above-average returns. Spring will finally have sprung. There is a rainbow out there somewhere. This longer-term view of secular stock market cycles lets us look out across this secular bear to the next secular bull. The operative word is “across” this secular bear and not past it.             “Across” recognizes the reality of the risks and opportunities presented by the secular bear in whose grip we find ourselves. “Past” suggests the ostrich-like approach of ignoring reality in the blind hope of an unrealistic outcome. “Across” is enabling, while “past” is disabling.             For investors who are accumulating for the future, secular bear markets are times to build savings for later investment. This is done not only through contributions but also through prudent investing by means of an absolute-return approach. The absolute-return approach uses the dual strategy of risk management and investment selection.             Investment portfolios should be diversified across a range of investments that are diligently selected and actively managed, especially ones that control risk and enhance return. Investors should not avoid the stock market nor bond market altogether. Instead, their objective should be to seek, in both markets, investments that incorporate elements of skill to enhance returns. Secular bear markets are not periods during which to avoid investing; they are periods that demand an adjustment to investment strategy as well as to expectations regarding what potential returns can be.             For investors in pension funds and retirees who are more dependent on their current assets, early recognition is key to the investment strategy. The principles of absolute-return investing are important for preserving capital and generating much-needed returns; but it is potentially even more important for these investors to manage their assumptions and expectations. Recognizing secular-bear market conditions earlier enables investors to make potentially painful adjustments more easily and with less damage. Delaying action until crisis has onset generally brings adverse consequences! Hoping that the next secular bull market will arrive quickly is not a prudent way to address shortfalls. The longer it takes you to adjust expectations, the greater the gap to you will have to fill and the shorter the time you will have to fill it.             This strategy applies most of all to those entrusted with the management of pensions, both private and public. The largest fraction of the monies a pension fund will pay out in the future is expected to come from investment growth. At the beginning of the last decade, pension funds were routinely expecting to get 8% or higher returns on their investment portfolios. Those projections have proved a dismal illusion. Yet pension funds continue to anticipate 7-8% returns going forward. The very people who should know best that past performance is not indicative of future results are expecting the stock market to return to past performance to give them their longed-for results.             These pension-fund shortfalls will mean higher required contributions from corporations. More important, and urgently, they also mean higher required funding for public pensions from taxpayers, accompanied by a reduction of promised benefits. We do not see how the state of Illinois, for example, can meet its obligations without a significant restructuring of its pension plans or its budget, or more likely both. While those receiving pensions would prefer higher taxes on those funding them, there is a limit to what taxpayers will bear.             Sadly, we’re going to find that this is not just an Illinois problem, but one that will become apparent in states, cities, and counties all across the country. This is going to cause a great deal of distress for everyone concerned.             Finally, a comment on GDP growth. The downbeat forecasts mentioned at the beginning of the letter are all based on different methodologies, and we will venture one further argument. It is highly likely that taxes are going to increase over the next few years, and not just due to the current “fiscal cliff” issue. No matter which path is chosen in the short term, it seems improbable that a true resolution to the total deficit issue will be accomplished. More deficit-reduction work will be needed. That means spending cuts, accompanied by yet more tax increases.             However you view the prospect of increased taxes, there is no way to get around the fact that they will reduce general savings. If you reduce savings you reduce the capital available for investment in current and future businesses. If you reduce capital formation, you’re going to reduce future growth. The current fetish among the economic thought leaders is that consumption is the driver of GDP growth. But GDP growth is ultimately a reflection of increases in population and productivity. And if you want to increase productivity, you must increase capital available for investment.             Note that this is a circular argument. If we increase taxes, we reduce the potential for GDP growth by reducing the capital available for investment, which of course makes the rosy growth projections of government forecasters fall short, thus driving future deficits even higher, minus further deficit-reduction efforts. As Chris Brightman writes: The most important determinant of our productivity per person is the amount of capital we have available for investment, and wise use of that capital. Investing to improve productivity in all of its forms, from machine tools, to transportation infrastructure, to education, can all raise our productivity. Investing requires savings, and we have been saving far too little. To increase productivity requires that we reorient our economy away from debt-financed consumption and toward saving-financed investment.             The politicians in Washington all give lip service to the need for growth. But then they turn around and do the very things that make it more difficult for the economy to grow. And as we have seen, this is going to make it more difficult for the stock market to return to a secular bull path. Which will create a greater need for higher taxes and/or reduced spending on the state and local levels. Which of course hurts GDP growth.             We are coming to the Endgame. There are no easy solutions, only very difficult ones. And none of them bode well for future equity valuations.             John here: I can tell you that there is deep concern when Ed and I talk about the consequences of government actions and potentially slow GDP growth for the average investor. All too few people understand the links between government decisions and their retirement portfolios. If you are reading this letter, you are one of those few. You do have options, but there are no easy options any more.             For those interested in cycles I suggest you take a close look at Ed’s books, Unexpected Returns and Probable Outcomes, and his excellent website, www.Crestmontresearch.com. It is a treasure trove of knowledge. At the beginning of each year, Ed updates most of the website’s charts and graphs, many of which were included in one or both of his books.             I also recently wrote a paper along these lines, published by my partners at Altegris, on its home page (to access it, first you must indicate what type of investor you are). My paper focuses on managed futures, and you’ll find other papers on alternative investments, along with a lot of worthwhile research Altegris has done. “Alternative investing” is increasingly a part of accepted investing methodology. In my opinion, alternatives should be defined broadly to mean not sitting back and depending on “buy and hope” (otherwise known as buy and hold) equity indexes. We will have reason to explore this topic further in the coming year!             You will likely be getting this letter on New Year’s Eve. Let me wish you a very happy and prosperous new year. I’m going to begin the new year by flying to Santa Barbara to be with my friend and partner Jon Sundt of Altegris Investments at his home up at the Hollister Ranch. While we will spend some time, as we always do, talking about alternative investments and ways to make them more readily available to investors, I will spend the bulk of my time thinking about my annual forecast letter, which I will write this coming weekend. I spend more time researching this one letter than anything else I write, and this year will be no different.             I’ll fly back on Saturday and then leave Sunday afternoon for Europe. I’ll be there for over two weeks. The first portion of the trip, I will be in Scandinavia on a speaking tour for Skagen Funds. I am finalizing details for the remaining time, but I intend to go to Greece and then make a quick stop in Geneva. I really want to experience Greece firsthand, rather than just through the eyes of other writers.             I will fly to Toronto on Sunday, January 27 to spend some time with my friend David Rosenberg. He has recently returned from Jerusalem (or, as he wrote me, “Yerushalayim”), where he celebrated the bar mitzvah of his youngest son, Mikey. Mazel tov, young man. Then I’ll meet with my longtime friend and natural-resource maven Rick Rule and the team at Sprott Asset Management. And that evening I’ll do a speech for my Canadian partner, John Nicola of Nicola Wealth Management. (If you are interested in attending the speech, drop me a note and I will send it on to John N.) From Toronto, I’ll probably move on to New York and DC.             Let me suggest that you spend a few moments with this most-excellent, if somewhat sad, video of the music of the great artists who graced our lives and passed away this year. I admit to having played it a few times. Thanks to each of them for the memories.             My daughter Amanda took it upon herself to decorate my home for Christmas this year. We went out and bought a tree right after Thanksgiving, and then she took over. I must admit, it was more festive in the house than I remember it ever being. And the tree was quite fragrant. Also, the family was around more, for whatever reason. They just seemed to want to be together more this year. It was a great time and I enjoyed being home with the kids and grandkids and having some time off from the road.             Yesterday, Amanda also ended up with the task of putting everything away. She up to my office, where I was, as usual, reading and writing. She had a sad look on her face. “Dad, I hate putting up the Christmas stuff. It’s so sad.”             I made some lame comment about time passing and how much fun it had been and how she had made the house so beautiful. And then I looked in her eyes. I did not see what I expected; there were tears there. “I really don’t like for Christmas to be over. It’s my favorite time of the year.” I hugged her, and then I’m sure I made another lame Dad comment about how next year she will have a baby (due in early April) to celebrate Christmas with.             I miss it too, Amanda. Time passes so quickly, and those moments when we are together are the ones that I treasure most. They are all too few, and then they’re gone, and there’s just a Christmas tree lying forlornly out in the alley. Except that we still have the memories. And this year I have the special memory of Amanda and those tears. I will never forget it. And I think when I see my mother tomorrow I will ask her too about some Christmases past. I bet that at 95 she can still remind me of a few special moments I have forgotten.             Have a great week. Thanks for spending yet another year with me. And I look forward to 2013 being the best and most interesting one ever.

Here it is. The full text of the: American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, AKA the bill to avert the Fiscal Cliff. Why is it a 157 pages? Because in addition to the tax and spending stuff, there's all kinds of goodies, like extensions of credits for green energy, and all that stuff in there, that they always put in these things.
