The report is titled "America‚Äôs Families and Living Arrangements: 2012" and its findings include the following bullets. ‚Ä¢ Sixty-six percent of households in 2012 were family households, down from 81 percent in 1970. ‚Ä¢ Between 1970 and 2012, the share of households that were married couples with children under 18 halved from 40 percent to 20 percent. ‚Ä¢ The proportion of one-person households increased by 10 percentage points between 1970 and 2012, from 17 percent to 27 percent. ‚Ä¢ Between 1970 and 2012, the average number of people per household declined from 3.1 to 2.6. The following charts really drive home the way things have changed. Census.gov Census.gov Census.gov
According to the Treasury Department's popular Treasury International Capital System (TICS) report, official foreign holdings of Treasury securities fell to $4.009 trillion in June from $4.072 trillion in May. So it would seem that the world's central banks are exiting U.S. securities. "There are, however, many problems with such an interpretation, and in fact it seems likely that the worldís central banks are increasing their allocations to US assets," wrote UBS's Paul Donovan in a brief research note today. He identifies three issues with TICS, which we paraphrase: "Investors who try to use the TICS data as a guide to currency intervention by emerging market central banks are likely to be misled," said Donovan. That's the gist of Donovan's note. But he also has a message for all of us in financial media: ...there is a worry arising from the interpretation of the TICS data. The US Treasury may have been clear about the limitations of the TICS numbers, but the detailed explanations do not appear to have been heard in what might be termed the ìeconomic blogsphereî. The ëarmchair economistí who offers casual opinion online and via email may be seduced by the data description ìforeign official holdings of US Treasuriesî into believing that the data does actually show comprehensive foreign official holdings of US Treasuries ñ when of course it does not. The role of non-expert opinion in financial markets has been growing in recent years. The considerable complexity (and equally considerable gaps in knowledge) that surround the Treasuryís reporting of official holdings of US assets could lead to the dissemination of well intentioned misinformation...

REUTERS/Arnd WiegmannLawrence Summers, then Director of the National Economic Council yawns during a session at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, January 30, 2010.Economists at BNP Paribas have issued a research note saying if President Obama picks Larry Summers as the next Federal Reserve Chairman, he will do serious harm to the U.S. economy. Julia Coronado, Chief Economist for North America at BNP, and her colleagues Bricklin Dwyer and Laura Rosner estimated in a note last week that picking Summers over Fed Vice Chair Janet Yellen would shave 0.5 to 0.75 points off GDP growth over two years and cut job creation by 350,000 to 500,000 jobs. Here‚Äôs their argument: Coronado and her colleagues end with this sobering observation (emphasis mine): The bottom line is that the policy uncertainty introduced by a Larry Summers candidacy would likely come with an economic price tag in terms of market stability and growth. Nonetheless, the efficacy of monetary policy does not seem to be the driving force in this nomination process and the forces in Washington seem to be moving in the direction of a Summers nomination. That part, I think, is not totally right. Yes, there are major non-monetary factors driving this decision: Obama appears to be driven in part by his desire to install a close and trusted advisor at the Federal Reserve, regardless of policy specifics. And many of Summers‚Äô critics from the left are more focused on bank regulation issues and his past comments on women in science than they are on monetary policy. But Summers also appears to align more than Yellen with the president‚Äôs own hawkish monetary policy instincts. When the New York Times asked Obama back in July what he was looking for in a Fed chair, his remarks focused heavily on controlling inflation and preventing bubbles. The president likely shares Coronado‚Äôs view that Summers would be more hawkish on monetary policy than Yellen. But he probably sees that as a feature, not a bug.
Jeff Cully/EEFAS After five years of construction, designer Calvin Klein's minimalist mansion in Southampton, NY is nearly complete. The home, on a 10-acre oceanfront lot on Meadow Lane, cost some $75 million to build, including the price of the land.¬† The New York Times Jacob Bernstein delved into the property in this weekend's Sunday Styles section. The entire piece is worth a read, but here are some of the juiciest tidbits about the house, which has been the talk of the Hamptons all summer: Klein gut-renovated the original home on the property, then tore it down entirely and began building from scratch. Before starting construction, the designer built a life-sized mock-up of the project out of plywood, costing an estimated $350,000. He's been through three different architects in five years. Klein is extremely hands-on. "As [friends] tell it, he is here six days a week, sometimes for several hours at a time. He talks about the house nonstop," Bernstein writes. "He has personally vetted and approved every floorboard and object inside, even designed much of the furniture himself when he thought there was nothing out there that quite met his exacting design standards." He gets frequent construction photos and updates from his friend Aby Rosen, the well-known real estate developer who lives next door. Klein designed every room with sliding glass doors "so that anywhere he is can essentially become an outdoor space." The guest wing connects to the main home via an underground passageway. And another nearby building will be used as a screening room. Photo above courtesy of Jeff Cully/EEFAS. Read the full article at The New York Times &gt;
Randy von Liski via www.flickr.com creative commonsAlarmed by the explosion of high-cost lending in the state, cities across Texas have passed ordinances to prevent the cycle of debt that short-term, high-cost loans can create. But some big lenders are¬†finding clever waysaround the laws ‚Äì like giving away cash for free. TitleMax¬†promises¬†to ‚Äúmake getting cash easy!‚Äù To get a loan, borrowers with ‚Äúgood credit, bad credit, or no credit‚Äù need only turn over the title to their car. In Dallas, San Antonio, and Austin ‚Äì which have all passed lending laws ‚Äì those loans have come with zero percent interest. What‚Äôs the catch? After 30 days, the loan is due in full. If the borrower cannot pay ‚ÄìTitleMax‚Äôs average loan is for $1,300 ‚Äì the borrower is sent to another TitleMax location outside of the city, where he or she can receive a new, unrestricted loan. That loan, states¬†a contract¬†given to one borrower, could have an annual rate as high as 310 percent. Of course, the borrower would be free to renew the loan at that location ‚Äì over and over again. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a bait and switch,‚Äù said Ann Baddour of the non-profit Texas Appleseed. ‚ÄúThe practice may not be illegal, but it‚Äôs definitely unethical and unconscionable.‚Äù TitleMax declined to comment. Like other high-cost lenders, the company touts its products as an option for borrowers who might not qualify for other sources of credit. An auto-title loan is similar to its better known cousin, the payday loan ‚Äì but larger and with more at stake. Typically, the borrower hands over title to her car and agrees to pay off the loan after one month. If she can‚Äôt do that, she can pay only the interest due and roll over the principal to the next month. As¬†with payday loans, the cycle can repeat itself over and over. A¬†study¬†by the Consumer Federation of America and Center for Responsible Lending found that the average borrower renews a loan eight times. A borrower who defaults risks having her car seized. (Disclosure: The Center and ProPublica both get significant funding from The Sandler Foundation.)¬† In six TitleMax contracts from Texas reviewed by ProPublica, the company actually charged an annual rate ranging from 145 to¬†182 percent. TitleMax‚Äôs ploy is the latest example of¬†high-cost lenders‚Äô ingenuity when confronted by unwanted laws. In Texas, at least eight towns and cities have passed lending ordinances in the past two years.Together, the new laws cover over four million Texans. The ordinances come at a time of explosive growth for TitleMax‚Äôs parent company, TMX Finance, one of the largest title lenders in the country. The company has more than 1,200 stores across 14 states and will¬†soon move into its 15th. In its home state of Georgia, TMX boasts more than 300 locations ‚Äì more branches than any bank. (Wells Fargo and SunTrust come closest with around 280 branches statewide each.). The company has doubled in size since 2008 and says it plans to keep up the same rate of growth. TMX‚Äôs growth is especially evident in Texas, where it has opened more than 150 stores in the past two years. It continues to operate in cities that have passed ordinances. Under the names of TitleMax and TitleBucks, for instance, TMX operates a total of more than 80 stores in Dallas, Austin, and San Antonio. Last December, Texas‚Äôs regulator for payday and auto-title lenders announced ‚Äì¬† without naming TitleMax ‚Äì that it was ‚Äúconcerned‚Äù about the practice of offering a zero percent loan to customers in those cities. The offer might prove too tempting to someone who might otherwise never take out an auto-title loan, said the regulator in¬†a bulletin to lenders: ‚ÄúThis business model could also be perceived as a deceptive practice because it appears calculated to bring the consumer into the store with the promise of one product, but later effectively requires the consumer to go to another location to purchase another product.‚Äù In a statement to ProPublica, Dana Edgerton, spokeswoman for the Office of Consumer Credit Commissioner, said that the agency was not aware of any other lenders besides TitleMax offering a zero percent loan. Despite their concerns, state regulators do not have authority to enforce the city‚Äôs ordinances, Edgerton said. It can only warn lenders of potential consequences ‚Äì a warning TMX has not heeded. The city of Denton‚Äôs lending ordinance, which passed in March, prohibits payday and auto-title lenders from renewing borrowers‚Äô loans more than three times. ‚ÄúThat was the biggest thing, just having some kind of end point,‚Äù said Kayce Strader of the non-profit Serve Denton. As soon as Denton‚Äôs law went into effect, according to¬†a class action lawsuit filed in June in state court, TitleMax notified its current customers there would be a change. They would no longer be able to renew their loan in Denton. Instead, customers had a choice: They could pay off the loan in full or accept a zero percent loan. That loan, in turn, would not be renewable at the Denton location. But,¬†the notice says, ‚ÄúWe want you to know that we will work with you during this transition period.‚Äù Where to go, then? TitleMax also has a location 15 miles down the highway in Flower Mound, Texas, the notice says. ‚Äú[You] may want to consider doing business‚Äù there, and once you‚Äôve switched, ‚Äúyou can continue transacting at that location,‚Äù¬†it says. According to the suit, the named plaintiffs all got caught renewing TitleMax loans over and over. One allegedly¬†renewed her loan 23 times, paid at least $10,800 in fees, and after all that still owed $3,961. Another,¬†the suit says, renewed her loan twelve times. By switching such customers to a location outside Denton, TitleMax would have been able to continue renewing the loans without restriction. The suit charges TitleMax duped customers into thinking they were paying down their balance when they were in reality just paying the same fees again and again. TitleMax denies the allegations and is contesting the suit. The company‚Äôs attorney declined comment.

Rob WileThe nation of Qatar, with a slightly new look.Since 1997, the Arab state of Qatar has dominated the liquefied natural gas market, and today holds the title of world's largest supplier of the fuel. In a new note titled, "Forget Saudi America, What about Qatari America?", AllianceBernstein's Bob Brackett proclaims the advent of "Qatari America," saying the U.S. LNG market is set to explode. First: LNG is basically plain old natural gas that's easier to ship (it gets turned back into natural gas when it reaches its destination), and has the same uses. Anyway, Brackett writes that we're either in the middle or beginning of a boom: 2013 has proven to be a momentous year for the global LNG industry, with a record number of North American LNG projects being contemplated as companies seek to arbitrage the natural gas pricing differential between North America and the rest of the world. The economic incentive is clear ñNorth American LNG export is feasible due to lower cost of production (a result of both high EURs vs. results internationally and a developed oilfield services industry) and robust international demand for gas. The Department of Energy must approve all LNG exports, and the number of projects getting the okay has actually slowed as federal regulators weigh gains to the broader economy from more exports against rising prices for consumers. But Brackett using data from a recent DOE report for various production and export scenarios, Brackett shows that under any scenario there is a net gain to the welfare of the average U.S. household over the long term: Brackett/Bernstein Each bar represents a different recovery and export scenario ó but they're all positive. The approval bottle-neck is thus causing the U.S. to miss out on a big opportunity, Brackett says: If we were US energy policy makers, we'd recommend the approval of ~1.5-2 Bcfd of export capacity each year. We believe this level represents an amount of shale gas production growth that can be achieved with a reasonable, but not too†high, price signal that would be palatable to consumers and producers alike. In addition, approving 1.5-2 Bcfd of export capacity (which would likely take ~3-4 years to build) implies that only 5-8 Bcfd of export growth would be in the queue at any point in time, allowing the government to monitor price impacts as exports layer-in (and apply brakes if needed). Brackett says U.S. natgas prices are going to hover around $4 given current production trends, giving it a huge cost advantage over direct competitors: Not surprisingly, the net benefits are the highest when the cost to produce shale gas in the US is the lowest. And we believe the US is going to have plenty of shale gas supply produced at a low cost. As bullish as this all seems, things probably aren't going to change overnight, though. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz says he's basically aware of all this, but that the Department will continue to process applications on a case-by-case basis.
So, how exactly does the business of higher education work? Michael Zezas, a municipal bond analyst for Morgan Stanley offers this interesting flow chart to show a rough breakdown of the cash inflows and outflows. Morgan Stanley Zezas breaks down the sources of revenue for public and private institutions. "As shown in Exhibit 6, tuition is the biggest revenue driver for both public and private higher education institutions (at 33% and 38%, respectively)," he writes. "However, state appropriations make up a larger share of public institutional revenues (20% vs. 1%) while investment income and gifts is more important for private institutions (15% vs. 3%)." One source of business the average person probably doesn't realize is affiliated hospitals, which are used to train med students and conduct research, while generating revenue for the institution. Morgan Stanley Zezas employs a debt weighting to the above chart as his research is targeted to investors of higher education municipal bonds. "Public and private universities issue muni bonds to finance the construction of academic buildings, student housing, and other capital projects," he writes.
Reuters/Mike SegarFA Insights is a daily newsletter from Business Insider that delivers the top news and commentary for financial advisors. A Morgan Stanley Advisor Lands A $70 Million Account Through LinkedIn (Think Advisor) A financial advisor, Mitchell Rock, who heads the Rock Group at Morgan Stanley, got a $70 million account by reconnecting with someone on LinkedIn. From Think Advisor: "A Morgan Stanley senior vice president, Rock, previously with UBS and Oppenheimer &amp; Co., had been on LinkedIn about seven months, when one night he spotted the profile of a man with whom he‚Äôd had business dealings 12 years before. The two had lost touch. Rock promptly shot him an e-mail, updating him on his current focus and directing him to his website, featuring The Rock Group brochure. "'Oh, my God! I have a friend in North Carolina who‚Äôs looking to work with a New York investment team just like yours,' Rock recalls the man telling him. The friend had sold his company about six months earlier and wanted a New York money manager to invest the $70 million in proceeds. ‚Ä¶An introduction was made, and thee weeks later, 'we had a very large account,' Rock says." Of course, Rock doesn't think social media should replace other forms of marketing. He does however think they should be used in conjunction with one another. Investors Still Love Ultrashort-Term Bond Funds (The Wall Street Journal)  Ultra short-term bond funds, funds with attractive yields that give investors access to money in a few months,¬† had $5.38 billion in inflows in the year through July, after seeing $9.46 billion in inflows last year, according to data from Morningstar. The Wall Street Journal reports that these ultra short-term bond funds are set to match last years. Some advisors use these funds irrespective of where interest rates are. This is because of the risk that comes with "additional yield on longer-maturity bonds". Although, ultrashort funds also took their fair share of blows because of their investment in risky assets.  Gold Is No Longer The World's Worst Asset Class (Deutsche Bank) After a slump that began in April, investors began to flood out of gold. But emerging markets have snatched away the title of 'the worst performing asset class' after the Brazilian stock market, the South African rand, and the Indian rupee took huge hits. Deutsche BankSan-Diego Based Investment Adviser Charged With Cherry-Picking And Soft Dollar Schemes (SEC)  The SEC alleges that J.S. Oliver Capital Management and its president Ian O. Mausner were involved in a "cherry-picking scheme that awarded more profitable trades to hedge funds in which Mausner and his family had invested.¬† Meanwhile they doled out less profitable trades to other clients, including a widow and a charitable foundation.¬† The disfavored clients suffered approximately $10.7 million in harm." Mausner is also alleged to have misused "soft dollars, which are credits or rebates from a brokerage firm on commissions paid by clients for trades executed in the investment adviser‚Äôs client accounts." The San-Diego based advisor is reported to have engaged in this scheme from June 2008 to November 2009 by waiting to allocate trades until after the market close or the next trading day because this would five him time to see how the securities had performed. Investors Should Focus More On Dividend Growth And Less On Yield (Gluskin Sheff)  In a rising rate environment, Gluskin Sheff's David Rosenberg writes that investors should focus more on dividend growth rather than yield. Especially since the stock market now "seems range-bound pretty well all of this year's 14.5% capital appreciation occurred in the first four months of the year." "But accumulating cash flow is still paramount, but the screening shifts less towards the yield and more to companies that have low payout ratios but a history of providing consistent distributors."

REUTERS/Jon NazcaTwo Spanish tourists walk past a broken traffic signal lying on the ground as they try to find the correct direction to the Spanish border to enter the British territory of Gibraltar in La Linea de la Concepcion, southern Spain September 1, 2013. Spain wants to resume bilateral talks with Britain as soon as possible over the sovereignty of Gibraltar, Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo wrote in the Wall Street Journal late last month.Investors came back from their long weekends to bid stocks slightly higher. First, the scoreboard: And now, the top stories:
The comfort point is easy to tackle; a well tailored suit is as comfortable as a polo shirt and jeans. An uncomfortable suit is either not your size or made from a fabric unsuitable for your climate. Ties are an issue for some and if they make you feel uncomfortable, avoid them completely; just donít forget to undo the top two buttons of your dress shirt. On to the more complex point of feeling uptight in a suit; this is a commonly held reason for eschewing suits but entirely avoidable. The reason why many men appear uptight, stiff and boring in a suit is due to a lack of confidence in how they look. This lack of confidence leads to excessive thought being placed on their attire and negative posture. To look good in a suit you need to feel good about wearing it. Walk down a busy city street and youíll see hundreds of men in suits. You wonít notice 99% of them; theyíre just men in dull suits. Every now and then someone will stand out; they look cool, slick, and gloriously confident. This man wears the suit, the suit doesnít wear him. Part of you wants to be this guy. So how do you do it? The first step is by far the most important. Fit. A handcrafted Italian suit will look horrendous if itís the wrong size. Here are my simple pointers for getting a good fit when buying off the rack: Shoulders are the most important to get right as they canít really be altered. Make sure they are as wide as your shoulders and no wider. Jacket length is next in importance as alterations are very tricky. ëTrendyí suits can have very short jackets; these can look good but donít flatter the majority of builds. Stick to the classic length, with the jacket long enough to cover your seat. Sleeve length and waist are less important to get exactly right off the rack as these can be altered to a certain extent. The sleeve should end exactly at your wrist bone and the waist nipped in to highlight the shape of your torso. Trousers are easier to get right. Make sure the trousers are designed for how you wear them; pleated trousers are designed to be worn on the natural waist and flat fronts are generally meant to be worn lower. Make sure the trouser leg is just long enough to cover your socks when standing still. The other details are easy to get right: Natural fibres should always be chosen over synthetics, suits are usually made from wool and shirts from cotton. Thinner wool and linen suits are a great choice for summer and cotton can work for a more casual look. Shirt fit is personal preference, though more fitted is advisable. The only vital fit point is sleeve length; the cuff should end at the base of your palm; this will allow around half an inch of cuff to show. Invest in shoes. Spend upwards of $400 on a pair of well made shoes and they will last for years with regular maintenance. Avoid the whims of fashion and buy a classic brogue or cap toe with closed laces and leather soles. It is advisable to own two pairs of shoes so each pair can rest a day between wears. A suit needs a pocket square and I suggest simply folded white Irish linen. If you wear double cuff shirts, cufflinks will be necessary; keep them solid metal and simple. Ties should be simply patterned, moderately wide and made from silk. Keep away from matching ties and pocket squares at all costs. So youíve got the clothes. The next step is looking like you belong in them. The way to achieve this is through what the Italianís call Sprezzatura. Basically, itís all about appearing like you havenít tried incredibly hard to look as good as you do. Itís a simple step many men miss out, resulting in that overly polished look that you want to avoid. Minimising accessories is the first step here; tie clips that are perfectly aligned mid chest look stuffy and are generally unnecessary. Complex pocket square folds and trying too hard to match patterns, colours and metals have the same effect. From here, all you need is one simple rule:
This weekend, the New York Times' Nick Madigan called Florida a "hothouse of corruption," reporting the Sunshine State saw the greatest number of people convicted of public corruption between 2000 and 2010. That's technically true. But it's not the full story. To get a true sense of the most corrupt state, we need to know how many convictions there have been on a population basis. So we went back to Justice Department data cited by Madigan,¬†to see which states saw the greatest number of convictions per 100,000 (Madigan actually appears to cite slightly outdated data; the latest covers the period between 2002 and 2011). No. 1? Louisiana, with nearly 9 convictions per 100,000 people. The Dakotas are runners up.¬† The states with the fewest conviction rates were South Carolina, Oregon, Washington, New Hampshire, Minnesota and Utah, each with no more than 1.3 convictions per 100,000.¬† And Florida? Only the 20th-most corrupt, with 3.28 convictions per 100,000 ‚Äî basically, just a bit above average. Here's the full chart: Justice Department
Reuters/ Brendan McDermidWilliam Stiritz is now the largest individual shareholder in Herbalife. The 77-year-old investor disclosed in a 13G regulatory filing with the SEC today that he personally owns¬†5,382,362 shares, or a 5.22% stake, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The second biggest individual shareholder is Herbalife's CEO, Michael Johnson. ¬†Johnson owns over a million shares.¬† Stiritz's Herbalife stake is worth about $322 million or so. ¬†That a huge stake for an individual. ¬† It's unclear what his personal networth is exactly. ¬†We couldn't find any record of Stiritz on any of the billionaire's lists. [hat tip: @TheSkeptic21] Stiritz is currently the CEO and chairman of food company Post Holdings. ¬†He's also Post's largest individual shareholder with a 1.13% stake. ¬†He owns approximately 369,662 shares, Bloomberg data shows. ¬†That would make his Post stake worth just over $15 million.¬† He now owns a bigger Herbalife stake than his Post stake.¬† Herbalife is a multi-level marketing firm that sells nutrition products such as weight loss shakes and vitamins.¬†The company is at the center of a huge hedge fund battle. ¬† Back in December, Bill Ackman, who runs Pershing Square Capital, disclosed in a 300-plus slide presentation that he's short $1 billion worth of Herbalife stock. ¬†His thesis is that he believes the company is a "pyramid scheme" that targets lower income people, particularly from the Hispanic population.¬† Ackman thinks that regulators, particularly the Federal Trade Commission, will be persuaded to investigate the company and shut it down.¬† Not everyone agrees, though.¬† Ackman's former friend Daniel Loeb of Third Point amassed an 8.2% stake in Herbalife shortly after Ackman's presentation. ¬†He exited that position for a profit.¬† Long-time rival of Ackman's, billionaire investor Carl Icahn, stepped in and bought a massive stake. ¬†Icahn believes Ackman will be the victim of the "mother of all short squeezes."

The impact of this on the international art market is about to be felt in art auctions scheduled for later this month and in October in London and New York. Thatís because Pinchukís record-priced acquisitions of two artists, Englishman Damien Hirst and American Jeff Koons, have created an overhang of their works in the market place. According to speculation by London and New York art dealing sources, these works may be forced into sale at a heftier discount than Hirst and Koons have already been taking. Art market reports†show†that sales by Hirst have dropped from $45.8m in 2008 to $18.3m in 2012 ñ and that doesnít count the volume of works failing to sell at all. Since then,†according†to the New York Times, Hirst works are fetching 60% less than was originally paid for them. To reduce the supply, Hirstís production company Science Ltd. has†issued†a catalogue of itemizing one line of purportedly authentic works and inviting owners to apply to Hirst for an authenticity check.Part of Hirstís problem is that one of his production lines, the so-called spot series, has turned out at least one thousand,†according†to Hirst; more than 1,200 according to other sources. Art market sources currently report that the Koons work, Hanging Heart, for which Pinchuk paid $23.6 million in†November 2007†is now down to $11 million. In May of this year, an attempt to resell a 1980s work by Koons comprising four vacuum cleaners encased in acrylic failed to reach the $10 million reserve ó and†failed†to sell at all. When Pinchuk paid Koons more than anyone else had ever paid for a living artistís piece of work, he was beating the record the Qatar ruling family had set in June of the same year when it paid £9.7 million ($19.2 million) for a Hirst work calledLullaby Spring. As bluntly as a Hirst shark in formaldehyde, when Pinchuk is feeling financial stress, his premium-priced holding of Hirst art is in a†pickle too. This is a conventional case of over-supply in relation to demand; since Pinchuk started buying Hirst, one-third of Hirstís works at auction are reportedly failing to find a buyer. But the falling Hirst value also triggers Pinchukís obligation to stave off margin calls from the banks which may have financed the art buying in the first place. An advisor to banks lending on art assets says that Deutsche Bank and Citi ñ banks with a known association with Pinchuk ñ ìtypically lend on a recourse basis, when the art would be part of an asset pool securing the loan. Their loan value would usually be 40% to 60%, depending on the individual [borrower]. There would definitely be collateral in addition to the art work itself.î Since Citi and other creditors in the syndicate lending to Pinchuk have imposed fresh borrowing, pledge and borrowing limits, a significant loss of value in Hirst or Koons may oblige Pinchuk to raise more cash. ìThe only way to do that in the art market is financing by art capital groups,î says the advisor. That is also ìfor between 40% and 60%. But the interest can run up to 18% per annum.î Where to find cash has been problematic for Pinchuk since his cash-cow, not the Hirst variety but Interpipe, defaulted on its debts in 2011 and was obliged by its banks to undergo restructuring. One of the conditions for that was to require Pinchuk to put cash into Interpipe. Another was to stop him taking cash out. Poor cow. According to Pinchukís latest financial report, his group debt as of December 31, 2012, was $1.05 billion. Required for repayment this year is $312.3 million. The company revenues for 2012 came to $1.8 billion; there was a net loss of $71.7 million. As reported†here, the collapse of demand for Pinchukís pipes in the Ukraine and abroad increased his dependency on Russia to take a growing share of his products. In 2012 the Russian share was 28% ($497 million). From July 1 of this year, the imposition of penalty import duties by Russian Customs will cut this amount substantially. To stay solvent and meet the debts to a syndicate of international banks, Interpipe is paying Libor plus 4% on loans, and up to 13% on bonds. Here is†the report†as released on the company website. The report acknowledges that during 2011 Interpipe was in default to its banks. The report doesnít identify the banks, but sources close to Interpipe identify them as including Citi, Barclays, Credit Agricole, ING, and two Italian money houses ó Intesa and the Intesa-owned subsidiary CIB. Pinchuk regularly entertains Hirst and their Italian friends at the Venice Biennale and off Capo Ferro in Sardinia, where his motor yacht, ìOnenessî, drops anchor during the summer season. Right is artist Hirst at the current Pinchuk Venice show. In addition to Intesa, Italyís largest bank, the Italian government is also heavily exposed to Pinchukís debts, and to the sinking prospects described in the latest financial report as ìmarket downturns and economic slowdowns elsewhere in the worldî. SACE, the Italian export credit agency, financed the delivery and installation of steelmaking equipment by Danieli and other Italian suppliers at Interpipeís new mill†at Dnepropetrovsk. SACE was given $10 million for rolling over Interpipeís debts; the government agency in Milan is currently owed between $136 million and $322 million. The exact debt owing isnít clear, nor is the security SACE accepted for its exposure. Danieli says the cost of its investment in Interpipeís mill was Ä260 million. Intesa is not mentioned in the Interpipe reports; but it is one of the main members of the bank syndicate involved in the restructuring. Aggregate debt to the syndicate is currently at least $543.7 million. Because of the cross-default provisions covering Interpipeís indebtedness, each of the syndicate banks is in theory required to recognize an event of default in its exposure, and provision for loss in its shareholder reports. But even before default is recognized by the banks, the impact of the Russian penalty duty action against Interpipe sales in Russia is a ìmaterial adverse effectî which Pinchuk is obliged to report to SACE, Intesa and the others. A margin call or debt restructuring, issued in relation to the financing of art acquisitions, would also be reportable if the security extends to assets linked to the Interpipe group and Pinchukís other assets. The Interpipe financial report reveals that of the $110.7 million in cash which Interpipe claims to have held at the end of last year, $69.3 million was tied down as collateral to secure the loans. If the balance has been deposited in Pinchukís bank, Bank Credit Dnepr, it may also be securing that bankís liquidity and cannot be withdrawn. The bank, also wholly owned by Pinchuk through a chain of offshore fronts and trusts,†reported†a negligible profit in 2011; it is more than a year late in publishing audited results for 2012. The Interpipe report acknowledges also that most of Pinchukís steelmaking assets are pledged for loan repayment, plus a third of the $187 million in unsold pipe inventories, plus $430 million in receivables and ìrights arising out of sales contractsî. Pinchuk himself has been required by the banks to add $65 million of personal cash in additional equity capital; $40 million in a personal letter of credit; and to accept a ban on receiving dividends from company operations. If a court were to rule Interpipe is in debt to a supplier by more than $20 million, and fails to pay, the banks and Italyís SACE would be required to declare a default, leaving Pinchuk exposed to ìacceleration and enforcement by the lenders of the security provided.î Since much of Interpipeís financial foundation depends on Pinchukís personal liquidity, and his personal bank appears to lack that too, the risk is growing that Pinchuk may have to cash in private assets to meet the banksí claims on Interpipe. Pinchukís spending on Hirst, Koons and others has generated an art market rating thatís currently spot 32 on ArtReviewís ì100 most influential people in the art worldî. Hirst is at spot 41, Koons at 58. The only Russian on the list, one spot in front of Koons, is†Pussy Riot. If buying Hirst and Koons has moved Pinchuk up the ArtReview ladder, what will happen to all three if Pinchuk starts selling them? Christieís Department for Post-War and Contemporary Art has scheduled sales in London, New York and Amsterdam for September, October and November. The pipeline isnít publicly reported in advance, but it is believed there is no major Hirst work on offer. So far this year, Hirst has been selling off works well below the $1 million mark; those which have sold have generally failed to reach the top of Christieís†target range. Sources say that there is growing difficulty in getting Hirstís price, and finding any buyers at all for his big-ticket items. Christieís was recently able to sell a Hirst work called ìMy Wayî, after Sothebyís failed to find a buyer at £1.1 million. The markdown or discount was 21%. One of Hirstís formaldehyde installations, a sheep, sold in New York in February of this year for £1.95 million, 22% below the top of the reserve range. In a†report†published recently with Deloitte, Anders Petterson of Art Tactic, a London art market consultancy, reports that market confidence in Hirst and Koons has been falling even though Pettersonís measure of overall art market confidence has been growing ó see page 69. According to Petterson, the measure of confidence is taken from a survey of about one hundred experts, dealers and artistís agents. Following the London contemporary art auctions of last month, Petterson hasreported†ìthe market is showing resistance to work priced between £1 million to £3 million. A total of 11 works estimated above £1 million failed to sell, missing out on £20.85 million in potential sales (based on average estimate). Whilst several of the works estimated above £1 million failed to sell, a total of 37 works below £500,000 exceeded their average pre-sale estimate, which suggests that buyers are looking for value in lower price segments.î Petterson was asked how much of the Hirst asset stock is in Pinchukís hands. He was also asked what he estimates the price trend has been for Hirst since 2007-2008. He responded that precise numbers are difficult to come by. ì[Pinchuk] is among one of the most important collectors and supporters of Damien Hirst.î Hirstís website†claims†that a Pinchuk show in 2009 was ìone of Hirstís largest shows to dateî, but ownership of the works wasnít disclosed. Hirstís management company is less enthusiastic than Hirst or Pinchuk in acknowledging their relationship. Hirstís company, Science Ltd., was asked to identify the largest single owner of his works, other than Hirst or related parties; and what number of Hirst works have been acquired by or for Pinchuk. James Kelly, Hirstís business manager, said that ownership information is ìfirstly extremely confidential, and secondly is not necessarily information that we hold. As the majority of Damienís artworks are sold through his galleries, he often is not privy to the information as to where the artworks are eventually placed. It would therefore be inappropriate for this office to comment on any individualís holdings of Damienís artworks. Also please note that a significant number of artworks do trade on the secondary market, and therefore there may be many collectors that have large collections of Damienís work that have only ever acquired them through the secondary market such as auctions etc.î The Pinch art collection curators in Kiev want to advertise the collection, but are evasive on how many Hirsts or Koonses they have purchased, or still hold. Without giving particulars, a reporter for the New Yorker†was told†that Pinchuk ìhas a great collection of KoonsesÖ[and] reportedly owns half of Hirstís current [December 2009] show in London, at the Wallace Collection.î According to Wallace Collection†release, the exhibition included 25 works. A spokesman for the Pinchuk Art Centre said: ìWe are unable to comment on your request regarding works from the private collection of Victor Pinchuk. To date, in the PinchukArt Centre were held more than 50 individual and group exhibitions, which was attended by about two million people. And the policy of the art center provides a free (free of charge) entry to all visitors. In some exhibitions, namely the Requiem, Sexuality and Transcendence, and Collection Platform were shown Hirst and Koons works from the collection.î Petterson says that since the global economic crisis of 2008, for Hirst and others there have been ìtoo many works and an indigestion problem. The auction market became saturated in 2008 after Hirstís close to $198 million sale at Sothebyís. Since 2009, auction sales have been averaging around $20 million, but with stronger emphasis on the private sales market. The art market is increasingly putting value on works from Hirstís early period (1990s), and collectors are becoming more discerning and selective about what they buy in this market.î He added that it is ìvery rareî for major art transactions to be opened up, and details of the cash or financing to be released. If the value of art works decrease, and art collectors run into financial straits, it would take some time for these news and their implications to be digested by the art market. Javier Lumbreras is chief executive of the Artemundi group, which describes itself as an investment advisor for art as an asset. The group also operates Artemundi Global Fund, ìa Diversified Low-correlated Alternative Investment Vehicle suitable for Portfolio Optimizationî. According to Lumbreras, his group has had a turnover of half a billion dollars; this isnít the same as the value of funds currently under management. That number, according to the fund website, is somewhere between $150 million and $225 million ìto facilitate the purchase of 150-200 works of art.î Lumbreras warns that he is not a keen investor in the type of contemporary art which Pinchuk has been buying.†The fund portfolio†assigns just 3% of its aggregate investment to the Post-War and Contemporary category. ìThe share of Contemporary art is small because it is the most volatile of all art segments, although returns can be extraordinary we are far more prudent in this market.î According to a source at Artemundi Group, the future trajectory for Hirst and Koons is likely to be downwards. ìTheir markets have experienced price bubbles in the last decade, mostly because of price speculation from their main gallerists and some collectors. Tools like price indexes and confidence indexes have confirmed the sudden increase and decrease their prices. In both cases, their prices increased at an extremely fast rate, inflating them to unsustainable levels. When the general market acknowledged this, their prices decreased and returned to their initial value. In Hirstís case, when prices were at its maximum level around 2008, the market experienced an excess on the offer side, making prices collapse in a matter of one year. Koonís price bubble was less pronounced.î What does this mean for the banks lending for purchases of these artists? ìInvestment funds usually perform a thorough due diligence process before investing in an artwork,î the source explains. ìUsually the artistís future price trend is estimated in order to determine if the investment is worth making. If the due diligence process was carried out correctly, funds must have avoided artists like Hirst and Koons because of their market risk. As both artists are alive and working, it is not easy to predict an accurate price tendency because the offer is growing and changing constantly. In the case of owning an artwork from these artists it would seem better to hold it for appreciation until its market stabilizes.î The possibility of bank margin calls can be triggered by sharp declines in value, if the initial financing agreements Pinchuk made when he bought Hirst and Koons included the lenderís fair market valuation. ìThe terms of collateralization and interest rates are usually set using the Fair Market Value [FMV] of the artworks,î according to Artemundi. ìThis is usually calculated by a third party and would appropriately change according to the artistís market tendencies. If an artwork became part of a collateral agreement, usually the FMV of the piece was established within the initial agreement.î In his latest New York†media profile, Koons fails to mention Pinchukís name among his important collectors. The art market media also†indicatethere have been problems documenting actual sales of Koonsís work, and the prices they fetch ó or donít fetch. An art market specialist said that when there is publicity indicating financial trouble for well-known art collections or their owners, the rumour mill quickly starts to speculate on what impact this will have to trigger art disposals. Two recent examples, the source said, are the bankruptcy of Detroit city in the US, and insider trading charges for Steve Cohenís SAC Capital. A London source claims: ìIím not sure if Pinchuk is big enough for his problems to rattle the Hirst market. If he had to sell, the sales would be private, and handled very discreetly.î Another market source said: ìIf people need to sell [Hirst], we are not seeing themî. Hirst and his managers are currently trying to boost demand and prices with a big exhibition scheduled to open shortly†in Qatar. ìIf Pinchuk wants to unload Hirst, there may be buyers in Qatar,î an international dealer believes. Two weeks ago, Pinchuk†invited†a reporter from the Wall Street Journal on board his yacht in the Mediterranean to tell her that his collection of Koons is ìstrongî. ìI am a trained metallurgical engineer, specializing in pipe production,î Pinchuk confided . ìSo I told Jeff that I loved that he cracked this ëEggí because it allowed me to see how thick it is. With pipes, it all comes down to diameter and wall thickness. For the first time with a sculpture, I got to feel both sides of one. You canít do that with a Rodin.î
Morgan StanleyMost market-watchers are currently focused on Friday's jobs report and the Fed's FOMC meeting in two weeks. However, Morgan Stanley's Vincent Reinhart is thinking longer-term in a new note titled "From Resilience to Sustained Expansion." "We think the level of activity is marking an upward inflection point right around now," he wrote. Reinhart is confident that the economy will look much stronger over the next two years. "Four factors support our judgment that real GDP will accelerate to a 2-3/4 percent average growth rate in 2014 and 2015," he wrote. "1) Peak fiscal drag is behind us. 2) We are leaving further behind the financial crisis of 2008-09.¬† 3) Equity price gains, piled atop house-price appreciation, have significantly added to household wealth.¬† 4) As business people see sales expand and expect more, they will pick up the pace of capital spending." Some of Reinhart's confidence is due to the economy's resilience in the face of adversity. "The US economy has traversed a rocky road thus far in 2013," he said. "Obstacles have included significant fiscal drag, concerns about the Fed‚Äôs withdrawal of policy stimulus, and the faltering expansion of key emerging markets.¬† The pace of growth so far may appear unimpressive from a cyclical perspective, but we read the first-half outcome as masking the significant underlying momentum to private spending."
MovieClips / YouTubeNot this gangster.A corpulent thief in China, snitched on his former gang members after they let him go for putting on too much weight, reports Beijing Cream via Young100.cn.  The thief identified as Abu was part of a gang of climbers that robbed third story homes. But Abu reportedly piled on the pounds after spending his loot on food and drinks. The report says his weight surged to 220 pounds, while his accomplices weighed closer to 110 pounds.¬† His new found girth clearly left him without the dexterity he presumably needed to climb and rob homes three floors up, and he was fired. From Beijing Cream: "Left on his own, Abu did not last. On August 22, police found him wandering late one night in a residential area. He was out of breath, and fat. (The article makes sure to mention, once again, he weighed more than 100 kilograms.) In his bag, police found a pipe, a laptop computer, and several mobile phones. He admitted to his crimes, and lamented that he shouldn‚Äôt have eaten so heartily. "A few days later, police discovered a series of third-floor apartments had been robbed. Abu realized it must have been the work of his former gang. Thanks to information that he supplied, authorities were able to capture the criminals, who were indeed Abu‚Äôs old comrades." Apparently, there's no honor among these thieves.
WikimediaIt may seem like architect Rafael ViÒoly, the man who designed the London skyscraper currently melting cars and cooking eggs across the street, †has a monopoly on designing buildings-turned-death-rays. As we just discovered, he's already designed at least two. But he may find some solace knowing that arguably the most famous architect in the world also once put up a "fryscraper." When it opened in fall 2003,†Frank Gehry's Walt Disney Concert Hall was the most important to addition to L.A.'s architectural and cultural landscape in a generation. But by winter of 2004, nearby residents began to notice that it wasn't getting any colder. It was soon discovered that one of Gehry's trademark enormous abstract geometries was concentrating solar radiation into its concave gut and redirecting it onto nearby structures, heating them to as much as 140 degrees. "You couldn't even see and then the furniture would get really hot," Jacqueline Lagrone, 42, who lived on the fourth floor of an apartment complex across the way, told AP. "You would have to literally close the drapes and you'd still feel warmth in the house." Lucky for Gehry, the solution was pretty simple: sandblast the surface of the offending structure into submission.† But that option likely won't be available for ViÒoly†in London , since the glare is coming off of windows, not an ornamental element. Yikes.
APPublic Advocate Bill de Blasio has taken a runoff-proof lead in the Democratic primary race for mayor of New York City, according to a new Quinnipiac University survey released Tuesday.† De Blasio is at 43% in the new poll, his highest standing ever. If he manages to earn that percentage of the vote in next Tuesday's primary, he would avoid a runoff with the second-highest candidate in the Democratic field. He jumped from 36% in last week's Quinnipiac survey.† Former City Comptroller Bill Thompson garners 20% of the vote, the same level he was at last week. City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, meanwhile, has slipped to 18% ó her lowest standing in the poll. She is down from her 21% standing in last week's poll. Much-maligned candidate Anthony Weiner gets only 7% of the vote. What's crucial for de Blasio is his incredible standing with black and women voters ó two groups that have trended from Thompson and Quinn, respectively, to de Blasio.† De Blasio leads with 47% of the black vote, nearly doubling Thompson's share. And among women voters, de Blasio grabs 44% of the vote, compared with Thompson's 19% and Quinn's 18%. Even if a runoff were to occur, de Blasio doesn't look like he has anything to worry about. Here are the runoff scores between the top-three candidates: Here's a chart that shows de Blasio's incredible rise: Quinnipiac University

Google FinanceInvestors and traders are back from their three-day weekends. Initially they bid stocks up, sending the Dow up by as much as 122 points. But now the Dow is in the red. This comes after a wave of international PMI reports signaled that the world economy was still growing. In the U.S., the ISM manufacturing index surged to 55.7 in August, the highest level since June 2011. However, the employment sub-index actually fell.
IanMurphy via www.flickr.com creative commonsAs a¬†financial planner, I can tell which¬†investments¬†are probably best for my clients before we even talk about¬†money.¬† How is that possible? It's pretty straight-forward, actually. I don't¬†mean¬†to suggest that I know which¬†investment¬†strategy to take before they even come into my office. Rather, as we talk about their lives, I get a sense for their personality. And personality is an indicator of your¬†investment¬†strategy. Everything that we do in life is an extension of our personality, from our vacation¬†spot¬†to our career. For example, when people are very conservative by nature, they probably don't want to take a¬†lot¬†of risk (if any) when it comes to their¬†investments. Conservative people are conservative investors -- they like knowing what to expect and they don't like surprises.¬† I have a client who is never¬†open¬†to change. He doesn't like to take risks on anything¬† -- especially his investments. He likes the security of knowing that everything is the same, and he never wants to hear about new products. I don't need to meet with him more than once a¬†year¬†because we don't need to make changes to or revise his investment portfolio -- he just needs to be reassured that his¬†money¬†is still there. Meanwhile, if a person is very organized and in control of everything in her life, her investment portfolio is likely the same way. I have a client who is borderline obsessive compulsive about everything being scheduled. She comes to see me every third Wednesday of the month at 1 p.m. on the dot. I know that she likes to be in control; she has to have calm in her life. So I let her take control of the conversation. I make investment suggestions, but ultimately she makes the decision. The truth is that the meeting is just a formality; she already knows what she wants before she comes into my office. Then there's the client who always talks to me about her home -- it's her pride and joy. Every time she comes to see me she has a new recipe or decorating tip for my apartment. She also likes to share statistics on germs in homes and offices. My client keeps her home immaculate and she wants her investment portfolio the same way. This client requires financial planning by the book. She doesn't want to have several different investments because it creates a multi-page statement and (in her mind) financial messiness. Her investment portfolio is well diversified among¬†cash, fixed¬†income¬†investments and domestic¬†equity. However, she does not have several types of investments in each¬†asset class; there is just one -- maybe two mutual¬†funds¬†per category -- and that's the way she likes it. Clean and simple. The¬†Investing¬†Answer:¬†Personality is an indicator, but your¬†financial planner¬†needs more from you. Visit your¬†financial advisor¬†at least once a year to make sure that your investment options are in line with your current goals. Also, prepare questions about your investment options to make sure that when you walk out of the office, you are comfortable and confident with your investment choices.¬† It's also a good idea to have all of your statements in hand so that you can compare and discuss the performance of your investment portfolio with your financial advisor.
Rafael ViÒoly, the Uruguayan-born architect who designed the new London building that's now frying eggs across the street because of its intense reflection, is the same architect who designed another notorious "fry-scraper" in Las Vegas years ago. In 2010, guests of ViÒoly's†Vdara Hotel and Spa at MGM's Aria began complaining of severe burns from the glare being reflected off the building's facade. "It felt like I had a chemical burn. I couldn't imagine why my head was burning,"†the Daily Mail quoted one lawyer as saying. "Within 30 seconds, the back of my legs were burning. My first thought was, 'Jesus, they destroyed the ozone layer!'" ViÒoly's website boasts of Vdara's †"slender profile and curvature, which responds to Harmon Circle and the interlocking arcs of the ARIA hotel complex located across the shared circular drive. Three parallel, offset arcs rising to varying heights comprise the crescent-shaped skyscraper." Similar curvature is being blamed for the current situation in London. The Mail went on to report that†ViÒoly "foresaw the issue with the reflecting sun but thought they had solved it by installing a high-tech film on the south-facing panes of glass," but that an MGM spokesman had conceded the measures fell short. We just got the following comment on the London situation, but are awaiting further clarification on how a repeat occurred: A joint statement from Land Securities and Canary Wharf on 20 Fenchurch Street: "We are taking the issue of light reflecting from 20 Fenchurch Street seriously, and are looking into the matter as a priority. "The phenomenon is caused by the current elevation of the sun in the sky. It currently lasts for approximately 2 hours per day, with initial modeling suggesting that it will be present for approximately 2-3 weeks. "As responsible developers we are making every effort to keep local businesses informed and we have communicated with them regularly since the issue first appeared. While we investigate the situation further we have liaised with the City of London to suspend three parking bays in the area which may be affected. "In addition, we are consulting with local businesses and the City to address the issue in the short-term, while also evaluating longer-term solutions to ensure the issue cannot recur in future."
Since 2009, the percentage of Americans who pay no federal income taxes has fallen from 47% to 43%, according to a recent report by the Tax Policy Center.†The catalyst for the drop is due to two factors ó federal tax cuts that expired after the Great Recession and an improving economy.† These charts from the TCP †break down exactly who the 43% are:†† Last year,†TPCís 2009 estimate†might have been the nail in the coffin for Mitt Romney's ill-fated bid for the Presidency after he criticized the "47%" of Americans who don't pay federal income taxes at a fundraiser.† Like Romney, a lot of people assumed that these households were getting off tax-free across the board. That wasn't the case then and it's certainly not the case now.† "The notoriety of the 47 percent figure has come largely from a misunderstandingóor less charitably, a misrepresentationóof what that number actually means," writes Robert Williams of the TCP.† Thanks to payroll taxes, it's nearly impossible to get away completely tax-free today. In fact, "just 14%†of households pay neither income nor payroll tax and two-thirds of them are elderly," according to the TCP. And then there are taxes closer to home to consider. You'd be hard-pressed to find households who don't get hit with state or local†income, sales, and property taxes.† Of the 43% of households owing no federal income tax this year, about half simply earned too little income to qualify, including many retired workers who live on Social Security. The remaining households likely qualify for breaks via the†Earned Income Tax Credit†and the†Child Tax Credit.† This year, the TCP put together a helpful video breaking down the 43%:†  Looking ahead, the TCP estimates that the number of workers who pay no federal income taxes will continue to fall, reaching just 33% by the year 2024.

ShutterstockWhat do hedge funds do, and how do they make money? These are questions everyone wants answers to. And most people would like those answers to not be too technical. Reddit user gadela08 who claims to be a hedge fund insider provides a brief, crystal clear explanation of how hedge funds operate. 1) On securities research and analysis Here are the Redditor's key points: That last bullet includes testing legal limitations. Here's exactly what the Redditor said (emphasis added): We maintain open contact with over 40 different brokers in various markets. Every day, these guys send me hundreds of emails and text messages over bloomberg telling me as much as they legally can about what kind of flows they're seeing. When they buy a large block of securities from a client, they let me know what they just bought and offer me a structured trade for those products so they clear the risk off their books. sometimes they call me to tell me interesting or urgent news about a particular trade that i currently have on that I may have missed in the news that morning. This gives you a sense of how the big players can have an edge over mom-and-pop. 2) On the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) The EMH more or less argues that the all available information is already priced into the market. And therefore, it is basically impossible to beat the market. However, many dispute this theory and believe it's a mistake to take it too seriously. Another Redditor identified six ways a trader could theoretically take advantage of inefficiencies. We paraphrase here. Again, all this just goes to show that mom-and-pop are likely to have a disadvantage relative to the big players. Read the whole thread at Reddit.
Years of easy financial conditions have pushed China into a¬†self-imposed deleveraging cycle. In the post-crisis years, China's heavy investment into state-run infrastructure and real estate projects (at the expense of the private sector) fueled "sectoral overcapacity and potential financial stability risks," writes Morgan Stanley economist¬†Helen Qiao in a new note to clients. Though it must stomach¬† deleveraging's bitter pill,¬†China can still set itself up for long-term growth, Qiao writes. Here's how: 1. Raise productivity "Before households can change saving patterns to increase consumption (with the help of a strong social security safety net and healthcare benefits), China urgently needs to calibrate the direction of investment to increase its return," according to Qiao. 2. Promote the private sector Qiao writes that China's current policy of "guo jin min tui" (the state advances while the private sector retreats) needs to be replaced with "guo tui min jin" (the private sector advances while the state retreats). Qiao notes that Chinese policymakers have shown they are willing to implement structural adjustments here. "The recent shift towards a more pro-growth stance suggests the administration recognizes the importance of macro stability and will aim to prevent tail-risk events," she writes. 3. Introduce short-term policy measures to limit downside risks "Our analysis of the previous deleveraging experience in the 1990s suggests greater caution should be used on the pace and intensity of major policy changes if aggregate demand is weak," Qiao writes. "In addition, an adequate policy cushion to supplement the reform measures is warranted to prevent a hard landing, in our view." In the past, China's sweeping economic reforms have resulted from widespread instability. That doesn't have to be the case this time, Qiao argues. China shouldn't look for a "silver bullet" reform, writes Qiao, but should instead implement "many silver needles, in an¬†acupuncture-style reform."
Earlier, we presented a big run-down of the state of the world economy showing how countries have been performing of late according to their newly released August purchasing managers index (PMI) reports. Deutsche Bank just published a chart that captures all of that in a single image. Any country above the dotted line is improving at an accelerating pace. As you can see, the developed economies are trouncing the developing ones. This also happened to be echoed this morning by the OECD, which revised its year-end GDP projections for almost all major European economies upward. Here are four key takeaways from Deutsche Bank: Check it out: Deutsche Bank
Ajay Verma / REUTERSOne of my favorite books is "Making†Money" by Terry Pratchett. In it, a former con man, Moist von Lipwig, is†put†in charge of the mint by the city's benevolent dictator. He is opposed by the head clerk of the bank, Mr. Bent -- who is all about the virtue of gold. Mr. Bent insists that acurrency†must be backed by gold in order to be truly legit.† On the other hand, Moist believes that it's OK to print†money. And as long as it goes 'round and 'round, everything†will†be fine -- whether or not there's actual gold in the bank's vault. Among the most interesting insights, though, comes during an exchange about the relative value of gold. †Gold Isn't "Real Money" Moist points out that on a desert island, gold is basically useless. You can't eat it. You can't plant it. A potato, though, can be eaten. Part of it can be planted to grow more potatoes. When you're starving, gold suddenly isn't so valuable.† Just like everything else, the value of gold is in how it's perceived.This is true in the "real" world as well. Anyone watching the rollercoaster ride that has been gold prices for the last†year†or two knows that gold's value changes on whims -- just like everything else.Even though, for thousands of years, gold has been considered a valuable medium of exchange, the reality it is that it's really not "pure money." Although there are states that accept gold and silver as legal tender in addition to†Federal Reserve notes, owning precious metals in physical form might not be all that great.In fact, in June 2013, Henry Blodget pointed out that gold is just as susceptible to the whims of themarket†as any other†investment. He pointed out that gold has no true fundamental value: "But there's no solid theoretical way to 'value' gold, so its price could do almost anything." Later, he continued: "Speculating about what gold prices†will†do is speculating, not†investing..."As he points out, gold is "just yellow metal." There isn't anything particularly special about it, and if a financial apocalypse does come, would you rather have food storage and good land or a safe full of gold coins? Who's going to want to trade for your gold -- and who would be able to afford it, anyway? It goes back to that whole potatoes vs. gold thing.There are other†downsides†associated with†investing†in the physical form of gold.† 28%†Tax†Rate!! Physical gold is taxed at the collectibles†capital†gains†rate, which is 28% as of this writing. It doesn't matter what†income†bracket you're in. Forms of gold taxed at this rate include wafers, bars, coins and rounds, as well as certificate gold, electronic gold and gold†ETFs. The High Cost Of Storage You need to figure out how to store it. You either need a secure location in your home, or you need to pay someone to store it for you. Finding someone to store it for you often means that you add to your†overhead, cutting into your returns, since you have to pay monthly or yearly fees. Gold†ETFscan reduce the need for storage, but they still come with the collectibles†capital†gains†rate. (Plus, with gold ETFs you do have to worry about†contango. This occurs when the current†futures†price of anasset†-- as quoted in the†futures market†-- is higher than the current†spot price†of the†underlying asset. Check out†our definition†to learn more.) By the time you pay a premium for buying physical gold, and then pay for its storage (or shipment to you), it's a little hard to make a†profit.The†Investing†Answer:†Don't get too hung up on physical gold. Be realistic about the drawbacks involved. If you really must have exposure to gold, consider starting with gold†stocks†(which are taxed as "regular" capital gains). You can also judiciously buy physical gold in small quantities for diversity, or you can begin building a tax-free heirloom collection of fine gold jewelry.†But don't expect it to save you from financial apocalypse, and don't believe that it's "pure money" that somehow isn't subject to perception and market forces.

REUTERS/Gus RuelasEconomist Nouriel Roubini, known as much for his doom and gloom forecasts as he is for his love of partying, is being forced to remove the giant hot tub from his Manhattan penthouse, according to the New York Post.  Department of Buildings spokesman Kelly Magee told New York Post's Page Six: "The department inspected in response to a complaint on 2/5/13 and issued a violation for operating the roof contrary to its approved use. The roof is approved for use as a terrace according to the building‚Äôs certificate of occupancy." New York Magazine describes Roubini's Tribeca party pad as a "a vagina-walled downtown loft." This after blogger Julia Allison posted photos¬†on her blog and took them down after Roubini requested she do so to maintain his privacy. Roubini has previously said that he is a "rock star among geeks, wonks, and nerds," and that at his parties he looks for a ratio of "ten girls to one guy."

Wikimedia CommonsThis morning, we learned that the closely watched ISM manufacturing index unexpectedly jumped to 55.7 in August from 55.4 in July.† This was the highest reading since 2011. However, there was one detail that was less than great: jobs. "The Employment Index registered 53.3 percent, a decrease of 1.1 percentage points compared to July's reading of 54.4 percent," wrote the ISM in its release this morning. While a reading above 50 signals growth, the decline suggests deceleration. This is something economists will pine over ahead of this Friday's big jobs report. ISM
ISM manufacturing climbed to 55.7 in August, up from 55.4 in July. Consensus was for 54.0. It's the highest reading since June 2011. Production and employment expansion both slowed. It's actually been a mixed bag since 2011, according to this chart from Econoday, but it looks like we're back on track: Econoday Full release: The report was issued today by Bradley J. Holcomb, CPSM, CPSD, chair of the Institute for Supply Management‚Ñ¢ Manufacturing Business Survey Committee. "The PMI‚Ñ¢ registered 55.7 percent, an increase of 0.3 percentage point from July's reading of 55.4 percent. August's PMI‚Ñ¢ reading, the highest of the year, indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector for the third consecutive month. The New Orders Index increased in August by 4.9 percentage points to 63.2 percent, and the Production Index decreased by 2.6 percentage points to 62.4 percent. The Employment Index registered 53.3 percent, a decrease of 1.1 percentage points compared to July's reading of 54.4 percent. The Prices Index registered 54 percent, increasing 5 percentage points from July, indicating that overall raw materials prices increased when compared to last month. Comments from the panel range from slow to improving business conditions depending upon the industry." Of the 18 manufacturing industries, 15 are reporting growth in August in the following order: Textile Mills; Wood Products; Electrical Equipment, Appliances &amp; Components; Food, Beverage &amp; Tobacco Products; Nonmetallic Mineral Products; Plastics &amp; Rubber Products; Computer &amp; Electronic Products; Printing &amp; Related Support Activities; Furniture &amp; Related Products; Primary Metals; Fabricated Metal Products; Transportation Equipment; Machinery; Chemical Products; and Paper Products. The only industry reporting contraction in August is Miscellaneous Manufacturing. *Number of months moving in current direction. ¬† Corrugated Boxes (13); Corrugated Packaging (4); Lumber; Oil (2); Oil Based Products (2); Plastic Resin (2); Polypropylene (3); Steel ‚Äî Cold Rolled; and Steel ‚Äî Hot Rolled (2). Corn; Stainless Steel Surcharges; Steel (5); Sugar (4); and Sulfuric Acid. No commodities are listed in short supply. Note: The number of consecutive months the commodity is listed is indicated after each item. ¬† Manufacturing expanded in August as the PMI‚Ñ¢ registered 55.7 percent, an increase of 0.3 percentage point when compared to July's reading of 55.4 percent. August's reading reflects the highest overall PMI‚Ñ¢ reading in 2013. A reading above 50 percent indicates that the manufacturing economy is generally expanding; below 50 percent indicates that it is generally contracting. A PMI‚Ñ¢ in excess of 42.2 percent, over a period of time, generally indicates an expansion of the overall economy. Therefore, the August PMI‚Ñ¢ indicates growth for the 51st consecutive month in the overall economy, and indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector for the third consecutive month. Holcomb stated, "The past relationship between the PMI‚Ñ¢ and the overall economy indicates that the average PMI‚Ñ¢ for January through August (52.5 percent) corresponds to a 3.2 percent increase in real gross domestic product (GDP) on an annualized basis. In addition, if the PMI‚Ñ¢ for August (55.7 percent) is annualized, it corresponds to a 4.2 percent increase in real GDP annually." ¬† ISM's New Orders Index registered 63.2 percent in August, an increase of 4.9 percentage points when compared to the July reading of 58.3 percent. This represents growth in new orders for the third consecutive month, and is also the highest reading for the index since April 2011, when the index registered 63.8 percent. A New Orders Index above 52.2 percent, over time, is generally consistent with an increase in the Census Bureau's series on manufacturing orders (in constant 2000 dollars). The 12 industries reporting growth in new orders in August ‚Äî listed in order ‚Äî are: Textile Mills; Wood Products; Nonmetallic Mineral Products; Computer &amp; Electronic Products; Furniture &amp; Related Products; Food, Beverage &amp; Tobacco Products; Plastics &amp; Rubber Products; Electrical Equipment, Appliances &amp; Components; Chemical Products; Fabricated Metal Products; Transportation Equipment; and Paper Products. The only industry reporting a decrease in new orders during August is Miscellaneous Manufacturing. ¬† ISM's Production Index registered 62.4 percent in August, which is a decrease of 2.6 percentage points when compared to the 65 percent reported in July. This month's reading indicates growth in production for the third consecutive month. An index above 51.2 percent, over time, is generally consistent with an increase in the Federal Reserve Board's Industrial Production figures. The 15 industries reporting growth in production during the month of August ‚Äî listed in order ‚Äî are: Textile Mills; Electrical Equipment, Appliances &amp; Components; Wood Products; Plastics &amp; Rubber Products; Nonmetallic Mineral Products; Food, Beverage &amp; Tobacco Products; Primary Metals; Printing &amp; Related Support Activities; Computer &amp; Electronic Products; Paper Products; Fabricated Metal Products; Furniture &amp; Related Products; Chemical Products; Machinery; and Transportation Equipment. The only industry reporting a decrease in production in August is Miscellaneous Manufacturing. ¬† ISM's Employment Index registered 53.3 percent in August, which is 1.1 percentage points lower than the 54.4 percent reported in July. This month's reading indicates expansion in employment for the second consecutive month. An Employment Index above 50.5 percent, over time, is generally consistent with an increase in the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data on manufacturing employment. Of the 18 manufacturing industries, seven reported growth in employment in August in the following order: Wood Products; Plastics &amp; Rubber Products; Food, Beverage &amp; Tobacco Products; Printing &amp; Related Support Activities; Furniture &amp; Related Products; Fabricated Metal Products; and Electrical Equipment, Appliances &amp; Components. The four industries reporting a decrease in employment in August are: Apparel, Leather &amp; Allied Products; Primary Metals; Chemical Products; and Miscellaneous Manufacturing. Seven industries reported no change in employment in August compared to July. ¬† The delivery performance of suppliers to manufacturing organizations slowed in August at a slightly faster rate relative to July as the Supplier Deliveries Index registered 52.3 percent. This month's reading is 0.2 percentage point higher than the 52.1 percent reported in July. A reading below 50 percent indicates faster deliveries, while a reading above 50 percent indicates slower deliveries. The eight industries reporting slower supplier deliveries in August ‚Äî listed in order ‚Äî are: Textile Mills; Wood Products; Primary Metals; Electrical Equipment, Appliances &amp; Components; Fabricated Metal Products; Food, Beverage &amp; Tobacco Products; Machinery; and Chemical Products. The three industries reporting faster supplier deliveries in August are: Plastics &amp; Rubber Products; Paper Products; and Computer &amp; Electronic Products. Seven industries reported no change in supplier deliveries in August compared to July. ¬† The Inventories Index registered 47.5 percent in August, which is 0.5 percentage point higher than the 47 percent reported in July. This month's reading indicates that respondents are reporting inventories contracted in August for the second consecutive month. For the first eight months of 2013, inventories of raw materials have registered in a well-managed range from a high of 51.5 percent in February to a low of 46.5 percent in April. An Inventories Index greater than 42.7 percent, over time, is generally consistent with expansion in the Bureau of Economic Analysis' (BEA) figures on overall manufacturing inventories (in chained 2000 dollars). The five industries reporting higher inventories in August are: Apparel, Leather &amp; Allied Products; Computer &amp; Electronic Products; Transportation Equipment; Electrical Equipment, Appliances &amp; Components; and Machinery. The nine industries reporting decreases in inventories in August ‚Äî listed in order ‚Äî are: Wood Products; Textile Mills; Plastics &amp; Rubber Products; Fabricated Metal Products; Primary Metals; Paper Products; Furniture &amp; Related Products; Chemical Products; and Miscellaneous Manufacturing. ¬† The ISM Customers' Inventories Index registered 42.5 percent in August, which is 5 percentage points lower than in July when the index registered 47.5 percent. This month's reading indicates that customers' inventories are considered too low, and significantly lower than reported in July. Customers' inventories have registered at or below 50 percent for 53 consecutive months. A reading below 50 percent indicates customers' inventories are considered too low. The only manufacturing industry reporting customers' inventories as being too high during the month of August is Apparel, Leather &amp; Allied Products. The 10 industries reporting customers' inventories as too low during August ‚Äî listed in order ‚Äî are: Textile Mills; Primary Metals; Miscellaneous Manufacturing; Transportation Equipment; Electrical Equipment, Appliances &amp; Components; Food, Beverage &amp; Tobacco Products; Machinery; Computer &amp; Electronic Products; Fabricated Metal Products; and Plastics &amp; Rubber Products. Seven industries reported no change in customers' inventories in August compared to July. ¬† The ISM Prices Index registered 54 percent in August, which is an increase of 5 percentage points compared to the July reading of 49 percent. The Prices Index has alternated between price increases and price decreases for the last four months, with August indicating an increase in the price of raw materials. In August, 21 percent of respondents reported paying higher prices, 13 percent reported paying lower prices, and 66 percent of supply executives reported paying the same prices as in July. A Prices Index above 49.7 percent, over time, is generally consistent with an increase in the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Index of Manufacturers Prices. Of the 18 manufacturing industries, nine reported paying increased prices during the month of August in the following order: Textile Mills; Wood Products; Apparel, Leather &amp; Allied Products; Fabricated Metal Products; Plastics &amp; Rubber Products; Miscellaneous Manufacturing; Chemical Products; Machinery; and Computer &amp; Electronic Products. The six industries reporting paying lower prices during August ‚Äî listed in order ‚Äî are: Petroleum &amp; Coal Products; Electrical Equipment, Appliances &amp; Components; Paper Products; Transportation Equipment; Printing &amp; Related Support Activities; and Food, Beverage &amp; Tobacco Products. ¬† ISM's Backlog of Orders Index registered 46.5 percent in August, which is 1.5 percentage points higher than the 45 percent reported in July. This is the fourth consecutive month of contracting order backlogs. Of the 85 percent of respondents who reported their backlog of orders, 16 percent reported greater backlogs, 23 percent reported smaller backlogs, and 61 percent reported no change from July. The four industries reporting increased order backlogs in August are: Apparel, Leather &amp; Allied Products; Computer &amp; Electronic Products; Furniture &amp; Related Products; and Machinery. The eight industries reporting decreases in order backlogs during August ‚Äî listed in order ‚Äî are: Primary Metals; Plastics &amp; Rubber Products; Miscellaneous Manufacturing; Fabricated Metal Products; Chemical Products; Transportation Equipment; Paper Products; and Food, Beverage &amp; Tobacco Products. Six industries reported no change in order backlogs in August compared to July. ¬† ISM's New Export Orders Index registered 55.5 percent in August, which is 2 percentage points higher than the 53.5 percent reported in July. This month's reading represents the ninth consecutive month of growth in new export orders. The eight industries reporting growth in new export orders in August ‚Äî listed in order ‚Äî are: Wood Products; Apparel, Leather &amp; Allied Products; Fabricated Metal Products; Petroleum &amp; Coal Products; Machinery; Computer &amp; Electronic Products; Electrical Equipment, Appliances &amp; Components; and Chemical Products. The four industries reporting a decrease in new export orders during August are: Paper Products; Miscellaneous Manufacturing; Transportation Equipment; and Food, Beverage &amp; Tobacco Products. Six industries reported no change in new export orders in August compared to July. ¬† ISM's Imports Index registered 58 percent in August, which is 0.5 percentage point higher than the 57.5 percent reported in July. August's reading reflects the highest level of imports since April 2010, when the reading was also 58 percent. This month's reading also represents the ninth consecutive month that the Imports Index has registered at or above 50 percent. The 10 industries reporting growth in imports during the month of August ‚Äî listed in order ‚Äî are: Wood Products; Primary Metals; Computer &amp; Electronic Products; Food, Beverage &amp; Tobacco Products; Fabricated Metal Products; Machinery; Furniture &amp; Related Products; Chemical Products; Transportation Equipment; and Electrical Equipment, Appliances &amp; Components. The only industry reporting a decrease in imports during August is Apparel, Leather &amp; Allied Products. Seven industries reported no change in imports in August compared to July. ¬† * The Inventories, Customers' Inventories, Prices, Backlog of Orders, New Export Orders and Imports Indexes do not meet the accepted criteria for seasonal adjustments. Average commitment lead time for Capital Expenditures increased 3 days to 124 days. Average lead time for Production Materials decreased 4 days to 59 days. Average lead time for Maintenance, Repair and Operating (MRO) Supplies decreased 1 day to 26 days. ¬† The data presented herein is obtained from a survey of manufacturing supply managers based on information they have collected within their respective organizations. ISM makes no representation, other than that stated within this release, regarding the individual company data collection procedures. Use of the data is in the public domain and should be compared to all other economic data sources when used in decision-making. The¬†Manufacturing ISM¬†Report On Business¬Æ¬†is based on data compiled from purchasing and supply executives nationwide. Membership of the Manufacturing Business Survey Committee is diversified by NAICS, based on each industry's contribution to gross domestic product (GDP). Manufacturing Business Survey Committee responses are divided into the following NAICS code categories: Food, Beverage &amp; Tobacco Products; Textile Mills; Apparel, Leather &amp; Allied Products; Wood Products; Paper Products; Printing &amp; Related Support Activities; Petroleum &amp; Coal Products; Chemical Products; Plastics &amp; Rubber Products; Nonmetallic Mineral Products; Primary Metals; Fabricated Metal Products; Machinery; Computer &amp; Electronic Products; Electrical Equipment, Appliances &amp; Components; Transportation Equipment; Furniture &amp; Related Products; and Miscellaneous Manufacturing (products such as medical equipment and supplies, jewelry, sporting goods, toys and office supplies). Survey responses reflect the change, if any, in the current month compared to the previous month. For each of the indicators measured (New Orders, Backlog of Orders, New Export Orders, Imports, Production, Supplier Deliveries, Inventories, Customers' Inventories, Employment and Prices), this report shows the percentage reporting each response, the net difference between the number of responses in the positive economic direction (higher, better and slower for Supplier Deliveries) and the negative economic direction (lower, worse and faster for Supplier Deliveries), and the diffusion index. Responses are raw data and are never changed. The diffusion index includes the percent of positive responses plus one-half of those responding the same (considered positive). The resulting single index number for those meeting the criteria for seasonal adjustments (PMI‚Ñ¢, New Orders, Production, Employment and Supplier Deliveries) is then seasonally adjusted to allow for the effects of repetitive intra-year variations resulting primarily from normal differences in weather conditions, various institutional arrangements, and differences attributable to non-moveable holidays. All seasonal adjustment factors are supplied by the U.S. Department of Commerce and are subject annually to relatively minor changes when conditions warrant them. The PMI‚Ñ¢ is a composite index based on the diffusion indexes of five of the indexes with equal weights: New Orders (seasonally adjusted), Production (seasonally adjusted), Employment (seasonally adjusted), Supplier Deliveries (seasonally adjusted), and Inventories. Diffusion indexes have the properties of leading indicators and are convenient summary measures showing the prevailing direction of change and the scope of change. A PMI‚Ñ¢ reading above 50 percent indicates that the manufacturing economy is generally expanding; below 50 percent indicates that it is generally declining. A PMI‚Ñ¢ in excess of 42.2 percent, over a period of time, indicates that the overall economy, or gross domestic product (GDP), is generally expanding; below 42.2 percent, it is generally declining. The distance from 50 percent or 42.2 percent is indicative of the strength of the expansion or decline. With some of the indicators within this report, ISM has indicated the departure point between expansion and decline of comparable government series, as determined by regression analysis. The¬†Manufacturing ISM¬†Report On Business¬Æ¬†survey is sent out to Manufacturing Business Survey Committee respondents the first part of each month. Respondents are asked to ONLY report on information for the current month. ISM receives survey responses throughout most of any given month, with the majority of respondents generally waiting until late in the month to submit responses in order to give the most accurate picture of current business activity. ISM then compiles the report for release on the first business day of the following month. The industries reporting growth, as indicated in the¬†Manufacturing ISM¬†Report On Business¬Æ¬†monthly report, are listed in the order of most growth to least growth. For the industries reporting contraction or decreases, those are listed in the order of the highest level of contraction/decrease to the least level of contraction/decrease. Responses to Buying Policy reflect the percent reporting the current month's lead time, the approximate weighted number of days ahead for which commitments are made for Production Materials; Capital Expenditures; and Maintenance, Repair and Operating (MRO) Supplies, expressed as hand-to-mouth (five days), 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, six months (180 days), a year or more (360 days), and the weighted average number of days. These responses are raw data, never revised, and not seasonally adjusted since there is no significant seasonal pattern. The¬†Manufacturing ISM¬†Report On Business¬Æ¬†is published monthly by the Institute for Supply Management‚Ñ¢, the first supply institute in the world. Founded in 1915, ISM exists to lead and serve the supply management profession and is a highly influential and respected association in the global marketplace. ISM's mission is to enhance the value and performance of procurement and supply chain management practitioners and their organizations worldwide. This report has been issued by the association since 1931, except for a four-year interruption during World War II. The full text version of the¬†Manufacturing ISM¬†Report On Business¬Æ¬†is posted on ISM's website at www.ism.ws on the first business day of every month after 10:10 a.m. (ET). The next¬†Manufacturing ISM¬†Report On Business¬Æ¬†featuring the September 2013 data will be released at 10:00 a.m. (ET) on Tuesday, October 1, 2013.
Library of CongressThe truth may make you sick. Technically, it's public knowledge, but I can tell you -- it's Congress' dirty little secret. Congress is rich. Unbelievably rich. And until just recently,¬†insider trading¬†laws didn't apply to Congress. I don't know which is worse: The fact that insider trading was legal for some of our nation's wealthiest politicians... or that Congress refused to do anything about it for decades. "A few lawmakers proposed a bill that would prevent members and employees of Congress from trading securities based on nonpublic information they obtain. The legislation has languished since 2006," according to The¬†Wall Street¬†Journal. That was, the legislation languished until "60 Minutes" -- one of the most respected investigative journalism programs on television -- dedicated a segment to the¬†issue. Here's a portion of what they had to say... "In mid-September 2008, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average still above 10,000, Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman¬†Ben Bernanke¬†were holding closed-door briefings with congressional leaders and privately warning them that a global financial meltdown could occur within a few days. One of those attending was Alabama Rep. Spencer Bachus, then the ranking Republican member on the House Financial Services Committee and now its chairman. "While Congressman Bachus was publicly trying to keep the¬†economy¬†from cratering, he was privately betting that it would, buying¬†option¬†funds¬†that would go up in value if the¬†market¬†went down. He would make a variety of trades and profited at a time when most Americans were losing their shirts." And that was just one example. Also dug up by "60 Minutes:" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and her husband have participated in¬†multipleexclusive IPOs -- including that of¬†Visa (NYSE:¬†V). According to one report, Pelosi purchased 5,000¬†shares¬†of Visa at the¬†IPO¬†price of $44. Just a couple of days later, when the¬†stock¬†was trading to the¬†investing¬†public, it traded at $64 per share. Current House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, bought¬†stocks¬†in health-care companies days before the so-called¬†public option¬†was pulled from the legislation. The removal of the public option proved to be a boon for private health insurers, making a significant sum for Boehner's¬†investments. The report from "60 Minutes" led to a frenzy. And a few months after the story aired, the STOCK Act, which curbed insider trading by Congress, was signed into law. But why was it delayed for so long? Apparently Congress was making too much¬†money¬†off the lax rules to do anything about it. According to data from the Center for Responsive Politics,¬†249 of the 535 members of Congress are millionaires. That's 47%.¬†For comparison, about 5% of American households are worth more than $1 million. So much for representation "by the people." And why on earth would Congress change rules that have obviously helped them for decades? Thankfully, the STOCK Act strengthened financial reporting requirements for members of Congress (along with some of their higher-paid aides). Not only did it eliminate insider trading, but it said Congress must now disclose their trades within 45 days after they happen. That means we have an opportunity to see exactly what our "representatives" are buying. And we need to know... In a study cited by Barron's,¬†members of the House of Representatives beat investors like you and me by 55¬†basis points¬†a month. That comes out to an extra 6.8% per¬†year. I think Barron's said it best... "To give an indication of what House members' outperformance is worth, investing at the stock market's long-term total return of 10% would¬†mean¬†$10,000 would grow to $25,937 in 10 years. But with their special¬†investment¬†acumen, their 16.8% annual returns would leave them with $47,253 in 10 years." With that in mind, I decided to dive in and see just exactly what the most popular investments are with Congress... The 10 Most Popular Stocks in Congress I'll be honest -- the most popular stocks held by Congress aren't some super-secret investments. They aren't exclusive investments owned only by those in Congress with some inside knowledge of a future breakthrough. Instead, they're large multinational corporations that make up the bulk of many average investors' portfolios. I won't keep you in suspense...  This data is provided by the Center for Responsive Politics. The most recent year available was 2011, before the STOCK Act passed. As I said above, Barron's cited a study that suggests members of Congress post returns much better than average investors. If their most popular holdings are similar to what many investors own, how is it that Congress can earn such higher returns? No one can say for sure, but my research is turning up a few clues. For starters,¬†every single one of these stocks pay a¬†dividend. As I explained to InvestingAnswers readers¬†last month, a 29-year study by Ned Davis Research found that dividend-paying S&amp;P 500 stocks returned 8.6% annually from 1972 through 2011, while non-dividend payers returned just 1.4% annually over the same stretch. But perhaps a more important thing to¬†note¬†is the length of time that these representatives have held onto these stocks. If you check out the 10 most popular stocks owned by Congress five years ago, eight of them are on the list today. And the two not on the list are in the top 25 today. So is it that members of Congress are just holding on to stocks longer? That's what I think, but let me explain why... In 1940, the average¬†holding period¬†for an investment was seven years, according to William Hutchings of the Financial News. By 2007,¬†that period had shrunk to just five days. But you don't have to trade every day... or every week... or even every year to beat the market. In fact, your success actually increases the fewer trades you make and the longer you hold. A recent study by mega-investment firm Oppenheimer showed that the S&amp;P 500 has NEVER suffered a loss in a 20-year period (measured in rolling monthly periods), dating all the way back to 1950. Of course, we all know you can't say the same for holding stocks for a year or two. When you hold stocks for a short period of time, your odds of losing money are much, much higher. And you can lose a boatload of money in a hurry... In fact, in its worst one-year period, the S&amp;P 500 dropped 44.8%. No wonder¬†Warren Buffett¬†has always said his favorite holding period is "forever." I think these shorter holding periods for average investors are hurting their returns. So yes, it appears Congress is buying many of the same well-known stocks as everyday investors.The difference is, they're holding onto their stocks longer than regular investors. It was with this thought in mind a few months ago that I had StreetAuthority's research team update our report on¬†"The 10 Best Stocks to Hold Forever."¬†Put¬†simply, these are reliable stocks you can¬†buy and hold¬†practically "forever" while you watch the profits roll in -- the same way members of Congress have done it to become¬†wealthy¬†over time. Since first releasing this report, our 10 Forever Stocks have returned on average 40% over the last two years. My longtime readers have heard me talk about some of these stocks before. In fact, a few of the names (including Cisco and Intel) that are widely owned by members of Congress are featured in our list of Forever Stocks. And while it's no secret that members of Congress invest in several "brand-name" stocks that are worth holding forever, some of our Forever Stocks are ones that few mainstream investors even know exist. Not to mention eight out of 10 of these "Forever" stocks pay a dividend -- with yields of 3.8%, 6.1% or higher. If you're interested in learning more about these "Forever Stocks," I invite you to watch¬†this short presentation.
Reuters/Gary CameronConstruction spending beat expectations rising 0.6% in July. Economists polled by Bloomberg were looking a 0.4% month-over-month rise. Meanwhile, June's number was revised up to reflect construction spending stayed flat, compared with an initial print that showed a 0.6% fall. Overall residential spending was up 0.5% on the month,a nd 16.8% on the year. Meanwhile, public safety spending was down 8.1% on the month, and 14.1% on th year.  Investors watch this number because it offers insights into the housing market and into homebuilder stocks. It also helps gauge the health of the economy, as companies and the government invest in new infrastructure when they are feeling confident about the economy.
REUTERS/Lee Jae-WonBallmer throws the long ball.The Microsoft-Nokia deal is a smart deal for Nokia, which likely would have gone out of business without it. And, all things considered, it's probably also a smart deal for Microsoft, which is in an increasingly desperate position in mobile. It didn't cost much--$7 billion of offshore cash, which is chump change for Microsoft--and it gives Microsoft another and different (long)shot at trying build a successful mobile business. But just because buying Nokia is a "smart" deal for Microsoft, this doesn't mean it has a good chance of success. It's smart in the same way that throwing a 'Hail Mary' pass is smart: It turns 100% odds of losing into, say, 95%. Consider: Smartphones are the future, and Nokia is basically nowhere in smartphones.†Nokia is still a big player in cheap feature-phone sales, but it's not even a top-5 player in smartphones. So the deal won't vault Microsoft into a leadership position in a business it wants to dominate. If Microsoft wants to continue to throw cash at this problem, it could also buy also-ran BlackBerry. But even then, the combined companies would have less than 10% of the global smartphone business.† Mobile is a platform business, and Microsoft's Windows Phone platform is basically nowhere. According to Comscore, Microsoft had only 3% of the global smartphone market in June. That was even smaller than BlackBerry. It was also up only 0.1% from the prior quarter. The smartphone game is dominated by Android (52%) and Apple (40%). All the advantages in a platform businesses accrue to the market-share leaders. Buying and unifying BlackBerry would help here, too, but, again, the combined companies would have less than 10% share. Nokia's business and culture are entirely different than Microsoft's, and Nokia is massive. Nokia has 35,000 employees, 32,000 of whom are moving to Microsoft. Microsoft has 100,000 employees. †So, "Nokians" will be fully a quarter of the new Microsoft. Hardware manufacturing and distribution, meanwhile, is a completely different business than enterprise and packaged software, and integrating cultures like this is famously difficult. And Nokia is headquartered in Finland. Nokia doesn't (yet) make tablets, which are another big growth area. Microsoft (and Nokia) are already miles behind in the other big mobile business--tablets. They won't help each other here. Nokia and Microsoft are both losing money on their mobile businesses.† Nokia sold about 25 million Windows-based smartphones last year. The company says it needs to sell ~50 million to break even. Android, meanwhile, sold 430 million units (ex China) and Apple sold ~140 million.† Becoming a hardware maker is a major change of strategy for Microsoft, and it will likely kill any remaining hope that Windows can become a ubiquitous smartphone platform like Android. Will other hardware manufactures make Windows phones now that Microsoft is aggressively and directly competing against them? Unlikely. (There aren't many other hardware makers making successful Windows-based phones now, so this isn't a big loss. But it's a nail in the coffin of the traditional Windows strategy.) The "low end of the smartphone market" is already well-served by Android and super-cheap smartphone makers in China and Korea. Nokia is still the second-largest handset maker worldwide because of its production of cheap feature-phones. Microsoft has said that it wants to go after the low end of the smartphone market--feature phone owners who will buy smartphones--and this segment is indeed where Microsoft has the best chance of success. But this market is already very well served. And even Nokia's manufacturing and distribution prowess will not likely be enough to derail the growth of Samsung, LG, Xiaomi, and other cheap smartphone manufacturers, all of which are already building Android phones. Put all that together, and Microsoft-Nokia faces extraordinarily long odds of becoming a major player in the global mobile market. All those who are bashing the deal, however, should remember that Microsoft's current mobile strategy would also have failed. And given that Microsoft seems committed to becoming a "devices and services company," an aggressive move like this makes sense. (It's not necessarily a given that Microsoft should become a "devices" company. In fact, it would probably be better for the company to focus on its historical strengths--software and services. But if you have decided that you are going to become a "devices" company, you might as well jump in with both feet. Time, after all, is a-wasting.) So hats off to Ballmer &amp; Co. for throwing the long ball. The pass will almost certainly fall incomplete. But when you're already losing and time is running out, it's better to throw the ball down field than get sacked in your own end zone.
REUTERS/Tom MihalekHome prices (including distressed sales) climbed 12.4% year-over-year in July, according to CoreLogic's latest home price report. This is the seventeenth straight monthly rise in home prices. Prices were up 1.8% month-over-month. Excluding distressed sales (short sales and REO transactions), home prices were up 11.4% on the year, and 1.7% MoM. We already saw S&amp;P Case-Shiller home prices slow to 12.07% YoY in July. Economists have been calling for a slowdown in the pace of home price growth in the second half of the year. "Looking ahead to the second half of the year, price growth is expected to slow as seasonal demand wanes and higher mortgage rates have a marginal impact on home purchase demand," said Mark Fleming, chief economist at CoreLogic in a press release.

www.flickr.comA 45-year-old senior financial analyst/"sugar daddy" just started writing a dating advice column for Earn The Necklaceó a website for women who date much older men, the New York Post reported. It's unclear who the mystery financial analyst is and where he works. †He writes under the pseudonym "Trent" for Earn the Necklace. † We checked a couple of his columns.† Here what he has to say to a sugar baby who is concerned she's "not enough" for her sugar daddy after finding his secret stash of porn:† "Was your sex life suffering before you found the videos, or now that youíve found them, are you beginning to question things? On one hand, weíre predictable and some old habits never die; even if weíre getting it from you three times a day, weíll still want to pleasure ourselves. Weíre also visual creatures. If heís significantly older, maybe he canít get it up with just his imagination. If it bothers you that much, then talk to him about it. Ask him if heíd rather look at naked pictures or videos of you instead. At the same time, if it makes you feel uncomfortable that heís fantasizing about having sex with porn stars, discuss it. If you feel like youíre being disrespected or not desired enough, you need to address that. No matter how great it is to have a self-induced, toe curling orgasm, it never outweighs making our sugar baby feel bad about herself."† And here's how he thinks a sugar baby can go about introducing role playing in the bedroom: Your sugar daddy isnít into role playing? Interesting. On one hand, if heís not into it, then heís not into it. But on the other hand, most men will come around on some level. If you sense that heís apprehensive, then start slowly and think long-term.† When youíre having dinner, ask him if he has any fantasies, like sleeping with Princess Lea (he probably has; what guy hasnít?) You can try something non-aggressive, like dressing up as the strict librarian. Or, plan a themed date night at home. Dress up anyway you like, and have at†it.† You can read†the columns at Earn The Necklace.†

J.D. Pooley/Getty ImagesHow bad are things in Detroit? In his latest column, the Detroit Free Press' Tom Walsh warns that the city is racing against the end of daylight savings time, Nov. 3, to restore stable service to 40,000 street lights, to prevent students from having to walk home in darkness. Wait, what year is this again? Here's the deal: Tem Gary Brown, named by emergency manager Kevyn Orr to be the city's chief restructuring manager, is trying raise funds to improve basic services and show the state's takeover of city government is producing results. He will first target a set of 5,000 streetlights to get a sense of how best to go about repairing the other 35,000. Brown is also trying to remove abandoned vehicles ‚Äî in case you can't tell, the list of flagging city services that need to be addressed is sort of endless. Walsh writes: Brown also is working in concert with the newly created Public Lighting Authority to start getting about 40,000 non-functioning Detroit streetlights turned on. "By the time Daylight Saving Time ends (Nov. 3), we‚Äôve got to make some serious progress on streetlights, because it will be getting dark earlier as kids are coming home from school,‚Äù he said.&gt; Brown doesn‚Äôt control the timing for kick-starting these initiatives. They all require money, and in the case of the streetlights, completion of a plan by the [newly created Public Lighting Authority] to prioritize which areas of the city ‚Äî hopefully those around schools ‚Äî will get lights fixed first. DTE Energy is working with the PLA now on two demonstration projects, in areas where about 5,000 streetlights need repairs, to diagnose what exactly needs fixing and what the costs will be. Quick action on such basic city services is crucial to building credibility for the argument that Detroit‚Äôs comeback is possible. ‚ÄúBy the middle of October,‚Äù Brown vowed last week, ‚ÄúDetroit residents should see those tow trucks out towing abandoned vehicles. They should see lighting crews out working on the lights, especially around schools where kids are. And hopefully, I can secure funds to get these trees down that are dead and hanging over people‚Äôs houses.‚Äù Let's hope.
This Nokia deal is a dose of reality for any investor that got optimistic when Steve Ballmer announced he was leaving the company.† Instead of creating a simpler company that focuses on the enterprise like everyone wants, Microsoft seems poised to become an even bigger, more complicated company with more money-losing consumer businesses.† Xbox barely makes any money. Windows Phone is a money loser. Bing is a money loser. Consumer PCs are in decline (though they make lots of money). Meanwhile, Office and Servers &amp; Tools are growing, profitable businesses.† The Nokia deal isn't terrible. Microsoft is spending ~$7 billion to acquire its smartphone partner. Odds are that Nokia was going out of business if Microsoft hadn't stepped in. And that $7 billion was just going to be sitting around, since Microsoft wasn't bringing offshore cash back home for tax reasons.† Still, this deal is a reminder that just because Ballmer is leaving, it doesn't mean anything is necessarily going to change at Microsoft.†
The takeover by Microsoft of Nokia's handset division, along with a licence for its patents, leaves behind two divisions that apparently the Redmond-based software company doesn't want: Location &amp; Services (which provides the HERE maps service) and Nokia Siemens Networks (NSN), set up as a joint venture with Sweden's Ericsson but now fully owned by Nokia. It was the takeover of NSN at the end of June which finally cleared the way for the selloff of the handset division, because it meant that the remainder of Nokia would be in charge of its destiny. But what is Microsoft getting - and what is left behind? The Location &amp; Services division, formed from the $8bn acquisition of Navteq in 2007, generates little revenue compared to its NSN sibling. But neither generates much profit: over the past four quarters, they have generated an operating profit of just Ä147m. Over the past two quarters, the Location &amp; Services division has lost far more than the NSN division has generated. Unless the NSN division can start generating more profit, or the Location &amp; Services division has struck a hard bargain with Microsoft over its maps licensing, the company will not be profitable. The Guardian Nokia's handset business, once the top of the heap, has slumped badly in the face of challenges from Samsung and Apple at the top end of the smartphone market, and Chinese "white box" makers at the low end making ultra-cheap smartphones which compete with Nokia's feature phones at the low end. The direction of travel in handset revenue is unmistakable: it is generating less revenue now than at any point since 2002, and since it began selling Windows Phone devices in the fourth quarter of 2011 it hasn't reversed that trend. Microsoft is buying one of the world's smallest smartphone makers. The Guardian The Asha "smart featurephone" sector - which had looked briefly like an interim saviour as feature phones become less important - has also failed to ignite interest. So now Microsoft has a race against time to prevent Android and Apple taking over the world. It won't be easy. This article originally appeared on guardian.co.uk

MicrosoftSatya Nadella, President of Microsoft's Server & Tools unitSEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp has a stable of senior executives who could be contenders to succeed Chief Executive Steve Ballmer, even though outsiders have sparked the most discussion so far. After Ballmer's surprise announcement on Friday that he would retire within a year, the board's lead independent director John Thompson, who heads the search for the new CEO, said the planned transformation of the software giant into a fast-moving 'devices and services' company is still on track. "It does seem like if they are going to continue down the path of this devices and services strategy that they probably get somebody who was part of formulating this strategy or who can stand fully behind it. I don't know if most outside candidates would be willing to do that," said Sid Parakh, an analyst at fund firm McAdams Wright Ragen. He expects Microsoft to favor an internal candidate. But insiders would face skepticism from those who want a clean break from Ballmer's personal legacy, as well as other obstacles. "The issue with internal candidates is that Microsoft has cultivated a holding-company style culture so very few execs are broadly exposed to all areas of the business," said Al Hilwa, an analyst at tech research firm IDC. The following is a list of potential internal candidates, with pros and cons, based on conversations with analysts and insiders. All except Raikes and Thompson are executive vice presidents. Satya Nadella, cloud and enterprise PRO: A 21-year Microsoft veteran, he knows the inner workings of the company, especially the hot areas of servers, data centers and online services. Recently promoted to run the newly created 'cloud and enterprise' unit, he controls the infrastructure behind the 'services' side of Microsoft's new vision. CON: Although he was once a vice president in the Office unit, he might struggle to impose authority over the all-powerful Windows and Office factions, the wellsprings of the company's profits which are famously antagonistic to one another. Tony Bates, corporate strategy PRO: Came to Microsoft two years ago as CEO of the acquired online chat company Skype, which represents the¬†new wave of internet-centric, consumer-focused technology that Microsoft has had difficulty replicating. He so impressed his new boss that Ballmer put him in charge of corporate strategy and relations with developers and PC makers. CON: May not have been at Microsoft long enough to know how to wrench it into a new shape, and his narrow specialty in the telecommunications and router field may not be broad enough to run such a large software-based company. Terry Myerson, operating systems PRO: A young entrepreneur whose web software company was bought by Microsoft in the late 1990s, he might bring a start-up mentality to the top job. Recently selected by Ballmer to run the full range of operating systems - which are still the heart of Microsoft - ranging across Windows PCs, tablets, phones and the Xbox game console. CON: His last assignment was running the Windows Phone unit, which won praise for its clean, stylish software but has not come close to making Microsoft a big player in the smartphone market. Qi Lu, search and Internet PRO: The former Yahoo Inc executive is a heavyweight in the online search and advertising area, with 20 U.S. patents. He now runs the 'applications and services' group, which is in charge of putting Microsoft's established software businesses, like its Office suite, onto the Web. It is a crucial part of Ballmer's reorganization plan. CON: Under his stewardship, the Bing search engine has cost Microsoft billions of dollars without threatening Google Inc's dominance. Julie Larson-Green, Xbox gaming console and Surface tablet PRO: a 20-year veteran of Microsoft and acolyte of recently departed Windows chief Steven Sinofsky, she has intimate knowledge of both the Office and Windows units, having led the redesign of both products. CON: Is now in charge of the 'devices and studios' unit, leading Microsoft's foray into making its own computers and other hardware. The Surface tablet has had poor sales, despite initial enthusiasm. She may be marked down for her close involvement with the tepidly received Windows 8. Eric Rudder, research and technology PRO: A fixture in the background at Microsoft for two decades, this deeply tech-savvy exec now runs Microsoft's long-term research unit and sets overall technical strategy. He is the nearest the company has to a big thinker inthe mold of Bill Gates. CON: Never having been a business unit leader, he may not have the experience to deal with the sharp-elbowed internal politics of Microsoft to survive as CEO. Kevin Turner, COO PRO: Microsoft's Chief Operating Officer for the last eight years, the former Wal-Mart Stores Inc exec is the power behind the company's fearsome sales operation. CON: A professional salesman and motivator, he does not come from an engineering background, which couldbe a liability. Jeff Raikes, philanthropy, ex-Office chief PRO: Bill Gates, who is on the committee to choose the next Microsoft CEO, picked this former leader of the Office unit to be the chief executive of his philanthropic foundation. As Microsoft approaches a critical transition, his long experience, understanding of Gates' thinking and steady hand might be an effective combination. CON: Immersed in the world of philanthropy for the past five years, he may be out of touch with the latest technology trends. The same generation as Ballmer, his appointment might be seen as a continuation of the old guard. John Thompson, search committee leader PRO: It is not beyond the realms of possibility that the man leading the committee to find a new CEO may end up being considered by it. The former IBM executive went on to be CEO of computer security firm Symantec Corp, giving him experience both of a large company reinventing itself and an understanding of the enterprise software market. CON: He only joined Microsoft's board last year and has no direct experience of managing the company. His current day job is CEO of the little-known, privately held cloud-computing firm Virtual Instruments.

A bombshell architecture story is brewing in London's Financial District. A new construction at 20 Fenchurch ó dubbed the Walkie Talkie building, due to its curved shape ó is producing a reflected ray of light so hot it caused a man's Jaguar to partially melt. Here's a photo of the building. You can see how curved it is, and how bright the reflection is.  Jim Waterson at U.K. website City AM has been breaking stories on the building left and right. And he's back today with a report on what may be the most ominous aspect of the whole thing: It's not just one spot on a nearby street that's going to get hot. As the days and seasons change, the hot spot is going to move. So it's not like you can just erect some shade somewhere to solve this issue. Waterson writes: ìIím flabbergasted,î said Dr Philip Oldfield, an expert in tall buildings at the University of Nottinghamís Department of Architecture, who warned other parts of London could be hit by the light beam.† ìAt street level itís unprecedented. The scary thing is that the light wonít always be on that part of the street. The sun angle will change through the next weeks and months ñ and in the winter the localised hotspot will have moved substantially.î City AM's Laura Lean also took this incredible photo of a thermometer in the bright spot hitting 70 celsius which is 158 Fahrenheit!

Meanwhile, Indian stocks are getting shredded again. Bombay's SENSEX index is off about 3.5%. Bloomberg
An incident this morning reveals how jittery the world is, in the midst of escalating geopolitical tensions surrounding Syria. Apparently it was a joint-U.S. Israel test of an "anchor" missile. Around 5 AM, headlines emanating out of Russia said that Russian defense officials had identified the launch of two "objects" fired toward the Easter Mediterranean. However, skepticism that some kind of attack was underway quickly grew, as Israel said its intelligence was aware of no launch, and there were no explosions in Damascus. Eventually more headlines came out of Russia saying that whatever they detected had fallen into the sea. Meanwhile, U.S. officials deny any kind of launch of anything. Here's how things went down... This was an early headline from Reuters... Reuters These additional headlines came out of Russian news agency Interfax.

Columbia University/WikipediaRonald Coase, 1910-2013Ronald Coase was one of those economists whose contributions were so significant and so longstanding that you assumed he had to be dead. But he wasn't, until yesterday, when he died at the age of 102. Coase's most famous contribution is the Coase Theorem, which holds that the problem of externalitiesóthat is, me taking an action that imposes a cost on youócan be fixed without government action so long as property rights are clearly defined and transaction costs are low. My favorite example of the Coase Theorem in action relates to airline seats. A lot of people like to complain about airline passengers who recline, taking away precious knee-room. But Coase would have said there's a simple solution to this problem: pay the person in front of you not to recline. If you value your knee space more than he values the option to lean back, the seat will stay upright where it belongs. There's no need for the government, or the airline, to intervene to protect your knees. One upshot of the Coase Theorem is that it doesn't even matter how the property rights are initially assigned. That is, we currently have a system where you own the right to decide whether to recline your seat; but if reclining were only allowed with the permission of the passenger behind you, you could buy the right to lean back from him. The big question with the Coase Theorem is how often it's true that property rights are clear and transaction costs are low. When I wrote about the airline seat problem two years ago, a lot of people protested to me that costs of this transaction are actually high, because people with normal personalities hate having impromptu negotiations about the price of reclining an airline seat. That's all a lot of whining from people who didn't actually value their knee room enough to pay for it. But in a broader sense, they are right: Often, externalities can't be resolved through the market because the cost of the transactions would be too high. Carbon pollution is a good example. Reclining my airline seat might impose an externality on one person, but carbon emissions cause climate change that impacts billions of people, who cannot practically band together and negotiate a price for the emitters to stop. Government action, such as a tax, is needed to address that externality. The Coase Theorem came out of a 1960 paper called "The Problem of Social Cost." His other really important paper is even older: "The Nature of the Firm," published in 1937, when he was 26 years old. Theoretically, you don't need firms; everyone could be an independent contractor, and you might even conceivably get better market signals that way. In that key paper, Coase tries to answer the question of when and why people form companies, and why they become large or small. Coase argues that the purpose of the firm is to reduce transaction costs: It's easier to put your writers on staff than to negotiate a new freelance price for each individual piece of writing. Or maybe it's not, depending on the nature of the space you're competing in; Coase says firm size, vertical integration and the like will be determined by the relative transaction costs that arise from integrating and not integrating. The ideas in those two papers were the main reasons Coase won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1991, "for his discovery and clarification of the significance of transaction costs and property rights for the institutional structure and functioning of the economy."

Those hoping for the US economy to accelerate in the second half - and many economists made that call early in the year - will be disappointed. While employment metrics seem to show steady improvements, putting the Fed on the "taper path", the economy is facing some increasing headwinds. Here are four indicators signaling a tough road ahead. 1. The rate of improvement in the housing sector is slowing. Weak new home sales number was the first indication that not all is well with US housing (discussed here), but now home price increases (HPI) have leveled off. This trend may actually take MBS off the table for the Fed's taper, leaving the central bank to focus on cutting back only the treasury purchases. SoberLook 2. Personal income growth remains weak. 3. Growth in consumer spending (which represents over 70% of the GDP) has slowed as well. SoberLook 4. As discussed earlier (see post), consumer confidence has peaked in the second quarter and has been declining steadily since. What's particularly troubling is that according to Gallup polling right before this weekend, economic confidence index suddenly dove to the lowest level since the sequester went into effect in March. The uncertainty related to the Syrian crisis and potential US military involvement is one potential explanation.
Flickr/derekskeySeptember is a dangerous month. Five years ago this month, Lehman Brothers went belly-up. Twelve months earlier there was the run on Northern Rock. Black Wednesday in September 1992 saw Britain's departure from the exchange rate mechanism; the pound left the gold standard in September 1931. The signs are that September 2013 will also be an interesting month. That's interesting as in scary. There are five potential flashpoints: Syria, the G20 summit, emerging markets, the Federal Reserve meeting to discuss scaling down the US stimulus, and the German election. Any one of them has the potential to damage the global economy. Let's start with Syria. Military action by the west against the Assad regime could affect growth in two ways: directly, through a higher oil prices and indirectly, by depressing business and consumer confidence. On the face of it, there is no real reason why the air strikes favoured by Barack Obama should have led to the price of crude rocketing. Syria is not an oil producer and there would only be an impact on oil supplies if Iran tried to close the Strait of Hormuz. This seems unlikely. But commodity markets quite often ignore economic fundamentals. There is already a Syria premium built into the price of Brent crude, which was changing hands at just under $120 a barrel in London last week. Any hint of the conflict spreading beyond Syria will see the cost of oil rise further, and while talk of $150 a barrel seems overly pessimistic there have been plenty of examples of rumour, fear and speculation combining to ramp up prices. Capital Economics estimates that $150 crude would knock a percentage point off global growth, turning a lacklustre performance into something close to stagnation. The impact on sentiment is impossible to gauge. There were no long-lasting effects on confidence from the much more extensive military action in Iraq a decade ago, but that was before the Great Recession of the past five years. Businesses looking for a fresh excuse to keep investment plans on hold may find that Syria provides it. That is more likely to be the case if the G20 summit in St Petersburg ends in acrimony. The conclave of developed and developing countries was supposed to usher in a new epoch of more co-operative global governance, and so it did ‚Äì for the first 12 months after the G20's inaugural meeting in Washington in 2008. Since then it has been downhill all the way. G20 countries have failed to agree a joint line on economic stimulus versus austerity, and in the end member countries have simply done their own thing. But this time the summit could get really nasty if Vladimir Putin cuts up rough over US policy towards Syria, and gets backing from China. On past form, the chances of a big diplomatic bust-up are high, in which case expect markets to respond in their time-honoured fashion by seeking out safe havens in gold, the Swiss franc and the US dollar. This would exacerbate the problems of the more vulnerable emerging market economies, which have already seen sharp falls in their currencies against the dollar. India, which saw the rupee sink to a record low last week, and Indonesia, which raised interest rates to defend the rupiah, are the most exposed. Both India and Indonesia have deep-seated structural problems and these have been exposed by the Fed's announcement that it was contemplating scaling back ‚Äì or tapering ‚Äì its asset purchases under the quantitative easing programme. Money has flowed out of emerging markets and back into the US as a result, prompting fears of a rerun of the Asian currency crisis of 1997. These fears are almost certainly overblown. The trouble in the late 1990s was caused by countries with fixed exchange regimes trying to cope with vast hot money flows, which came flooding in and then flooded out again. The worst-affected nations had high levels of foreign currency debt and insufficient reserves with which to fight the speculators. None of that holds true today. There has been no repeat of the big capital flows seen in the 1990s, while floating exchange rate regimes and substantial reserves mean emerging market economies are far better placed to defend themselves. Which is just as well, since collectively the emerging markets are far important to the health of the global economy than they were in 1997. As Nick Parsons of National Australia Bank notes, 30 years ago the advanced world made up 70% of global GDP with emerging markets the other 30%. Today the split is 50-50. As a result, he says, the Fed needs to be careful at its meeting on 18 September. "US policymakers must increasingly be aware of their global responsibilities. The world economy, more than at any point in history, depends crucially on the success of the emerging market bloc and its fast-growing, very populous nations. In 1998 the world economy withstood the Asia crisis. An emerging market crisis now ‚Äì with policy stimulus in the developed world largely exhausted ‚Äì would be a global, not merely a local concern." Of all September's potential pitfalls, policy error by the Fed is the one troubling markets the most. A year ago that would not have been the case, when pundits would have put the German election on 22 September at the top of their list of concerns. That is no longer the case because fears of a breakup of the euro have faded and Europe has emerged from an 18-month double-dip recession. But the eurozone's economic recovery is fragile and the need for a third bailout for Greece shows that the debt crisis is far from over. A tougher approach to debtor countries by the new government in Berlin would not be helpful. Action by the Fed is likely to be modest. The US central bank is not proposing to stop stimulating the economy, merely to scale back the amount of support it provides. The likeliest outcome is that asset purchases will initially be tapered from $85bn a month to $75bn (¬£55bn to ¬£48bn), the equivalent of a doctor slightly reducing the dosage of a powerful drug in the hope that eventually the patient can be taken off medication altogether. Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Fed, has adopted a reassuring bedside manner in his dealings with the stimulus junkies of Wall Street. He has talked through exactly what he plans to do and when he plans to do it. He has made it clear that he doesn't expect markets to stand on their own feet overnight. Even so, there is still no certainty about the way things will pan out. Central banks have been using large doses of experimental drugs, and nobody knows for sure whether there will be dangerous side-effects. In a month's time we should have some sort of inkling of just how powerful those side-effects might prove to be. This article originally appeared on guardian.co.uk

Expect U.S. stocks to pop in the early going.
