AP The House of Representatives is expected to vote late Monday night on a motion to go to conference with the Senate on the government-funding bill, a move that Democrats immediately rejected as a cynical political ploy. Republicans decided not vote on the so-called “clean” CR as demanded by House and Senate Democrats, and the government partially shut down at midnight on Tuesday.  The House Rules Committee met at 10:30 p.m. to decide on a rule that will allow Majority Leader Eric Cantor to request a conference with the Senate. The House later voted to go to conference with the Senate by a 228-199 vote. House Republicans think this move will put pressure on Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Democrats. And it will force them to the negotiating table. “It’s regular order,” a GOP leadership aide told Business Insider to the House's rationale. “It means we’re the reasonable, responsible actors trying to keep the process alive as the clock ticks past midnight, despite Washington Democrats' refusal — thus far — to negotiate.” The aide said that the House GOP will likely not include in the motion a stopgap bill to fund the government for a short, one- or two-week period. Instead, they will again look to pass their latest offer — one that has in it two amendments that chip away at Obamacare, and that the Senate rejected Monday evening. The House's final pre-shutdown move came after Republicans have rejected the idea of going to conference on the budget for months. Citing that fact — Republicans have opposed 18 opportunities to go to conference on the federal budget — Reid slammed House Republicans' latest “gambit” on the Senate floor.  He called on the House to pass a clean, six-week CR before the two chambers go to conference. “We will not go to conference with a gun to our head,” Reid said. “... I want everyone to hear what I just said. We will not go to conference without a clean CR.” The Senate will reconvene at 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday, when it will move to table the House GOP's latest plan. "And," a Senate Democratic aide said, "we will be back at square one." In case you're keeping score, here's the ping-pong that the Senate and House have played since Friday:
In a regulatory filing, hedge fund Perry Capital, once the third largest holder of J.C. Penney stock, revealed that it dumped about half its stake in the company. The fund, with about $4.8 billion in assets under management, cut its stake from 8.62% of the company down to 3.28%, according to the filing. Perry had been one of the top three hedge fund holders of J.C. Penney stock along with Soros Management and Glevniew Capital. This is bad news for J.C. Penney, which has seen its stock drop almost 30% in the last week. The first wave of heavy selling was sparked last weekÂ  on Wednesday the 25th after Goldman Sachs released a report rating the stock an "underperform," reasoningÂ that the company will need to take on more debt to keep cash flowing. The following Friday the company announced that it would issue almost $1 billion worth of new shares at an offering price of $9.65. At the end of the trading day Monday, the stock topped out at $8.81.
APIn less than an hour, a bill to avert a government shutdown has gone from the House to the Senate and, finally, back to the House. Shortly after 9:25 p.m. ET, the Senate voted to kill two House-passed amendments that chip away at Obamacare, which the House had passed less than an hour before. That puts the Senate's co-called "clean" CR back in the House less than three hours before a midnight shutdown deadline. Senate Democrats' rejection of the House bills had been forecast before the House even voted on them.  "We will be right back at square one yet again. House Republicans simply have to choose whether to put the Senate’s clean CR on the floor and let it pass with Democratic and Republican votes, or force a Republican government shutdown," a senior Senate Democratic aide said. The House passed two changes to Obamacare in its continuing resolution by a 228-201 vote. It delays by one year the implementation of the individual mandate, and it includes language that would bar lawmakers, Congressional staffers, and administration staffers from receiving federal subsidies for health insurance under Obamacare.  Earlier on Monday, the Senate made the same move, killing two GOP amendments that the House passed Saturday night. After the House vote, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid quoted Albert Einstein's definition of insanity and said, "Republicans have lost their minds." The Senate then voted, 54-46, to table the amendments.
REUTERSChina's National Bureau of Statistics just released the country's official manufacturing PMI report. The headline number climbed to just 51.1 in September from 51.0 in August. Economists were expecting a reading of 51.6. Any number above 50 signals growth. "[I]ndustrial production grew surprisingly strongly above trend both in July and August while manufacturing fixed asset investments improved as well," noted Societe Generale's Wei Yao ahead of the report. "These positive signs in the manufacturing sector are likely to persist in September, and would be reflected in the PMI survey." Here's a breakdown of the report On Sunday, we learned that HSBC's unofficial PMI climbed to just 50.2 in September from 50.1 in August. This was a bit lighter than the 51.2 expected. "The September HSBC China Manufacturing PMI edged up slightly from August," said HSBC's Hongbin Qu. "New orders remained flat from the previous month, while external demand improved. Manufacturers restocking process continued but remained relatively slow. Growth is bottoming out on Beijing’s mini-stimulus. We expect continuous policy efforts to sustain the recovery."   Click Here For Live Updates »
Societe GeneraleSouth Korea Foreign TradeKorean exports unexpectedly fell by 1.5% year-over-year in September. Economists were looking for 2.5% growth. Economists across Wall Street dub South Korean exports as the global economic canary in the coal mine. Korean trade data is extremely sensitive to the economic activity in developed and emerging Asia. It usually comes before the first trading session of the month in Asia, which makes it the first of the world's major economic indicators to be released. In recent months, however, Korean trade data have been impacted significantly by the volatile yen, which has made Japanese goods more competitive than Korean goods in the international marketplace. "Exports should continue their recent strength while imports should remain stable in September despite the impact of the Chuseok holidays," said Societe Generale's Suktae Oh ahead of the release.  "We expect the September trade data to show strong exports driven by the strength of the US and Chinese economies, supporting both GDP growth and the Korean won."

APPresident Barack Obama placed phone calls to all four Congressional leaders Monday night, but there appears to be no resolution in sight to a looming government shutdown.  The White House said that Obama called House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (R-Nev.), and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.  Here is the key part of the White House's readout, and one that suggests there's still a wide gulf between the two parties: The President made clear to the Republican Leadership that they must act, as the Senate has, to pass the bill that funds the government for six weeks that doesn’t include any extraneous ideological riders.  The President urged the House to bring up this clean Continuing Resolution for a vote tonight to keep the government open and avoid a shutdown.  The President reinforced with the Republican Leaders that he will continue to oppose any politically-motivated attempts to defund or delay the Affordable Care Act, attempts which would never pass the Senate or become law.  And he reiterated that he will not negotiate on the debt limit: Congress must pay the bills it has already incurred and avoid a devastating blow to our economy. And here's the readout from Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck: "The president called the speaker this evening to discuss funding for the government and Obamacare. The speaker told the president that Obamacare is costing jobs and that American families are being denied basic fairness when big businesses are getting exemptions that they are not. The call lasted nearly ten minutes.” The House is in the process of moving forward a continuing resolution to avert a government shutdown that makes key alterations to Obamacare. It delays by one year the implementation of the individual mandate, and it includes language that would bar lawmakers, Congressional staffers, and administration staffers from receiving federal subsidies for health insurance under Obamacare.If it passes through the House, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has said that the Senate will immediately reject the amendments.  The government will shut down on Tuesday if no agreement is reached.
AiGAustralia's latest manufacturing PMI report is out, and the numbers are encouraging. The headline PMI number surged to 51.7 in September from 46.4 in August. Any number above 50 signals expansion. The last time Australia's PMI was above 50 was in June 2011. The new orders sub-index jumped to 53.6 from 44.2 a month ago. The exports sub-index came in at an ugly 31.4. However, it's an improvement from the 28.3 read a month ago. From the report: Australia's export-driven, mining economy has struggled with the slowdown in the emerging markets. "Make no mistake - the Australian tide is going to be heading way out as China is about to have what our economist Wei Yao described as its' Minsky moment', or in layman's terms, its day of reckoning!" warned Societe Generale strategist Albert Edwards. "But even before China suffers this 'moment', final demand in the commodity dependent Western Australia (WA) has fallen into recession.
APRep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) Update: Or maybe not. On Monday evening, the House adopted a rule for consideration of tonight's continuing resolution with only six Republican "no" votes, of which only two came from moderates: Reps. Peter King (R-N.Y.) and Charlie Dent (R-Pa.) Business Insider asked Kevin Fogarty, spokesman for Rep. King, what happened to the moderate revolt that King was trumpeting. Fogarty replied: "You would have to ask the moderate offices that." Earlier: This evening, House Speaker John Boehner (R) and Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R) are making their third attempt to get Obamacare changes in exchange for passing a continuing resolution to keep the government open. They're getting some opposition from the right, including the Senate Conservatives Fund and Heritage Action, which don't like the fact that the new plan wouldn't defund Obamacare entirely. But what's new is that Republican moderates are threatening to vote against leadership's plan because they do not want to have this fight over Obamacare. And those moderates may have enough votes to block the plan from passing. Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) has declared his intention to vote against the rule bringing tonight's amendments to the floor. King spokesman Kevin Fogarty told Business InsiderÂ he has 25 other moderate Republicans with him against any further defund-Obamacare push on this continuing resolution. Especially since some conservative members are likely to vote against the CR from the right, that spells big trouble for Boehner's plan. Fogarty told Business Insider that Reps. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) and Louie Gohmert (R-Texas), two of the House's most hardline conservatives, were not among the count of 20-25 moderates. Both plan to vote "no" on the amendment. Boehner can probably only afford 17 total Republican "no" votes, since only two Democrats are likely to vote with Republican leadership. We've started to see rumblings of moderate Republican revolt this month. When the House passed a bill cutting the food stamp program by $40 billion, 15 moderate Republicans balked on the grounds that the cuts were too big. On Saturday, two moderate Republicans voted against amending the continuing resolution to delay Obamacare for a year, including its mandate that employer-provided health plans cover contraception. One of those representatives, Rep. Richard Hanna (R-N.Y.), told Business Insider in an email, "as a lifelong and consistent supporter of women's rights and health care, I do not support addressing divisive social issues such as access to birth control on a last-minute continuing resolution." On both food stamps and Saturday's CR vote, moderates didn't have enough votes to stop the House from pursuing an agenda driven by pressure from outside conservative groups. If King gets his way tonight, we'll have found the force that can stop the Jim DeMint takeover of the House GOP. But perhaps the really radical thing is not what King plans to do but how he's talking about it. He told National Review: "If Obamacare is as bad as we say itâ€™s going to be, then we should pick up a lot of seats in the next election and we should win the presidency in 2016." If Obamacare is as bad as we say it's going to be? That's the kind of talk that makes Rush Limbaugh's head explode.
Thomson Reuters, Factset, Morgan Stanley ResearchIt's the last day of September, which means Q3 is wrapping up and earnings season will heat up in just a few weeks. Analysts expect S&amp;P 500 companies to report 5% year-over-year earnings growth. Morgan Stanley's Adam Parker expects companies to report estimate-beating revenues, but earnings that fall short of expectations.Â  The ratio of negative to positive guidance versus consensus estimates is high at 3.29 for Q3, as companies continue to lower analyst expectations. Parker believes companies are attempting to manage expectations because investors have punished the stocks of those that have issuedÂ guidance below consensus expectations and rewarded thoseÂ who exceeded analyst estimates. However, he also believes that estimates have "further to fall." "We continueÂ to believe estimates are too high as analysts areÂ embedding 7% earnings growth in 2013 to $110 per share,Â followed by 11% growth in 2014 to $122 per share," wrote Parker. "Our top-down estimates remain below consensus-Â $106 and $112 of earnings per share in 2013 and 2014,Â respectively." Here's more of what Parker will be looking for this season: ... Capital Spending remains a hot topic, and we are looking for signs the companies in technology, industrials, and consumer feel the need to add capacity. We are not expecting big currency / commodity impacts during the quarter. Financials had a strong Q2, and volatility in interest rates will be a key variable during Q3 earnings and guidance. Lastly, we are curious about any commentary from companies with concentrated emerging markets exposure. For his clients looking for an investing strategy, Parker recommendsÂ underweights in consumerÂ discretionary and consumer staples, and overweights inÂ health care, technology, andÂ industrials. 
www.linkedin.comNancy Anderson, CFP.If you ask most people, they'll probably say that budgeting isn't terribly titillating ... unless, of course, we're talking about someone else'sÂ finances. Let's be honest: Although you may not want to fess up to just how much of your monthly budget you blow on eating out each month, it's easy to judge the bad spending habits of othersâ€”like the next-door neighbor who just bought a second set of pricey wheels. Yes, there's nothing like financial voyeurism, which is why we convinced three brave people, whose annual household incomes come in at around $70,000, to share the details of their monthly spendingâ€”and savingâ€”habits. And we do mean every detail: Each intrepid participant divided his or her budget into percentages, which were then color-coded in line with the 50/20/30 rule. The rule recommends that you allocate 50% of your budget for essentials (housing, transportation, utilities and groceries), 20% toward financial priorities (retirement contributions, savings, and debt payments), and the remaining 30% for bonus (read: fun) lifestyle expenses. We then asked Nancy Anderson, a CFPÂ® with LearnVest Planning Services, to review each budget to see how they are mastering their moneyâ€”and where there's room for a little financial improvement. I recently got a new job after being laid off earlier this year, and while Iâ€™m happy to be back at work, I had to take a pay cut in the process. My wife and I have two kids under the age of 12, so she works part-time as a teacherâ€™s aide here in Utah. To keep our costs in check, sheâ€™s been great at reexamining our budget recently, and weâ€™ve made cuts where we can. For example, she stopped going to Pilates, and I canceled my cable TV subscription to NFL RedZoneâ€”as much as it breaks my heart! RELATED: 10 Real People Share Their Workout Costs Iâ€™m also tempted to remortgage our home, but weâ€™re on track to pay it off right before my daughter goes to collegeâ€”and I know that Iâ€™ll need the extra money more then than I do now. But I do worry about costs as my kids get older: Between my 12-year-old wanting to do nothing but shop, and my 8-year-old boy going through a growth spurt like every other week, it seems like we spend all of our money on clothing. Luckily, I was able to contribute close to 50% of my paycheck to my 401(k) before we had kids, so even though I know itâ€™s not the smartest move, Iâ€™ve scaled back on my current contributions. Maybe as the kids get older, my wife can start working more, but for now, weâ€™re making it work.LearnVest What Nancy Says:Congratulations to Dave for finding a new position in a tight job market! And they're doing a good job of still saving almost 10% of their incomeâ€”even with a pay cut. But instead of refinancing or cutting too far back on his retirement contributions, Dave should consider reducing even more of his familyâ€™s regular recurring expenses, like he did with the NFL channel. Do an energy audit. Set up a clothing swap with friends who have kids around the same age. Consider a ride share to reduce overhead. Dave has a great start for retirement, but he should be careful not to borrow from tomorrow for today. He can start by bumping his contributions to his 401(k) at least up to the match, and then increase it incrementally from there. RELATED: Top Retirement Mistakes to Avoid I'm divorced, with no kids. And I live in a two-bedroom townhouse just outside Atlanta that's on a lease-purchase plan, with a roommate who also contributes about 35% toward groceries and utilities. I work from home, which impacts my budget in a couple of ways: I have to pay for faster Internet, and my utilities are higher because I'm around all of the time. On the other hand, my car doesn't get as much wear and tear, and I don't have high fuel costsâ€”I fill it up maybe two times a month! I'm currently paying off back taxes from a previous business venture, and I took out a $13,500 loan through my credit union to cover them. About 20% of my net income goes toward the principal on that loan each month. It's a five-year loan, butÂ since the interest rate is high at 14.95%,Â I plan to pay it off in the next 18 months. RELATED:Â I Paid Off $90,000 of Debt in Just Three Years Once the loan is paid down, I'll be able to allocate close to 50% of my income toward savings by maxing out my IRA contributions each year. Currently, Iâ€™m only contributing 5% to my 401(k) because that's the amount that my employer will match, and I don't see any sense in contributing more right now. LearnVest What Nancy Says: Kudos to Kara for such a high savings rateâ€”21%â€”while still taking a big chunk out of her monthly budget to pay down high-interest loans. She has done a good job of keeping her expenses low in order to help her save. To save even more, I'd encourage her to keep track of any home office expenses that may be tax deductible--even a small tax refund could have a big impact. That said, I'm definitely in favor of increasing her retirement allocation because the 5% total contribution rate may not be enough to fund her retirement. I'd recommend running aÂ retirement calculation to motivate her to do more now. Once the loan is paid off, I would also have Kara designate a small amount of money for a â€œfun account,â€ so she can enjoy life while still saving and investing for the future.RELATED:Â How Much Money Do You Really Need for Retirement? My husband and I have had some big changes recently, so weâ€™re still adjusting to our new financial situation. In January, my husband left active duty in the Air Guard to go back to school for his bachelor's degree before returning to the Guard full-time in June. Iâ€™m in the Guard too, and I was also in school full-time and working part time, before I started my full-time job in Washington state earlier this year. Luckily, thanks to the GI Bill, most of our schooling this year was covered. We also moved this year, and we are now carrying two mortgages. But, by renting out our old house, weâ€™re making enough money to cover the monthly mortgage payments on that home, as well as put an additional $150 toward the principal each month. And, luckily, we donâ€™t have any other debt. RELATED: Buying a House: How Much Can You Afford? In a month, Iâ€™ll be eligible to start contributing to my 401(k). My company matches 50%, so my goal is to contribute the maxâ€”75% of my paycheckâ€”through the end of the year to contribute as much as possible. Since I started working full-time, Iâ€™ve noticed that our eating-out expenses have shot up. Our grocery bill is also a bit higher, since we recently decided to start eating better, trading mac and cheese for chicken and vegetables. Itâ€™s obviously more expensive and more work, but it will be worth it for our health in the long run.LearnVest What Nancy Says: For someone who's just starting out in her career, Karrie really has a handle on a long-term point of view when it comes to her finances. And itâ€™s great that she and her husband are taking advantage of a well-deserved benefit for their education: the GI Bill. As rental property owners, rather than put the extra income toward their principal,Â I would recommendÂ setting up a rental property savings account first that would cover services, repairs and other unforeseen expensesâ€”including the mortgage itselfâ€”if the home is ever unoccupied. And since time is on her side for retirement, Karrie should start her contributions at the company matching percentage, as she suggests, and then gradually increase her contributions by 1% every six months. That way, sheâ€™ll hardly feel it!

"Curiously enough a difference of opinion on the first shutdown was tied to issues that included Medicare premiums.

DonkeyHotey/FlickrThis afternoon, disquiet washed over the Business Insider newsroom as we considered a scenario. What if the government shuts down tomorrow and stays shut down all the way through Oct. 17, when the federal government hits its debt limit? Will it still be possible to mint the trillion-dollar coin, or will U.S. Mint staff have been deemed "non-essential" and sent home? You can breathe easy. Even during a government shutdown, minting the coin is possible. A government shutdown only affects government agencies that are funded through annual congressional appropriations. The U.S. Mint isn't one of them â€” it's funded through the sale of the coins it produces. As such, the Treasury Department's shutdown plan indicates the mint will stay open. For the platinum coin strategy to work, the coin would then have to be deposited with the Federal Reserve. Since the Fed is funded from its own activities, it would stay open too. At a time when Washington is topsy-turvy, it's good to know that at least one thing can still work like it's supposed to: The use of large-denomination platinum coins to circumvent the debt limit.
Unless Congress can miraculously agree on a budget between now and midnight, we'll see the U.S. government shut down starting tomorrow. However, this is no reason to dump all of your stocks.

AP President Barack Obama scolded Congressional Republicans in a terse speech from the White House briefing room, just seven hours before the federal government was set to shut down for the first time in 17 years. "You don't get to extract a ransom for doing your job," Obama said, calling out a Tea Party faction in the House of Representatives that has insisted on using the government-funding debate to make changes to the Affordable Care Act. "One faction of one party in one house of Congress in one branch of government doesn't get to shut down the entire government just to re-fight the results of the election," he said. Obama's statement came right before he was scheduled to hold a Cabinet meeting, which will likely focus on preparations for a government shutdown.  The government is likely to hit the deadline at midnight, as Congress has moved no closer to an agreement Monday that will keep the government funded.  The Democratic-controlled Senate tabled two amendments in the House of Representatives' version of the continuing resolution that made changes to the Affordable Care Act. The House has responded by offering a plan to pass two new amendments that chip away at Obamacare. Obama pointed out that the Affordable Care Act will continue to be implemented "no matter what Congress decides to do today." Insurance exchanges, he said, are open on Tuesday.  "You can't shut it down," he said. He took no questions from reporters. Obama also noted some of the more practical effects of the shutdown, which he said would have a "very real economic impact on real people, right away":
APThis official White House photo was taken on November 17, 1995, two days after the day when Monica Lewinsky said her sexual relationship with President Bill Clinton began. A government shutdown that sent non-essential White House staff home allowed unpaid interns like Lewinsky an unusual level of access to the president.Government shutdowns cause a wide variety of problems. National parks close, people can't file applications for disability benefits, about 800,000 federal employees are put on leave without pay. In 1995, there was one more problem: With non-essential White House staff having been sent home, unpaid interns took on extra responsibility, which allowed Monica Lewinsky to spend some quality time with then-President Bill Clinton. Here's how the Starr Report describes the events of November 15, 1995: During the shutdown, Ms. Lewinsky worked in Chief of Staff Panetta's West Wing office, where she answered phones and ran errands.Â The President came to Mr. Panetta's office frequently because of the shutdown, and he sometimes talked with Ms. Lewinsky.Â She characterized these encounters as "continued flirtation."Â According to Ms. Lewinsky, a Senior Adviser to the Chief of Staff, Barry Toiv, remarked to her that she was getting a great deal of "face time" with the President. Ms. Lewinsky testified that Wednesday, November 15, 1995â€”the second day of the government shutdownâ€”marked the beginning of her sexual relationship with the President... According to Ms. Lewinsky, she and the President made eye contact when he came to the West Wing to see Mr. Panetta and Deputy Chief of Staff Harold Ickes, then again later at an informal birthday party for Jennifer Palmieri, Special Assistant to the Chief of Staff.Â At one point, Ms. Lewinsky and the President talked alone in the Chief of Staff's office. In the course of flirting with him, she raised her jacket in the back and showed him the straps of her thong underwear, which extended above her pants. En route to the restroom at about 8 p.m., she passed George Stephanopoulos's office. The President was inside alone, and he beckoned her to enter.Â She told him that she had a crush on him. He laughed, then asked if she would like to see his private office. Through a connecting door in Mr. Stephanopoulos's office, they went through the President's private dining room toward the study off the Oval Office. Ms. Lewinsky testified: "We talked briefly and sort of acknowledged that there had been a chemistry that was there before and that we were both attracted to each other and then he asked me if he could kiss me." Ms. Lewinsky said yes. In the windowless hallway adjacent to the study, they kissed.Â Before returning to her desk, Ms. Lewinsky wrote down her name and telephone number for the President. At about 10 p.m., in Ms. Lewinsky's recollection, she was alone in the Chief of Staff's office and the President approached.Â He invited her to rendezvous again in Mr. Stephanopoulos's office in a few minutes, and she agreed.Â (Asked if she knew why the President wanted to meet with her, Ms. Lewinsky testified: "I had an idea.") They met in Mr. Stephanopoulos's office and went again to the area of the private study.Â This time the lights in the study were off. According to Ms. Lewinsky, she and the President kissed. She unbuttoned her jacket; either she unhooked her bra or he lifted her bra up; and he touched her breasts with his hands and mouth.Â Ms. Lewinsky testified: "I believe he took a phone call . . . and so we moved from the hallway into the back office . . . . [H]e put his hand down my pants and stimulated me manually in the genital area."Â While the President continued talking on the phone (Ms. Lewinsky understood that the caller was a Member of Congress or a Senator), she performed oral sex on him.Â He finished his call, and, a moment later, told Ms. Lewinsky to stop. In her recollection: "I told him that I wanted . . . to complete that. And he said . . . that he needed to wait until he trusted me more. And then I think he made a joke . . . that he hadn't had that in a long time." Even if the government shuts down tomorrow, this won't happen again, and not just because Barack Obama has better impulse control than Bill Clinton. According to The Hill, White House interns will no longer be allowed to work during government shutdowns.

Special needs schools and daytime-only schools were not taken into consideration for this list. Every school on this list charges more than $50,000 a year to attendâ€”money that goes towards living facilities, dining halls, and some fairly unbelievable perks. The majority of these are located in the northeast, with many in Massachusetts. California also makes the list several times with a handful of expensive progressive academies.

REUTERS/Jonanthan ErnstLate-afternoon visitors climb a stairway outside the U.S. Capitol in Washington, September 28, 2013.Stocks are now down in seven of the last eight trading sessions. First, the scoreboard: And now the top stories:
APCould this be the part in the familiar script in which the plan blows up in John Boehner's face? A GOP leadership aide confirmed that the House of Representatives is planning to move new amendments to keep the government funded later Monday, just hours before the government is set to shut down. The amendments include a one-year delay of the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate, along with language that would bar lawmakers, Congressional staffers, and administration staffers from receiving federal subsidies for health insurance under Obamacare. That amendment has been offered in the Senate by Sen. David Vitter (R-La.). The new plan is likely to cause the government to shut down, as the Democratic-controlled Senate will reject them. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid says he will not pass a continuing resolution that contains any changes to Obamacare. The Senate made good on that promise earlier Monday, rejecting two amendments that the House had passed on Saturday. But there are already signs that the latest GOP plan to avert a shutdown may have trouble passing through the Republican-controlled House. And the reactions coming out of the House Republican caucus suggest that this could be another blow-up in Boehner's face — a la his "Plan B" that failed ahead of the debate over the "fiscal cliff." One House member told National Review's Robert Costa that it "sux": Member txts from inside mtg: "this sux" I respond: "why?" Member doesn't respond Leaving mtg, in same elevator as Sanford, Steve King is vague when pressed on whether Boehner even has votes for new CR plan. Shrugs. Rep Don Young: "right now they don't have the votes to do anything" Rep. Michele Bachmann won't vote for new House plan, says it "doesn't go far enough." Opposition comes from some members opposed to cutting health plans of staffers. Remember, three weeks ago, Boehner and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor offered members a plan that would served as a ploy to make the Senate vote on Obamacare defunding — but would have kept the government funded if the Senate didn't pass Obamacare defunding. Conservatives called this out as a gimmick that wouldn't defund Obamacare. Second, the Vitter amendment might not get support because it would directly hit the pockets of Congressional staffers. When Vitter tried to bring up his amendment during debate over an unrelated energy-efficiency bill, Politico's Ginger Gibson reported that staffers from Republican offices were reaching out to their Democratic counterparts to get assurance that the amendment would not pass. With 232 Republicans in the House, Boehner can only afford 15 defections from his caucus to pass a bill.
On Wall Street, an IPO is a joyous, splendid occasion much like the birth of a child. Unfortunately, because of the possibility of a government shut down, we may see a delay in the number of bouncing baby public companies that come into the world over the coming weeks. According to the SEC's government shut down contingency plan, IPOs — like the one Twitter is currently planning —  do not make it onto the 'absolutely must-do' list. This is in part because, during a government shut down, the SEC will only have about 6.1% of its employees working on staff — those employees will be designated and informed of their position by a Contingency Planning Committee and the Office of General Counsel. It should also be pointed out that, according to the WSJ the SEC will remain fully open on Tuesday thanks to some extra cash they have on hand from last year. SEC spokesman John Nester wouldn't say how much cash the agency has but also said it could potentially keep the lights on for about about a week.  Regardless, here's what that 6.1% will be doing if/when everything does go down: Included on this list of activities that won't carry on at the SEC are non-emergency litigation or FOIA requests, rule making, and international matters will all be discontinued. So will all oversight of self-regulatory organizations and Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. What's really bad for the Twitter (or any) IPO, though, is that the functions listed below will be completely frozen: Review and approval of applications for registration by entities (e.g., investment advisers, broker-dealers, transfer agents, nationally recognized statistical rating organizations, investment companies,and municipal advisors)and with respect to new financial products; review and approval of self-regulatory organization rule changes; review and acceleration of effectiveness of registration statements by issuers for securities offerings; review of periodic reports and other filings; and non-emergency support to registrants. So there will be no one in Washington to dot an i and cross a t on Twitter's IPO documents. Bummer.
">Daniel Goodman / Business InsiderCredit ratings agency S&amp;P is out with a Q&amp;A about the ongoing budget showdown in Washington. Titled "The Debt Ceiling Debate Is Unlikely To Change The 'AA+' U.S. Sovereign Rating," the report argues just that. "In our opinion, the current impasse over the continuing resolution and the debt ceiling creates an atmosphere of uncertainty that could affect confidence, investment, and hiring in the U.S." wrote S&amp;P according to CNBC. "However, as long as it is short-lived, we do not anticipate the impasse to lead to a change in the sovereign rating," Obviously, should this madness drag on and the U.S. miss a payment, S&amp;P could put the country into "selective default." S&amp;P added that selective defaults lead to even lower credit ratings between CCC+ and B. "This sort of political brinkmanship is the dominant reason the [U.S.] rating is no longer 'AAA'," they added. S&amp;P downgraded the U.S. from AAA to AA+ on August 5, 2011.
The oldest, most heated rivalry in the enterprise tech world has just flared up again. SAP's billionaire cofounder, Hasso Plattner, is now throwing punches at Oracle president Mark Hurd. Plattner wrote in a blog post on Monday, "When it comes to competition you should either know exactly what your are talking about, or keep your mouth shut." He was responding to things Hurd said about the SAP HANA database at a press conference last week. Hurd spoke to reporters shortly after Oracle introduced a new in-memory database that competes with SAP's in-memory database, called HANA. Oracle also introduced a new "Exadata" hardware product that runs its new in-memory database. In-memory databases are where an entire database, even an enormous one, is stored in a server's memory, not on a hard disk. That means it can crunch through vast amounts of data  instantly and isn't slowed down by grabbing data from the disk. With these new products, Oracle is trying to keep SAP's customers from yanking out their Oracle database and replacing it with SAP's database. Here's what Hurd said at the conference, reported by Chris Kanaracus from IDG News Service: "I don't like it when [Oracle's] Exadata or the in-memory options get compared with SAP HANA ...I don't think it's even comparable. HANA has to be programmed. What we told you about [with the new 12c database] has nothing to do with that. You're not rewriting anything." Putting it more bluntly, Hurd said about SAP, "Forget them." To which Plattner responded: "Fact is: nobody likes to be replaced by a competitor's solution. A good defense is to build a better product, not to bad mouth the competition with straight lies." Plattner then went into a technical deep dive about how databases work, refuting that Oracle apps need "reprogramming" when used with SAP's HANA. WikipediaHasso PlattnerThe fighting words are entertaining, but this is serious business. By some accounts there are at least 60,000 enterprises out there using SAP's apps with the Oracle database. In two years since HANA launched, SAP has snagged some 2,000 customers for it, it says. SAP hinted that about 300 HANA customers are using it with SAP's financial apps, although it won't say how many switched from Oracle to HANA.  But clearly, there's a lot at stake and executives at both companies are ready to fight. We reached out to Oracle for comment.
IN THE early 1980s the distressing persistence of high unemployment in Europe was labelled "Eurosclerosis". Some now wonder whether "Amerisclerosis" is the right word to describe Americaâ€™s labour market. It is true that unemployment has slowly dropped from a peak of 10% in late 2009, to 7.3% at present. But this decline overstates the health of the jobs market. The labour-force participation rate, the share of the working-age population either working or looking for work, has plunged from 66% in 2007 to 63.2% in August, a 35-year low. If those people who have simply dropped out of the labour force were classified as unemployed, the headline jobless rate would be much higher. This drop in the participation rate is striking by international standards, too. Among 34 (mainly rich-country) OECD countries, only in Ireland and Iceland did participation rates fall farther between 2007 and 2012. In Italy and Britain, where unemployment rates have risen by a roughly similar amount as in America, labour-force participation rose (see left-hand chart). Many economists believe much of this decline in participation is structural. They argue it reflects increased college enrolment by the young, the approach of retirement for the baby-boomers and a levelling-off in womenâ€™s participation after rapid post-war increases. That is doubtless part of the story, but it does not explain everything. Participation rates have declined sharply for "prime-age" men and women between 25 and 54, and risen slightly for those aged 55 and over. By contrast, participation has generally risen for prime-age women in other OECD countries, and risen or fallen only slightly for men. Cyclical factors are also at work. The unemployed may give up looking for work after long spells of unemployment. Bart Hobijn of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco says that in much of Europe, jobless benefits, which generally require recipients to keep looking for work, are more generous and last longer than in America. That may explain why participation rates there have not fallen. In America, he says, workers are more likely to go back to study or stay at home. The so-called U-6 unemployment rate, which includes those who want jobs but havenâ€™t looked lately or have given up, and those who work part-time because they cannot find full-time work, rose more in the past five years than the official unemployment rate. In a 2011 paper* Mr Hobijn and three co-authors noted that many of those reported as newly unemployed have in fact been out of work for months but have not previously been recorded as unemployed, probably because they have taken a break from the job search. The authors reckon that these "fringe" workers are much more prevalent than in previous cycles. The big question is whether such workers will start looking for work again in time. The signs are worrying. If you look at U-6 unemployment over just the past two years, rather than the past five, it has fallen faster than official unemployment. That suggests many of the people on the periphery of the labour force have now left it entirely. One explanation for that may be government benefits that affect incentives to look for work. More generous unemployment benefits tend to elevate participation rates since workers must be looking for work to qualify. With disability insurance (DI), however, the opposite applies: to qualify applicants must generally demonstrate that they cannot work. In theory, disability and unemployment should not be correlated--and from 1966 to 1985 they were not, according to a new study prepared for the Brookings Papers on Economic Activity by Olivier Coibion and two others. But in 1984 DI eligibility criteria were eased so that applicants could qualify based on a combination of conditions rather than just one. Since then, highly subjective conditions such as back pain and mental illnesses have grown to account for most DI beneficiaries, and claims have become more correlated with unemployment (see right-hand chart). That strongly suggests that many workers find a way to qualify for DI when other benefits have been exhausted. Between 2007 and 2012 the number of applicants for DI shot up from 11.2 per 1,000 working-age people to 14. Unpublished research by Mary Daly of the San Francisco Fed, Richard Burkhauser of Cornell University and Brian Lucking, a graduate student, estimates that this rise in applications equates to 2.6m people. Depending on how many of those applicants are eventually awarded benefits, this could explain between 31% and 59% of the decline in participation among 16-to-64-year-olds. These results suggest that if it were not for people receiving disability insurance, reported unemployment would be far higher. Although DI recipients may initially have climbed because the economy was weak, their numbers will almost certainly not decline when it strengthens again; only 4% of beneficiaries return to work within ten years. The proportion of working-age adults on DI has risen from 1.3% in 1970 to 4.6% in 2013. The impact on participation rates may be cyclical at first and then become structural. Europe may have useful lessons here. In the 1970s DI became more generous in the Netherlands, and case loads exploded. Had the increase in disability numbers shown up in unemployment instead, the Dutch unemployment rate, which was 6% in 1980, would have been 13.4%, according to a 1992 report by Mr Burkhauser and two co-authors. The crushing expense of DI eventually forced the Dutch government to make reforms about a decade ago, primarily by making employers bear more of the expense of employees who end up on the system. Since then, case loads have dropped. America, whose DI trust fund is expected to run dry in 2016 on current trends, should show similar resolve. Click here to subscribe to The Economist 
en.wikipedia.org Renowned for its vast oil reserves, Daqing, a city in the far northern province of Heilongjiang, is one of the richest cities in China. However, declining reserves and China's broader shift towards cleaner energy sources have fostered doubts over whether the city's past glory can be sustained for much longer. A recent trip to the city by The Economist Intelligence Unit confirms that in the near term, the outlook for Daqing remains positive: oil demand in the country remains huge, and domestic oil production is still a national strategic priority. Over the long run, however, Daqing's efforts to diversify would do well to play better on the city's strengths if they are to succeed. The past three decades of strong economic growth have been accompanied by a sharp increase in energy consumption. In turn, cities blessed with energy resources, such as Daqing, have boomed. China's most productive oilfield is in Daqing, and the city gained national prominence in the 1960s when Mao launched a social movement lauding the hard-working spirit of local oil workers, entitled "Learning from the Daqing Spirit". The city is now one of China's richest cities, with GDP per head of Rmb135,752 (US$22,514) in 2012. Annual output of crude oil in the city reached 40m tonnes in 2012, while national oil consumption that year reached 477m tonnes oil equivalent (toe). Even so, the issue of economic sustainability has become a growing local concern. Annual oil production has fallen from 50m tonnes in the years up to 2003 to 40m tonnes since 2004. Oil companies are facing growing difficulties in extracting oil: 90% of the liquid extracted from the underground oilfield is currently water. We expect that growth over the near term will be supported by China's growing energy demand and the city's strategic position in China's energy planning. The domestic market is large: China overtook the US as the world's largest energy consumer in 2009, and demand is still growing as modern industry expands and living standards rise. We forecast that China's oil consumption will grow at a rate of 4.9% a year over 2012â€‘20, or around 30m toe a year. This will ensure immense opportunities for the oil industries in Daqing, as the consumption of other energy resources, such as nuclear and hydro, is still underdeveloped in China. Consumption of nuclear energy and hydropower stood respectively at just 0.8% and 2.3% of total energy consumption in 2012, compared with 18.6% for oil. Meanwhile, new oil extraction and refining techniques developed by a state-owned oil company, CNPC, should continue to raise extraction and processing efficiency. Daqing's oil output growth can be largely attributed to the application of new technologies developed by CNPC. The recovery factor is over 40%, around 10â€‘15 percentage points higher than similar oilfields in foreign countries. (The recovery factor is the ratio of recoverable oil to the total oil in place at the source.) Moreover, Daqing plays a key role in processing China's oil imports, sitting at the end of the Russia-China oil pipeline. In June 2013 Russia signed a US$270bn agreement to provide China with 46m tonnes of crude oil a year for the next 25 years. A substantial proportion of the Russian oil will be transported to Daqing, either for further processing or to be transferred to other parts of China. As China tries to diversify its oil imports in the name of energy security, Daqing's position will strengthen. Long-term risk abounds, however. The city's output is falling as its reserves shrink. New oilfields such as Changqing, on the border of Shaanxi, Gansu and Ningxia, pose a growing challenge. Currently China's second-largest field, Changqing possesses rich reserves of oil and natural gas (a much cleaner energy source), and is looking to replace Daqing gradually as the country's main energy production centre. In 2012 the Changqing field produced more than 45m toe of oil and gas, the highest level in China. At the same time, the nation's energy preferences are shifting from oil to cleaner substitutes such as nuclear power and natural gas. China is committed to limiting its carbon dioxide emissions, which necessitates lower dependence on oil. The current national 12th five-year plan (2011â€‘15) attaches great importance to environmental protection in the national energy strategy, and sizable investments are being made to boost capacity in these sectors. Energy price liberalisation is expected, which will have an impact on oil demand. The Daqing government has already started to plan for the inevitable exhaustion of its oil reserves. Local officials have given a preliminary estimate that this will take place in around 100 years. Value added from the oil and petrochemicals industries currently accounts for 72.2% of Daqing's industrial value added. The city has set a target in its local five-year plan of having more than 60% of total industrial output come from non-oil related industries. But even though the city is fuel-rich, it cannot necessarily leverage this to build up other heavy industries. In China, natural resources are state-owned assets. Daqing's oilfield is run and managed by CNPC, which is supervised by the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) of the State Council, China's cabinet. This means that the local government has little say over oil production and transaction decisions. The assurance of inflows from Russia should bolster the city's position as a processing and transport centre, but most of the oil produced in Daqing is handed over directly to the central government for reallocation. The extent to which the imported oil can contribute to Daqing's economic development depends on how much oil the city can keep for its own disposal. The local government has consequently indicated that it intends to develop the service sector. The plan for doing so includes a bit of everything-from services outsourcing to financial services. However, the success of any service sector depends on the availability of a sizable skilled labour force. Daqing lags behind in terms of education quality, with just eight tertiary education institutions, compared with 49 in the provincial capital, Harbin. Local officials interviewed by the EIU also lament that the long, cold winter reduces the willingness of workers (especially those in service sector) to move there. The current plan lacks focus. Daqing is a fairly new city, with only 30 years of history, and does not have a tradition in services. Its comparative advantages over other cities in this regard are not clear. Consequently, instead of trying to develop a wide variety of service subsectors, Daqing would do well to capitalise on its current market niche. For example, the city is already building an international petroleum information centre, which is a multi-functional financial service platform that processes oil production and transaction information worldwide. It also provides related financial services. These sorts of services, which can capitalise on the city's existing base of petroleum workers, will allow Daqing to continue in oil-related economic activities without depending on the substance itself. China's thirst for oil will support Daqing's growth in the short run, buying the city precious time to prepare for its looming economic transition. Instead of hastily rushing into the development of non-oil related sectors, it might do better to boost the quality of its labour force, find its market niche and build on its strengths.

C-SPAN Less than 10 hours before the federal government was set to partially shut down, the Senate voted Monday afternoon to kill both amendments passed in the House of Representatives on Sunday that would make significant changes to the Affordable Care Act.  The motion to table the House amendments — one that delayed Obamacare by a year, and one that repealed a tax on medical devices — passed by a party-line, 54-46 vote. That sends the continuing resolution back into the hands of the House. Unless House Speaker John Boehner agrees to bring the so-called "clean" Senate CR to the floor and rely on Democratic votes, the government will shut down. House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said Sunday that Republicans will look to pass a bill that would "have fundamental changes into Obamacare that can protect the economy for America." House Republicans are hashing out their strategy in a closed-door meeting Monday afternoon.  Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell floated the idea of a one-week bill to keep the government funded while a longer-term deal is negotiated. Many Democrats say the idea is a non-starter, and they question whether conservatives would accept the deal, as well. "A week would change nothing. The bill we are discussing is only 6-weeks long to begin with!!!" a Senate Democratic aide said.
Business InsiderAbout five weeks ago, I wrote a post about hedge fund manager Daniel Loeb's "pretty lame" triathlon times. Admittedly, the post was tongue-in-cheek. There's absolutely nothing lame about finishing a 70.3-mile race involving swimming (1.2 miles), biking  (56 miles) and running (13.1 miles) no matter how long it takes you, let alone running a hugely successful hedge fund at the same time. After writing that story, I decided to sign up for the "Mighty Man" Half Iron in Montauk. Loeb finished this race in 2011 with a time of 6:15:01 (3:02:44 bike and 2:20:30 run). I had never done a triathlon before. The race was scheduled for Sept. 29th, so I had only a few weeks to train. It's not like I started completely from scratch;  I lift weights about five to six days a week doing high intensity interval training.  I occasionally run 10Ks after work, too. As for the swimming, I grew up doing swim team from fourth grade until I graduated high school. Even though I had not been swimming lately, I still felt comfortable in the water.  What freaked me out the most ahead of the event was the cycling.  Before this, I had very little cycling experience.  The first time and last time I used a road bike was a 78-mile charity ride from Philadelphia to Avalon, N.J. on Memorial Day weekend. I crashed my bike during that ride and finished last.   After pushing myself for the last five weeks, I accomplished my goal yesterday by crossing the finish line. I finished the 1.2-mile swim in 38:38 (100th overall); the bike ride in 3:31:49 (228th overall) and the 13.1-mile run in 2:07:18 (146th overall).  My final time was 6:26:47. I came in 188th out of 265 athletes.  I didn't beat Loeb's 2011 time. And that's OK. There's always next year!  Competing in a Half Ironman was one of the greatest mental/physical challenges I've faced. It was also an incredibly humbling and gratifying experience.  I've included highlights from my journey in the slides that follow. I'm looking forward to doing another race. For now, I need to rest and recover. 
Mike Nudelman/Business InsiderReal men eat meat. At least that's the stereotype that has been passed down since our days as hunter-gatherers — when men (the hunters) would go off to kill wild animals, while women (the gatherers) would hang around collecting fruits, nuts, and berries. [See the successful men who don't eat meat] "Meat seems associated with strength and power, two features generally attributed to males," write the authors of a 2012 study published in the Journal of Consumer Research that examined why male consumers avoid vegetarian options. In another study, published in the journal Psychology of Men and Masculinity, researchers linked eating meat with "manhood, power, and virility" and found that men were more likely than women to "endorse pro-meat attitudes" and believed it was "human destiny to eat meat." But times are changing. A growing number of male business executives and political leaders, including former President Bill Clinton and Newark Mayor Cory Booker, are breaking gender expectations and embracing the vegetarian or vegan lifestyle. It's a trend — first pinpointed in a 2010 Businessweek article titled "The Rise of the Power Vegans" — that parallels mounting public awareness about the damaging effects of meat consumption on health and the environment. For some, the welfare of factory-farmed animals is also a concern. Conversely, "chick foods" like kale and soy products are growing in popularity. In the United States, vegetarians are still rare: Only 5% of American adults say they are vegetarian, according to a 2012 Gallup study, and just 2% of people consider themselves vegan — people who don't eat any ingredients that come from an animal, including eggs, milk, and honey. While the percentage of vegetarians has remained the same over the last decade, this pattern may slowly change as tofu and salads became more fashionable among America's male movers and shakers.
Estela, InstagramLast month, celebrated food writer Alan Richman wrote in GQ that New York City's Estela — a new restaurant in a city full of new restaurants — had "what could be the steak dish of the century." The claim was so huge it could not be ignored. We had to taste this steak — and not just because of our strong belief that steak should be its own food group. Specific dishes aside, Estela is packing some serious up-and-coming chef power. Ask your Brooklyn foodies, or your farm-to-table-slow-food-movement snobs who Estela's head chef, Ignacio Mattos is, and they'll tell you all about how he did five years of hard cooking time at Il Buco. Most importantly, he's known for bringing his own brand of what The New York Times' restaurant critic Pete Wells called a "deep, surrealist weirdness" to Isa, a Brooklyn Italian restaurant known for serving dishes that shocked your eyes and inspired your taste buds — things like fried sardine skeleton, or panna cotta served with honey harvested from beehives on Isa's rooftop garden. You can taste that oddness on the menu at Estela, and it's completely perfect. We got there for dinner around 8:30 p.m. on a Friday, and it was packed. Charlie Rose was seated at a table in the center of the warm dining room and the bar was crowded with drinkers. Estela, after all, is owned by Mark Connell, the same man who owns the dive bar below the restaurant (Botanica). His vision for Estela was an upscale wine bar, and it has that kind of friendly energy. So if you go there, be sure to drink the wine and go for a few small plates before your steak. We tried the calamari à la plancha with charred onion and romesco, the quail with fig, bread, and white beans, and the mussels escabeche on toast. foursquare, Siyun F.This is the charred calamari... it's divine.Try all of that. Mattos has an awesome way of making everything taste new. Estela's menu screams Mediterranean fare but close your eyes and you might not place it. Consider this a massive compliment. Surprises are not necessarily common for people who really love food. Steak lovers don't go for surprises either, for that matter. The general rules of steak purists are as follows — the steak should be a high-quality cut, seasoned with salt and pepper only, and then put on a grill until it's cooked medium rare. At that point, you have a glass of red wine and go to heaven. Not at Estela. The steak has a sauce, and you will love this sauce. The steak is cooked with leeks, eggplants, and anchovies, and you will love them too. These are not your steak-lovers' traditional rich, buttery sides (Think: creamed spinach or mashed potatoes). But that's fine, you won't even miss them. The eggplant has an acidic and charred flavor that perfectly complements the two pieces of rib-eye sitting on your plate and melting in your mouth. The saltiness of the sardines only makes the velvetiness of the steak more prominent. Basically, Richman nailed it. The purists may scoff at anchovies on a steak, but they shouldn't. This is magic.
APSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is floating a proposal that would, essentially, reset the shot clock on a government shutdown by a week.Â  McConnell's plan would fund the government for one more week, which would give the parties another week to work out their differences and come to agreement on a long term continuing resolution that keeps the government funded. But the idea was quickly shot down by top Senate Democratic offices. One senior Democratic Senate aide called it a "non-starter." The House probably wouldn't pass it, the aide said, because it wouldn't earn enough support from House conservatives or Democrats who want a longer-term "clean" CR to pass.Â  And besides that, the bill currently being debated would only fund the government through Nov. 15. "A week would change nothing. The bill we are discussing is only 6-weeks long to begin with!!!" the aide said. The government will shut down Tuesday if Congress does not agree on a continuing resolution to keep the government funded. On Monday afternoon, the Senate voted immediately to table both House-passed amendments to the CR that significantly chip away at the Affordable Care Act. The Senate Democratic aide also questioned why McConnell floated the idea to begin with, saying that House Republicans were "already dumping all over it" and conservative groups were shooting the idea down.
Investors during the early-2000s waited for the old growth story to re-emerge (i.e., the technology bubble), and generally ignored the sea change that was underway that favored credit-based assets such as emerging markets, commodities, gold, real estate, hedge funds, and the like. Todayâ€™s environment seems quite similar in that investors are again looking backward and hoping that the old, credit-based leadership re-emerges, while ignoring the major changes within the global economy. Most investors will readily agree that the global credit bubble is deflating. Yet, they continue to favor credit- based asset classes within their portfolios. The global sea change we have repeatedly mentioned seems well underway. If a US investor today wants growth, one needs to look only in oneâ€™s back yard. Who exactly is â€œprinting moneyâ€? Itâ€™s the emerging markets. Although it is very popular to say the US is â€œprinting moneyâ€, the reality is that US moneygrowth, at roughly 7%, is spot on the long-term average. The broad base of inflation figures beyond the much-maligned CPI consistently show that US inflation remains well under control. Not so in the emerging markets. Chart 1 shows the current relationship between money growth and inflation amongÂ  both developed and emerging countries. One can see that the highest rates of money growth and inflation are clearly in the emerging markets, and not in the developed markets. RBA It is curious that many investors still believe that the â€œemerging market consumerâ€ is a viable investment theme despite the growing number of protests and riots in the emerging markets. One would think that protests and, in some cases widespread civil unrest, in Brazil, Turkey, Egypt, Indonesia, China, India, and other countries would highlight that inflation is increasingly cramping emerging market consumersâ€™ purchasing power. How does one buy a toaster when one canâ€™t afford the bread? The odds of the emerging market consumer being a source for growth seem to be waning. Nonetheless, many investors remain enthusiastic about the EM consumer investment theme. Blind to the sea change Earning surprise data strongly suggest that analysts refuse to believe that the global sea change is underway. For more than a year, the majority of emerging market companies have produced negative earnings surprises. 56% of emerging market companies and 53% of BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) companies produced negative earnings surprises in the latest reporting period. The persistence of these negative earnings surprises suggests that analysts have been very slow to recognize the global sea change. Estimate revision data show analysts have been lowering estimates for emerging market companies, but they clearly have not been pessimistic enough. Chart 2 highlights the proportion of companies by region that have reported negative EPS surprises during the last quarter. One can see that the data for emerging markets is quite poor, especially relative to US results. RBA Where is growth? Although it might be hard to believe, the US and the developed markets are where the growth is today. Chart 3 shows 12-month projected earnings growth rates by region. Suffice it to say that the emerging marketsâ€™ growth is inferior. We have previously highlighted that small cap US stocks were forecasted to grow faster than emerging markets, but one can see that even large cap US stocks are now expected to be faster growers than emerging market companies. Contrarians might conclude Chart 3 demonstrates that expectations for the emerging markets are very low. However, Chart 2 suggests that â€œlowâ€ expectations could go â€œlowerâ€ RBA The global sea change continues Significant market volatility has historically always signaled a change in market leadership. The growth stories going into a period of volatility are rarely the growth stories exiting such a period. 2008â€™s stock market volatility has so far been a typical signal that growth stories were changing. Going into 2008, credit-related assets outperformed US stocks because of the global credit bubble. The deflation of the global credit bubble since 2008 has led credit - related investments to underperform US stocks. As Chart 4 points out, a global sea change is well underway, and our positioning will continue to reflect this new secular trend.

John Shearer/Invision/APImagesLebron James, the NBA two-time champion and four-time most valued player, teamed up with Swiss watchmaker Audemars Piguet to design a $51,500 limited edition watch. "I always liked watches growing up. When the opportunity presented itself it was easy to say yes," James told CNBC in Geneva, Switzerland, at the watch factory in late August. The watch, called the Royal Oak Offshore Chronograph, comes with an 18-karat pink gold case, black ceramic and diamond set push pieces, and a hand-stitched gray crocodile strap. Six-hundred of these watches went on sale at the end of September. (Read more: Rafael Nadal's $690,000 watch is now part of his game) "Anytime I do anything or have a partnership with anyone that has my name on it, I like to have a lot of personal trace in it," said James, whose signature is printed in blue on the sapphire crystal in the back of the watch. The Swiss watchmaker has a long history of working with athletes and has had partnerships with everyone from basketball legend Shaquille O'Neal to PGA golfer Keegan Bradley. "He [Lebron] is truly a unique person," said FranÃ§ois-Henry Bennahmias, CEO of Audemars Piguet. "When we met for the first time there was a good connection and we knew that we would do something together."Â  Â  James, an avid watch collector, said when it comes to his brand he's mostly focused on what he does best. "The Lebron James brand is built around basketball. If I'm doing what I need to do on the basketball floor at a high level everything else takes care of itself." Off the court, current sponsorships include Nike, Coca-Cola, Samsung and McDonalds. "I don't do partnerships with people that I don't use and don't have on a day-to-day basis," James said. "It has to speak volumes as to who I am as a person." Back on the court, he's not thinking about his future yet, "Miami has been great to me." (Read more: The $500,000 Nadal watch is now sold out) Â  James is focused on winning a three-peat, back-to-back-to-back championships, something last done by the Los Angeles Lakers in 2000-2002. "Who doesn't like success," said James. "If we stay hungry and motivated success will follow. There's a process on trying to be great and you can't cut corners doing it." Next summer, he could become the most sought after free agent if he opts out of his Miami contract. "Once I get to the point where I have to cross it I will handle it then."

The company started selling solar panels made by China's Hanergy in its store in Southampton on Monday. It will sell them in the rest of Britain in coming months, it said. A standard, all-black 3.36 kilowatt system for a semi-detached home will cost 5,700 British pounds ($9,200) and will include an in-store consultation and design service as well as installation, maintenance and energy monitoring service. "In the past few years the prices on solar panels have dropped, so it's a really good price now," IKEA Chief Sustainability Officer Steve Howard told The Associated Press. "It's the right time to go for the consumers." The solar panel investment will be paid off in about seven years for an average home owner in Britain, Howard said. "If you are going to be in your house that long, your energy will be free after seven years," he said. Some retailers in the U.S., including the Home Depot and Lowe's, already sell solar panels. But in other parts of the world, consumers often have to research a myriad specialist firms before making a purchase. Howard said IKEA aims to launch the products in other countries eventually. It picked Britain as its test market because it has the right combination of mid-level electricity prices and government-sponsored financial incentives that make investing in solar energy attractive to consumers. "This is a market by market decision," he said. The U.K. government offers private solar panel owners the opportunity to sell back electricity to the grid on days when they have surplus production and has a financing plan for solar power investments, which means residents can buy a system for no upfront cost and pay it off gradually.
REUTERS/Adrees Latif Hassan Rouhani"Everybody in Iran is hoping that Rouhani will come back with some good news about removal of sanctions from New York because the country can't survive otherwise," a Tehran industrialist told the Wall Street Journal in advance of the recent UN General Assembly. As we now know, Rouhani ended up coming back with a Tweet about a phone call. Not much, but it's something. At a minimum, the prospect of a thaw has put a scare into oil markets, which have come down about $2 since the prospect of a handshake between Presidents Obama and Rouhani was raised last week. In a new note, Morgan Stanley's Adam Longson says any curtailment of sanctions would put enormous amounts of crude back on the market. "If the US lifts Iranian sanctions, the sale of crude in storage may flood oil markets...While we are skeptical of any sudden resolution, any easing of Iranian sanctions would clearly be bearish for oil markets. However, we believe the risk to oil balances is not just a production restart, but also the significant volume of oil that may be sold from storage."  Despite production slowing down, Iran will YTD have expanded the amount of crude they have on storage by the equivalent of up to 2.5% of OECD crude stocks, Longson says. "A sudden return of these barrels could have a significant impact on global crude balances – beyond that of simply higher Iranian production," he writes. This could also mean a narrowing of the Brent-WTI spread, which has already seen increased tightness as new infrastructure continues to come online, he adds. Brent is down -0.5% today to $108.06.
I donâ€™t believe weâ€™ve ever met, though for several years our paths frequently crossed in Georgetown as we both walked to lunch. OfÂ course Iâ€™m a longâ€“time reader of your newspaper columns, gaining valuable insight from and agreeing with the vast, vast majority. Your writings on the Federal Reserve and monetary policy, however, land in that misguided minority.Â Take your most recent piece on the nomination process for new Fed chairman and the central bankâ€™s continued bond buying program â€” a failed effort, in your view. The final paragraph provides a good summary: The Fed has become the model of applied progressivism, under which power flows to clever regulators who operate independent of political control. The Fed is, however, a creation of Congress, which may not forever refrain from putting a bridle and snaffle on a Fed that increasingly allocates credit, wealth and opportunity. A few friendly observations: 1. That â€œbridle and snaffleâ€ you wish Congress to apply would be, I assume, a single mandate focused solely on price stability to replace the current dual mandate that demands the Fed also pursue maximum employment. In other words, you wish the Fed was more like the European Central Bank. But the ECBâ€™s policy has been a disaster in recent years. Unlike the Bernanke Fed, it has failed to offset the eurozoneâ€™s fiscal austerity with monetary easing. The US economy has been slowly growing since summer 2009 and adding jobs despite the most intense fiscal consolidation since theÂ Korean War demobilization. The eurozone, on the other hand, is only now emerging from a double-dip recession as unemployment remains at the worst levels since the start of the 2007 global recession. 2. The Fed isnâ€™t allocating â€œcredit, wealth, and opportunity,â€ itâ€™s merely trying to accommodateÂ excess demand for liquid assets, bonds, and cash in the aftermath of a series of economic shocks: the recession, financial meltdown, and euro-zone crisis.Â When a central bank fails to do this essential job of meeting money demand, as happened in 2008 globally, you get depressions or at least great recessions. If the Fed was creating a â€œsugar high,â€ inflation would be surging rather than quiescent. And equating low interest rates with easy money is a mistake.Â As Milton Friedman put it: â€œAfter the U.S. experience during the Great Depression, and after inflation and rising interest rates in the 1970s and disinflation and falling interest rates in the 1980s, I thought the fallacy of identifying tight money with high interest rates and easy money with low interest rates was dead.â€ 3. Speaking of Uncle Miltie, you seem completely unaware of the market monetarist school which has updated Friedmanâ€™s monetarist approach to monetary policy. Market monetarists â€” and they exist on the left and right â€” advocate the Fed target the path of nominal GDP and make up for any misses. While the Fed cannot much affect the US economyâ€™s potential growth rate, it can offset severe demand shocks and stabilize total spending in the economy with this rule-based approach to monetary policy. Economist Scott Sumner offers an excellent summary in this National Affairs essay, â€œRe-Targeting the Fed.â€Â I would also recommend ringing up Richmond Fed economistÂ Robert Hetzel.Â As Hetzel persuasively argues inÂ The Great Recession: Market Failure or Policy Failure, it was the Fedâ€™s tight monetary policy miscues after the 2008 downturn began that turned a run-of-the-mill recession into a once-in-a century disaster. 4. I guess my basic point is that the center-right approach to effective, rules-based monetary policy isnâ€™t just limited to the supposedly prewar Austrian (gold standard, business cycle) critique that you lay out in the column. (Friedman once said: â€œIÂ think the Austrian business-cycle theory has done the world a great deal of harm.â€) As I wrote recently in National Review: â€œThis is a critical period for economic thinking on the right. Itâ€™s reminiscent of the late 1970s when conservatives accepted economic reality and abandoned root-canal fiscal policy â€” recall that Barry Goldwater voted against JFKâ€™s supply-side tax cuts â€” for Reaganâ€™s pro-growth economics. Now itâ€™s time to reject a resurgence of root-canal monetary policy, too.â€ Best, James Pethokoukis
APA government shutdown beginning on Tuesday became a virtual certainty over the weekend. And the conventional wisdom holds in Washington that though the shutdown will be damaging, it could stave off a much bigger crisis â€” failure to raise the debt ceiling. The reasons for that are simple, if presumed: Wall Street will start freaking out, Republicans will start getting blamed, and the Tea Party caucus pushing forÂ something to be done about Obamacare will be satisfied with the fight over the government shutdown. But Democrats believe there's a huge caveat to that conventional wisdom.Â  "All that presumes that you have a sensible negotiating partner on the Republican side, and we know that hasnâ€™t been the case," one Senate Democratic aide told Business Insider. The aide said that if the government shuts down, Congress would likely dump together the two issues â€” the continuing resolution and the debt-ceiling hike. Resolving two issues in one sounds simpler, but could it actually make things even more complicated than they already are?Â  "Ha. Is anything easy for House Republicans?" the aide said. This is a view shared by many analysts in Washington who don't foresee the potential shutdown as something that will have a profound effect on Republican sentiments on the debt ceiling. Last week, Republicans unveiled the outline of a bill that contained a list of policy demands in exchange for a debt-ceiling hike. And even that fell apart because it didn't satisfy enough of the Republican caucus. Greg Valliere, an analyst at Potomac Research Group, warned in a note Monday that President Barack Obama might have to take drastic measures on the debt ceiling â€” like unilaterally raising the debt limit through the 14th Amendment.Â  And in a note entitled, "Winter Is Coming..." Guggenehim Securities' Chris Kreuger explained why a shutdown may not be enough to break the Tea Party "fever" on the debt ceiling: Negotiating a CR to keep the government open is a basic maintenance function that, from a policy perspective, is relatively easy (pick a date and a total spending number). The fact that the CR has become such a fiasco does not bode well for the far more intricate and complex issue of raising the nationâ€™s $16.7T debt ceiling in 17 days. Yes, a shutdown could cause some of the pressure in the House and Senate to be released, but it could also cause both sides to double down.Â The problem with a government shutdown is that it creates a type of zero gravity backdrop â€“ no one can quite predict what will happen once the lights go off.Â 
Stocks are tumbling today, and some pundits are blaming the impending U.S. government shutdown. But this wouldn't be the first time the government shut down. In fact, the stock market actually rallied during past shutdowns. Below is the chart for the S&amp;P 500 showing what happened in the double-barreled shutdown that started November 14-17, 1995 and then resumed December 16,1995 -January 5, 1996. "Counter-intuitively the S&amp;P 500 rose during both shutdowns, up 1.83% and 0.06%, respectively," noted Oppenheimer's John Stoltzfus. "Curiously enough a difference of opinion on the first shutdown was tied to issues that included Medicare premiums. The second shutdown was linked to a seven-year budget plan proposed by the White House" "Post the second shutdown the S&amp;P 500 rallied some 10.52% from January 10th through February 12th 1996," he added. Â  No reason to panic. Oppenheimer
REUTERS/Tony GentileDaniela Santanch talks to Silvio BerlusconiROME (Reuters) - About 20 Italian center-right lawmakers may break with leader Silvio Berlusconi if he tries to bring down prime minister Enrico Letta's coalition in a dispute over Berlusconi's fraud conviction, a center-right party source warned on Monday.              In a move that may give Letta, from the center-left, a chance to save his government following the resignations of five ministers from Berlusconi's People of Freedom (PDL), some 20 PDL senators will tell the party leader on Monday they may form a breakaway group in the upper house, the source told Reuters.              If Silvio doesn't agree to take a step back from what the hawks are proposing, we could have a new moderate group by Wednesday," the source said.              The comment slightly revived prices of Italian stocks and bonds, which have suffered from the prospect of new uncertainty and lack of economic reforms as former premier Berlusconi fights an impending expulsion from the Senate following his conviction. An inconclusive election in February led to the formation of a fragile left-right coalition under Letta two months later. Berlusconi's decision to order the five ministers to resign on Saturday has plunged Italy into political chaos and left the euro zone's third-largest economy without a fully operational government, prompting warnings that its sovereign debt rating is at risk. The move also deepened splits between hardline "hawks" and moderate "doves" in Berlusconi's party. A day after they resigned, all five ministers expressed reservations about their move, which came after a week of growing tensions. Other PDL lawmakers have also openly dissented with the resignations. Center-right lawmakers will meet Berlusconi at 5 p.m. (1500 GMT0 in what is likely to be a stormy encounter ahead of a confidence vote in parliament on Wednesday where Letta is openly counting on support from PDL dissidents. The source said the senators were ready to form a new conservative group separate from the center-right force that Berlusconi, a billionaire media magnate, has dominated ever since he entered politics in 1994. Letta, who has a commanding lower house majority, needs to secure a majority in the Senate - where the PDL is currently the second-largest party - in order to continue in government. As the political maneuvering in Rome gathered pace, Italy came under heavy international pressure with ratings agency Fitch warning that the crisis could trigger a cut in its BBB+ rating if it slowed efforts to rein in the budget deficit.  MARKETS FALL Letta's government has been teetering on the edge of crisis ever since Italy's top court convicted Berlusconi of tax fraud last month, opening the way for the 77-year-old to be stripped of his seat in the Senate. A special Senate committee meeting on Friday is expected to vote to open proceedings that could lead to Berlusconi being thrown out of parliament by mid-October and losing his parliamentary immunity from arrest in this and other cases. With Italy falling behind in its efforts to bring the budget deficit under European Union limits and youth unemployment running at nearly 40 percent, the prolonged wrangling between the parties has blocked efforts to reform the economy, after two years of recession. In Brussels, the European Commission said it was watching developments closely after the cabinet failed on Friday to pass measures needed to bring Italy's deficit under the European Union cap of three percent of gross domestic product. "We are following all developments in Italy very closely and out of respect for the internal democratic process in Italy, we are not going to make any comment at this stage," Commission spokeswoman Pia Ahrenkilde Hansen told reporters. Financial markets, which have been increasingly nervous about Italy after a week of rising political tensions, sold off government bonds and stocks on Monday, although there was no sign of the panic seen during other recent government crises. The main barometer of broad market sentiment, the difference between yields on Italian 10 year government bonds and triple A rated German Bunds, widened to 294 basis points, the highest in three months, while stocks on the Milan bourse fell 1.7 percent. The spread narrowed to 285 points on hope that Berlusconi might back down. Berlusconi said at the weekend he wanted new elections to be held as soon as possible, only months after the deadlocked ballot in February which left no party with the numbers in parliament to govern alone. But with opinion polls roughly balanced between Letta's center-left Democratic Party and the PDL, there is no enthusiasm for a return to the polls under the current voting system, which most analysts believe would simply produce more stalemate.

We expect this craziness to last into October and run up against the debt limit fight.Â  In the final gasping throes of squabbling, we expect President Obama to use the President Clinton designed executive order strategy so that the US doesnâ€™t default.Â  There will then ensue a protracted court fight leading to a Supreme Court decision.Â  The impasse may go that far.Â  This is our American way.Â  â€œMan Plans and God Laughsâ€ says the Yiddish Proverb.Â  But there is something else going on, and markets and investors are missing it. There is a change in foreign policy that has very broad implications. I will do my best to make the case. Our portfolios are being positioned for it. First, let me be up front and clear. I do not trust the Russians, the Iranians, the Syrians, or a whole host of other despotic regimes. I do not like them. I would not do my personal business with them. They do not respect property rights. They are ruthless and punish their citizens. That said, there is now underway a possible strategic shift that could have a massive beneficial impact. I have been, and still am, a harsh critic of some of President Obama's domestic economic policies, but this evolution has taken place in the realm of foreign policy, and its impact on domestic policy is a second derivative, albeit a very good one. Whether by accident, intent, or good luck, credit for the evolution in approach goes to President Barack Obama. In the playing out of the Syrian chemical weapons event and the hopeful, projected, uncertain, but possible change in the composition of the chemical weapons arsenal in Syria, we may achieve a positive outcome. This task will be difficult. I am not under any illusion that the players are honorable and forthright. They are not.Â  But if the Syrian chemical weapons arsenal is reduced or neutralized, wholly or in part, the existential threat to neighboring countries, including Israel, Jordan, and Turkey, will be diminished. A key purpose of Syria's chemical weapons arsenal has been, after all, to create the perception that the Assad regime (first the father and now the son) has the ability to inflict a highly destructive attack on neighboring countries, Israel and Jordan being two of them. There are other hopeful developments on the foreign-policy front, as well. Are we going to see a thaw in relations with Iran? Will there be some dialogue? It appears so. The first step has been taken. Are we being manipulated and played for an extension of time while centrifuges run and nuclear weaponry evolves at 20 sites in that country? Or will there be UN umbrella inspections of the 20 sites and a transition to peaceful use of nuclear power as a tool to generate electricity rather than to make weaponry? Of course the West is skeptical. Who can blame it? Will there be a thaw of some type that will ease tensions on the Korean Peninsula? Did the craziness perpetrated by the North Korean regime over the past several months inflict so much economic damage on the country that Kim Jong-un got a wake-up call? North Koreaâ€™s is a horrible regime. It severely punishes its citizens. But perhaps it now recognizes that it needs the economic support generated by the Kaesong industrial complex it shares with South Korea. If we look around the world, we see many dangerous trends and troubled countries. Our own natural and historical distrust makes us reluctant to engage with despotic adversaries. We worry that we are being played for fools. Does that mean the United States should reject such initiatives? We think the answer is no. If we confront these regimes through diplomatic channels, breakthroughs may be possible. Recall when President Richard Nixon opened up relations with China. We did not trust the Chinese then, and in many respects we do not trust them now. But we did pursue a thaw in relations that has contributed to several decades of peaceful changes in that country. That thaw created solid economic ties that may blunt military conflict, though it is unlikely to completely eliminate the prospect. China skeptics are less vocal today than they were when Chou En Lai and Kissinger launched negotiations. When Ronald Reagan expanded the US defense budget and put Russian oligarchs in the position of having to either match the expenditure or to open up their iron-fisted regime, he launched an initiative that led to the fall of the Berlin Wall and dissolution of the Warsaw Pact. Who would have forecast in the late '80s that Poland would be a member of the European Union just 15 years later, with a strongly growing economy? Who could have predicted that Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania would also be in the European Union and participating in commerce and trade with open borders? Could you have foreseen that the Czech Republic would have a peaceful revolution and throw the communist regime's yoke off its back by 1990? Could anyone have projected such developments before the Reagan initiative with Mikhail Gorbachev occurred? The answer is no. Can we give peaceful opportunity through diplomatic channels a chance? Are the foreign-policy initiatives we're witnessing a phenomenon that occurs in the second term of a presidency when the president is in trouble on domestic issues but has the opportunity to create a legacy in the international arena? It appears to us that President Obama has a bent towards passivism and seeks the diplomatic course when he can. With respect to the Syrian chemical weapons arsenal, the possibility for a diplomatic solution may have been handed to him by Vladimir Putin, of all people. Obama may seize it because he has no other choice. Whatever the reason, he seems bent on trying. The implication for financial markets may be huge if we can shrink the risk premia associated with military options. The minute a military option becomes a military action, massive, open-ended, hugely wasteful expenditures are mandated. Financing through debt or taxation quickly becomes necessary. Readiness for military action must of course be maintained, even as diplomatic solutions are being sought; but there is a great difference, both politically and fiscally, between maintaining readiness to wage war and actually waging it. We must not, however, let our readiness deteriorate because of our recent history in Afghanistan and Iraq, even as we seek diplomatic solutions. The key in the budget negotiations is not to weaken the underbelly of the US and its military. The key is not to undermine strategic US superiority. If anything, it should be strengthened. The message from our history is best illustrated by President Theodore Rooseveltâ€™s famous dictum: "Speak softly and carry a big stick." Rooseveltâ€™s policy is still apt today. Negotiate, and also keep in hand a stick that is huge and feared. Maintain the stick and do not undermine its strength. Markets, our economy, and our citizens will like that approach. Meanwhile, economic growth can pick up if diplomatic successes inspire a belief in the potential for diplomatic solutions around the world. We have been redeploying cash and taking advantage of selloffs to maneuver back into stocks. Our cash reserve is small, but still there. Our redeployment continues. We think the budget negotiations and debt-limit issue will all be resolved in our typical, dysfunctional American political way. The US will then continue its low-inflation, slow-growth recovery, while the military-option risk premium is likely to shrink. The bull market is not over. And the muni bond market remains cheap.

Ronald Martinez/Getty ImagesLATEST: The Dallas Fed's September report on manufacturing activity is out. The headline index jumped to 12.8 in September from August's 5.0 reading. Economists expected a smaller advance to 5.5. Below is the full text from the release: Texas Manufacturing Activity Picks Up Texas factory activity expanded in September, according to business executives responding to the Texas Manufacturing Outlook Survey. The production index, a key measure of state manufacturing conditions, rose from 7.3 to 11.5, suggesting output increased at a slightly faster pace than in August. Other measures of current manufacturing activity indicated continued growth in September. The capacity utilization index rose 6 points to a reading of 10.7. The new orders index was 5, largely unchanged from its August level. The shipments index edged down from 11.4 to 10.3. Perceptions of broader business conditions improved further in September. The general business activity index jumped nearly 8 points to 12.8, its highest reading in a year and a half. The company outlook index posted a fourth consecutive positive reading and came in at 7.9, little changed from August. Labor market indicators reflected continued employment growth but flat workweeks. The September employment index was 10, its third reading in a row in solidly positive territory. Seventeen percent of firms reported hiring new workers compared with 7 percent reporting layoffs. The hours worked index was near zero, indicating little change from August in average workweek length. Upward pressure on prices picked up in September, while wage pressure abated. The raw materials price index increased from 10 to 17.6, posting its highest reading in six months. The finished goods price index also rose notablyâ€”from 4 to 10.6â€”reaching a 19-month high. The wages and benefits index was positive but moved down to 9.7, its lowest level since early 2011. Looking ahead, 38 percent of respondents anticipate further increases in raw materials prices over the next six months, while 27 percent expect higher finished goods prices. Expectations regarding future business conditions remained optimistic in September. The indexes of future general business activity and future company outlook showed mixed movements but remained in strongly positive territory. Indexes for future manufacturing activity also remained solidly positive, and the index for future employment spiked 10 points to 21.9. The Dallas Fed conducts the Texas Manufacturing Outlook Survey monthly to obtain a timely assessment of the stateâ€™s factory activity. Data were collected Sep. 17â€“25, and 90 Texas manufacturers responded to the survey. Firms are asked whether output, employment, orders, prices and other indicators increased, decreased or remained unchanged over the previous month. Survey responses are used to calculate an index for each indicator. Each index is calculated by subtracting the percentage of respondents reporting a decrease from the percentage reporting an increase. When the share of firms reporting an increase exceeds the share reporting a decrease, the index will be greater than zero, suggesting the indicator has increased over the prior month. If the share of firms reporting a decrease exceeds the share reporting an increase, the index will be below zero, suggesting the indicator has decreased over the prior month. An index will be zero when the number of firms reporting an increase is equal to the number of firms reporting a decrease. Data have been seasonally adjusted as necessary.

We have spent a good bit of time in 2013 writing and talking about the phenomena that has centered around TSLA, its founder/CEO and the company’s product. After growing up in this business in the late '90s during a full fledged equity bubble, then subsequently suffering through the ensuing bear market left by the burst, I was fairly certain 10 years ago that it would take decades before we witnessed manias around “concept” stocks again. There were some very smart market participants back then that were certain that the valuations assigned to companies like AtHome.com, Webvan.com &amp; Pets.com were utterly ridiculous and that many of these stocks would ultimately go to zero (which many did), but placing bets as to when, turned out to be a very costly endeavor for most who attempted such a feat. Which brings me back to TSLA, I clearly recognize the price action since spring has been euphoric, almost what you would expect for a biotech company that demonstrated dramatic progress on a cure for cancer, but TSLA is just making really expensive luxury electric vehicles with the past assistance of government cash and addressable market that for now appears to be less than 1% of the world’s population. By now most of you know the story, the stock is up 463% year to date, has a market cap of $23 billion, close to half of GM’s, a 100-year-old car company that is expected to have $157 billion in sales this year, compared to TSLA’s expected $2 billion. Obviously these are not apples to apples comparisons as TSLA is trading on future growth prospects while GM may never again see double digit revenue growth. In late August back when TSLA was $167, I took a shot at buying very wide Put Butterfly (read here) with the idea that the upward momentum was faltering a bit as the stock consolidated below the previous highs. Well that didn’t work out (stock closed Friday at new highs ~$190) and as of this weekend I assure you this sort of trade in the name will not become a habit. Yesterday I had the pleasure of driving my friend’s Model S, and I've got to tell you, while I am not really a car guy this thing has the potential to cause insatiable demand by those from all walks of life. I am not going to get into the nitty gritty, but the this is the sort of finished product that I assume Steve Jobs might have traded in all of his iSuccess to have presided over. So here is the PSA, for those short sellers who want to dig in on this one, go test drive one; you may feel differently about your positioning if you can separate normal market behavior from reality. Obviously the product, the company’s financial prospects, and the stock’s behavior are all inter-related, and it is also obvious that there are massive disconnects between those three factors at the moment, but one thing is for certain, the product is AWESOME, in a way that true believers of the .coms in the late '90s were never able to experience from their beloved stocks. The main point here, is that who knows where this thing stops going up; the more people who buy this car the more ambassadors there will be for Musk, Model S and possibly the stock. The only real thing that my friend is pissed about his experience with TSLA is that he didn't buy the stock when he put the order in for the car in the spring. By the time he received delivery in August the car would have been paid for :) As for my trade, it was just a trade, I looked to spend as little premium as possible with defined risk on the narrow chance of a big reversal in a defined period of time. I will take these sorts of shots every so often, but not likely to do so again in TSLA anytime soon. Remember 26% of the shares outstanding are sold short, and the top five holders control 55% of those shares with Musk owning 26% of the total. Let's just say that I wish I had driven my buddy’s rig in August prior to my bearish TSLA trade, I would not have considered such a foolish endeavor. UPDATE: AFTER ENIS READ THIS, HE PROCLAIMED “THAT’S THE TOP!!”
REUTERS/Carlos BarriaChina just launched the Shanghai Free Trade Zone. The zone is a 29-square kilometer area that will allow for more liberalized financial transactions and easier foreign direct investment. While there has been a lot of excitement about what this means for economic liberalization we need to remember that there might be too much hype around it. Bank of America's Ting Lu explains that part of the problem with the FTZ is "the emphasis on replicability of reforms and opening up measures in the Shanghai FTZ could limit the scope of reforms within the FTZ." He also points out that some of China's most heavily needed reforms, like those of its state owned enterprises (SOEs), public finance, land ownership, and its Hukou (residency permit) system "won't be in the spotlight" in the FTZ. Societe Generale's Wei Yao argues along similar lines when she points out that interest rate and capital account liberalization along with currency convertibility "are taking a back seat in the experiment, at least in the initial stage." But she thinks this isn't necessarily a disappointment. "Any financial market liberalization concerning capital flows and/or financial market prices, if implemented only in a certain geographic area of an economy, would lead to arbitrage opportunities and, more often than not, to financial market speculation." Lu also doesn't think this will be a threat to the free trade zone (FTZ) won't be a threat to Hong Kong for two key reasons.  "We believe markets need to curb their enthusiasms if they hope the FTZ to become a strong competitor of HK, and the FTZ will rapidly unveil a new era of comprehensive reforms for the whole China," writes Bank of America's Ting Lu. Yao hits the nail on the head with the expectations surrounding the FTZ. "Like all previous economic experiments, this project is going to be a work in progress, subject to constant refinement."
BofA closes its long-Treasuries trade. "We recommended initiating tactical longs in the 5y (old 5s, T 1.5 08/31/2018) on Monday 09/23. We believed that increasing concerns about a shutdown, dovish Fed speak, a likely Yellen nomination, technical indicators and stretched short positioning were likely to lead to a near term rally in rates.  "This view has largely been realized over the last week with market concerns of a shutdown increasing and dovish Fed speak (Dudley and Evans) leading to likely capitulation of shorts. While shutdown risks remain high and a modest rally is still possible, the risk reward to outright longs seems more balanced at current levels, in our view.

REUTERS/ Tim Chong For the second straight week, we have a schedule chock-full of Federal Reserve speeches. "There's a lot to potentially move markets in this calendar, from a saloonful of Fed speakers through the week-ending payroll stuff," says UBS economist Art Cashin. Of course, we won't get to see that "payroll stuff" should the federal government shutdown at midnight, temporarily furloughing employees at the Bureau of Labor Statistics and other "non-essential" offices. Given that a "fiscal headwind" was one of Chairman Bernanke's chief reasons for delaying the taper of quantitative easing earlier this month, these 12 speeches will be particularly interesting if the government indeed shuts down.

Doug Pensinger/Getty ImagesThe September Chicago PMI report is out. The headline index advanced to 55.7 in September from August's 53.0 reading, exceeding consensus estimates for a smaller rise to 54.0. The report suggests the pace of expansion in manufacturing activity across Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan is accelerating. Below is the full text of the release: Led by gains in Production, New Orders and Supplier Deliveries, the Chicago Business Barometer gained 2.7 points in September to 55.7. The Barometer has gained in each of the past three months, the longest run of monthly increases for more than three years. Activity has recovered from Aprilâ€™s three year low of 49.0, although is still only consistent with modest economic growth. Gains in September Production levels, while healthy, followed a three month slide. New Orders were up for the second consecutive month to the highest level since February. Supplier Deliveries lengthened in September to their highest level since March. Order Backlogs rose marginally from August, but remained below the breakeven 50 level for the fourth month in a row. Employment softened for the third consecutive month and was the only barometer component to fall in September. Inventories continued to contract and Prices Paid fell substantially after rising in the past four months. Commenting on the MNI Chicago Report, Philip Uglow, Chief Economist at MNI Indicators said, â€œActivity picked-up again in September close to trend supported by New Orders and Production.â€ â€œWhile the pick-up is welcomed, growth is far from solid. The easing in the employment component is a notable setback this month, underlying the fragility of the recovery,â€ he added. Click here for the full release Â»
AP With no movement on either side and the debt ceiling fast approaching, there's increasing talk that the solution will be for Obama to issue an executive order and require the Treasury to continue paying U.S. debt holders even if the debt ceiling isn't raised. Here's Greg Valliere at Potomac Research: HOW DOES THIS END?Â  What worries many clients we talk with is the absence of a clear end-game.Â  We think three key elements will have to be part of the final outcome:Â  First, a nasty signal from the stock market.Â  Second, a daring move from Barack Obama to raise the debt ceiling by executive order if default appears to be imminent.Â  Third, a capitulation by Boehner, ending the shut-down and debt crisis in an arrangement between a third of the House GOP and virtually all of the Democrats.Â Â  Valliere isn't the only one seeing this outcome. Here's David Kotok at Cumberland Advisors: We expect this craziness to last into October and run up against the debt limit fight.Â  In the final gasping throes of squabbling, we expect President Obama to use the President Clinton designed executive order strategy so that the US doesnâ€™t default.Â  There will then ensue a protracted court fight leading to a Supreme Court decision.Â  The impasse may go that far.Â  This is our American way.Â  â€œMan Plans and God Laughsâ€ says the Yiddish Proverb. Indeed, back in 2011, Bill Clinton said he'd raise the debt ceiling by invoking the 14th Amendment rather than negotiate with the House GOP. This time around, again, Clinton is advising Obama to call the GOP's bluff.
APCrazy like a fox.For the past few weeks, I've been scratching my head about why a minority faction of one of our two political parties seems so determined to shut the government down. This group of extremists, known as "Tea Party Republicans," doesn't seem to care about the damage a shutdown will do to our fragile economy or confidence in our government. They also don't seem to care that the larger party they are members of, the once-admired Republican Party, will be tarnished by their selfish, irresponsible behavior. Instead, the Tea Party extremists just say that, because they don't like a particular piece of legislation, they are justified in shutting the whole government down. Grandstanding and brinksmanship are one thing, but the extremists who now control the Republican Party don't seem to be engaging in grandstanding and brinksmanship. Rather, they appear to be arguing that, any time a minority faction of our government is not given everything it wants by the rest of the government, it is acceptable to shut the government down. If this view of our government becomes accepted as non-crazy behavior, life in this country is going to get interesting in the next few years. Anyway, this position and attitude has been mystifying to me: Why engage in selfish, irresponsible behavior, hurt America and Americans, and destroy your political party's brand when you don't have to? Especially when even the Tea Party admits that the shutdown threat no longer has anything to do with the national debt! My colleagues have explained two of the reasons, namely that 1) Voting districts have been so successfully gerrymandered that Tea Party extremists are assured of being reelected even if they behave like selfish, irresponsible lunatics, and 2) the country has become more conservative in recent years. That helped me understand. But now, on the eve of the shutdown, the "giddy" behavior the Tea Party extremists are displaying is becoming even more comprehensible. Why? Because the first parts of the government that will be shut down are the parts of the government that the Tea Party extremists say they hate! Specifically: Meanwhile, the parts of the government that Tea Party extremists love will keep right on cranking:

APAmericans know who they will blame in the event of an increasingly likely government shutdown — Republicans who they consider "spoiled children." According to a new CNN/ORC poll released Monday morning, 46% said they would blame Congressional Republicans if the government shuts down beginning on Tuesday. By contrast, 36% would blame President Barack Obama, and 13% would blame both.  Participants in the poll were also asked whether they think both parties of Congress were acting like "responsible adults" or "spoiled children" over their respective positions. Respondents fingered Republicans as the most "spoiled" — 69% said Congressional Republicans were acting like children, compared with just 25% who say they're acting like adults.  Obama scored the best in this category — by a narrow, 49-47 margin, people think he's actually acting like an adult. Congressional Democrats are perceived as "spoiled children" by 58% of respondents. Monday is the final day for Congress to pass a bill that would avert a government shutdown — a prospect that doesn't look likely. The Senate on Monday is expected to reject two House-passed amendments meant to chip away at the Affordable Care Act. But House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said that if that does happen, House Republicans will look to move a new version of their continuing resolution that would make changes to the health-care law. About seven in 10 Americans say that a government shutdown would be a bad thing for the country — and that number rises to about 80% who say so about a shutdown that lasts for more than a few weeks.
flickr/corrine klugWithout a budget deal, the government will shut down at midnight. In its efforts to work out a deal, members of Congress are trying to negotiate terms related to Obamacare and the debt ceiling, which we will hit later in October. So, what does this do to the credibility of the U.S. in the eyes of its creditors. Goldman Sachs' Alec Phillips wrote about this in a August 16 note to clients. Standard &amp; Poor’s and Moody’s revised their outlook on the US rating from negative to stable earlier this summer, with AA+ and AAA ratings respectively. Given this, it seems unlikely that the debt limit debate would trigger negative ratings action from either agency unless Congress actually missed the deadline. Fitch has indicated that the projected level of US debt is slightly below the level it views as inconsistent, so a downgrade from them on fiscal fundamentals appears unlikely. However, for now Fitch maintains a negative outlook on the rating, and noted in June that “failure to raise the federal debt ceiling in a timely manner (ie. several days prior to when the Treasury will have exhausted extraordinary measures and cash reserves) will prompt a formal review of the U.S. sovereign ratings and likely lead to a downgrade.” Fitch’s review looks likely to be completed before year end, probably after the upcoming fiscal deadlines have passed. In the wake of the 2011 debt ceiling debate, the U.S. saw its AAA credit rating stripped by S&amp;P.  It's worth noting, however, that interest rates actually trended lower for two years. Here's a look at what the stock market did around recent "policy incidents." Goldman Sachs

REUTERS/Larry DowningThe U.S. Capitol dome is seen from the visitor's center on Capitol Hill in Washington during the week leading up to a potential U.S. government shutdown, September 27, 2013.(Reuters) - A partial shutdown of the U.S. government will begin at midnight on Monday if Republicans and Democrats fail to agree on a funding bill. In a government shutdown, spending for essential functions related to national security or public safety would continue along with benefit programs such as Medicare health insurance and Social Security retirement benefits for seniors. But civilian federal employees - from people who process forms and handle regulatory matters to workers at national parks and museums - would be furloughed. The last government shutdown ran from December 16, 1995, to January 6, 1996, putting about 800,000 federal workers on furlough. Here is a roundup of the expected impact of a shutdown. FEDERAL WORKERS Up to 1 million U.S. federal workers could face furloughs without pay beginning on Oct 1. Most federal agency workers would be furloughed, but a small number of "excepted" employees must continue to work. These include security workers such as air traffic controllers and prison guards. Congressional staffers could work if requested by the lawmaker or committee that employs them. Congress has previously paid federal workers for their furlough days. Federal workers could face penalties if they tried to do any work during the furlough. FINANCIAL MARKET CONSEQUENCES Apart from potential market swings, companies hoping to raise money in an initial public offering could face delays. Businesses will still be able to file certain documents to the Securities and Exchange Commission, but the agency said on Friday that processing and approving applications will be discontinued during a shutdown. "Capital-raising will have a huge hiccup if the SEC shuts down as it has said," said Eric Jensen, a partner with law firm Cooley LLP in Palo Alto, California. Drug companies waiting for a decision from the Food and Drug Administration could also see delays. The FDA said it would continue "limited activities" related to programs that are paid for by user fees from drug approval applications. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTORS A shutdown lasting less than two weeks would not hurt big defense contractors, which can survive temporarily without federal contract payments, said ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor's. But a longer shutdown could weaken the financial profiles and liquidity positions of smaller defense contractors. "It is felt a heck of a lot more keenly by small contractors," said Bradley Wine, co-chair of Morrison &amp; Foerster's government contracts practice. MEAT INSPECTORS Meat inspectors for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, considered necessary to national safety would stay on job. U.S. ARMED SERVICES All military personnel would continue in a normal duty status. But a large number of civilian employees would be temporarily furloughed, according to the Pentagon. Official furlough notices would be issued on October 1 if no agreement to fund the government has been reached. FEDERAL COURTS Federal courts will remain open for about 10 business days. By October 15, the Judiciary will need to provide more guidance. The Supreme Court, which is scheduled to start its fall 2013 session on October 7, declined to comment on whether it has plans for a government shutdown. But a court spokesman noted that in past shutdown situations, the court continued operating as normal. IRS The Internal Revenue Service has a major tax due date on October 15 for Americans who got an extension to file their 2012 taxes, which were due on April 15. The IRS will be accepting tax returns and other tax payments during a shutdown, but will suspend many other activities, including audits. About 90 percent of the IRS's 90,000 workforce would be furloughed, the agency said on Monday, meaning call centers would be closed and audits halted. HEALTHCARE LAW President Barack Obama's 2010 healthcare reform law is scheduled to debut on October 1 when people can start shopping for health insurance. Money to fund implementation of the healthcare law, known as Obamacare, has already been committed. (Complied by Washington bureau reporters.)
Flickr/Rob and Stephanie LevyBarring some last-minute miracle, it looks like the government is going to shut down at midnight tonight. The crux of the matter is that the House GOP is not inclined to pass a budget that doesn't include some kind of delay or defunding of Obamacare. And obviously Democrats won't agree to that. So, impasse. Markets are already falling, it would seem, on the news. But there are reasons to think this would be good. Goldman explained why this could be helpful in a note to clients last Friday: It would be a mistake to interpret a shutdown as implying a greater risk of a debt limit crisis, in our view. It would not be surprising to see a more negative market reaction to a shutdown than would be warranted by the modest macroeconomic effect it would have. We suspect that many market participants would interpret a shutdown as implying a greater risk of problems in raising the debt limit. This is not unreasonable, but we would see it differently. If a shutdown is avoided, it is likely to be because congressional Republicans have opted to wait and push for policy concessions on the debt limit instead. By contrast, if a shutdown occurs, we would be surprised if congressional Republicans would want to risk another difficult situation only a couple of weeks later. The upshot is that while a shutdown would be unnecessarily disruptive, it might actually ease passage of a debt limit increase. This seems kind of vague, but there are three distinct reasons it could be a positive. Not everyone shares this view. Molly Ball writes persuasively in The Atlantic that there's no reason to think a shutdown could "cool the fever," so to speak. And indeed people have predicted many times (incorrectly) that the GOP fever had finally broken. But there are at least three forces that will kick in starting now to help create the situation that will allow Washington to get past the debt ceiling.
Flickr/kthreadFolks who continue to expect inflation to pop up around every corner continue to be... wrong. There's basically none. Anywhere. Here's the latest from Eurostat. Euro area annual inflation is expected to be 1.1% in September 2013, down from 1.3% in August, according to a flash estimate from Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union. Looking at the main components of euro area inflation, food, alcohol &amp; tobacco is expected to have the highest annual rate in September (2.6%, compared with 3.2% in August), followed by services (1.5%, compared with 1.4% in August), non-energy industrial goods (0.3%, compared with 0.4% in August), and energy (-0.9%, compared with -0.3% in August). Cullen Roche points out that it's the same story everywhere. Japan, the US, the UK, etc. Inflation is incredibly subdued despite what you hear about central banks pumping money like crazy. All that being said, the hardcore inflationistas have long been discredited. Now the folks at risk of looking silliest are the people who were convinced that the central banks could stoke inflation if they wanted to. They're on the verge of being discredited as well.
REUTERS/ Jonathan ErnstAfter the Fed declined to reduce the pace of its bond purchases at its September meeting, a bunch of folks predicted we'd see "Octaper", meaning the tapering of purchases would come in October.Â Main That now seems incredibly unlikely. Between the likely government shutdown and the debt ceiling fight, it's virtually impossible to imagine the Fed adding to the chaos by taking a tightening stance. Oh, and SocGen points this out: ...a government shutdown could interrupt the flow of economic data. At such a critical time, when the Fed has made clear that any decision on tapering will be data dependent, that means no data, no decision. Can't have the Fed making such a crucial decision flying blind with no government data being reported.
The debt ceiling negotiations are turning into another circus as Congress appropriates spending and then uses the debt ceiling to threaten a government shutdown after the factâ€¦.But something will come to the rescue here and force these circus performers to get their act together. Â  And the one thing that is guaranteed to get the millionaires in Congress to act is seeing their own silly actions cause the stock market to go down. So, here we are with futures down sharply on news of a government shutdown. Â Letâ€™s see how long the millionaires in Congress can hold out as their own actions actually reduce their own net worthsâ€¦.My guess is this will get their attention pretty quickly.
APNot surprisingly, markets are ugly today. Pretty much everywhere. In Japan, the Nikkei ended down over 2%. German stocks are down over 1%. Same with Spain. Italian stocks are down nearly 2%. US futures are down a bit less than 1%. Over the weekend there were two major developments. One is it looks virtually certain that the US government is going to shut down. There appears to be no chance, right now, that the GOP-controlled Congress can pass a budget that doesn't contain a defunding or delaying of Obamacare, which is obviously something the White House would never accept. So that's not a positive. And then in Italy, Silvio Berlusconi's party has announced its deserting the government's coalition, forcing Prime Minister Enrico Letta into a confidence vote later this week, which he might lose possibly throwing the country into political chaos. And to top that all off, Chinese official PMI last night was weaker than expected.
