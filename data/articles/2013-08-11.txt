REUTERS/Issei KatoStock markets in Asia opened lower after Japan's latest GDP print missed expectations by a mile. The Nikkei is off -1.25%. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 has fallen -0.07%. Korea's Kospi opened down -0.13% but has since recovered to +0.58.
DVIDSHUB/FlickrJapan's Q2 GDP growth missed expectations, hitting 2.6% against 3.6% expected. The Yen hit $96.04 against $96.33 prior to the data print, MarketWatch's Michael Kitchen says. The Nikkei is also off -1.26%. Seasonally-adjusted GDP climbed +0.6% against Q1's +0.9%. As we recently explained, Japanese economic data has been doing a lot of missing expectations lately. Industrial production, household spending and July PMI all fell short.  Plus, July employment fell for the first time in three months. Abe-nomics — the loose monetary policy ordered by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to reinflate Japan's economy — have now been in place about half a year. Clearly, something's not working.
REUTERS/China.org.cn/Handout British businessman Neil Heywood poses for a photograph at a gallery in Beijing, in this handout picture dated April 12, 2011. China's Communist Party has suspended former high-flying politician Bo Xilai from its top ranks and named his wife a suspect in the murder of Heywood, a dramatic turn in a scandal shaking leadership succession plans. The mother of a British national whose murder in China upended the country's ruling class has gone public with her demand that her family receive financial compensation for the death. Ann Heywood has submitted a statement to Jeremy Page of the Wall Street Journal indicating Neil Heywood's two children, 8 and 12, lack adequate resources for their future. Neil Heywood is presumed to have been murdered by the wife of Bo Xilai, the former head of the Chongqing branch of the Communist Party and a once-"rising star" within the country's leadership ranks. Bo was later purged from the party after accusations of a cover up regarding his wife's involvement in the incident. The British government was also criticized over its handling of the case. Here's a portion of Ann Heywood's statement to Page: Given the circumstances of Neil's murder, I have been surprised and disappointed that, despite repeated discreet approaches to the Chinese authorities, there has been no substantive or practical response. I hope and trust that the leaders of this great nation, which Neil loved and respected, will now show decisiveness and compassion, so as to mitigate the consequences of a terrible crime and to enable my family finally to achieve some kind of closure to our ongoing nightmare. There remain lots of unanswered questions surrounding the case, including the fact that no autopsy was performed. Page reports Neil Heywood's wife, Lulu, is thought to still be in China.

Futures markets have re-opened to begin the week, and gold is surging. The shiny yellow metal is up 1.4% from Friday's close in Sunday evening trading at right around $1330 an ounce. Meanwhile, silver is up 2.6%, and S&amp;P 500 futures are 0.2% lower. The chart below shows the nice bounce in gold futures tonight. Thinkorswim "With the yellow metal holding 1270, we look for a base and resumption of the larger bull trend for 1410, potentially 1450," wrote BofA Merrill Lynch technical strategistÂ MacNeil Curry in a note to clients Friday. "A close above 1328 confirms." BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, CQG
At Cumberland, there have been a number of strategy changes. Clients are aware of these changes by observing the activity in their accounts. We will summarize here the strategy changes and the reasons for them. Expect further commentaries on these matters as we keep you apprised of factors affecting the market and our timely responses to changing conditions. We have raised cash in both US and international equity accounts. The bottom line is that the risk profile in stock markets is up. There are questions about the pace of economic recovery, some of the sectors such as energy or housing, and the impact of the Fedâ€™s talk of tapering and what it is doing to risk premia and re-pricing in the market. The possibility of a Summers Fed chairmanship, coupled with Elizabeth Dukeâ€™s departing, Jerome Powellâ€™s term ending next year, Sarah Bloom Raskinâ€™s leaving for the Treasury, and Janet Yellenâ€™s departing (If she is not appointed chair?) , leads market agents to conclude that an entirely different configuration of the Fed board may soon be at hand. Add to that the retirements of some of the seasoned presidents (Cleveland Fed president Sandra Pianalto has announced), and the structure of the US central bank may reach a point where the remaining experienced and historically seasoned members of the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) are few. New observers and appointees may have seen the financial crisis from the outside; however, they will not have acquired firsthand the knowledge and experience gained only through making decisions under fire. Markets are aware that they face the biggest US central bank transition in many years. Bond markets have backed up in yields. This is true in the Treasury, municipal and taxable bond markets. We have written about how yields have been distorted and yield spreads have widened enormously. Our example was a trading day in which the 30-year US Treasury obligation (federally taxable) traded at 3.62% yield. In the same 24-hour period, the tax-free New Jersey Turnpike traded at 4.73% yield, and the taxable New Jersey Turnpike traded at 5.15%. In our view, the tax-free turnpike bonds are screaming bargains in the present climate. In fact, Cumberland owns them in clientsâ€™ accounts. Risk management issues loom larger than usual. What do you do when the stock market has reached your next yearâ€™s target? Our target was the S&amp;P 500 at 1700 by the end of 2014. We are there. What do you do when the outlook for earnings is starting to deteriorate? We have ratcheted back our S&amp;P 500 estimates for this year by a couple of dollars. We still think that earnings will come in around $110, give or take $2. The picture is trending toward more softness in earnings growth. What do you do when the outlook for the future earnings growth rate is also deteriorating? We base that assessment on the fact that the profit share of the GDP in the US is at the highest level it has seen in decades and the labor share is at the lowest level. That means productivity seems high and earnings that come from that profit share seem to be strong. Could the profit share go higher? Yes it could. Is that likely now? We think not. Furthermore, the ratio of the value of the entire S&amp;P 500 index to the GDP has reached 100%. History (Ned Davis database) suggests that this is a dangerous level. We think the profit share of the GDP is rolling over, peaking, and tipping into what might be a long-term decline from this very high level.Â  And the labor share may be bottoming and is positioned now to start a gradual rise over time from this very low level.Â  If this view is correct, then American companies begin to face headwinds that will slow the earnings growth rate. This is not just a day-to-day, week-to-week or month-to-month rate of change.Â  This is strategic. What lies before us is a longer-term stretch in which the tremendous benefit to American business from central bank policy in the post-crisis period will come to an end. Lastly, there is the issue of demographic headwinds. Rob Arnott, a guest at Leenâ€™s Lodge this year, has offered thoughtful analysis on demographics. He notes, in his serious research, how strongly demographics have contributed, in the past, to accelerating growth rates, and he forecasts significant headwinds that demographic change may introduce into our strategic future. Put that package together and there emerges a set of circumstances in which stocks, having risen terrifically, now look less appealing at the current price level. Certain sectors of the bond market, by contrast, look more appealing. Consider that New Jersey Turnpike 4.73% tax-free yield. We sat in a meeting with one of our New Jersey clients and reviewed his portfolio. The client is a successful businessman. He was joined in the meeting by his financial professional. We dissected his New Jersey tax bracket. He is somewhere in the 51%-52% marginal tax bracket. He is a New Jersey resident paying federal income taxes and New Jersey taxes at the top rates. He bumps up against levels which limit his deductions and expenses when he completes his tax return. And we must add the Obamacare tax he pays. That is how his marginal tax rates reach 52%. Sitting in that meeting, we took apart 4.73% as a yield that he can obtain by investing in a long-term debt instrument with a senior claim on the revenues of the New Jersey Turnpike. The compounding taxable equivalent yield for him is approximately 9.5%. He can get that yield year after year. What that means is that, to scrape up a viable and comparable investment alternative, he would have to find an investment somewhere else deriving a taxable income of 9.5% and pay all of his taxes on that percentage. The residual would equal the return generated by the New Jersey Turnpike instrument. Where are you going to find such a low credit risk, high quality, and liquid investment in New Jersey to compound at a 9% or 9.5% rate pretax so that you can derive a match against the New Jersey Turnpike? I cannot see any, and neither can he. That is why we allocated in favor of his tax-free bond portfolio. Do the same math with some long-term holding and use the 20% capital gains rate. Add Obamacare tax and add NJ taxes. The case for the New Jersey Turnpike tax-free bond is still very compelling. We have changed our internal asset-allocation mix at Cumberland Advisors. In the beginning of this cycle, we were as high as 80% stocks in balanced accounts. That allocation has been reduced to 60%. We have taken the bond piece up to 40%. Furthermore, we have extended duration in individually managed accounts. The entire hubbub over Detroit, San Bernardino, and other specific tax-free municipal bond credit issues has provided an entry opportunity in the tax-free municipal bond market that is unparalleled except for one other time. I would characterize that other time as the "Whitney moment," when Meredith Whitney went on 60 Minutes and predicted the end of the municipal bond world. Letâ€™s call this current time the Whitney-esque moment. We are buyers of tax-free bonds. We have a cash reserve in our US equity and international ETF accounts. That cash reserve is higher than it has been in our accounts in quite some time. And we are going to hold that cash reserve on the sidelines for a time. We cannot say how long and we do not know when or how much will be redeployed. We are now facing the transitional period for the central bank. We do not know who the next chairman is going to be or what the composition of the board will be. But we do know that the current wave of uncertainty will soon be cresting into decisions sure to have cascading consequences in churning markets. We have seen a lineup of commentary coming from FOMC members that suggests a form of tapering is coming. We are not afraid of tapering. Tapering by itself is not an issue if it is coupled with an extension of the short-term interest-rate commitment. In other words, the Fed can cut the rate of additional purchases and use guidance to extend the period before and until the Fed Funds rate will be elevated from its present 0.0%-0.25% range. Some members of the FOMC are thinking that tapering means reducing the amount of stimulus but extending the time period in which it is applied. If the market grasps that concept, bonds will rally, and tax-free bonds even more so. Think about it. If the inflation rate in the US is roughly 1% and there is a possible downward trend, then a 4.73% tax-free New Jersey bond is delivering a real return of 3.73% after taxes to a New Jersey resident. That is a phenomenally high return on an investment for someone living in New Jersey. The real return is still quite high if the inflation rate heads up to 2%.Â  This is now a win-win for an individual investor. There are similar opportunities in jurisdictions throughout the US. To sum this up, carefully selected bonds now offer an entry opportunity and long duration. It is critical to check the quality of credits, particularly in the municipal bond market. Stocks require selectivity as to sector activity and many other characteristics. We have had terrific success in our US ETF portfolios this year. We do not want to give those strategically achieved profits back. So we now have a cash reserve until we get through this difficult period.
Vivian Giang / Business InsiderVeterans David Chambers, Danielle Miklos, and Arash Asady walking through the trading floor. High unemployment among veterans is exactly what Duncan L. Niederauer, CEO of the NYSE Euronext, wants to end. Last year, Niederauer launched the NYSE Veteran Associate Program, a 10-week paid internship program that offers veterans hands-on experience and training alongside a NYSE staff. In its sophomore year, the program has 29 vet interns from the ages of 23 to their mid-50s. The program addresses a serious problem. Military personnel who served in Iraq or Afghanistan had an unemployment rate of 10.9% in August 2012, whereas the overall unemployment rate in the U.S. at the time was 7.9%, according toÂ the BLS. Niederauer doesn't think he can solve high unemployment by hiring every veteran who comes through the program. He's hoping the NYSE can serve as an example to the thousands of companies listed under the public institution. "Other companies can do similar programs," Niederauer said in a press release about the program. "They can start hiring and understanding a veterans' background has great transferable skills." For the first two weeks of the internship, the veterans are in classrooms listening to economists and influencers lecture. Then, for the remainder of their internship, participants are assigned to specific roles where they work side by side with the NYSE staff. Vivian Giang / Business InsiderFormer combat veteran Mark Otto, now managing director of J.Streicher & Co., shows veteran interns David Chambers, Arash Asady, Danielle Miklos, and Charles Reeder the ropes."The aim is to give them exposure and visibility," Ed Hutner, senior vice president of human resources at the NYSE, told Business Insider. "They get a really good overall idea of how the Exchange operates and this will hopefully give them a platform." Hutner said the chaotic environment that comes with working at the Stock Exchange makes sense for former military personnel as they're typically accustomed to multitasking. "Weâ€™re not asking these vets to come in here to know everything about a certain job. They have leadership and motivation. We can train you on the technical skills." Business Insider was invited to spend time on the trading floor with a few veteran interns. Here's what they had to say: After two tours in Afghanistan, Chambers was discharged from the Marines in July 2012 where he served as an intelligence collector. Vivian Giang / Business InsiderFormer Marine David Chambers wants to become a corporate attorney.Chambers speaks fluent Afghan Pashto and his job while in uniform was to intercept and translate enemy communications. By the end of his service, Chambers was fully aware of unemployment statistics for men like him. He decided to enroll in school for international affairs at Columbia University. It was through a Veterans Association at the university that Chambers found out about the NYSE's program. Currently, Chambers is working in the Stock Exchange's compliance unit where he monitors market, systems, and corporate compliance policies. In short, his job requires surveillance of the market and investigating any glitches. "It's an incredible stepping stone," Chambers said. "If you're interested in learning about a different division, you can reach out and help them out." Chambers plans on attending law school to become a corporate attorney with a focus on security regulations. For seven years, Miklos was a motor mechanic in the U.S. Army. After that, she was an attorney for the next four years. Then, she learned about the internship program with the NYSE and dropped everything. Vivian Giang / Business InsiderDanielle Miklos would â€œlike to help regulate the securities industry.""The Stock Exchange is one of the most intimidating places," Miklos said. "It's one thing to be on the battlefield. It's another thing to be in a place with the brightest people." The former service woman currently interns in Global Risk Services at NYSE and told Business Insider that there are several skills that you learn in the military that's transferable to the corporate world. "We pay attention. We dress appropriately. We're on time. We're trained to think about the bigger picture." Asady joined the Marines right out of high school and stayed in for the next five years working with signal intelligence. Vivian Giang / Business InsiderArash Asady wants to work at an internationally-focused hedge fund that specializes in M&A transactions, debt restructuring opportunities, and credit markets.When he re-entered civilian life, Asady finished his undergraduate degree and worked in private equity in Silicon Valley. He recently moved to New York City for a master's program at Columbia University. "It's been an amazing program so far. You get to network and mentor with so many bright people." Asady currently works on the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange and wants to eventually work with a hedge fund. Lisa L. Dzintars-Pahwul, managing director of human resources at the NYSE, told us that the program has been successful since the beginning. Half of the first-year candidates went on to jobs in government and finance whereas the other half returned to school to finish their degrees. "We treat recruiting interns like we do full-time candidates," Dzintars-Pahwul said. "Everything that vets bring, from responsibility to loyalty, makes them successful candidates." "We encourage the thousands of listed companies to follow our example in creating programs for veterans."
WikimediaThere are those who would convince you that it is somehow smart or in your best interest to be manically switching your investments around, back and forth, long and short, on a daily basis. To pay attention to this kind of overstimulation is the height of madness, even for professional traders. The most storied and important trader who ever lived, Jesse Livermore, would be tuning these daily buy and sell calls out were he alive and operating today. Because while he was a trader, he was not of the mindset that there was always some kind of action to be taking. Jesse Livermore's legacy is a bit of a double-edged sword... On the one hand, he was the first to codify the ancient language of supply and demand that is every bit as relevant 100 years later as it was when he first relayed it to biographerÂ Edwin LefÃ¨vre. Livermore himself sums it up thusly:Â "I learned early that there is nothing new in Wall Street. There canâ€™t be because speculation is as old as the hills. Whatever happens in the stock market today has happened before and will happen again. Iâ€™ve never forgotten that." On the other hand, Livermore's undoing came at precisely the moments in which he ignored his own advice. After repeated admonitions about tipsters, for example, Jesse allowed a tip on cotton to lead to a massive loss which grew even larger as he sat on it - violating yet another of his own cardinal rules. And of course, other than for a few moments of temporary triumph in the trading pits and bucket shops of the era, Jesse Livermore was not a happy man. "Things haven't gone well with me," he informed one of his many wives by handwritten note, beforeÂ putting a bullet through his own headÂ in the cloakroom of the Sherry-Netherland Hotel. But he did leave behind a wealth of knowledge about the art of speculation. His exploits (and cautionary tales of woe) have educated, influenced and inspired every generation of trader sinceÂ ReminiscencesÂ was first published in 1923. In my opinion, some of the most useful bits of knowledge we get from the book concern Jesse's discussion of timeframes and patience. Many traders, particularly rookies, approach the game with the idea that they're supposed to be constantly doingÂ something -Â in and out, with a trembling finger poised to click the mouse again and again. Â Consequently, they get on the treadmill of booking wins and losses without ever really moving the needle. They end up with tons of brokerage commissions and taxes to show for their efforts, but not much else. Being a trader doesn't mean one must always be executing a trade, just as being a house painter doesn't mean that every surface needs an endless series of coats. Many rookies are surprised to learn that Livermore, the idol of so many great traders, advocated a lower maintenance, higher patience approach as he matured. In his early days, Livermore was dependent on the short-term funding and scalping activity of the bucket shops. Once he graduated and had his own capital, he was able to lengthen position holding times and could even afford to do nothing for extended periods. Here are nine surprising things Jesse Livermore said regarding excessive trading: 1. "Money is made by sitting, not trading." 2. "It takes time to make money." 3. "It was never my thinking that made the big money for me, it always was sitting." 4. "Nobody can catch all the fluctuations." 5.Â "The desire for constant action irrespective of underlying conditions is responsible for many losses in Wall Street even among the professionals, who feel that they must take home some money everyday, as though they were working for regular wages." 6. "Buy right, sit tight." 7. "Men who can both be right and sit tight are uncommon." 8. "Don't give me timing, give me time." and finally, the most important thing: 9.Â "There is a time for all things, but I didnâ€™t know it. And that is precisely what beats so many men in Wall Street who are very far from being in the main sucker class. There is the plain fool, who does the wrong thing at all times everywhere, but there is the Wall Street fool, who thinks he must trade all the time. Not many can always have adequate reasons for buying and selling stocks daily â€“ or sufficient knowledge to make his play an intelligent play." Jesse was a trader but he knew the value of staying with positions and sometimes not trading at all. Once he began to follow tips from others or trade when he should have abstained, all of his progress had come undone, and with it, his sanity. We are fortunate to be able to learn from his mistakes and to sidestep the errors that eventually cost him everything.
But what exactly is it? How does it work? How secure is it? What are its advantages (and disadvantages) to sovereign fiat currencies? To precious metals? In this week's podcast, Chris talks with Gavin Andresen,Â chief scientist of the Bitcoin Foundation and lead developer for its digital currency project. Bitcoin really is a new kind of money. It is a new concept in how you can 'do' money, in that it is a virtual or digital currency that isn't issued by a central bank. It isn't created by some central corporation. Instead, everyone who is participating in the Bitcoin network â€“ so everybody who is running the Bitcoin software on their computer in communicating over the network with other people who are running the Bitcoin software â€“ all of those people together collectively perform the functions that a central bank would typically perform. Those people all create the currency. Those people all make sure that the transactions that happen are valid and that invalid transactions are rejected. So collectively, together, everybody who is running the Bitcoin software makes the system work. And that makes it very resilient, really. It is resistant to central control. It is resistant to manipulating the money supply. It is resistant to censorship. It is resistant to a lot of other bad things that have happened with our traditional fiat currencies.Â  Bitcoin is also like cash. If you own some Bitcoins and you are holding some Bitcoins in your digital wallet then that is like holding physical cash in your physical wallet. If somebody steals that wallet, then they have got your Bitcoins. You asked, will I lose all of my money if a server crashes? That is not an issue. All of the tens of thousands of Bitcoin miners looking for Bitcoin actually hold a record of all the transactions that have happened on the Bitcoin network. There is no one single server that can crash and take all of your Bitcoins away. It is very distributed and reliable in that way. But again, you are responsible for holding what I call your â€˜private keysâ€™ that let you spend your Bitcoins. And if you lose your private keys, either to a hacker attacker, or if your computer crashes and you didn't have a backup of your keys, then you can lose your Bitcoins. I think Bitcoin will be an answer. I still tell people, only invest time and money into Bitcoin that you can afford to lose. It is in early adopter stage. I would still consider it a high-risk investment, if you want to think of it as an investment. It could be really huge. I think there is no theoretical reason why Bitcoin couldn't grow as large as some of the major national currencies. There is really no technical reason why it couldn't and no theoretical reason why it couldn't. There is a huge network effect with money. The more people using a means of exchange, the more valuable it becomes to use that thing as a means of exchange. That is why gold is king, and not platinum or silver. There has been a huge network of people finding gold to be a great stored value, and in certain situations, a means of exchange. Bitcoin has a huge head start on any other alternative. We are still really at the early adopter phase. We have been since Bitcoin started. Adoption is actually happening pretty quickly. Right now, all of the Bitcoins in the world are worth somewhere over a billion dollars. That gives you a sense of scale on how big the Bitcoin economy is. Last year I was doing some research and I was looking at how big is Bitcoin relative to some of the smaller, national fiat currencies. They assumed that Bitcoin was probably smaller than any other national currency. And to my surprise, I actually found out that there are some small nations where the national currency is worth less than BitcoinÂ  Click the play button below to listen to Chris' interview with Gavin Andresen (35m:41s): Click here to read the full transcript
REUTERS/Jessica RinaldiA pair of boxer shorts belonging to Bernard Madoff are displayed by an auctioneer during a media preview of the U.S. Marshals Service 'Madoff II Auction' in the Brooklyn borough of New York, November 10, 2010.NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bernard Madoff was in a "love triangle" involving one of five former employees who are about to go on trial for helping him run his multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme, prosecutors said. Madoff pleaded guilty in March 2009 to running a fraud of up to $65 billion at his investment firm and is serving a 150-year prison sentence. While Madoff said he acted alone, prosecutors have since charged 13 individuals in connection with the fraud. Five of them - two women and three men - are set to go on trial in federal court in New York on October 7. In a filing with the court on Thursday, prosecutors said the married Madoff was involved with one of the five but did not give a name. All but one of the defendants were at one time involved in relationships with each other, and one had a relationship with Madoff, the prosecutors said. "For example, one of the defendants was in a love triangle with Bernard Madoff himself," prosecutors said. In the filing, the office of Preet Bharara, the U.S. attorney for Manhattan, said prosecutors had gathered "inflammatory" evidence of romantic and sexual relationships between employees and customers, including between defendants and witnesses in the upcoming trial. If the judge finds evidence of past relationships are admissible, defendants and witnesses should be prepared for details to be elicited during the government's case, the motion said. A former lawyer for Madoff declined to comment. Eric Breslin, a lawyer for former investment advisory employee Joann Crupi, said he didn't know which defendant was in the purported "love triangle." "It's just kind of strange," Breslin said of the filing. Besides Crupi, the defendants include former operations manager Daniel Bonventre, former investment advisory employee Annette Bongiorno, and former computer programmers Jerome O'Hara and George Perez. Lawyers for the other defendants either did not respond to requests for comment or declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Bharara did not immediately respond to a request for comment. At a hearing on Friday, Judge Laura Taylor Swain denied a request by lawyers for the five former employees to delay the trial for two months because of a new indictment filed by prosecutors last week.  The case is USA v. O'Hara et al, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 10-0228.(Reporting by Nate Raymond; Editing by Kenneth Barry)
REUTERS/Brendan McDermidHistorically, dividends have been critical for maximizing total returns. But what are driving stock prices to all-time highs today? From Guggenheim Partners' Scott Minerd: Multiple Expansion Driving the Rally in U.S. EquitiesThe P/E multiple, defined as the ratio of price to trailing 12-month earnings, has been the main driver of the rally in U.S. equities over the past two years. The S&amp;P 500 index has increased by over 34 percent since the beginning of 2011, of which 28 percent has come from multiple expansion. During the same period, growth in corporate earnings has slowed. The trailing 12-month earnings for S&amp;P 500 companies rose 2.4 percent in 2012 and another 2.5 percent for the first seven months of this year, registering the slowest earnings growth in non-recession years since 1998. Without renewed earnings growth, a continued rally in stocks driven by multiple expansion may be not sustainable. When multiples are expanding, stocks are getting "more expensive." Guggenheim Partners
So let's get right to this week's look at the high frequency weekly indicators. This is probably a good week to remind readers that the purpose of looking at these numbers is that they are as close to an up-to-the minute look at the economy as we can get. They can be noisy, but if there is an important turn in the economy, it will show up here before it shows up in the monthly numbers. For example, two years ago the Gallup Daily Consumer Spending report showed that consumers were continuing to spend during the debt ceiling debacle, despite the monthly numbers hitting an air pocket. The conclusion and the title are the last things I write, after I've recorded the numbers. And the post is designed so that the conclusion is after the numbers, so you can form your own opinion freely. Anyway, let's start this week with consumer spending, because Gallup consumer spending turns out to be the star of the show again. Consumer spending Gallup's 14 day average of consumer spending went over $100 this week for the first time since the financial crisis of September 2008, almost 5 years ago. At least as consumers are reporting it, back to school shopping is on a tear. The ICSC varied between +1.5% and +4.5% YoY in 2012, while Johnson Redbook was generally below +3%. The ICSC had a good week this week as well, and Johnson Redbook remains close to the high end of its range. Oil prices and usage The price of Oil remained near its 52 week high. The 4 week average for gas usage was, for the fifth week in a row after a long streak to the contrary, up YoY. Interest rates and credit spreads Interest rates for corporate bonds had been falling since being just above 6% in January 2011, hitting a low of 4.46% in November 2012. Treasuries previously were at a 2.4% high in late 2011, falling to a low of 1.47% in July 2012, but remain back above that high. Spreads remained at their new 52 week low this week. Their recent high was over 3.4% in June 2011. Housing metrics  Mortgage applications from the Mortgage Bankers Association: Refinancing applications have decreased sharply in the last 11 weeks due to higher interest rates to a two year low. Purchase applications have also declined from their multiyear highs in April. Both purchases and refinance applications stabilized this week. Housing prices Housing prices bottomed at the end of November 2011 on Housing Tracker, and averaged an increase of +2.0% to +2.5% YoY during 2012. This week's YoY increase is still close to a 7 year record. Real estate loans, from the FRB H8 report: Loans turned up at the end of 2011 and averaged about 1% gains YoY through most of 2012. Â Over the last few months, the comparisons have completely stalled. Money supply M1 M2 Real M1 made a YoY high of about 20% in January 2012 and eased off thereafter. Earlier this year it increased again but has backed off its highs significantly. Â Real M2 also made a YoY high of about 10.5% in January 2012. Â Its subsequent low was 4.5% in August 2012. It increased slightly in the first few months of this year and has generally stabilized since, although it has declined slightly in the past few weeks. Employment metrics The American Staffing Association Index rose 1 to 96. It is up +3.2% YoY Initial jobless claims Tax Withholding Daily tax withholding has improved to the middle part of its YoY range compared with its YoY average comparison in the last 7 months. Initial claims remain within their recent range of between 325,000 to 375,000, and have flattened out just as they have in the last 3 springs and summers. The 4 week moving average, however, made a new post-recession low this week. Transport Railroad transport from the AAR Shipping transport Rail transport has been both positive and negative YoY in the last several months. This week it was positive once again.Â The Harpex index had been improving slowly from its January 1 low of 352, but has flattened out in the last 8 weeks. The Baltic Dry Index has retreated from its recent 52 week high. In the larger picture, both the Baltic Dry Index and the Harpex declined sharply since the onset of the recession, and have been in a range near their bottom for about 2 years, but have stopped falling. Bank lending rates The TED spread is still near the low end of its 3 year range, and has fallen back from its slight rise in the last month. Â LIBOR established yet another new 3 year low. JoC ECRI Commodity prices The one and only negative this week was the increase in interest rates. For the week, mortgage applications and gas prices joined shipping rates as neutral. Everything else was positive. Rail had a positive week, oil and gas prices were slightly lower, gas usage was higher, interest rate spreads remained at a 1 year plus low, house prices were very positive, bank rates were very positive, money supply remained positive, the 4 week average of initial jobless claims made a new post-recession low, temporary jobs have turned positive again, and most of all, consumer spending was strong, especially as measured by Gallup. The American consumer is truly a wonder to behold. Have a nice weekend.
I wouldn’t want to get overly carried away or be dismissive of the remaining cyclical and structural challenges out there, but recent data have definitely taken a turn for the better in the UK and euro area and, of course, it has been that way in Japan and the US for a while now. Before I turn to the evidence, let me state for the avoidance of doubt the obvious challenges that remain. The euro area’s structural problems could burst open at any moment, particularly after the German elections in the autumn, and we have to remain braced for that. After the elections there are likely to be more frank discussions on a number of significant underlying issues, such as a banking union, eurobonds and, of course, the seemingly neverending austerity in a number of Mediterranean countries. In Japan, the improved mood could be undone through either an early push to raise consumption taxes significantly or, indeed, the absence of any plan to deal with their huge fiscal debts, as well as a sudden abrupt recovery of the yen. In the US, underlying fiscal challenges remain. The challenge posed by a lessening of the Federal Reserve’s quantitative easing through an early tapering – never mind the day when the Fed starts raising interest rates – will be significant. Geopolitical uncertainties persist, especially in the Middle East, and, related partially to this, fears of a fresh surge in oil and other commodity prices are other obvious things that could go wrong. All of these things could derail signs of recovery here and elsewhere – and, in our case, we have debt and rebalancing challenges to deal with. But these risks haven’t prevented some more recent signals getting brighter. When the provisional 0.6pc quarter-on-quarter real GDP rise for Q2 was announced, some observers thought this was partially distorted and things would slow in Q3. But it was the second consecutive quarterly rise, something that, since 2008, has become rare. But the July indicators include some very robust signals, especially all the monthly purchasing managers’ indices (PMI indicators). Each of the three, for construction, manufacturing and services, showed very strong performances, with the services index rising to 60.2, the highest since November 2006. If the July momentum of these three indicators were representative of underlying trends in the economy, then this would suggest an acceleration – possibly significantly – beyond Q2’s 0.6pc rate and suggest that something has finally changed for the better out there. As I said, it is premature to get too carried away, but these are certainly encouraging signals. To add to this flavour, the US July manufacturing ISM – their equivalent to the PMI – rose much more than expected to 55.4. Their services ISM also rose more than expected and, in a particular piece of good news, the latest trade balance declined to $34.2bn (£22bn), a number that suggests the US can grow decently without sucking in so many imports compared with exports. This suggests the US is adjusting its economy as well as growing. Just as encouragingly, the eurozone PMI returned to positive territory, jumping to 50.3, with evidence of more countries than just Germany experiencing this improvement. The euro area’s services PMI was not as robust but it also showed a further decent rise and contributed to the so-called Composite PMI – an aggregate of the manufacturing and services indices – jumping to 50.5, the best in the euro area for 24 months. What can be behind this reasonably sudden Western recovery, especially as the breadth of the countries showing the signals is wider than we have seen since the 2008-09 collapse? I can think of three things. First, some of it might just be plain old “animal spirits” as consumers and companies stop postponing decisions that at some point in the future they would have to make. That would only really make sense if it were linked to some other factors. A second one might be the easing of many commodity prices over the past few months, especially for food and energy, which at the margin might have made both consumers and commodity price-sensitive producers feel a bit better off. A third factor – though less easy to observe – could relate to changing relative competitiveness between the developed and emerging world. Rapidly rising wages in the likes of China and elsewhere might be helping the net trade position of a number of countries. Not only would this help boost exports but it might also lead a number of companies wanting to produce more at home than overseas; this might happen slowly but will possibly be a more lasting factor. Some weeks ago, I raised the possibility that more challenging conditions in the emerging world might actually have some positives for us by lessening upward pressures on many commodity prices as well as improving competitiveness, and this is indeed looking important. Not that we should be writing off the larger emerging economies, especially China. As I argued a fortnight ago, if they grow by 7.5pc instead of 10pc, or perhaps even a bit less, it will be even better for us – so long as their consumer spending stays strong or strengthens further. In this light, China’s own monthly PMI indicators also showed a slight improvement in July in both manufacturing and services. Another factor might start to help more, and certainly reduce one of those risks of things going wrong again, or at least too early. In a number of countries, a new fashion has burst out among central bankers, namely “forward guidance”, which is simply a fancy term to explain that central bankers won’t start raising interest rates until certain conditions have been met – in many cases, unemployment falling quite a bit further. Here in Britain, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney led his colleagues into their own version of forward guidance this week, suggesting current policies will stay in place until unemployment drops below 7pc, something they think is probably not going to happen until 2016. So, as many of us enjoy our annual summer holidays, people may be feeling brighter than for a while. Let’s hope it stays that way into the autumn.
