Just under an hour ago, The Bank of Japan announced it would adopt a 2 percent inflation target.Â  It also announced it would pursue open-ended asset purchases starting in January 2014. While all of this is pretty aggressive, it appears that it was largely priced into the markets. The Japanese yen sunk after the announcement, but has since come back and is now up against the dollar. Here's an intraday chart of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen via Bloomberg. Bloomberg
OiMax / FlickrBank of JapanThe Bank of Japan's monetary policy decision is out. First, the Bank of Japan said it will adopt a 2 percent inflation target, which was widely expected. Second, the BoJ announced an aggressive open-ended asset purchase plan, which will begin in January 2014.Â  It'll purchase 2 trillion yen worth of JGBs per month and 10 trillion yen worth of T-bills per month.Â  This is according to Bloomberg Television. This aggressive policy was the platform on which Shinzo Abe was re-elected to his post as Prime Minister. Expectations for a weak yen, inflationary policy has traders around the world shorting the yen while, going long Japanese stocks.

APAn estimated 800,000 people descended on Capitol Hill Monday to celebrate the start of President Barack Obama's second term with a day of political pageantry.  From Bill Clinton's Kelly Clarkson photo bomb to Joe Biden's triumphant walk down the National Mall parade route, we've compiled our favorite images from the day's festivities.
First Lady Michelle Obama debuted a gorgeous red gown by designer Jason Wu Monday night as she joined her husband onstage for their first inauguration dance at the Commander-in-Chief Ball.Â  The ruby-colored chiffon and velvet dress was custom-made by Wu, who also designed the First Lady's dress for Obama's first Inaugural Ball. According to a White House official, Michelle Obama is also wearing a handmade diamond-embellished ring by jewelry designer Kimberly McDonald and Jimmy Choo shoes.Â  Here's a close-up of the dress:Â  AP And here's a photo of the First Couple's first dance â€” and the dress. This year, the Obamas danced their first dance to Al Green's "Let's Stay Together," performed by Jennifer Hudson. Â  AP When the inauguration is over, the dress will go into the National Archives. The First Lady's 2009 Inauguration dress was donated to the Smithsonian in 2010. Â Â  Here's a picture of that dress:Â  AP UPDATE: Michelle Obama was also wearing bangles by Kimberly MacDonald for ForeverMark Diamonds.
Wikimedia CommonsSometime in the next couple of hours, the Bank of Japan is expected to to announce its next rate decision. This meeting, and the expectations of a an aggressive move, have been anticipated by traders (particularly currency traders) for a long time. The expectation is that it will increase its inflation outlook to 2.0%, bringing it more in line with the goals of the new PM. Anything else would be quite a shock. In the meantime, the yen is a little bit stronger, as is the Nikkei. We'll have the full decision.
APObama used his second Inaugural Address today to spell out his big ideas for his second term. He hit on some big liberal ideas: Gay rights, gun control, climate change, and immigration. The real bombshell was what he didn't include, however. He could have included a serious paragraph about a "Grand Bargain" to reduce the deficit. It would have been seen as a ballast to anchor the liberalism, and an olive branch to the GOP. Instead, he only addressed it in a half-hearted manner. In fact, he almost mocked the idea of deficit reduction. Philip Klein at the Washington Examiner observed He declared that, “We must make the hard choices to reduce the cost of health care and the size of our deficit.” This is Barack Obama, bold leader speaking (with an extra twist of irony given that the signature legislative accomplishment of his first term was supposedly aimed at containing the growth of health care costs). Then, he said, “But we reject the belief that America must choose between caring for the generation that built this country and investing in the generation that will build its future.” Translation: he isn’t going to do anything to seriously reform Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid, and wants more economic stimulus spending, too. So, within a breath of calling for hard choices, he rejected the need for them... Prior to today, there had been some talk that Obama would pursue deficit reduction, as part of his legacy project in his second term. But it's pretty clear that ship has sailed. During the debt ceiling fight and the fiscal cliff fight, Obama was (widely reportedly) willing to make cuts to entitlements in exchange for higher taxes from Republicans. They never found that deal. It's still possible that something big could come out of the upcoming sequestration/budget battle, but most likely, Obama is done on the entitlement, spending front. And realistically, this may be the end of serious entitlement talk for a long while. Entitlement cutting had appeal with gigantic, trillion dollar deficits (even though entitlements were not driving said deficits). But as the deficit shrinks, the broader appetite for addressing any of these issues will fade. Beyond that, Obama was the natural President to make changes to these programs, in a Nixon-to-China sort of way. The opportunity might not come again.

In short, “every week a new book title announces an “irresistible” tilt east, the emergence of “Chimerica” and a not-too-distant future when China “rules” the planet.”  China’s winning.  America’s a distant second. Now, here’s the thing: it’s time to hold up on the “America’s declining/China’s taking over the world” rant. After all, remember Japan?  The country Americans once observed with panicked fascination now sits on the world’s periphery, suffering from a deflationary hangover while struggling with how to deal with a nearly unsolvable demographics issue several decades in the making. So, in short, while China is certainly a political, economic, and financial force to be reckoned with, the United States isn’t quite ready to secure its place on the silver podium. Here, then, are the 5 key issues ailing China: 1) Rotten to the core: Often lost in the China-as-Superpower debate is a thorough examination of the corruption that rots both the political and economic systems of the rising nation.  To whit: in the past five years alone, more than 660,000 government officials have been investigated for corruption of some sort, highlighting “many serious cases which involved phenomenal sums of money and officials at or above the ministerial level.”  Furthermore, for a foreign enterprise to do business within the country, one in which “bribery is rampant,” means running the significant and expensive risk of intellectual property theft.  In short, it’s more expensive to do business in China than most think – a factor that will inevitably cut into the country’s ascension in the 21st century. 2) China’s non-growth story: One word defines China’s 21st century growth: infrastructure.  Now, obviously, China’s exponential economic growth has come from more than just internal spending (sales to developing regions such as Latin America and Africa (as well as Asia) – while trailing behind those of the United States – have obviously driven China’s development), but Chinese officials have expertly utilized (if not over-depended upon) internal infrastructure projects to maintain the country’s economic momentum.  In fact, “fixed asset investment - a key indicator on infrastructure spending - was up 20.6% in 2012. A staggering £3.63trn was spent on infrastructure projects through 2012,” as “China accelerated administrative approvals for infrastructure investment, notably for building subways, in the middle of last year, in a bid to boost economic growth.”  In short, “infrastructure spending will continue to be a key factor in China's economic performance this year,” compiling nearly 70% of the country’s GDP (a number nearly twice as high as 1980’s Japan (35%) and the United States (20%)). Take away this internal spending, and China’s growth numbers slow dramatically. Which leads us to… 3) The lending nightmare that is China: This infrastructure spending binge has and will continue to come at a heavy price for China: “Financed through heavy borrowing by local governments and clever accounting that masks the true size of the debt,” these infrastructure projects mean “China’s municipal governments could already be sitting on huge mountains of hidden debt — a lurking liability that threatens to stunt the nation’s economic growth for years or even decades to come.”  In fact, after China’s national government instituted a $586 billion stimulus program in 2008 to stem the effects of the global financial crisis, China’s cities gorged on infrastructure projects to boost productivity and growth.  Now, nearly 5 years later, while the total debt load numbers remain opaque, experts predict them to total between 25-250% of percent of the country's GDP, which signifies that “loads of bad debt could also result in inflation, a prolonged economic slump, or even a financial meltdown.” Furthermore, as China’s banking system has evolved, essentially, into an unmitigated disaster, there have emerged significant concerns about the country’s financial system, including those involving “wealth management products offered by “trust companies,” part of the shadow banking system that operates outside the official banking sector but is entwined with it.” 4) Demographics: It’s no secret to the informed that China has a massive demographics issue that will, one day soon, cut significantly into the country’s economic horizons.   The nation’s single-child policy has created a self-fulfilling low fertility loop, with “children of one-child families wanting only one child themselves,” meaning “China now probably faces a long period of ultra-low fertility.”  This reality has created a demographic duality: while “America's population is set to rise by 30% in the next 40 years,” China will hit its population peak in 2026, decreasing sharply after that.  Most importantly, China is aging at an unprecedented pace in modern history: by 2050, experts predict the average age in China will hit 49, nearly a decade older than in the United States.  This means that, because the country is growing older at a quicker pace than it is wealthier, “China will have a bulge of pensioners before it has developed the means of looking after them.”  Currently, China’s unfunded pension liability totals roughly 150% of the country’s GDP, with local governments already reneging on pension obligations. Finally, between 2013 and 2050, China's workforce is set to shrink as share of the “population by 11 percentage points, from 72% to 61%—a huge contraction, even allowing for the fact that the workforce share is exceptionally large now,” meaning the end of China as the world’s source for cheap labor.  Most interestingly, experts predict that within the next 20 years, China will begin “importing workers from outside, rather than exporting them,” slowing growth in an already stressed economy. 5) America knows how to fail better than the Chinese: To the uninitiated, this point may not make sense, but think about it: despite 2008’s rescue attempt of the American financial system (aka, the TARP debacle), the United States has, historically, been capable of absorbing the economic and financial pains of industry collapse while adapting and moving forward.  Think of the steel industry: having reached its apogee between 1940-1970, the steel industry quickly (and, it must be stated, painfully) declined, contracting down to the point that by 2001, it accounted for less than .1% of manufacturing employment and output. As a state-controlled economy, China possesses no such will or mandate to allow this sort of economic and financial evolution without running the risk of revolution from an expectant (and unstable) population.  This leaves an ugly core of corruption and control pushing to sustain increasingly low-margin industries in a country growing beyond its Communist means. So there we go.  Is China poised to continue to be a world power?  Yes. Of course.  But the next United States? Not so fast.  After all, no one manufactures, evolves, and, of course, fails as quickly and effectively as we do.

This point came across vividly in a video recently released by the usually level-headed David McAlvaney titled "The Fuse Is Lit Part 3 - an American Reckoning." In it, the smooth and articulate McAlvaney is shown behind the wheel of his SUV tooling across the picturesque small town in Colorado where he lives inveighing against the public that elects politicians who deliver the voters cash benefits. This dynamic is surely deadly, and implies Democracy's tragic self-limiting nature. But McAlvaney suggests if we could come to grips with the fiscal quandary of "entitlement" spending, American life would just rock on.       This is plainly not so, but it also reveals the tragic shortsightedness of even thoughtful conservatives - and there are some out there, indeed we need them, indeed one of the political tragedies of recent American history is the surrender of conservatism to religious hysterics, professional ignoramuses, military chauvinists, and flat-earthers. A true conservative would recognize the land development pattern of the millennial USA as a consequence of tragic collective choices, a living arrangement with no future, a trap every bit as lethal as Medicare and social security.      The catch is, we're not going to unbuild suburbia and all its accessories. There's no way to legislate it away. We're stuck with it. The suburban entitlement will fail even more dramatically than the social entitlements that conservatives grouse about because there's no way to "print" cheap oil or well-paid livelihoods the way you can monetize public debt to support social spending. You can "print" mortgages, of course, for people with little chance of paying them down, but that only leads to the financial hostage racket called too-big-to-fail banking, and we know where that's gotten us.      Around the Internet, in the vale of financial podcasting, you can hear voices cheerleading the "return" of the house-building industry. Is it a good thing that real estate speculators are banging up yet more housing subdivisions in the hills around San Diego? I can tell you why they are doing it: because that is the only way they know how to build anything in California. They're stuck in the habits and practices of the 20th century, building more car dependent stuff for a society that is already dying a slow death from living that way.      In the collapse of all these rackets, bad habits, and brain-dead behaviors that it sure to come, historians will have a hard time sorting out what exactly brought down the empire. The big element that will not be so visible is the poverty of imagination that set the tone for it - especially among public figures and spokespeople who should have seen and articulated these relationships, and extra-especially among self-proclaimed conservatives.      This happens to be the day when the articulator-in-chief gets his official new lease in office. Genial figure that he is, I don't think President Obama has a clue where all this is heading. I suppose he'll argue for stricter gun laws today, but that horse is already so far out of the barn it's in the next county. We don't seem to realize that America is now fully armed. Additional firearms are just superfluous at this point. And to some degree the people armed themselves in direct consequence as their government tinkered with due process, and sent drone aircraft into the American skies, and commenced computer hacking operations over every business transaction in the system, and voided the rule-of-law against criminal uber-bankers who creamed off the nation's wealth while holding the economy hostage. Since the armed public is not ready to mount an insurrection against this impudence, the dangerous tension is expressed in morbid and tragic episodes of mass shootings by maniacs against the innocent. What I want to know: where is the lone swindled rancher who waits to bushwhack Jon Corzine of MF Global in the parking lots of Easthampton, since the law won't touch him?      I suppose we'll hear about immigration reform today. It will surely be some cockamamie proposal to legitimize the "undocumented" by shanghaiing them into the military (think: mercenaries), and otherwise keeping the welcome mat down for more newcomers waiting politely at the front door. This is insane, of course. The USA needs to reduce its population consistent with the tremendous economic contraction underway world-wide. There are too many people for the world to support and shifting them into this country from regions more rapidly affected by contraction is just dumb -- but we have our cultural myths to defend... and voting blocs to appease.      It seems obvious to me that in the, say, four years ahead (one presidential term), we will not come to grips with any of the forces of reality bearing down on us. We will lose control of the money system; we'll go broke trying to keep up our oil supplies; the American public will get more economically desperate and angry; and pretty soon the practical matters of daily life will become rather harsh. And at that point faith in the system finally evaporates and people fight over the table scraps of a failed polity.      Many of us around the country are hoping for a better outcome in the successful downscaling and re-localizing of American life, but those questions are just not in the arena. Hence, the arena itself will probably have to topple and crash before life is reorganized outside of where it used to stand.____________________________________For a complete list of books by James Howard Kunstler and purchase links, CLICK HERE.          Read more posts on Kunstler.com »
Al Roker looks like he's having the time of his life at the Inauguration Day parade in Washington.Â  First, the NBC weatherman managed to score the first post-inauguration "interview" with President Barack Obama, after shouting him down along the parade route. "I think we can pretty much assume that it's going to be a failure," Roker said, before hollering: "MR. PRESIDENT! MR. PRESIDENT! MR. PRESIDENT! HOW'S IT GOING!" To everyone's amazement, Obama actually responded: "It's going great!" he said with a thumbs up. "IS THE WEATHER GOOD?" Roker yelled back. "It's great!" Obama replied.Â  Here's the video, courtesy of NBC:Â   Visit NBCNews.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy Â  Roker had even better luck with Vice President Joe Biden a few minutes later. The exchange â€” and Roker's mic drop â€” are pretty priceless.Â 
The Roots of Strength Microsoft Microsoft was for a time the primary corporate beneficiary of the PC revolution.Â  The insight of co-founder Bill Gates that maximum profit could be generated from sale of the software that ran computers, rather than from sale of the computers themselves, was a simple but profound idea that led to a gusher of profitability that continues to this day. Using its strength in operating systems, first with MS DOS and then with Windows, Microsoft successfully pushed its way into productivity software, leading to the Office suite of products, as well as more high-end enterprise tools such as the Exchange, SQL Server, Sharepoint and Great Plains products. Today the company boosts imposing financial health.Â  Revenue and cash flow came in at $73.7 billion and $31.6 billion for FY12.Â  Additionally, management has demonstrated a focus on returning cash to shareholders, with $10.7 billion returned in FY12 through stock buybacks and dividends. Google Google came of age at a fundamentally different time and in a different competitive landscape.Â  Whereas Microsoftâ€™s management intuited where profitability would concentrate in the PC ecosystem and positioned themselves to reap maximum gains, Google entered a crowded market (search) that few thought was in need of improving and revolutionized it with a superior product. Google has demonstrated considerable earning power, with LTM revenue of $47.5 billion and operating cash flow of $15.9 billion.Â  Nonetheless, the company is considerably less diversified than Microsoft, with 77% of Q3 revenue coming from Google.com and Googleâ€™s network partners.Â  Different Paths Understanding the fundamental differences between Microsoft and Google comes down to the different paths each company took to dominance.Â  Microsoft is a company that determined where best to place the mousetrap, and improved its products over time after securing advantageous placement.Â  Google is a company that built a better mousetrap, and over time learned how to make placement irrelevant.Â  Microsoft utilized Mooreâ€™s Law to sell software with ever more bells and whistles, Google utilized Mooreâ€™s Law to sell advertising and give away software as a loss-leader.Â  Pressure on Multiple Fronts Both companies are pressing, and being pressed, on multiple fronts.Â  Conclusion The free cash flow problem has perhaps never been better illustrated than it is with these two companies.Â  Both sit on massive cash piles ($66.1 billion and $44.6 billion for Microsoft and Google, respectively), but the market niches they dominated to generate that cash hoard are undergoing rapid change.Â  Whether it is within the power of the management of either company to more aggressively return cash to shareholders remains an open question.Â  With the pressures these two have the ability to place on one another, the prospect for value destruction in the near-term appears considerable.

House Majority Leader Eric Cantor was not impressed by inaugural poet Richard Blanco's reading during President Barack Obama's inauguration ceremony Monday.  Here's a picture of Cantor's reaction, courtesy of 30FPS:  Courtesy of 30FPS  Here's the full text of the poem, in case you were curious what made Cantor so perplexed:  One Today One sun rose on us today, kindled over our shores,peeking over the Smokies, greeting the facesof the Great Lakes, spreading a simple truthacross the Great Plains, then charging across the Rockies.One light, waking up rooftops, under each one, a storytold by our silent gestures moving behind windows. My face, your face, millions of faces in morning’s mirrors,each one yawning to life, crescendoing into our day:pencil-yellow school buses, the rhythm of traffic lights,fruit stands: apples, limes, and oranges arrayed like rainbowsbegging our praise. Silver trucks heavy with oil or paper—bricks or milk, teeming over highways alongside us,on our way to clean tables, read ledgers, or save lives—to teach geometry, or ring-up groceries as my mother didfor twenty years, so I could write this poem. All of us as vital as the one light we move through,the same light on blackboards with lessons for the day:equations to solve, history to question, or atoms imagined,the “I have a dream” we keep dreaming,or the impossible vocabulary of sorrow that won’t explainthe empty desks of twenty children marked absenttoday, and forever. Many prayers, but one lightbreathing color into stained glass windows,life into the faces of bronze statues, warmthonto the steps of our museums and park benches as mothers watch children slide into the day. One ground. Our ground, rooting us to every stalkof corn, every head of wheat sown by sweatand hands, hands gleaning coal or planting windmillsin deserts and hilltops that keep us warm, handsdigging trenches, routing pipes and cables, handsas worn as my father’s cutting sugarcaneso my brother and I could have books and shoes. The dust of farms and deserts, cities and plainsmingled by one wind—our breath. Breathe. Hear itthrough the day’s gorgeous din of honking cabs,buses launching down avenues, the symphonyof footsteps, guitars, and screeching subways,the unexpected song bird on your clothes line. Hear: squeaky playground swings, trains whistling,or whispers across café tables, Hear: the doors we openfor each other all day, saying: hello, shalom,buon giorno, howdy, namaste, or buenos díasin the language my mother taught me—in every languagespoken into one wind carrying our liveswithout prejudice, as these words break from my lips. One sky: since the Appalachians and Sierras claimedtheir majesty, and the Mississippi and Colorado workedtheir way to the sea. Thank the work of our hands:weaving steel into bridges, finishing one more reportfor the boss on time, stitching another wound or uniform, the first brush stroke on a portrait,or the last floor on the Freedom Towerjutting into a sky that yields to our resilience. One sky, toward which we sometimes lift our eyestired from work: some days guessing at the weatherof our lives, some days giving thanks for a lovethat loves you back, sometimes praising a motherwho knew how to give, or forgiving a fatherwho couldn’t give what you wanted. We head home: through the gloss of rain or weightof snow, or the plum blush of dusk, but always—home,always under one sky, our sky. And always one moonlike a silent drum tapping on every rooftopand every window, of one country—all of us—facing the starshope—a new constellationwaiting for us to map it,waiting for us to name it—together
The economic performance of American presidents tends to deteriorate during their second term THE economic auguries for Barack Obama’s second term are not good. By comparing the changes across eight economic indicators (GDP, industrial production, household incomes, house prices, unemployment, consumer confidence, stockmarkets and federal debt) during their presidential terms, The Economist has analysed the economic performance of all 11 two-term presidents since Teddy Roosevelt took office in September 1901. The first chart below shows that the average change in each of these economic indicators. With the exception of federal debt, which rises at a slower rate than in the first term, on average, all these indicators deteriorate. The economic performance of the 11 two-term presidents worsens by some 4.2 percentage points on average in their second terms compared with their first.

Atlantic WireSupreme Court Associate Justice Antonin Scalia is wearing a strange hat.Â  After some analysis, it's probably a Tudor bonnet.Â  This is the second consecutive Inauguration where Scalia is wearing an odd headpiece. Last time, Senator Claire McCaskill (D-MO) tweeted about the justice's "weird Hat." The particular genus of that hat has remained unidentified for four years.Â  WikipediaTudor bonnets are traditional academic dress for a person who holds a professional doctoral degree. It's made of velvet or cloth.Â  It's unclear whether Scalia's hat is in fact a Tudor bonnet, but it bears a distinct resemblance. It also coincides with Scalia's J.D. from Harvard Law School. Any haberdashers with additional insight on the headgear are encouraged to respond with additional information.Â  Â  UPDATE: A reader has sent along this articleÂ which identifies Justice Antonin Scalia's head gear definitively.Â Â According to Kevin Walsh, a professor at the University of Richmond School Of Law: The hat is a custom-made replica of the hat depicted inÂ Holbeinâ€™s famous portrait of St. Thomas More. It was a gift from the St. Thomas More Society of Richmond, Virginia. We presented it to him in November 2010 as a memento of his participation in our 27th annual Red Mass and dinner More lived during the Tudor dynasty so it is likely that the hat is of the Tudor Bonnet variety.Â 
Beyonce Knowles just wowed the nation with her rendition of The National Anthem at Obama's Inauguration. It was just amazing. Her singing of the word "proof" right before the 2 min mark shows why her vocal capabilities are so extraordinary. 
APObama just wrapped up his inauguration speech. The #1 reaction? It was liberal. He hit on climate change, saving entitlements, and gay rights in solid ways. There was no faux centrism. For example, on climate change he said: We, the people, still believe that our obligations as Americans are not just to ourselves, but to all posterity. We will respond to the threat of climate change, knowing that the failure to do so would betray our children and future generations. Some may still deny the overwhelming judgment of science, but none can avoid the devastating impact of raging fires, and crippling drought, and more powerful storms. The path towards sustainable energy sources will be long and sometimes difficult. But America cannot resist this transition; we must lead it. We cannot cede to other nations the technology that will power new jobs and new industries – we must claim its promise. That is how we will maintain our economic vitality and our national treasure – our forests and waterways; our croplands and snowcapped peaks. That is how we will preserve our planet, commanded to our care by God. That’s what will lend meaning to the creed our fathers once declared. And on gay rights, he wrote: It is now our generation’s task to carry on what those pioneers began. For our journey is not complete until our wives, our mothers, and daughters can earn a living equal to their efforts. Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law – for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well. Our journey is not complete until no citizen is forced to wait for hours to exercise the right to vote. Our journey is not complete until we find a better way to welcome the striving, hopeful immigrants who still see America as a land of opportunity; until bright young students and engineers are enlisted in our workforce rather than expelled from our country. Our journey is not complete until all our children, from the streets of Detroit to the hills of Appalachia to the quiet lanes of Newtown, know that they are cared for, and cherished, and always safe from harm.  And he even took a shot at the GOP: We cannot mistake absolutism for principle... The reaction: He won the election, and he can finally give a liberal speech. This is a suprisingly liberal speech. This is a speech a president gives when he knows he doesn't need to worry about getting re-elected. Obama not shying away from a liberal agenda: gay rights, immigration, Newtown (guns), collective action, entitlements. "We must act." I believe this is the most 'progressive' speech Obama has ever given For the full tet of the speech, see here.
David N. Walker Photography via Flickr Environmentalists will be happy with this paragraph in Obama's speech: We, the people, still believe that our obligations as Americans are not just to ourselves, but to all posterity. We will respond to the threat of climate change, knowing that the failure to do so would betray our children and future generations. Some may still deny the overwhelming judgment of science, but none can avoid the devastating impact of raging fires, and crippling drought, and more powerful storms. The path towards sustainable energy sources will be long and sometimes difficult. But America cannot resist this transition; we must lead it. We cannot cede to other nations the technology that will power new jobs and new industries â€“ we must claim its promise. That is how we will maintain our economic vitality and our national treasure â€“ our forests and waterways; our croplands and snowcapped peaks. That is how we will preserve our planet, commanded to our care by God. Thatâ€™s what will lend meaning to the creed our fathers once declared.
The Economist Intelligence Unit recently published its "Where To Be Born in 2013" list, a measure of which countries provide the best opportunities for a healthy, safe and prosperous life in the years ahead. WOND, an infographics and data visualization outfit based outside London, has put together a great repackaging of the data, which also included the list from 1988. Needless to say, things have changed over the past 25 years. With their permission, we're republishing it here. (Check them out at wond.co.uk). WOND/EIU And here are the measures: 
Here's the full text of President Barack Obama's second inauguration address, courtesy of the White House: "Vice President Biden, Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the United States Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow citizens:  Each time we gather to inaugurate a president, we bear witness to the enduring strength of our Constitution.  We affirm the promise of our democracy.  We recall that what binds this nation together is not the colors of our skin or the tenets of our faith or the origins of our names.  What makes us exceptional – what makes us American – is our allegiance to an idea, articulated in a declaration made more than two centuries ago: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.” Today we continue a never-ending journey, to bridge the meaning of those words with the realities of our time.  For history tells us that while these truths may be self-evident, they have never been self-executing; that while freedom is a gift from God, it must be secured by His people here on Earth.  The patriots of 1776 did not fight to replace the tyranny of a king with the privileges of a few or the rule of a mob.  They gave to us a Republic, a government of, and by, and for the people, entrusting each generation to keep safe our founding creed.    For more than two hundred years, we have.  Through blood drawn by lash and blood drawn by sword, we learned that no union founded on the principles of liberty and equality could survive half-slave and half-free.  We made ourselves anew, and vowed to move forward together.  Together, we determined that a modern economy requires railroads and highways to speed travel and commerce; schools and colleges to train our workers. Together, we discovered that a free market only thrives when there are rules to ensure competition and fair play.  Together, we resolved that a great nation must care for the vulnerable, and protect its people from life’s worst hazards and misfortune. Through it all, we have never relinquished our skepticism of central authority, nor have we succumbed to the fiction that all society’s ills can be cured through government alone.  Our celebration of initiative and enterprise; our insistence on hard work and personal responsibility, are constants in our character. But we have always understood that when times change, so must we; that fidelity to our founding principles requires new responses to new challenges; that preserving our individual freedoms ultimately requires collective action.  For the American people can no more meet the demands of today’s world by acting alone than American soldiers could have met the forces of fascism or communism with muskets and militias.  No single person can train all the math and science teachers we’ll need to equip our children for the future, or build the roads and networks and research labs that will bring new jobs and businesses to our shores.  Now, more than ever, we must do these things together, as one nation, and one people.  This generation of Americans has been tested by crises that steeled our resolve and proved our resilience.  A decade of war is now ending.  An economic recovery has begun.  America’s possibilities are limitless, for we possess all the qualities that this world without boundaries demands:  youth and drive; diversity and openness; an endless capacity for risk and a gift for reinvention.   My fellow Americans, we are made for this moment, and we will seize it – so long as we seize it together.  For we, the people, understand that our country cannot succeed when a shrinking few do very well and a growing many barely make it.  We believe that America’s prosperity must rest upon the broad shoulders of a rising middle class.  We know that America thrives when every person can find independence and pride in their work; when the wages of honest labor liberate families from the brink of hardship.  We are true to our creed when a little girl born into the bleakest poverty knows that she has the same chance to succeed as anybody else, because she is an American, she is free, and she is equal, not just in the eyes of God but also in our own.  We understand that outworn programs are inadequate to the needs of our time.  We must harness new ideas and technology to remake our government, revamp our tax code, reform our schools, and empower our citizens with the skills they need to work harder, learn more, and reach higher.  But while the means will change, our purpose endures:  a nation that rewards the effort and determination of every single American.  That is what this moment requires.  That is what will give real meaning to our creed.    We, the people, still believe that every citizen deserves a basic measure of security and dignity.  We must make the hard choices to reduce the cost of health care and the size of our deficit.  But we reject the belief that America must choose between caring for the generation that built this country and investing in the generation that will build its future.  For we remember the lessons of our past, when twilight years were spent in poverty, and parents of a child with a disability had nowhere to turn.  We do not believe that in this country, freedom is reserved for the lucky, or happiness for the few.  We recognize that no matter how responsibly we live our lives, any one of us, at any time, may face a job loss, or a sudden illness, or a home swept away in a terrible storm. The commitments we make to each other – through Medicare, and Medicaid, and Social Security – these things do not sap our initiative; they strengthen us.  They do not make us a nation of takers; they free us to take the risks that make this country great.  We, the people, still believe that our obligations as Americans are not just to ourselves, but to all posterity.  We will respond to the threat of climate change, knowing that the failure to do so would betray our children and future generations.  Some may still deny the overwhelming judgment of science, but none can avoid the devastating impact of raging fires, and crippling drought, and more powerful storms.  The path towards sustainable energy sources will be long and sometimes difficult.  But America cannot resist this transition; we must lead it.  We cannot cede to other nations the technology that will power new jobs and new industries – we must claim its promise.  That is how we will maintain our economic vitality and our national treasure – our forests and waterways; our croplands and snowcapped peaks.  That is how we will preserve our planet, commanded to our care by God.  That’s what will lend meaning to the creed our fathers once declared. We, the people, still believe that enduring security and lasting peace do not require perpetual war.  Our brave men and women in uniform, tempered by the flames of battle, are unmatched in skill and courage.  Our citizens, seared by the memory of those we have lost, know too well the price that is paid for liberty.  The knowledge of their sacrifice will keep us forever vigilant against those who would do us harm.  But we are also heirs to those who won the peace and not just the war, who turned sworn enemies into the surest of friends, and we must carry those lessons into this time as well. We will defend our people and uphold our values through strength of arms and rule of law.  We will show the courage to try and resolve our differences with other nations peacefully – not because we are naïve about the dangers we face, but because engagement can more durably lift suspicion and fear.  America will remain the anchor of strong alliances in every corner of the globe; and we will renew those institutions that extend our capacity to manage crisis abroad, for no one has a greater stake in a peaceful world than its most powerful nation.  We will support democracy from Asia to Africa; from the Americas to the Middle East, because our interests and our conscience compel us to act on behalf of those who long for freedom.  And we must be a source of hope to the poor, the sick, the marginalized, the victims of prejudice – not out of mere charity, but because peace in our time requires the constant advance of those principles that our common creed describes:  tolerance and opportunity; human dignity and justice.  We, the people, declare today that the most evident of truths – that all of us are created equal – is the star that guides us still; just as it guided our forebears through Seneca Falls, and Selma, and Stonewall; just as it guided all those men and women, sung and unsung, who left footprints along this great Mall, to hear a preacher say that we cannot walk alone; to hear a King proclaim that our individual freedom is inextricably bound to the freedom of every soul on Earth.  It is now our generation’s task to carry on what those pioneers began.  For our journey is not complete until our wives, our mothers, and daughters can earn a living equal to their efforts.  Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law – for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well.  Our journey is not complete until no citizen is forced to wait for hours to exercise the right to vote.  Our journey is not complete until we find a better way to welcome the striving, hopeful immigrants who still see America as a land of opportunity; until bright young students and engineers are enlisted in our workforce rather than expelled from our country.  Our journey is not complete until all our children, from the streets of Detroit to the hills of Appalachia to the quiet lanes of Newtown, know that they are cared for, and cherished, and always safe from harm.  That is our generation’s task – to make these words, these rights, these values – of Life, and Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness – real for every American.  Being true to our founding documents does not require us to agree on every contour of life; it does not mean we will all define liberty in exactly the same way, or follow the same precise path to happiness.  Progress does not compel us to settle centuries-long debates about the role of government for all time – but it does require us to act in our time.    For now decisions are upon us, and we cannot afford delay.  We cannot mistake absolutism for principle, or substitute spectacle for politics, or treat name-calling as reasoned debate.  We must act, knowing that our work will be imperfect.  We must act, knowing that today’s victories will be only partial, and that it will be up to those who stand here in four years, and forty years, and four hundred years hence to advance the timeless spirit once conferred to us in a spare Philadelphia hall. My fellow Americans, the oath I have sworn before you today, like the one recited by others who serve in this Capitol, was an oath to God and country, not party or faction – and we must faithfully execute that pledge during the duration of our service.  But the words I spoke today are not so different from the oath that is taken each time a soldier signs up for duty, or an immigrant realizes her dream.  My oath is not so different from the pledge we all make to the flag that waves above and that fills our hearts with pride.  They are the words of citizens, and they represent our greatest hope.  You and I, as citizens, have the power to set this country’s course.   You and I, as citizens, have the obligation to shape the debates of our time – not only with the votes we cast, but with the voices we lift in defense of our most ancient values and enduring ideals.    Let each of us now embrace, with solemn duty and awesome joy, what is our lasting birthright.  With common effort and common purpose, with passion and dedication, let us answer the call of history, and carry into an uncertain future that precious light of freedom.    Thank you, God Bless you, and may He forever bless these United States of America.

The U.S. Government took some enormous steps and continues to take enormous steps to right the economy. In his 2013 outlook, KKR's Henry McVey points to the $7.66 trillion worth of stimulus as a reason to be bullish on real assets like real estate and commodities. From McVey: The United States is running an explicit reflationary policy of holding nominal interest rates below nominal GDP. Though this relationship was slightly more stretched back in the late 1970s, it is again near record levels. We are also dealing with far more liquidity injections by the U.S. government than in the past. In the U.S. alone, monetary and fiscal stimulus as a percentage of GDP has breached the 40% threshold, nearly 5 times what was put into the system after the great depression (Exhibit 52). Moreover, the latest round of quantitative easing is tied to unemployment, which we do not see changing quickly, given that new business formation is still running 35% below the historical average. Here's a breakdown of all that stimulus. KKR SEE ALSO: KKR's Outlook For The Stock Market And The Global Economy In 2013 &gt;
KKRVideo / YouTubePrivate equity behemoth Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. (KKR)  recently published its outlook for 2013. "[W]e are somewhat pessimistic relative to the consensus on earnings growth in early 2013," writes Henry McVey, KKR's Head of Global Macro &amp; Asset Allocation. "However, we are probably more optimistic than the consensus in our belief that the global economic cycle, the private sector in particular, is still on track and will recover as we head into 2014. Indeed, after a short, sharp pause in 1Q13, we actually see a notable re-acceleration of economic growth and profits in 2H13." Here are the five key macroviews they have for the year (Head to KKR.com for full details). Here's KKR's outlook for the world in a nutshell: KKR "[S]tocks at current levels appear compelling for longer-term investors," writes McVey. "We still expect a lot of volatility over the next few years as governments deleverage," writes McVey. "[B]ut we think the time to reduce equity exposure has largely passed. Trading multiples are now at the level where they can act as a buffer rather than the detriment they were for the decade following the year 2000." KKR's base case has the S&amp;P 500 heading to 1,550 by the end of the year.  Here's McVey: Given this view, we feel comfortable stating that – under our base case – the S&amp;P 500 appreciates about 11-12% in 2013 towards 1550 from its current level of 1400. In addition to forecasting positive earnings growth this year (which we did not in 2012), we are also using a slightly higher multiple to reflect the positive impact of heavy central bank intervention on the equity risk premium. We also think that the sustainability of the recovery, which includes strength from cyclical sectors like housing, autos, and energy, may become more obvious as we move through the second half of the year. Finally, ...the quality of earnings composition is set to rise significantly in 2013 as financials become a much smaller piece of the overall mix.

We've been seeing analysts increasingly talk about a "1994"-style situation playing out in the market. What does that mean? Basically, the market was caught off guard that year by a surprise Fed tightening, and Treasuries got hammered. Nobody expects a real "tightening" soon, but there is more talk about it, and there's a lot of talk about a "Great Rotation" from fixed income back to equity (though that might also be wishful thinking, as opposed to actual prognostication). Anyway, M&amp;G Investments on Twitter has a great few tweets about what happened to other markets in 1994. It's all well and good to talk about a jump in rates and carnage in fixed income, but if your neck of the woods is no better, then it doesn't matter. They observe. Various market commentators: "US treasury bond yields to explode higher. But don't worry, MY asset class will remain immune from this" The lesson of the 1994 bond bear market was that whilst USTs sold off, in many cases (eg Emerging Markets) risk assets sold off more... 1994 returns were: BAML US Treasury index -3.45%, MSCI EM equity index -8.67%, BAML EM Debt index -15.33% UST returns won't be so flattered in sell off this time as yields/income much lower. In 94 capital loss of over 10%, but total return -3.45% As for the S&amp;P 500, it gained 1.3% that year.

Japan's finance minister Taro Aso said Monday the elderly should be allowed to "hurry up and die" instead of costing the government money for end-of-life medical care. Aso, who also doubles as deputy prime minister, reportedly said during a meeting of the National Council on Social Security Reforms: "Heaven forbid if you are forced to live on when you want to die. You cannot sleep well when you think it's all paid by the government. "This won't be solved unless you let them hurry up and die," he said. "I don't need that kind of care. I will die quickly," he said adding he had left written instructions that his life is not artificially prolonged. During the meeting, he reportedly referred to "tube people" when talking of patients who cannot feed themselves. The 72-year-old Aso, a former prime minister, has been in his current job less than a month, but has a long history of planting his foot firmly in his mouth. In 2001 he triggered a furore by saying a successful country was one where "rich Jews" wanted to live. After Monday's mis-step, he tried to backtrack, insisting he had only been talking about his personal wishes when he said the elderly should shuffle off quickly. "I said what I personally believe, not what the end-of-life medical care system should be," he told reporters. "It is important that you can spend the final days of your life peacefully." Aso was born into a blue-blooded industrialist family but his often crude verbal slip-ups stand in marked contrast to his heritage. He is the grandson of Shigeru Yoshida, one of Japan's most influential prime ministers who helped rebuild the country from the ashes of World War II, and he is married to the daughter of another former premier. Ageing is a sensitive issue in Japan, one of the world's oldest countries, with almost a quarter of its 128 million people over 60. That figure is expected to rise to 40 percent within the next half-century. At the same time a shrinking number of workers is placing further strain on an already groaning social security system, with not enough money going into the pot to support those who depend on it.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel was forced to size up her election-year strategy Monday after a bitter defeat to the centre-left opposition in a cliffhanger state poll. In one of the tightest state races in recent memory, the Social Democrats and the Greens Sunday eked out a one-seat majority in Lower Saxony over the incumbent coalition of Merkel's Christian Democrats with the Free Democrats. After a suspense-packed night with broad implications for the September general election, the centre-left camp said it aimed to use its victory to create fresh momentum in its bid to deprive Merkel of a third four-year term. She was to meet her party and hold a news conference at 1145 GMT. "It shows the race until September is far from over," the Social Democrats' embattled challenger to Merkel, Peer Steinbrueck, said. Merkel, who campaigned hard for state premier David McAllister, a half-Scot seen as a potential successor to her, enjoys a strong lead in national polls due to her fierce defence of German interests in the eurozone crisis. But pundits said the state win could help shore up the battered campaign of the gaffe-prone Steinbrueck. The website of news weekly Der Spiegel called the result a "nightmare" for the chancellor. "It could not have been worse for Merkel and the CDU," it wrote. "The message for the national election is clear: the fight for the chancellery will be much more brutal than Merkel imagined." After a series of regional poll setbacks, Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) were the strongest party with 36 percent of the vote. Their state coalition partners for the last decade, the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP), drew nearly 10 percent -- more than doubling many pollsters' forecasts and tallying their best result in Lower Saxony in post-war history. But their cumulative result fell just short of the Social Democrats' (SPD) around 33 percent and the Greens' 14 percent, meaning the opposition can build a governing majority in Germany's fourth most populous state. The FDP, Merkel's junior partner in government since 2009, got a lift from CDU voters splitting their ballots under Germany's two-vote system in a bid to rescue the coalition. Around 101,000 voters who backed the conservatives in 2008 plumped for the FDP this time. "The black-yellow camp is not growing," Der Spiegel wrote, referring to Merkel's alliance. "It is cannibalising itself." Some 6.2 million people were called to the polls in the northwestern state home to auto giant Volkswagen. If the FDP had failed to win representation, its embattled leader Philipp Roesler, who is also Merkel's vice chancellor and economy minister and who hails from Lower Saxony, would likely have been forced to step down. The surprise outcome seemed to grant him a reprieve. "It is a great day for the FDP in Lower Saxony but it is also a great day for the FDP and liberals in Germany as a whole," a beaming Roesler told reporters. The centre-left Sueddeutsche Zeitung said the election granted both the flailing FDP and the beleaguered Social Democrats a possible new lease of life. "The FDP now has time to recover, to sort itself out," it wrote, noting it was still fighting for survival with dismal national poll ratings. "The SPD has the same task ahead." Steinbrueck, a former finance minister from Merkel's 2005-09 "grand coalition" government, has run into trouble with revelations that he made around 1.25 million euros ($1.66 million) over the last three years in speaking fees, and with comments that Merkel owed much of her popularity to her gender. Despite the narrow win, Steinbrueck admitted he had been of little help to his party in the key poll. "The Social Democrats did not have tailwinds from Berlin," he said. "I share a significant part of the responsibility." After Lower Saxony, only the southern state of Bavaria is expected to vote before the general election. Copyright (2013) AFP.

AP Photo/Kamran JebreiliSocGen has a note out asking whether 2013 will be the first year since 2000 that gold ends the year down. In it, they present the bullish and bearish argument in the simplest manner possible: There are three negative factors for gold: 1) Equities stand at their lowest level since 20 years, relative to gold, making the latter less attractive; 2) the USD could appreciate and interest rates may rise amid signs of a stronger economic recovery; 3) inflation is still under control. There are also three positive factors for gold: 1) currency wars and renewed monetary easing could push gold higher; 2) demand from emerging countries may increase; 3) in the long run, gold may play a role in the transition to an international currency reserve system. The most crucial question, really, is the interest rate one. If real interest rates in the US begin to normalize, gold will likely get crushed, as Goldman Sachs (and others) have pointed out lately. More and more people are jumping on board the "Old Normal" bandwagon, the idea that the economy is exiting its stage of crisis, and that we'll have more predictable Fed-induced business cycles. If that gains traction, bad news for gold.
As you know, it's going to be a quiet day. But in the meantime, US futures are on the rise a little bit. Barely. Here's a look at the scoreboard from Bloomberg: Bloomberg
Morgan Stanley's Daniele Antonucci has a new note on Greece titled Greece: From Shake-Up to Shape-Up? It's the first note we recall seeing in ages that wasn't an analysis of the country's sovereign debt situation, or whether it would be forced to leave the Eurozone, or whether the latest bailout would be sustainable or not. The note is about Greece's, economy, and whether the light at the end of the tunnel might be coming into visibility. The answer is: Maybe. An actual recovery isn't here yet, but Antonucci's argument is that a massive amount of uncertainty and tail risk has been removed, and that analysts under-appreciate how much the uncertainty of a Eurozone exit or default was impeding economic activity. From the note: Growth will come from the progressive attenuation and elimination of four shocks: 1. Credit crunch; 2. Fiscal austerity; 3. Structural change; 4. Euro exit worries. We believe that most investors underestimate the impact of the huge uncertainty that these shocks have exerted on economic activity and the public finances. (This was actually something I heard when I was in Greece last summer. The real economy killer was not the austerity, but rather the collapse in investment activity, that was in part the result of everyone thinking Greece was on the verge of leaving the Eurozone.) The good basically boils down to three points: Economy – recession alleviating: A recovery hasn’t started yet, but activity data are becoming less bad, as the shocks that hit the Greek economy, including euro exit worries, are starting to dissipate. Competitiveness gap closing: With unit labour costs likely to fall further, the incentive for Greece to exit the eurozone to boost competitiveness via a weaker exchange rate is no longer there. Primary surplus almost achieved: We expect Greece to reach a primary budget surplus this year and maintain it thereafter. It’s likely to be only fractional in 2013, but will gradually rise to over 3% of GDP. On the competitiveness gap, one only needs to look at this chart of unit labor cost trajectories to see Greece coming more into line with its Eurozone peers. Morgan Stanley On the economy side, there's some evidence that the industrial side of the economy is experiencing what we used to call "green shoots" Morgan Stanley Bottom line: The economy in Greece is still horrible. But with Eurozone uncertainty disappearing, the government coffers going back into primary surplus (which makes debt worries less acute), and wage competitiveness emerging, there may be hope for improvement soon.
Cool chart here from Nomura, which examines export from Asia's "Big 4" (China, Korea, Taiwan, Singapore). It shows the year-over-year change by end export destination. Nomura The real story, they note, is how fast the Rest Of Asia (Asia ex-Japan) is growing compared to the entire world. Asia Ex-Japan wasn't growing that much faster, demand-wise, than the rest of the world up until recently. Says Nomura: ..the Asian 4's exports were strongest to Asia ex-Japan itself, with the rate of growth rising from 15.0% y-o-y in November to 18.3% in December. This seems to reflect genuine Asian demand, rather than just demand for processing trade, as Chinaâ€Ÿs exports to Asia ex-Japan surged 28.9% y-o-y in December. This powerful force of intra-Asian trade gels with our view that Asian domestic demand is strengthening on very loose policies and robust capital inflows.
upload.wikimedia.orgThe world of central banking has gotten a little dull, lately, after a historic 2012. The ECB seems to be in neutral. The Fed's policy seems fairly clear cut. The center of action is Japan, where expectations of more easing (fiscal and monetary) has sent the Nikkei on a rocket ride since mid-November. The Bank of Japan has started a two day meeting, and the actual result will come sometime tomorrow. Everyone expects an increase in the inflation goal. Here's a preview from Nomura: We expect the BOJ to introduce the 2.0% inflation target desired by the government. We also expect further easing measures consistent with raising the inflation target from the previous "goal" of 1.0%. The size of the asset purchase fund could be increased (mainly JGBs), or an open-ended scheme could be introduced, scrapping the time limit and ceiling for asset purchases as the BOJ bows to government and market expectations. Prime Minister Abe has also mentioned a jobs target and a public-private fund to buy foreign bonds, but we doubt the BOJ will go that far straight away. If it does decide on bolder easing measures, we think it is more likely to increase its "rinban" JGB-buying operations. This would keep in check the level of risk assets on the BOJ's balance sheet and allow it to buy a wider range of JGBs. In that case, the BOJ's banknote rule could be temporarily frozen.
Mathematician Ian Stewart's recent book "In Pursuit of the Unknown: 17 Equations That Changed the World" takes a close look at some of the most important equations of all time. A great example of the human impact of math is the financial crisis. Black Scholes, number 17 on this list, is a derivative pricing equation that played a role.Â  "Itâ€™s actually a fairly simple equation, mathematically speaking," Professor Stewart told Business Insider. "What caused trouble was the complexity of the system the mathematics was intended to model." Numbers have power. In this case, people depended on a theoretical equation too seriously and overreached its assumptions. Without the equations on this list, we wouldn't have GPS, computers, passenger jets, or countless inventions in between.Â  You can find the book here.
Bill McBride at Calculated Risk has a great post up about the difficulty of recession forecasting. One difficulty is incentives. Many on Wall Street have a persistent incentive towards optimism. On the other hand, blog/media pundits have more of a pessimism bias, since bad news sells. McBride himself, who called the downturn and the upturn, writes: "Now one of my blogging goals is to see if I can get lucky again and call the next recession correctly." So what will cause the next recession? McBride thinks there are three likely causes: An exogenous event (like an earthquake), a major policy plunder (overly rapid austerity), or, and this is the most likely, Fed tightening. And the latter he writes: Most of the post-WWII recessions were caused by the Fed tightening monetary policy to slow inflation. I think this is the most likely cause of the next recession. Usually, when inflation starts to become a concern, the Fed tries to engineer a "soft landing", and frequently the result is a recession. Since inflation is not an immediate concern, the Fed will probably stay accommodative for a few more years.So right now I expect further growth for the next few years (all the austerity in 2013 concerns me, especially over the next couple of quarters as people adjust to higher payroll taxes, but I think we will avoid contraction). I think the most likely cause of the next recession will be Fed tightening to combat inflation sometime in the future - and residential investment (housing starts, new home sales) will probably turn down well in advance of the recession. In other words, I expect the next recession to be a more normal economic downturn - and I don't expect a recession for a few years. In just the past several days it feels the the collective commentariat (in the media and on Wall Street) have made a big shift. Folks like Mohamed El-Erian are talking about the end of the New Normal, and a return to the Old Normal, which is a huge call. SocGen has said we're about to see a "watershed" moment for the US economy. Deutsche Bank has called the end of the deleveraging. A big yoke is being lifted off the minds of investors and analysts, as they finally accept that the Great Financial Crisis era is coming to an end. And if it's true that this era is coming to an end, then that means it's time to return to more traditional analysis, and thinking about when the next normal recession will be, and what will cause it. And in the past it's been the Fed that's caused recessions, and if you think we're back in the old normal, it's a solid bet that it will be the Fed again. You can see that Fed fears are creeping back ever so slightly. Barclays said this week that by the second quarter, either the big story will be the slowdown from the tax hikes, or the beginning of serious questioning about the Fed going to the exits. This is the direction the market's mind is going in. Crisis fading. Now time to think about traditional concerns. SEE ALSO: The end of the crisis era is almost here &gt;
Jay Yarow/Business InsiderIt's going to be pretty quiet today market-wise, as the US has off for the MLK day holiday, and will be consumed with the inauguration. In the meantime, European markets are basically flat. Nothing's going on there. The big loser of the day was Japan, which fell 1.5%. A headline early in the session about Chinese ships entering disputed waters caused the yen to spike, and the Nikkei to give up early gains More importantly, a huge Bank of Japan meeting is coming up tonight, and its expected to announce new easing measures/targets. The entire world will be watching.
There was a schmoozy dinner in the Jewish Museum in Munich last night. The dinner was sponsored in part by Siemens, which I gather built part of the Mars Rover. I gather that because a replica of the Mars Rover was parked in the lobby of the museum during the dinner, with a sign suggesting that it had been made by Siemens. The Mars Rover ("Curiosity") is not as big as you might think. It's the size of a small car, but more gangly. I has a WALL-E thing going on, with a "body," "head," and "eyes." And I'm sure that's part of the point. If you want to build popular support for your Mars rovers, you've got to make them charming. Anyway, here it is. It even came with its own "Mars-like floor mat," which it was parked on.

Walking through snowy Munich last night, I saw something I've never seen before: An empty Apple store. The store was closed, so it's not surprising that it was empty.  But still, that's not something I see every day. (The flagship store in New York never closes. And it's never empty.) Henry Blodget, Business Insider Munich's a pretty city, especially at night in the snow. Here are some more shots from the center of town. The "New Town Hall" in Marienplatz. It's always a wake-up call for Americans to visit Europe and be reminded that a building started in 1867 is considered "new." Henry Blodget, Business Insider One of a couple massive iPad Mini billboards in the center of Munich: Henry Blodget, Business Insider Streetcars in the snow.  Henry Blodget, Business Insider Bikes in the snow. (In New York, those would be bike frames in the snow, with wheels, seats, handle bars, and pedals having been stolen.)
