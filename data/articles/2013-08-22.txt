From SocGen, this chart might just be everything. It shows the increase in US interest rates (orange line) vs. an index of the US dollar vs. emerging market currencies (dark blue line). With virtually perfect alignment, we're seeing rates rise in the US, and the US dollar surge against emerging markets, which have been getting crushed. There are lots of stories and potential stories embedded in this chart, including the notion that a tightening in the US could be contributing to a rise in interest rates that's sucking money away from emerging markets, and clobbering their currencies. Or the story is that the economic pendulum is swinging from the emerging world back to the US (and Europe for that matter) and that that's consistent with a rise in rates, and a strengthening of the US dollar. Either way, this is the dominant story in markets these days, and the world is watching both lines, the rise in US rates and the collapse of emerging market currencies quite closely. SocGen

Like Area 51, QE3‚Äîthe latest round of quantitative easing, as the Federal Reserve‚Äôs (Fed) bond-buying program is known‚Äîhas been surrounded by mystery (What is it actually doing? Is it working? When will it end?). Also like Area 51, the truth of how QE3 operates is less exciting than many believe. QE3 Declassified: By buying up the safest assets from bank balance sheets and bidding up prices on government bonds to make the yields on those bonds unattractive, the Fed‚Äôs QE program encourages banks and others to take on riskier assets, such as making loans or buying corporate bonds and stocks. In turn, the additional funding in the private sector stimulates investment and growth. This truth often gets lost in the conspiracy theories about a U.S. government entity buying U.S. government debt, banks pumped up with taxpayer money, or how the Fed ‚Äúmanipulates‚Äù the markets. With the next Fed meeting now less than a month away on¬†September 17-18¬†and about a 50% likelihood that they announce a tapering, or reduction, in the amount of the monthly bond-buying program at that meeting, the economic data take on a lot of importance for market participants. For example, last week was the survey week for the employment report for August that will be released on¬†September 6, putting greater-than-normal attention on this Thursday‚Äôs (August 22) initial jobless claims report that provides a glimpse into the health of the labor market last week. That means the markets may get spooked by mixed data points and volatility may remain high over the coming weeks. The pending tapering has created concerns among market participants that fear the mysterious power of the Fed has been the only thing holding the stock market up.¬†As we enter the unknown territory, or ‚ÄúArea 51‚Äù of tapering in the coming months, the reaction of the stock market should not be very mysterious: stronger economic data are good news for the stock market, ‚Äîmaybe not every day, but on balance over weeks and months‚Äîno matter if that means QE3 is ending and interest rates may head higher.¬† The last time 10-year Treasury yields were this high (above 2.8%) was right around the end of QE2, over two years ago. When both QE1 and QE2 ended, the 10-year Treasury yield fell by 1.5 percentage points (and stocks fell more than 10%) because the economy was not ready to come off of Fed support. In contrast, the fact that yields are rising as QE3 is coming to an end suggests that market participants now see economic growth as self-sustaining, and the potential for a more favorable environment for the stock market.¬† Rising bond yields accompanying economic growth have been good for the stock market in the past. There have been four periods over the past 20 years when interest rates rose for more than 12 months and by more than 1 percentage point. The S&amp;P 500 Index rose in all of those 12-month periods, including over the past year, while the bond market fell¬†[Figure 1]. This was not setting up for an eventual fall‚Äîstocks rose in the following 12 months, as well. Figure 1: Rising Interest Rates Have Been Good for Stocks Performance of S&amp;P 500 and Barclays Aggregate Bond Index During Periods Over Past 20 Years When Interest Rates Rose For More Than 12 Months and by More Than 1 Percentage Point. LPL Financial While in general, rising rates have been favorable for stocks, that has not been true for all sectors. The most interest rate sensitive sectors of the stock market, utilities and telecom, have suffered when rates rose in the past ‚Äì including during the dip we have seen so far in August with these being the worst-performing sectors of the S&amp;P 500. However, it is worth keeping in mind that they only make up about 6% of the S&amp;P 500 Index. It is the swift, sharp moves higher in yields that have caused some short-term jitters for stocks this year, but not panic.¬† We have only seen one 5% or more pullback this year and that ended with a total decline of 5.8% (which took place as the 10-year Treasury yield rose above 2% and quickly shot up to 2.6% in about a month), and the current pullback from the S&amp;P 500‚Äôs all-time high two weeks ago on August 2 has been 3.2%. This is well below the typical amount of volatility in a given year. There have been three 5% or more pullbacks in every year, on average, since WWII.¬† And the typical peak-to-trough drop each year is about 15%. We expect some volatility, but not a major downturn for stocks. For true believers, faith in the existence of UFOs and a government cover up of extraordinary and essential activities at Area 51 is unshakable. Next week‚Äôs release of the minutes of the Fed‚Äôs July 31 meeting may help to reveal some of the behind-the-scenes deliberations and cast some light on when the Fed may begin to taper.¬† The release may also help to shake the perception that the Fed‚Äôs QE3 program is something far more extraordinary than it really is.¬†

In addressing their concerns, W.J. Rossi of Florida-based Koss Olinger Financial Group thinks advisors should address this in terms of the clients' long-term goals and not around what's in the headlines. First, advisors should remind clients that the bond market is less volatile than the stock market. "The Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index, for example, had a standard deviation of returns of 3.57% over the last 15 years whereas the S&amp;P 500 had a standard deviation of 16.19%," Olinger writes in a WSJ column.¬† Second, the bond market has only had "two calendar years of negative returns." These occurred in a rising rate environment, and to address this advisors can pull "bonds with a duration or maturity lower than the benchmark you are using for your client," or hold cash for liquidity. Third advisors can help them diversify into corporate and international bonds. And finally, they shouldn't lose sight of the client's long-term goals. 29% Of Clients Keep Secrets From Their Financial Advisors (FA Mag) 29% of financial advisor clients surveyed by Securian Financial Group said they don't tell their advisors about everything that could affect their finances, reports FA Mag. 52% said the information was too personal to share. 45% said these wouldn't impact their financial strategies and 20% said the secrets were too embarrassing. The secrets were typically about health concerns, private investments or marital woes.¬†¬† "If they keep secrets, they likely have duplication in their investment portfolios, are underinsured or carry debt that eats away at their net worth,‚Äù Nicole Winter Tietel of Winter &amp; Associates told FA Mag. "Ultimately, they are taking more risk." UBS Gets Veteran Advisor From Morgan Stanley (Investment News) Former Morgan Stanley advisor John Rasweiler has joined UBS Financial Services. Rasweiler's team handles $4.8 billion in assets. John Cusate, Jack Riley, Michael Jordao, Jesse Kent and William Burke joined his team. Hedge Funds Would Be Doing Great If They Weren't Shorting Stocks (Goldman Sachs) While the S&amp;P 500 has been up 15% since the start of the year, the average equity hedge fund has been up 4.1% through August 9. In a new report, Goldman Sachs' Amanda Schneider writes that it is hedge funds' short positions that have been hurting them.¬† "Unfortunately, many widely-held short positions continue to outperform, offsetting the strong performance of popular longs and hampering overall hedge fund returns. Our basket of S&amp;P 500 stocks with the largest dollars of shorts has returned 20% YTD, in line with the S&amp;P 500. In addition, the 50 stocks over $1 billion market cap with the highest short interest as a percentage of market cap returned an average of 30%. Fully 12 of the 50 key short positions have returned more than three times the S&amp;P 500 return." Goldman Sachs Clients Want More Face-Time With Their Advisors (WealthManagement.com) Registered independent advisors (RIAs) spend 52% of their time with client-facing, while independent broker dealers (IBD) spend about 56% of their time on such activities, according to Cerulli Associates. "If you don‚Äôt handle your time with clients right, you become more reactive, and that‚Äôs dangerous to your practice," Bob Patrick or Raymond James told WealthManagement.com. "Clients want more individualized communication than ever before."
REUTERS/Brendan McDermidNASDAQ froze trading today for three hours due to a technical glitch. Trades halted due to an†issue with†something called UTP SIP quote dissemination, reminding us all that life is so fragile. We knew that the NASDAQ froze because of the faulty SIP. We knew that regulators were coordinating to figure out what went wrong. And we knew that trading eventually resumed. So what did NASDAQ have to say for itself in the new explanation? Not much. Check out their press release (via CNBC): Earlier this afternoon, NASDAQ OMX became aware that price quotes were not being disseminated by the Securities Industry Processor (SIP), which consolidates and disseminates all prices for the industry. Responding to the SIP issue, in order to protect the integrity of the markets, NASDAQ OMX issued a regulatory halt for all trading in NASDAQ-listed securities. In the first 30 minutes, technical issues with the SIP were resolved. For the remaining period of time, NASDAQ OMX, other exchanges, regulators and market participants coordinated with each other to ensure an orderly re-opening of trading in NASDAQ-listed securities. Trading resumed and the balance of the trading day finished in normal course. NASDAQ OMX will work with other exchanges that are members of the SIP to investigate the issues of today, and we will support any necessary steps to enhance the platform. The crucial question of what caused this remains unanswered.
Flickr via Fortune Live MediaTravis Kalanick, CEO and co-founder of Uber at Fortune Brainstorm 2013On-demand driver app and transportation company Uber has raised a new round of financing at a $3.5 billion valuation, according new filing. AllThingsD was first to the paperwork. TPG purchased 775,092 shares at $114.03 a piece for a ~ $90 million investment. It's not surprising a big private equity firm got in the mix; Uber was hunting for an investor capable of cutting a 9-figure check. Google Ventures also invested; AllThingsD's Kara Swisher says that's because Larry Page personally "intervened" and made sure the deal got done. Its investment may be worth $250 million. Existing investor Benchmark also purchased preferred shares for $142.54 each. Menlo Ventures, which has been a big supporter of CEO Travis Kalanick and Uber, is not listed in the filing. $3.5 billion sounds like a lofty valuation for Uber, and it's likely higher than Kalanick initially set his sights on. But here's a few reasons the mobile-powered car service is attractive to investors: It's a category leader disrupting the transportation industry to the point that it has changed laws in multiple cities and received Cease and Desists from others. In addition, Uber is¬† growing 18% month over month and it is profitable in all of its earliest cities (New York and San Francisco, to name a couple). It's reportedly generating $125 million this year. The fact that Uber has a business model that's working and can be tweaked then replicated around the world also makes it seem like a safe(r) bet.¬† Here's the filing, below via ATD: Uber Technologies

Not pictured: Jamie Dimon.You know who else sold faulty, complex interest-rate swaps to municipalities around the globe? Hitler. Not quite, says a new report concluding†Bloomberg stepped over the line when it compared JP Morgan with the Nazis in a 2011 article. In the piece, Bloomberg likened the damage done to an Italian town thanks to a bad JP Morgan deal with the town's Third Reich occupation six decades earlier. "World War IIís Battle for Cassino leveled the Italian town and its hilltop abbey," the article began "Now, the 33,000 residents are digging out from the rubble left by†Wall Street." But the review†ó brought on by May's terminal snooping scandal†ó led Bloomberg News Editor Clark Hoyt to write this report (via the New York Times): In one of the great campaigns of World War II, Monte Cassino was completely destroyed in a wave of battles that claimed 75,000 casualties and the lives of hundreds of townspeople. To suggest that a bond deal gone sour, curtailing daycare for 60 children and services for the poor, is comparable to the terror and cataclysm of war is inconsistent with BNís high standards. JP Morgan didn't disupte the meat of the story, just the Nazi allusions. From the report: JPMorgan objected to the headline and those paragraphs, saying they unfairly compared the bank to the Nazis. News considered this objection,†said its facts were correct (an assertion the bank did not dispute), and †stood by its story. A separate review also shed light on how Bloomberg journalists were able to use users' terminal information to inform their articles (and lurk on trader chatrooms). Reporters no longer have access to that information, according to the report. Bloomberg may have issued a mea culpa for the Nazi article, but the New York Times reported they have no plans to alter the original report. Read the full report at the New York Times&gt;

REUTERS / Brendan McdermidGoldman Sachs banker Jason Lee has been charged with allegedly raping a woman in an East Hampton rental home, the New York Times is reporting. The 37-year-old is a managing director in Goldman's equity capital markets group and now on leave, a bank spokesperson told the Times.  Court documents are not yet available, but the Times unearthed some preliminary details: Police officers responded on Tuesday to a report of a disturbance at the four-bedroom home Mr. Lee and his wife had rented this summer just north of the Montauk Highway. ‚ÄúWhile investigating, officers learned that a 20-year-old woman had been sexually assaulted inside the residence where several people had gathered,‚Äù the East Hampton police said in the statement. Lee's lawyer denied the allegations, saying that Lee was an "investment bank managing director who has never been in trouble in his life, never accused of any impropriety at all."

NasdaqNASDAQ index flatlines after the exchange halts trading Thursday afternoon.The NASDAQ has been down for more than three hours this afternoon due to a technical issue with the system that disseminates quotes for NASDAQ-listed stocks to other exchanges that also trade those stocks. Every NASDAQ-listed stock ‚Äì Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, etc. ‚Äì was halted. As a result, both the index and individual stocks flatlined. The exchange just reopened for trading at 3:25 PM ET, and shares of all three of those companies are rising, as is the broader index. Upon opening, NASDAQ declared "self help" against NYSE Arca, a signal that orders should be rerouted to other exchanges because NYSE Arca is having issues processing trades. The BATS Exchange also said it stopped routing orders to NYSE Arca as of 3:39. NASDAQ said the unprecedented trading halt this afternoon was due to a UTP SIP quote dissemination issue. (UTP stands for "unlisted trading privileges" and refers to the ability of other exchanges to trade securities listed on the NASDAQ. SIP stands for "securities information processor" and is the system that allows NASDAQ to send quotes for those securities to other exchanges.)
The big story in the markets today is the unprecedented trading halt of Nasdaq-listed stocks this afternoon. The halt began at 12:14 p.m. ET. Interestingly, shares of Apple began to fall minutes before the halt. Sure, it was a roughly $4 decline in a $500 stock. ¬†Still, it's interesting because the rest of the markets were holding up. In other news, activist investor Carl Icahn tweeted:¬†"Spoke to Tim. Planning dinner in September. Tim believes in buyback and is doing one. What will be discussed is magnitude" Icahn was referring Apple CEO Tim Cook. Here's the chart from Bloomberg: Bloomberg

NasdaqNASDAQ index flatlines after the exchange halts trading Thursday afternoon.Trading in stocks and options on the NASDAQ has been halted as of shortly after noon. Now, the exchange is saying trading in stocks will resume at 3:25 PM, while options trading will be back online at 3:35. NASDAQ says the trading halt is due to a UTP SIP quote dissemination issue. (UTP stands for "unlisted trading privileges" and refers to the ability of other exchanges to trade securities listed on the NASDAQ. SIP stands for "securities information processor" and is the system that allows NASDAQ to send quotes for those securities to other exchanges.) Shares of companies listed on the NASDAQ (not just options) ‚Äì like Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft ‚Äì have completely flatlined since shortly after noon. The index isn't falling, it's just completely halted. In fact, NASDAQ futures, which trade on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, initially fell when the trading halt was announced, but have since regained almost all of their losses. Both the NYSE and the BATS Exchange have halted trading in all NASDAQ-listed Tape C securities. The latest update from NASDAQ's website: NASDAQ OMX PHLX, NOM, and BX System Update: Equity Trading in NASDAQ Listed Securities is resuming at approximately 15:25 ET .

But the retailer has fallen on hard times, and today executives reported that sales are down 10%.¬† A myriad of bad decisions led to Abercrombie's status as a struggling retailer today, Brian Sozzi, chief equities strategist at Belus Capital, told us.¬† Sozzi shared a few reasons why Abercrombie is struggling.¬† 1. Competition from H&amp;M and Forever 21. These retailers' offerings are cheaper and trendier than the designs found at Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, Sozzi told us. "Abercrombie is no longer the only place in the mall for teens to get stuff to wear to school," he said.¬† 2. Teen values have shifted. "In 1999, we all wanted to fit in, but in 2013 it's about showing your identity by wearing unique accessories or clothes no one else has," Sozzi said. Other retailers like Urban Outfitters' Free People have gotten teens to spend full-price by offering more unique items, he said. But Abercrombie is perceived as boring.¬† 3. Abercrombie's clothes are too expensive. Abercrombie and competitor American Eagle "are simply not perceived by parents as offering the best bang for their buck," Sozzi said. Online shopping and apps have made shoppers more price-conscious than ever, making this trend likely to continue even as the economy improves.¬† So what can Abercrombie do to recover?¬† Offer more promotions to get people in stores and convert new customers, Sozzi says.¬† Abercrombie CEO Michael Jeffries outlined a similar strategy when he spoke with investors earlier today.¬† He also said the company will start opening outlets.¬†
Daniel Goodman / Business InsiderTrading on the NASDAQ halted Thursday afternoon due to a technical issue with something called UTP SIP quote dissemination. UTP, or "unlisted trading privileges" refers to the ability of other exchanges to trade stocks on the NASDAQ and SIP ("securities information processor") is the system by which NASDAQ sends quotes of those securities to other exchanges. Exchange officials are scrambling to a) figure out what happened and b) resume trading safely. At this point, everyone is just confused.†From the Wall Street Journal: "It's really shocking. We're stuck," said Ramon Verastegui, head of global engineering and strategy at SociÈtÈ GÈnÈrale. "If we want to trade Apple, we can't." With no new updates, CNBC pundits were locked in a talking heads decabox. The "market is too complicated" and "ridiculously complex" said†former Nasdaq Vice-Chair David Weild to CNBC. Both the NYSE and the BATS Exchange stopped trading in all NASDAQ-listed Tape C securities, per NASDAQ's request. Tape C securities are listed†on the†NASDAQ†or†NASDAQ†Small Cap exchange. NASDAQ now says it will resume trading†between 2:45 and 3:10 ET, but it had been largely radio silent since its†1 PM alert: NASDAQ intends to re-open trading in all Tape C securities with a halt cross with a 5-minute quote only period starting at a time to be determined.† NASDAQ will not be cancelling open orders on†the book.††Customers who wish to cancel their orders may do so and†any customer who wishes to not participate in the re-opening should cancel their orders prior to the resumption of trading. Additionally, NASDAQ will clear all stale quotes from the UTP SIP prior to the commencement of trading. A low volume day should mean the NASDAQ can get back on its feet, according to CNBC. But we're still waiting.
After a decade of rapid increases, employer-provided health care costs are still rising faster than our paychecks can keep up. According to a¬†new report¬†from the Kaiser Family Foundation, the average annual premium for families and individuals increased to $16,351 and¬†$5,884,¬†respectively, in 2013. Both costs have risen more than twice as fast as wage growth (1.8%) and four times as fast as inflation (1.1%). The big picture is even tougher to digest.¬† Health premiums shot up more than 80% over the last decade, the report shows, for both employers and employees. Businesses have seen their costs rise 80% since 2003, while their employees now pay 89% more for health care. ¬†On top of that, today more than one-third of workers are enrolled in health plans that come with at least a $1,000 deductible, meaning they are out a thousand bucks before their insurance even kicks in, Kaiser found. There's at least one positive side to the report, however. The rate of health care cost growth seemed to stagnate this year, which should help assuage some fears over whether the introduction of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) would mean higher premiums across the board.¬† ‚ÄúWe are in a prolonged period of moderation in premiums, which should create some breathing room for the private sector to try to reduce costs without cutting back benefits for workers,‚Äù Kaiser President and CEO Drew Altman, Ph.D., said in statement.¬† But it's not fair to credit Obamacare entirely for the slowdown in health care costs.¬† "Economists argue¬†that the lackluster economic recovery is leading Americans to seek out less health care services and point to the trend of employers keeping premiums lower by shifting costs into higher deductibles and co-pays," writes¬†Think Progress' Igor Volsky. "But certain¬†structural changes in the health care system¬†may also be at play, including the 'less rapid development of new medical care treatments,' greater reliance¬†on generic drugs¬†and more efficient provider practices."¬† Also helping matters, the majority of businesses are stepping in to make their workers healthier as a whole. More than three-quarters of employers offer at least one wellness program and nearly 60% offer at least one disease management program, Kaiser found.¬†
ShutterstockNormal, market-rate apartments in New York are incredibly expensive, and I‚Äôve explained why. But only 38% of rental apartments in New York are actually priced at the normal market rate. The city has about 1.3 million rental units that are subject, one way or another, to regulation or subsidy.¬† There are lots of cheap apartments out there. The problem is it's difficult to get one. This is the key problem with New York‚Äôs approach to affordable housing: It focuses on protecting incumbent residents, in some cases giving them huge discounts to market rents, while restricting supply and making it more difficult for new people to form households in New York. But occasionally, new tenants do get into subsidized or regulated housing in New York and achieve real savings. Here‚Äôs the guide for how you can try. 1. Apply for inclusionary housing lotteries and cross your fingers New York City's "inclusionary housing" program gives developers of new buildings an incentive to set aside a percentage of new apartments as affordable housing with restricted rents.¬†The development with the ‚Äúpoor door‚Äù that I wrote about on Monday is an example of this: 20% of its apartments will be set aside for people with low incomes.¬† These apartments can be deeply discounted: behind the poor door you'll find one bedroom apartments renting for about $1,000, less than a third of the going rate on the Upper West Side. Lots of people want these apartments, but there aren‚Äôt very many of them: only 2,800 have been built since the program started in 2005. To get one, you have to win a housing lottery.¬†To see a list of lotteries currently accepting applications, you can go here. The lotteries are income-restricted, but unless you‚Äôre making far into the six figures, you can probably find one that you qualify to enter. Some apartments are available to two-person households making as much as $180,000 a year. (So much for "middle-income housing.") But the biggest rent discounts apply to apartments with low income caps. To rent in the ‚Äúpoor door‚Äù building, you won‚Äôt be able make more than about $50,000 a year. Here‚Äôs the bad news: like the regular lottery, you're highly unlikely to win. The Real Deal¬†reported in 2011 that ‚Äúmany developments in the outer boroughs receive 15,000 applications for about 200 affordable housing units.‚Äù You can just imagine the competition in Manhattan. But here‚Äôs the good news: once you‚Äôre in, you‚Äôre in. So long as you met the income requirements when you moved in, you can stay in your inclusionary housing apartment as long as the building is regulated, even if you later become filthy rich. Typically, those regulations run for at least 20 years. 2. Find a rent-regulated apartment and hope market rents go up Rent regulation is by far the largest affordable housing program in New York, covering most of the rental apartments in the city that were built before 1974. Of the 3.1 million homes in New York City as of 2010, almost 1.1 million are subject to rent regulation. That doesn‚Äôt mean you can find a three-bedroom apartment in the West Village for $400 if only you look hard enough. First, a note on program names. Most people refer to rent regulation as ‚Äúrent control.‚Äù But confusingly, Rent Control is the name of a specific program that covers only about 50,000 very old apartments. In most cases, if a New Yorker says he has a ‚Äúrent controlled apartment,‚Äù he‚Äôs probably referring to rent stabilization, which covers about a million apartments in the city. Under rent stabilization, your rent can only go up by a fixed percentage each year, which is set annually by the Rent Guidelines Board to reflect rises in operating costs. This year, the allowable rise is 4%.¬†And your landlord has to offer you a renewal lease every year, until you move out voluntarily or die. If your relative has lived with you for two years upon your death, you can even pass the apartment to him or her. In a small fraction of cases, rent regulation means getting a big discount to market. Often, these cases are fictional. On Friends, rent regulation was how Rachel and Monica were able to afford their fabulous apartment while being marginally employed. But you, personally, are very unlikely to find a deal like this. More often, rent regulation leads only to a small discount to market rent or no discount at all. I currently live in a rent stabilized apartment where the legally allowable rent far exceeds the market rent. As a result, my lease reflects a ‚Äúrent preference‚Äù of several hundred dollars a month and I‚Äôm getting no savings from regulation. This happens for a few reasons. Most of the time in most neighborhoods, the legally allowable rent increase isn‚Äôt that different from the rise in market rents. It‚Äôs only in highly desirable neighborhoods, particularly in Manhattan below 96th street, that rent regulation has tended to mean big discounts to market rent. And when an apartment becomes vacant, landlords have lots of options to raise the rent back to market for the new tenant. Right off the bat, they get to raise the rent by 17%. Then, for every $40 they spend on capital improvements to the vacated apartment, they can raise the rent by $1, which means they can recoup the cost of renovation in less than four years. Smart landlords will use these options to make sure the legal maximum rent for a vacant apartment isn‚Äôt any lower than market rent. And if they get the rent up to $2,500, they can remove the apartment from regulation altogether. In the rare event that a landlord decides to rent out a vacant apartment at a substantially below-market rent, he‚Äôll be flooded with applications. His incentive is to choose the applicant with the highest income and best credit, and therefore least likelihood of defaulting‚Äîand the least need for help with housing affordability. In other words, you‚Äôre very unlikely to find an actually available rent-stabilized apartment with a way below market rent. In order to get one of those, you have to move in when market rents are low and stick around while rents rise around you. A lot of New Yorkers are doing just this: according to the Furman Center at New York University, 35% of rent-stabilized tenants have lived in the same apartment for more than 20 years, compared to just 3% of market-rate tenants. And it‚Äôs not hard to stick around, since there is almost no means test on rent stabilization: your landlord can only raise your rent to market if you make more than $175,000 a year for two consecutive years. 3. Get on waiting lists for middle-income ‚ÄúMitchell-Lama‚Äù housing Starting in the 1950s, New York state implemented a program that made a deal with developers: We‚Äôll give you big breaks on property taxes and mortgage rates if you provide affordable housing to residents. The ‚ÄúMitchell-Lama‚Äù developments built under this program (named after the state lawmakers who conceived it) are either rentals with restricted rents or ‚Äúlimited-equity co-ops,‚Äù where you can buy an apartment for a song and have to sell it back to management at a fixed price when you move out. There are about 110,000 such apartments in New York City, about 3% of the city‚Äôs housing stock. One of the largest of these developments is Penn South, occupying six city blocks in Chelsea, from 23rd Street to 29th Street and from 8th to 9th Avenue. As of 2011, a one-bedroom limited equity co-op at Penn South started around $40,000, with monthly maintenance charges of $400. That‚Äôs roughly an 85% discount compared to going rates for similar rental apartments. Google mapsThis isn't a housing project. Mitchell-Lama housing sounds like a great deal, and it can be. But there‚Äôs a catch. The most desirable developments (the ones in the best neighborhoods where the prices are farthest below market) have years-long waiting lists. The waiting list for Penn South is so long they‚Äôre not accepting new registrants.¬†But if you‚Äôre willing to live far into the outer boroughs, you can find a Mitchell-Lama development with no waiting list or one that will only take a few months to get in. You can find a list of developments with availability here. At Rochdale Village, you can buy a one-bedroom co-op for $7,200 with about $700 in monthly charges, and you‚Äôll only have to wait on a list for about six months to get one. The drawback is, Rochdale Village is so far east in Queens the subway doesn‚Äôt go there. Mitchell-Lama developments are income restricted, but the restrictions are pretty lax. In general, the ‚Äúmaximum‚Äù monthly income is seven times your rent, or seven times an estimated cost of ownership in the case of a limited-equity co-op. At Rochdale Village, the maximum income for that one-bedroom apartment is about $66,000. But you‚Äôre still eligible even if you make up to 150% of the ‚Äúmaximum,‚Äù you just have to pay a surcharge. Once you‚Äôre living in Mitchell-Lama housing, if you start earning more than 150% of the maximum income, you can theoretically be evicted. But in practice, this rule is rarely enforced, according to a 2007 inspector general‚Äôs report. It‚Äôs not hard to understand why. Tenants with high incomes are highly likely to pay their rent and common charges, plus they are subject to extra surcharges which generate more revenue. Management companies are not eager to evict them and replace them with tenants who pay less and have worse credit. 4. Try to move into a housing project or get Section 8 housing vouchers The first three options I discussed are available to people with moderate or even pretty high incomes. These two options are strictly for the poor. And they‚Äôre both so oversubscribed that, even if you are poor, they almost certainly still won‚Äôt help you. Section 8 housing vouchers are a federal subsidy for people who make less than 50% of the area median income. If you live in Manhattan, that‚Äôs a limit of $34,400 for a two-person household. Under the program, you get a voucher that helps you pay for a private apartment, generally limiting your effective rent to 30% of your income. You can‚Äôt get Section 8. All the vouchers are taken. There are over 120,000 people on the Section 8 waiting list in New York City. The New York City Housing Authority has not accepted new registrants on to the Section 8 waiting list since 2009. And then there are housing projects. These contain 179,000 apartments, and 227,000 families are on the waiting list to get one. As The New York Times reported last month, the waiting list is not first-in-first-out, as with Mitchell-Lama; it‚Äôs something of a black box and certain applicants can get in quickly while others wait forever. Project housing isn‚Äôt desirable, but it is cheap, if you can get it. As with Section 8, tenants must be poor, and rent is limited to 30% of income. The average rent for an apartment is $436.
statigr.am/xeque_279Financial advisors can smooth the path to financial independence for many people because they often calm people's nerves when markets are in panic mode. Still, I suggest that everyone give managing their own portfolio a try first, as it can be one of the most beneficial DIY projects to tackle. Here are some of the many reasons learning to¬†manage your own wealth¬†makes sense. Seeing wealth building first-hand will help you spend less. You may realize just how much your investments can earn over long stretches of time, which will motivate you to contribute more to your stash as early as possible. You may also realize that¬†reducing spending¬†just a bit can shave off years of slaving away at the work desk. It's much easier to understand the dynamics of saving and spending and how it affects your retirement if you are more in tune with your wealth. You should learn at least the basics before you let someone else touch your hard-earned money.¬†Financial advisors can be helpful, but only if you are able to find a good one. Without knowing the theories of good money management and investing principles, you may allow a financial advisor to legally siphon your hard-earned money into his or her own pockets without you even knowing. Even if you were lucky enough to find a good financial advisor, having sound investment principles will allow you to challenge the status quo enough for the advisor to pay more attention. All this will translate to your money fitting your needs more appropriately. You may have it in you to do it yourself. For those who have the passion to learn more than the basics and have the emotional control to stay the course during pessimistic times, doing it yourself means you can save all the¬†extra costs¬†of dealing with a financial advisor. After all, managing your own money can be simple to carry out, even though making the right moves may not be easy to do on a consistent basis. And speaking of fees, the costs extend beyond a yearly fee.¬†Whether you find an advisor who will take a percentage of your portfolio each year as compensation or one who takes a fixed amount per visit, there may be other costs associated with having someone else manage your portfolio. For example, you'll be paying full capital gains taxes on everything that's sold every time an advisor changes your holdings regardless of whether it's in your best interest to do so on an individual level. That‚Äôs not to say advisors won‚Äôt take your specific circumstances into consideration, but they often work with many clients and will buy and sell funds/equities in bulk that seem like a good idea for most people. You can always ask him or her to hold onto investments as long as you want them in your portfolio, but the calculations in figuring out what‚Äôs most efficient to you specifically will often fall on your own shoulders. There are non-financial costs as well.¬†All the time spent communicating, driving to appointments, the interview process when youselect a financial advisor, and so on are all costs that can be avoided if you do it yourself. Many advisors don't touch your retirement account, so you have to manage part of your wealth on your own anyway. Due to regulation, not every advisor will manage your retirement accounts, which defeats the purpose somewhat since you end up spending just as much time, but only managing part of your money. In fact, you might be spending even more time because all the time communicating with your advisor will be added on top of the time spent managing your retirement accounts. Your¬†asset allocation¬†can better reflect your circumstances if you do it yourself.¬†An advisor will tweak your plan based on what the advisor believes are your circumstances. But it is up to you to be articulate and patient enough to relay all your needs and wants to the financial advisor in the few meetings you have with him or her. Plus, many employ basic groups of portfolios to maximize economies of scale. This may end up fitting your circumstances perfectly, or it may not. How much are you willing to bet that what someone else is interpreting as your situation based on a few meetings will actually be the reality? You'll be able to make adjustments to your plan easily to better accommodate changing needs. There are lots of moving parts when you need to change your plan. The percentage needed to allocate to each investment, and whether it makes sense with all the tax laws affecting the after-tax benefit are just two details that need to be researched. Most financial advisors simply don't have the capability to deal with this for every client. What ends up happening is that many sub-optimal choices are made, with you bearing all the financial consequences. When you are managing the pot yourself, you will have the required knowledge to look further to see if any change makes sense, minimizing costs. Like I said, financial advisors can be a powerful aid in your path to a comfortable retirement. But for some, doing it yourself is the best route, bar none.

Even with the recent sell-off, the S&amp;P 500 is up a respectable 15% since the beginning of the year. The average equity hedge fund, however, is up by just 4.1% through August 9. This is according to a new report from Goldman Sachs equity strategy team. Goldman's Amanda Schneider, however, notes that the large long positions of hedge funds†ó as measured by Goldman's Hedge Fund VIP basket ó have actually done pretty well. It's the short positions that have been subtracting from gains. From Goldman's Amanda Schneider: The most important long positions have outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by about 300 bp so far in 2013. Our Hedge Fund VIP basket returned 23% through August 9 compared with 20% for the S&amp;P 500. Unfortunately, many widely-held short positions continue to outperform, offsetting the strong performance of popular longs and hampering overall hedge fund returns. Our basket of S&amp;P 500 stocks with the largest dollars of shorts has returned 20% YTD, in line with the S&amp;P 500. In addition, the 50 stocks over $1 billion market cap with the highest short interest as a percentage of market cap returned an average of 30%. Fully 12 of the 50 key short positions have returned more than three times the S&amp;P 500 return. See page 33. As you can see from this chart, hedge fund long positions are way out front. †Mutual funds are lagging the S&amp;P 500 by just a hair. †And the average hedge fund is way behind. Goldman Sachs

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. unemployment rate has been trending down. ¬†It currently sits at 7.4%. But is all of that about to change? Gallup has its own unemployment rate tracker. And in recent years, it has tended to lead the BLS's measure. Gallup's current 30-day rolling average unemployment rate has recently surged to a whopping 8.9%. "Daily results reflect 30-day rolling averages based on telephone interviews with approximately 30,000 adults," notes Gallup about their data. "Because results are not seasonally adjusted, they are not directly comparable to numbers reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which are based on workers 16 and older. Margin of error is ¬±1 percentage point." It's a jarring signal. Here's the chart from StreetTalkLive's Lance Roberts. Gallup

REUTERS/Mike SegarJob seekers speak with recruiters from retailer Abercrombie and Fitch at a career fair at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey, January 6, 2011.Teen clothing retailer Abercrombie &amp; Fitch reported second quarter earnings this morning before the opening bell, and shares are already down 18% Thursday trading. The company reported earnings of $0.16 per share (down 20% from last year) versus the $0.31 EPS predicted by analysts. Revenues also came in below expectations, at $945.7 million (down 1% from last year) versus $1.01 billion. Same-store sales fell 10% in Q2 ‚Äì down 11% in the United States and down 7% in international business. Meanwhile, guidance was lousy: Abercrombie expects third quarter earnings per share to come in a range of $0.40 to $0.45, well below the $1.06 EPS predicted by analysts. "The second quarter was more difficult than expected due to weaker traffic and continued softness in the female business, consistent with what others have reported. In that context we are planning sales, inventory and expenses conservatively for the remainder of the year," said Abercrombie CEO Mike Jeffries in the release. "Despite the challenging environment, we are very pleased by strong growth in our direct-to-consumer business and continued strong growth in China. We have also made excellent progress on our profit improvement initiative during the quarter, and we now expect savings from this initiative to exceed $100 million annually. In addition, we are nearing completion of our long-term strategic review, and we are confident that this will provide us with a clear roadmap for sustainable growth in sales, profitability and return on invested capital."

Since the opening bell rang at 9:30 AM, the stock market has been advancing. The S&amp;P 500 is currently trading at 1653, up 0.7% from yesterday's close. The oil &amp; gas and basic materials sectors are leading the way, both up 1.1%, while the telecoms sector is the only one in the red, down 0.6%. The biggest individual movers: GameStop, up 14.5%, Cliffs Natural Resources, up 8.3%, and Peabody Energy, up 4.8%. This morning before the bell, initial jobless claims for the week ended August 17 came in worse than expected at 336,000, up from 320,000 in the previous week. Economists had predicted 330,000 initial claims. At 8:58, Markit's flash U.S. manufacturing PMI indicator confirmed that American manufacturing is accelerating at the fastest pace in five months, yet the index failed to produce rise as much as economists on Wall Street were expecting. Nonetheless, stocks are rallying on the open. After soaring to fresh new multi-year highs of 2.94% in overnight trading, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note has retraced to current levels around 2.88%, below yesterday's close.

APReuters is reporting Thursday¬†on a strategy that appears to be picking up steam within the Republican Party ‚Äî moving on¬†from threatening a potential government shutdown to using the debt ceiling as leverage to force action on the Affordable Care Act.¬†There's not a lot new here from what GOP aides were discussing last week. But Reuters does report that an aide to House Majority Leader Eric Cantor said the debt limit could be a¬†"good leverage point" on Obamacare ‚Äî the most candid on-the-record admission that the strategy is being discussed in a proposal to appeal to the more conservative members of the party that want Obamacare defunded. According to discussions with aides last week, the GOP could pass a 60-day continuing resolution that keeps the government funded at existing levels under sequestration through the end of November ‚Äî right around the time the debt ceiling will need to be raised. Then, House leadership would use Democrats' wishes to get rid of sequestration levels to extract concessions.¬† But it is unclear right now where the Affordable Care Act would fit into this. Republicans could plausibly tie in delays in certain parts of the law ‚Äî which they still believe is the best strategy at eventually toppling the law altogether ‚Äî to certain roll-backs in sequestration-level funding, or to some kind of hike in the debt ceiling.¬† Some, like The Washington Post's Ezra Klein, are¬†already freaking out about this possibility, comparing the trade of a government shutdown fight for one over the debt ceiling to "trading the flu for septic shock." The possible breach of the debt ceiling ‚Äî and a default on obligations ‚Äî would be more catastrophic than a government shutdown, which would have real effects but would mostly come as an inconvenience. It also represents a very strategic risk for House Speaker John Boehner.¬† After the fiscal cliff deal in January, Boehner said in an interview with¬†the Wall Street Journal¬†that he did not¬†view the debt ceiling as the "ultimate leverage" in budget talks with Obama¬†in the near-term. He said that the sequester cuts would be better leverage,¬†and his gamble paid off. Republicans raised the debt ceiling without issue. Meanwhile, the sequester cuts began kicking in. And, so far, the doom and gloom predicted by the Obama administration hasn't been felt, in large part. Going back to making the debt ceiling a focal point represents a risk. The 2011 fight pummeled the Republican image, and it led to a downgrade in the nation's credit rating. It's also worth pointing out the negotiations on Obamacare would have to come¬†after¬†enrollment in insurance exchanges begins on Oct. 1. In essence, Republicans would be demanding a delay in Obamacare implementation as it is being implemented, in exchange for not letting the country default on its obligations.

REUTERS/Octavian CantilliThe Wall Street consensus is that economic growth in the United States will firm in the second half of 2013 and finally reach "escape velocity" in 2014 following years of slow growth in the wake of the financial crisis. This economic resurgence is expected to usher in a secular bull market for the U.S. dollar while continuing to propel the stock market to new all-time highs. Meanwhile, bond yields are expected to rise as the Federal Reserve normalizes monetary policy in response to an improving economy, removing a large source of demand from the bond market. Already, U.S. Treasuries have sold off substantially in response to the prospect that the Fed may begin to reduce the amount of bonds it purchases every month under its quantitative easing (QE) program as soon as its next FOMC meeting in mid-September, leaving the yield on the 10-year Treasury note at current levels around 2.87%. Deutsche Bank strategist¬†Makoto Yamashita departs from the consensus today in a note to clients, saying the sell-off that has gripped the Treasury market is likely over for now, the economy could go into cyclical decline after the Fed begins to taper back QE, and a further rise in stocks seems distant. Yamashita writes: U.S. and European long-term yields are on an uptrend, with the curve steepening. However, we do not expect the [10-year U.S. Treasury] yield to sustain a rise above 3% because this would mean the market has factored in a normalization of the US economy. The [five-year/five-year] forward rate has already exceeded 4%, but a move beyond 5% would return it to levels before the financial crisis in 2008. However, the world has changed since that time. Take inflation rates for example. The U.S. core PCE deflator, with a growth rate of below 1.5% [year over year], is unlikely to move sharply above growth of 2% necessary for monetary tightening. Financial institutions' balance sheets are also growing slowly, although this partly due to the low level of inflation. Growth in total assets held by U.S. commercial banks has recovered to 6% [year-over-year], but had risen to above 10% at times before the financial crisis. In addition, lending by European banks to the private sector continues to fall [year over year]. Regulatory officials worldwide have taken a stricter stance on risk taking by banks since the crisis. We do not believe inflation can be triggered in the current environment even if liquidity and balance sheet expansion by central banks leads to increased lending.  Investors are concerned about upcoming monetary tightening as the worldwide economy moves to a recovery. However, economic recoveries are partly cyclical in nature, so we see no guarantee that the economic recovery (tightening supply/demand gap) will be sustained at a level which necessitates a rate hike. In other words, the Fed's forward guidance for a rate hike when the unemployment rate reaches 6.5% will still be a long way off even if QE3 is tapered from September. We see the risk that the economy could enter a cyclical decline over that period. We believe a rise in both yields and stocks is distant. The Treasury market got hit hard yesterday on the release of the minutes from the July FOMC meeting, which suggested that the Fed may be on track to announce a tapering of QE at the conclusion of the next FOMC meeting on September 19. Selling overnight in Asia, sending the yield on the 10-year note to fresh new multi-year highs of 2.94%.

John HussmanFund manager John Hussman, who is one of the most disciplined, knowledgeable, and fact-based investors around, has struggled mightily in recent years. Hussman's valuation models and technical indicators have all been flashing yellow and red lights for years. As a result, Hussman has positioned his funds cautiously...and therefore missed out on some of the bonanza that has powered stocks to extraordinary new highs. As any investment professional will tell you, on Wall Street you have about 90 days to be "right." If you make a market call that goes against you for longer than 90 days, you're not considered "early" or "prudent" or "careful." You're considered "wrong." And, soon, if you stick to your guns, people begin to regard you as a religious fanatic--too wedded to your incompetency and pride to admit your mistake and join the happy, comfortable, consensus herd. And then people write you off as a "perma-____" and stop listening to you. Hussman's caution and underperformance over the last few years have damaged his reputation and caused a lot of people to stop listening to him. And that's too bad. Because sometimes big market trends take a long time to play out. And, sometimes, it's only after a bold, stubborn analyst has been dismissed as an out-of-touch charlatan that a market imbalance is finally corrected. I will go out on a limb here and say that I think there's a good chance that John Hussman will ultimately be proven right. Even if the market doesn't actually crash, I think it's highly likely that stock returns will be lousy for the next ten years. Yes, as John Hussman will be the first to admit, there's also a chance that it's different this time and that his caution is unwarranted. But it's worth stressing that that is the only way John Hussman will not ultimately be proven right--if it's "different this time." Robert Shiller, YaleThe Shiller "cyclically adjusted price-earnings ratio"--one of many indicators that suggest stocks are significantly overvalued.Because every historical indicator Hussman is looking at is suggesting that the stock market is wildly overvalued and headed for a period of lousy returns. How lousy? John Hussman thinks there's a good chance the stock market will soon crash 40%-50%. A crash of that magnitude would take the DOW from 15,000 to 7,500-8,500. And even if the market doesn't crash Hussman thinks stocks are priced to produce returns of only a couple of percentage points per year over the next decade--far below the 7% inflation-adjusted long-term return that everyone is used to and the double-digit returns of the last few years. If you want to feel comfortable and happy, go ahead and ridicule John Hussman with everyone else. If you want to prepare yourself for what seems like a likely possible stock-market future, however, read on... Frankly, I wonder whether any amount of arm-waving will incline investors to actually examine their risk exposures here, much less consider the prospect of a 40%+ decline in the S&amp;P 500 Index that would be required simply to bring stocks to historically run-of-the-mill valuations. But at a time when our estimates of prospective risk are surging, I would be remiss not to observe that fact. At present, we have what might best be characterized as a broken speculative peak, in that market internals (particularly interest-sensitive groups), breadth and leadership have broken down uniformly following an extreme overvalued, overbought, overbullish syndrome. If you recall, the market also recovered to new highs in October 2007, weeks after the initial, decisive break in market internals at that time. Presently, we‚Äôre looking at the same set of circumstances. On some event related to tapering or the Fed Chair nomination, we may even see another push higher. It isn't simply short-term risk, but deep cyclical risk that is of concern. My main goal here is to encourage investors to look carefully at their investment positions, before they lose the chance to alter them advantageously. As I noted in the October 15, 2007 market comment¬†Warning ‚Äì Examine All Risk Exposures: ‚ÄúWhatever market exposure investors accept today ought to be the same market exposure that investors are committed to maintain for the duration of a bear market, without abandoning their investment plan. Investors with no plan to own stocks through a market decline, holding them only in the hope of selling at market highs, may discover in hindsight that these were them.‚Äù In fact, they were. I get it. Nobody cares. This time is different. The Fed will not allow ‚Äì allow ‚Äì stocks to go lower. There‚Äôs no question that a few binary events ‚Äì mainly the likely ‚Äútapering‚Äù of quantitative easing, and the choice of a new Fed Chairman ‚Äì creates significant uncertainty about the short term. My concerns are more extended, and are specifically related to the likelihood that the present market cycle will complete in a way ‚Äì as market cycles have historically ‚Äì that wipes out more than half of the gains of the preceding bull market advance. My impression is that the losses even in a not-so-terrible completion of the present cycle may come closer to three-quarters of those gains. Keep reading here &gt; Now, even if take Hussman's warnings seriously, it's still tough to figure out what you should do about it. Bonds and cash also look like lousy investments these days, and real-estate isn't exactly a screaming buy. So even if you conclude that there's a good chance that stocks might drop 40%-50%, you might decide just to ride the plunge out. But at least you will have been prepared for it. You have been warned!
REUTERS/Tyrone Siu (Reuters) - An elaborate¬†temple-like structure perched on an apartment block in¬†southeastern China¬†is an illegal hazard that should be torn down, residents say. But they may not be as lucky as opponents of a lavish¬†rooftop¬†villa in¬†Beijing. The¬†temple¬†in¬†Shenzhen¬†is believed to have been on the roof for about seven years but the complaints have hit the spotlight only after a doctor in¬†Beijing¬†was given 15 days to demolish his 800-square-metre (8,600-square-foot) house and garden built illegally atop a 26-storey apartment block. Although the roof of the building in¬†Shenzhen¬†is supposed to be a public space, a fingerprint-activated lock stops others from accessing it, according to media reports. REUTERS/Tyrone Siu Chen Jiatao, chairman of the complex's housing management committee, said the¬†temple's owner must resolve the matter by opening the space to other residents but he seemed to hold out little hope. "I once spoke with the past chairman, who was here for seven years," Chen told Reuters Television. "He said this to me: 'Oh my, don't you know? This person is an official, he has friends in high places.' So it's useless." A disregard for laws and regulations by the rich and well-connected is a source of discontent among many Chinese. REUTERS/Tyrone Siu The¬†temple¬†and inaccessible¬†rooftop¬†have raised concerns about safety. For residents on higher floors, the roof would be the main escape route in case of fire, while the added weight from the illegal structure could threaten the building's stability, media reports say. Apartments in the building sell for around 30,000 yuan ($4,900) per square meter and the¬†rooftop¬†itself is worth more than 15 million yuan ($2.45 million), according to¬†the South China Morning Post.

Hannes Magerstaedt/Getty Images (Reuters) -¬†Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co¬†(ANF.N),Aeropostale Inc¬†(ARO.N) and¬†American Eagle Outfitters¬†Inc (AEO.N) have fallen out of¬†fashion¬†with fickle U.S. teen shoppers and aren't likely to win back their¬†business¬†anytime soon. The retailers, known as the "3As," have long been popular for their cool basics like jeans, hoodies and t-shirts. But young shoppers are now less interested in their logo-centric clothes and more eager to shop forelectronics¬†or go to low-cost, fast-fashion chains like Zara, Forever 21 and H&amp;M that offer greater variety more quickly. "The teen retailers seem to be not in style or in vogue at this point in time for their target consumers," said Bryan Keane, portfolio manager of the Alpine Global Consumer Growth Fund. "That usually does not turn around quickly," American Eagle on Wednesday gave a weak forecast for the fall, sending its shares to their lowest levels in a year and a half. American Eagle Chief Executive Robert Hanson told analysts the level of price slashing now is "unprecedented." Aeropostale earlier this month said that comparable sales fell 15 percent last quarter, and Wall Street analysts expect¬†earnings¬†per share to fall by more than two-thirds to 21 cents this year. It will report full quarterly results on Thursday, as will Abercrombie. Last week, Barclays lowered its profit estimate on Abercrombie because of the "intense promotional environment." One of the big problems the 3A's face is a narrower clientele than that of H&amp;M (HMb.ST) and of Gap Inc (GPS.N), which draw shoppers of all ages. American Eagle gets about 80 percent of sales from its standard merchandise, and Hanson conceded that it's been tough to compete as his company tries to offer more¬†fashion, more quickly. "This team (young shoppers) wants to be fashionable but they don't want to spend a lot of money, and fast fashion works very well for that," said Eric Beder, a Brean Capital analyst, who has a sell recommendation on Aeropostale. For example, H&amp;M sells V-neck men's t-shirts for as low as $5.95, while Aeropostale t-shirts on clearance on Wednesday were priced at $6.99. The result has been the constant pressure to discount. American Eagle's gross margin fell 3.6 percentage points last quarter to 33.8 percent of sales, below a more typical level of 40 percent. Abercrombie declined to comment ahead of the its earnings, while Aeropostale and American Eagle did not return messages seeking comment. FAST FASHION The competition has only grown more intense as U.S. government statistics show young shoppers have gradually directed more of their spending toward electronics and less on clothes. This comes as teens are facing lower employment levels this year, according to Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas, and their parents are grappling with higher payroll taxes, gasoline prices and a slow job recovery. On top of all that, the three chains are facing an ever more crowded field as international 'fast-fashion' rivals are aggressively expanding in the United States. H&amp;M, a Swedish retailer, said its U.S. sales rose 10 percent in the first half of 2013 and it just launched a U.S. e-commerce site. It has 269 U.S. stores, after opening 40 last year. Uniqlo, owned by Japan's Fast Retailing (9983.T), is opening six more U.S. stores this fall with a goal of having 200 by 2020. U.S. sales at Zara, owned by Spain's Inditex S.A. (ITX.MC), more than tripled between 2007 and 2012, according to Euromonitor International. U.S. rivals are also stealing market share from the 3A's: Forever 21 Inc's sales rose 82 percent during that period. These new chains are bringing new products, such as Uniqlo long johns that warm up on touch, making it risky to offer the same-old, same-old. "There isn't a lot of innovative clothing out there for anyone, and there are plenty of other places to buy clothes if you want," said Wendy Liebmann, CEO of WSL Strategic Retail. Aeropostale is moving away from its logo business, and adding more expensive, fashionable items. But KeyBanc analyst Ed Yruma said in a note last week the move is a "tacit acknowledgement that the targeted teen customer base may have moved elsewhere." Last year, many apparel chains got a boost from the bright color jeans craze. But this year, analysts say there is no such must-have to bring teens into the stores. "Sometimes, you have something unique that everyone has to have," said Jessica Bemer, an analyst with Snow Capital Management. "But the look is going to be very similar this year to last year.

Jamie Squire/Getty Images U.S. housing prices grew in June, with the FHFA House Price Index rising to 0.7%, beating expectations of 0.6%. Prices rose 2.1% in Q2 from the previous quarter, the eighth¬†consecutive quarterly price increase, according to the report. Homebuilder confidence has surged this year, but some economists are beginning to expect the pace of home prices will cool off soon as the impact of rising mortgage rates permeate. Here's the full release: Washington, D.C. ‚Äì Upward momentum in U.S. house prices remained strong in the second¬†quarter, as prices rose 2.1 percent from the previous quarter, according to the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) House Price Index (HPI). This is the eighth consecutive¬†quarterly price increase in the purchase-only, seasonally adjusted index. ‚ÄúThe housing market experienced one of its strongest quarters since the boom in the middle of the last decade,‚Äù said FHFA Principal Economist Andrew Leventis.¬†The HPI is calculated using home sales price information from mortgages sold to or guaranteed¬†by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Compared with last year, house prices rose 7.2 percent from the second quarter of 2012 to the second quarter of 2013. FHFA‚Äôs seasonally adjusted ¬†monthly index for June was up 0.7 percent from May. FHFA‚Äôs expanded-data house price index, a metric introduced in August 2011 that adds¬†transaction information from county recorder offices and the Federal Housing Administration to the HPI data sample, rose 2.4 percent over the latest quarter. Over the last four quarters, that index is up 7.5 percent. For individual states, price changes reflected in the expanded-data measure and the traditional purchase-only HPI are compared on pages 31-33 of this report. The seasonally adjusted, purchase-only HPI rose 7.2 percent from the second quarter of 2012 to the second quarter of 2013 while prices of other goods and services rose only 1.0 percent. The inflation-adjusted price of homes rose approximately 6.2 percent over the latest year. Significant Findings: The seasonally adjusted purchase-only HPI rose in 47 states and in the District of Columbia during the second quarter. Top 5 in annual appreciation: 1) Nevada¬†2) California 3) Arizona 4) Oregon and 5) District of Columbia. Of the nine census divisions, the Pacific division experienced the strongest increasein the latest quarter, posting a 4.6 percent increase and a 16.2 percent increase since last year. House prices were weakest in the East South Central division, where prices increased 0.9 percent from the prior quarter. As measured with purchase-only indexes for the 100 most populated metropolitan areas in the U.S., second quarter price increases were greatest in the Orlando Kissimmee-Sanford, FL Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) where prices increased¬†by 10.0 percent. Prices were weakest in the Akron, OH MSA, where they fell 3.9¬†percent over that period. The monthly seasonally adjusted purchase-only index for the U.S. has increased for¬†the last 17 consecutive months.¬†FHFA‚Äôs ‚Äúdistress-free‚Äù house price indexes, which were published for 12 large metropolitan areas on page 47, generally report lower quarterly appreciation than FHFA‚Äôs traditional¬†purchase-only indexes. In eight of the 12 areas covered, the new series‚Äîwhich removes short¬†sales and sales of bank-owned properties‚Äîshows lower quarterly appreciation than the¬†purchase-only series. The complete list of state appreciation rates is on pages 28-29. The list of metropolitan area appreciation rates computed in a purchase-only series is on pages 44-46. Appreciation rates for the all-transactions metropolitan area indexes are on pages 50-62. Click here to see the full release&gt;
APPresident Barack Obama on Thursday will unveil a broad plan to lower the cost of college, the highlight of which involves a new ratings system that ties the federal government's allocation of financial aid to the ratings system.† Obama's plan would instruct the Department of Education to rank colleges with their peers, according to new measures that evaluates their success and affordability.† Some of these measures, according to the White House, include the following: Obama will talk about this plan during two stops on a bus tour in Buffalo and Syracuse, N.Y., on Thursday.Obama wants the ratings system to be in place by the 2015 school year. If all goes well, the government would start allocating financial aid according to the system by 2018 ó a time span that would give colleges opportunity to adjust for the new system.†Students attending higher-performing colleges could receive larger Pell Grants and more affordable student loans, the White House said. It's clear that Obama wants major changes in the cost of higher education. In an email to supporters on Wednesday night, he emphasized that the U.S. needs to "fundamentally rethink" its approach to the cost of higher education.† "Just tinkering around the edges won't be enough: To create a better bargain for the middle class, we have to fundamentally rethink about how higher education is paid for in this country. We've got to shake up the current system," Obama said in the email.† The administration can produce its ranking system on its own, but the power to enforce it and change the way federal aid is allocated would require Congressional approval. As has become customary with Obama's recent economic-themed speeches, the backdrop looms of a showdown with Congressional Republicans over raising the debt ceiling and avoiding a government shutdown.†

Claims climbed to 336,000 from 323,000 a week ago. This was a tad higher than the 330,000 expected by economists. Despite the uptick, the level of claims still remain at pre-recession levels. The 4-week moving average was 330,500, down from last week's average of 332,750. This is the lowest level since November 2007. Markets are doing little in the wake of the report.

Flickr/Deborah LeighMany market watchers these days warn that good news can be bad news, especially for central bankers who are trying to justify their stimulative loose monetary policies. Earlier today, the preliminary (Flash) PMI reports across Europe continued to confirm that the eurozone economic recovery is real. "As they stand, PMI indices look consistent with ongoing activity expansion in H2 in core countries and thus in the Eurozone as a whole," said Credit Agricole's Frederik Ducrozet. "With the usual caveats in mind, including empirical evidence that monthly changes in PMIs, not only levels, matter for growth, composite PMI indices would be consistent with quarterly GDP growth of around +0.2-0.3% QoQ in the Eurozone in Q3 (following +0.3% in Q2), +0.5% QoQ in Germany (down from +0.7%) and 0.0-0.2% in France (down from +0.5%), roughly in line with our current forecasts." But Ducrozet warns that good news may be bad news for the European Central Bank (ECB). From his note to clients: At the same time, it may become increasingly difficult for the Governing Council to convince the market that the newly adopted forward-guidance will mean policy rates will remain low (or lower) for an extended period of time. Eventually, below-target inflation should provide the ECB with the most natural fundamental argument to back its position, but more clarity could be needed should the relative decoupling between US and Euro bond markets break down. We have long argued that the ECB would act to prevent such a passive tightening to negatively affect Eurozone growth, and indeed, if need be, there are still plenty of tools at its disposal to buy more time, including rate cuts (less likely now than before the summer), a more specific time horizon or quasi-thresholds for its forward guidance, or additional liquidity management measures conveying the idea that rates will indeed remain low for longer than what standard reaction functions would imply (including, for instance, the implementation of another ultra-long refinancing operation at fixed rate). Time will tell whether the ECB needs to react, but in the meantime the Governing Council will have to deal with the uncomfortable idea that not all parameters are under its control. ¬†Credit Agricole
Andrew Burton/Getty Images)Britain's high street banks are embroiled in a major new scandal after it was announced that seven million people who were mis-sold credit card and identity protection policies will share up to ¬£1.3bn in compensation. Thirteen banks and credit card companies, including Barclays, HSBC and Royal Bank of Scotland, have agreed to offer redress for the widely mis-sold policies, with payouts ‚Äì likely to average ¬£185 per person ‚Äì likely in spring 2014. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said the firms, together with card insurer CPP, had agreed to a compensation package which will see millions of letters being mailed out to affected customers from 29 August onwards. The fiasco is the latest in a line of scandals and regulatory clampdowns to hit the banking sector. Earlier this month it was estimated that the cost to banks of compensating customers mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI) had reached ¬£18.4bn, while the Libor rate-rigging scandal, the mis-selling of other products such as interest rate swaps and the outcry over bankers' bonuses have also shaken the sector and led to calls for reforms. "Card protection", which typically cost around ¬£35 a year and is supposed to help with canceling and replacing cards if they are lost or stolen, and "identity protection", which typically cost around ¬£80 a year, were widely mis-sold by CPP, resulting in the firm being hit with a ¬£10.5m fine in November 2012. However, most of those affected took out a CPP policy via their bank or card company. The FCA said customers were given misleading and unclear information about the policies so that they bought cover that either was not needed, or to cover risks that had been greatly exaggerated. Seven million customers, who between them bought and renewed around 23m policies, will receive a letter from CPP giving more information on the process, with another mail-out due in the autumn. "The redress bill could be up to ¬£1.3bn, with redress per customer depending on the type of policy (or policies) owned and the length of time it was held," said the FCA. The compensation scheme has to be voted on by customers and approved by the high court before it can go ahead. Assuming this happens, all customers will need to do is complete a simple claim form, said the regulator. The scheme will be open to anyone who bought or renewed the card protection product since 14 January 2005 (when the FCA began regulating the sale of general insurance products) from CPP or one of the participating banks or card companies, and all those who bought or renewed identity protection from CPP since 14 January 2005 by phone. If customers are due compensation, they will be entitled to the amount they have paid for their policy since 14 January 2005, minus any money paid out by the policy, plus 8% interest on the sum owed. The 13 banks and card firms taking part in the scheme are Bank of Scotland (part of Lloyds Banking Group), Barclays, Canada Square Operations Limited (formerly Egg), Capital One, Clydesdale Bank, Home Retail Group Insurance Services Limited, HSBC, MBNA, Morgan Stanley, Nationwide building society, Santander, RBS and Tesco Personal Finance. Many of the banks "introduced" their customers to CPP by fixing a sticker to new credit or debit cards sent to customers. It prompted the customer to call a number, which was CPP's, either to activate the card or to confirm receipt. When the customer did ring, CPP also used the opportunity to offer card protection and/or identity protection. The card protection product was often rebranded by the banks that sold them. Many experts say it is the insurance elements of the products that are almost always a waste of money. Card protection offered ¬£100,000 of cover if someone was the victim of fraud because of a stolen card ‚Äì but banks cover people for this anyway. Dan Plant at the MoneySavingExpert.com website set up by Martin Lewis said: "It's important that redress is finally being sorted after another systemic mis-selling scandal from the banks for what were largely useless policies. "A note of caution is needed as we cannot afford for this be delayed any further. Existing complaints have been put on hold, and new ones not allowed while this scheme is sorted. We're crossing all our fingers and toes that this doesn't turn into another PPI debacle, with legitimate claims being endlessly ignored." This article originally appeared on guardian.co.uk

In June of this year, we marked the fourth anniversary of the official end of the Great Recession as determined by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER). I've intentionally selected the word "marked" over the more optimistic celebrated" after reading the stunning report just released by Sentier Research: Household Income On the Fourth Anniversary of the Economic Recovery: June 2009 to June 2013. The press release in PDF format is available here at the Sentier Research website. The full report, 27 pages of richly detailed data on median household incomes, is available for a modest fee here, and I highly recommended a close study of the full report for anyone with a keen interest in the demographics of the U.S. economy. The press release opens with the initial stunner, one which comes as no surprise to those of us who follow the monthly Sentier Research updates:¬† Before we dig into the new findings, let's have a quick look at an overlay of nominal and real (inflation adjusted) median household incomes since the turn of the century based on Sentier Research's monthly reports of the real, seasonally adjusted data: ¬† ¬† Additional charts and a discussion of this 13-year timeframe are available at this permanent link, which I update monthly. Today's new report from the company includes breakdowns of the median data in multiple ways: by type of household, age of householders, employment status of householders, number of earners, race and ethnicity, education and much more. In this commentary I'll focus on two of these broad areas: age and race/ethnicity. In follow-up commentaries, I'll explore some of the other findings.  The first table below gives us two snapshots in time (June 2009 and June 2013) of all households and seven constituent age cohorts -- under 25, 75 and over, and the five 10-year cohorts in between. The two rightmost columns show the percent change in 1) the number of households per cohort and 2) the real (inflation-adjusted) median incomes of the cohorts. The incomes for 2009 have been adjusted for inflation using the Consumer Price Index.¬† ¬† The column chart below highlights the rather dramatic impact of the Baby Boom generation entering the 55-64 and 64-65 cohorts. We also see the substantially smaller imprint of the Echo Boom.  ¬† The columns above are further illuminated by a look at the ratio of births to the total population during the last century.¬† ¬† As we saw in the table above, the real median income for all households has shrunk 4.4% since the end of the recession. As the next set of columns shows us, three of the age cohorts have fared statistically worse than the "all households" category, and three have fared better -- although only the two oldest cohorts have experienced growth.¬† ¬† The "Under 25" group has suffered the most shrinkage, a topic I'll look at more closely in a follow-up commentary where we'll look at important trends in part-time employment and accelerated efforts by many people to improve their human capital through education. The 25 to 35 cohort is not statistically different from the 4.4% "All Households" decline. The 45 to 50 cohort, which has historically been the peak earning years (more on that topic here), has also seen a real income decline, but less severe than that of the total population. The two "elderly" cohorts, a term I use respectfully as a youngster in this rapidly growing population, are the only two to show growth, with the 65 to 74 age group as the standouts. What we're seeing in both of the older groups is largely the result of two things: The next table compares the households by race and ethnicity at the end of the Great Recession with the statistics four years later. As in the table above, the two rightmost columns document the change in the number of households and the change in real median household incomes for the cohorts.¬† ¬† A column chart shows the remarkable growth of two categories: "Other Race Combinations, Not Hispanic" and "Hispanic".¬† ¬† Although the chart above shows the comparative growth, it doesn't reveal the relative dimensions of the four categories within the overall household population. A pair of pie charts provides a telling visualization of the change over the four-year period relative to total population growth. To one decimal place, Black households make up the same percentage of total households at 12.3% In fact, had I calculated two decimals there would be no change at 12.30%. Hispanic households have now fractionally overtaken Black households as the second largest group. Despite its greater growth, the "Other Combinations, Not Hispanic" category, which includes Asians, remains the smallest, at slightly more than half the number of the Hispanic households. ¬† ¬†¬† The next chart illustrates the deeply disturbing decline in the real median income for black households, which have seen a 10.9% drop in real household incomes since the end of the recession. Hispanic household incomes have also slipped but, by a percentage that is statistically no different from the "All Households" number.  ¬† The chart above is all the more disturbing when we look at the real household incomes themselves. In June 2009 the median annual income for Black households was 31.8% lower than the total median household income. Four years later the gap has widened to 36.4%. For Hispanic households, the 22.1% gap from all households in June 2009 is essentially unchanged four years later at 22.2%. The findings of Sentier Research in the area of Race and Ethnicity come exactly one week before President Obama will mark the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King's "I Have a Dream" speech (more here). The President is expected to focus new attention on civil rights and racial prejudice. Among the many topics he might address (voter registration, racial profiling, courtroom justice, etc.), the growing financial inequality among households is one that will resonate with anyone who has studied the data. In another commentary I'll explore additional aspects of Sentier Research's blockbuster report, including household composition and education.
Wikimedia CommonsFrance's flash PMI reading surprised to the downside this morning, but Germany's came in better than expected, as did figures for the eurozone as a whole, and markets across Europe are flying higher. The Spanish IBEX 35 and Italian FTSE MIB are leading the way, currently up 1.8%, while the German DAX is up 1.1%, the French CAC 40 is 1.0% higher, and the London FTSE is up 0.8%. In the United States, S&amp;P 500 futures are rallying, currently up 0.4%. Meanwhile, the bloodletting in the U.S. Treasury market continues following the release of the minutes yesterday from the Federal Reserve's July FOMC meeting. Early this morning, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note hit a fresh new multi-year high of 2.94% before retracing a bit to current levels around 2.92%. Overnight, the release of China's flash PMI reading revealed that the country's manufacturing sector unexpectedly stopped contracting and began expanding this month. The Japanese Nikkei 225 closed down 0.4%, while the Hong Kong Hang Seng advanced 0.4% and the Shanghai Composite fell 0.3%. The next big market mover is the release of weekly jobless claims figures in the United States, due out at 8:30 AM ET.¬†Economists predict initial claims rose to 330,000 in the week ended August 17 from 320,000 the week before. Continuing claims are expected to have ticked down to 2.965 million in the week ended August 10 from 2.969 million in the previous week.
Wikimedia CommonsThe release of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's July FOMC meeting yesterday sparked a sharp sell-off in the U.S. Treasury market. The selling continued overnight in Asian trading, and early this morning, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to another new multi-year high of 2.94%. Since then, yields have retraced slightly to 2.92%, but 10-year Treasury futures are still down 0.4% today. "The stakes have been upped for the bond market this summer and the short-lived reaction and relief (lower yields) to the wobble in emerging markets confirmed that investors are desperate to avoid being caught out by strong incoming data and reduced asset purchases by the Fed next month," says Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale analyst Kenneth Broux. "The FOMC minutes yesterday did not try to dampen expectations that tapering could start in September and US yields duly pushed to 2.93% in Asia (swaps 3.14%), supporting the USD but giving EM currencies another headache." The next big market mover is the release of weekly jobless claims figures in the United States, due out at 8:30 AM ET.¬†Economists predict initial claims rose to 330,000 in the week ended August 17 from 320,000 the week before. Continuing claims are expected to have ticked down to 2.965 million in the week ended August 10 from 2.969 million in the previous week. The bond market has been on edge for most of 2013 as the prospect of a reduction in the pace of bond purchases the Federal Reserve makes under its quantitative easing program has become more and more likely with each strengthening economic data point. Now, the consensus on Wall Street holds that the Fed will begin this "tapering" process at its next FOMC meeting in mid-September. Today's claims release may give us an additional clue as to whether or not this will prove to be the case. "The lack of conviction for September [tapering] largely stems from lingering uncertainty over the underlying health of the labor market and the broader economy," says Deutsche Bank economist Joe LaVorgna. "As such, the August employment report, which is released on September 6, is likely to be the defining event. Ahead of this, the trend in jobless claims will be closely scrutinized, given this series‚Äô prowess as a payroll forecasting tool." The chart below shows trading in 10-year Treasury futures.

REUTERS/Ralph OrlowskiThe euro currency sign sculpture with a damaged star stands in front of the headquarters of the European Central Bank (ECB) prior to the monthly ECB news conference in Frankfurt, August 1, 2013.In a recent note, Oppenheimer chief market strategist John Stoltzfus¬†passed along an interesting anecdote: "Stateside investors are beginning to consider investments in Europe and elsewhere ex-U.S. for diversification once again as multiples expand stateside¬†and hints that conditions are beginning to improve outside of the U.S.,¬†particularly in the developed European markets, emanate." And as the latest flash PMI data out of the euro area this morning seem to confirm that the economy is turning a corner, the European comeback story is picking up speed. Last week, flows into European equity funds were the biggest in more than two years ‚Äì at $2.3 billion ‚Äì while investors pulled money out of U.S. equity funds for the first time in seven weeks. The Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale global asset allocation team, led by strategist¬†Alain Bokobza,¬†is optimistic that this is the beginning of something much bigger. In a note to clients titled "European equities should enjoy net inflows of $100bn soon," the team writes: Europe still missing $100bn of net inflows:¬†No wonder equity market performance in Europe has been lagging that of the US since 2007. Looking at cumulative net inflows into European equity markets since then, it would take $100bn of net inflows to close the gap that has developed. The contrast with cumulative net inflows into other equity markets is startling: the US, Japan and especially Emerging Markets are all in positive territory already. Fed exit to change balance between US and European assets:¬†We firmly believe that Fed tapering will favour European assets relative to US assets. Although the flows have been particularly thin this summer, the latest data confirm that net inflows are picking up for European equities, whereas they are slowing for US equities.¬† New weekly fund flows data are out this afternoon, so we will get a chance to see if this was just a one-off or a continued trend.

flickr/Unnar ›mir BjˆrnssonOvernight, the flash reading of China's August Purchasing Manager Index (PMI) indicated that the country's manufacturing sector unexpectedly stopped contracting and began expanding over the past month. Specifically, the headline PMI index rose to 50.1 from July's 47.7 reading, beating consensus expectations for a slighter rise to 48.2 (any number below 50 on the index indicates contraction, whereas any number above 50 indicates expansion). Following the release, BofA Merrill Lynch economist Ting Lu, who is bullish on the Chinese economy, asserted that†"many Street economists will likely to revise up their overly pessimistic 3Q GDP growth forecasts soon." Deutsche Bank economist Jun Ma did just that today. "We revise up our H2 GDP growth forecast largely as a result of the improvement in recent indicators including today's August flash HSBC PMI report," writes Jun in a note to clients. "Specifically, we raise our Q3 GDP growth forecast to 7.7% yoy from the previous 7.5%, and raise our Q4 forecast to 7.8% from 7.7%. As a result of these changes, our H2 GDP growth is upgraded by 0.1ppt to 7.7% vs. market consensus of 7.5%." Jun expanded on the call, linking the PMI report to the bigger picture: The recent pickup in growth momentum, which will likely continue in our view, benefited from the following changes in the last one and half months: 1) inventory restocking, which began in late July, driven by the recovery in prices of raw materials such as steel, coal, and copper; 2) the recovery in corporate confidence due to a slew of policy announcements is beginning to boost their incentive to investment. These policies include the tax exemptions for micro firms, the setting up of the Railway Development Fund to speed up railway construction, an increase in railway investment target for this year and the likely increases for coming few years, as well as a ambitious plan to invest in environmental and energy savings projects; 3) many real estate developers are beginning to increase land purchase and launch new projects due to strong pre-sales and a more accommodative policy environment. These real estate activities will likely help push up local government revenue and in term help support infrastructure spending in the remainder of this year and next year.  Today's HSBC flash PMI report is an additional confirmation of this recovery trend. It rose sharply to 50.1 in August from 47.7 in July, and is much higher than the consensus expectation of 48.2. As the official PMI in August tends to increase by an average of 0.4pts from July due to seasonality, we believe that the official PMI for August (to be released on September 1) will likely confirm this uptrend shown by the flash report. Given that August PMI is better than July, and assuming September PMI remains at the average of July-August, it means that IP growth in Q3 will likely reach 9.7% yoy, up from 9.1% in Q2. This acceleration in IP growth should easily add 0.2ppt to yoy GDP growth in Q3, from Q2's 7.5%. SociÈtÈ GÈnÈrale economist Wei Yao agrees that China is on track for above-consensus growth in the third quarter following the flash PMI report. "All major activity data are now moving in the same direction, indicating a much- strengthened growth momentum in Q3," says Wei. "a rebound in GDP growth in Q3 is almost certain and data so far point to something around 7.7% yoy." However, Wei warns that it may not last: "We see this sudden turn-around as similar to that during Q4 2012, when the multi-quarter deceleration trend reversed shortly after the policy stance shifted to ìcautiousî easing. But, that growth pick-up did not last for more than one quarter. Given the on-going deleveraging of the shadow banking system and potential headwind from the external situation as a result of potential QE tapering, we caution that this uptick may not last either."
We have just received a very pleasant Eurozone Flash PMI report, with numbers that definitely help cement the idea that the Eurozone is picking up speed. Here are a few key charts and tables from the report. Markit Markit Markit The nice upward swooping green line in the above chart signaling the recovery outside of France and Germany is very nice to see.

Ok, here's some good news for Europe. German Flash PMI ‚Äî which is an initial composite economic reading that combines a flash manufacturing survey with a flash services survey ‚Äî¬† just beat expectations on both sides. Here's the full summary from Markit: Markit This comes after a weakish French Flash PMI, so this strength is a relief (and it's causing the euro to hit a session high on the news). One of the biggest stories in the economy is the exit from recession in Europe, and this strong German number helps confirm that. Interestingly, this comes after a very strong Chinese Flash PMI number, so suddenly you have two of the world's most important manufacturing (and just generally economic) powerhouses posting surprisingly good data. Maybe the world is improving?
The biggest stories this week: Ugliness in emerging market currencies and the crash in Indonesia. Let's start with Indonesia, where the Jakarta market is over over 2.1%. It had tanked about 5% both Monday and Tuesday, before rallying back just slightly yesterday. Now it's diving again. It's experiencing the crumbling current account deficit (bad trade, investment money fleeing the scene) that's going on in a lot of emerging markets right now, and both its equity and currency are feeling the pain. Turning to the currency world, we're seeing the same stories we've seen all week for emerging market currencies. Here's a one-week look at the dollar vs. India's rupee.
