AP ImagesMiss Connecticut Erin Brady, who is originally from East Hampton and works in the financial services industry, was crowned Miss USA 2013 on Sunday night. According to her bio on theÂ Miss Connecticut website, she works as a Senior Accountant with Prudential Financial. Â  Brady beat out 50 other gorgeous women competing for the title at the Planet Hollywood Resort &amp; Casino in Las Vegas. Â The pageant is co-owned by NBC and Donald Trump.Â  For the opening number, Brady grabbed the audience's attention on the catwalk in a fun and bright green dress. For the evening gown portion of the competition, she took the stage in a stunning and sophisticated white gown with glittering gold bodice and train. Â  During the question part of the competition, she was asked if she agreed or disagreed with a Supreme Court ruling that criminal suspects could be subjected to a DNA test and to explain why or why not. "I would agree this," she responded. "I think if somebody's being prosecuted and they committed a crime that's that severe then they should have a DNA test. I think that there are so many crimes going on in this world that if that's one step closer to figuring out who's done it, I think we absolutely should do so."Â  She graduated from Central Connecticut State University.
REUTERS/Lucas JacksonThis week, the Federal Reserve will be holding its regular Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting where it will update the world on the direction of its ultra-easy monetary policy. This is without question the marquee event of the week, and the whole world will be watching. After the meeting, the Fed will release its FOMC statement which will be followed by its updated economic forecasts. And that will be followed by a press conference with Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke. Lately, investors have been speculating that the Fed could soon begin tightening its monetary policy, first by tapering its current bond-buying program. Some believe this is behind volatility in the markets where stocks have fallen, U.S. interest rates have rallied, and emerging market bonds have crumbled. Traders and investors around the world will watch the Fed very closely and scrutinize every breath for clues as to, if and when, the Fed is considering tightening monetary policy. Top Stories Economic Calendar Market Commentary There seems to be little consensus on what'll happen to stocks from now to the end of the year. But longer-term, the consensus seems to be that stocks will be heading up. Deutsche Bank's David Bianco recently said he expects the S&amp;P 500 to hit 2,000 by 2015. "Reduced recession risks and S&amp;P EPS grinding higher despite macro challenges has increased investor confidence in EPS sustainability and shifted the debate from normalized EPS to normalized long-term interest rates," he said. "Interest rates staying lower than history, even after the Fed stops purchases, as moderate growth persists making for an extended cycle, should drive the PE higher." In other words, all of this talk of tapering and tighter monetary policy may cause short-term volatility, but in the long-run it won't slam stocks.
Wikimedia CommonsMarkets are open in Asia, and things are starting off calmly. Korea's Kospi is up modestly. Japan's Nikkei is down 0.8%.Â  While this looks like a big number, the degree of volatility is much lower than we've scene in recent trading sessions. The big event this week is the Federal Reserve's FOMC meeting where Chairman Ben Bernanke will update the world on monetary policy. Global markets have been struggling to price in the prospect of tapering, or the reduction of the Fed's bond buying plan.Â  Stocks have trended lower, while interest rates have risen. "We do not expect Mr. Bernanke to yet show confidence that the time to taper QE is near, but the most important aspect of his media Q&amp;A will be whether he signals that an H2 taper remains plausible," said Deutsche Bank's Carl Riccadonna. U.S. futures are trading modestly higher.
REUTERS/Gary CameronOn Wednesday we get the latest policy announcement out of the Federal Reserve. Unlike some recent meetings, this is going to be a pretty important meeting. That's for two reasons: One is that interest rates are on the rise. The other is that people are really talking about the Fed slowing down on its extraordinary measures to stimulate the economy ("the taper" in popular parlance). Fortunately, Jon Hilsenrath of the WSJ has provided a blueprint for what to look for at Wednesday's meeting. Contrary to what you might expect, the most important part of the meeting is not going to be Bernanke's press conference on Wednesday after the announcement. Instead, says Hilsenrath, the key thing to watch is the Fed's forecast of the path of the economy. At the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, the Fed will release its updated projections of growth, inflation and unemployment. The evolution of these forecasts is a critical issue. Fed officials are unlikely at this meeting to change their $85-billion-per-month bond-buying program—launched to boost growth by pushing down long-term interest rates and pushing up asset prices, and spurring spending, hiring and investment. But what they say about the economy will send important signals about what they expect to do in the future. If they maintain confidence in their economic forecasts, it could signal they think they're on track to begin pulling back the program later this year. Mike O'Rourke of JonesTrading explains why Hilsenrath is likely spot-on in his assessment:  We think this article is extremely important and provides a clear path to the correct interpretation of the FOMC’s view.  The key takeaway will be to focus on whether the Fed maintains the forecast released in the March Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) when the June SEP is released.  The reason that we have a high degree of confidence in the Hilsenrath article is that nearly identical sentiments were expressed by another important Fed watcher, Greg Ip of The Economist in a CNBC interview.  Many will remember that Ip was Hilsenrath’s predecessor as the Fed watcher at the WSJ.     The title of the Hilsenrath article puts the focus on the Fed’s latest growth view.  The basic view Hilsenrath expressed is that “Fed officials are unlikely at this meeting to change their $85-billion-per-month bond-buying program—launched to boost growth by pushing down long-term interest rates and pushing up asset prices, and spurring spending, hiring and investment.” The basic view Greg Ip proffered on Friday was that “If the Economy continues to perform reasonably well, then they could start to step down the pace of Quantitative easing in the next few meetings. What he will not tell us, is which meeting or by how much.” All that being said, the language Bernanke uses in his post-meeting press conference will be interesting. George Goncalves, interest rate strategist at Nomura, thinks Bernanke will use this opportunity to clarify some communication hiccups that the Fed has been having: Thus the key event this week is the June FOMC meeting. If they strike the right tone, in our opinion, that should help keep the bullish price-action intact. We believe a Bernanke led FOMC will take this opportunity to make a clear distinction between tapering QE programs versus its commitment to keep Fed Funds rate “lower for longer”. A combination of Bernanke<U+201F>s Q&amp;A, an updated SEP forecast (where fed hike expectations can shift to out years) and a clear statement that codifies policy differences while flagging concerns over inflation would set the record straight.

It's supposed to be a poster child for everything that's wrong in Europe: high taxes, massive red tape, suffocating under cultural protectionism, and so forth. But maybe the country gets a bad rap. In her latest weekly note, SocGen's Michala Marcusen lists seven things that are actually going pretty well for France. We list them and summarize: So there you go, seven great things about France.
China's shadow banking system is out of control and under mounting stress as borrowers struggle to roll over short-term debts, Fitch Ratings has warned. The agency said the scale of credit was so extreme that the country would find it very hard to grow its way out of the excesses as in past episodes, implying tougher times ahead. "The credit-driven growth model is clearly falling apart. This could feed into a massive over-capacity problem, and potentially into a Japanese-style deflation," said Charlene Chu, the agency's senior director in Beijing. "There is no transparency in the shadow banking system, and systemic risk is rising. We have no idea who the borrowers are, who the lenders are, and what the quality of assets is, and this undermines signaling," she told The Daily Telegraph. While the non-performing loan rate of the banks may look benign at just 1pc, this has become irrelevant as trusts, wealth-management funds, offshore vehicles and other forms of irregular lending make up over half of all new credit. "It means nothing if you can off-load any bad asset you want. A lot of the banking exposure to property is not booked as property," she said. Concerns are rising after a string of upsets in Quingdao, Ordos, Jilin and elsewhere, in so-called trust products, a $1.4 trillion (£0.9 trillion) segment of the shadow banking system. Bank Everbright defaulted on an interbank loan 10 days ago amid wild spikes in short-term "Shibor" borrowing rates, a sign that liquidity has suddenly dried up. "Typically stress starts in the periphery and moves to the core, and that is what we are already seeing with defaults in trust products," she said. Fitch warned that wealth products worth $2 trillion of lending are in reality a "hidden second balance sheet" for banks, allowing them to circumvent loan curbs and dodge efforts by regulators to halt the excesses. This niche is the epicentre of risk. Half the loans must be rolled over every three months, and another 25pc in less than six months. This has echoes of Northern Rock, Lehman Brothers and others that came to grief in the West on short-term liabilities when the wholesale capital markets froze. Mrs Chu said the banks had been forced to park over $3 trillion in reserves at the central bank, giving them a "massive savings account that can be drawn down" in a crisis, but this may not be enough to avert trouble given the sheer scale of the lending boom. Overall credit has jumped from $9 trillion to $23 trillion since the Lehman crisis. "They have replicated the entire US commercial banking system in five years," she said. The ratio of credit to GDP has jumped by 75 percentage points to 200pc of GDP, compared to roughly 40 points in the US over five years leading up to the subprime bubble, or in Japan before the Nikkei bubble burst in 1990. "This is beyond anything we have ever seen before in a large economy. We don't know how this will play out. The next six months will be crucial," she said. The agency downgraded China's long-term currency rating to AA- debt in April but still thinks the government can handle any banking crisis, however bad. "The Chinese state has a lot of firepower. It is very able and very willing to support the banking sector. The real question is what this means for growth, and therefore for social and political risk," said Mrs Chu. "There is no way they can grow out of their asset problems as they did in the past. We think this will be very different from the banking crisis in the late 1990s. With credit at 200pc of GDP, the numerator is growing twice as fast as the denominator. You can't grow out of that." The authorities have been trying to manage a soft-landing, deploying loan curbs and a high reserve ratio requirement (RRR) for banks to halt property speculation. The home price to income ratio has reached 16 to 18 in many cities, shutting workers out of the market. Shadow banking has plugged the gap for much of the last two years. However, a new problem has emerged as the economic efficiency of credit collapses. The extra GDP growth generated by each extra yuan of loans has dropped from 0.85 to 0.15 over the last four years, a sign of exhaustion. Wei Yao from Societe Generale says the debt service ratio of Chinese companies has reached 30pc of GDP – the typical threshold for financial crises -- and many will not be able to pay interest or repay principal. She warned that the country could be on the verge of a "Minsky Moment", when the debt pyramid collapses under its own weight. "The debt snowball is getting bigger and bigger, without contributing to real activity," she said. The latest twist is sudden stress in the overnight lending markets. "We believe the series of policy tightening measures in the past three months have reached critical mass, such that deleveraging in the banking sector is happening. Liquidity tightening can be very damaging to a highly leveraged economy," said Zhiwei Zhang from Nomura. "There is room to cut interest rates and the reserve ratio in the second half," wrote a front-page editorial today in China Securities Journal on Friday. The article is the first sign that the authorities are preparing to change tack, shifting to a looser stance after a drizzle of bad data over recent weeks. The journal said total credit in China's financial system may be as high as 221pc of GDP, jumping almost eightfold over the last decade, and warned that companies will have to fork out $1 trillion in interest payments alone this year. "Chinese corporate debt burdens are much higher than those of other economies. Much of the liquidity is being used to repay debt and not to finance output," it said. It also flagged worries over an exodus of hot money once the US Federal Reserve starts tightening. "China will face large-scale capital outflows if there is an exit from quantitative easing and the dollar strengthens," it wrote. The journal said foreign withdrawals from Chinese equity funds were the highest since early 2008 in the week up to June 5, and withdrawals from Hong Kong funds were the most in a decade. 
PolytechnicPaul Soros passed away earlier this week at the age of 87 at his home in Manhattan. To some, he was known for having a wealthy baby brother named George. But Paul was no slouch,  having become one of the most influential shipping industry engineers of the second half of the 20th century. According to The New York Times' Robert D. Hershey Jr. wrote in the paper's obituary, Soros and his company Soros Associates (now a unit of KBR) run projects in 90 countries and have their fingerprints on seven of the world's 10-largest bulk ports in the world for bauxite, alumina, coal, and iron ore. Soros' breakthrough was allowing tankers to unload on the open sea using buoys. Waves had always made it difficult to build fixed piers outside of conventional, protected harbors. The buoys eliminated the need to do so.  The concept is still in use today. Here's a contemporary version, designed by Seabulk Inc.: Seabulk  Soros' other great achievement came in Brazil.  In the mid-'70s, according to a feature on Soros in NYU's Polytechnic alumni magazine, Brazil's national mining company (CVRD) signed up Soros to expand annual capacity at the iron port in Tubarao to 24 million tons from 14 million. Soros went one step further: he bet he could turn Brazil into the world's largest iron-ore producer if he could figure out a cheaper way to ship to Japan, then the world's largest importer. He ended up reconfiguring his offshore design such that the port could process more than 80 million tons — a 5x increase from Brazil's design. He then proposed a new method and itinerary to ship the material: pack the iron ore into 250,000 dead weight-ton ore-bulk-oil tankers — larger than the 100,000 exclusively ore carriers — and then, to make the trip efficient, tack on a second leg carrying Persian Gulf oil to Rotterdam. It worked, and for a time Brazil indeed held the title of world's largest producer.
As discussed in theÂ previous post, outflows from fixed income funds have been quite severe.  However in spite of the various forecasts,Â the so-called "Great Rotation"Â out of bonds and into equities (see CNBC story from May) has not materialized.  In fact just as investors put money into both bonds and stocks at the beginning of the year, more recently they have been exiting both asset classes concurrently. Investment Company Institute/Sober Look The only markets that have been spared the selloff are short-term fixed income instruments (money markets) such as treasury bills. Bill rates remain near the lowest levels of the year as institutional investors who have reduced their fixed income and equity exposure, moved into the short end of the treasury curve (see discussion). Â Sober Look Furthermore, as institutional investors bought treasury bills, retail investors moved into their brokerage money market accounts. Retail money market funds' assets have risen sharply. Investment Company Institute/Sober LookRetail money market funds total assets Â  It may be a disappointment to some forecasters, but the only "great rotation" taking place recently has been out of both fixed income and equities and into money markets and other cash instruments.
AP / Lefteris PitarakisThe veteran BBC broadcaster Malcolm Brabant with his wife, Trine Villemann, in London. Brabant suffered a complete mental breakdown which he blames on a yellow-fever immunisation.My friend Malcolm Brabant has gone to places none of us would like to go. He has been possessed sitting on his veranda under a dark, Attic sky; he has heard voices in his head that have urged him to kill; he has been drunk with delirium, believing he was the chosen one, the Messiah come to save the world. He has grappled with inner demons, devilish thoughts that have made him believe he was Lucifer, too. For almost two years, my friend Malcolm has slipped in and out of madness, dancing on the edge of an abyss most of us will never know. Spirits he calls guardian angels â€“ friends and relatives who died prematurely â€“ have sometimes accompanied him along the way. They have spoken to him in commandments, urging him to drink his urine or eat his excrement â€“ or brush his teeth with a lavatory brush. And, like those satanic thoughts, they have inhabited his soul. My friend Malcolm, a spirited man in his 50s, conquered by furies; an award-winning BBC foreign correspondent and storyteller par excellence who should never have been narrating this particular tale. "There is a very fine dividing line between madness and sanity," he says. "I have slipped between the two very easily. It is extraordinary, really, how rapidly it can happen." I had not heard his voice since he left Athens in October 2011. The departure had been "hasty", a shocking end to an illustrious career covering the killing fields that were the Balkans and the savagery of Chechnya before setting up in Miami and returning to Greece for a second stint in 2003. For years, Malcolm's was the familiar face that we saw on our screens reporting from all those spots. Like so many BBC veterans polished in the school of pitch and pace, his voice remains confident and strong. But as he speaks from his new home in Copenhagen, it is imbued with something else. "The doctors say there is a good chance I will fully recover, but there is also a chance I could relapse, too." "Relapse", a word I would never have associated with bold, brave, get-on-and do-it Malcolm. "I'm still on drugs, antipsychotic medication, even if it has been much reduced." It all began, Malcolm believes, with a pinprick â€“ a yellow-fever jab administered for a trip to the Ivory Coast. Well before most, Malcolm had become a one-man band, self-taught in the art of making films, creating packages and doing lives. But his choice to be based in Athens also came with its challenges. In a country long perceived to be a non-news maker â€“ before its dramatic economic collapse â€“ editorial indifference meant life as a freelance was marked by periods of feast and famine. There was no fixed salary or paid holidays. Enterprising freelances survived by broadening their skills and rooting for stories elsewhere. In the early spring of 2011, Malcolm was doing just that when he elected to go to the Ivory Coast on a non-BBC assignment to make a film for Unicef. The vaccine, a dose of Stamaril, administered at a municipal clinic in Athens, was part of his preparations for that trip. It was Friday 15 April 2011. Pressed for time, Malcolm stopped at the clinic while doing the school run with Trine, his Danish wife. "She asked: 'Shall I come in with you?' and I said, 'No.' It was routine. And there seemed nothing wrong with the clinic," he recalled. Within hours, the symptoms erupted. Gripped by a raging fever, he turned lobster red, shivering so violently the headboard above the couple's bed shook uncontrollably. It took two weeks â€“ after admission to hospital and a dose of steroids â€“ before his temperature could be brought down. Then came psychosis. A shooting star, glimpsed after supper from the balcony of their home, quickly convinced Malcolm that he had witnessed the Second Coming and, as such, had been invested with all the powers of a modern-day Messiah. Trine, by turns, suddenly found herself confronting a man she did not know. One minute he was Baby Jesus â€“ demanding he be swaddled in a sheet â€“ the next he was ranting incoherently or daubing crosses on the walls of their home with the juice of crushed strawberries. Often, the couple's son, Lukas, would witness his father consumed by fury and despair. "He was an innocent 12-year-old boy who should never have seen such things," says Malcolm. "He is as much a victim as me." Incarceration began in Athens with Malcolm spending his first three weeks in a psychiatric hospital on the outskirts of the capital. But there was worse to come. And when it did, it came in the form of Lucifer himself. Unable to keep up his job in Athens â€“ following a bout of treatment in his native Ipswich â€“ it was decided that the couple should retreat to Copenhagen. "What happened in the Greek hospital was completely mild to what happened here," says Malcolm. "We left in a hurry, a real hurry, and in November, soon after we got here, I just collapsed. It was as if I had been stabbed in the lungs and all the air had been taken out of me. I was convinced I was the devil and that my actions would lead to both Trine and Lukas being killed." There was no option but to be committed, this time to a psychiatric hospital on the outskirts of Copenhagen. "It was a locked-in ward known as 811. I spent seven days rocking back and forth saying I was the devil," he remembers. "I grew a long, spikey beard and just rocked and rocked." Forced to endure the "guttural screams and shrieks of other patients" and not speaking a word of Danish, Malcolm thought he was experiencing hell on earth. For Trine, whose father had been incarcerated in the same ward before taking his own life 20 years earlier, it was hard beyond words. Imagining himself, in his first bout of madness, to be the Messiah was one thing. "But to believe I was the instrument of the devil, to be consumed by such dark thoughts, was quite another." Dogged by depression, his life in complete ruins, Malcolm underwent four sessions of electroconvulsive therapy which, initially at least, spurred the couple into thinking he was on the way to recovery. "On Christmas Eve I was allowed back home for three hours. Trine had cooked a wonderful meal, but as I was standing in the kitchen, carving the meat, a 10-inch blade in my hand, all I kept hearing were these voices saying 'kill', 'kill', 'kill', and they were incredibly loud. I was like a camera outside myself â€¦ my conscious and corporeal being were never going to give into them, but I was really very shocked." Was he a schizophrenic or a potential psychopath? Both thoughts raced through his mind. On New Year's Eve, utterly persuaded he would kill his wife and son, he placed a belt around his neck and tried to take his own life, instead. A nurse caught him, just in time. In July last year, Malcolm was let out of the hospital. He has not been readmitted. But what he regards as a fluke of fate has destroyed his life. His job, his beloved Greece have both been lost. And, in being taken to places no one would want to go, he has been brought to the brink of penury. The couple do not doubt that the yellow fever vaccine is to blame. "From when the fever first started, it was clear that Malcolm was having an adverse event," insists Trine, a journalist herself. "All the experts I have spoken to believe the batch was contaminated." Steadfastly they have pursued the manufacturer, Sanofi Pasteur, for compensation. The company has vehemently denied any link, arguing that the batch of vaccine in question had "passed the numerous quality controls" and suggesting that perhaps Malcolm's breakdown was the result of being predisposed to mental illness. Although the company admits that reports of side-effects have included mental disorders, it says there have been fewer than 10 such reports, including Malcolm's, after the distribution of more than 300 million doses of the vaccine worldwide. Out of the darkness, scrambling for light, Malcolm has written eloquently, in his book, Malcolm is a Little Unwell, about his descent into madness. It was, as I have said, the story he was never meant to tell. But as a friend, I can only thank the gods that he is here to tell it.

The economic data have improved a bit since the last FOMC meeting ... But the improvement has been far from “substantial.” Growth remains in the sluggish 1-3% range ... and jobs gains remain moderate. Inflation, meanwhile, has continued to fall further below the FOMC’s 2% PCE target. ... Financial conditions have tightened since the last FOMC meeting, as bond yields have risen, mortgage and credit spreads have widened ... The tightening in financial conditions appears in large part driven by worries that Fed officials will soon tighten policy. ... While we do not expect the committee to deviate much from the existing message, we anticipate that Fed officials will, on the margin, try to calm markets at the June 18-19 FOMC meeting. We therefore expect the FOMC statement to show only modest changes, mostly focused on acknowledging the lower inflation numbers. Moreover, the committee is likely to downgrade its 2013 growth and inflation numbers moderately. While Chairman Bernanke is likely to reiterate in the post-statement press conference that the QE tapering decision is data dependent, we expect him to dissuade markets from frontloading too much of the entire monetary tightening process—not just the end of QE but also the normalization of the funds rate—as soon as the committee takes the first step in that direction. The FOMC meeting is on Tuesday and Wednesday, with the FOMC statement and projections scheduled for release at 2 PM ET on Wednesday. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke will hold a press conference at 2:30 PM. I'll post a preview on Sunday, but I don't expect any changes to policy.
Economists Are (Still) Clueless The Revenge of the Minsky Moment Monaco, Cyprus, Croatia, Switzerland, and Las Vegas Economists set themselves too easy, too useless a task if in tempestuous seasons they can only tell us that when the storm is past the ocean is flat again. - John Maynard Keynes, A Tract on Monetary Reform There can be few fields of human endeavor in which history counts for so little as in the world of finance. Past experience, to the extent that it is part of memory at all, is dismissed as the primitive refuge of those who do not have insight to appreciate the incredible wonders of the present. - John Kenneth Galbraith Hitler must have been rather loosely educated, not having learned the lesson of Napoleon's autumn advance on Moscow. - Sir Winston Churchill US GDP has been slowly ramping up, only to fall back and then try once more to bring us back to the '90s. Stocks markets are volatile but seemingly moving higher in most of the developed world, except for Japan, where the current 20% drop comes hard on the heels of one of their frequent "end of the bear market forever" rallies of almost 90% â€“ how many of those have we seen over the last 24 years? Europe is mostly in recession or Muddling Through with very slow growth. I continue to read from those who know China intimately that there is a real crisis brewing there. And over the last four weeks I have highlighted how desperate the situation is in Japan. The main obsession in the US seems to be whether and when the Fed may stop its current round of massive QE. Every hint of "tapering" spurs volatility in the markets. If you are a forex (foreign exchange) trader, you are left breathless at the recent moves, sometimes a whole order of magnitude (10 times) larger than average. Get used to it: currency wars are likely to be a feature of the landscape for the rest of this decade. (My friend Mohamed El-Erian, CEO of PIMCO, corrected me on stage recently, telling me the polite term du jour is "currency tensions." And compared to what I think is coming, we really are just in the tension phase. Later we will get to skirmishes and then full-fledged currency combat.) At the same time, there are some things to be sanguine about, at least in the US. Corporate profits are at all-time highs. The housing market is finally doing well in most parts of the country, adding jobs and boosting GDP. We continue to find more oil and gas seemingly everywhere we look. There are no political races this summer to spoil the mood, since it's too early to for anyone to seriously run for president in 2016. The economic forecasts of mainstream economists are quite positive, if not entirely optimistic, reflecting the current data. Should we not take heart from that? Alas, no. I have been working the last few months with my co-author of Endgame, Jonathan Tepper, on a longer paperÂ  in which we discuss the economic affairs of the world. One of our pet amusements is to research just how bad economists really are at forecasting. (Of course, we ourselves get branded with that economist label from time to time, although most serious economists would rather not be associated with us.) This week we look at some of our recent musings on that topic, triggered by a letter from a very serious economist who took umbrage when I wrote disparagingly about economists and forecasting a couple months ago. But first, I announced last week that the initial group of videos from the 2013 Strategic Investment Conference is available. Well, now the final group of conference videos has also been uploaded. These videos feature some incredible speakers, including Nouriel Roubini, Charles Gave, Ian Bremmer, and my humble self.

My Altegris partners and I have worked hard to enhance the Mauldin Circle program, which provides exclusive access to alternative investment managers and other thought leaders.  Now, let's turn to that letter. Professor John Seater, a distinguished gentleman and economist from North Carolina State University, disagreed with my dismal view of economists and forecasting a couple of months back ("Assume a Perfect World"). I actually do read the comments to my letters (I learn a lot), and I understood his irritation. I went to his website (I find an amazing number of my readers can be found writing in their own venues and often write intriguingly) and read some of his papers. I found myself really liking them, especially the one on the relationship between growth and regulation. I would highly recommend it to all the congressional staffers who read my letter (and I know there are a lot of you). And then show it to your bosses. Make them read it. (Warning: you may have to translate it for them. It is written in a subdialect of English called academic economics. I'm not perfectly fluent in it myself, but I can get most of it if I read slowly.) Here's a quick sample from the paper's introduction: We find that regulation added since 1949 has reduced the aggregate growth rate on average by about two percentage points over our sample period. As usual with the compound effect of growth rates, the accumulated effect ofÂ  a moderate change in the growth rate leads to large effects on the level over time. In particular, our estimates indicate that annual output by 2005 is about 28 percent of what it would have been had regulation remained at its 1949 level. (You can read the paper here, and the rest of his recent publications are here. I should actually do a shorter letter on the regulation and growth topic, or even better, get the professor to write one.) As a professor of economics (macroeconomics at that), I find this article multiply irritating. First, about forecasting. It is always easy to poke fun at economic forecasts, especially because they usually turn out to be wrong, often by a large margin. However, before laughing them off, think about what is being asked of those forecasts and the economists making them by considering the following analogy. I presume that most of you reading this own a car and have a license to drive it. The license certifies you to be minimally competent drivers, sort of the way a Ph.D. certifies an economist to have a minimal command of economics. Nonetheless, it is very easy to prove that you are all incompetent fools who know nothing about how a car works or how to drive it and thus to prove that drivers' licenses are a big joke. Answer the following simple question: What will be the Mercator grid coordinates of your car exactly 2,190 hours from now (that's three months), what direction will it be traveling, and how fast will it be going? You obviously don't know. I have just proven that you are an incompetent driver and a fool deserving of ridicule because you claim to know the basics of how a car works and how it is to be used. Asking an economist to predict where GDP (a far, far more complicated object than any automobile) will be in 3 months or a year and then ridiculing him for getting it wrong is exactly the same. An economist can tell you a lot about what makes GDP move around. Asking him to predict where GDP will be some months in the future, what direction it will be going, and how fast it will be going that way is very different. It is asking for an unconditional forecast without providing any information about what the driver (the American people and their government) wants to do, whether he will step on the brake or the accelerator, whether he will have the gears in forward or reverse, and so on. Of course economists get it wrong, and often wildly so, just the way you can't answer my question about your car. Actually, professor, it is not the same. If I make a decision to do so, I can tell you with pretty good precision where my car will be in three months and at what speed it will be traveling. I can also give you a 98% probability of where I will be on Christmas Day, 2013. But we do not ask economists to forecast the precise location of the economy a year hence. Just getting the direction (north or south?) right would be a good start. The problem is that economists take these predictions so seriously, and so do politicians and investors. I think you might agree that the statistical probability that we will not have a recession in the US for the rest of the decade is quite low, yet not one budget projection assumes a slowdown, let alone a recession, which would absolutely devastate any budget as far as deficits are concerned. We act as if the business cycle has been repealed by an act of Congress. I understand why we do forecasts. As humans, citizens, politicians, businessmen, and investors, we have to plan. I am guilty of making forecasts myself. However, if we do not want to be judged on our forecasting abilities, then we should not prognosticate, at least not in public. And we certainly shouldn't make our predictions sound so certain to the general public. And with that as a set-up (and with apologies to the professor, who went on to list other irritating points in my April 13 letter), let's turn to a relevant excerpt from the paper that Jonathan Tepper and I are working on. Economists Are (Still) Clueless In November of 2008, as stock markets crashed around the world, the Queen of England visited the London School of Economics to open the New Academic Building. While she was there, she listened in on academic lectures. The Queen, who studiously avoids controversy and almost never lets people know what she's actually thinking, finally asked a simple question about the financial crisis: "How come nobody could foresee it?" No one could answer her. If you've suspected all along that economists are useless at the job of forecasting, you would be right. Dozens of studies show that economists are completely incapable of forecasting recessions. But forget forecasting. What's worse is that they fail miserably even at understanding where the economy is today. In one of the broadest studies of whether economists can predict recessions and financial crises, Prakash Loungani of the International Monetary Fund wrote very starkly, "The record of failure to predict recessions is virtually unblemished." He found this to be true not only for official organizations like the IMF, the World Bank, and government agencies but for private forecasters as well. They're all terrible. Loungani concluded that the "inability to predict recessions is a ubiquitous feature of growth forecasts." Most economists were not even able to recognize recessions once they had already started. In plain English, economists don't have a clue about the future. If you think the Fed or government agencies know what is going on with the economy, you're mistaken. Government economists are about as useful as a screen door on a submarine. Their mistakes and failures are so spectacular you couldn't make them up if you tried. Yet now, in a post-crisis world, we trust the same people to know where the economy is, where it is going, and how to manage monetary policy. Central banks say they will know the right time to end the current policies of quantitative easing and financial repression and when to shrink the bloated monetary base. However, given their record at forecasting, how will they know? The Federal Reserve not only failed to predict the recessions of 1990, 2001, and 2007, it also didn't even recognize them after they had already begun. Financial crises frequently happen because central banks cut interest rates too late and hike rates too soon. Trusting central bankers now is a big bet that (1) they'll know what to do, (2) they'll know when to do it. Sadly, given the track record, that is not a good wager. Unfortunately, the problem is not that economists are simply bad at what they do; it's that they're really, really bad. They're so bad that it cannot even be a matter of chance. The statistician Nate Silver points this out in his book The Signal and the Noise: Indeed, economists have for a long time been much too confident in their ability to predict the direction of the economy. If economists' forecasts were as accurate as they claimed, we'd expect the actual value for GDP to fall within their prediction interval nine times out of ten, or all but about twice in eighteen years. In fact, the actual value for GDP fell outside the economists' prediction interval six times in eighteen years, or fully one-third of the time. Another study, which ran these numbers back to the beginning of the Survey of Professional Forecasters in 1968, found even worse results: the actual figure for GDP fell outside the prediction interval almost half the time. There is almost no chance that economists have simply been unlucky; they fundamentally overstate the reliability of their predictions. So economists are not only generally wrong, they're overly confident in their bad forecasts. If economists were merely wrong at betting on horse races, their failure would be amusing. But central bankers have the power to create money, change interest rates, and affect our lives in multiple ways â€“ and they don't have a clue. Despite this, they remain perennially confident. There's no overestimating the hubris of central bankers. On 60 Minutes in December, 2010, Scott Pelley interviewed Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and asked him whether he would be able to do the right thing at the right time. The exchange was startling (at least to us): Pelley: Can you act quickly enough to prevent inflation from getting out of control? Bernanke: We could raise interest rates in 15 minutes if we have to. So, there really is no problem with raising rates, tightening monetary policy, slowing the economy, reducing inflation, at the appropriate time. Now, that time is not now. Pelley: You have what degree of confidence in your ability to control this? Bernanke: One hundred percent. There you have it. Bernanke was not 95% confident, he was not 99% confident â€“ no, he had zero doubts about his ability to know what is going on in the economy and what to do about it. We would love to have that sort of certainty about anything in life. We're not just picking on Bernanke; we're picking on all central bankers who think they're infallible. The Bank of England has had by far the largest QE program relative to the size of its economy (though the Bank of Japan is about to show it a thing or two). It also has the worst forecasting track record of any bank, and the worst record on inflation. Sir Mervyn King, the head of the Bank of England, was asked if it would be difficult to withdraw QE. He very confidently replied, "I have absolutely no doubt that when the time comes for us to reduce the size of our balance sheet that we'll find that a whole lot easier than we did when expanding it."Â  (Are central bankers just naturally more overconfident than regular human beings, or are they smoking some powerful stuff at their meetings?) Let's see whether this sort of absolute certainty is in any way warranted. In his book Future Babble, Dan Gardner writes that economists are treated with the reverence the ancient Greeks bestowed on the Oracle of Delphi. But unlike the vague pronouncements from Delphi, economists' predictions can be checked against the future, and as Gardner says, "Anyone who does that will quickly conclude that economists make lousy soothsayers." The nearsightedness of economists is nothing new. In 1994 Paul Ormerod wrote a book called The Death of Economics. He pointed to economists' failure to forecast the Japanese recession after their bubble burst in 1989 or to foresee the collapse of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism in 1992. Ormerod was scathing in his assessment of economists: "The ability of orthodox economics to understand the workings of the economy at the overall level is manifestly weak (some would say it was entirely non-existent)." When most people think of economic forecasts, they almost always think of recessions, while economists think of forecasting growth rates or interest rates. But the average man in the street only wants to know, "Will we be in a recession soon?" And if the economy is actually in a recession he wants to know, "When will it end?" The reason he cares is that he knows recessions mean job cuts and firings. Recessions lead to falls in GDP and spikes in the unemployment rate:  Unfortunately, economists are of little use to the man in the street. If you look at the history of the last three recessions in the United States, you will see that the inability of economists and central bankers to understand the state of the economy was so bad that you might be tempted to say they couldn't find their derrieres with both hands. Economists have yet to correctly call a recession:  Let's remind ourselves what a recession is and how economists decide that one has started. A recession is a downturn in economic activity. Normally, a recession means unemployment goes up, GDP contracts, stock prices fall, and the economy weakens. The lofty body that decides when a recession has started or ended is the Business Cycle Dating Committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research. It is packed with eminent economists â€“ all extremely smart people. Unfortunately, their pronouncements are completely unusable in real time. Their dating of recessions is authoritative and more or less accurate, but this exercise in hindsight comes long after a recession has started or ended. To give you an idea just how late recessions are officially called, let's look at the past three. The NBER dated the 1990-91 recession as beginning in August 1990 and ending in March 1991. It announced these facts in April 1991, by which time the recession was already over and the economy was growing again. The NBER was no faster at catching up with the recession that followed the dotcom bust. It wasn't until June 2003 that the NBER pinpointed the start of the 2001 recession â€“ a full 28 months after the recession ended. The NBER didn't date the recession that started in December 2007 until exactly one year later. By that time, Lehman had gone bust, and the world was engulfed in the biggest financial cataclysm since the Great Depression. The Federal Reserve and private economists also missed the onset of the last three US recessions â€“ even after they had started. Let's look quickly at each one. Starting with the 1990-91 recession, let's see what the head of the Federal Reserve â€“ the man who is charged with running American monetary policy â€“ was saying at the time. That recession started in August 1990, but one month before it began Alan Greenspan said, "In the very near term there's little evidence that I can see to suggest the economy is tilting over [into recession]." The following month â€“ the month the recession actually started â€“ he continued on the same theme: "... those who argue that we are already in a recession I think are reasonably certain to be wrong." He was just as clueless two months later, in October 1990, when he persisted, "... the economy has not yet slipped into recession." It was only near the end of the recession that Greenspan came around to accepting that it had begun. The Federal Reserve did no better in the dotcom bust. Let's look at the facts. The recession started in March 2001. The tech-heavy NASDAQ Index had already fallen 50% in a full-scale bust. Even so, Chairman Greenspan declared before the Economic Club of New York on May 24, 2001, "Moreover, with all our concerns about the next several quarters, there is still, in my judgment, ample evidence that we are experiencing only a pause in the investment in a broad set of innovations that has elevated the underlying growth rate in productivity to a level significantly above that of the two decades preceding 1995." Charles Morris, a retired banker and financial writer, looked at a decade's worth of forecasts by the professionals at the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, the crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me of academic economists. In 2000, the council raised their growth estimates just in time for the dot-com bust and the recession of 2001-02. And in a survey in March 2001, 95% of American economists said there would not be a recession. (John forecast it in September 2000 in this letter). The recession had already started that March, and the signs of contraction were evident. Industrial production had already been contracting for five months. You would have thought that failure to forecast two recessions in a row might have sharpened the wits of the Federal Reserve, the Council of Economic Advisers, and private economists. Maybe they would have tried to improve their methods or figured out why they had failed so miserably. You would be wrong. Because along came the Great Recession, and once again they completely missed the boat. The Revenge of the Minsky Moment Let's look at what the Fed was doing as the world was about to go up in flames in 2008. Recently, complete minutes of the Fed's October 2007 meeting were released. Keep in mind that the recession started two months later, in December. The word recession does not appear once in the entire transcript. It gets worse. The month the recession started, the Federal Reserve was all optimistic laughter. Dr. David Stockton, the Federal Reserve chief economist, presented his views to Chairman Bernanke and the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on December 11, 2007. When you read the following quote, remember that, at the time, the Fed was already providing ample liquidity to the shadow banking system after dozens of subprime lenders had gone bust in the spring, the British bank Northern Rock had been nationalized and had spooked the European banking system, dozens of money market funds had been shut due to toxic assets, credit spreads were widening, stock prices had started to fall, and almost all the classic signs of a recession were evident. These included an inverted yield curve, which had received the casual attention of New York Fed economists even as it screamed recession. (John had pointed to it numerous times here in Thoughts from the Frontline.) Read these words of the Fed's Chief Economist and weep. You can't make this stuff up: Overall, our forecast could admittedly be read as still painting a pretty benign picture: Despite all the financial turmoil, the economy avoids recession and, even with steeply higher prices for food and energy and a lower exchange value of the dollar, we achieve some modest edging-off of inflation. So I tried not to take it personally when I received a notice the other day that the Board had approved more frequent drug-testing for certain members of the senior staff, myself included. [Laughter] I can assure you, however, that the staff is not going to fall back on the increasingly popular celebrity excuse that we were under the influence of mind-altering chemicals and thus should not be held responsible for this forecast. No, we came up with this projection unimpaired and on nothing stronger than many late nights of diet Pepsi and vending-machine Twinkies. All other government economists were equally awful. The President's Council of Economic Advisers' 2008 forecast saw positive growth for the first half of the year and foresaw a strong recovery in the second half. Note the date on the cartoon below: May 28, 2008!  Unfortunately, private-sector economists didn't do much better. With very few exceptions, they failed to foresee the financial and economic meltdown of 2008. Economists polled in the Survey of Professional Forecasters also failed to see a recession developing. They forecasted a slightly below -average growth rate of 2.4 percent for 2008, and they thought there was almost no chance of a recession as severe as the one that actually unfolded. In December 2007 a Businessweek survey showed that every single one of 54 economists surveyed actually predicted that the US economy would avoid a recession in 2008. The experts were unanimous that unemployment wouldn't be a problem, leading to the consensus conclusion that 2008 would be a good year. As Nate Silver has pointed out, the worst thing about the bad predictions isn't that they were awful; it's that the economists in question were so confident in them. Now, this was a very bad forecast: far from growing by 2.4%, GDP actually shrank by 3.3% once the financial crisis hit. Yet these economists assigned only a 3% chance to the economy's shrinking by any margin at all over the whole of 2008, and they gave it only about a 1-in-500 chance of shrinking by 2 percent, as it did. It is one thing to be wrong; it is quite another to be consistently and confidently and egregiously wrong. As the global financial meltdown unfolded, Chairman Bernanke, too, continued to believe that the US would avoid a recession. Mind you, the recession had started in December 2007, yet in January '08 Bernanke told the press, "The Federal Reserve is not currently forecasting a recession." Even after banks like Bear Stearns needed to be rescued, Bernanke continued seeing rainbows and candy-colored elves ahead for the US economy. He declared on June 9, 2008, "The risk that the economy has entered a substantial downturn appears to have diminished over the past month or so." At that stage, the economy had already been in a recession for the past six months! Why do people listen to economists anymore? Scott Armstrong, an expert on forecasting at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, has developed a "seer-sucker" theory: "No matter how much evidence exists that seers do not exist, suckers will pay for the existence of seers." Even if experts fail repeatedly in their predictions, most people prefer to have seers, prophets, and gurus tell them something â€“ anything at all â€“ about the future. So, we have cataloged the incredible failures of economists to predict the future or even to understand the present. Now think of the vast powers Fed economists have to print money and move interest rates. When you contemplate the consummate skill that would actually be required to manage post-Great Recession policies, you realize they're really just flying blind. If that reality doesn't scare the living daylights out of you, you're not paying attention. The longer the Federal Reserve sticks to its current policy, the more likely that policy will end in tears. Call it the Revenge of the Minsky Moment. Monaco, Cyprus, Croatia, Switzerland, and Las Vegas I leave Sunday evening for Monaco to deliver a speech at GAIM. Then, after a weekend in France, where I will meet with a few friends and associates, I fly to Cyprus, where I have a very aggressive schedule of meetings with people who are dealing with their current crisis. That should make for an interesting letter as I report back to you. Then I take a ridiculously early flight to eventually wind up in Split, Croatia, to spend the weekend with David McWilliams and his family at his summer vacation home on an island off the coast. Finally, I'll make my way to Geneva before returning home. Then on July 6 and 7 I'll be in Las Vegas. Reid Walker, friend and recovering hedge fund manager based here in Dallas, is organizing an event during the World Series of Poker, on the theme of the intersection between investing and poker skills. This is just an entirely different world for me. I will not be entering the tournament â€“ I know my limitations! But talking to some of the best players in the world and meeting Nate Silver and some of the other speakers will make for a fun weekend. The event is not cheap, but you can get a 10% discount by putting in the code "Mauldin10". Let me know if you're coming, and we'll get together for a meal.

We have to think not just about what the latest technology is, but about what it might be in the next ten years, so we can wire for it now. It really costs a lot to go back and re-wire in a high rise after everything is done. And the choices are so varied. We are looking at a few designs and businesses that might help with them; but if you are an expert or know of one, I would appreciate a little input.

This is Father's Day weekend, and my kids are all going to be in one place for a day. I am really looking forward to that. Life goes by so fast. Tomorrow I will be going to see my mother, who will celebrate her 96th birthday in August. None of her ten brothers and sisters made it past 95, although almost all lived into their 90s, and Grandfather was 98 when he passed. Mother is getting visibly weaker, although she is mentally still quite active. And then I get to hang out with grandkids on Sunday.

24/7 Wall St.: - ... [US] manufacturing base still matters, as the United States remains one of the top exporters in the world. And a disturbing trend may be forming that signals some underlying weakness in the old core economy. This could be bad news for employment, growth, exports, revenue, capital spending and just about everything else. Industrial production came in flat for the month of May rather than a 0.2% expected gain. The reading on capacity utilization posted an unexpected drop to 77.6%, versus a Bloomberg expectation for a 0.1% gain to 77.9%. To make matters worse, the 77.8% from April was revised to 77.7%. The peak cycle was 78.3% in March, which makes things look even worse. Moreover, the long-term trend in capacity utilization in the US shows a secular decline. After each major recession over the past 50 years, capacity utilization peaked at a lower level than after the previous recession. So far in the post-Great Recession recovery, this trend has not been violated, as the nation struggles from chronic excess capacity. Sober Look
We had anticipated a better showing for the US dollar. Â Yet, indicators suggest we were early and that the near-term risk is still to the dollar's downside. Â  Of course, the key is how the market responds to the FOMC statement. Â We have consistently argued that the Fed is unlikely to taper as early many participants and observers have suggested: Â Not in June, the summer or September. Â Our base line view was for a tapering late this year, but see a strong case to be made for allowing the next Federal Reserve chairperson have the distinction; partly on economic grounds, and partly drawing insight from game theory. Â We recognize the desire to enhance the Fed's anti-inflation credentials after a prolonged period of unorthodox and extensive easing of policy. Both the Fed's "tapering" and ECB's "open mindedness" regarding a negative deposit rate were types of forward guidance, but now the rubber must meet the road, so to speak. Â Neither is inclined to follow through with what we have argued was a successful feint. Â In any event, we expect that the Fed's $85 bln a month in long-term asset purchases will continue unabated. Â And the ECB is likely to find in the flash PMIs more reason not to give up on their expectations for a gradual recovery going forward. Â  As the euro rose against dollar over the last few weeks, the premium the US offers on 2-year money has been more than halved.Â  In recent days this has begun recovering and is consistent with a softer euro. Â However, the price action itself remains constructive and the euro finished the week just above the retracement objective near $1.3340. Â  The RSI and MACDs are getting stretched, but have yet to turn. Â  Â  In addition, the lows from March and May in the $1.2750-$1.2800 area may be a double bottom. Â The neckline is near $1.3200. Â The minimum objective of the patter is $1.3650-$1.3700, which is near the year's highs. Â A move back below the $1.3200 area would negate the double bottom. Â Initial support is pegged in the $1.3260-80 band. Â Â  Arguably, the most striking thing about the yen's 8.1% rise against the dollar over the past month has been the incredible volatility. Â One-week implied vol reached 25% last week and the 3-month poked through 16% briefly. Â Both are two-year highs. Â  As with the euro, so too with the yen--we are seeing greater dollar weakness than we had anticipated. Â The charts do not suggest a turn is necessarily imminent, but rather that we are in the latter stages of the move. Â We had thought the JPY95 area, which has been our quarter-end forecast, would offer better support. Â The week's lows near JPY93.80 are set to be challenged at the start of the new week. Â Some Â some optionality and stops are thought to be near Â JPY93.50. Â  A break could spur a move toward JPY91.50. Â Â  A move now back above the JPY96.20 would suggest a low is in place. Â Perhaps, the performance of the Nikkei can be instructive. Â We might feel more comfortable with picking a bottom to the dollar against the yen if the Nikkei were to trade higher after giving up nearly 50% of the gains seen since mid-Nov 2012. Â  The broader dollar setback and favorable economic news from the UK has lifted sterling to 4-month highs. Â  As with the euro, sterling's technical studies are getting stretched, but no sign of an imminent top. Â Provided the $1.56 area holds, sterling can move test the $1.5800 area. Â  The dollar has a much deeper retracement of its gains against the Swiss franc in recent weeks. Â While the euro recovered a little more than 60% and sterling a bit more than 50%, Â the dollar has shed 80% of this year's gains against the Swiss franc. Â Given the current dynamics, it seems risk to pick a dollar bottom against the Swiss franc until one thinks the dollar is about to recover against the Japanese yen. Â A move above CHF0.9300-30 would be technically constructive. Â  While the dollar does not look to have quite bottomed yet against the majors, it can probably be better bid against the dollar-bloc. Â Near the pre-weekend low, the US dollar has returned nearly 50% of this year's gains against the Canadian dollar. Â The disappointing merchandise sales figures saw the US dollar recover. Â The data offers important insight into the Canadian economy and that insight is not particularly encouraging: Â New orders fell by nearly 1% and inventories rose. Â  The report points to a cooling of the industrial sector. Â Technically and on a risk-reward basis, the Canadian dollar looks interesting as a short leg of crosses or against the US dollar outright. Â The CAD1.0200-40 offers the first band of resistance.Â  In the second half of last week, the Australian and New Zealand dollars turned in better perfromances.Â Â This seemed to be more a question of short squeeze that has only marginally something do do with those countries per se and more to do with market positioning. Â That said, it is true that expectations for a July RBA rate cut have been scaled back. There are a certain number of generally agreed upon facts. Â First, the short-term speculative community has established a large short Australian dollar position. Â Second, the Aussie has fallen a long way in a relatively short period of time. Â  Third, sentiment remains bearish. Â Fourth, despite the depreciation, the central bank and private sector models still show the Aussie to be significantly over-valued. Â  Taken together, these mean that while the Australian dollar is susceptible to a short-squeeze, it probably is not carving out a significant low. Â It put in a 3 cent bounce from lows early last week to Friday's high. Â  The pre-weekend price action warns that that might be it. Â A break of $0.9500-20 area could signal the resumption of the downtrend. Â  The dollar also looks constructive against the Mexican peso, even though it made fresh two-week lows before the weekend. Â It did recover and technical support just below MXN12.60 held. Â We expect range players to look a return toward MXN12.85-90.Â  Observations on the speculative positioning in the CME currency futures: Â         Read more posts on Marc to Market Â»
In my first column a month ago, I raised the possibility that China’s softer growth might not be all bad for us here in the UK, as long as it is generally confined to their own production and is reflected in a period of softer commodity prices.If that’s the case, a number of commodity-importing countries, ourselves included, will not suffer the sorts of strains on disposable incomes that we have experienced in recent years. I had not previously considered that their softer growth might actually help us, having assumed stronger growth for them was better for all of us elsewhere in the world. Since then, the latest data releases in China for the month of May have been generally softer again, confirming that China is experiencing a period of weaker growth. It also looks as though their policymakers are broadly content with this. Importantly, while growth is softer, domestic consumer spending, at least as measured by their monthly retail sales, is holding up relative to their production. I see this as a broadly more reassuring picture for them, and therefore for the rest of us also. It is becoming more fashionable in financial circles to suggest that the great era of emerging market growth, and with it the case for investing in emerging markets, is at an end. It is true that more of the countries that have done so well in the past decade are showing signs of problems and are facing new challenges, but I suspect this is not something that can be simply generalised. More interesting is the fact that this broad story of softer growth in emerging markets is coinciding with increasing signs of better growth in the developed world, especially the UK, but I suspect that, beyond the indirect benefit of commodity prices, this is also a coincidence. In addition to China’s slowing - much of which has been deliberately engineered in favour of more balanced, higher-quality growth - each of the other BRIC countries is disappointing in 2013. India’s growth for the last financial year has been just over 5pc; Brazil is growing at less than half that; Russia is growing between 3pc and 4pc, but signs of underlying issues about the style of leadership increase. To this list, we can now add concerns about Turkey - “a BRIC in our neighbourhood”, as the Prime Minister accurately described the country during his first overseas trip - with Indonesia and Mexico also both slowing a little. That just leaves Nigeria and other parts of Africa as the champions of strong growth in the emerging world, or at least on the levels many have been hoping for. In the investing world, the emerging market bond story was one that captured investors’ imaginations more than the emerging market equity story, judging by the size of relative flows. Some of us worried that this relative asset judgment might not turn out to be much more than a leveraged play on the low interest rates and super-easy monetary policies of the US Federal Reserve. We feared that, once the Fed showed any signs of backing away from this, those bond markets might take some fright. Sure enough, in the past month, as markets have focused on the US economic releases and signs in Fed commentary about “tapering” - the easing of the pace of Fed liquidity additions - many emerging market bonds have suffered more than US bonds. This has echoes of 1994 and the only savage, near-12-month bear market of the past 30 years. Investors would be advised to think carefully about what really could happen when the Fed definitively steps off the gas. Which brings me back to the broader topic of emerging markets. Since I first invented the BRIC acronym nearly 12 years ago, I have always believed it is old-fashioned to think about the world as “developed” versus “emerging”. And it is just as inappropriate to think of all those countries that are outside the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development umbrella of “developed” (which, in fact, a number of emerging countries aren’t) as the same, or as facing the same issues. We have to think about these countries separately. What it probably does mean is that investors, especially less well-informed retail ones, should be careful about broad emerging market funds, and especially ones geared just to bonds. I also don’t think people should just blindly follow the GDP growth from any one of these countries, but should look instead at the quality and sustainability in terms of what they may offer - and, of course, the valuation implied at any one moment by their markets. In this regard, they almost definitely aren’t any different from the rest.
