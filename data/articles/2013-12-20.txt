Brett Bolkowy via www.flickr.com creative commons Silicon Valley has been reaching its tentacles into San Francisco for some time now, just as the suburban tech companies of Puget Sound—Microsoft, Amazon, and now Google and Facebook too—infiltrated Seattle. But the scale of the San Francisco infestation is far greater. For years, increasing numbers of techies have been commuting from San Francisco to the Valley, but with startups increasingly populating San Francisco itself, the foreign host seems to have taken up native residence. The indigenous populations are concerned that they are being invaded by pod people seeking to turn San Francisco into the Next Silicon Valley. These pod people raise the rents, they have their own buses, and many of them don’t know who Cesar Chavez was.  (N.B. I am a New York pod person who used to work for Google.) The archetype of the Silicon Valley techno-libertarian is inimical to everything that artist-friendly, countercultural, way-left-of-American-center San Francisco has historically stood for. Ex-PayPal billionaire Peter Thiel is the de facto spokesman for these types, whether he’s complaining about how it’s not politically correct “to articulate certain truths about the inequality of abilities,” or funding Ron Paul, or wanting to abolish the Food and Drug Administration, or bemoaning how giving women the right to vote hurt the libertarian cause. Yes, he gives back, but in the form of utopian moonshots at the technological singularity. Back on planet Earth, you’ve also got the founder of seed accelerator Y Combinator, Paul Graham, another smart fellow with a bit of a John Galt complex. He says that most people think that it’s unfair that 5 percent of people have half the total worth, but “an experienced programmer would be more likely to think is that all?” Or there’s Greg Gopman, until recently the CEO of San Francisco–based AngelHack, who thinks that “there should be an area of town for degenerates and an area of town for the working class,” as he posted on Facebook earlier this month. “The difference is in other cosmopolitan cities,” Gopman added, “the lower part of society keep to themselves.” (During a protest against Google’s buses, a union organizer exploited this Monty Burns persona by posing as a Google employee and shouting at protesters, “This is a city for the right people who can afford it.”) Gopman is a caricature of the quintessential Silicon Valley go-getter as often portrayed in the tech press: a young white male, innovative, wet behind the ears, indifferent to social convention, and soon very rich thanks to a hot new idea that attracts a wave of venture capitalist cash his way. It’s a testament to the capitalist dream at work, the power of innovation when the government just stays out of the picture and lets the Galts of the world take over. Their ideal vision of San Francisco would indeed be a scary place, where the rich could call the shots on the grounds that they are “giving back” in the form of productivity and jobs, even if a huge chunk of the population is excluded from those benefits. But theirs is not the San Francisco that the majority of techies would like to see. It is just the vision of the most loudmouthed techies. The VC/startup crowd presented in the press is only one facet of a larger culture, and hardly the most flattering one. As a software engineer, here are some rough statistical generalizations I can make based on the thousands of engineers—not businesspeople or execs, though some later moved into those roles—whom I’ve met in the field. They are male by a significant margin. They are otherwise the most diverse group of people I have ever been around, with a sizable percentage of immigrants from Asia, Europe, and South America. Particularly after George W. Bush’s election, there appeared to be very few Republicans among them. More of them go to Burning Man than to church. They are reflexively social libertarians. (The tech scene contains a strong polyamorous community, for example.) They are openly horrified by the irrationalism of much American political discourse of the right and center-right, by which I mean everyone from James Inhofe to Max Baucus—i.e., well over half of the Senate. Like economists Joseph Stiglitz and Nouriel Roubini as well as Warren Buffett, they see that inequality does not make for a stable political system, and they are broadly supportive of public policy measures that would help rebalance the scales. They don’t complain about taxes much. They don’t reflexively loathe Big Government—a programmer friend of mine marveled at what a mess healthcare.gov was next to the elegant and efficient government-run health website of Sweden—but they don’t think of it as the cure for all ills. Remember, a lot of these people are from the former Soviet Union and China, and are fully aware that calling Obamacare “Communist” is tantamount to spitting on the memories of millions dead. If they happen to live in a district with great public schools, they’d send their kids there both for cost and civic reasons; if they don’t, they won’t martyr their family to a dysfunctional educational system. Hence, expensive private schools. For these more rank-and-file techies, the Next Silicon Valley should not go to über-capitalist, libertarian extremes. Instead, it should be a pragmatic assemblage of what has worked best around the world—a functioning, integrated society, not one in which the haves and the have-nots barely speak the same language. (Note that Silicon Valley’s decadelong congressional representative, Mike Honda, is a hardcore liberal, winning his past two elections with more than 70 percent of the vote.) The lay techies are not flashy, tend not to seek attention, and tend to associate with like-minded individuals. Like-minded individuals largely do not include tech journalists, who tend to lack basic technical knowledge. (Hey, I just report what I hear.) So the tech journalists instead go to the flashy entrepreneurs who will talk to them: people like Greg Gopman and Yahoo’s old-boy network. And those tech journalists who are most contemptuous of Silicon Valley archetypes, like Valleywag’s Sam Biddle, spend more time writing click bait about those wannabe Howard Roarks than about the far more influential techies who founded, say, MoveOn and ActBlue. Founded in 2004 by theoretical physicist Ben Rahn and MIT computer science grad Matt DeBergalis, ActBlue has attempted to continue the Howard Dean campaign’s decentralized-network model for grassroots political activism, even as the Democratic Party hasn’t embraced it. DeBergalis has a new startup, Meteor, an open-source Web app development platform more interesting than Coin, Bitcoin, and Uber put together. But as I said, programmers don’t read tech journalism. Neither ActBlue nor its compatriots like the Progressive Change Campaign Committee—which was co-founded by the late cyberactivist Aaron Swartz and initiated the successful Draft Elizabeth Warren campaign—are enough to undo the income inequality that has ballooned in America over the past 30 years, and that has hit the middle and working classes of San Francisco particularly hard. Progressive organizations like these have a vision for the future of San Francisco—and for every place that could become a Next Silicon Valley—that represents the majority of tech workers’ beliefs. They are better bellwethers for the tech laity than the seething froth that populates the front pages of TechCrunch and Pando. These kinds of sites follow money rather than technology, they interview the wrong people about the wrong things, and they contribute to the image of Silicon Valley as a bunch of entitled white boys. Silicon Valley has its fair share of those sorts, but they drown out the voices we should really be listening to.   David Auerbach is a writer and software engineer based in New York.

Disney Business in Tinseltown is as unpredictable as it was 30 years ago IN 1983, when William Goldman, a star screenwriter, revealed the inner workings of the film-making business in "Adventures in the Screen Trade", Hollywood was in turmoil. The studios were reeling from a string of flops, most notably "Heavenâ€™s Gate", a Western released the previous year that had cost $44m (a huge sum in those days), ruining United Artists, the studio that made it. Mr Goldmanâ€™s book is best remembered for coining the rule that in his industry, "nobody knows anything": it is anyoneâ€™s guess whether a film will be a hit or a miss. Three decades on, following such big-budget turkeys as "The Lone Ranger" (pictured), the situation in Hollywood is much the same. Only more so. These days the studios assume that to get people into the cinemas, films must be splashier, so production budgets can run in excess of $300m and cost an additional $100m-150m to market. When Disneyâ€™s "Johnny Carter", an adventure flick, bombed last year, the entertainment giant suffered a $160m write-off. Its studio boss, Rich Ross, was told: so long, and letâ€™s do lunch some time. As the studios spend ever more on lavish prequels, sequels and "franchise" films, supposedly as a way to reduce risk by backing proven formulas, there is a growing danger that these movies will be nixed by jaded punters. Steven Spielberg, no introduction necessary, reckons that the studios could face "meltdown" if several big films flop at once. Studios are increasingly putting out just two types of film: mega-budget ones that can move the needle for the conglomerates that own them, and tiddlers for under $25m that can do nicely when they work. "Hollywood is like America," says Kevin Misher, a producer. "The middle class has been squeezed." Mr Goldman described how, by 1983, the studios had all but given up developing their own ideas. Instead freelance writers, producers and other outsiders toured Hollywood touting ready-cooked packages, often with the stars already signed on and the script written. Now the studios, having cut their remaining development spending to boost their marketing budgets, are even more reliant on outsiders to design their product; imagine if Apple or Toyota did this. The studios are also looking outside for the money to finance films. A new species of intermediaries, such as Village Roadshow Entertainment Group and Skydance, have sprung up to bankroll projects. As Mr Goldman described it, studio executives were like baseball managers: "They wake up every morningâ€¦with the knowledge that sooner or later theyâ€™re going to get fired." Again, this is now truer than ever. As filmsâ€™ budgets have expanded, so too has the risk that a flop will end an executiveâ€™s career. The past 18 months have seen more executive turnover than usual: four out of the six main studios have seen change at the top. In 1983 studio executives were often failed agents. Now they seem to be businesspeople. For example, Jeff Shell, who took over Comcastâ€™s Universal Pictures in September, is a television boss with no background in film. Since everybody still knows that nobody knows, studios continue to show early cuts of films to focus groups, to determine how to tweak and market them. But even after a filmâ€™s release it remains unclear why it boomed or bombed. Why was "Gravity", starring George Clooney and Sandra Bullock in a tale about stranded astronauts, one of this yearâ€™s hits despite the misgivings of its studio, Warner Bros, whereas "The Lone Ranger" was such a flop, despite Disneyâ€™s high hopes for a film starring Johnny Depp? "Hollywood is always in crisis," jokes an unusually publicity-shy talent agent. Indeed, his office is in Century City, a district full of high-rises in Los Angeles that was once the backlot of 20th Century-Fox until it had to sell up because of the crippling cost of its 1963 epic, "Cleopatra". Faced with bankruptcy 50 years ago, Fox might have been better off keeping the property and junking the film-making. The industryâ€™s return on capital has been chronically anaemic. The media conglomerates that own the major studios grouse about the lousy economics of the business, particularly since DVD sales peaked in 2004 and then waned, with consumers shifting to lower-cost rentals and subscription services like Netflix. Technology should have helped Hollywood, by lowering the cost of distributing films, but it has also cost the industry dearly, as film-makers doll up their movies with expensive special effects, and negative social-media buzz kills films before they even open. Thirty years ago Hollywood tried to make films that appealed to "popcorn buyers": 16- to 24-year-olds who used to go to cinemas in droves before they became so preoccupied by their smartphones. Then they focused on films that would sell well on DVDs for home viewing. At the peak in 2004 the sale of physical media accounted for 48% of the big studiosâ€™ revenues in America, according to IHS, a research firm. Since then, the value of their sales has dropped by almost half. Today Hollywood tries to tailor its products to the tastes of film buffs in big emerging economies, especially China, which is now the worldâ€™s second-largest movie market. The farther a film can travel, the better, which means the studios are exporting films with fewer American elements. "Big Hollywood films have no national ideology attached to them today," says Michael Lynton, the boss of Sony Pictures. Consider Foxâ€™s four "Ice Age" cartoons, which together grossed around $800m. They are set in no identifiable time or place, and the characters can easily be dubbed into local languages. Hollywood has always been a "caste-system town", in Mr Goldmanâ€™s words. That remains true, but the tiers are shifting. Working in television used to be considered less desirable than unemployment; today it is where most of the money is, so writers, producers and the studios themselves are focusing more on television. As for Mr Goldman, who is 82, he has moved to New York, and is writing a musical. As luck would have it, the big film studios are putting money into Broadway musicals. But as "Springtime for Hitler" showed (Mel Brooksâ€™s story of a musical designed to flop that becomes a smash hit), even here nobody really knows anything. Click here to subscribe to The Economist 
REUTERS/Jonathan ErnstHas John Boehner finally seen the light? Daylight emerges between Republicans in Congress and ideologues outside it AS WITH many other things that happened in the 1960s, the origin of the conflict between the governing wing and the ideological wing of the Republican Party is a bit fuzzy. Most date it to 1964, the year Barry Goldwater ran for president on a small-government platform and won only six states. The Republican civil war, as it is known to politicos, has now lasted five years longer than the cold war. It would be foolish to attach too much importance to a single battle. Even so, the budget vote in the House of Representatives at the close of 2013 marked an important shift. By voting for the deal, House Republicans defied the unelected bit of the party--which resides in think-tanks, lobbying organisations and political action committees--by 169 votes to 62. In the run-up to the vote, lobby groups such as the Club for Growth, which awards congressmen points for voting against tax increases, and Heritage Action, which campaigns for fiscal and social conservatism, had urged Republicans to reject the deal on the ground that it was a spending rise in disguise. "I donâ€™t care what they do," John Boehner, the House Speaker, told a press conference after the vote. On December 17th the bill moved forward in the Senate, as 12 Republican senators voted not to filibuster it. It is now highly likely to pass. Until recently, conservative pressure groups appeared to hold more sway over House Republicans than Mr Boehner did. Many congressional Republicans feared that they would fund primary challengers in their districts. Primary My Congressman, a website run by the Club for Growthâ€™s political action committee, is currently running an advert that invites the viewer to "click here to defeat Mike Simpson", a Republican congressman from Idaho who is one of Mr Boehnerâ€™s allies. Because few voters on either side turn up to primaries, an insurgent candidate can sometimes unseat an incumbent with only the support of a small but motivated clutch of voters. The groups that seek to harden congressional Republicans against compromise with the other arms of government are cross about being pushed aside. "There are over 150 Republicans who just voted for a spending rise in exchange for minimal entitlement reform," says Barney Keller of the Club for Growth. "They always use the same argument: that they have to be around so they can vote for the hard stuff later." "The question is whether the Speaker will continue to say that conservative voters are not really welcome," says Dan Holler of Heritage Action. Yet these organisations have finite resources. They cannot back primary challenges against all congressional Republicans, so there is some safety in numbers. And their influence can seem greater than it really is. Most Republican congressmen cast conservative votes because they are conservatives, rather than because they are frightened of being primaried. Only 13 of the 232 House Republicans have declined to sign a pledge never to vote for a tax increase. Tax revenues as a share of GDP have fallen slightly over the past decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. "Lots of these groups were set up to hunt RINOs [Republicans in name only]," says one veteran anti-tax campaigner. "But the truth is there are not many around now." Though it may sound like something else, the argument is about tactics rather than beliefs. "The leadership is saying to these groups: if you have a point of view then you have to come up with a workable strategy to make it happen," says David Winston, a Republican pollster. This might seem obvious. But less than three months ago the partyâ€™s unelected wing championed a half-baked plan to shut down the government until Democrats agreed to defund Obamacare--something the Democrats would never do. When House Republicans did indeed shut down part of the government, their poll ratings collapsed and they had to back down. That mistake was a result of a longstanding weakness. In March the Republican National Committee published its analysis of why the party lost the 2012 presidential election and what it needed to do in order to win again. "We have become expert in how to provide ideological reinforcement to like-minded people," it read, but "we have lost the ability to be persuasive with, or welcoming to, those who do not agree with us on every issue." This is still a work in progress. But a newfound willingness on the part of elected Republicans to ignore the partyâ€™s professional purists from time to time is a good start.

Wikimedia CommonsIndonesian RupiahNEW YORK (Reuters) - When the Federal Reserve first started talking about cutting its massive stimulus earlier this year, emerging-market currencies went into a tailspin. This time round, investors don't see that happening. Throughout the summer, while U.S. equities held relatively steady, riskier foreign markets were crushed, and their currencies battered by talk of a Fed pullback. Now, many investors are convinced the Fed's tapering won't cause that kind of market volatility again, and U.S. rates won't spike, just rise slowly. If that's the case, investors will be emboldened to move back into emerging currencies. The Fed cuts started this week when it reduced its monthly bond-buying to $75 billion from $85 billion. A reduction in the Fed's quantitative easing is supposed to benefit the greenback because it would raise U.S. rates, making those assets more attractive. It also curbs the supply of cash that tends to flow into riskier assets such as emerging market economies. Some emerging market debt and currencies have become more attractive over the last six months, fund managers said, and the Fed's decision has not diminished their allure. "Once the cat (Fed tapering) is out of the bag and the outcome should be much lower volatility than what we saw in the past, market participants will likely return to the emerging market world by buying the more solid fundamental names with attractive valuations and higher interest rates," said Thomas Kressin, senior vice president and head of European foreign exchange at global bond fund PIMCO in Munich, Germany. Traders don't expect the Fed to hike interest rates earlier than July 2015. When the Fed previously suggested it might start winding down its stimulus, some emerging market debt and currencies tumbled. The Indian rupee, for instance, has lost 11 percent this year. "There has been significant underperformance in emerging market debt, not only in May and June, but also recently when rates have risen as well," said Mike Swell, co-head of global lead portfolio management, at Goldman Sachs Asset Management in New York, which manages more than $349 billion in fixed income, currency and commodity assets. cut? On the other hand, the Mexican peso has proven more resilient, falling just 1.1 percent in 2013, along with the South Korean won, which actually gained 0.2 percent. Pimco's Kressin, for one, thinks a long Mexican peso and short U.S. dollar trade is one of the more intriguing bets for 2014. With the U.S. outlook improving, Mexico is expected to benefit because of its strong trade relationship with the world's largest economy. One-year volatility on the Mexican peso has dropped to 12.1 percent on Friday from highs of 15.02 percent in early September. The Mexican peso's volatility has become a barometer of risk for emerging market currencies because of the breadth of that market. PRESSURE FOR SOME EMERGING MARKETS Countries that have to import capital to finance domestic spending such as South Africa and India could see their exchange rates suffer, while those with surpluses such as Mexico won't feel as much of a pinch. In Mexico's case, not only do investors think its economy is fundamentally sound, its assets have higher returns as well. Mexico's 10-year government bonds yield 6.33 percent, compared to the U.S. ten-year note of 2.92 percent. The Mexican peso, meanwhile, is 5 percent undervalued against the dollar, according to Commerzbank researchers. From a developed market-perspective, Mexico can give you stable returns, without having to incur a lot of risk, said Mario Robles, director and head of Latin American research at Commerzbank in New York. Swell said Goldman has added emerging market debt - both local currency as well as in dollar, with an emphasis on Latin America. "Latin America has underperformed both from a rate perspective and currency perspective." Some fund managers have cited Brazil's currency and debt as value plays in the midst of the Fed's tapering. The Brazilian real has fallen nearly 14 percent this year, and some fund managers think it will stabilize in 2014. The U.S. dollar is currently trading at 2.36 reals, and Standish Asset Management thinks despite the tapering, the greenback will be contained within the 2.20-2.40 trading band. "We think the Brazilian real is fairly valued," said Federico Garcia Zamora, director of currency strategies and senior portfolio manager at Standish Asset Management in Boston, which oversees assets of about $163 billion. He noted Brazil's returns of between 10-12 percent on short-term bonds with maturities ranging from one to three years. This allows investors borrowing in lower-yielding currencies more "carry trade cushion," and the selloff in the real makes it a more attractive time to put on such trades. "The combination of the two has made us more comfortable in the emerging market space," he said. (Editing by David Gaffen and Andrew Hay)
REUTERS/Ilya NaymushinFA Insights is a daily newsletter from Business Insider that delivers the top news and commentary for financial advisors. The 'Dogs Of The Dow' Investment Strategy Is Becoming Popular Again, But It Doesn't Work (Barron's) The "Dogs of the Dow" is an investment strategy in which investors buy the 10 highest-yielding stocks in the Dow Jones as the start of each year. It was first popularized by Michael B. O' Higgins in 1991 and is now considered to be a top investment idea for 2014 by many advisors. But Jack Hough at Barron's thinks this strategy no longer works.  "The strategy contains the kernel of a good idea. Value investing works, because investors tend to be too negative on beaten-down stocks and too positive on market darlings. Any systematic approach to selecting companies that look cheap relative to measures of fundamental value is a good start. Just as some investors look for low price-to-earnings ratios, the Dogs strategy selects low price-to-dividend ratios (that is, high dividend yields). It's a bit arbitrary. There's no particular reason it should start in January and reset precisely once a year. And the Dow Jones Industrial Average isn't especially representative of the broad market (nor is it an average, or particularly industrial, or owned any longer by Dow Jones). "The biggest reason the strategy looks outdated, however, is that it ignores most of the cash companies return to shareholders. Back in 1980, share repurchases were rare. Over the past year, big U.S. companies have spent about $1.50 on share repurchases for each $1 they've spent on dividends." Eight Lessons Investors Can Learn From "The Wolf Of Wall Street" (WealthManagement.com)  Investors can learn important lessons from The Wolf Of Wall Street, which tells the story of Jordan Belfort's debaucherous lifestyle and the pump and dump scheme he ran that that paid for it, writes Andrew Stoltmann in WealthManagement.com. 1. Investors should hang up on any broker or financial advisor that cold calls them. 2. Investors should also avoid IPOs. Belfort's scams involved IPOs in which the company and their friends owned large stakes. 3. Only deal with well known firms because then investors have a better chance of successfully suing the firm in the case of a fraud. 4. Always perform a background check. 5. Don't feel like you have to be courteous and polite. Stratton Oakmont brokers "loved cold calling Midwest investors because they were reluctant to report fraud or hang up the phone," writes Stoltmann. 6. Don't let a salesperson rush you. 7. Be wary of those that promise risk free high returns. 8. Constantly monitor returns and ask tough questions.  Investors Yank $12 Billion From Global Stock Mutual Funds (FA Mag)  Investors pulled $12 billion from stock mutual funds around the world in the week ending Wednesday, according to Bank of America. Investors worried that the Fed's decision to taper its monthly asset purchase program to $75 billion  would hurt the stock market. Emerging market stock funds were especially hard hit, with investors pulling $3.1 billion, in the eighth consecutive week of outflows. How The Best Hedge Funds Beat Out Rivals (Bloomberg)  A study by Russel Jame of the University of Kentucky, cited by Bloomberg, finds that the top 30% of hedge funds outperform by making short term, contrarian bets. "Star hedge funds secure profits over short periods, with more than 25 percent of an annual outperformance occurring within a month after a trade," reports Simon Kennedy at Bloomberg. "The profits are also often made when managers have bet against the prevailing market view." "The winning funds are net buyers of so-called growth stocks, which are those of companies whose earnings are forecast to grow faster than the market average. They also don’t trade more frequently or more profitably prior to corporate earnings’ announcements, undermining any idea that insider trading explains how they make profits." JIM ROGERS: 50% Corrections In Markets Are Normal, So Why Not Gold? (Business Insider) Gold prices are at three-year lows but Jim Rogers thinks that after a 12 year rise that was an anomaly, the correction may be an anomaly too. He also attributed the sell-off to India's efforts to curb gold purchases. "IF they can force the largest buyer to become a seller [much less a larger seller], who knows how low gold could go?" But he doesn't think the faithful have thrown in the towel yet. But since even 50% corrections are normal in markets, he asks why such a correction wouldn't be normal in gold.
The Fed tried to justify the tapering on the grounds that the economy was improving, while simultaneously conceding that it was so fragile it needed about two or more years of zero fed funds rates even though the expansion is already in its 52nd month..  Yet the facts, as we outline below show very little, if any improvement while the Fed’s own forecasts were not much changed from their September projection. In our view, the Fed is recognizing the diminishing returns and potential damage from the continuation of QE3, and is thinking that it had better start tapering now.  In order to justify the move, Bernanke had to talk about a better economy now, while soothing the market with the stated intention of extending zero fed funds rates well beyond the previous 6.5% unemployment rate benchmark. While almost everyone seems to think that the economy has shown a lot of recent improvement, the facts don’t seem to bear this out. For the last few years, the economic numbers have bounced around from month to month, but basically have stayed within a limited range without breaking out on either the upside or the downside. Payroll employment increased by an average of 191,000 per month in the year ending November 2013, compared to 184,000 in November 2012, and a high proportion were in part-time or low-paying jobs.  Real consumer spending rose by 2.1% in the year ended October 2013, compared to 1.8% in October 2012 and 2.3% in October 2011.  Real Disposable income climbed 1.8% in the year ended October 2013, and 1.7% in each of the prior two years.  Industrial production was up 3.2%, 3.3% and 3.4%, respectively, in each of the last three years.  Core new orders for durable goods have slipped 4.3% in the last four months.  Existing home sales have declined on a year-to-year basis for the first time in 29 months and the ongoing drop in pending home sales and the mortgage purchase index indicate that the decline has further to go.    We also note that the Fed’s economic forecasts have consistently overstated the economy’s strength.  Using the mid-point of their average forecast range, in January 2011, they projected GDP growth of 3.7%, 4% and 4% for 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively. The results were 1.7%, 1.8% and an estimated 2%, respectively.  In November 2011, the Fed forecast for 2014 was 3.6%%, and is now 2.8%.  Their September 2012 forecast for 2015 was 3.4% and has now been reduced to 2.9%. Even the Fed’s so-called long-run GDP forecast has been subject to reduction.  It was 2.7% in January 2011, and 2.2% now.  It has been reduced in each of the Fed’s last three forecasts, which are made every three months.  And interestingly enough, their current projections for 2014 and 2015 GDP are actually lower than when QE3 started. None of this is meant to blame the Fed.  Forecasting the economy is an inherently tough job, and nobody really gets it consistently right.  In addition, monetary policy is not equipped to deal with the many complexities of a modern industrial economy, particularly with a dysfunctional fiscal policy pulling in the opposite direction. We have maintained for a number of years that, following a major credit crisis, household debt deleveraging would hold back economic growth for many years, and that is what  has been happening.  We underestimated the positive effect Quantitative Easing would have on the market as well as the ability of corporations to increase profit margins in the face of tepid revenues.  Now, with wages at an historical low and profit margins at an historical high relative to GDP, the rubber band has been stretched about as far as it can go, and the coming readjustment is likely to be painful for the economy and for stocks.  
In Europe, the mood is morose and the prospects seem dire. The general consensus is that things are going to be bad, the only conversation is around how bad things will get. Well, I have good news for you, for the consensus is dead wrong! We are in fact facing a wonderful future and I want to explain to you why. Let me take you back in time to the late 1970s, for they seemed to mark the beginning of the end of Western Civilization. OECD countries were suffering from stagflation with inflation and unemployment above 10%. We had suffered from 2 oil shocks. The U.S. had lost Vietnam. The Shah had fallen in Iran. The Soviet Union had invaded Afghanistan. Dictatorships were the norm in Eastern Europe, South East Asia, Latin America and even Southern Europe. The Club of Rome had made dire predictions that the world would run out of oil, coal and many natural resources within 40 years. No one predicted that over the next 40 years there would be democracies across Latin America, Eastern Europe and Southern Europe; that inflation and unemployment would fall dramatically; that we would see the greatest creation of wealth in the history of humanity as 1 billion people came out of poverty. 650 million came out of poverty in China alone, completely changing urban landscapes across the country as a whole. Despite 40 years of record consumption of oil and natural gas we now have more reserves than we did then. The way we work and live has been profoundly transformed by computers, the Internet and mobile phones. If we take a further step back, we can see that over the last 100 years economic downturns — be they recessions that occur every few years or bigger crises such as the Great Depression — as painful as they are while we live them, barely register in a background of unabated economic growth. In fact over the last 100 years human lifespans have doubled from 40 to 80, average per capita income has tripled and childhood mortality has divided by 10. The cost of food, electricity, transportation and communications have dropped 10 to a 1,000 fold. Global literacy has gone from 25% to over 80% in the last 130 years. We have redefined what poverty means. Today 99% of Americans in poverty have electricity, water, toilet and refrigerator. 95% have a television. 88% have a mobile phone. 70% have a car and air conditioning. The richest people 100 years ago could only dream of such luxuries. We are also living in the most peaceful time in human history; not just of recent history, but in the history of humanity. We are truly living in extraordinary times. Improvements of this magnitude are continuing today. When historians look back at these past 10 years I suspect that what they will find most remarkable is not the financial crisis, the euro crisis or the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, but the remarkable growth of Africa. Over the past 10 years 6 of the top 10 fastest growing economies have been African. Africa is rapidly becoming integrated in the global economy. The current environment of austerity has been leading states to want to do less with less, but there is a real opportunity for states to do more with less. Countries like Estonia are showing the world how the application of existing technology can revolutionize areas of the economy that have yet to be touched by the technology revolution, especially in healthcare, medicine and public services which account for more than 50% of GDP in OECD countries. Over 24% of people voted online in the 2011 elections. 93% of Estonians fill personal tax returns online. Estonians can set up a company online in minutes. Parents can check their children’s homework, grades and attendance records online. All medical records are online. New technologies are emerging that are going to revolutionize almost every sector of our economy. 3D printing is not only revolutionizing prototyping, but is increasingly being combined with traditional manufacturing to make end products. 25% of 3D printer output is production-ready items. It also has the potential to revolutionize medicine as the printing of a mini kidney demonstrated. 3D printed organs based on our personal genetic make-up will eliminate the organ shortage and rejection issues in the next 10 years. Medicine is on the verge of a transformation. IBM’s Watson is already better at diagnosing certain types of cancers that doctors are. This makes sense as computers have the patience and eye for detail to go through every millimeter of an MRI scan or x-ray. Granted Watson cost $21 million to build and develop, but with Moore’s law today’s expensive supercomputer is tomorrow’s $100 cell phone. In fact, we are less than 5 years away from having a functioning Star Trek-like medical tricorder: a cellphone-sized device that can diagnose most illness better than most doctors. Robots have already invaded factories and are now set to percolate in and dramatically improve our everyday life. Darpa has built the Atlas robot, a 6-foot tall robot designed to save lives in disaster zones. The Da Vinci Robot has already performed minimally invasive surgeries on over 200,000 patients. In a few years, drones will deliver over 80% of Amazon’s products in less than one hour, while self-driving cars deliver most of the rest. Google announced last week that robots are its next big project and has acquired 7 robotic companies in the last few years. The “Internet of Things” is taking our everyday appliances to a new level. Connected coffee makers, vacuum cleaners, microwaves and lamps learn our habits to serve us better, more cost efficiently. To give you a few examples, the Quirky made Egg-minder reminds people when eggs are going bad. As simple as this sound, improvements like this can have tremendous impact. Imagine if we all reduced our food waste by 50%. One of the most popular objects of the Internet of Thing today is the Nest thermostat. It learns our behavior, routines and the temperature we like, helping us live in a more pleasant environment while saving on our heating bills! The Internet of things is not about things, but about improving our lives. Education is also on the cusp of a revolution. If we transported Socrates forward in time 2,500 years, the way we teach our kids is one of the few things he would recognize: a teacher, of varying quality, spewing facts to students, of varying quality. Some schools are now experimenting with using gamified learning software to create challenging personalized curriculum for each of their students with continuous testing. The students are more engaged because they have challenging material at their level. Teachers are freed from being mere fact-spewing machines and start playing the role of personal coach. A few schools have tried this with extremely promising early results. Education is also in the process of becoming scalable with the best professors reaching hundreds of thousands of students as many classes on the top MOOCs, Udacity and Coursera, have shown. Education is being democratized and is transforming itself in a lifelong endeavor as people from everywhere in the world, of every age, at every stage in life can take classes on the likes of Khan Academy or Code Academy. Transportation is also on the verge of a revolution. Every year, in the U.S., 5.5 billion hours and 2.9 billion gallons of fuel representing $121 billion in economic value are lost to congestion. Over 1.2 million lives are lost to accidents each year globally on top of the injuries and economic costs imposed by 50 million accidents. We originally thought we would have to rebuild our entire infrastructure to support self-driving cars, but Google has demonstrated that we already have the technology to make autonomous self-driving vehicles. They currently are cost-prohibitive but the technology that they use is already being deployed in the mass-market with self-parking systems and automatic braking when traffic slows. In fact Tesla expects to have a car that can drive itself in 90% of situations in the next 3 years! It might take a few more years for self-driving cars to reach the mass market, but it looks like they will be mainstream within 10 years. Communications are also rapidly evolving. It makes perfect sense for Google to be working on glasses given that cellphones seem bound to disappear. We are making great progress in brain reading. We now have low resolution scanners than can scan images from people’s brains. We can project our thoughts and make them appear on screen. This currently requires expensive and unwieldy hardware but that is also set to shrink and become cheaper because of Moore’s law. Google Glasses will probably evolve to use lasers to print on our retina taking orders from our mind control rather than by voice. This technology will also give us the potential for telepathy as we will be able to send our thoughts directly to others if they want to receive them. Ultimately the glasses or intelligent contact lenses will probably disappear altogether as we will find a way to send images and thoughts directly to our brain. All this may sound sci-fie but it’s already in the labs and will be part of our reality within 15 years. Remember that 15 years ago few could conceive that we would all have smart phones that we would use as general computing devices. This is merely the next step of this evolution. Energy is also slowly being revolutionized and its revolution is one of the things making me most optimistic about the future of humanity. The idea that we are going to run out of energy is ludicrous. We are awash in it. Every 12 minutes we receive enough energy from the sun to meet all of our energy needs for an entire year. As Peter Diamandis, who runs the X Prize Foundation, likes to say, the issue is not scarcity, it’s accessibility. It’s one we have faced time and time again. In the 19th century aluminum was the most expensive metal in the world. It was more valuable than sliver, gold or platinum. That’s why the tip of the Washington Monument is in aluminum. It’s why Napoleon III when he received the King of Siam in the late 1850s gave silver utensils to his guests, gold for him and aluminum for the king. Aluminum is very abundant. It’s 7% of earth’s core, the 3rd most abundant element in the Earth’s crust. The issue is that it does not occur in natural form, which made it incredibly rare. Prices dropped dramatically in a few years after 1886 when chemists discovered electrolysis, which allowed them to separate pure aluminum from its ore. A similar process is under way with solar energy. It’s following a slow Moore’s law curve with solar power improving 14% per year in terms of energy production per dollar invested. In 1977, solar cells cost upwards of $70 per Watt. In 2013, that cost dropped to $0.74 per Watt, a 100:1 improvement. In fact, the costs dropped 50% in one year in 2011 driven by competition between Chinese manufacturers. Solar is already at grid parity in remote places. Based on current trends it will be at grid parity in sunny places of the U.S. by 2025 and most of the world by 2035. When that happens investments in its deployment will reach tens of billions of dollars. In other words even excluding disruptive innovation like fusion or radical increases in solar efficiency, without subsidies or government action, we will transition away from a carbon based economy by the middle of the 21st century. In fact the marginal megawatt should become so cheap that we should be in a position to “waste” it — the same way we waste the computing power in our cellphone or computer. Think about it. Computing power was so expensive we had to limit access to it. Now it’s so ubiquitous we use it to play Angry Birds or check Facebook. Its very cheapness has unleashed an extraordinary wave of innovation. The same will happen with energy. Once it’s cheap, many of our other problems go away. The idea that we will face a fresh water shortage is also ludicrous. The earth is 70% covered by water. The issue is once again accessibility as only 1.3% of it is surface fresh water. However in a world of unlimited energy it’s easy to desalinate salt water. In fact we may not even need to wait that long as new innovative devices like the Slingshot are coming on stream that can generate 1,000 liters of pure water per day from any water source, even saline or polluted. Once fresh water is abundant food also becomes abundant as you can grow crops in the dessert — and that’s not taking into consideration an agriculture productivity revolution that could come from urban vertical farms. As people we are truly blessed to be living in this amazing time. As entrepreneurs and investors we have the privilege of helping create this better world of tomorrow, a world of equality of opportunity and of plenty.
KWDesigns, FlickrA row of brownstones in New York's SoHo neighborhoodAs more and more super-pricey luxury condo buildings rise above New York City, international buyers are bucking the trend and purchasing historic townhouses instead.Â  According The Wall Street Journal's Candace Taylor, more and more foreigners are looking into buying brownstones as secondary residences, opting out of the condos that have long been popular for this particular group.Â  Townhouses, many of which were built in the late 19th and early 20th century, can be difficult to maintain, and they don't have the services that make living in a doorman building is so convenient. However, there are some unexpected benefits to living in a brownstone. As demand for luxury condos grows, housing boards for those buildings have begun investigating potential buyers' financial background more than ever before. The privacy of a townhouse would be much more attractive to Europeans or other foreigners who are not accustomed to disclosing their finances.Â  "More and more, the tendency is to go toward a full townhouse purchase because they can be anonymous, and they can get all the space for a fraction of the price," Adie Kriegstein, an agent at CORE who recently represented a French family in the purchase of a townhouse on West 77th Street, said to the Wall Street Journal.Â  The numbers show that townhouses in Manhattan do tend to be slightly cheaper than luxury condos. For the third quarter of 2013, the average price per square foot for a townhouse was $1,144, compared to $1,379 for condos. And the most expensive condos are much pricier than the most expensive townhouses â€” condos at 15 Central Park West average at $5,487 per square foot, compared to $2,440 per square foot at the Harkness Mansion on the Upper East side.Â  Plus, there are plenty of ways to create a full-service experience in a brownstone, from hiring a property manager to installing a virtual doorman.Â  All of the buzz surrounding townhouses is starting to spread toÂ historic walk-up apartments as well.Â  Data from real estate consultants Miller Samuel showed that the number of walk-ups sold increased by 64% over the last year, a huge jump compared to the 22% increase for apartments in full-service doorman buildings.Â  "There is a new generation of renters out there who donâ€™t need a doorman, and want something unique and different," Jordan Sachs, president of residential brokerage firm Bold New York, told The New York Times. "Walk-ups can offer a wonderful combination of old prewar New York mixed with new design, and that can be hard to find in a cookie-cutter doorman building."

December 23, 2013 marks the centennial of the passage of the Federal Reserve Act, which created what is now the most important economic institution in the world. Â  To mark the occasion, we've compiled the 15 most YOLO â€” which stands for "You Only Live Once," and means throwing all concerns overboard â€” moments over the course of the Fed's 100 years. You would think that a body composed of economics and math Ph.Ds that conducts most of its operations on a computer would be devoid of drama.Â  You'd be wrong. Check it out. Jekyll Island Museum The idea to found the Fed was hashed out in secret over nine days in 1910 on a remote enclave off the coast of Georgia called Jekyll Island, owned by J.P. Morgan. Then as now, bankers were not the most well-loved people in America, so the participants traveled down to Brunswick slightly incognito, only referring to each other by first name. One of the men, a naturalized German industrialist named Paul Warburg who a key driving force for the Fed's creation, brought a shotgun on the train down to look like a duck hunter, despite never having dressed an animal in his life. Source:Â Neil Irwin, "The Alchemists" St. Louis Fed One of the original proposals for the Federal Reserve banking system was to place a Federal Reserve Bank in Cincinnati. It would have covered Ohio, Kentucky, and Indiana. It even made it into a final round of voting. But for practical and possibly political considerations â€” one academicÂ saysÂ local bankers charged political bias against Cincinnati's historic Republican leanings â€” Cinci was placed under the control of Cleveland. Source:Â St. Louis Fed Atlanta Fed Around 1920, the Fed decided it would open a branch in Havana, a major American tourist destination. Management of the office was split between the Atlanta and Boston feds. In 1926, Cuba's banking system began teetering, and the Fed decided it would step in to prop it up.Â Forty-two pouches of registered mail were packed into the gunboat "Cuba," which took off at 5 pm on April 11 from Key West. ]The bank run was stanched, but the drama ended up jumping back stateside, when Washington began investigating charges that,Â "on the way over from Key West to Havana the entire party from Atlanta became intoxicated" and that they arrived in Havana "in a disgraceful condition."Â  The inquiry ultimately proved inconclusive, but the deputy governor of the Atlanta Fed lost his post.Â  Source:Â Atlanta Fed Google Images Â In 1927, the world economy was already showing signs of stress. So the heads of the central banks of France, Germany, and England, along with New York Fed President Benjamin Strong rented out the home of a U.S. Treasury official in Glen Cove, Long Island to try to work out a solution. The outcome of the meeting was inconclusive, though we obviously know what happened later â€” the stock market crashed. But Strong pointedly cut out anyone from the Federal Reserve in Washington from attending, having deemed world finance his realm. Source:Â "Neil Irwin, The Alchemists" Google Images Ben Bernanke has said that it was Meyer's Fed that prematurely ended what had obviously been a successful open-market securities purchasing program to stanch the Great Depression, causing the economy to relapse in 1932. Partially as a result, when President Roosevelt took power in 1933, he forced Meyer out. Meyer's next move? Buying the then-near-bankrupt Washington Post at a fire sale a month after leaving his post. So we have the prospect of a sitting Fed Chairman contemplating buying a major media outlet.Â  Source:Â St. Louis Fed Wikimedia In 1933, the U.S. economy had entered a deflationary spiral â€” no one was buying anything, and everyone was hoarding gold. Â To address the situation, President Roosevelt ordered the country to turn over their gold supplies. He also sought to take control of the Fed's gold supplies. Once gold was out of circulation, Roosevelt could better enforce his plan to reflate the economy. The cost of this would be the temporary end of Fed independence. Fed Chair Eugene Black was sympathetic, but figured the decision was best left to Congress. On Jan. 30, 1934, Congress passed the Gold Reserve Act and officially directed the Treasury to take over the Fed's gold holdings. To pay for them, a 100,000 bill featuring Woodrow Wilson was printed.Â  Source:Â St. Louis Fed Wikimedia Marinner Eccles was born into a prominent Mormon family in Logan, Utah â€” his father David founded and was the state's first multi-millionaire. Although he grew up with money, he ended his formal education at age 18 and went into business; by age 22 he is said to have made his first million. By sheer coincidence, he caught the attention of Stuart Chase, a well-connected national publicist, who happened to hear some of his speeches in Utah. Chase hooked him up with a close adviser to Roosevelt, and Eccles was invited to serve in the president's cabinet in 1933. Within a year, at the age of 44, he was appointed Fed Chair. Eccles served through Roosevelt's death and into the beginning of Harry Truman's administration. A Keynesian, Eccles also made sure the government had access to to cheap financing to enact Roosevelt's New Deal program. Eccles was also the principle architect of the current Fed structure, centralized the Fed's power into the Washington-based Board of Governors. The Fed's main building is now named after him. Â  Source:Â Marriott Library,Â Richmond Fed ASSOCIATED PRESS Nixon had sometimes blamed Martin's fiscal hawkishness on his failure to beat John Kennedy in 1960. So when he came up for reappointment in 1970, Nixon declined to reappoint him. Instead he tapped Arthur Burns, he president of the National Bureau of Economic Research. As with anyone else in his ostensible administration, Nixon demanded complete fealty to his whims, andÂ transcripts showÂ the president repeatedly telling Burns he wasn't doing enough to boost the economy despite Burns' repeated warnings about the unforeseen impact of looser monetary policy. Nixon would laterÂ plant a negative story about Burns in the pressÂ that he was asking for undue salary raise at a time of economic difficulty. Burns was eventually proven correct but appears to have lost sight of his initial reservations: inflation averaged 6.6% during his eight-year term. Source:Â Thomas Emerson Hall,Â Journal of Economic Perspectives,Â William Safire REUTERS This may be the most #YOLO moment in Fed history. To combat the inflation that had spiraled upward during Burns' and his successor Bill Miller, Paul Volcker raised interest rates to as much as 16% (by comparison rates are now at 0%) and essentially took the economy into temporary recession. It's not clear who first coined the phrase "shock therapy" to describe such drastic measures, but no one ever before Volcker purposely tanked the economy to save it. Money For NothingPictured center: Former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan (1987-2006) Appointed in 1987, Greenspan presided over the alleged Great Moderation of the American economy, and until everything started going south toward the end of his term, was widely credited with driving those gains. But he is now viewed by many as having been overly complacent about excessive growth, having done nothing to curb the "irrational exuberance" he himself called out in the mid-90s and which led to the 2000-2001 recession, and failing cool last decade's housing boom or reign in large financial institutions.Basically if you had a sexy, crazy '90s (GreenspanÂ married journalist Andrea Mitchell during his term; he was alsoÂ obsessed with Y2K) and then were forced to sober up in 2008, you lived the Greenspan Experience.Â He has sinceÂ admitted some of his errors, but many hard not to look back on his administration as an intense period of kool-aid drinking.Â  Jeff Gunn/flickr The Kansas City Fed began holding an annual banking conference in 1978. For the first three years of its existence, almost no one showed up. So in a bid to entice higher-profile names, KC Fed officials decided to hold it in Jackson Hole, Wyo. â€” the main vacation destination of then-Fed Chair Paul Volcker, who reveled in the area's world renowned fly fishing. It worked, and the remote town has hosted the most important economics conference in the world every August ever since.

By conventionally standards, the jokes are pretty lame, but it shows Fed governors and presidents are not so uptight as you'd imagine. The FOMC meeting that recorded the most instances of laughter, however, is somewhat ominous:Â at the June 27-28, 2007 meeting, there were 81. The average is usually around 40. Six months later, the economy officially entered recession. Â  People Â  They say Washington is Hollywood for ugly people, but one day in 2006, Hollywood actually entered the Fed record.

AP Photo/Carlos OsorioIn a photo from Tuesday, Dec. 10, 2013 at the Detroit Institute of Arts in Detroit a guest looks over the "Self Portrait" by Van Gogh, left, and "Portrait of Postman Roulin" by Van Gogh, both owned by the city of Detroit. Detroit-owned Bruegel painting valued up to $200M, Van Gogh $150M in Christie's appraisal DETROIT (AP) — The fair market values of some of the most popular pieces in the Detroit Institute of Arts — including Bruegel the Elder's "The Wedding Dance" and a Van Gogh self-portrait — have been released. Christie's auction house appraised about 2,800 paintings, sculptures, pottery and other city-owned artwork at the city's request. The list of the items and how much each would fetch at sale were released Thursday by the city. "The Wedding Dance" is valued at $100 million to $200 million, while Van Gogh's "Self Portrait with Straw Hat" was given a price tag of between $80 million and $150 million. State-appointed emergency manager Kevyn Orr hired Christie's to do the work. Orr has said city-owned art in the museum can be considered an asset and could be vulnerable during a bankruptcy. He filed for bankruptcy in July, and federal Judge Steven Rhodes approved the petition Dec. 3. The high values of some of Detroit's pieces are not surprising, said Charles Guerin, director of the Hyde Collection in Glen Falls, New York. "The art market has become a place to invest large sums of money," Guerin said. "Art is a commodity, especially when you get into those numbers. It's amazing somebody would even have $150 million to spend. There are a lot of wealthy people in the world who can look at $150 million as if it's chump change." According to the appraisal by New York-based Christie's, the city-owned pieces at the Detroit Institute of Arts are collectively worth between $454 million to $867 million. They represent about five percent of the museum's estimated 66,000-work collection. Orr has said the city's debt is at least $18 billion. That includes $5.7 billion in unfunded health care obligations and $3.5 billion in unfunded pension liabilities. He is expected to present a plan of adjustment for fiscal restructuring to the bankruptcy court in early January that will include his recommendations for the art. Guerin cautioned against selling any of the art, saying it would be "short-sighted." "Detroit is a great city. One of the things that make it a great city is that it has an absolutely great museum," he said. Here are some of the highlights of the appraisal: — "The Wedding Dance," Pieter Bruegel I, $100 million-$200 million. — "Self Portrait with Straw Hat," Vincent Van Gogh, $80 million-$150 million. — "The Visitation," Rembrandt Harmensz. Van Rijn, $50 million-$90 million. — "Le guéridon," Henri Matisse, $40 million-$80 million. — "Gladioli," Claude Monet, $12 million-$20 million. — "The Palla Altarpiece: Tobias and Three Archangels," Neri Di Bicci, $8 million-$15 million. — "Portrait of Hendrik Swalmius," Frans Hals, $6 million-$10 million. — "Madonna and Child," Giovanni Bellini and Workshop, $4 million-$10 million. — "Saint Jerome in His Study," Workshop of Jan Van Eyck, $4 million-$8 million. — "A dead hare with flowers and onions on a ledge," Jean-Simeon Chardin, $5 million-$7 million.

Chris ArnadeÂ left his jobÂ as a foreign exchange trader at a major investment bank to pursue photography full-time. He's not your typical photographer, though. Arnade,Â who is very critical of Wall Street, spends his time in some of the city's roughest neighborhoods. Some of his most powerful work comes from Hunts Point, Bronx, where he has photographed hundreds of drug addicts.Â Along with his photos, Arnade writes down his subjects' stories, with help from writerÂ Cassie Rodenberg. Below is a sample of photos and stories from Arnade'sÂ "Faces Of Addiction." You can follow him onÂ Twitter,Â Facebook,Â Tumblr, andÂ Flickr. Chris Arnade  Sonya was past complaining about the eye. The feet were the issue. The Uggs knockoffs, great when dry, were now a frozen mush of fur and dirt. A month of cold weather was wearing. She rubbed the eye, â€œI can still see out of it, so it's not getting worse.â€ My phone rang. Shelly had three minutes to speak, her call of the day from Rikers. â€œWhen you coming to visit? Did you get my stuff?â€ I handed the phone to Sonya who made two minutes of promises. They have been living under the same bridge for the last three weeks. The line clicked dead before I could talk more. â€œHe wants his make-up saved. He hid it before he got arrested.â€ Shelly. Arrested for shoplifting in the CVS. Always the same CVS. One month in Rikers. A forced detox for Christmas. Sonya limped towards the drug dealers clustered on the corner, looking for Xanax. â€œFive sticks. I can make it through detox if I have five sticks.â€ Chris Arnade Shelly bent over, focused on the items arrayed in front of her: Needle, cap, water, lighter, and cotton. All lit by candle. She spilled the heroin into the cap, added water, heated it into syrup. She dropped in a small swab of cotton, inserted the needle into the swab, and drew up the liquid. She looked down at her left forearm, slapped a vein, and slowly put in the needle, drawing up the blood to mix with the heroin. She blew on the needle, and pushed the blood and heroin back in. Her face and body went slack. Chris Arnade  A low needs a high, especially a low that now only gets you straight, keeps the sick away. Find any pipe, everyone has one. Pepsi keeps hers jammed in her bra. "Jessica keep hers jammed in her pussy. Cops won't go searching there." Place a wad of screen in end of pipe. Pour a few rocks onto it. Two lungs full, that is all you need. Five seconds of euphoria. Ten minutes of paranoia. Chris Arnade  Sonya knows how to look bad. It helps her make money panhandling. Today she wasnâ€™t panhandling. It was too cold and wet for that. She just looked bad. The snow had beat down her camp, now a pile of garbage and just the outline of a tent. When the wind blows hard enough, like today, the Bruckner, fifteen feet above, provides little protection. It was also a dumb decision to build on low-lying land. She sat in the mud working on her foot, the only place with a vein that wasnâ€™t corrupted. For five minutes she sat there, snow collecting on her hair, water working its way into her pants, and tried to make a needle go where it wasnâ€™t wanted. The busses, BX 6 and BX 7, came by every five minutes, spraying slush over the camp. Sonya stayed still focused on the needle, on the vein that wasnâ€™t much of a vein anymore. â€œSHIT! You fucking piece of shit! Go in damn you.â€ She finally quit, rolling her sock back onto her foot, her foot back into the boots. Everything was wet. â€œMy eye, itâ€™s red and oozing. Hard to open. My ear hurts. It was fine last night. I might have gotten glass in it. Glass is everywhere.â€ I offered to take her to the hospital, but Sonya doesnâ€™t like help, doesnâ€™t like doctors, and doesnâ€™t like needing anyone. Except that dirty bastard of a husband of hers, Eric. (Yes, Eric, when you are in detox and clean and reading this, you know that is what she calls you. Itâ€™s what you call yourself after all. You know she loves you more than anyone loves someone else. Still, you are a dirty bastard of a husband.) She smiled though. Sonya always manages a smile. She asked about my children, about my Thanksgiving, about me. â€œYou look tired Chris. You need some rest.â€ We went into the Bodega and she watched a TV she couldnâ€™t understand. She stood there for fifteen minutes, absorbing the heat and dry, laughing at the Spanish show, a drama about prisons and drugs. Actors shot pretend drugs into their arms and yelled at each other. â€œEveryone looks so clean. I guess they got a better drugs down there in Mexico. Reality is no TV show.â€ * Needles* Crack Pipes* Cigs* Lighters* Condoms* Make-up kit* Pipe cleaners* Mixing caps* Methadone program ID* Semi-sterile water* Left over McDonalds A man had just left, a small man hidden behind jackets, a man who paid $20 to have his dick sucked. Ramone had also left, to buy gas and drugs for Sarah and himself. Alone, Sarah and I talked about Thanksgiving, about being in the country, about being away from the city. She told of going to nature camp in Vermont when she was younger. â€œIt was my happiest moments, we raised the animals, swam, and every night we sat in a circle and told what was on our mind. Nobody made fun of anyone else. It was a Quaker camp, called Farm and Wilderness. I stopped going my last year, I still regret that decision.â€ I asked, â€œFarm and Wilderness, in Plymouth Vermont? My wife went to that camp.â€ I called my wife and [she and] Sarah spoke, reminiscing about a place they both attended, but at different times. Sarah put down the phone, took in hit of crack. â€œI loved that place. Loved it. Do you mind staying here alone for a bit. I got to run over to that truck. Will only be fifteen minutes.â€ Chris Arnade Jennifer arrived with $200, manic and generous. Enough money to let her stay the night, enough money to start the van and run the heat, enough money for McDonalds, enough money for Ramone to run to Gilbert Street, past the man hunched against the wind, through the door opened with a brick, up the stairs, into an apartment sweet with crack. $180 worth of drugs to bring back. Enough drugs to turn an old van into a drug trap. Ramone couldnâ€™t hit, his vein was too stingy. He could draw the blood out, mixing with heroin in the syringe, but it stayed there. He couldnâ€™t push it back in. Sarah held a light to his arm, encouraged him, keeping him calm. Jennifer laughed, crackling to herself, manic, rearranging her purse, her pipe, her dildo, her lighter, her condoms, her makeup, her purse again, her pipe again. A date was coming. A date, despite the cold, despite the wind. Can you believe it? Did you see the pipe? Did you? Do you know where the condoms are? You have a lighter? Where is the pipe? WHERE IS THE PIPE? Jennifer left, under dressed for the cold. Ramone pulled the needle, still filled with heroin and blood. He took in two pipes of crack, put on his layers. Back to Gilbert Street. Another bag. Maybe this one would be lucky. Sarah, alone in the van, let in a man, hidden beneath layers. She turned off the flashlight as he lowered his pants. Chris Arnade  Both were raped by family members before they were ten. Both escaped to the Bronx streets:Â TakeeshaÂ at eleven andÂ CarmelaÂ at twelve. Both started prostituting by thirteen. Carmela found men gave her things in exchange for her body. Takeeshaâ€™s mother sold her. Both started injecting heroin into their bodies soon after. Both have fought with addiction, the police, and men since. Both now have a habit that is close to $200 a day: Heroin to kill the sickness and crack to get a â€œlittle something.â€ Takeesha still believes in love. â€œI did love Steve. He got an anger problem but I can be a crazy bitch.â€ Carmela does not. â€œLove? There is no love out here. People only want what they can get from you.â€ Both are now together. â€œWe stayed up the first night talking and talking. We both like, â€œwow this person really understands what I have been through, understands I ainâ€™t just trash.â€™ We watch each otherâ€™s back. Right girl?â€ Chris Arnade The police, narcotics, and vice all swarmed Hunts Point two weeks ago in a crackdown that netted low-level possession, dealing, and prostitution charges. It also ensnared Takeesha who is now serving a two-month sentence in Rikers. This is common. Presently ten of my Bronx subjects sit in Rikers or upstate New York prisons on non-violent drug charges. When I left Hunts Point after Takeeshaâ€™s arrest I stopped by a bar close to my home in Brooklyn to write and drink a few beers. I often do this to collect my thoughts. I try to choose bars without a large drug scene, without lines to use the bathrooms, without annoying coked-out customers. That is hard to do since cocaine, pills, and other drugs are a reality of the Brooklyn and Manhattan bar scene. The drugs are done by white affluent customers. I have never seen any arrests. I have never seen anyone worried about being arrested. The stark difference I see between how drugs are treated in the Bronx and brownstone Brooklyn is jarring but not surprising. The statistics show exactly the same thing. The war on drugs is a war on the poor. It is as simple as that. Chris Arnade She slumped, arms splayed on the table, the pupils of her eyes pinholes. He watched their stuff; six plastic bags overflowing with clothes. They looked out of sorts in Hunts Point. White with New England accents, wearing second hand clothes, overly tight, or loose sweaters and slacks. An hour later they were asked to leave, their table needed to be cleaned. They walked into the McDonalds parking lot, hugged, and made out. She grabbed his crotch and smiled. Both laughed. They walked up the hill, towards the auto stores, counting their money. $9.50. They passed Sarah and Ramone, both who where resting before the three-mile walk to their methadone clinic. The woman stopped and looked at Sarah, â€œYou got fifty cents? We need it for the subway.â€ Sarah was putting on makeup, trying to hide the dirt from a night sleeping outdoors. Sarah smiled, â€œYou new ainâ€™t you.â€ â€œWe from Boston, on an adventure, towards the west. They told us to leave Manhattan, to come here. We didnâ€™t know Hunts Point was so bad, so many drugs. We donâ€™t do that. We just trying to make it on the cheap.â€ Sarah rolled up her sleeves, held out her arms, â€œItâ€™s ok, you can tell me. I been doing it all my life.â€ â€œNaaaa. That ainâ€™t us. We just looking for an adventure.â€ Sarah handed them a quarter. â€œItâ€™s all I got.â€ The couple smiled. â€œMy nameâ€™s Wendy. Maybe we see each other around.â€ They walked away. Sarah went back to putting on makeup. â€œWhy lie to another addict? Why? She donâ€™t think I can see it in her eyes, in her clothes, in her hair? She donâ€™t think I saw her passed out on the corner the other day? You canâ€™t start getting clean unless you admit it to yourself and others.â€ Chris Arnade â€œI found the hat on the ground. At first I thought it was a dead animal. Itâ€™s really warm. Really warm.â€ â€œI am sure there is a kid who lost it, who wants it back. When I am walking I am waiting for a child to run up to me and say, â€˜Thatâ€™s mine!â€™ although they probably too scared of me.â€ â€œWhen I stand panhandling I always remember an old addict I knew in Philadelphia. She was cold, tired, and hungry, and nobody was giving her anything. Eventually she just started saying, â€˜Can I have a dollar so I WONâ€™T DIE! JUST A DOLLAR TO KEEP ME ALIVE.â€™ Some days I feel like that.â€ Chris Arnade DÃ©jÃ â€™s mother was a crack addict and prostitute. At five DÃ©jÃ  started raising the other five children in the house. All shared a mother and none shared a father. At nine her mother was taken away and the children split up. DÃ©jÃ  ran away from her foster family at twelve and came out as a woman. â€œI picked up all sorts of habits. I started doing things I donâ€™t do, including smoking crack like my momma did.â€ She has been in Hunts Point only a week, â€œI relapsed so here I am.â€ She lives with Michael in an empty lot, working the track at night. â€œThe only way I can prostitute is to drink and to do cocaine. How can you pretend to love and have sex otherwise? Addiction makes you do things you don't want to do.â€ She sat in the cold spray of the hydrant, cooling off. â€œI want the white picket fence, the Tupperware parties, the husband and kids.â€ â€œDream? Thatâ€™s a fairy tale not a dream. Out here you canâ€™t have dreams.â€ Chris Arnade "I'm very intelligent but sometimes I feel disgusting because of what I do. I'm not really too happy with life, but I'm happy to be alive." -- Jennifer Jennifer, 21, grew up with various foster parents. Her biological mother and father were addicts. She remembers the smell of drugs from being a child. The sexual abuse started at 7 and continued until she fled her foster home. â€œMy virginity was taken by my step brother. He raped me when I was 12. Raped me repeatedly.â€ She now sells her body in Hunts Point for drugs, mostly heroin. She started crying as she told me her story. "Because of the sexual abuse, sometimes I don't like having sex because it does bother me mentally. But if it's fast, quick money...like I said, I'm homeless. I have nothing. I grew up in a fucked up situation. Because of my father and brother, I'm screwed up in the brain right now. I'm not scared to say what I am and what I do. I see so many prostitutes who deny it. Don't be ashamed of who you are."

The end of the year holiday season can be a huge money suck as people buy gifts for family, friends, and coworkers. But we should also remember to thank the people who make our lives easier throughout the year: building superintendents, babysitters, hairstylists, dog walkers, and a whole host of other people. The question, of course, is how much? We spoke with etiquette expert PatriciaÂ Napier-Fitzpatrick of The Etiquette School of New York to find out more about holiday tipping and gifting. She helpfully broke down her recommendations and advice on who â€” and how much â€” to tip. Park Avenue Documentary"We have to be very good to the service staff in our buildings because they're very good to us,"Â Napier-Fitzpatrick explained to Business Insider. "Take into account how long you've been in the building, how important their service is to you, the frequency of the service, and the quality, plus what you gave last year." Superintendent: $50 â€“ $200 Doorman/Concierge: $50 â€“ $150 Elevator Operator: $25 â€“ $50 Porters/Handymen: $25 â€“ $50 Parking Garage Attendants: $25 â€“ $75 Flickr/belljar77The standard here is to give one week's pay to one month's pay, but it varies by how long they've been with you. "If you've had a nanny for five years, you'd probably give her more than one week's salary,"Â Napier-Fitzpatrick said. "You'd probably give her a month's salary." Housekeeper/Maid: One weekâ€™s pay, or less if not a weekly service Nanny: One week to one monthâ€™s pay, and a smallÂ gift from your child Au Pair: One weekâ€™s pay and a small gift from your child Babysitter: One night's pay, plus a small gift from your child Daily Dog Walker: One dayâ€™s pay Day Care Provider: $25 to $75 each, and a small gift from your child *Teachers/Coaches: Small gift from your child *Childâ€™s Teacher: A small gift from you and one from your child *Coaches/Tutors/Music Teachers: A small gift from your child *Be sure to check with the school before you give cash or gift cards to make sure it's acceptable.Â Napier-Fitzpatrick told us another great way to give back to the teacher is for all parents to get together and get him or her a single gift certificate so that no one parent looks bad. AP/Diane BondareffThis is less mandatory than the first two categories, but if you use a service all year round like a personal trainer or hair stylist, you should give them a little gift. "Most of these people we're tipping all year, so we don't have to go overboard," Napier-Fitzpatrick said. "But at least give them the cost of one service." Hair Stylist/Colorist: The cost of one visit, or a gift equaling that amount Shampoo Person: $10 or a small gift Manicurist/Pedicurist: $15 â€“ $25, or a small gift Massage Therapist: $15, or a small gift Personal Trainer: One sessionâ€™s cost, or a gift equaling that amount Flickr/NinaZedAgain, base these tips on how often you used their services in the past year. Dog Groomer: A fourth or half the cost of one grooming session Newspaper Delivery Person: $25 â€“ $50 or $10 if once a week. Mail Carrier: Gift up to $20 in value (there are legal restrictions on what USPS workers can accept) UPS/FedEx Regular Driver: $20 â€“ $25 Trash Collector: $10 -$20 each. Pool Cleaner: Cost of one cleaning Gardener: One weekâ€™s pay, or less if they work for you occasionally Make sure to put the money in a holiday card and an envelope. "All of the stationary stores today sell money cards, which have a 'Happy Holidays!' message with a nice little pouch for cash," Napier-Fitzpatrick added. You can give a check, but it's best to go to the bank and take out crisp dollar bills. Write a little note, such as: "Thank you for your service throughout the year, we really appreciate you making our lives easier" and sign your name at the bottom. And last but not least, try to give the tip in person. "People appreciate it,"Â Napier-Fitzpatrick said. "It's a personal touch."
Keep your eye on an up-and-coming enterprise startup called Nutanix, which is in the process of raising a huge $100 million round of venture investment, according to documents filed by the company and unearthed by VCExperts. If the company is successful in this raise (and it wouldn't have authorized the shares otherwise), it will have landed $171 million in total funding. That includes a healthy $33 million raised in 2012 from backers includingÂ Lightspeed Venture Partners, Khosla Ventures, Battery Ventures, and Goldman Sachs. Its valuation could be between $800 million to $900 million, VCExperts Justin Byers told Business Insider. Next stop could be an IPO. Nutanix is one of the startups rumored to go public in 2014. Sources close to the company told Business Insider it will have an announcement "soon." Nutanix declined comment. This raise helps Nutanix leapfrog its biggest competitor, SimpliVity, which announced a big investment of its own last month, $58 million. SimpliVity has raised $101 million to date. Both of these companies offer an all-in-one hardware box for corporate data centers that combines a computer server and storage. In Nutanix's case, it uses flash storage from partner Fusion-io. A company can snap together multiple Nutanix boxes and they all work together. If one box needs to store more data than it has room for on its own hard drive, it simply uses a drive attached to another computer. The concept is called "virtualized storage" and it means that companies no longer have to build expensive, separate storage networks with gear from EMC or NetApp. Here's a copy of the form that indicates Nutanix has authorized 13,957,445 preferred shares at $7.2885 per share. 
Oleg Nikishin/Getty Images A few days ago, if you'd said Mikhail Khodorkovsky would be wandering around Berlin today, nobody would have believed you. The jailed Russian oligarch was not expected to be part of Putin's pre-Sochi amnesty that freed other, less consequential, prisoners like the members of Pussy Riot. He had been in prison for more than 10 years, and while he was due to be released next year, there were always rumors that he would face a third trial. But there he is, safely in Germany, a free man again. And now everyone is trying to figure out the Russian government's PR strategy. You can be certain that Vladimir Putin's supposedly off-the-cuff comments about Khodorkovsky's release were carefully planned to maximize effect (as Miriam Elder of Buzzfeed notes, the comments were prompted by a question from a reporter from LifeNews, a tabloid publication close to the Kremlin). By announcing the release of a man widely taken to be his worst enemy in such a casual manner, Putin both made Khodorkovsky seem irrelevant, and presented himself as a benevolent leader: The good tsar. Khodorkovsky's release has overshadowed another Russian legal case — Yevgeny Vitishko, an environmental activist who has reported on the environmental fallout from construction for the $51 billion 2014 Sochi Winter Games, was sentenced today to three years in jail, according to the Associated Press. Even if Putin's amnesty wasn't always designed as a PR move to promote Sochi, that timing would certainly seem fortuitousness. The location of Khodorkovsky's destination also seems relevant. While he had apparently traveled to Berlin to meet his parents (his elderly mother has cancer and had previously been getting treatment in Germany), both his mother and father were actually in Moscow. In the past, Khodorkovsky had indicated that he would stay in Russia after his release, and it's not clear how long he intends to stay in Europe right now. The German authorities have said that former German foreign minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher worked "behind the scenes" to facilitate Khodorkovsky's release. Those with curious minds can't help but wonder if the release of Khodorkovsky might play a role in the fate of two Russian spies discovered in Germany earlier this year. There's even an American angle. The U.S. government was widely expected to add more names to a list of Russian human rights violators this year, commonly referred to as the Magnitsky list, but, according to a report from the Daily Beast's Josh Rogin today, President Barack Obama has ruled out such an action. Of course, it's always tempting to look for grand narratives behind something like this, but it's usually inadvisable, and who knows, maybe all these things are just coincidences. Even so, you have to marvel at a situation where Putin releases his worst enemy from jail and somehow ends up on top again.
Unless Congress acts, an estimated 1.3 million Americans will lose unemployment benefits on Dec. 28 as the Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC) program expires. What does this mean for unemployment in America? JPMorgan's chief U.S. economist Michael Feroli has a note out saying there's evidence to suggest that the expiration of extended unemployment benefits could reduce the unemployment rate. "The state of North Carolina offers a potential testing ground for this thesis," wrote Feroli today. "In July, the North Carolina government decided to no longer offer extended benefits, even though the state still met the economic conditions to qualify for this federal program. Since July, the North Carolina unemployment rate has fallen 1.5%-points; in the same period the national unemployment rate has fallen 0.4%-point." He explains that there are two opposing forces driving this. First is the "employment effect," which results from unemployed folks taking jobs for lower pay than they were waiting for. Second is the "participation effect," which occurs because people just drop out of the workforce. "Limited evidence suggests the participation rate effect might be more important," wrote Feroli. ...Since July the labor force has declined by 0.8% in North Carolina, but fallen by only 0.3% nationally, and the participation rate is down 0.7%-point in North Carolina vs.. 0.4%-point nationally. Over the same time period, employment in North Carolina has grown by 0.8% in the household survey measure and 0.7% in the establishment survey measure; nationally employment is up 0.1% in the household measure and 0.6% in the establishment measure. Thus, in this case it would appear both channels are operative but the participation effect may be more important. EUC, which started in 2008, grants jobseekers up to 99 weeks of compensation while they look for work. Meanwhile, standard unemployment last 26 weeks.Â  JP Morgan
StatigramOzwald Boateng is a genius.At this point you've been to 75,000 holiday parties and worn every last fresh outfit you can think of. Unfortunately, however, the season is not over.

Business Insider/Mike Nudelman (data from Bloomberg) The most important GIF of 2013 shows the recent shift in the eurodollar forward curve.Â Let's talk about what this means. In the past several weeks, traders have been pulling forward expectations for when the Federal Reserve will first hike short-term interest rates from current levels between 0 and 0.25% (where they've been since the financial crisis). This can be seen by looking at eurodollar contracts, which reflect the future expected yield on 3-month dollar deposits outside the United States, and are a popular proxy for ascertaining the market's expectation for when the Fed will hike rates. Where the forward curve crosses above 0.50% is essentially the point at which traders are pricing in the first rate hike from the current 0.25% level. As the GIF shows, the curve has been shifting to the left recently, implying rate hikes sooner rather than later. The green line shows the curve on November 20. That was before a much stronger-than-expected November jobs report (released on December 6), and a spate of other strong economic data releases. The blue line shows the curve on December 18. It had already moved substantially from where it was on November 20 by then, but on December 18, the Fed announced the first tapering of its quantitative easing program. And in the two days since December 18, the curve has shifted even further to the left â€” the red line shows where it stands today. Why is this so important? It captures the essence of the Fed's biggest challenge in the year ahead: how does it keep short-term rates anchored in the face of improving economic data? It also represents the big sea change in how people are thinking about the economy. Rather than assuming that zero interest rates will be here forever, they're realizing that the first hike could come much sooner as everything goes back to normal. If the Fed can't address concerns about a rate hike, markets could be in for a lot of volatility in the year ahead.

Flickr/quintanomediaMarkets have taken off today after a big GDP report this morning. The Dow is up almost 90 points and the S&amp;P 500 is about 12 points higher. According to the BEA'sÂ third and final estimate, third quarter U.S. GDP grew 4.1% at an annualized rate. Economists were looking for a 3.6% print. Personal consumption growth also grew to 2.0% from the previous 1.4% estimate. EvenÂ real final sales growth, often heralded as a more important figure, was revised up to 2.5%Â from last month's tepid estimate of 1.9%.
Guys, it's time to clear up some misconceptions about your suits and how they fit. Why? Because these misconceptions are making you — a. look frumpy, b. spend too much money, c. look cheap, d. look unprofessional. You deserve better. Business Insider reached deep into the souls of men (asked around) to find out what exactly guys think about their suits. What we found shocked us. No, suits do not have to be loose to be comfortable. No, your accessories should not match your suit... no no no. Our friend Judah Estreicher over at JBD Clothiers, a custom suit shop that outfits businessmen and Baltimore Ravens alike, clarified these fallacies for us. Lets walk you through: So get over this and start dressing like an adult.
Dimitrios Kambouris/GettyThe Duck Dynasty.Cable network A&amp;EÂ suspended the star of its mega-hit reality show "Duck Dynasty"Â after the star, Phil Robertson, made some comments in GQ magazine. Robertson, the patriarch of a Louisiana family that has built a fortune off its participation in the show, blasted homosexuality, bestiality, adultery, and other "sins." He also said that black people were perfectly happy under the South's old segregation laws and that he had never personally witnessed any racism. For obvious reasons, these comments infuriated people. And A&amp;E reacted the way most corporations react when someone they are associated with makes comments like these: They condemned the remarks and suspended Robertson. But this action immediately triggered a second outcry. Robertson had merely been expressing his religious beliefs! The bible says that homosexuality is a sin! By suspending Robertson, A&amp;E had effectively insulted all Christians! Sarah Palin quickly capitalized on the opportunity, as did other politicians. A Facebook page that advocated boycotting A&amp;E immediately got more than 900,000 "likes." Meanwhile, the Robertson familyÂ put out a statementÂ saying that it has "spent much time in prayer since learning of A&amp;E's decision" and that Robertson is a God-loving man who is now being punished for "expressing his faith." Although it is amusing to imagine that the newly enriched Robertson family might have been praying that A&amp;E would not cancel the show, the implicit threat was clear: If A&amp;E doesn't reconsider its decision, the family might take its celebrity and viewership elsewhere. So,Â shouldÂ A&amp;E have suspended Robertson? It's obviousÂ whyÂ the network suspended him. (Because the comments presumably offended millions of more tolerant viewers, executives, and advertisers and threatened to cost the network money.) But is suspension really the best response? Might it not be healthier and more helpful for all involved for the A&amp;E to have branded Robertson a closed-minded troglodyte and condemned his remarks... but observed that Duck Dynasty is a "reality show" and let him air his views? The reality, after all, is that lots of people in America â€” including many A&amp;E viewers â€” agree with Robertson. Robertson's comments, in fact, are a real reflection of what the commentatorÂ Josh Barro has described as "two Americas."Â  If these "two Americas" are ever to better understand each other, might it not be better to agree that sunlight is the best disinfectant and just have these conversations openly on a national level? If Robertson is reviled and mocked for his remarks, including on the show, wouldn't this move mutual understanding along? Â Would it not make great reality TV for A&amp;E to follow Robertson around on a media-apology tour in which he is forced to interact with gay people and explain to them why he feels they are "full of murder"? That would certainly make for interesting viewing! In any event, the reality is that, unfortunately, Robertson is expressing views held by tens of millions of Americans. Firing him for expressing those views when he ostensibly works for a "reality show" would seem to be a lost opportunity to move the national dialogue along. Aaron Task and I discussed this issue on Yahoo's Daily Ticker this morning... 
BlackBerry stock is way up today, about 12%, even though the company had a devastating earnings report for last quarter.Â  BlackBerry announced this morning that it had a $4.4 billion net loss last quarter. The company also said it only sold 1.9 million smartphones. So why is the stock way up? The company's new interim CEO, John S.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermidGold has had a nice runup for over a decade now, but it has taken a beating this year. The yellow metal is currently trading at three-year lows. We reached out to commodities expert Jim Rogers for his take on what will happen next in the gold markets. Business Insider: How much lower do you expect gold prices to go? Jim Rogers: I am useless as a market timer/trader. Having said that, a 50% correction is normal in markets so why not in gold? The 12-year rise was an anomaly in markets so the correction may continue to be an anomaly. There will be rallies after big drops, but I expect another opportunity to buy gold.BI: What do you think is behind the sell-off? JR: [1] The anomaly of the 12-year rise, for one thing. [2] India as we have discussed before. Indian politicians are blaming their problems on gold, so [they] have added special taxes, tariffs, controls, and regulations. Pakistan and Bangladesh even totally banned imports of gold at one time. The politicians are now trying to figure out ways to force Indians to sell gold. There are staggering amounts of gold there. The politicians are now trying to hit the temples which have accumulated an unimaginable amount of gold over the centuries. I have no idea if they will succeed at either, but the effort is having an effect. If they are successful to any degree, it will have an even bigger effect. India has been the largest buyer of gold for decades. Cutting back the purchases has already had an effect. IF they can force the largest buyer to become a seller [much less a larger seller], who knows how low gold could go? [3] A lot of people leveraged themselves too which hurts on the downside. Etc., etc.BI. Are you buying gold? If not when would you buy gold? JR: No. I hedged some again a little while ago. ... I wish I knew. Read Business Insider to get answers to questions like that.BI: Do you think the faithful are finally throwing the towel in? JR: No. Most of them are still denying reality saying it cannot happen, etc. They are also blaming it on manipulation still. They did not blame anything on manipulation on the way up, but are now finding all sorts of excuses. [I also find it interesting that I have not seen a single comment from them or anyone else about changes in India â€“ the largest buyer in the world. The whole thing is â€œmanipulationâ€.]
The best hedge funds get in and get out, says a study to be presented by a University of Kentucky professor. Bloomberg reports that finance professor Russel Jame's study has found that the tpo 30% of hedge funds outperform by making short term, contrarian bets. It also finds that 25% of a fund's annual performance occurs a month after a big winning trade. In other words â€” when they score. They score big. From Bloomberg: The winning funds are net buyers of so-called growth stocks, which are those of companies whose earnings are forecast to grow faster than the market average. They also donâ€™t trade more frequently or more profitably prior to corporate earningsâ€™ announcements, undermining any idea that insider trading explains how they make profits. Remember this one, y'all.
Check out this trailer for "The Wolf of Bedford Falls," a parody mash-up of It's a Wonderful Life and The Wolf of Wall Street set to the dulcet tones of Kanye West's "Black Skinhead." Both movies, incidentally, are kind of about banking. Wolf, Martin Scorsese's new flick out Christmas Day, chronicles a 90s-era pump-and-dump scheme, while Frank Capra's classic 1946 film is about the perils of fractional reserve banking and not taking things for granted on Christmas. We first saw the video, from filmmaker Owen Weber, on Kottke. 
REUTERS/ Keith BedfordEric RosengrenThe Federal Reserve surprised the markets on Wednesday when it announced the tapering of its stimulative quantitative easing program. All but one of the members of the Federal Open Market Committee voted in favor of the move. The lone dissenter: Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren. "The U.S. economy remains far from the 5.25 percent unemployment rate that I believe is consistent with full employment, and total PCE inflation, at only 0.7 percent, is well below the Federal Reserve's inflation target of 2 percent," he said. He further warned about the amount of confidence everyone was putting into upgraded economic forecasts. "Over the recovery period, my forecasts, as well as forecasts of many others, have proven to be more optimistic than the actual outcomes," he said. "Furthermore, we remain far from both parts of the Federal Reserve's "dual mandate" on employment and inflation. As a result, I would prefer to wait until the economic improvement that I am forecasting is clearly evident in the data before reducing the size of the asset-purchase program. Given the remaining shortfalls from our targets, I think patience remains appropriate at this time." Here's Rosengren's whole statement: On December 18, 2013 I dissented from the action of the majority of the FOMC because, as the statement issued by the Committee notes, I believe that, "with the unemployment rate still elevated and the inflation rate well below the target, changes in the purchase program are premature until incoming data more clearly indicate that economic growth is likely to be sustained above its potential rate." Further commentary may be useful to illuminate my views and vote. I agree with the Committee's assessment that the economy has been improving, in part as a result of the Federal Reserve's asset purchase program. The national unemployment rate has declined to 7 percent, and recent data on payroll employment indicate that the U.S. economy has been creating close to 200,000 jobs per month. I, too, expect the economy to continue to improve, and my forecast is for real GDP to grow at a rate close to 3 percent next year. Like the Committee, my assessment has brightened in recent months. But, by the same token, I do not yet have sufficient confidence in this outlook to risk the removal of any monetary accommodation at this time. My hope and my forecast is that we will continue to accumulate evidence indicating a strengthening economy in coming months. Thus, my decision to cast a dissenting vote was focused on counseling patience in removing monetary accommodation. The U.S. economy remains far from the 5.25 percent unemployment rate that I believe is consistent with full employment, and total PCE inflation, at only 0.7 percent, is well below the Federal Reserve's inflation target of 2 percent. Many have pointed to temporary factors that have likely suppressed inflation in recent months. As these temporary factors wane, many expect inflation to revert toward the Committee's 2 percent goal. However, the fact that the inflation rate has also been falling in many other developed countries and that core inflation has remained so low throughout this recovery suggests the risk that inflation has been depressed for other reasons, which may be less transitory. Stronger economic growth would likely help to move inflation back toward the Federal Reserve's target more quickly, and I think that is likely next year. But the stronger trajectory is not yet well-established in the economic data. Over the recovery period, my forecasts, as well as forecasts of many others, have proven to be more optimistic than the actual outcomes. Furthermore, we remain far from both parts of the Federal Reserve's "dual mandate" on employment and inflation. As a result, I would prefer to wait until the economic improvement that I am forecasting is clearly evident in the data before reducing the size of the asset-purchase program. Given the remaining shortfalls from our targets, I think patience remains appropriate at this time. Nonetheless, I appreciate the decision of the Committee to recognize the improvements in the economy that have occurred to date, and I am strongly supportive of the new forward guidance that anticipates that the Committee will maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate well past the time that the unemployment rate declines below the 6.5 percent threshold. In my view, a highly accommodative policy remains both necessary and appropriate. Eric S. RosengrenPresident and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of BostonDecember 20, 2013
There are two ways that underground venues die in NYC, and famed 'throw-it-yourself-and-whatever party' space 285 Kent is rumored to be going through one of them. Here's how it goes: 1. The cops go in during the day, find what they need to shut a space down, and the next time you go there to get your party on the doors are shut and the spot is abandoned. 2. There's an announcement from the venue: 'This is our last show for a while. Maybe we'll be back, maybe we won't be back.' After a while, people forget about this news, until they want to get their party on. Then one of your friends, a smart friend, says 'hey what happened to...' Then you all say: 'NOOOOOOO.' Because you realize it's never coming back. 285 Kent is a #2. Gothamist reports that it had its last concert last night. Promoters are saying it's still possible that the party could revive itself in a bit, but no concerts are scheduled for the foreseeable future and NYC has seen this play before. It doesn't usually end well. Here's what 285 Kent was like. 285 Kent was dirty. The floors are concrete and the bathroom is one of the most disgusting holes you've ever been in in your life. There isn't a real bar â€” just a set of tables smashed together with bottles of liquor on top. As such, it's really cheap to drink there. But you do (did) have to pay to get in. That is because 285 Kent hosted some seriously talented musicians from around the country and the world â€” anything from musicians on underground labels like Oakland's Stones Throw Records to legendary house DJs like DJ Nature. It was a regular hang for house heads, dub step fiends, indie rock bands, and kids that generally don't like rules. 285 Kent stayed open late. Naturally this kind of activity has attracted negative attention. I won't name any names but I've known a few DJs that have had to jam out of the space really fast to avoid the cops â€” I know some lighting engineers that weren't fast enough to make it. But it was worth it. People like to do what they want when they can do what they want, in their free time. Sometimes that means dancing until 6 in the morning while drinking whiskey from a bottle that says Jack Daniels but probably isn't Jack Daniels. In New York City this kind of activity can be illegal. You need permits to serve liquor. You need to not bother your neighbors with noise (increasingly a problem in rapidly gentrifying neighborhoods like Williamsburg). You need to pay your rent (increasingly a problem in rapidly gentrifying neighborhoods like Williamsburg â€” this is likely 285 Kent's issue). So this may very well be the end of a stellar space. If it's not, I'm grateful. The party gods have smiled on NYC and given us a few more nights to roll in the mud. If this is true then I'm sorry.
For years, the economic landscape has been dominated by "zero interest rate policy," wherein the Federal Reserve keeps short-term rates near zero in a bid to provide the economy with monetary stimulus — and despite the central bank's best efforts to ensure that this will continue for at least another two years, market participants are increasingly calling this pledge into question as the economy is beginning to show rapid improvement. The release of today's third quarter GDP data revealed that the U.S. economy expanded at a 4.1% annualized rate in Q3, boosted in part by an acceleration in personal consumption growth to 2.0% annualized from Q2's 1.8% rate. "With numbers like these, there will soon be no role for Washington to play in boosting the economy," said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, following the release. "Our call is QE will be history before we hit the spring." Of the some 70 forecasts of economists collected by Bloomberg News between December 6 and December 11, Rupkey's stands out. He predicts the first hike in short-term interest rates by the Fed from current levels between 0 and 0.25% (where they've been since the financial crisis) will come in the third quarter of 2014 — a year before anyone else sees such a move happening. "I am waiting for them [the Fed] to wake up and smell the coffee," he says. "They keep talking down the economy when there is greater strength out there than they think." The consensus on Wall Street is that the first rate hike comes sometime near the end of 2015, and some, like Goldman Sachs economist Jan Hatzius, predict the Fed will refrain from raising rates until 2016. Part of this consensus view is predicated on perceptions of incoming Fed chairman Janet Yellen's dovish policy tilt. She's on record in favoring an "optimal control" approach to monetary policy, which currently dictates that rates should not be raised until sometime in 2016 in order to reduce unemployment faster. Yet the unemployment rate has been dropping fast — it now stands at 7.0%, down from 7.8% a year ago — and is now dangerously close to the 6.5% level the Fed has specified as the "threshold" at which it may begin to consider raising rates. This 6.5% unemployment rate threshold forms the core of the Fed's "forward guidance" strategy, which is meant to offer market participants information on the likely future path of short-term interest rates. Following Wednesday's December Federal Open Market Committee meeting, the Fed's monetary policymaking body announced the first reduction in the pace of monthly bond purchases it makes under its quantitative easing program known as "QE3." The FOMC telegraphed the move in the minutes of its October meeting, which revealed a growing preference on the Committee to move away from QE3 and toward additional forward guidance as its primary means of monetary policy accommodation. The "additional" (or "enhanced," in the words of Fed chairman Ben Bernanke) forward guidance provided by the FOMC on Wednesday was that it would not hike rates until "well past" the time at which the unemployment rate hits 6.5%. Business Insider/Matthew Boesler (data from Bloomberg)Chart 1.Yet short-term interest rates have not responded favorably — at the front (or "short") end of the curve, traders are pulling forward expectations for when the Fed will begin to hike rates. Eurodollar contracts, which reflect the future expected yield on 3-month dollar deposits outside the U.S., are selling off, causing those yields to rise. Chart 1 shows the change in the eurodollar curve from Wednesday's closing levels. "The weakness of the short end comes despite great effort on the part of the Fed to relay an aggressive message that short term rates (fed funds) will remain anchored for a considerable period of time," says Adrian Miller, director of fixed income strategy at GMP Securities. "And yet, after the market had a chance to think about what Chairman Bernanke had to say at his press conference coupled with the opinions of the FOMC members on when the first rate hike may happen as reflected in the SEP, it seems there is a growing consensus that the first hike in the FF may come somewhat earlier than expected. Hence, we are seeing the short end of the curve underperform since mid-day on Thursday." The key question for interest rate markets in 2014, according to Priya Misra, head of U.S. rates strategy at BofA Merrill Lynch, is whether the FOMC will be able to keep the front end of the curve anchored in the face of an improving economy. She, for one, is losing faith in the Committee's ability to do so using forward guidance. "I believe the market will struggle with the credibility of forward guidance in the context of an improving economy," says Misra. "We have never dealt with forward guidance without QE, so QE tapering should weaken the market's perception of forward guidance." That's exactly what appears to be happening already in the wake of the FOMC's decision to announce tapering on Wednesday. And this idea is starting to gain some traction on the Street, despite the FOMC's best efforts. Joachim Fels, chief international economist at Morgan Stanley, flags it as a potential "macro surprise" for 2014. "Many of the major DM central banks (possibly including the BoJ in the future) have moved towards a regime of forward guidance, which has become an important policy tool for a smooth transition from QE towards more conventional policy," says Fels. "One central bank proves unsuccessful in upholding credible forward guidance on interest rates, and this failure is translated around the world to other central banks as well. Forward guidance then increasingly becomes viewed as mere cheap talk and investors lose confidence in central banks' credibility to both support growth and deal with inflation when they need to." In short, an improving economy could present the FOMC with an interesting (and high-stakes) dilemma in 2014. One option is to double down on forward guidance in an attempt to keep short rates anchored. The other is to let the economy and the market guide it in tightening much sooner than it currently appears to be comfortable with — along the lines of Rupkey's forecast. "Starting to think this week's $10 billion taper was too little. Fed may have to be more aggressive next month," said Joe LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank, in a tweet following today's GDP release. We could hear a lot more of that sort of thing from the Street next year.
This photograph of Mikhail Khodorkovsky arriving at Berlin's Schönefeld Airport is the first of him as a free man in more than 10 years. khodorkovsky.ruMikhail Khodorkovsky greets German politician Hans Dietrich Genscher in Berlin It all happened so quickly. Just yesterday, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that the jailed oligarch, perhaps his greatest enemy, was to be pardoned. This morning, the Khodorkovsky camp (who yesterday were saying they knew nothing about his pardon), announced that he was already free. Russia Today reports that he was taken away from his prison camp in Segezha, Republic of Karelia, by helicopter, and that he later boarded a private plane to Germany. According to the Swiss website 20 Minuten, Khodorkovsky will first meet his mother in Germany where they will seek medical treatment, and he will then continue to Switzerland. APAn Emergency Situations Ministry vehicle is parked next to an Emergency Situations Ministry helicopter near the prison where Mikhail Khodorkovsky was kept in Segezha, near Petrozavodsk, Friday, Dec. 20, 2013.  Right now it appears that Khodorkovsky thought his mother was in Germany, where she had been previously for treatment. Khodorkovsky's parents, rather sadly, were shocked when they were told by German reporters that he had landed in Berlin and not Moscow, but they will be traveling soon. It's a remarkable escape for one of the most fascinating characters in Modern Russia. Khodorkovsky was once Russia's richest man but he was arrested in 2003 on charges that many international observers said were politically motivated. Khodorkovsky's official statement on his release is below: Dear friends, On November 12, I asked the President of Russia to pardon me due to my family situation, and I am glad his decision was positive. The issue of admission of guilt was not raised. I would like to thank everyone who has been following the Yukos case all these years for the support you provided to me, my family and all those who were unjustly convicted and continue to be persecuted. I am very much looking forward to the minute when I will be able to hug my close ones and personally shake hands with all my friends and associates. I am constantly thinking of those who continue to remain imprisoned. My special thanks is to Mr.  Hans-Dietrich Genscher  for his personal participation in my fate. First of all I am going to repay my debt to my parents, my wife and my children, and I am very much looking forward to meeting them. I will welcome the opportunity to celebrate this upcoming holiday season with my family. I wish everyone a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year! Mikhail Khodorkovsky
YouTube There's been a growing number of protests and demonstrations at Wal-Mart as workers demand higher wages. So libertarian investor Peter Schiff â€” who believes Wal-Mart is under no obligation to pay its workers a dime more â€” went to Wal-Mart and staged an absurd, fake version of their rally in an attempt to prove his point. Schiff, the founder of Euro Pacific Capital, approached shoppers in the retailer's parking lot and told them he was representing an organization called "15 For 15." He said the organization â€” which doesn't actually exist â€” wants Wal-Mart to raise its prices by 15% to support a $15 minimum hourly wage for workers. In reality, the campaign for higher wages at Wal-Mart, led by the labor group OUR Walmart, is asking the retailer to pay its employees at least $25,000 annually, or $13 an hour. Schiff recorded his stunt on video. He asked Wal-Mart patrons whether they supported higher wages for the retailer's workers, and then demanded that they prove their allegiance by giving him 15% of whatever they spent at Wal-Mart that day. He claimed the money would go to Wal-Mart workers. "Would you contribute 15% of the price of that TV for the Wal-Mart workers?" he shouted at a man who was walking across the parking lot carrying a boxed television. The man declined. "But they are counting on you to pay higher prices!" Schiff yelled. The video was clearly edited, but in every case, the shoppers declined to donate money. Perhaps they didn't support the cause. Perhaps they recognized Schiff was a phony. Watch what happened: 
Today marks the one year anniversary when hedge fund manager Bill Ackman gave a historic 342-slide presentation detailing why he's short Herbalife.   A year ago, Ackman, who runs Pershing Square Capital Management, took the stage at a special Sohn Conference in Midtown Manhattan and slammed Herbalife for being "pyramid scheme" that targets lower income individuals. He's been betting the company will go to $0.  It's his belief that regulators will be persuaded to investigate the company and shut it down.   In the days following the presentation, shares of Herbalife tanked to an all-time low of $26.06. Since the day of the presentation, though, shares of the multi-level marketing company that sells nutritional products have skyrocketed more than 136 percent. The shares are continuing to push higher today into the $81 range hitting a new all-time high of $81.75.  The stock was last trading up more than 2 percent. A handful of hedge fund managers, most notably Ackman's arch-nemesis Carl Icahn, piled on during the last year by going long the stock.  Icahn, who has a huge stake in the company, has said be believes Ackman will be the victim of "the mother of all short squeezes." In early October, Ackman repositioned his $1 billion equity short by swapping about 40 percent of it for put options in an effort to reduce risk.  Despite having hundreds of millions in mark-to-market losses so far, Ackman has continued to remain confident in his short.  He has even said that he will take this to "the end of the earth."   Below is our timeline of events:  Photo illustration by Julia La Roche using Google Finance 
Just a few weeks after the very last Gallardo rolled of the assembly line, Lamborghini has given us our first official look at the car that will take its place: the Huracán. Continuing a tradition, the name comes from a famous bull who fought in Spain in 1879, "showing his unrelenting character and remaining defiant and invincible, thus entering into the legend of fighting bulls' history." No doubt Lamborghini hopes the supercar will do the same. From the photos and details released today, it's off to a good start. The Huracán is designed from scratch, and the first version, the LP 610-4, is powered by a 5.2 liter V10 engine that generates over 600 horsepower. It will go from a dead stop to 62 mph in 3.2 seconds, and top out at 201 mph. In terms of style, it's unmistakably a Lambo, and not a big departure from the looks of the Gallardo. But the supercar market is crowded with excellent offerings from Ferrari, Lamborghini's traditional rival, as well as McLaren, Porsche, and Aston Martin. So we'll have to see how the Huracán handles on the road — and how much it costs — before finding out how it will compete. The Gallardo was introduced at the Geneva show in 2003, and saw a production run of 14,000 units. Those make up half of all Lamborghini cars ever made. The brand new supercar will make its official debut at the Geneva Motor Show in March, but Lamborghini will host private viewing parties for "qualified prospects" starting in January. First deliveries should start in the Spring of 2014. Pricing has not been announced. Lamborghini Lamborghini Lamborghini
Paramount Pictures and Red Granite PictureMartin Scorsese's high-octane biopic The Wolf of Wall Street is a three hour-long, drug and alcohol-infused jaunt through Jordan Belfort's pump-and-dump scam. It's gripping, it's well-acted, and it's funny. But like Michael Corleone in The Godfather, Leonardo DiCaprio's Belfort remains sympathetic throughout his many transgressions (which include fraud, swindling poor people, and hitting his wife). That's of course more "entertaining" than documenting the financial strain of his thousands of victims (who in total lost about $100 million in the scheme), but the New York Times' Susan Antilla took the time to tell the story of a few of them. From the Times: Dr. Alfred E. Vitt, a retired dentist in Heath, Tex., who lost $250,000, described a typical strategy that Stratton brokers used. “They started off selling me good stocks, but it wasn’t long before I didn’t know what they were doing,” he said. After Dr. Vitt had made a quick profit on a blue-chip company, his broker moved on to sell him penny stocks that regulators would later deem to have been manipulated by Stratton. “It started to cost me more and more,” Dr. Vitt said. “I finally just said ‘no’ and they became downright hostile.” Sometimes a second broker would join in on a phone conversation to help bully Dr. Vitt into making a purchase. “I had to struggle for a while to make ends meet” after losing so much money, he said. The film is based on the real life Belfort's autobiography, so it's obviously going to tell his own story of Wall Street glitz and excess. Still, it's important to remember what the guy actually did to land himself in jail. Read the full report at the New York Times »

REUTERS/Eliseo FernandezWhy?Wall Street's precious metals analysts have gone gloomy on gold. Especially in the wake of the Federal Reserve's announcement to begin tapering its stimulative asset purchase program, experts think it'll only get worse as the Fed eventually begins to tighten monetary policy in coming years. "We expect gold to continue to fall as better data from the US continues to see interest rates rise, causing reduced demand for non-yielding gold," wrote Goldman Sachs' Eugene King. "We expect outflows from ETFs to continue and a reduced rate of central bank buying. Better jewellery demand on a lower price and physical buying of bar and coin in India and China, in our view, will be insufficient to support the price. We forecast gold at US$1,144/oz in 2014." Gold fell to $1,188 on Thursday, the lowest level since August 2010. Yesterday, UBS's precious metals analysts made similar comments. And even earlier this week it was Barclays.
FlickrToday's third and final revision of third-quarter GDP was a monster.  And the report showed that the economic recovery is being driven by real people actually buying stuff. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the economy surged 4.1% in the third quarter, which was much higher than the previous estimate of 3.6%. Economists are often quick to look at how inventories contributed to GDP. Indeed, last month saw a massive 1.7 percentage point contribution from inventory adjustments. So, real final sales — GDP growth less inventory changes — is considered a more reliable measure of economic health. Even this number looked good. Real final sales growth was revised up to 2.5% from last month's weak estimate of 1.9%. This was largely driven by personal consumption growth, which was revised up to 2.0% from 1.4%. Bloomberg Briefs economist Rich Yamarome has previously warned that a real final sales growth number below 2.0% portends a recession. Perhaps today's real final sales number suggests this recovery is for real.
REUTERS/Chip EastA model poses for an impromptu photo shoot on the steps of Federal Hall, in front of the New York Stock Exchange.The third and final estimate of third quarter U.S. GDP by the Bureau of Economic Analysis is out. GDP grew 4.1% at an annualized rate in the third quarter, according to the estimate. Economists predicted growth of 3.6%, in line with the second estimate published by the BEA earlier this month. Personal consumption growth surged to 2.0% from the previous 1.4% estimate. The GDP price index came in at 2.0%, as expected, while core PCE was 1.4%, slightly below the previous 1.5% estimate. A buildup in inventories contributed 1.7% to GDP growth in Q3, unchanged from the previous estimate (private businesses increased inventories $115.7 billion in the third quarter, following increases of $56.6 billion in the second quarter and $42.2 billion in the first.) "The key takeaway from this report is simply that the underlying momentum in U.S. economic activity has shifted up a gear in Q3," says Millan Mulraine, deputy head of U.S. research and strategy at TD Securities. "While much of the gain in overall activity was due to inventory accumulation (accounting for 1.7 percentage points), the strengthening in domestic consumption and investment activity points to a more constructive narrative on economic activity that previously thought." Below is a summary of the data from the BEA: Real gross domestic product -- the output of goods and services produced by labor and propertyÂ located in the United States -- increased at an annual rate of 4.1 percent in the third quarter of 2013 (thatÂ is, from the second quarter to the third quarter), according to the "third" estimate released by the BureauÂ of Economic Analysis. In the second quarter, real GDP increased 2.5 percent. The GDP estimate released today is based on more complete source data than were available forÂ the "second" estimate issued on December 5, 2103. In the second estimate, the increase in real GDP wasÂ 3.6 percent (see "Revisions" on page 3). With this third estimate for the third quarter, increases inÂ personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and in nonresidential fixed investment were larger thanÂ previously estimated. The increase in real GDP in the third quarter primarily reflected positive contributions fromÂ private inventory investment, PCE, nonresidential fixed investment, exports, residential fixedÂ investment, and state and local government spending that were partly offset by a negative contributionÂ from federal government spending. Imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP,Â increased. The acceleration in real GDP growth in the third quarter primarily reflected an acceleration inÂ private inventory investment, a deceleration in imports, and accelerations in state and local governmentÂ spending and in PCE that were partly offset by a deceleration in exports.

Rob Wile/Business InsiderFrom Citi FX analyst Steven Englander: Now that the tedium of the Fed tapering discussion is over, we can go back to what everyone is really interested in â€“ Bitcoin. One question that keeps popping up is whether all the elements of the current Bitcoin are necessary for a viable alternative currency. Â And if they are not, or can be improved on, where does that leave Bitcoinâ€™s first mover advantage?Â  The libertarian streak in me likes the anonymity of Bitcoin transactions, but thereÂ  is a rational part of me that asks whether that aspect is essential if I am paying for a latte in Soho.Â  Similarly if the Bitcoin wallet can be made more secure by dropping Â anonymity, how many transactors will give up transactional security for libertarian principle? Giving up anonymity may make Bitcoin transactions more secure, and I suspect almost all transactors will value security much more than anonymity. The rest of the note is a further discussion about whether Bitcoin can give up some of its more problematic aspects while still being a new and important innovation. But mostly we just thought that first sentence was really funny.

Earlier this month, we learned that GDP growth spiked to 3.6% at an annualized pace in Q3. However, this was largely driven by a spike in inventories, which added a whopping 1.7 percentage points to the headline growth number. Inventory gives and eventually inventory adjustments taketh away from GDP. This is why economists often emphasize real final sales, the GDP growth metric that excludes inventory. During the period, real final sales growth slipped to just 1.9% from 2.1% in Q2. This is not a good sign according to Bloomberg Briefs economist Rich Yamarone. "When the year-over-year change in the level of real final sales falls below 2.0%, the economy eventually slips into recession," he said to Business Insider. This is such a concern that Yamarone told Business Insider that this was the most important chart of the year. Business Insider

REUTERS/Jason LeeStudents hold each other for warmth as they sleep during a break in between high intensity training at Tianjiao Special Guard/Security Consultant camp on the outskirts of Beijing December 1, 2013.Good morning. Here's what you need to know.
REUTERS/Ho NewJanet Yellen sworn in as Federal Reserve board governor, October 4, 2010.SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - By ensuring the Federal Reserve begins trimming its massive bond-buying stimulus before a more hawkish contingent of voters comes on board next year, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has greased the skids politically for his successor, Janet Yellen. The U.S. central bank's decision on Wednesday to begin to cut the pace of its monthly purchases by $10 billion, to $75 billion, gave the Fed's bond-buying skeptics what they wanted: a roadmap out of a policy they felt risked fueling future inflation. Barring an unexpected downturn, Bernanke told reporters at his last news conference as chairman that the central bank would likely end the bond-buying by late 2014. The delicate policy change effectively shifts the Fed from an era of extraordinary stimulus to one of slowing the money presses and eventually starting to shrink the central bank's nearly $4 trillion balance sheet. For Yellen, it could neutralize potential opposition from regional Fed presidents who opposed the stimulus program and who rotate into voting spots on the Fed's policy panel next year, giving her some breathing room to acclimatize. "She'll now have a clean policy slate - she won't have to worry about making her first policy decision be to taper," said Millan Mulraine at TD Securities. "It will be a much easier regime for her, because it's now a matter of steady-as-she-goes policy." The Senate is expected to hold a test vote on Friday and a confirmation vote on January 6 to hand Yellen the reins at the Fed after Bernanke's second four-year term as chairman expires on January 31. Financial markets, ever sensitive to the utterances of the Fed chief, could be especially jittery as investors get used to Yellen's style of leadership and communication. Further complicating things, at least three seats at the seven-member Fed board will need to be filled in the new year, presuming Bernanke steps down when his chairmanship ends, as is widely expected. Back in May, the mere hint from Bernanke that the central bank could soon start to slow its bond buying sent bonds and stocks into a tailspin. Long-term borrowing costs rose so quickly that the Fed had to put its plan on hold and redouble efforts to convince markets that interest rates would stay low for a long while even if the purchase pace slowed. This week's decision reduced such headaches. "I do think the decision ... will help ease the transition for the new chair," said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago. "This was a step in the right direction." Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher and Philadelphia Fed chief Charles Plosser rotate into voting slots on the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee next year. Both have been vocal opponents of the bond-buying program, and both have a record of expressing their opposition to policies in the form of dissent. In addition, Cleveland Fed President Sandra Pianalto, who is usually seen as a centrist but who wanted the Fed to scale back its purchases earlier this year, also takes a voting spot. While she has announced plans to step down early in 2014, she has said she will serve until a successor is named. Admittedly, another vocal hawk - Esther George of the Kansas City Fed - loses her vote, and is replaced by dovish Narayana Kocherlakota of the Minneapolis Fed. But taken together, the ranks of officials who would prefer to normalize policy sooner rather than later will have their hands strengthened. They can be counted on to keep the pressure on Yellen to stick to the timetable Bernanke laid out. As long as she does, outright dissent is unlikely. To have already begun the process of tapering asset purchases "takes the heat and pressure off Yellen as she embarks on her chairmanship," said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco. At his news conference, Bernanke emphasized that the decision on bond buying does not mean the Fed is getting close to raising benchmark overnight rates, which it has held near zero since late 2008. He said the Fed would hold them steady until well after the unemployment rate falls to 6.5 percent. It stood at 7 percent last month. That is especially so, he said, if inflation remains below the Fed's 2 percent target. Futures traders took Bernanke at his word, betting there would be no rate hike until the second half of 2015. It's a message that Yellen will continue to hammer home. "I'm sure she agrees that, given increasingly worrisome low inflation numbers, that the Fed needs to maintain an expansionary stance even if it decides to slow down its portfolio expansion," said Bob Hall, a Stanford economics professor. "It can only help her to have this be the Fed's posture before she takes over." The Fed's decision to taper has already muted hawkish sentiment, with Kansas City's George supporting the Fed's decision after a string of dissents at every other policy meeting this year. "There was a little bit of a concern that if taper didn't start, that you could get a little bit of a tense environment as Janet started," said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at Chicago-based Northern Trust. The more dissents, he said, the less the market may trust that the Fed will stick with its decisions. For the wind-down of bond-buying to be a success, he said, "there have to be as few surprises as possible."

However, they share one thing in common in that both recently made transactions in their own stock. FB has ‘A’ and ‘B’  shares, whose rights are identical other than ‘B’ shares have 10 votes each and can be converted 1:1 into ‘A’ shares. Mark Zuckerberg is exercising an option to buy 60 million B shares and then converting them into ‘A’ shares prior to selling 41.35 million in an upcoming secondary offering.   He says he’ll use most of the proceeds to pay taxes but will still wind up controlling 56.1% of the voting power (compared with 58.8% before the sale) and will have greatly reduced his tax liability since he’ll net $2.2 billion pre-tax with virtually unchanged ownership. Meanwhile, Rich Kinder recently spent $27 million buying shares in KMI, bringing his holdings to 231 million worth about $8 billion. You can invest alongside Rich Kinder, but you can’t buy the ‘B’ shares that Zuckerberg owns. Who would you rather be in business with? We own KMI. Read more posts on In Pursuit of Value »
We recently published our big Most Important Charts Of The Year chartbook, wherein we asked the top minds on Wall Street to tell us the one chart they deemed to be really important.Â We've also been breaking some of charts out separately because they are particularly important or very popular. Through two particular charts you can really see why people are hopeful that 2014 is the year the economy breaks out. The first chart is this one, which shows that in 2013 for the first time, the household deleveraging cycle came to an end, and households began to add credit again. St. Louis Fed It's popular to decry credit, and to think that credit growth is somehow bad, but that's nonsense. There's very little hope for real growth if households keep reducing credit, and there's nothing wrong with adding credit so long as it's not going up way faster than overall GDP. So the growth of credit is a clear positive for the economy. The other chart, and it's closely related, comes from Goldman's Jan Hatzius. It shows that in 2014, the fiscal drag is going to come to an end, as there are no fresh new austerity measures or fiscal cliffs in the cards. Goldman Sachs So the story is: Finally US households are done deleveraging, and finally the government isn't going to kick the economy in the gut with austerity. Now let's hope the story comes true.
This is important. For a little while there this year it looked like housing might be sputtering a bit. According to Goldman, that's over: Recent data on housing sector activity have on balance been firmer, following the soft patch earlier this year. We see the dataflow as consistent with growing momentum in the housing sector, in line with our view that higher interest rates will not prevent a solid increase in housing activity in 2014. Our housing current activity indicatorâ€•a summary measure of eight housing activity seriesâ€•has risen substantially from its August low. Forward-looking and coincident data such as the NAHB Housing Market Index, housing starts, and new home sales have led the way. Goldman Sachs
A rise in China's interbank interest rates on Friday showed that markets remain uneasy despite a cash injection by China's central bank, said dealers. The rates, which serve as the funding costs for pricing and investment, have been trending higher in recent weeks as the People's Bank of China (PBoC) had recently refrained from injecting further liquidity before Thursday's move. On Friday the seven-day repurchase rate -- a benchmark for interbank borrowing costs -- rose to 7.75 percent from Thursday's close at 7.06 percent, said Dow Jones Newswires. That came despite the People's Bank of China (PBoC) announcing before market close that it had "appropriately injected" an unspecified amount of cash into the market. The measure followed a spike in the seven-day rate to 9.8 percent earlier in the day, the highest since a cash crunch in June that unnerved global markets. Before Thursday's intervention, the central bank had for the past two weeks suspended a routine move to release liquidity -- owing to fears about a growth of bad debt that could weigh on the economy. But that sent jitters across the market, with big banks scrambling to increase their cash reserves as they struggled to meet regulatory requirements on capital by year's end, sending up interest rates that lenders charge to lend to each other, analysts said. This prompted the central bank to step in on Thursday by conducting short-term liquidity operations (SLOs) to inject cash. "If necessary... (authorities) will continue to provide liquidity support to qualified financial institutions via SLO," it said on its account on Sina Weibo, a Chinese equivalent of Twitter. Analysts said the move showed that the central bank intended to soothe market fears about a recurrence of the liquidity crunch in June, which sparked worries over China's slowing economic growth as lenders cut loans to companies. "The PBoC learned the lesson in June and it will surely avoid playing with fire again," Lu Ting and Zhi Xiaojia, Bank of America Merrill Lynch's economists in Hong Kong, said. ANZ economists Liu Ligang and Zhou Hao called for further measures to lower the market interest rate and restore confidence. "We believe the central bankâ€™s intervention is necessary and timely," they said.
I really liked this concise view on investing mistakes to avoid via Ben Carlons atÂ A Wealth of Common Sense: The Bill Russell investment strategy is about avoiding the crippling mistakes that so many investors make on a consistent basis. Hereâ€™s my list of the biggest mistakes to avoid:
Most world markets are pretty flat today. But Shanghai got slammed. It fell 2%. Bloomberg The big story there is rising interest rates and fears about a credit seize up. Over the last year there have been a few waves of this story. China is on pace to end the year the red, which is pretty unusual for 2014.
Flickr via nanoprobe67It's been a huge week for markets with tons of implications. The big event this week was on Wednesday when the Fed unexpectedly "tapered" and the market unexpectedly surged. Then yesterday markets went nowhere, and gold got crushed. And now today nothing is really happening on any front, at least so far. China did get fall 2% last night, as concerns about a liquidity crisis there grow. But other than that, things are quiet.
REUTERS/Aly SongWhile the Fed's decision to taper back its monthly asset purchase program to $75 billion has received a lot of attention, many have overlooked the news out of China.  The seven-day repurchase rate was up to a six-month high of 7.6% in Shanghai on Friday. It closed at 7.06% on Thursday. The People's Bank of China [PBoC] injected money through short-term liquidity operations on Thursday. We already saw a severe credit crunch in China back in June, and some are worried that we're going to see a repeat of that. Hedge fund manager Jim Chanos described this week's run up in money market rates as "a bit of a banking crisis," in a CNBC interview. Patrick Chovanec of Silvercrest Asset Management tweeted that China's banks have "huge off balance sheet cash obligations like wealth management products that come due and they "rely on continued injections of new cash to stay liquid, otherwise they default." But why are rates rising now? China's move to let the market determine interest rates and not conduct reverse repos have weighed on liquidity. "One theory which could quickly attract audience for its simplicity is that the omnipotent PBoC intentionally guided interbank rates higher to force banks and their clients to deleverage," writes Bank of America's Ting Lu. "The People's Bank of China [PBoC] knew that the bottom-up interest rate liberalization pushed up short-end rates and bond yields, so even Shibor rose, credit growth remains high (such as the case in November). If the PBoC wants to contain credit growth, it’s forced to allow interbank rates to rise." Ting characterizes this as some confusion on the part of the central bank and writes that "with its limited predictability of flows and its insensitivity to market reactions, the PBoC finds it much more likely than before to make operation mistakes." Many argue that the central bank's efforts to impose discipline haven't been fruitful. "With its limited predictability of flows and its insensitivity to market reactions, the PBoC finds it much more likely than before to make operation mistakes," writes Ting. The Shanghai Composite is down 1.65%.
