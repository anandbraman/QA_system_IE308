JCPenney has expanded its borrowing capacity by $100 million, upping its total to $1.85 billion, Evan Clark at Women's Wear Daily reported. It's a nice little extra financial cushion as the department store chain attempts its transformative turnaround attempt under CEO Ron Johnson. JCPenney hasn't dipped into the facility yet. â€œAs we enter the second year of our transformation, todayâ€™s announcement reflects the confidence of our banking group in our long-term strategy and further strengthens our liquidity position as we continue to execute our plan,â€ CFO Ken Hannah told WWD. Johnson addressed the issue in an interview on CNBC last week. "We'll do it with the cash we haveÂ on hand," said Johnson.Â "We've yet to tap into theÂ revolver."  "Doesn't mean we wouldn't at someÂ point, but we haven't done it inÂ the first year," he continued.Â "We said we'd end the year withÂ about a billion dollars in cash.Â In a couple weeks we tell peopleÂ exactly where we ended up.Â Our teams did a great jobÂ managing our cash during thisÂ transformation."

Phil Denton / Creative CommonsThe New York Times' John Broder has responded to Tesla CEO Elon Musk's point-by-point response to his review of the company's Model S car, and basically says Tesla's own employees instructed him to do everything Musk took him to task for: Beginning early in the morning of my second day with the car, after the projected range had dropped precipitously while parked overnight, I spoke numerous times with Christina Ra, Teslaâ€™s spokeswoman at the time, and Ted Merendino, a Tesla product planner at the companyâ€™s headquarters in California. They told me that the loss of battery power when parked overnight could be restored by properly â€œconditioningâ€ the battery, a half-hour process, which I undertook by sitting in the car with the heat on low, as they instructed. That proved ineffective; the conditioning process actually reduced the range by 24 percent (to 19 miles, from 25 miles). Broder goes on to provide his own point-by-point response to Musk's allegations. Check it out at NYTimes.com &gt;
YouTubeMichael HartnettBofA Merrill Lynch investment strategist Michael Hartnett (of "Great Rotation" fame) identifies seven things that could be a dealbreaker for the never-ending risk rally in his latest note to clients: The biggest risk to investor positioning right now is any event that causes data, yields or volatility to break out of their recent trading ranges. The big 2013 risks remain a Bond Crash (in France or the US), a Currency War (between Japan, Europe and EM) or inflation. In coming weeks we would watch the following: 1. US labor market. The most likely reason for a big sell-off in US Treasuries would be acceleration in jobs growth to +250K in payrolls. Watch small business hiring intentions (SBOIHIRE Index) as a lead indicator (as was the case in late- 1993).  2. The 2.25-2.3% level on 10-year US Treasuries, which if breached could cause mortgage convexity to kick-in and send yields significantly and quickly higher, according to Rates Strategist Priya Misra.  3. Oil. Energy prices have quietly risen of late. A further $10/b rally in WTI to above $105/b &amp; in Brent to above $125/b (note Brent in yen terms is at 4 year high) could dampen economic activity in Q2.  4. Inflation breakeven levels. With labor markets slack and output gaps large the likelihood of inflation is low. So why are breakeven levels close to 5-year highs? Should QE, FX devaluations and higher oil prices combine and cause a breakout in breakevens bonds would react negatively.  5. Chinese exports. Thus far Asian export growth has been resilient despite poor activity data and the Japanese yen devaluation. And China, ironically, has become one of the few major countries that is not manipulating its currency lower. That could change if Chinese export growth suddenly slows. And if China needs a weaker FX, the probability of a risk-negative currency war grows heralded by a sharp drop in ADXY.  6. Will France recover before Germany slows, or vice-versa? Their respective PMIs will tell the Q2 tale.  7. Bonds and Currencies. Sometimes it is the relationship between the two asset classes that matters. If the US fiscal tightening starts to bite look for for Treasury yields to fall and the dollar to rise. If the European story deteriorates once again, look for French yields to rise and the Euro to fall. If the Japanese are really to rid their economy of deflation, then look for the yen to fall until JGB yields start to rise. BAML technical analyst Mary Ann Bartels wrote in a separate client note that calls for a correction in the market are becoming consensus, which could postpone the actual selloff. If it happens relatively soon, she says, it could be a 3-5 percent correction. If it gets pushed off for a few more weeks, however, Bartels sees a pullback on the order of 5-10 percent. For his part, Hartnett writes, "even assuming volatility stays low and the macro remains in a trading range, the best outcome is for equities and other risk assets is to grind higher in coming months."

www.imdb.com"The large operator does not, as a rule, go into a campaign unless he sees in prospect a movement of from 10 to 50 points. Livermore once told me he never touched anything unless there were at least 10 points in it according to his calculations." So writes Richard Wyckoff, the legendary trader who in the 1930s wrote a manifesto that gained him a cult following on Wall Street. His 1931 book, "The Richard D. Wyckoff Method of Trading and Investing in Stocks – A Course of Instruction in Stock Market Science and Technique," is out of print and somewhat difficult to find these days (not impossible), but even in 2013, hedge fund managers still swear by it. One of the key takeaways from the book is that if you want to succeed, you have to learn to recognize the professionals and understand what they are doing. That's what those who follow Wyckoff do — they watch the large operators. Wyckoff walks us through the process of how a large operator will manipulate a stock up or down — so that next time one sees it unfolding on the screen before his or her own eyes, he or she can react accordingly.

The battle has become a he-said, she-said affair, with both sides accusing the other of dirty tricks. Regardless of who's right, the whole experience reveals why today's all-electric cars are, for all intents and purposes, dead on arrival: Because they're not that useful for one of the key uses that most would-be car-owners would want to use them for -- the ability to comfortably, conveniently, and reliably transport oneself from city to city without living in fear that the battery will die and leave car and driver stranded. New York Times John Broder's account of trying to drive from Washington to New York and then to Connecticut reveals how even a routine trip can be transformed into a stressful, uncomfortable, time-consuming hassle while driving an all-electric car. Despite having direct, real-time help from Tesla, Broder's car forced him to start worrying and conserving energy (turning down the heat, traveling slowly, "conditioning the battery," etc.) long before he reached his destination. And, in the end, he didn't reach it, because the car ran out of power and shut down. This problem (and fear), importantly, is unique to all-electric cars. Gas-powered cars do occasionally run out of gas, but gas is readily available and doesn't require hours of recharging time to pump it into the car. "Hybrid" cars, meanwhile, which run on batteries sometimes, and gas-powered engines at other times, have a similarly infinite range — but they still benefit from the "greenness" and efficiency that is the primary selling point of electric cars.  They're just not as novel, or cool. (Or expensive). "Hybrid," propulsion, in fact, is clearly the winner in the current generation of efficient cars: Once one understands the convenience of having a gas engine available to charge a car's battery and extend its range, it seems preposterous to handicap the car by limiting its power to only a battery. Regardless of whom you believe in the Tesla-NYT spat, you cannot help but observe this flaw: Almost all the way from Washington DC to New York to Connecticut — a relatively short-haul trip for those accustomed to the simplicity, reliability, and convenience of modern cars — Broder was worried about running out of power. When his situation became critical, the Tesla began barking at him, ordering him to stop to recharge the battery immediately. No normal driver accustomed to the freedom of driving a gas-powered or hybrid car would never voluntarily subject themselves to that. They would either buy an all-electric car only for tooling around their neighborhoods or cities — or, with uber-rich drivers, for impressing their friends with a gorgeous, unusual, and sexy rich person's toy. And the latter is what today's Teslas are. They're amazing machines. Awesome to look at, cool to show off, and awesome to drive. But no normal driver looking for a means of reliable, flexible, and convenient transportation would buy one as their primary vehicle, especially with gas still being so relatively cheap. And that means that, for their owners, Teslas and other all-electric cars will be second or third (or fourth or fifth or sixth) cars. Hopefully, in the future, battery technology and electric-car-infrastructure will advance to the point where all-electric cars have essentially infinite ranges, charging stations will be everywhere, and the cars can be charged immediately and conveniently, with a quick stop for "gas." Or, maybe, electric car companies like Tesla will introduce super-cheap, super-convenient models that are designed to be used primarily for getting around town (and are priced for that convenience). Either of those things would significantly improve the value proposition of today's all-electric cars--and, thereby, make them more useful. And at that point the decision would come down to the price-value tradeoff. (A tradeoff that is very important for people who can't afford to just buy an all-electric car as a toys.) Until those things happen, though — all-electric cars will remain what they are today: Curiosities and toys. None of which is to say that Tesla isn't an amazing success story (it is), or that, for those who can afford a $100,000+ third or fourth car, Teslas aren't awesome. They are. UPDATE: Some readers have interpreted this post as my saying that "Tesla sucks" or "Tesla is toast." I'm not saying either of those things. I do think Tesla owes the New York Times an apology for calling its review "fake," but Tesla's an amazing company, and, for those who can afford to buy their cars as accessories, their cars are awesome. This market--folks who can afford  cool curiosities--is big enough to support Tesla, at least until people get bored of the idea of battery-powered cars. My point is broader: Battery technology, charging infrastructure, and the cost of gas have not yet reached the point where an all-electric car is an attractive option for normal drivers. For most people, the benefits don't justify the price. Hopefully, someday, they will.
Wow. Minutes ago, Carl Icahn revealed a massive 12.98 percent stake in Herbalife, and the stock is surging. Here's the after-hours chart from MarketWatch. MarketWatch
GettyBillionaire investor Carl Icahn has disclosed a massive stake in Herbalife equal to 12.98%, 14,015,151 shares,Â according to an SEC filing. "The Reporting Persons intend to have discussions with management of the IssuerÂ regarding the business and strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value, such as a recapitalization or a going-private transaction," the filing states. Icahn told CNBC's Scott Wapner that he's done a great deal of research on the company and he doesn't think that it's a pyramid scheme.Â  Herbalife is the stock that Icahn's decade-long rival Bill Ackman, the CEO of $12 billion Pershing Square Capital Management,Â is shorting. Â Ackman, who is shorting more than 20 million shares, believes that the company is a "pyramid scheme" and has a price target of $0. Just last month, the two hedge fund titans, who have been fighting for a decade,Â duked it out on CNBC in a live telephone interview with Icahn hurling brutal insults at Ackman. Â  The stock is soaring on the Icahn news. Â Herbalife is up 18.11%, or $45.20 per share, in after-hours trading. That's above the pre-Ackman short level.Â

Bloomberg, Business Insider It will come as no surprise to anyone engaged in stock markets these days that the last two weeks have been incredibly slow. What may come as a surprise (as it did to us) is that the over the past two weeks, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has stayed in its tightest trading range in more than 26 years (Bespoke Investment Group pointed this out). The chart above shows the spread between the highest intraday level on the DJIA over the lowest level on a 13-day rolling basis. Unfortunately, the data only go back to January 1, 1987 â€“ but we can at least conclusively say that over the past two weeks, we've seen the tightest trading range since December 1986. (There are a few times on the chart when the spread went north of 20 percent, but we zoomed in to show you the dynamics at the bottom of the chart.) (h/t Bespoke Investment Group)

APSenate Democrats have presented their official plan to avoid the sequester, unveiling a bill Thursday that would replace the across-the-board budget cuts for 10 months.  The bill, called the American Family Economic Protection Act, includes $110 billion in savings, balanced evenly with spending cuts and new revenues. The plan would raise approximately $54 billion in revenues by implementing of the so-called "Buffett Rule," which sets a minimum 30 percent tax rate on income above $1 million. This proposal has so far been a non-starter among Senate Republicans, who moved to block debate on similar Buffett Rule legislation last April.  The new bill would also raise nearly $2 billion in revenue by closing loopholes in the tax code for oil companies, and about $1 billion by ending tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas.  Of the spending cuts, approximately $27.5 billion would come from the defense budget, while the other $27.5 billion would come from agriculture funding. While its unlikely that Senate Democrats will get the five Republican votes they need to avoid a filibuster, the legislation is the first attempt the Senate has made to replace the sequester.  Earlier Thursday, Republican House Speaker John Boehner slammed Senate Democratic leaders for their inaction, and said he would not act on the sequester unless the Senate moved first. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney released a statement saying the White House would support the measure. "Now, Republicans in Congress face a simple choice. Do they protect investments in education, health care and national defense or do they continue to prioritize and protect tax loopholes that benefit the very few at the expense of middle and working class Americans?" Carney said in the statement. Here's the outline of the full bill: American Family Economic Protection Act The American Family Economic Protection Act would eliminate through January 2, 2014, any of the deep, across-the-board spending cuts known as “sequestration.”  These cuts, if left in place, would threaten thousands of jobs and weaken the economic security of America’s middle class.  These cuts would also would kick 70,000 children off of Head Start, reduce loan guarantees to small businesses, cut food inspections, and result in 1,000 fewer law enforcement agents, among other effects.   Although it would eliminate sequestration for the remainder of 2013, the American Family Economic Protection Act would not increase our long-term deficit.  All costs would be fully offset in a balanced way.  Fifty percent of the costs would be offset with other spending cuts, divided equally between defense and non-defense programs.  The other 50 percent of costs would be offset with new revenue generated by adopting the Buffett Rule — which ensures millionaires cannot pay a smaller share of their income in taxes than typical middle-class families — along with other provisions that would eliminate an oil industry tax loophole and deny deductions to companies that ship jobs overseas.   The bill’s major provisions include:   Defense Savings The American Family Economic Protection Act fully protects the Defense Department, like other Federal agencies, from sequestration until January 2, 2014.  Throughout 2013, no sequester would be implemented, and the existing limits on security-related spending would continue to apply.   Twenty-five percent of the overall costs of suspending sequestration would be offset by very modest reductions in the overall level of defense spending in the future.  These reductions would total $27.5 billion, or 0.5 percent of defense spending between Fiscal Years 2013 and 2021.  The reductions would not begin until Fiscal Year 2015, when the war in Afghanistan is expected to end.    The cuts would be spread out in relatively modest increments over 7 years, through Fiscal Year 2021, and would allow defense spending to increase by at least two percent in each of those years, even after the reduction.  The reduction would be about $3 billion in Fiscal Years 2015 and 2016, and then would rise slowly to a high of about $5 billion in Fiscal Year 2021.    Agriculture Savings    The American Family Economic Protection Act saves $27.5 billion over 10 years by cutting farm subsidies and extending certain Farm Bill programs that were left out of the recent Farm Bill extension.    The bill ends direct payments, which are currently provided regardless of yields, prices, or farm income.  This provision saves approximately $31 billion.  Of that total, $27.5 billion is used for deficit reduction.  The remaining $3.5 billion is used to pay for the extension of Farm Bill programs that were left without funding, including renewable energy, rural development, disaster assistance, conservation, hunger prevention, agriculture research, organic certification, and specialty crop programs.  The Buffett Rule   The American Family Economic Protection Act would adopt the Buffett Rule, which would ensure that wealthy taxpayers cannot pay tax at a lower effective tax rate than middle class families.  The bill applies the Buffett Rule to taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes greater than $1 million — after subtracting charitable contributions — who are paying less than a 30 percent average tax rate in combined income tax, alternative minimum tax, and the employee’s portion of the payroll tax.  Specifically, the Act would require these taxpayers to pay a 30 percent tax on all of their adjusted gross income (less charitable contributions), phased in between $1 million and $2 million.  This provision would reduce the deficit by approximately $54 billion over 10 years.   Ending Tax Breaks for Shipping Jobs Overseas    The American Family Economic Protection Act eliminates a tax break that encourages companies to ship job overseas.   Companies may generally deduct ordinary and necessary business expenses.  Under current law, these can include the cost of shipping equipment overseas, terminating leases, and other expenses associated with moving a business offshore.  The legislation would deny tax deductions for outsourcing costs — the costs of relocating a U.S. business unit to a foreign country.  This provision would reduce the deficit by less than $1 billion.   Closing an Oil Industry Tax Loophole   The American Family Economic Protection Act eliminates a special tax loophole now enjoyed by the oil industry.  Specifically, the Act would include oil from tar sands among the petroleum products that are subject to taxes that support the oil spill liability trust fund.    In January of 2011, the IRS determined that the definition of crude oil for purposes of the oil spill liability trust fund does not include tar sands or oil sands.  Yet there is no good reason for this special exclusion.  Tar sands are refined using the same processes as those used in the refining of crude oil, and oil spill liability trust fund revenues are used to clean up oil spills from oil derived from tar and oil sands.  No distinction exists between finished products refined from crude oil or those refined from tar sands.  This provision would reduce the deficit by approximately $2 billion over 10 years.   Replacing Sequestration   The American Family Economic Protection Act would delay from March 1, 2013 to January 2, 2014 the across-the-board cuts, or sequester, that was triggered under the Budget Control Act when the so-called “Supercommittee” failed to produce legislation that reduces the deficit.  This delay recognizes that the Act fully offsets the sequester in fiscal year 2013 and offsets approximately $25 billion in fiscal year 2014.  The Act exempts its budgetary effects from the PAYGO scorecards and makes several technical and conforming changes to the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.
FA Insights is a daily newsletter from Business Insider that delivers the top news and commentary for financial advisors. Buffett's Favorite Valuation Metric Has Surged Over 100% And That Isn't A Good Thing (Pragmatic Capitalism) Warren Buffett's favorite valuation metric, the Wilshire 5,000 Total Market Index relative to gross national product, has breached the 100 percent level. The Wilshire 5000 represents the broadest index for the U.S. stock market. This has only taken place a few times, notes Cullen Roche. "It happened during the stock market bubble of the late 90â€²s, but then occurred again just briefly during the 2006-2007 period when the valuation broke the 100% range in Q3 2006 and stayed above that range for about a year.Â  We all know what followed the 2007 peak in stock prices."Â  Advisors Are Expressing Interest In The Treasury's Floating Rate Notes (The Wall Street Journal) Financial advisors and money market fund mangers are interested in the U.S. Treasury's floating rate notes. These are securities that pay a regular coupon, however that coupon is tied to a moving market rate. These investors are being particular about the specific benchmark indices, maturities, etc. David Glocke of Vanguard said, "This would be something I would have a lot of interest in. ...As long as the price is right and there's sufficient liquidity and it's issued on a regular basis, it would be something I'd want to consider for the funds." Credit Investors Are Betting Against Junk Bonds (Financial Times) As retail investors have jumped into junk bonds, credit investors like GSO and the credit arm of Blackstone have grown increasingly bearish on the asset class. These investors began to cut back on their junk bond holdings in late 2012 and have more recently taken short positions, betting that yields on junk bonds will rise.Â  "During 2012 and the early days of 2013, massive inflows into funds buying these securities led to a narrowing of the spreads between the interest rates on junk bonds and those on Treasury securities.Â  As the spreads came in, many of the big funds looked to get out, fearing that junk bond prices could suffer in any economic scenario. If the economy deteriorates, the rising probability of default could cause spreads to widen. If the economy improves, yields would rise â€“ and prices fall â€“ for all manner of fixed-income securities." Stock Market Sentiment Is Close To All-Out Euphoric Levels (CITI) Citi's Panic-Euphoria model is a contrarian indicator that says when investors are panicking it's probably a good time to buy, and vice-versa. "The Panic/Euphoria Model has spiked to near its highs over the past three years, suggesting frothy levels have ensued," Citi's Tobias Levkovich wrote in a note to clients. "While a variety of other factors are constructive for equity indices, this proprietary gauge is starting to get perilously close to euphoria, cutting above the complacency readings seen in April/May 2012. In the past, when the model reached such levels, the equity markets experienced some modest consolidation." Citi Â  The Secret Trading Strategy From The 1930s That Hedge Funders Don't Want You To Know About (Business Insider)  Legendary trader Richard Wyckoff continues to have a cult following on Wall Street. His 1931 book, The Richard D. Wyckoff Method of Trading and Investing in Stocks â€“ A Course of Instruction in Stock Market Science and Technique, is still heavily referenced by hedge fund managers.Â  Drawing on his book BI's Matthew Boesler explains that one of the crucial takeaways, is that to succeed, you have to understand what the big operators are doing. In particular, focus on how they manipulate a stock up or down so you learn how to react when you see it playing out before you.
In a new report, Deutsche Bank Global Strategist Sanjeev Sanyal presents a bunch of charts that put the scope and scale of the global financial markets into perpective. Here's a breakdown of the $209 trillion worth of global financial securities based on asset class: Deutsche Bank Here's the same data, but expressed as a percentage of world GDP: Deutsche Bank Keep in mind, these are estimates that come from various sources and that there may be some double counting.  "We have made every attempt to iron out inconsistencies where possible but problems with definitions and double-counting remain," writes Sanyal. "Thus, the following numbers should not be treated as gospel truth but as an attempt to grasp the scales of magnitude of the worldâ€™s financial markets."
Apple Only four months after launching a new laptop with a high-resolution "retina" screen, Apple has chopped $200 off the price. Apple's 13-inch "Retina" MacBook Pro will now sell for $1,499 instead of the $1,699 original price. This is a small move, but it's symptomatic of the broader challenges that Apple (AAPL) is facing. The most likely reason for a price-cut so soon after launch is that the product wasn't selling well at the original price. And with the 13-inch MacBook, this would not be a surprise: Reviewers were underwhelmed with the laptop when it was released, arguing that, at $1,699, it was not a good value. Based on the price cut, it appears that Apple laptop buyers agreed. The price cut reveals that consumers won't rush to buy the latest greatest Apple product just because Apple made it. The price-value tradeoff has to be reasonable. And in the case of the MacBook Pro, it apparently wasn't. This problem — the price-value tradeoff — has become an issue for Apple far beyond laptops. As smartphones become a commodity, Apple's most important product line — the iPhone — is experiencing similar challenges. The explosive growth in the smartphone market in recent years has shifted to emerging markets, where price is a major factor in consumer decision-making. By not offering a cheap iPhone that is affordable for consumers in these markets — $100–$200 without a contract or subsidy — Apple has missed out on much of this growth. Meanwhile, the competition at the high end of the smartphone market, where Apple once dominated the field, has become much more intense. And Apple's premium product — the iPhone 5 — is no longer considered by some to be the best product on the market. Unless Apple can firmly re-establish the iPhone's superiority, which does not look likely to happen anytime soon, the company may face increasing pressure to improve the price-value proposition for this product, too. And that might be devastating for Apple's profit margin, which is currently extraordinarily high for a hardware company. The same story is playing out in tablets. The price-value tradeoff of some recent tablet entrants has reduced Apple's dominance of this product category — a category that Apple invented and, a few years ago, had to itself. The price pressure in the tablet market, in which consumers can now get excellent tablets for much less than Apple is charging, will likely force Apple to continue to improve the price-value proposition of its iPads. And this, in turn, will also likely begin to eat into Apple's profit margin. A few years ago, in phones and tablets, Apple was both the price leader and the product leader. Apple's products were better than the competition's, and they were cheaper. Today, that is no longer the case. And it probably means that Apple's extraordinary profit margin will continue to decline.

Soaring housing costs, declining income levels, and a job market yet to regain ground have hit New York City residents hard â€” especially its middle class. To even be considered middle class in the city, residents need to bankrollÂ between $45,000 and $134,000 per year, The New York Times recently reported.Â In other parts of the country, that drops to $33,000 - $100,000.Â  "We need to make sure that the people who want to stay in our great city can afford to stay here," City Council Speaker Christine Quinn said in a recent State of the City address. One of the largest concerns among city leaders is securing more affordable housing (Manhattan apartments cost $3,973 a month on average â€“â€“ Â $2,800 more than the national average). Quinn is spearheading the construction of 40,000 new middle-income housing units over the next decade, a move she hopes will give the cash-strapped class room to breathe.Â  Her office recently released a reportÂ on the state of the city's middle class community. We've pulled out the most compelling charts from the presentation.Â 
GoldMoney Foundation via YouTubeOne of the most striking aspects of the current bull run in the U.S. stock market is the lack of a correction (e.g. 5 percent sell-off) in months. As stocks close in on new all-time highs, even the most bullish stock market bulls are worried about this. Swiss hedge fund manager Felix Zulauf is particularly concerned, and he warns if we don't get some sort of sell-off soon, we could see a crash. He spoke with King World News' Eric King: ...It’s a top building process that we are in.  If the markets do not correct as I expect some time in spring, if the markets would continue to go up, and not be confirmed by internal technicals, then it gets very, very dangerous.  Then we would resemble much more a market situation that has some similarities to 1987 ... I’m just saying we are in dangerous territory, and people should be aware of that and take precautionary steps.” Zulauf also talks about interest rates and gold. Read more at KingWorldNews.com.

The U.S. housing market is one of the few bright spots in the global economy. However, it could be doing better, especially in the market for new homes. "One head-scratcher many of our clients have been struggling to understand is the delay between starts and completions," writes Lisa Marquis Jackson of John Burns Real Estate Consulting. Here's a table that shows just how much completions are lagging starts: John Burns Real Estate Consulting According to Jackson's analysis, one of the main reasons causing this is lack of labor. "An early morning drive past a day labor staging area underscores the point dramatically-the once-bustling construction employment sector is running very lean on labor," writes Jackson. Here's a photo Jackson allowed Business Insider to publish: John Burns Real Estate Consulting Jackson notes that these areas are typically filled by workers from south of the border.Â  Here's some of her commentary: Housing is heavily dependent on Hispanic laborÂ and migration to the US from Mexico has slowed dramatically. This is due in part to a stronger Mexican economy, new US immigration restrictionsÂ and even the shift into higher-paying jobs in less volatile sectors, like energy and transportation. Add to that the fact that building a house is really hard work. John Burns Real Estate Consulting So, what does all of this mean? Jackson doesn't expect workers to come rushing back to this sector anytime soon.Â  As a result, builders are going to have to incur higher labor costs. From John Burns Real Estate Consulting.
Bloomberg TV via YouTubeT2 Partners has filed its 13F for the fourth quarter with the SEC. The fund's 13F includes holdings of funds managed by Zeke Ashton (the Tilson Dividend Fund) and Glenn Tongue (the Tilson Focus Fund and the Deerhaven Fund) The fund's latest moves remind us of Bill Ackman, the founder of $12 billion Pershing Square Capital Management.

YouTubeEver since Elizabeth Warren went from financial regulatory crusader to Senator from Massachusetts, Wall Street's been wondering what she would do with her new power. Then she got appointed to Senate Banking Committee, and that was a serious clue. Now, at the first Banking Committee hearing of the year, she's totally grilling the bureaucrats testifying on Wall Street reform, so you can forget about clues, all you need to do is read. Her first question was pretty simple, and directed at interim SEC Chairwoman, Elisse Waterman. Why, she asked, aren't more bank executives in jail? "There are District Attorneys... squeezing ordinary people all over the United States.... Why aren't bank CEOs in jail?... I'm really concerned that too big to fail has become to big for trial." Her second question could be as much for bank CEOs as it Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo. "Why are big all these big banks trading below book value," Warren asked. "I can only think of two reasons, she added." First she mused that it was possible no one believes that bank books are honest. The second reason she considered is that no one â€” not the banks, and not the regulators â€” believe that banks are manageable. Tarullo added that investors are likely skeptical as well. So that's how things are going to go, people.
The European housing market appears to be characterized by the house price illusion i.e. the belief that when one house sells for a higher price, other homes will also sell at higher prices and individual wealth increases.Â  This is how it's described by the Real-World Economics Review Blog, who charts four-year prices movements for individual countries using Eurostat data. Economic analyst Jesse Colombo has warned of a housing bubble developing Northern and Western European countries like Finland and Sweden. Ultimately, it's a mistake to assume that Europe, or even parts of Europe, have housing markets that move uniformly.Â  Here's the chart from Eurostat (via RWER) that shows how price changes are all over the place: Eurostat
 I like Heinz. Itâ€™s a great consumer staples business: steadily rising sales, earnings and dividends. My concern, however, is the buyout price. I think Buffett is paying far too much for Heinz. Here are the earnings-per-share figures for the last few years: $2.38, $2.63, $2.90, $2.87, $3.08, $3.35. Weâ€™re half-way through this fiscal year (which ends in April) and HNZ is on track to earn $3.54 per share, and the Street expects 3.79 per share for next year.  Thatâ€™s a good trend. Heinz is growing but it really isnâ€™t growing that fast. Over the last nine years, sales have increased from $8.24 billion to $11.65 billion. Thatâ€™s less than 4% per year.  I understand that the market places a premium on stability of earnings but I have a hard time valuing Heinz at more than $60 per share. And thatâ€™s just at fair value. If I were looking to get Heinz at a bargain, I would be more interested in seeing close to $50 per share.  I should point out that Buffett&#8217;s part of the deal is quite good. He&#8217;s putting up $4.4 billion in equity and buying $8 billion of 9% preferred stock. At the elevated price, the equity will yield 2.84%.

Albert Edwards, the widely-followed bearish strategist at Societe Generale, confused and surprised many people when he said European stocks were "unambiguously cheap." However, this quote was clipped from an investment strategy conference that wasn't covered very closely. In a new note to clients, Edwards aims to explain what he meant. "Investing say, in European equities, on a ten year view at current valuations will probably result in good long term returns<U+0096> the single biggest determinant of long term returns being the valuation at the entry point," he writes. "That view has not changed." But this is not to say that he has turned any more bullish on stocks as an asset class. "Now I don<U+0092>t and didn'<U+0092>t claim any great conversion towards being bullish on equities overall and you will notice our recommended equity weighting remains a rock bottom 30%," he continues. "That is because ours is a global index stance and that stance is dominated by what we believe is a continued extreme overvaluation in US equities." Edwards relies heavily on cyclically adjusted price ratios to value stock markets.  This measure considers long-term averages. On this basis, he think that U.S. stocks are way overvalued and that at these levels they will "undoubtedly drag down the entire equity complex." Here's a chart he refers to: Societe Generale Ultimately, he is not a fan of stocks right now and he thinks they can get a lot cheaper. "We expect more “once in a generation” opportunities to buy cheap equities lie ahead," writes Edwards.

Getco, the high frequency trading firm that bought Knight Capital last year, reported earnings for the first time yesterday, and it was total carnage. The company's profits were down 82% from this time last year because the market lacked the high volume and volatility high frequency traders feed off of, according to Bloomberg: Net income fell 82 percent to $24.6 million in the nine months ended Sept. 30, compared with $134.8 million a year ago, according to a filing today. Revenue decreased 41 percent to $425.3 million. Getco agreed to buy Knight in a $1.4 billion deal after the market maker lost more than $450 million when computers generated a flood of erroneous orders in August. Just, ugly.

Buffalo Wild Wings is testing out a whole new pricing system for its wings.Â  Chicken wing prices are at a record high and they're cutting into the chain's profits. The chain currently buys them from suppliers by the pound, then sells them to the consumer in fixed numbers of wings. The new method downplays the actual number of wings in each order. Instead, it presents variable-size portions based on weight. "I think that itâ€™s important for, and this is the harder part to communicate, is that because the wing sizes have gotten so much larger, five wings yields more ounces of chicken than six used to," said CEO Sally SmithÂ on the company's Q4 earnings call with analysts.Â "So the guest I think is seeing a value in additional protein, I guess. It is â€“ it probably does take a little bit getting used to if weâ€™re consistently serving five." The move is essentially a price increase,Â noted Goldman Sachs analyst Michael Kelter on the call. "But itâ€™s probably a more conspicuous price increase than any other you could take because it does change the way the consumer interacts with the concept," said Kelter. The new system is in place in 64 Buffalo Wild Wings locations and it includes both company-owned and franchised restaurants. How is the test going so far? Well, it's still being tweaked. Buffalo Wild Wings is still having trouble figuring out the right portion sizes. Smith explained on the company's Q4 earnings call with analysts â€” helpfully transcribed by Seeking Alpha: "We have been testing different ounces of meat in letâ€™s say the single, double, of wings in the single, double and triple. A franchisee for example was using a targeted amount. We had been using a targeted ounce amount similar to when the wings were smaller. And we just want to get that right. So, no, we havenâ€™t been getting push back. I think a lot of it has to do with how we explain to our guests, whether we say, okay, today weâ€™re serving five wings for a small order or six wings and making sure that, that guest understands. So as they, you know, this has been the way weâ€™ve served wings for 30 years, and making that transition, we just want to make sure we get it right."
Annual demand for gold in 2012 reached a record $236.4 billion, but in terms of tonnage fell 4 percent year-over-year to 4,405.5 tonnes, according to a new report from World Gold Council. Central banks, however, bought 534.6 metric tons of gold last year, the highest level in nearly 50 years. Nevertheless, investor and central bank demand could not offset the drop in consumer demand. It's worth noting that annual gold demand was still 15 percent higher than the average for the previous five years. This chart shows the breakdown of gold demand by tons and gold price: World Gold Council In the fourth quarter gold demand totaled 1,195.9 tonnes, the second highest quarterly figure on record after Q3 2011. In value terms, demand reached $66.2 billion. In the fourth quarter jewelry and central bank gold demand increased, and India accounted for 11 percent of the YoY increase in jewelry demand.
At 10:30 this morning the Senate Banking Committee will convene for the first time since the start of 2013. That means it will be freshman Elizabeth Warren's (D-Mass.) first hearing as a member of the Senate. She's been keeping a low profile in Washington, according to Politico. Most of her efforts so far have been specifically for her home state, so it'll be interesting to see if she is more outspoken today. The topic of today's hearing is “Wall Street Reform: Oversight of Financial Stability and Consumer and Investor Protections,” and here are the speakers: They'll be talking about everything from the implementation of Dodd-Frank and the Volcker Rule to derivatives regulation and consumer protection.
Here's a neat breakdown of domestic and international gold consumer demand trends from the World Gold Council. World Gold Council 
Bloomberg WestElon Musk driving a TeslaWe've reached the next round in the New York Times versus Tesla fight. To recap, reporter John Broder wrote a review critiquing the Model S' battery charge on Sunday. Tesla CEO Elon Musk fired back on Twitter, Bloomberg and CNBC calling the review "fake" because Broder had left out parts of his trip that would have put extra stress on the car. Broder responded on the Times' website, saying Musk had actually called him to apologize for the car's poor performance before slamming him on cable. Now, Musk has posted a detailed blog bulleting the alleged flaws in Broder's review. Tesla installs all sorts of monitors in to track the car's movements when it's given to journalists after a similar allegation about the car's battery capacity was leveled two years ago on the British show "Top Gear."   Musk says the data tell a different story than Broder's.  "While the vast majority of journalists are honest, some believe the facts shouldn’t get in the way of a salacious story," he writes. That's a pretty heavy charge to level against a journalist. So let's break it down... The Model S is supposed to go 265 miles before it needs to be charged. The trip was from suburban Washington DC to Milford, Conn. and the weather was hovering in the '30s. Broder says he left with a full charge, reached a Delaware charging dock with the battery still having "roughly half its energy remaining."  He got lunch, and 49 minutes the display read “charge complete.” The "estimated available driving distance" was now 242 miles. When Broder crossed into New Jersey, things began to go wrong: ...the estimated range was falling faster than miles were accumulating. At 68 miles since recharging, the range had dropped by 85 miles, and a little mental math told me that reaching Milford would be a stretch. When he made it to Manhattan, the car had 79 miles left, and the Milford charging station was 73 miles away.  But "about 20 miles from Milford, less than 10 miles of range remained," he said. He did make it to Milford and was able to recharge. He drove on to Groton and went to bed with 90 miles left. When he woke up, the temperature had plummeted — and so had the mileage remaining.  The display showed 25 miles of remaining range — the electrical equivalent of someone having siphoned off more than two-thirds of the fuel that was in the tank when I parked.  The whole time, Broder tried to follow the car's voluminous rules and advice for max performance, still to no avail. He claims the Model S battery never ran out of energy at any time. Here's his annotated chart that allegedly proves this: Tesla But another chart does show the estimate mileage twice hit zero: Tesla Musk says "the final leg of [Broder's] trip was 61 miles and yet he disconnected the charge cable when the range display stated 32 miles. He did so expressly against the advice of Tesla personnel and in obvious violation of common sense." But Broder actually says this: Instead, I spent nearly an hour at the Milford service plaza as the Tesla sucked electrons from the hitching post. When I continued my drive, the display read 185 miles, well beyond the distance I intended to cover before returning to the station the next morning for a recharge and returning to Manhattan. And upon pulling in to Groton in the evening: When I parked the car, its computer said I had 90 miles of range, twice the 46 miles back to Milford. Musk quotes* Broder that “the car fell short of its projected range on the final leg” and that Broder "bizarrely states that the screen showed 'Est. remaining range: 32 miles.'  "The car actually did an admirable job exceeding its projected range."  Had he not insisted on doing a nonstop 61-mile trip while staring at a screen that estimated half that range, all would have been well. He constructed a no-win scenario for any vehicle, electric or gasoline. On that leg, he drove right past a public charge station while the car repeatedly warned him that it was very low on range. Most of Musk's resposnse hinges on these types of allegations — that Broder did not include essential parts of his trip that drained the car's battery further. This would include, as Musk writes, "an unplanned detour through downtown Manhattan to give his brother a ride, the display said '0 miles remaining.'" And when he to to Milford... Instead of plugging in the car, he drove in circles for over half a mile in a tiny, 100-space parking lot. When the Model S valiantly refused to die, he eventually plugged it in. It's unquestionably true that trying to find parking in Manhattan* could drain both man and machine, but it seems dubious to pin this on a detour that lasted less than two miles. You can read the whole thing here.  For all the detail in Musk's post, it doesn't wipe away how taxing it seems to be to obey the car's demands. Update: Broder emails regarding the Musk charge that "While the vast majority of journalists are honest, some believe the facts shouldn’t get in the way of a salacious story."  We're preparing a detailed response to the factual assertions in Mr. Musk's post, but I don't think we're going to respond to these and other ad hominem attacks.  *Correction: We originally said Musk cited quotes that did not appear in Broder's review. They were actually in a caption accompanying the story. We also incorrectly said Musk alleged Broder was trying to find parking in Manhattan. It was acutally Milford. For the original Elon Musk frustration, see here &gt;

Getty Images / Streeter LeckaThe "Oracle of Omaha" Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and investment firm 3G Capital are buying ketchup maker Heinz for $28 billion. The stock is up over 20 percent in the pre-market.  Everyone is probably wondering how much Secretary of State John Kerry and his wife Teresa Heinz Kerry, the Heinz ketchup heiress, might make from this deal.  All members of the Senate, House, Executive branch and Judicial branch are required to disclose assets belonging to their spouse and/or dependent children, according to Open Secrets. According to Open Secrets, last year then-Senator Kerry disclosed his 2011 assets, which included a valuation of $3,000,003 worth of HJ Heinz Co.    It's unclear what the more recent number is at this time, but for purposes of this report, we're going to use that number and do some simple math. From December 30, 2011 through February 13, 2013 the stock moved up 11.92 %, data from Yahoo! Finance shows.  That would put the valuation of that Heinz stake at about $3,357,603 at yesterday's close. Today the stock is up about 20% on the Buffett news so that would be another increase of ~ $671,520 putting the asset valuation of the Heinz stake at $4,029,123, according to our calculations. Not too bad.  Again, it's unclear what the real asset valuation of his HJ Heinz Co stake is at this time or if he bought or sold shares since 2011. Back in January when it was certain Kerry would be confirmed as Secretary of State, the Boston Globe reported that he and his wife agreed to divest a bunch of his investments in both here in the U.S. and abroad to avoid any possible conflicts of interest in his new role.  However, there was no mention of the Kerrys divesting Heinz in the report.  Here's what he agreed to do with that, according to Boston Globe's Bryan Bender: As for other holdings, such as his wife’s stock in the H.J. Heinz Co., Kerry pledged to "not participate personally and substantially in any particular matter that has a direct and predictable effect on my financial interests or those of any person whose interests are imputed to me, unless I first obtain a written waiver."

So, as the horse-meat lasagna scandal in Europe is spiraling beautifully out of control, weâ€™re now getting hit where it hurts: Makerâ€™s Mark is watering down its bourbon. Unlike the horse-meat folks, Makerâ€™s Mark announced it. They even had an official reason. â€œFact is, demand for our bourbon is exceeding our ability to make it, which means weâ€™re running very low on supply,â€ said the missive that COO Rob Samuels sent to his customers. Theyâ€™d add water to the remaining batchâ€”it would lower alcohol content from 45% to 42%â€”so that thereâ€™d be enough for everybody. The uproar was immediate. The company, a subsidiary of Beam, Inc., though still run by the founding family, had to deal with the clamor. Chairman Emeritus Bill Samuels, Jr. crafted the response. The companyâ€™s focus over the past 50 years has been on â€œproduct quality and consistency.â€ And the primary measure of that consistency was â€œthe unique Makerâ€™s Mark taste profile,â€ he wrote. â€œThatâ€™s all that truly matters in the end.â€ So, why not raise the price to lower demand instead of watering down their bourbon? Well, he wrote, â€œWe donâ€™t want to price Makerâ€™s Mark out of reach.â€ Fighting inflation by watering down bourbon. But there was nothing to worry about. He and Rob personally tested batches of watered-down bourbon, and they all had â€œthe same taste profile that weâ€™ve always had.â€ Their Tasting Panel and â€œstructured consumer researchâ€ agreed: â€œthereâ€™s no difference in the taste.â€ Nobody noticed a difference in the taste either when horse meat replaced beef in frozen lasagna. It was found out through testing. Turns out, there was a vast trading scheme that involved slaughter houses in Romania, traders in Cyprus and the Netherlands, and companies in France, including a subcontractor of the brand Findus, which shipped the meat to tax haven Luxembourg where it was manufactured into frozen dishes that then spread to freezers across Europe. At first it was just lasagna in Britain. Then lasagna in France and elsewhere. Now theyâ€™re finding horse meat in other frozen foods. In France, for example, cannelloni, spaghetti bolognese, moussaka, and hachis parmentier were hastily yanked off the shelves at six supermarket chains. On Wednesday, another French brand, Picard, found horse meat in its frozen lasagna and chili con carne. It suspended the sale of all products containing â€œbeefâ€ that had been supplied by one of the parties in the Findus web. In Britain, an investigation has started. Catherine Brown, chief executive of the Foods Standards Agency, called for retailers to test their dishes containing â€œpork,â€ â€œchicken,â€ and other meats. Retailers were currently focusing on â€œcomminutedâ€ beef, she explained, â€œthe stuff where meat is ground up to the point that it is not readily recognizable.â€ While I have not knowingly eaten horse meat in Europe, I had horse meat in Japan, carnivore that I am. As sashimi, served raw, thinly sliced, with raw onions, fresh ground ginger, in a vinegar-soy sauce. Delicious. But there is a dilemma. In France, horse meat consumption has plummeted from 1.8 kg per capita (4 pounds) in 1979 to a measly 0.34 kg (12 ounces) in 2009. It now makes up only 0.4% of total meat consumptionsâ€”not counting the â€œbeefâ€ in frozen foods. In other European countries, demand for horse meat has collapsed similarly. Prices are low. The meat isnâ€™t toxic. So why not feed it to people who donâ€™t know what theyâ€™re eating? Just grind it up, stuff it in manufactured lasagna or whatever, hide it inside an enticing package, call it â€œbeef,â€ freeze it, and when consumers stick it in the microwave, theyâ€™ll never know. Because they canâ€™t taste the difference. â€œIndustrial terrorism,â€ it was called in France. Findus and every company in the trading web claim to have been victimized, much like consumers. But if theyâ€™d wanted to know what that cheap meat was and where it had come from, they could have found out. Or they could have refused to buy meat of shady origin. But they didnâ€™t want to. What mattered was the cost of the meat. It would keep profit margins high and avoid price increases. As the belts of consumers are being tightened notch by notch, price pressures become enormous. Consumer product companies are reacting in myriad ways [The â€œPauperization ofÂ Europeâ€]. Some are disclosed or obvious, others are hard to detect. But itâ€™s an insidious form of inflation that doesnâ€™t show up on the price tag and isnâ€™t counted in the inflation statistics. But youâ€™re eating lower quality food, and youâ€™re getting less for your money that is constantly being debased, and then, when you finally had it, you end up self-medicating with watered-down bourbon. So I love steaks. Rare. But now we find out about the potentially deadly industry practice of mechanical tenderization. It has been going on for decades, with innumerable victims. Yet the industry resists even the most basic labeling requirement that would save lives. Read.... The Beef Industryâ€™s Deadly Secret: â€œBladingâ€ and â€œNeedlingâ€Â 
APEarlier, today Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway announced it and 3G Capital would acquire HJ Heinz Company in a transaction worth a whopping $28 billion. HJ Heinz, the son of immigrant parents, built this this company from scratch. After falling to bankruptcy, Heinz came back to rebuild a company that would eventually gross over $11 billion in sales per year.
Everyone's talking about the massive deal Warren Buffett did buying Heinz ketchup for $28 billion in cash, $72.50 a share. Thing is, Buffett's not doing this alone. Berkshire Hathaway will own 50% of Heinz, and another company, 3G Investments will own the the rest. 3G, a buy-out firm, is owned by the richest man in Brazil (and the 37th richest man in the world), Jorge Lemann, and in the last few years Lemann has done some big deals with big names. In 2008 Lemann bought a 10% stake in Anheuser-Busch InBev. with his two billionaire partners in 3G, Carlos Alberto Sicupira and Marcel Herrmann Telles. That's when the world really started paying attention to this former Brazilian national tennis star's aggressive management style. He seriously cut costs and employee perks like free beer. In 2010 he did another big deal with an American company. Using 3G Capital, his American investment firm, Lemann, his partners, and fellow Brazilian billionaire Eike Batista, managed a leveraged buy-out of Burger King (you can thank Lemann for getting rid of that creepy Burger King king, he fired the ad firm that came up with it). It was a hugely successful acquisition and in 2 years they sold 29% of the company to hedge fund manager Bill Ackman's UK investment vehicle, Justice Holdings. It was Justice that took Burger King public again last year (from FT): â€œWhen I learnt that Burger King was interested in a possible transaction with Justice, I brought the opportunity to my Justice founding partners to consider,â€ Mr Ackman said. â€œThey liked what I saw, a 58-year-old global brand, and a simple, predictable, free cash flow growth franchise in the process of transformation into a pure brand royalty business.â€ Lemann became the richest man in Brazil when he overtook Eike Batista last year.
Flickr/thephotographymuseThis is another good economic datapoint for the US. Initial jobless claims have fallen to 341K. That's FAR below the expectations of 365K, and last month's upwardly revised 366K. Initial jobless claims are one of the best high-frequency, real-time indicators of the economy. Seeing this fall is a great sign.

AP ImagesFor the first time since January 2007, California did not have the properties with the most foreclosure filings, according to RealtyTrac's latest foreclosure report.  California received a total of 18,093 foreclosure filings, and Florida had the most with 29,800.  Moreover, California had 4,386 foreclosure starts – the pace at which mortgages enter the foreclosure process – in January, down 62 percent from last month, and 75 percent from a year ago, hitting a seven-year low. The decline was largely due to a fall in notices of default (NOD). The huge improvement in the state's foreclosure market has been attributed to the California Homeowner Bill of Rights which became a law on January 1, 2013.  The law was created to guarantee a fair and transparent foreclosure process for homeowners. It prevents mortgage servicers from pushing the foreclosure process forward if the homeowner is trying to secure a loan modification, i.e. restricts 'dual track foreclosure'. It also guarantees a single point of contact for homeowners as they deal with the process. The law also forces lenders will to verify documents before filing them and so on. "As a result, the downward foreclosure trend in California accelerated into hyper speed in January, decisively shifting the balance of power when it comes to the nation’s foreclosure activity," said RealtyTrac's vice-president Daren Blomquist in a press release. He added that the national foreclosure rate (which was down 28 percent year-over-year and 7 percent from last month) was also impacted in large part by this law.  California however continues to have a fairly high foreclosure rate, with one in every 753 homes receiving a foreclosure filing, above the national average.

Chris Sloan/AirchiveThis morning, US Airways and American Airlines have announced an $11 billion merger, that has been expected for a long time. AA has posted a big FAQ, which includes a whole section on loyalty programs, elite status, miles, and everything else. Basically, for now everything remains the same as the companies will be operated separately. Eventually there will be some combination. (via Jake Sherman) ---------------------------- There is no immediate impact to the AAdvantage program. At this time, American and US Airways will remain separate companies and each company will maintain its current loyalty program — our AAdvantage program and US Airways Dividend Miles. AAdvantage miles earned by customers are secure and existing miles will continue to be honored. The AAdvantage program, including the elite program and its various facets such as lifetime status, upgrades, and bonus mileage, are intact. In addition, customers can continue to earn miles through existing AAdvantage participating companies and can redeem those miles for the same great awards — flights, upgrades, car rentals and hotels just to name a few. At this time, American and US Airways will remain separate companies and each company will maintain its current loyalty program, which means we will maintain our AAdvantage program, other customer service programs, and our current relationships with oneworld and other airline partners. American remains committed to providing a superior customer experience with a focus on delivering what our customers value most — the newest fleet with our upcoming aircraft deliveries, network strength in the important cities of the world and world-class products, service and technology. Once the merger is complete, the new American will evaluate how best to structure its loyalty program. Ultimately, the combined company is expected to offer members more opportunities to earn and burn miles from an expanded global network of routes and partnerships, unmatched redemption options including flights, hotels, car rentals, vacation packages, one-way awards and lounge memberships, and much more. At this time, American and US Airways will remain separate companies and each company will maintain its current loyalty program — our AAdvantage program and US Airways Dividend Miles. We expect the transaction to close in the third quarter of 2013, subject to customary approvals and closing conditions, and will keep you updated throughout the process. Not at this time.

David McNew/Getty ImagesThe California Homeowner Bill of Rights that became a law at the start of the year has helped bring down the national foreclosure rate, according to RealtyTrac's latest foreclosure report. Foreclosure filings on U.S. properties were down 7 percent month-over-month, and 28 percent on the year.Â  "The U.S. foreclosure landscape in January was profoundly altered by the effects of new legislation that took effect in California on the first of the year,â€ said Daren Blomquist, vice president at RealtyTrac in a press release.Â  â€œDubbed the Homeowners Bill of Rights, this legislation extends many of the principles in the national mortgage settlement â€” including a prohibition on so-called dual tracking and requiring a single point of contact for borrowers facing foreclosure â€” to all mortgage servicers operating in California. ...As a result, the downward foreclosure trend in California accelerated into hyper speed in January, decisively shifting the balance of power when it comes to the nationâ€™s foreclosure activity."

AP ImagesThe U.S. and Canada are still awaiting a decision on the construction of Transcanada's Keystone XL pipeline, which would deliver cheap Canadian crude oil to the midwest and the Gulf Of Mexico ports. The latest word from Sec. of State John Kerry is that a decision will come the "near term." The pipeline comes with the promise of more jobs and higher tax revenues. However, it's unclear if it'll bring oil prices down and increase American energy independence. However, it also comes with serious environmental risks that have high powered financiers like GMO's Jeremy Grantham worried. This pipeline has the country divided. We want to bring you up to speed on the state of the debate.
Chris Sloan/Airchive(Reuters) - American Airlines and US Airways Groupsaid they plan to merge in a deal that will form the world's biggest air carrier, which will have a combined equity value of $11 billion. The merger caps a wave of consolidation that has helped put U.S. airlines on more solid financial footing. The widely expected deal has been more than a year in the making. American, a unit of AMR Corp, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November 2011, and US Airways began its pursuit of a merger in early 2012.

Olympic and Paralympic sprinter Oscar Pistorius has been accused of shooting and killing his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, at his home in South Africa. There has been a suggestion that the shooting was accidental, that Pistorius mistook Steenkamp for a burglar in what might have been a Valentine's Day surprise gone awry. But South African police have reportedly said that the theory that the shooting was accidental did not come from them. And police will reportedly oppose bail for Pistorius. According to the AP, Pistorius was undergoing blood alcohol and forensic tests and requested a quick appearance in court. A police spokesperson said there have been "previous incidents" at Pistorius's home. More details here &gt;
The story of the day is ugly Q4 Eurozone GDP numbers. Okay, maybe that's not surprising to you. Ugly Eurozone GDP numbers, what's new? Fair enough, but this chart posted by economist Philippe Waechter of Natixis really puts it into context. Basically, after the financial crisis, the Eurozone (just like the US) massively fell off the previous trend rate of growth. Output has been far below potential. But now, unlike in the US, the Eurozone is even falling off its post-crisis trend. Granted, Q4 might have been the bottom, and economies are expected to rebound a bit in 2013, but this is very bad. The economies in Europe are falling off an already subpar trend. Philippe Waechter, Twitter
As markets decline in Europe, in part thanks to ugly GDP reports, the Euro is getting clobbered. Perhaps the ECB will have more room to ease. FinViz
The theme of today is bad GDP reports. Greece meanwhile continues to be mired in horrible numbers. From the Hellenic Statistical Authority: Available non-seasonally-adjusted data indicate that, in the 4th quarter of 2012, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at constant prices of year 2005 decreased by 6.0% in comparison with the 4th quarter of 2011. Here's a chart that tells it all. Greek GDP
Another GDP miss, which is a theme around the world today. Eurozone Q4 GDP has fallen by 0.6%. Expectations were for a decline of 0.4%. From the report: GDP fell by 0.6% in the euro area (EA17) and by 0.5% in the EU271 during the fourth quarter of 2012, compared with the previous quarter, according to flash estimates published by Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union. In the third quarter of 2012, growth rates were -0.1% and +0.1% respectively. Compared with the same quarter of the previous year, seasonally adjusted GDP fell by 0.9% in the euro area and by 0.6% in the EU27 in the fourth quarter of 2012, after -0.6% and -0.4% respectively in the previous quarter. During the fourth quarter of 2012, GDP in the United States was stable compared with the previous quarter (after +0.8% in the third quarter of 2012). Compared with the same quarter of the previous year, GDP rose by 1.5% in the United States (after +2.6% in the previous quarter). Over the whole year 20123, GDP fell by 0.5% in the euro area and by 0.3% in the EU27. Eurostat
(Reuters) - U.S. hedge fund investor George Soros has gained about $1 billion since November betting against the yen, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people with knowledge of the firm's position. The yen lost nearly 20 percent against the dollar between November and early February, picking up speed as Japan's new government put pressure on the Bank of Japan to ease monetary policy more aggressively to defeat deflation. Soros Fund Management's internal portfolio, which has been led by Scott Bessent since last summer, holds about 10 percent Japanese shares, the paper reported, citing people close to the firm. Investors including David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital, Daniel Loeb's Third Point LLC and Kyle Bass's Hayman Capital Management LP, also made big trading profits by riding the yen down, the Journal said. The Journal did not say how much profit Greenlight, Third Point, and Hayman Capital made on yen trade. "We put the trades on about three years ago and the trade wasn't fun for the first two years and number of months," Einhorn told the Journal, adding that he expects further weakness. Investors have wagered against the yen in various ways, from complicated derivatives to simple put options, the kind that Einhorn bought, the Journal said. Soros Fund, Third Point, Hayman Capital and Greenlight Capital could not be immediately reached for comment by Reuters outside regular U.S. business hours.

The one big economic report that's coming out today: Initial jobless claims. Consensus is for a reading of 365K, which is basically flat from last month. Generally this number has been steadily trending down, although it's been very noisy for the past several weeks thanks to holidays and post-Sandy weirdness. We'll start to see if any of the new economic headwinds (payroll tax, gas prices, sequester, etc.) start to show up. The number comes out at 8:30 AM ET. FRED
Athit Perawongmetha / Getty ImagesThe story of the day is: Weak GDP numbers everywhere. It started in Japan, where GDP came in at -0.1%, vs expectations of 0.1% growth. Meanwhile, GDP numbers across Europe are lower as well. Specifically, Germany saw economic contraction of 0.6%, while France saw contraction of 0.3% in Q4, according to MarketWatch. Italian GDP fell by 0.9%, also worse than expected. Eurozone GDP fell 0.6% vs. expectations of a 0.4% decline. Numbers out of Greece and Portugal are also awful. European markets started the day higher, but are all falling. Spain is down nearly 1%. Italy is off 0.8%. Germany is down 0.3%.
