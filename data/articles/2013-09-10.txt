APFormer New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer has called Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer to concede in the Democratic primary for New York City comptroller. With 95% of precincts reporting as of 11:40 p.m., The Associated Press projected Stringer as the winner with 51.92% of the vote. He led Spitzer by more than 20,000 votes. The stunning loss for Spitzer ended an attempted comeback bid, five years after he resigned as governor amid a prostitution scandal. Even in mid-August, Spitzer appeared to be in complete command of this race â€” and many assumed he would win, if only because of his heavy name-recognition advantage over Stringer. A Quinnipiac University survey in August put Spitzer up nearly 20 points.Â  But he soon saw that lead crumble over the next few weeks. In Quinnipiac's last survey before the election, Stringer held a 7-point lead over Spitzer.
AP PhotoBlythe Masters, the chief of JP Morgan's commodities unit, could leave the bank in a deal to exit JPM from the physical commodities business, a person close to her toldÂ the Wall Street Journal. Masters, an economist, is widely credited with creating the credit default swap, and was the youngest woman to become a managing director at the bank at age 28. JP Morgan only got into the physical commodities business by chance, during the financial crisis. That's when it inherited Bear Stearns' commodities units and then bought RBS' for a song. The problem is that according to bank regulation dating bank to the 1960s, bank-holding companies like JPM are not supposed to hold these assets anyway. Now the Fed gets to decide whether JPM, and all the other major banks, will keep these businesses. JPM has already said it's willing to let it all go. What the WSJ is saying is that Masters could leave JPM for whoever buys the business as part of the deal. Masters' unit has come under fire recently too. This summer JP Morgan paid a $410 million fine to settle charges that its traders were manipulating energy markets. Regulators are still investigating the unit too. That's a lot of eyes on it.
White HousePresident Barack Obama said Tuesday night that he has asked Congress to postpone votes on authorizing military strikes in Syria while working on a potential diplomatic solution that has popped up in the past two days. "Sometimes resolutions and statements of condemnation are simply not enough," Obama said, adding that the world knows that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was responsible for a chemical weapons attack against his own people on Aug. 21. His speech came amid rapidly evolving circumstancesÂ that have completely shifted the expected tone of his speech. When he announced it last week, it looked like he would be attempting to persuade Congress and the public to support his plan of military action. That is no longer the immediate case. This speech consisted of Obama explaining to Americans why it is in U.S. national security interests for Syria to face consequences for chemical weapons use. He stressed that any military action would be limited, but also effective.Â  "The United States doesn't do pinpricks," Obama said. And though he said that he has a "deeply held preference for diplomatic solutions," he expressed cautious optimism about the new Russia-Syria plan to turn over Syrian chemical weapons to international control. "I believe America should act...that is what makes America different. That is what makes us exceptional," Obama said. Here's the full text of Obama's speech: My fellow Americans, tonight I want to talk to you about Syria -- why it matters, and where we go from here.Â  Over the past two years, what began as a series of peaceful protests against the repressive regime of Bashar al-Assad has turned into a brutal civil war.Â  Over 100,000 people have been killed.Â  Millions have fled the country.Â  In that time, America has worked with allies to provide humanitarian support, to help the moderate opposition, and to shape a political settlement.Â  But I have resisted calls for military action, because we cannot resolve someone elseâ€™s civil war through force, particularly after a decade of war in Iraq and Afghanistan. The situation profoundly changed, though, on August 21st, when Assadâ€™s government gassed to death over a thousand people, including hundreds of children.Â  The images from this massacre are sickening:Â  Men, women, children lying in rows, killed by poison gas.Â  Others foaming at the mouth, gasping for breath.Â  A father clutching his dead children, imploring them to get up and walk.Â  On that terrible night, the world saw in gruesome detail the terrible nature of chemical weapons, and why the overwhelming majority of humanity has declared them off-limits -- a crime against humanity, and a violation of the laws of war.Â  This was not always the case.Â  In World War I, American GIs were among the many thousands killed by deadly gas in the trenches of Europe.Â  In World War II, the Nazis used gas to inflict the horror of the Holocaust.Â  Because these weapons can kill on a mass scale, with no distinction between soldier and infant, the civilized world has spent a century working to ban them.Â  And in 1997, the United States Senate overwhelmingly approved an international agreement prohibiting the use of chemical weapons, now joined by 189 governments that represent 98 percent of humanity. On August 21st, these basic rules were violated, along with our sense of common humanity.Â  No one disputes that chemical weapons were used in Syria.Â  The world saw thousands of videos, cell phone pictures, and social media accounts from the attack, and humanitarian organizations told stories of hospitals packed with people who had symptoms of poison gas. Moreover, we know the Assad regime was responsible.Â  In the days leading up to August 21st, we know that Assadâ€™s chemical weapons personnel prepared for an attack near an area where they mix sarin gas.Â  They distributed gasmasks to their troops.Â  Then they fired rockets from a regime-controlled area into 11 neighborhoods that the regime has been trying to wipe clear of opposition forces.Â  Shortly after those rockets landed, the gas spread, and hospitals filled with the dying and the wounded.Â  We know senior figures in Assadâ€™s military machine reviewed the results of the attack, and the regime increased their shelling of the same neighborhoods in the days that followed.Â  Weâ€™ve also studied samples of blood and hair from people at the site that tested positive for sarin.Â  When dictators commit atrocities, they depend upon the world to look the other way until those horrifying pictures fade from memory.Â  But these things happened.Â  The facts cannot be denied. The question now is what the United States of America, and the international community, is prepared to do about it.Â  Because what happened to those people -- to those children -- is not only a violation of international law, itâ€™s also a danger to our security. Let me explain why.Â  If we fail to act, the Assad regime will see no reason to stop using chemical weapons.Â  As the ban against these weapons erodes, other tyrants will have no reason to think twice about acquiring poison gas, and using them.Â  Over time, our troops would again face the prospect of chemical warfare on the battlefield.Â  And it could be easier for terrorist organizations to obtain these weapons, and to use them to attack civilians.Â  If fighting spills beyond Syriaâ€™s borders, these weapons could threaten allies like Turkey, Jordan, and Israel.Â  And a failure to stand against the use of chemical weapons would weaken prohibitions against other weapons of mass destruction, and embolden Assadâ€™s ally, Iran -- which must decide whether to ignore international law by building a nuclear weapon, or to take a more peaceful path. This is not a world we should accept.Â  This is whatâ€™s at stake.Â  And that is why, after careful deliberation, I determined that it is in the national security interests of the United States to respond to the Assad regimeâ€™s use of chemical weapons through a targeted military strike.Â  The purpose of this strike would be to deter Assad from using chemical weapons, to degrade his regimeâ€™s ability to use them, and to make clear to the world that we will not tolerate their use.Â Â  That's my judgment as Commander-in-Chief.Â  But Iâ€™m also the President of the worldâ€™s oldest constitutional democracy.Â  So even though I possess the authority to order military strikes, I believed it was right, in the absence of a direct or imminent threat to our security, to take this debate to Congress.Â  I believe our democracy is stronger when the President acts with the support of Congress.Â  And I believe that America acts more effectively abroad when we stand together.Â Â  This is especially true after a decade that put more and more war-making power in the hands of the President, and more and more burdens on the shoulders of our troops, while sidelining the peopleâ€™s representatives from the critical decisions about when we use force. Now, I know that after the terrible toll of Iraq and Afghanistan, the idea of any military action, no matter how limited, is not going to be popular.Â  After all, I've spent four and a half years working to end wars, not to start them.Â  Our troops are out of Iraq.Â  Our troops are coming home from Afghanistan.Â  And I know Americans want all of us in WashingtonÂ -- especially me -- to concentrate on the task of building our nation here at home:Â  putting people back to work, educating our kids, growing our middle class. Itâ€™s no wonder, then, that you're asking hard questions.Â  So let me answer some of the most important questions that I've heard from members of Congress, and that I've read in letters that you've sent to me.Â  First, many of you have asked, wonâ€™t this put us on a slippery slope to another war? Â One man wrote to me that we are â€œstill recovering from our involvement in Iraq.â€Â  A veteran put it more bluntly:Â  â€œThis nation is sick and tired of war.â€ My answer is simple:Â  I will not put American boots on the ground in Syria.Â  I will not pursue an open-ended action like Iraq or Afghanistan.Â  I will not pursue a prolonged air campaign like Libya or Kosovo.Â  This would be a targeted strike to achieve a clear objective:Â  deterring the use of chemical weapons, and degrading Assadâ€™s capabilities. Others have asked whether it's worth acting if we donâ€™t take out Assad.Â  As some members of Congress have said, thereâ€™s no point in simply doing a â€œpinprickâ€ strike in Syria. Let me make something clear:Â  The United States military doesnâ€™t do pinpricks.Â  Even a limited strike will send a message to Assad that no other nation can deliver.Â  I don't think we should remove another dictator with force -- we learned from Iraq that doing so makes us responsible for all that comes next.Â  But a targeted strike can make Assad, or any other dictator, think twice before using chemical weapons. Other questions involve the dangers of retaliation.Â  We donâ€™t dismiss any threats, but the Assad regime does not have the ability to seriously threaten our military.Â  Any other retaliation they might seek is in line with threats that we face every day.Â  Neither Assad nor his allies have any interest in escalation that would lead to his demise.Â  And our ally, Israel, can defend itself with overwhelming force, as well as the unshakeable support of the United States of America. Many of you have asked a broader question:Â  Why should we get involved at all in a place that's so complicated, and whereÂ  -- as one person wrote to me -- â€œthose who come after Assad may be enemies of human rights?â€ Itâ€™s true that some of Assadâ€™s opponents are extremists.Â  But al Qaeda will only draw strength in a more chaotic Syria if people there see the world doing nothing to prevent innocent civilians from being gassed to death.Â  The majority of the Syrian people -- and the Syrian opposition we work with -- just want to live in peace, with dignity and freedom.Â  And the day after any military action, we would redouble our efforts to achieve a political solution that strengthens those who reject the forces of tyranny and extremism. Finally, many of you have asked:Â  Why not leave this to other countries, or seek solutions short of force?Â  As several people wrote to me, â€œWe should not be the worldâ€™s policeman.â€Â  I agree, and I have a deeply held preference for peaceful solutions.Â  Over the last two years, my administration has tried diplomacy and sanctions, warning and negotiations -- but chemical weapons were still used by the Assad regime. However, over the last few days, weâ€™ve seen some encouraging signs.Â  In part because of the credible threat of U.S. military action, as well as constructive talks that I had with President Putin, the Russian government has indicated a willingness to join with the international community in pushing Assad to give up his chemical weapons.Â  The Assad regime has now admitted that it has these weapons, and even said theyâ€™d join the Chemical Weapons Convention, which prohibits their use.Â  Itâ€™s too early to tell whether this offer will succeed, and any agreement must verify that the Assad regime keeps its commitments.Â  But this initiative has the potential to remove the threat of chemical weapons without the use of force, particularly because Russia is one of Assadâ€™s strongest allies. I have, therefore, asked the leaders of Congress to postpone a vote to authorize the use of force while we pursue this diplomatic path.Â  Iâ€™m sending Secretary of State John Kerry to meet his Russian counterpart on Thursday, and I will continue my own discussions with President Putin.Â  Iâ€™ve spoken to the leaders of two of our closest allies, France and the United Kingdom, and we will work together in consultation with Russia and China to put forward a resolution at the U.N. Security Council requiring Assad to give up his chemical weapons, and to ultimately destroy them under international control.Â  Weâ€™ll also give U.N. inspectors the opportunity to report their findings about what happened on August 21st.Â  And we will continue to rally support from allies from Europe to the Americas -- from Asia to the Middle East -- who agree on the need for action.Â  Meanwhile, Iâ€™ve ordered our military to maintain their current posture to keep the pressure on Assad, and to be in a position to respond if diplomacy fails.Â  And tonight, I give thanks again to our military and their families for their incredible strength and sacrifices.Â  My fellow Americans, for nearly seven decades, the United States has been the anchor of global security.Â  This has meant doing more than forging international agreements -- it has meant enforcing them.Â  The burdens of leadership are often heavy, but the world is a better place because we have borne them.Â  And so, to my friends on the right, I ask you to reconcile your commitment to Americaâ€™s military might with a failure to act when a cause is so plainly just.Â  To my friends on the left, I ask you to reconcile your belief in freedom and dignity for all people with those images of children writhing in pain, and going still on a cold hospital floor.Â  For sometimes resolutions and statements of condemnation are simply not enough. Indeed, Iâ€™d ask every member of Congress, and those of you watching at home tonight, to view those videos of the attack, and then ask:Â  What kind of world will we live in if the United States of America sees a dictator brazenly violate international law with poison gas, and we choose to look the other way? Franklin Roosevelt once said, â€œOur national determination to keep free of foreign wars and foreign entanglements cannot prevent us from feeling deep concern when ideals and principles that we have cherished are challenged.â€Â  Our ideals and principles, as well as our national security, are at stake in Syria, along with our leadership of a world where we seek to ensure that the worst weapons will never be used. America is not the worldâ€™s policeman.Â  Terrible things happen across the globe, and it is beyond our means to right every wrong.Â  But when, with modest effort and risk, we can stop children from being gassed to death, and thereby make our own children safer over the long run, I believe we should act.Â  Thatâ€™s what makes America different.Â  Thatâ€™s what makes us exceptional.Â  With humility, but with resolve, let us never lose sight of that essential truth.Â  Thank you.Â  God bless you.Â  And God bless the United States of America.

There are more "ultra-rich" people in the world than ever before, with the number of individuals worth $30 million or more approaching 200,000 globally, according to a new report from Wealth-X and UBS. The number of Ultra-High Net Worth (UHNW) individuals (defined in the report as those with total net assets of $30 million and above) is growing particularly quickly in the U.S., which added 5,000 UHNW individuals to its ranks in the past 12 months, for a total of 65,505 ultra-rich. The report also breaks down the number of UHNW individuals by state. Massachusetts had the fastest growth in its ultra-rich population, which increased 35% between 2012 and 2013. Since the biggest states obviously had the largest numbers of wealthy folks, we normalized the data to see which states had the highest proportions of ultra-rich residents. Wyoming, with its small overall population, had the highest number of ultra-rich people per capita of any state. But Washington DC, with its relatively small population and a high concentration of wealth, has the densest ultra-rich population in the U.S. New York, California, Montana, and Connecticut are also all high up there on places you're most likely to meet a very rich person.

China's City Urban Administrative and Law Enforcement Bureau, more commonly known as Chengguan, are notorious for trampling on the rights of civilians. The Chengguan are a "para-police agency" employed by local governments to enforce "non-criminal urban administrative regulations," according to the Human Rights Watch. But on September 4 they decided to take on the People's Liberation Army while attempting to demolish a gatehouse at a military compound, reports China Smack.   In videos posted on Youku and Youtube you can see the Chengguan (dressed in riot gear, and in blue shirts and black pants) attacking members of the PLA.

Reuters/Desmond BoylanFA Insights is a daily newsletter from Business Insider that delivers the top news and commentary for financial advisors. "Red Flag" Advice That Should Send You Running (Wisebread)  Emily Guy Birken of WiseBread is the daughter of a financial planner. Over the years she learned some important lessons from listening to her father and she says investors should watch out for four key red flags when they speak with advisors.Â  1. "You can assume an X% return on your investmentâ€¦ The advisor you want to work with will give you several projections for your investment, based on different potential rates of return." 2. "Don't worry about the cost of this product! You pay nothing." 3. "I can customize a stock portfolio for you. First, it is based upon the assumption that picking stocks is something your average financial planner is capable of doing. â€¦he other major issue with this advice is the customization aspect of it." 4. "There is no risk!" or "You really need to act now." How To Insulate Your Portfolios From Interest Rate Risk (LPL Financial) In a rising interest rate environment investors are naturally worried about the risk to their portfolio. The yield on the 10-year surged from 1.6% on May 2 to 3% last week, and the pace of rise in the interest rates can affect other asset classes too.Â  "There is no way to completely insulate a portfolio from rising rates using traditional investments. Even holding only cash will eventually lose ground to inflation as rates rise (and current money market yields are well below the pace of inflation)," writes Jeff Kleintop of LPL Financial. While it doesn't make sense to completely get rid of all bond exposure he recommends 1. Stocks over bonds. 2. High-yield bonds 3. Low-yield stocks. The Commodities Supercycle Is Over, But The Asset Class Isn't Dead (The AllianceBernstein Blog) While many on the Street argue that the commodities supercycle is over, Jon Ruff and Seth Masters at Alliance Bernstein argue that there are still some good commodity-related investments out there. Iron ore for instance is still an attractive investment because "direct exposure to iron ore prices is taken through futures contracts." Crude Oil represents an opportunity too. "So with spot Brent crude oil prices currently averaging about $110/bbl, we expect prices to fall toward the $95/bbl marginal cost over the next couple of years. This $95/bbl level also happens to be the 2016 futures price for Brent crude. And we think this creates an interesting opportunity to benefit from potential price shocks with relatively little downside." What's more commodities perform well when inflation spikes, which is a time when "stocks and bonds face headwinds." Advisors Want To Expand Their Websites To Include Sections On Living Well (The Wall Street Journal) Some advisors, like Michael Fischer of Arizona-based Sequoia Financial Advisors think it is important for an advisor's website to offer clients information on more than just financial health. Fischer for instance plans to have a dining section with a list of local restaurants that are reviewed by him and his wife. He is also trying to work with a travel agent to include travel destinations. The idea is that it would bring clients back to their site. Some Tech Experts Think Advisors Should Upgrade To The New iPhone (Investment News) Apple just unveiled the iPhone 5 and Investment News polled some technology experts who think advisors should upgrade to the new phone. JP Nicols, CEO of Clientific said its speed, better battery life, and "fingerprint sensor to protect advisors' sensitive data" are good reasons to upgrade. "I also expect that feature to improve payment technologies with better user identification and authentication. The faster processing and better camera could also facilitate more spontaneous video chats with clients."
REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz"Bond god" Jeff Gundlach just concluded a very interesting webcast. His presentation â€” titled "What If?" â€” examined the big stories in the global markets and economy. He spent more time than usual talking about the problems in the emerging markets. And he singled out India as the country most vulnerable to a crisis due to heavy reliance on foreign capital. He thinks the best way to trade India would be to short it while go long China or Russia, which are both insulated from the external capital markets. Gundlach continues to believe interest rates will be low, and he doesn't see inflation/stagflation happening any time soon until commodity prices start to rise more. On Federal debts and deficits, Gundlach thinks that one way to address these issues is to raise the marginal tax rate. As usual, Gundlach supported all of his views with a brief presentation featuring his hand-picked charts. Anyone who wants to understand how the "bond god thinks" should spend a few minutes on this.
(Reuters) - Electronics retailer Best Buy Co Inc on Tuesday said Hubert Joly, its president and chief executive, exercised and sold 350,467 stock options and sold 100,686 shares on September 6 to help cover costs for his recent divorce. "This sale reflects only one thing - Mr. Joly has recently gone through a divorce and needs to sell a portion of his holdings in order to cover the costs of that unfortunate event," spokesman Jeff Shelman said in a statement. "He remains heavily invested in Best Buy." Joly's holdings remain "substantially in excess" of his 140,000 share ownership target under Best Buy's executive stock ownership guidelines following the reported transaction, the company said in a regulatory filing.

More than 200 econ professors and counting have signed an open letter calling on President Obama to name Fed Board Vice Chair Janet Yellen to succeed Ben Bernanke as Fed Chair. And there are some big names among them: Princeton's Alan Blinder, Berkeley's Christina Romer, Columbia's Joseph Stiglitz and Michael Woodford, Yale's Robert Shiller, and San Diego's James Hamilton (who brought the letter to our attention). The pitch highlights Yellen's prescient views in the run-up to the Great Recession, her record on labor issues and openness to a range of views.Â  It's apparently being sponsored by, or at least living on the site of, the Institute for Women's Policy Research. Here's the full text: Dear President Obama: We the undersigned economists, with both academic and practitioner interests in public policy, respectfully urge you to appoint Janet Yellen as the next Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. While there are many reasons to select Janet Yellen for this position, we would like to emphasize three of them. Dr. Yellen is superbly qualified.Â  She has shown consistently good judgment in all her roles leading our nationâ€™s financial institutions and economic policy, first as a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB), then as Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Clinton, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, and now as Vice Chair of the FRB.Â  While leading the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank in 2005, she warned of an impending real estate meltdown as asset prices rose unrealistically. Dr. Yellen was one of the first members of the Federal Open Market Committee to realize that the financial sectorâ€™s difficulties in 2007 could cause a major recession, and she worked to focus her colleagues on the problems of the housing sector.Â  Her knowledge of how the Fed sets policy, her understanding of the relationship between monetary policy and economic growth, and her ability to see and propose solutions to emerging economic problems is second to none. Dr. Yellen is willing to hear multiple points of view and to bring many voices into the policy making arena. Â She is not beholden to a single interest group, nor to a single industry. There is less and less room in modern public policymaking, especially at the FRB, for a single leader to dominate discussion. Â Modern policymaking, in a world filled with uncertainties and complexities, must proceed through cooperation and consensus, led by effective leaders.Â  Dr. Yellen has demonstrated the ability to hear all points of view and then act effectively at the FRB. In her public speeches and scholarly writings, Dr. Yellen demonstrates a clear and nuanced understanding of labor markets, including why they do not always generate enough jobs. As our weak recovery enters into its fifth year of slow economic growth, a continued commitment to expanding jobs through appropriate policy is a must for the next FRB Chair. Dr. Yellen has demonstrated this commitment and understanding in her recent public speeches and actions at the FRB. In conclusion, we believe that Janet Yellen is an extremely effective leader who has demonstrated her capacity to work with the other FRB governors and to bring important perspectives of the American people to her leadership and decisions.Â  In our opinion, she is the best possible leader for the Federal Reserve Board at this critical time in our nationâ€™s history.

APThe Russia-U.S. relationship is the focus of a lot of attention this week, with President Vladimir Putin widely perceived to have out-maneuvered President Barack Obama and winning respect from unlikely corners. Syria, however, is not the only issue between Russia and the U.S. at the moment. Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara announced Tuesday that authorities are seeking to seize luxury apartments and other property said to be used to launder funds by Russian criminal networks. According to a 63-page lawsuit, Cyprus-based companyÂ Prevezon Holdings Ltd. and its New York affiliates must hand over more than $230 million for trying to launder tax fraud money with the purchase of real estate in the U.S. â€” notably the Alexander Condominium building at 250 East 49th street. The case relates specifically to the notorious case of Sergei Magnitsky, the Moscow-based lawyer who was imprisoned and died mysteriously in jail after calling attention to an alleged Russian tax fraud scheme.Â  Magnitsky had been working for Hermitage Capital, a fund managed by American Bill Browder. After Hermitage's Moscow offices were raided in 2007, Magnitsky began investigating and later testified that he had uncovered a huge scam by top police officials to embezzle $230 million in taxes from money that Hermitage Fund companies had paid in 2006. Magnitsky alleged that the corrupt cops had used corporate seals and documents seized in the raid on Hermitage's Moscow office and set up fake companies under the same names, which then received a full tax rebate. The story quickly turned tragic. In November 2008, Magnitsky himself was charged with tax evasion and taken to prison, before he unexpectedly died in November 2009. His death was originally attributed to a an abdominal membrane ruptureÂ before officials changed that to a heart attack. Magnitsky is one of four witnesses in the tax fraud who have died in mysterious circumstances. While an official investigation into his death in 2009 yielded little results, last year a new report, supported by Russia's Presidential human rights council, found that police torture appeared to have contributed to Magnitsky's death. Russian officials have never admitted any wrongdoing. Magnitsky himself was later found guilty of tax fraud. Magnitsky's death and the events surrounding it significantly soured relations between the U.S. and Russia, effectively derailing Obama's ballyhooed "reset." Hermitage founder Browder lobbied tirelessly for harsher sanctions on the alleged perpetrators, and last year he succeeded in getting a law passed thatÂ effectively blacklisted officialsÂ involved in the caseÂ from the U.S. and from holding American assets â€” what has become known as the "Magnitsky Act." Of course, Russia didn't take this lying down. In response to the 18 names on the U.S. list, Russia released its own listÂ of US officials barred from Russia for alleged human rights abuses. The Russian Duma also responded by banning the adoption of Russian orphans by American families. Now U.S. authorities believe that Prevezon Holdings is part of the network of companies set up by suspects in the Magnitsky case. The action seems likely to be controversial, but U.S. authorities seem steadfast â€” despite what may be bad timing. â€œAs alleged, a Russian criminal enterprise sought to launder some of its billions in ill-gotten rubles through the purchase of pricey Manhattan real estate," Bharara said in a statement obtained by Reuters. "While New York is a world financial capital, it is not a safe haven for criminals seeking to hide their loot, no matter how and where their fraud took place."
REUTERS/Brendan McDermidJeffrey GundlachJeff Gundlach of DoubleLine Funds just wrapped up his latest public webcast. He reiterated his calls for interest rates and inflation to remain low. He also reiterated his worry about the longer risks of high Federal debts and deficits. Gundlach spent quite a bit of time on the turmoil in the emerging markets, particularly India. "I would not own the Indian stock market," he said. "It looks very scary." Gundlach attributed India's woes to its collapsing foreign currency reserves and it's heavy reliance on external financing. He pointed to the tight inverse correlation betweent the rupee and U.S. interest rates as evidence of this. But he doesn't hate all of the emerging markets. Despite their local problems, both China and Russia are insulated thanks to low reliance on foreign capital. "I think Russia and China are interesting to own," he said. How would he trade this? "Long China, short India. Long Russia, short India." "The Federal Reserve, I think is making a big mistake." Fed governors have been eerily quiet; we haven't heard from a pure governor since July. An emerging market crisis is a candidate for something that could cause rates to fall.  Risk of inflation diminshes as well. There's a very tight correlation between U.S. interest rates and the Indian rupee.&nbsp; Foreign currency reserves have collapsed. "I would not own the Indian stock market. It looks very scary." He doesn't hate all EMs. Just doesn't like India. China doesn't need foreign capital. They have internal financing. Insulated. "Long China short other emerging markets is a winning trade." Russia is also insulated because it doesn't need foreign capital. "I think Russia and China are interesting to own." Watch out for this one. Not a very strong sign for inflation.  The best candidate for a problem in the emerging markets. Net interest on debt will become a problem. This is why the Fed needs to keep rates so low. Social Security deficit is tame now, but explodes in just a few years. Spanish home prices still down significantly. Spanish debt delinquencies extremely high. S&amp;P Homebuildiners ETF is still very high, back to 2007 levels. Thought that was a bubble. Mortgage applications index 1) is falling and 2) never really rebounded. "Housing is not the economic tailwind it used to be." There won't be a regime change. Odds are better Anthony Weiner wins primary. "I kind of like gold." Likes pair trades.

statigr.am/lovelee12_A surprising thing happens to people in their forties. After working hard, buying a house, and starting a family, they suddenly realize that they’d better start being responsible with their money. They begin reading financial books and trying to learn how to set up a nest egg for themselves and their families. It’s a natural part of growing older. If you ask these people in their forties what their biggest life worry, the answer often is, quite simply, “money.” They want to learn to manage their money better, and they’ll tell you how important financial stability is to them. Yet the evidence shows something very different. In the table below, researchers followed employees at companies that offered financial-education seminars. Despite the obvious need to learn about their finances, only 17% of company employees attended. This is a common phenomenon: As Laura Levine of the Jump$tart Coalition told me, and I paraphrase, “Bob doesn’t want to attend his 401(k) seminar because he’s afraid he’ll see his neighbor there…and that would be equivalent to admitting he didn’t know about money for all those years.” They also don’t like to attend personal-finance events because they don’t like to feel bad about themselves. But of those who did attend the employer event, something even more surprising happens. Of the people who did not have a 401(k), 100% planned to enroll in their company’s 401(k) offering after the seminar. Yet only 14% actually did. Of those who already had a 401(k), 28% planned to increase their participation rate. 47% planned to change their fund selection (most likely because they learned they had picked the default money-market plan, which was earning them virtually nothing). But less than half of people actually made the change. This is the kind of data that drives economists and engineers crazy, because it clearly shows that people are not rational.  Yes, we should max out our 401(k) employer match, but billions of dollars are left on the table each year because we don’t. Yes, we should start eating healthy and exercising more, but we don’t. Why not? Why wouldn’t we do something that’s objectively good for us? Barriers are one of the implicit reasons you can’t achieve your goals. They can be psychological or profoundly physical, like something as simple as not having a pen when you need to fill out a form. But the underlying factor is that they are breathtakingly simple — and if I pointed them out to you about someone else, you would be sickened by how seemingly obvious they are to overcome. It’s easy to dismiss these barriers are trivial, and say, “Oh, that’s so dumb!” when you realize that not having an envelope nearby could cost someone over $3,000. But it’s true. And by the end of this article, you’ll be able to identify at least three barriers in your own life — whether you want to or not. Why people don’t participate in their 401(k)sIf you’re like me, whenever you hear that one of your co-workers doesn’t participate in their 401(k) — especially if there’s an employer match — you scratch your head in confusion. In my case, I feel a rage boiling up that reminds me of the ruins of Pompeii. Even though this is free money, many people still don’t participate. Journalists will cite intangibles like laziness and personal responsibility, suggesting that people are getting less responsible with their money over time. Hardly. It turns out that getting people to enroll in their 401(k) is just plain hard. Yet using simple psychological techniques, however, we can dramatically increase the number of people who participate in their company’s retirement plan. One technique, “automatic enrollment,” automatically establishes a retirement plan and contribution. You can opt out at any time, but you’re enrolled by default. Here’s how it affects 401(k) enrollment. (“AE” = automatic enrollment.) From 40% participation to nearly 100% in one example. Astonishing. Today, J.D. has given me the opportunity to talk about one of the ways to drive behavioral change when it comes to your money. I call them barriers. While I do this, I’m going to ask you for a favor. You’ll see examples of people who lost thousands of dollars because they wouldn’t spend one hour reading a form. It’s easy to call these people “lazy” — and there’s certainly an element of that — but disdainfully calling someone lazy doesn’t explain the whole story. Getting people to change their behavior is extraordinarily hard — even if it will save them thousands of dollars or save their lives. If it were easy, you would have a perfect financial situation: You’d have no debt, your asset allocation would be ideal and rebalanced annually, and you’d have a long-term outlook without worrying about the current economic crisis. You’d be your college weight, with washboard abs and tight legs. You’d have a clean garage. But you don’t. None of us are perfect. That’s why understanding barriers is so important to changing your own behavior. “Just spend less than you make — duh”There is something especially annoying about the comments on personal-finance blogs. On nearly every major blog post I’ve made in the last year, someone has left a comment that goes like this: “Ugh, not another money tip. All you need to know is, spend less than you make.” Actually, that’s not true. If that were the case, as I pointed out above, nobody would be in debt, overweight, or have relationship problems of any kind. Simply knowing a high-level fact doesn’t make it useful. I studied persuasion and social influence in college and grad school, for example, but I still get persuaded all the time. These commenters make the common mistake of assuming that people are rational actors, meaning they behave as a computer model would predict. We know this is simply untrue: Books like Freakonomics and Judgment in Managerial Decision Making are great places to get an overview of our cognitive biases and psychological motivations. For example, we say we want to be in shape, but we don’t really want to go to the gym. We believe we’re not affected by advertising, but we’re driving a Mercedes or using Tupperware or wearing Calvin Klein jeans. There are dramatic differences in what we say versus what we do. Often, the reason is so simple that we can’t believe it would affect us. I call these barriers, and I’ve written about them before: Last weekend, I went home to visit my family. While I was there, I asked my mom if she would make me some food, so like any Indian mom would, she cooked me 2 weeks’ worth. I came back home skipping like a little girl. Now here’s where it gets interesting. When I got back to my place, I took the food out of the brown grocery bag and put the clear plastic bags on the counter. I was about to put the bags in the fridge but I realized something astonishing:   …if I got hungry, I’d probably go to the fridge, see the plastic bags, and realize that I’d have to (1) open them up and then I’d have to (2) open the Tupperware to (3) finally get to the food. And the truth was, I just wouldn’t do it. The clear plastic bags were enough of a barrier to ignore the fresh-cooked Indian food for some crackers!! Obviously, once I realized this, I tore the bags apart like a voracious wolf and have provided myself delicious sustenance for the past week. I think the source of 95%+ of barriers to success is…ourselves. It’s not our lack of resources (money, education, etc). It’s not our competition. It’s usually just what’s in our own heads. Barriers are more than just excuses — they’re the things that make us not get anything done. And not only do we allow them to exist around us, we encourage them. There are active barriers and passive barriers, but the result is still the same: We don’t achieve what we want to. Active barriers are physical things like the plastic wrap on my food, or someone telling me that it’ll never work, etc. These are hard to identify, but easy to fix. I usually just make them go away. Passive barriers are things that don’t exist, so they make your job harder. A trivial example is not having a stapler at your desk; imagine how many times a day that gets frustrating. For me, these are harder to identify and also harder to fix. I might rearrange my room to be more productive, or get myself a better pen to write with. Today, I want to focus on passive barriers: what they are and how to overcome them. How to destroy the passive barriers around youPsychologists have been studying college students for decades to understand how to reduce unprotected sex. Among the most interesting findings, they pointed out that it would be rational for women to carry condoms with them, since the sexual experiences they had were often unplanned and these women can control the use of contraceptives. Except for one thing: When they asked college women why they didn’t carry condoms with them, one young woman typified the responses: “I couldn’t do that…I’d seem slutty.” As a result, she and others often ended up having unprotected sex because of the lack of a condom. Yes, technically they should carry condoms, just as both partners should stop, calmly go to the corner liquor store, and get protection. But many times, they don’t. In this case, the condom was the passive barrier: Because they didn’t have it nearby and conveniently available, they violated their own rule to have safe sex. Passive barriers exist everywhere. Here are some examples: Barriers in e-mailI get emails like this all the time: “Hey Ramit, what do you think of that article I sent last week? Any suggested changes?” My reaction? “Ugh, what is he talking about? Oh yeah, that article on savings accounts…I have to dig that up and reply to him. Where is that? I’ll search for it later. Marks email as unread” Note: You can yell at me for not just taking the 30 seconds to find his email right then, but that’s exactly the point: By not including the article in this followup email, he triggered a passive barrier of me needing to think about what he was talking about, search for it, and then decide what to reply to. The lack of the attached article is the passive barrier, and our most common response to barriers is to do nothing. Barriers on your deskA friend of mine lost over $3,000 because he didn’t cash a check from his workplace, which went bankrupt a few months later. When I asked him why he didn’t cash the check immediately, he looked at me and said, “I didn’t have an envelope handy.” What other things do you delay because it’s not convenient? Barriers to exerciseI think back to when I’ve failed to hit my workout goals, and it’s often the simplest of reasons. One of the most obvious barriers was my workout clothes. I had one pair of running pants, and after each workout, I would throw it in my laundry basket. When I woke up the next morning, the first thing I would think is: “Oh god, I have to get up, claw through my dirty clothes, and wear those sweaty pants again.” Once I identified this, I bought a second pair of workout clothes and left them by my door each day. When I woke up, I knew I could walk out of my room, find the fully prepared workout bag and clothes, and get going. Barriers to healthy eatingWhen I was in college, I loved those Ramen Cup of Noodles. Unfortunately, I stored them in my closet, so each time I wanted one, I would have to walk to another room, reach up to the top of the closet, open the package, and prepare it. Ridiculous! Instead, I created this: Don’t take any spare change in your pockets for the vending machine. Even if you leave quarters in your car, that walk to the parking lot is barrier enough not to do it. Give yourself an alternative:  How do you think that’ll affect your eating behavior? Applying passive barrier theory to your lifeAs we’ve seen, the lack of having something nearby can have profound influences on your behavior. Imagine seeing a complicated mortgage form with interest rates and calculations on over 100 pages. Sure, you should calculate all of it, but if you don’t have a calculator handy, the chances of your actually doing it go down dramatically. Now, we’re going to dig into areas where passive barriers are preventing you from making behavioral change — sometimes without you even knowing it. Fundamentally, there are two ways to address a passive barrier. Personally, here are a few passive barriers I’ve identified for myself: I keep my checkbook by my desk, because for the few checks I receive in the mail, I tend to never mail them in. I keep a gym bag of clothes ready to work out. And I cut up my fruit when I bring it home from the store, because I know I’ll get lazy later. Let’s see how this can work for you. Let’s play out the last step with the example of exercising regularly: Solution: Put the computer in the kitchen before you go to sleep —&gt; sleep earlier —&gt; come home from work at an earlier time —&gt; feel more rested —&gt; work out regularly. That’s a gross oversimplification, but you see what I mean. Pick ten areas of your life that you want to improve. Force yourself to understand why you haven’t done so already. Don’t let yourself cop out: “I just don’t want to” isn’t the real reason. And once you find out the real reasons you haven’t been able to check your spending, or cook dinner, or call your mom, you might be embarrassed at how simple it really was. Don’t let that stop you. Passive barriers are valued in their usefulness, not in how difficult they are to identify. Summing it up: Passive barriers in your lifePassive barriers are subtle factors that prevent you from changing your behavior. Unlike “active” barriers, passive barriers describe the lack of something, making them more challenging to identify. But once you do, you can immediately take action to change your behavior. You can apply barriers to prevent yourself from spending money, cook and eat healthier, exercise more, stay in touch with your friends and family, and virtually any other behavior. You can do this with small changes or big ones. The important factor is to take action today. A caveat: Sometimes people take this advice to mean, “The reason I haven’t been sticking to my workout regimen is that I don’t have the best running shoes. I should really go buy those $150 shoes I’ve been eyeing…that will help me change my behavior.” Resolving passive barriers is not a silver bullet: Although they help, you’ll be ultimately responsible for changing your own behavior. Instead of buying better shoes immediately, I’d recommend setting a concrete goal — “Once I run consistently for 20 days in a row, I’ll buy those shoes for myself” — before spending on barriers. Most changes can be done with a minimum of expense. Thanks for reading.

Ford Motor CompanyNorth American auto sales are booming. How much longer can it last?  In a new note, Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas writes that it can actually keep going a bit more. 2013 is expected to see 16.7 million autos sold, and by 2015 sales could test 18 million. So, he's definitely not calling the top. But, there's more to the story.  To meet that demand, the industry has been adding capacity at a furious pace.  And eventually, he says, the cost of adding or expanding factories will begin to weigh on the overall price of the good the factory is producing: ...at the margin at least, [capacity is] the enemy of pricing. As investors contemplate the 2014 to 2016 operating margin outlook for the US, we would suggest a serious consideration to the impact of higher structural costs (depreciation creep, engineering costs) as well as more competitive pricing. Exchange rates and retooling machinery aren't cheap, but Jonas says there's one main cost investors need to be focused on:  jobs. Adding shifts still costs big money. Ford has spent some $9bn since 2010 (through May 2012) on retooling, revamping and adding capacity in the US and Canada despite not adding a single greenfield facility. He's charted out his projection for the amount of new capacity the industry will add — and it shows we're looking at a deceleration after this year. Morgan StanleyHow many more autos the industry will be able to pump out. Again, Jonas insists, he's not trying to say it can't get better. The capacity issue is just something to seriously think about: There are a lot of good things happening in the US car industry: firms are making good money and they seem to be acting more responsibly. But there are just too many car companies chasing too few consumers in one of the most cyclical industries on the planet. We're not trying to call the top of a furious market rally. But we do hope this analysis helps encourage some reconsideration of too-optimistic 2014 forecasts to allow for some increased competitive price pressure as we face a heavier capacity burden. It may be time to get your brakes checked.
Photo by Kevork Djansezian/Getty ImagesNetflix CEO Reed Hastings: Brilliant, human, and focused on all the right things.Netflix's stock just hit an all-time high of $313 a share. This wouldn't be so remarkable except for what happened two years ago. Two years ago, after an astounding multi-year run on the strength of a new video streaming business, Netflix stock blew through $300 a share for the first time. Netflix, everyone was convinced, had discovered the Next Big Thing. Netflix was on its way to becoming The Next HBO. Netflix was going to disrupt and revolutionize the television business and make anyone who bet on it fabulously rich. But then Netflix made a significant mistake.Â  Netflix announced that it was going to split itself into two different companies. One company would contain Netflix's original DVDs-by-mail business. The other company would be the streaming business. Netflix was going to split into two companies, it explained, because the DVDs-by-mail business was a dying business, and the future was the streaming business. Well, the market hated that idea. Despite the fact that absolutely nothing at Netflix's businesses had changed, the market destroyed Netflix's stock price. The stock crashed by 75% in three months, to $65 a share. The company, some people said, was obviously going out of business. Why did Netflix make this mistake? Because Netflix is run by humans. Extraordinarily talented, brilliant humans, but humans. And humans occasionally make mistakes. But did the market conclude that the extraordinarily talented, brilliant humans who ran Netflix had just made a relatively rare mistake? Nope. The market concluded that the humans who ran Netflix were so unfathomably stupid that Netflix was obviously screwed. That Netflix founder and CEO who had been lionized as a genius on the cover of all those magazines, for example? Obviously an idiot. Netflix was a terrible company, the market agreed. No price was too low for the company's stock. But now, a mere two years later, Netflix is up 400% from the low and setting a new all-time high. How? Did Netflix pull off some magic recovery? Did Netflix introduce some revolutionary new product that no one saw coming? Nope. Netflix just did its thing--the same thing it was doing when the market threw up in disgust and pulverized Netflix's stock price. Netflix just kept investing in its streaming business. And, just as many long-term Netflix investors had hoped, the streaming business has turned out to be a pretty good thing. So, what's the moral of the Netflix story? The same moral as the story of Amazon, Facebook, Google, and many other excellent companies: Ignore Wall Street. Wall Street is so hyperactive and bi-polar, and so obsessed with meaningless short-term results, that Wall Street causes countless pretty good managers and companies to worry about all the wrong things. Want to create the most possible value for shareholders? Then start by creating the most possible value for your customers. Put your customers first, and, over the long haul,Â your stock price will take care of itself. Well done, Netflix!

Petr Štefek, Wikimedia CommonsCommodity prices soared during the first decade of this century. But now the party’s over: new sources of supply are coming on line just as demand from China is slowing, leading to expectations of price declines. So should investors shun commodity-related investments? We don’t think so. But it will take a more focused approach to extract commodity returns in the new environment. From 2001 through 2010, commodities posted double-digit price increases, year after year, with only a brief pause during the global financial crisis. Those days are over. Decades of underinvestment along with China’s unexpectedly strong emergence, which drove the so-called supercycle, have given way to new dynamics. New Dynamics Prompt Price Declines Today, significant investment combined with China’s growth slowdown has fueled expectations of supply surpluses and spot price declines. While each commodity faces a unique supply/demand situation, the cases of iron ore and crude oil highlight how investors can effectively navigate a more challenging pricing environment. AllianceBernstein Iron Ore: Opportunity to Benefit from Pessimistic Expectations Iron ore is the poster child for commodity oversupply concerns. As iron is the fourth most common element in the earth’s crust, it is merely a matter of time before investment allows lower-cost supply of the ore to catch up with demand—likely around 2017, according to Macquarie. In the meantime, however, higher-cost supply from China’s coast and smaller non-Chinese producers must plug the gap between lower-cost supply and demand. These higher-cost mines require prices of around $120 per metric tonne (MT) to break even on a cash basis. If prices fall too far below that level for too long, these mines will simply shut down. With spot iron ore prices averaging over $130/MT so far in 2013, we expect prices to fall towards this $120/MT marginal cost over the next couple of years. But despite the likelihood of falling prices, iron ore is still an attractive investment, in our view. Here’s why. Direct exposure to iron ore prices is taken through futures contracts. Today, futures contracts for the average spot price of iron ore in 2016 are trading at around $100/MT. This pricing structure means that, if spot prices fall to the $120/MT marginal cost and stay there for all of 2016, an investment in the 2016 futures contract at current levels will produce a 20% gain. The investment would only lose money if spot prices were to average less than $100/MT in 2016, which the consensus believes but our analysis suggests is highly unlikely. Crude Oil: Opportunity to Benefit from Inflation Surprises Crude oil also faces oversupply concerns. The application of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling to shale formations, commonly known as fracking, is revolutionizing the crude oil supply picture. In the US alone, crude production from shale is expected to reach 5 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2020; that’s more than the current total production of any other country except Russia, the US and Saudi Arabia (Display). What’s more, this and other marginal sources of supply are profitable at an oil price of $85 per barrel (bbl). Modest cost inflation brings the break-even cost to around $95/bbl by 2016. So with spot Brent crude oil prices currently averaging about $110/bbl, we expect prices to fall toward the $95/bbl marginal cost over the next couple of years. This $95/bbl level also happens to be the 2016 futures price for Brent crude. And we think this creates an interesting opportunity to benefit from potential price shocks with relatively little downside. The downside is limited because we think the $95/bbl cost is more of a floor than a target price. Shale well producers are able to quickly curtail production if oversupply pushes prices to uneconomic levels. In the event oil is abundant, the 2016 futures are unlikely to appreciate, but are also unlikely to fall in value. But the 2016 futures stand to benefit significantly in the event that oil prices rise above $95/bbl because of supply disruptions, geopolitical risk or general cost inflation. Furthermore, such inflationary shocks would likely hurt most equities and fixed-income investments. This makes the 2016 oil futures quite attractive from an overall risk/return perspective, in our view. Commodities Still Combat Inflation These examples show how investors can seek to generate returns from commodities with ample medium-term supply and probable declines in spot prices. Meanwhile, other commodities such as copper and natural gas, with different supply/demand dynamics, should see spot price increases, though perhaps not on the scale of those of the past decade. While each commodity has a unique profile, there is a common denominator: commodities in general tend to perform well during inflation spikes, when both stocks and nominal bonds often face headwinds. Even after the supercycle, this is still the most important role of commodities in an overall portfolio allocation.

For that very reason, @GSElevatorÂ â€”Â in collaboration with John Carney (@Carney) of CNBC.com â€” presents a fresh, and hopefully thoughtful, look at what it means to be a man today. Stop talking about where you went to college. Always carry cash. Â Keep some in your front pocket. Rebel from business casual. Burn your khakis and wear a suit or jeans. Itâ€™s okay to trade the possibility of your 80s and 90s for more guaranteed fun in your 20s and 30s. The best public restrooms are in hotels: The St. Regis in New York, Claridgeâ€™s in London, The Fullerton in Singapore, to name a few.  Never stay out after midnight three nights in a row â€¦ unless something really good comes up on the third night. You will regret your tattoos. Never date an ex of your friend.  Join Twitter; become your own curator of information.  If riding the bus doesn't incentivize you to improve your station in life, nothing will. Time is too short to do your own laundry. â€¨ When the bartender asks, you should already know what you want to drink. If you perspire, wear a damn undershirt.  You donâ€™t have to like baseball, but you should understand the concept of what a pitcherâ€™s ERA means. Â Approach life similarly. When people donâ€™t invite you to a party, you really shouldnâ€™t go.â€¨ And sometimes even when you are invited, you shouldnâ€™t go.â€¨ â€¨ People are tired of you being the funny, drunk guy. â€¨ When in doubt, always kiss the girl. Tip more than you should. You probably use your cell phone too often and at the wrong moments.â€¨ Buy expensive sunglasses. Â Superficial? Yes, but so are the women judging you. And it tells these women you appreciate nice things and are responsible enough not to lose them. If you want a nice umbrella, bring a sh*tty one to church. Do 50 push-ups, sit-ups, and dips before you shower each morning. â€¨ Eat brunch with friends at least every other weekend. Leave Rusty and Junior at home.  Be a regular at more than one bar. Â  Act like youâ€™ve been there before. Â It doesnâ€™t matter if itâ€™s in the end zone at the Super Bowl or on a private plane. A glass of wine or two with lunch will not ruin your day.â€¨ Itâ€™s better if old men cut your hair. Â Ask for Sammy at the Mandarin Oriental Barbershop in Hong Kong. Â He can share his experiences of the Japanese occupation, or just give you a copy of Playboy. Learn how to fly-fish. Â  No selfies. Aspire to experience photo-worthy moments in the company of a beautiful woman. Own a handcrafted shotgun. Â Itâ€™s a beautiful thing. Thereâ€™s always another level. Just be content knowing that you are still better off than most who have ever lived. You can get away with a lot more if you're the one buying the drinks.

Apple's stock is down 2.87%Â after it announced the iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C.Â  There seems to be two problems: First, the iPhone 5C, Apple's low-cost iPhone is actually going to cost $549 off contract. Investors were expecting $500 or less. Second, Apple made no mention of China Mobile, the big Chinese carrier that is supposed to give iPhone sales a boost.Â  Coming into the event, Apple's stock was off 1.32%. During the event it fought back, and was only down ~.32%. As soon as the event ended, the stock dropped.Â  The stock has bounced back after Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster said it's 99% certain Apple announces a deal with China Mobile tomorrow.Â  Yahoo Screenshot
Earlier today, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released its July Job Openings &amp; Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) results. The JOLTS report offers additional insight into the labor market that we can't get from the employment situation report, aka the jobs report. One interesting stat is the quit rate. "Quits are generally voluntary separations initiated by employees," said the BLS. "Therefore, the quits rate can serve as a measure of workers’ willingness or ability to leave jobs." A rising quit rate is understood to reflect increasing confidence among the workforce. According to the new JOLTS report, quits are outpacing layoffs and discharges combined. "The number of quits has exceeded the number of layoffs and discharges for most of the 12-year JOLTS history," noted the BLS. "During the latest recession, this relationship changed as layoffs and discharges outnumbered quits from November 2008 through March 2010." BLS
Justin Sullivan / Getty Images Apple just announced two new iPhones, the iPhone 5S and the iPhone 5C. The immediate reaction to the phones is not great. The stock fell 3%, or $15.Â  The phones themselves seem fine. The iPhone 5S in particular looks great. It has a new fingerprint scanning feature built into the home button that allows users to easily, and securely unlock their phones. It will also allow them to purchase stuff from iTunes without a password.Â  The iPhone 5S has a new Â 64-bit A7 chip, which Apple says makes it "desktop-class" in terms of speed.Â  It also has a new camera system and an improved flash. The iPhone 5C is essentially the iPhone 5, but with a colorful plastic backing. Contrary to what many people hoped, the 5C will not be cheap. It won't even be mid-range. Off contract, the 5C is going to cost $549, which means it will be pretty expensive for most people around the world. This seems to be the reason the stock dropped. The new iPhones go on sale September 20.Â  Our live blog from the event is below.Â  

Tracy Chung for Business InsiderAt the end of the summer it is important to send off the season with some kind of celebration. Most of us have a nice barbecue with a few close friends â€” maybe a pool party. Then there's billionaire paper mogul Peter Brant. He does his end-of-summer party a little differently but it's still in essence, a summer blowout. On Sunday Brant opened up his massive property on Conyers Farm, an elite residential enclave, to what seemed like the entire town of Greenwich, Connecticut. So we had to go check out the details. Couldn't help ourselves. A few things you should know about Brant â€” he is probably best known in business circles for modernizing the paper company his father founded, White Birch Paper, in an age when the newspapers White Birch once serviced were (and still are) dropping like flies. Thanks to that the Brants stayed wealthy, and Peter used that wealth to take on some interesting hobbies. Two of those hobbies were on full display this weekend. The first was Brant's love of collecting contemporary art, especially works created by his friend, Andy Warhol, and the second was the "sport of kings," polo. Brant picked up the sport in his 30s (because... why not?) and now hosts matches on the grounds he co-founded, the Greenwich Polo Club, which is also on Conyers Farm. WikimediaImagine this, 15 feet long, right in front of your face.The grounds also house The Brant Foundation, which is where we met Brant around 2:00 pm for a private viewing of his new exhibition, ANDY WARHOL. For the record, the billionaire does not look like a polo player. He also does not look like he ran with the wild crowd that Warhol reportedly hung out with. Then again, as Brant told us, Andy hung out with "very unstable, and very stable people." Brant, with his preppy style, quiet voice, and steady gaze was clearly in the latter group of Warhol's friends. And there he was, not just leading the tour, but on the walls as well. Amidst the 15-foot Mao painting and the Warhol self portraits, there were Polaroids of a young Peter relaxing among friends. After the tour of the collection it was time to sit down for some polo, the Royal Salute Jubilee Cup, to be specific. This is when things got really crazy. Thousands of people were roaming the grounds, eating and drinking in the sun â€” kids, dogs you name it. And why not? To close the polo season in North America, the best (hands down, no question) polo player in the world was playing on Brant's Royal Salute team. Tracy Chung for Business InsiderFacundo Pieres, chilling.His name is Facundo Pieres. He's from Argentina and he's only 28. To be the best player in the world of polo you must start young. You must not be afraid of falling off a horse at a weird (maybe deadly) angle or flying into your opponent (or even teammate) at incredibly high speeds. You must not get lonely when you travel around the world's polo circuit, which spends fall/winter in South America, then traverses the globe until it gets to the United States for the summer. Pieres is number one in the world because he is the best "10 goal" player in the world. All players in polo are assigned a goal ranking from -2 to 10. Pros are generally a 5 or above. There are only ten 10 goal players in the entire world. Brant, for the record, is a 2. Now, polo is an expensive sport. There are 4-6 periods (known as chukkers) per game and you need a new horse for every chukker. For that reason, most teams have sponsors. Brant's team is sponsored by Royal Salute, a Chivas Brothers scotch, and Pieres was just named the Royal Salute Ambassador. Needless to say, this was a major plus for Sunday's polo patrons. Dominic JamesAs we sipped, the players on the field soared. Polo is all about speed, super clear communication, and some weird psychic ability. Guys like Pieres know where the ball is going before it gets there because they can feel it. They can juggle it on their sticks so no one can take it from them. They can make horses to back flips. This skill made for some exciting moments for an increasingly tipsy crowd. In the last chukker, the opposing side (Airstream) scored an incredible 5 goals. Airstream had been down by 6, and they could've tied the entire thing up. But lucky for Pieres and Brant, they ran out of time. The crowd went nuts. In the world of sports and at the end of the summer, seriously... how much better does it get?
Earlier today, we learned that the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) small business optimism index fell 0.1 point to 94.0 in August. "While the total reading showed essentially no change over the month prior, a look at the individual indicators reveals incongruent details," wrote the NFIB in their announcement. "Job creation plans leapt to a level not seen since before the recession and sales expectations improved; but this optimism would appear to contravene the dramatic deterioration in quarter to quarter sales and profit trends," they continued. "The favorable employment plans also contrasted sharply with the increasingly negative expectations for improved general business conditions. The month's performance proved poor, but expectations, pre-Syria, were looking up." While the NFIB is still scratching their heads, Deutsche Bank's Joe LaVorgna is taking it as a reason to be optimistic. "This is the largest monthly gain and the highest reading in this series since January 2007, a month which experienced nonfarm payrolls gains of +234k and private payroll gains of +227k," he said of the the job creation plans. "Indeed, before the last economic downturn, a +16% reading on small business hiring intentions was generally consistent with monthly nonfarm payrolls gains in the vicinity of +200k, a bit faster than the +184k gain seen over the past year." LaVorgna thinks the NFIB's report means the disappointing August jobs report we got on Friday will be tweaked in coming months. "This suggests to us that either August nonfarm payrolls will be revised higher or that we will see a noticeable improvement in nonfarm payrolls this month or sometime very soon," he added. "For the record, August nonfarm payrolls have had a tendency to be revised up over the past decade. In point of fact, it has happened in seven out of the last 10 years with an average upward revision of +50k. At minimum, the August NFIB data suggest the recent slowdown in hiring is temporary."

NEW YORK (AP) â€” The most famous stock index in the world, the Dow Jones industrial average, is getting a makeover. Alcoa, Bank of America, and Hewlett-Packard will be removed from the index of America's 30 top companies and replaced by Goldman Sachs, Visa and Nike. The changes, which will take effect Sept. 23, reflect the falling stock prices of the three companies being pulled. Q: WHAT IS THE DOW? The Dow Jones industrial average is a barometer of the health of the stock market and U.S. economy. It was created in 1896 by Charles H. Dow, one of the founders of The Wall Street Journal, with the intention of giving the stock market credibility and making investing more understandable. The original index had 12 members. The number of companies making up the Dow gradually increased to 30 in 1928. The Dow is no longer run by Dow Jones, the media company that publishes The Wall Street Journal. The index is calculated and published by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, a joint venture owned by McGraw-Hill, CME Group and Dow Jones. A small committee decides which companies are added or dropped to the Dow. Q: WHO GETS IN THE DOW? The Dow's members are often referred to as "blue chip" stocks." Entry into the index is reserved for a company that "has an excellent reputation, demonstrates sustained growth and is of interest to a large number of investors." Because the Dow has only 30 members, compared with the 500 members of the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index, entry is limited. Typically, the chosen companies best represent the makeup of the U.S. economy. As the economy has shifted away from heavy manufacturing in recent decades, so has the index. More members come from finance and technology. After Alcoa leaves, the "industrial" part of the Dow's name will only be 19 percent of the index itself. As health care has become a bigger part of the economy, companies such as UnitedHealth Group, Pfizer and Merck have been added. Financials have become a larger part, too. Q: WHY ARE BANK OF AMERICA, HEWLETT-PACKARD AND ALCOA BEING REMOVED? Bank of America, HP and Alcoa are still quality companies and still in the S&amp;P 500 index â€” which is a broader gauge of the U.S. stock market. Their low prices are primarily the reason why they're coming out of the Dow. The Dow is a price-weighted average, which means the higher the stock price, the most influence the stock has over the index's level. Bank of America, HP and Alcoa were the lowest-priced stocks in the Dow, so their movements did not impact the index as much as higher priced members like IBM and 3M.

REUTERS/Desmond Boylan Recent housing data, in part driven by rising rates, has been raising red flags as indicators reflect deceleration. Should we really be worried? Jim Klinge, aka Jim the Realtor, says that, at least in the San Diego metro area — which has seen prices jump 19.3% over the past year — there is little cause for concern. In a new blog post, he says a small group of investors — ones largely immune to economic data — will continue to drive the market.  ...with a [San Diego] county  population of 3.14 million people, we don’t need everyone in the pool – we only sold 3,466 homes in the county last month. You could exclude 90% of the population from the market and we’d still have enough demand…at least until the baby-boomer liquidation sale starts around 2020. The flow of rock-bottom deals may be dropping off, he says. But the profile of the average buyer has not really changed — and won't for awhile: I still get emailed every day by investment groups wanting me to send them deals.  If there are fewer investors buying, it’s because there are fewer deals, which would mean prices are holding up or going higher – too high to make sense for flippers.  Investors are supplying the floor to the market. There is definitely room to run.
Of course, for bond investors, rising interest rates mean falling bond prices, while declining interest rates mean rising bond prices. In general, the prices of longer-term and lower-yielding bonds have the greatest interest-rate sensitivity. Over the past four months, the sharp rise in the yield on the 10-year Treasury from 1.6% onÂ May 2Â to 3.0%Â on FridayÂ of last week has resulted in losses for many high-quality bonds. But it has been no picnic for other asset classes either. For much of the past five years, high-yield bonds have acted a lot more like stocks than bonds, measured by statistical correlation. However, the rise in rates this year has reminded high yield bondholders that they are still bonds, as they have tracked the losses in bonds sinceÂ May 2Â rather than the gains in stocks. Normally, rising rates are not a problem for stocks until the yield on the 10-year Treasury gets above 5%, when increasing inflation typically starts to become a problem. But the pace at which yields head higher matters at any level. The sharp rise in rates in August prompted a pullback in stocks. For the first time in six years, the correlation between the S&amp;P 500 and the yield on the 10-year Treasury has turned negativeÂ [Figure 1]. LPL Financial So it seems just about everything in portfolios suddenly got very averse to rising interest rates. There is no way to completely insulate a portfolio from rising rates using traditional investments. Even holding only cash will eventually lose ground to inflation as rates rise (and current money market yields are well below the pace of inflation). So how do you provide some insulation from rising rates in your portfolio? In general, within portfolios, consider: While it may be impractical or undesirable to eliminate all bond exposure from your portfolio, favoring stocks over bonds can help to mitigate interest rate risk. While stocks can suffer as rates spike, high-quality bonds may fare worse. For example, high-quality bonds, as measured by the Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Bond Index, are down 4.6% sinceÂ May 2Â while stocks are actually up 4.5%, as measured by the S&amp;P 500 Index. LPL FinancialWithin the bond market, high-yield bonds offer some insulation from rising interest rates relative to low-yielding bonds. However, that is not the case for stocks, where stocks with the highest dividend yields have been the worst performers.Â The high-yielding utilities and telecommunications sectors have fallen about 10% since yields began to rise on May 2, 2013Â [Figure 2].Â Lower-yielding, higher-growth sectors, such as consumer discretionary and industrials, have fared the best. The financials sector has been among the best performers sinceÂ May 2, but it has suffered over the past month as the rise in rates accelerated towards 3%. Rising rates help improve bankâ€™s profitability as loan rates go up, but too sudden an increase in rates may hurt their assets. The impact on profitability takes place relatively slowly, as new loans are made and old loans reprice at new interest rates over time. However, as rates rise, banks immediately suffer the risk of potential losses to the market value of the bonds and other assets they hold, just like any investor. For the overall stock market, just like for financials, a slow and steady increase in rates is generally a plus, and a sharp jump acts as a negative. Fortunately, the sharp rise in rates may be due for a pause. Historically, the yield on the 10-year Treasury tracks nominal gross domestic product (GDP) growth, or real GDP growth plus the pace of inflation (please see our June 19, 2013 Bond Market Perspectives for more on this relationship). Third-quarter real GDP is tracking to 1.5â€‰â€“â€‰2% while inflation is running at 1â€‰â€“â€‰1.5%. So, last weekâ€™s rise in yields to around 3% places it right in the middle of the range of the â€œnormalâ€ level for the 10-year Treasury, despite the effects of the Federal Reserveâ€™s soon to be wound down bond buying program. No doubt, if interest rates slowâ€‰â€”â€‰or even reverseâ€‰â€”â€‰their recent steep climb, investors will still have plenty of other risks to turn their focus to: potential military action in Syria, sluggish global economic growth, Congressâ€™ fiscal fight over the debt ceiling and funding for the federal government, among others. But any easing in the one big risk on investorsâ€™ minds right now would likely be a plus.
The monthly employment report is among the most popular and controversial of the government's economic reports. The latest one released on Friday was no exception, with its weaker-than-expected new jobs but a decline in the unemployment rate from 7.4% to 7.3%. One of the reasons the monthly employment report is so controversial is that it's an incredible hodgepodge of data from bipolar sources: the Current Population Survey (CPS) of households and the Establishment Survey of businesses and government agencies. For example, the Nonfarm Employment number comes from the establishment data, but the unemployment rate is calculated from household data. Additional complications are the substantial revisions to both the CPS and Establishment data, and the complexities of seasonal adjustment, which is available for many, but not all, of the data series. Full-Time vs. Part-Time Employment in the 21st Century Let's take a close look at some CPS numbers on Full and Part-Time Employment. Buried near the bottom of Table A-9 of the Household Data are the numbers for Full- and Part-Time Workers, with 35-or-more hours as the arbitrary divide between the two categories. The Labor Department has been collecting this since 1968, a time when only 13.5% of US employees were part-timers. That number peaked at 20% in January 2010. The latest month is fractionally lower at 19.4%. Here is a visualization of the trend in the 21st century, with the percentage of full-time employed on the left axis and the part-time employed on the right. We see a conspicuous crossover during Great Recession. The Impact of the Great Recession Here is a closer look since 2007. The reversal began in 2008, but it accelerated in the Fall of that year following the September 15th bankruptcy of Lehmann Brothers. In this seasonally adjusted data the reversal peaked in early 2010. Three-and-a-half years later the spread has narrowed a bit, but we're a long way from returning to the ratio before the Great Recession. The two charts above are seasonally adjusted and include the entire workforce, which the CPS defines as age 16 and over. A problem inherent in using this broadest of cohorts is that it includes the population that adds substantial summertime volatility to the full-time/part-time ratio, namely, high school and college students. Also the 55-plus cohort includes a subset of employees that opt for part-time employment during the decade following the historical peak spending years (ages 45-54) and as a transition toward retirement. The Core Workforce: Ages 25-54 The next chart reduces the summertime volatility problem by focusing on the 25-54 workforce. Note that the government's full-time/part-time data for this cohort is only available as non-seasonally adjusted. To help us recognize the summer seasonality that remains, I've tweaked this representation by adding markers for the individual months and using a lighter color for the summer-month markers, which are the most subject to temporary shifts from part-time to 35-plus hours of employment. I've also included 12-month moving averages for the two series to help us identify the slope of the trend over the past three years. Like the 16-and-over version, this chart depicts a current situation that is considerably different from the era before the Financial Crisis, although the trend has been slowly improving since early 2010, as illustrated by the dotted-line moving averages. Since this is non-seasonally adjusted data, the summer months are conspicuous outliers, with full-time employment spiking during the June-August period. In 2012 the July data points overlapped. The latest data points for August 2013 show a crossover. Next month the spread will no doubt return. But we can hope the dotted lines will continue to slope toward each other and eventually cross back to the old normal for this core population segment. Meanwhile, we can speculate that the Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare) is playing a role in employer decisions about full-time versus part-time employment. The $2,000 per employee penalty for employers who do not comply with regulations has influenced some employers to begin shifting their employment policies. In July the government pushed the start of the penalty from January 2014 to January 2015. But the anticipation of the penalty, even though delayed a year, will probably continue to influence the interim decisions of private employers. Another Look at the Core Trend I'll close with a final chart of the 25-54 population data, this time showing the cumulative change in two series since January 2007. I've again included 12-month moving averages to highlight the trend underlying the seasonal volatility of this non-seasonally adjusted data, which is more conspicuous in the part-time series. The two callouts are for the latest moving averages. As I mentioned at the outset, the monthly employment report is a hodgepodge of data. The full-time/part-time ratio is but a tiny piece of the whole, and the magic 35-hour threshold is arguably arbitrary. But this is, nevertheless, a metric that bears watching in the months ahead as we try to understand where the economy is headed. The big question is whether the ratio shift is the result of structural change initially triggered by the Great Recession but now driven a combination of several factors, not least of which are workplace demographics and increased productivity driven by technology.  My data source for the charts and numbers in the commentary is the BLS's Databases &amp; Tools page -- specifically the Labor Force Statistics here.
REUTERS/StringerA Chinese flag is seen as Liu Wanyong performs on his invention, an improvised bicycle which is held afloat by plastic tubes, in Zhenning, Guizhou province, August 29, 2013.Overnight and this past weekend we saw a lot of positive economic data that point to an economic recovery in China. Industrial production, fixed asset investment, and retail sales came in stronger than expected. We also saw exports surge, and a marked improvement in China's manufacturing sector. Credit growth picked up nicely as well. But this robust data could be short-lived. First, industrial production which was up 10.4% was driven by infrastructure investment. Infrastructure fixed asset investment (FAI) was up 32% on the year in August, compared with 22.8% YoY in July.  "The dominating role of infrastructure played in the sudden turn-around confirms our concern over the sustainability," writes Societe Generale's Wei Yao who reminds us that  aggressive government spending can't go on forever. Overall money and total credit growth were up. M2, a broad measure of money supply was up 14.7% YoY. Total social financing, which includes outstanding bank loans, trust and entrusted loans, bankers’ acceptance, and corporate bonds, surged to 1.58 trillion yuan, almost double that of July. We've already pointed out that it's taking more and more credit growth to deliver less economic growth in China, and that this is one of the main bear arguments on China at the moment. From Yao: "Our call for a very short-lived growth recovery hinges on the expectation that China’s credit growth would continue to decelerate as policymakers aim for (slow) deleveraging. If credit growth picks up persistently from here, China’s current growth recovery may well last bit longer and go bit further. However, that only adds to the downside risk afterwards, as the leverage of Chinese corporates and local governments keeps rising from the already alarmingly high level." We've already talked ad nasuem about the risks that this would pose to China's financial stability and economic growth.  Bottom-line: While the numbers seem strong, it is becoming increasingly expensive to juice the stats.

DeGolyer Library, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TexasUBS is out with its annual Global Oil &amp; Gas Analyser report, which goes into great depth about world's largest exploration and production companies. Lately, everyone's been talking about how the U.S. has now become 'Saudi America.' And the UBS team, led by Jon Rigby, says America's shale boom is nowhere close to running out. North American shale production will continue to dominate non-OPEC output, with the U.S. alone contributing half the average annual output growth in the coming years alone. By 2020, the U.S. becomes the world's largest oil producer. On shale gas, "the US in particular enjoys a combination of factors â€“ the scale of the resource, the scale and depth of the market, the scale and depth of the infrastructure and the oil service industry and the particular legal and regulatory conditions that are not exactly replicated anywhere else." UBS's analysts sees an average 8% upside for the energy exploration and production companies it covers. Here, we highlight the 14 North American-based firms that offer positive returns.
APIt's primary day here in New York City — where New Yorkers affiliated with a party will select their candidates for the general election in the high-profile mayoral and comptroller races, among others.  Because of the city's Democratic-heavy split, many races serve as a de-facto general election. Then again, despite its liberal reputation, New York hasn't elected a Democratic mayor since 1989.  Here's everything you need to know to get ready for today: The big question heading into primary day is whether Spitzer, the former New York governor who resigned amid a prostitution scandal in 2008, has had the wind taken out of his sails in his quest to become the city's next comptroller. He was sailing along smoothly upon entering the race in mid-July, but a few recent polls show him in a dead heat, or even trailing, Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer. Then again, polling has been wildly inconsistent throughout this race. Just three weeks ago, Quinnipiac University gave Spitzer a 19-point lead. On Monday, it released a poll showing Stringer up 7 points. It's hard to imagine that much natural swing in just a matter of three weeks without any major-moving events. Prediction: It'll come down to turnout. But really, this one is anyone's guess. And the big question in the mayoral race is whether clear favorite and Public Advocate Bill de Blasio has enough momentum to score a decisive victory in the Democratic primary and avoid a runoff that would keep him from campaigning in a general election for another month.  De Blasio's candidacy has undergone a dramatic rise from afterthought to clear front-runner in the past month and a half. One voter outside an Upper East Side polling location in Manhattan said that she barely knew about de Blasio a couple months ago, but that "he's really surprised me." De Blasio needs to earn 40% of the Democratic vote to avoid a runoff. He is right on the cusp. Here's a look at where things stand, according to an average (rounded) of three polls released Sunday night and Monday: If, as expected, de Blasio eventually prevails on the Democratic side, his likely Republican opponent is former MTA chairman Joe Lhota. According to a Quinnipiac poll last week, Republican voters preferred him over businessman John Catsimatidis by a 2-to-1 margin. If New York City's recent electoral history is any indication, Lhota could provide de Blasio with a significant challenge. New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg will likely endorse him if de Blasio wins the Democratic primary, and Lhota could look to the business community for allies against de Blasio's tax-the-rich agenda. A quick rundown of other interesting races:
flickr/cobalt123Gold is getting slammed down this morning â€“ along with bonds and oil â€“ as signs that the conflict in Syria may de-escalate emerge. Right now, the metal is down 1.9% to $1360 an ounce. Meanwhile, West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures are down 2.2% to $107.10 a barrel. 10-year U.S. Treasury futures are down 0.4%, and the yield on the 10-year Treasury, at 2.96%, is 5 basis points higher from yesterday's close. Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem said today that the Assad regime accepted a Russian plan to hand over the regime's chemical weapons stockpiles to international control. The use of chemical weapons has been the key driver of the Obama administration's argument that the U.S. should take military action against Assad. "Armed conflicts especially in the Middle East have historically had a visible impact on gold prices through increased geopolitical risk and often oil price spikes," said BofA Merrill Lynch commodity strategists in a note to clients Monday. "We believe this time is not different: gold could rally immediately after the conflict starts although the rally could subside if the conflict does not escalate."
REUTERS/ Brendan McDermidFive years on, some of the financial crisis' most familiar characters are chirping in on the likelihood of another meltdown. Last week Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman went on the Charlie Rose show and claimed that the probability of another financial crisis is "as close to zero as I could imagine." "The way these firms are managed, the amount of capital that they have, the amount of liquidity that they have, the changes in their business mix — it’s dramatic," said Gorman, whose firm lived to tell the tale in part thanks to a $10 billion federal rescue package (since repaid). Gorman has been mocked for his "this time is different" incredulity, but he was reiterating a familiar post-crisis trope. Here's Goldman Sachs' Lloyd Blankfein in May when asked by German newspaper Die Welt whether the banking system was more secure now than before the crisis: "Much more secure! For instance, the size of our balance sheet has declined by 40%, but we hold twice as much capital as before the crisis." Of course, that whole line of thinking is interesting when you consider the tantrum thrown by some on Wall Street when higher capital requirements were introduced. In 2011 for example, outspoken JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon reportedly told Canada's head central banker Mark Carney (now running the Bank of England) that a proposed capital surcharge for the largest banks was "un-American." Enter John Thain, the former CEO of Merrill Lynch (sold to Bank of America amid the crisis), who told the Wall Street Journal's Francesco Guerrera this week, "Certainly financial institutions are less levered." But according to Thain, "Too big to fail" — one of the lasting clichés of the financial crisis — still awaits a solution. “I think that is the key, to have the mechanism to either merge or wind down or break into parts these financial institutions, but in a controlled way, and the mechanism to do that, I think, is not clear yet,” Thain told the Journal. “If you take one of those large firms, they are so big, they are so interconnected, they are such a part of the financial system that even today it would be hard to manage.” The upshot of the crisis has been significant deleveraging, Thain said. The capital problems in our nation's largest banks have been adjusted by force and circumstance. But Dodd-Frank, whether toothless or not, addresses problems endemic before 2008. And the funny thing about future financial crises, Thain suggests, is that they happen in the future. Credit Suisse's Brady Dougan seems to agree with Thain in an interview with the Financial Times' James Shotter and Daniel Schäfer. According to Dougan, one of just a handful of top chief executives to make it all the way from crisis to present day, "Some amount of risk has gone away because some activities are not being undertaken any more. But also a fair amount of risk has been transferred to other parts of the system, areas like shadow banking, insurance companies, pension funds or retail investors." So there's that to look forward to.
The "Job Openings and Labor Market Survey"Â â€” or JOLTS reportÂ â€” isn't as market-moving as the jobs report, but its data is just as important in characterizing the labor market. In fact, Fed Vice Chair and (fleetingly) possible Bernanke successor Janet Yellen loves the JOLTS report. So here are the 4 charts we'll be looking at today. Job openings are generally on the rise, slowly but surely. FRED But hires have flatlined for over a year. FRED Layoffs are way down.Â This is actually a bigger problem than you might think. During the crisis, businesses cut labor costs to the bone. After a certain point, firms "hoarded" the labor they still had, hoping to maximize the productivity of the workers that outlasted the crisis. With hires yet to break through, it seems that we could still be in a "labor hoarding" cycle. FRED Quits have been stagnant lately, but are up on the whole.Â Quitting your job is a sign of confidence in the economy and labor market. FRED
Two of Twitter's most notorious characters, Keith McCullough, the CEO of Hedgeye, and anonymous financial blogger ZeroHedge got in an epic spat on Twitter last night and it's still continuing this morning.Â  ZeroHedge is famous for his relentless gloom and mockery of the financial and political system. McCullough is known for trumpeting his endless #timestamps, and for attacking the traditional Wall street system. ZeroHedge started the fight when he called out McCullough on his 26-year-old energy analyst Kevin Kaiser's bearish call last week on Kinder Morgan. Â A lot of people on Wall Street have been criticizing that callÂ that knocked $4 billion off the company's market cap.Â  McCullough defended his analyst by pointing out that they were right on Linn Energy ($LINE). Â ZeroHedge snapped back by hinting that they got the idea from The Value Investors Club, a websiteÂ where people post different investment picks. Then McCullough whipped out his classic "timestamp" phrase on ZeroHedge telling him to timestamp his trade ideas. Â ZeroHedge used that opportunity to make a swipe at Hedgeye's business model saying that they are "based on daytrading hedge fund hotel ideas without capital at risk." (Burn!) The fight continues to get nasty. Â You can see all of the Tweets below:Â  via Twitter via Twittervia Twittervia Twittervia Twittervia Twitter
Screenshot via Bloomberg TVHoward Marks, the respected fund manager at Oaktree Capital, presentation titled "Managing Money in Uncertain Times"at yesterday's Barclays financial services conference in New York. UBS's Art Cashin singled out the key memorable slide in his note this morning. Here's the text: A Prescription for an Uncertain World The outlook certainly isn’t so propitious (and assets aren’t so cheap) as to call for investing aggressively. But at the same time, conditions aren’t so bad and prices aren’t so high that it’s time for extreme risk aversion. "Advice from a wise man," wrote Cashin.
Money For Nothing"When you or I print money it's called counterfeiting," a commentator muses in a new documentary about the Federal Reserve. "When the Fed does it, it's called monetary policy." That documentary is Money For Nothing: Inside the Federal Reserve and that commentator was former St. Louis Fed Governor William Poole. Charting 100 years of Fed history, the film features an impressive collection of economic actors and thinkers: Paul Volcker, Janet Yellen, Jim Grant, Peter Atwater, John Mauldin, Barry Ritholtz, Gary Shilling, and others. It's also narrated by the dulcet tones of Liev Schreiber. If Farhenheit 9/11 was Michael Moore's seminal repudiation of George W. Bush's foreign policy, Money For Nothing is writer/director Jim Bruce's similar critique of the history of the Federal Reserve. “The Fed is supposed to be the guardian of financial stability, preventing chaos in markets,” says 1994-1996 Fed Vice Chair Alan Blinder. "Now, usually it can do that. In the summer of 2008, it couldn’t do that and we did get chaos." The film's chief villain is Alan Greenpsan, a one-time demigod who kept interest rates too low for too long, in Bruce's telling. Volcker, on the other hand, is painted as a hero for sacrificing short term gain for long term stability during his tenure as Fed chief. The crux of the film? The "hubris" of the Federal Reserve. Greenspan, once an infallible figure in American politics, sacrificed the long-term health of the country for short-term easy money and deregulation. In one scene, Greenspan talks over orchestra music as he conducts an effortless "soft landing" of the economy in 1994-1995. But it was shortlived. The film chastises Greenspan for thinking any bubble could be handled after the fact through interest rate adjustments. And it also suggests the Fed's dual mandate of controlling inflation and unemployment is often at odds — something you'll hear from plenty of economists. It's a convincing account, if a little conspiratorial (the film lost me when it cut to a rally for Ron Paul, a politician who made "End the Fed" a campaign battle cry). But it's definitely worth a watch to understand the history of the Fed. “I don’t think any of us who have ever worked at the Fed take any comfort from the fact that somebody screwed up,” says Peter Fisher, former Executive V.P of the New York Fed from 1994-2001. "But it’s important we recognize there were some big mistakes made." And according to Bruce, with QE the central bank today seems to have learned little from a century's worth of examples of the long-term woes resultant from accommodative monetary policy. Money For Nothing hits theaters in New York and DC on Friday, and you can view other release dates here. Watch the trailer: 
stuartpilbrow / FlickrBig changes are coming to the Dow Jones Industrial Average. According to CNBC, Alcoa, Bank of America, and Hewlett-Packard are being dropped from the 30-stock index. They'll be replaced by Goldman Sachs, Nike, and Visa Already, market-watchers are pointing out how future moves in certain industries will have distorted effect on the price-weighted index. Let's run through a quick example. Take the banking sector: Goldman Sachs is currently priced at $159.49 per share. Bank of America is priced at $14.48. Because the index is price weighted, a 1% move in the banking sector (assuming Goldman and BofA move hand-in-hand) will have a much larger impact on how the Dow moves. Currently, a 1 point move in a Dow stock translates to a 7.68 point move in the Dow as a whole (this calculation is likely to be tweaked.) A 1% move in Bank of America ($0.14) would add 1.1 point to the Dow. A 1% move in Goldman Sachs ($1.59) would add 12.2 points to the Dow. Right away you can see why people have gripes about the index, which is supposed to be representative of the U.S. economy. According to CNBC, the changes become effective on September 23.
MSNBCMayoral candidate Anthony Weiner had his last television appearance before New York City's primary day Tuesday night with MSNBC's Lawrence O'Donnell — and it was a train wreck to behold. Weiner's appearance on "The Last Word" ended a marathon day in which he appeared on the "Today" show and various MSNBC programs, along with a heavy dose of campaigning.  But O'Donnell immediately aired his grievances with Weiner. He opened the interview by asking, simply, "What is wrong with you?" "I don't understand the question," Weiner said. "What is wrong with me that I care so much about the issues that I fight for every day of my entire career?" No. "What I mean is, what is wrong with you that you can't imagine a life without elected office?" O'Donnell said. "That's ridiculous," Weiner said.  O'Donnell went on about how he didn't understand what he saw as a "desperate need" for Weiner to hold elected office, and to use elected office for personal redemption.  "Lawrence, just do me a favor," Weiner said, after several minutes of back-and-forth bickering. "I just need, like, a hand signal when the haranguing is done." As time was running out on the show, and on the interview, O'Donnell asked Weiner if he would stay to continue the conversation in video that would be posted online. "Online?! Get harangued online?! No one watches the show! Who do you think's going to watch online?!" Weiner said. Here's the clip:  Visit NBCNews.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy   Seems he is moving forward on Primary Day with just a walk in the neighborhood, as photographed by Business Insider photographer Daniel Goodman outside our offices.  #anthonyweiner just doing his thing on #NYCPrimary #nyc #NYC2013 #nycmayoralrace pic.twitter.com/NaWa6C2rIG
Via CNBC's Carl Quinatinilla there's a shakeup at the Dow Jones Industrial average Breaking: Goldman Sachs, Nike, Visa to be added to Dow Jones Industrials. $GS $NKE $V Alcoa, Bank of America, Hewlett-Packard to be removed from Dow Jones. $AA $BAC $HPQ All these moves make sense. BofA and HP are fallen stars, and Alcoa is increasingly an irrelevancy. Meanwhile, Nike is one of the most amazingly durable brands in the world. Visa and Goldman are two of the pillars of the modern financial system.
Syria has "agreed to the Russian initiative" to place the country's chemical weapons under international control for subsequent dismantling, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem said on Tuesday. He added that Syria did so to "uproot U.S. aggression." On Wednesday U.S. President Barack Obama said that he would "absolutely" pause plans for strikes on Syria if Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was serious about ceding control of the WMD stockpiles. Moscow and Damascus "expect to present this plan soon" to the U.N., Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told Agence-France Presse on Tuesday.  China and Iran, who along with Russia is propping up the Syrian regime, back the Kremlin's proposal. How Syria would place one of the world’s largest stockpiles of chemical weapons under international control in the middle of an ongoing civil war is unclear. The Syrian opposition denounced the notion as a political maneuver "that will only result in more deaths and destruction for the Syrian people" and called for military retaliation on Assad's regime for a August 21 chemical weapons attack. Germany, the U.K., and France acknowledged the potential deal but remain skeptical. On Tuesday France said it would propose a United Nations Security Council resolution that will call for Syria to allow inspectors to oversee the destruction of chemical weapons in the country and for Syria to become a member of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. What the Russian move will certainly do is delay any U.S. decision on a strike. "I don't anticipate that you would see a succession of votes this week or anytime in the immediate future," Obama told ABC news. The potential breakthrough arose from an offhand remark by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry that the Kremlin pounced on. Last night Obama said that he had discussed the topic with Russian President Vladimir Putin last week at the G-20 summit.
A Russian proposal to get Syria to cede control of its chemical weapons is about to be enshrined in a French-sponsored U.N. resolution, and oil prices are falling fast on the news. Brent was off -1.27%, while NYMEX-traded WTI was down -1.59%. Here's the Brent chart: Investing.com
David Shankbone / WikipediaLast summer former Chairman and CEO of Citigroup Sandy Weill shocked the world when he advocated breaking up Wall Street banks. He is, after all, the godfather of the "supermarket" one-stop-shop JP Morgan style bank model, and one of the people that pushed to get rid of Glass-Steagall. In other words, he knows what he's talking about here. This morning Weill says he didn't get much of a pushback from bankers for his comments for two reasons — firstly because bankers have felt rage from the rest of the country, and secondly because regulation still hasn't been put in place. "Nobody knows what the rules of the road are going to be," he said, adding that everyone likes to know where they're going and the regulations we are trying to put in place don't clarify that. So does Weill still think banks should be broken up, asked Becky Quick. "If the way the regulations come down do not allow entrepreneurship... do not allow people in the financial industry to make mistakes... because of risking taxpayer money I think that's going to make our financial institutions completely ineffective," Weill responded. Now, exactly how Weill wants to fix these problems seems murky. He told the Squawk crew he doesn't like Dodd-Frank (lots of pages, very small print) and he wants U.S. banks to stay competitive. A Weill regulation would focus more on leverage ratios, leveraged assets, and capital requirements. Weill also added that we don't actually need to bring back Glass-Steagall if we have the right regulation for big banks. Is that a walk-back? Maybe a tiny step.

Fresh data out out last night exceeded expectations (in terms of power generation, industrial production, and retail sales). Via Jefferies, this chart of Chinese electric power generation shows how big 2013 is compared to previous years, but also how impressive the recent rise is, given that in past years, August saw a seasonal decline.

REUTERS/Michaela RehleGood morning. Here's what you need to know:
Almost two years ago I posted a graph with projections of when payroll employment would return to pre-recession levels (see: Sluggish Growth and Payroll Employment from November 2011). In 2011, I argued we'd continue to see sluggish growth (back in 2011 many analysts were forecasting another US recession - those forecasts were wrong).   On the graph I posted two lines - one with payroll growth of 125,000 payroll jobs added per month (the pace in 2011), and another line with 200,000 payroll jobs per month.  The following graph is an update with reported payroll growth through August 2013.The dashed red line is 125,000 payroll jobs added per month. The dashed blue line is 200,000 payroll jobs per month.  Both projections are from November 2011. Click on graph for larger image.CalculatedRiskSo far the economy has tracked just below the blue line (200,000 payroll jobs per month). Right now it appears payrolls will exceed the pre-recession peak in mid-2014. Currently there are about 1.9 million fewer payroll jobs than before the recession started, and at the recent pace of job growth it will take just under 11 months to reach the previous peak.   Note: I expect another upward adjustment when the annual benchmark revision is released in January, so we will probably reach the previous peak in fewer than 11 months. Of course this doesn't include population growth and new entrants into the workforce (the workforce has continued to grow). Note: There are 1.366 million fewer privatesector payroll jobs than before the recession started. At the recent pace of private sector job growth - plus a positive benchmark revision in January - the private sector could be back at the pre-recession peak in early 2014.
Via Markit, here's a chart of the year-over-year change in Spanish house prices going back over 10 years. What's striking is how relentless the declines are years after the bubble started bursting, Spain is still looking at prices that are down 10% from the year before. The good news, we suppose, is that last year prices were falling at a 15% annual rate. So, green shoots! Markit
REUTERS/Rupak de ChowdhuriYou've heard a lot over the past few months about the emerging market carnage. Well, it's time to buy, argues Morgan Stanley: We move to ACCUMULATE (from HOLD) our tactical marketdirectional stance for EM currencies and rates. We maintain our HOLD in EM credit, owing to supply-related concerns. ... For EM broadly, we see scope for stability and market recovery over 4Q13, on the back of (1) improved valuations; (2) what we expect to be a period of improvement in the data; and (3) better overall technicals for local markets. The re-pricing of markets since May has been dramatic, with real trade-weighted exchange rates having depreciated to near all-time lows and embedded risk premia in local curves reaching multi-year highs. Our models imply the liquid EM rates curves are pricing in a US 10y note yield north of 3.1%. This is broadly consistent with our Interest Rate Strategy team’s baseline forecast going in to 3Q14.
Robert Kessler of Kessler Investment Advisors was on WealthTrack this last weekend defending bonds.  He takes the contrarian view that the bond bull isn’t over yet.  His defense: Kessler says the 10 year Treasury bond should yield about 1% above the rate of inflation and that means the risks to yields at present are to the downside.  See the full interview here: 
REUTERS/Remo Casilli Obsessing over sovereign borrowing costs in the Eurozone is a very 2012 thing to do, but it has been observed that for the first time in awhile, Italy is paying more to borrow money than Spain is. Spain is generally seen as the weaker of the two economies (much worse unemployment, a higher deficit, a much more fragile banking system, etc.) so this is surprising. Except the crux of the story is that Silvio Berlusconi continues to threaten to topple the Italian government, which is based on a fragile coalition of the major parties. Berlusconi's threat is that if he's expelled from the Senate â€” over criminal convictions â€” then his party would withdraw support for the current Letta government, and that would require new elections, and new chaos. Hence the switch. Discussion on Berlusconi's fate is happening this week.
Reuters/David GrayThe big story in economic news overnight is that China came out with a fresh round of data that handily beat expectations. This is part of a longer pattern over the past couple months where Chinese data hasn't been that bad. This is funny for two reasons: Not only is the hard landing not materializing, China is the best of the bunch. Ironic. Meanwhile, here's BofAML on the strong data from China and what it means for growth targets: With today’s higher-than-expected IP growth reading, we see clear upside risk to our 7.6% yoy growth forecast for 3Q13 and 7.6% annual GDP growth forecast for 2013.  As we expected, Street economists have already revised up their growth forecasts in the past month, but we now expect another round of upward growth revisions on the Street in the next couple of weeks. On quarterly growth patterns, we expect an impressive recovery in 3Q13 (our official forecast at 7.6%, but we see upside risk) from 7.5% yoy in 2Q13, a bit moderation in 4Q13 due to slowdown in restocking and base effect, a rebound again in 1H13 on a low base, and slowdown again 2H on falling trend growth and base effect.
REUTERS/Gerardo GarciaMarkets are off to a great start this week. Yesterday they were buoyed, perhaps, by the perception that a strike in Syria is looking even less unlikely than it did before. Not only is Obama way behind in theoretical Congressional voting, there may even be some diplomatic stick save, thanks to a Kerry gaffe about how Assad can avoid strikes by handing over control of his chemical weapons arsenal. We'll see. This lead to big gains yesterday. And Asian markets carried the baton in Tuesday trading, with Japan up 1.5%, India up 2.7%, and Shanghai gaining 1.1%. Helping matters: A fresh batch of Chinese economic data that beat expectations, confirming that the hard landing is not on right now.
REUTERS/Kim Kyung-HoonBEIJING (Reuters) - China's annual industrial output rose 10.4 percent in August, beating market expectations, while retail sales rose 13.4 percent, official data showed on Tuesday.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast industrial output to rise 9.9 percent and retail sales to rise 13.2 percent. Fixed-asset investment for the January-August period was seen up 20.2 percent.
