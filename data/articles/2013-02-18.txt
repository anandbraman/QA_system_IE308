padmanaba01 / FlickrWe've been writing so much about Japan, and the decline of the yen and so forth that you might be mistaken if you thought that the great "Japan trade" that hedge funds have been waiting around for years to play has become reality. The answer is: Not really. As Richard Barley at WSJ's Heart On The Street notes, the real "widowmaker" is shorting Japanese Government Bonds. That's the big kahuna trade that folks for years have been expecting will one day create some trader untold fortunes. You know the theory: Japanese government debt is over 200% of GDP, and one way those bonds will explode in the Keynesian endgame. Sure, some traders have made a lot of money on the decline in the yen, but the Nikkei has been on a tear, and this isn't actually the hallmark of an economy going into a watershed collapse. And in the meantime, Japanese bond yields have been pretty flat. So remember, for all the talk about the big turn in Japan, the core idea that people have had for a long time still hasn't come to fruition.
Listen to Mario Draghi, the head of the ECB, when he talks about the so-called "Currency Wars" AKA, the idea that countries are engaging in competitive currency devaluations for the purpose of boosting their exports. From Reuters, here are some comments Draghi gave to the European parliament, in Brussels. "Most of the exchange rate movements that we have seen were not explicitly targeted, they were the result of domestic macro economic policies meant to boost the economy," Draghi said. "In this sense, I find really excessive any language referring to currency wars," he said, adding that the euro's exchange rate was "around its long-term average." The rapid decline of the yen is what's got everyone talking about "currency wars" since Japan has historically been a big export nation, and yes, the country's exporters are likely to benefit from a weakening currency. But the mistake is thinking that Japan is directly acting to weaken its currency, rather than taking a fairly standard approach to monetary policy, which has the effect of weakening its currency. This chart is a little out of date (its from World Bank data) but real interest rates in Japan have been much higher than those in the US, which has made the yen so strong in recent years.  Japan Real Interest Rate data by YCharts What Japan is now doing, rationally, is trying to lower real interest rates for the purpose of stimulating an economy that's been saddled with weak growth and deflation. It's standard stuff. But lowering real interest rates does have the effect of weakening the currency. So yes, the yen is declining due to policy, but it's all stuff that's nicely within the realm of monetary policy, which Mario Draghi clearly grasps.
U.S. DOLLAR gold bullion prices failed to hold onto gains made in Monday's Asian session, falling to $1611 an ounce by lunchtime in London, just a few Dollars above Friday's six-month low, as the US Dollar extended recent gains. Gold dropped 3.4% over the course of last week, including a sharp drop during Friday's US trading. "The latest price slide was accompanied by significant outflows from gold ETFs," says today's commodities note from Commerzbank. "Investors on the futures market are [also] largely to blame [for the price drop]." The speculative net long position of gold futures and options traders on the Comex fell to its lowest reported level since August in the week ended last Tuesday, weekly data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission show. The spec net long is calculated as the difference between 'bullish' long and 'bearish' short contracts held by Comex traders categorized as 'noncommercial'. "Clearly, the market, which has been plagued by concerns over central banks' commitments to continued monetary accommodation, was concerned about the downside that would be opened up in the absence of Asian players that were celebrating Lunar New Year last week," says Marc Ground, commodities strategist at Standard Bank. Trading volumes set a new record on the Shanghai Gold Exchange Monday, according to newswire Reuters, with more than 22 tonnes of the Au9999 contract (for bars of 99.99% purity) traded, as China's markets re-opened following last week's Lunar New Year holiday. Silver meantime rallied back above $30 an ounce during Monday's Asian session, trading either side of that level during the morning in London. European stock markets were little changed on the day by lunchtime, with volumes reported lower with US markets closed today for Presidents' Day. Commodities were also broadly flat, with the exception of copper which was down more than 1.2% on the day by lunchtime in London. On the currency markets, the US Dollar Index, which measures that currency's strength against a basket of other currencies, touched its highest level so far this year this morning. Following a two-day meeting in Moscow, G20 finance ministers issued a joint communiqué over the weekend saying they will "refrain from competitive devaluation" of their currencies. "We will not target our exchange rates for competitive purposes," the statement added. "[The communiqué will] limit Japan's ability to provide verbal guidance on the Yen moving forward," reckons Adarsh Sinha, foreign exchange strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. "This likely takes away a key tool used by Japanese officials to weaken the yen at an unprecedented pace and shifts the burden of evidence to policy implementation." The Yen however fell further against the Dollar this morning, extending Friday's drop and erasing most of the gains made last week ahead of the G20 meeting. Following the onset of the financial crisis in 2007, the Yen rose by more than a third against the Dollar by mid-2011, though it has since weakened by more than 20%. Elsewhere on the currency markets, Sterling fell to a seven-month low against the Dollar this morning, also edging lower against the Euro. More money managers are shorting Sterling than buying it for the first time in five months, the Financial Times reports, citing the latest CFTC data. "The Pound seems clearly at risk of following the Yen and suffering the next large-scale devaluation for a major currency," reckons Mansoor Mohi-Uddin, head of global currency strategy at UBS. "It is possible that the full benefits of [Sterling's] 2007/8 depreciation are yet to be realized," said Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee member Martin Weale in a speech on Saturday, adding that "growth of exports and a shrinkage of imports would together be a helpful source of demand for UK output". The Royal Mint plans to make its first gold coins in India since 1918, in partnership with refiner MMTC-PAMP, with a view to marketing the coins in the world's largest gold buying market, the Mint announced Monday. The announcement comes as British prime minister David Cameron starts a three-day visit to India, where he is due to meet business representatives.
AP The two most hated currencies in the world right now are: The Japanese Yen and The British Pound. In the case of the yen, the new Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has come into power with an aggressive easing agenda (both monetary and fiscal). The yen has been getting slaughtered since November. In the case of the British pound (which has been getting hammered all year) the currency is weakening on a combination of weak economic prospects, a worsening balance of trade, and the expectation that newly incoming Bank of England chief Mark Carney will be inclined to ease policy further. And George Soros is apparently going after both currencies. The FT's Sam Jones reports: Ask some of the worldâ€™s biggest hedge funds where they are watching for the next big shift in global markets and many will point to the same place: sterling.Â  Having made billions successfully shorting the yen since November, top global macro traders â€“ funds such as Soros Fund Management, Tudor Investment Corporation, Caxton Associates and Moore Capital â€“ are increasingly looking at the pound. It's unclear what "increasingly looking" at means, in terms of where they are in the trade process. But yes, as noted above, Soros is also making a fortune on the declining yen, with his firm having tallied $1 billion in profits on the declining currency, according to reports. As an aside, there's a piece up at The Guardian about the Pound losing its safe-haven status. But this isn't entirely accurate. A decline in a currency, even a sharp one, doesn't say anything about its role as a safe haven or not. All around the world, a lot of crisis trades are being unwound (safe havens everywhere are falling) and so a drop in the Pound is entirely consistent with being a safe haven. Furthermore, the drop in the pound is a natural response to both economics and policy, not about some loss of confidence in the durability of the currency itself. One last point, Soros shorting the pound of course has symbolic interest, because he famously "broke" the Bank of England" by shorting the pound in 1992, when it was pegged to an unsustainable fixed exchanged rate. This is nothing like that. The BoE isn't trying to defend the pound in any sense at this point, and a decline in the currency is not a problem.
Last May, investor Mark Dow wrote a fantastic post on his blog titled: Reagan's Gone. You're Old. Get Over it. The gist was this: The Reagan economic playbook didn't make sense in post-crisis America, and economic commentators needed to recognize that. Reagan's economic task was characterized by a need to fight inflation, address historically high taxes, and undo onerous regulation, all the while benefiting from a nice demographic tailwind. The post-2008 period is nothing like that. Wrote Mark Dow: Fast-forward to post-2008. Whatever the opposite of pent-up demand is, thatâ€™s what we have. Inflation and interest rates are already low, household leverage is a major burden, consumption was pulled forward during the boom, and demography is no longer our friend. Plus, we have globalization acting like a supply shock to our labor pool, holding down wages. In short, the tailwinds are now headwinds. On the government side, unions are far less powerful today, there are no price and wage controls, and tax rates are low. It seems next to impossible to make the case that supply-side policies can have anywhere near the effect today that they had in the 80s. Yet, so many still do. Much of our body politic is stuckâ€”along with the bulk of the baby boomersâ€”in the 1980s, still trying to relive those old battles in the rear-view mirror. The US has changed. The world has changed. The problems have changed. The emerging world is rapidly plugging into the grid, hungrier and willing to work for less. We need to be pragmatic. Adjust and compete. Look around the globe without preconceived notions and see what we can learn from others. Being stuck in the same old big government/small government debate keeps us from doing this. Sometimes supply-side policies are right and sometimes theyâ€™re not. Sometimes Keynesian polices are right, sometimes theyâ€™re not. Until we approach policies as tools in a toolkit and not as divine scriptures, we are going to be stuck in an ideological logjam, wasting precious time. Time to get off the ideological paradigm. Of course, back then this message didn't go very far. But now ... it seems to be gaining some traction. In a great NYT column, Ramesh Ponnuru (a National Review writer, and a conservative in good standing) makes the same basic argument as Dow did. Times have changed. The challenges are different. Repeating the early '80s playbook doesn't make any sense today. When Reagan cut rates for everyone, the top tax rate was 70 percent and the income tax was the biggest tax most people paid. Now neither of those things is true: For most of the last decade the top rate has been 35 percent, and the payroll tax is larger than the income tax for most people. Yet Republicans have treated the income tax as the same impediment to economic growth and middle-class millstone that it was in Reaganâ€™s day. House Republicans have repeatedly voted to bring the top rate down still further, to 25 percent. A Republican Party attentive to todayâ€™s problems rather than yesterdayâ€™s would work to lighten the burden of the payroll tax, not just the income tax. An expanded child tax credit that offset the burden of both taxes would be the kind of broad-based middle-class tax relief that Reagan delivered. Republicans should make room for this idea in their budgets, even if it means giving up on the idea of a 25 percent top tax rate. Ponnuru goes on to make the same point regarding monetary policy. Whereas inflation was the big enemy in the early '80s, that is not the case now. Since the 2012 election, the GOP has been searching for a solution to the party's woes (E.g. will salvation be found in immigration?). There are probably a few areas that need help, but the party's economic dogma is disastrous. The obsession with tight monetary policy, austerity, and inflexibility on top tax rates is totally out of step with the moment, and what the economy needs to heal. This advice from Ponnuru â€” who is nobody's idea of a RINO â€” is a great sign.
It's about the time when people on Wall Street take a look back at last year, and it's looking ugly. According to a survey by eFinancial careers, Wall Street bonuses fell by over a third last year, diving 36%. The front office felt it the most (they, after all, have the most to lose) seeing bonuses fall 38%. Not only were bonuses lower last year, but also more bankers had their bonuses clawed-back or deferred than in 2011. For example, 19% of respondents to this survey had their bonuses deferred Â in 2011 as opposed to 23% in 2012. Bottom line, this is a "pay-for-performance" environment. Increasingly, banks care about how well individuals do. If your bank does well, great, but it doesn't mean you'll be seeing more cash.Â  Another thing to consider here is what this does for Wall Street recruiting. Four years after the financial crisis the pain hasn't stopped. In fact, it will likely be this bad, if not worse, for a bit. That means you people that looked to finance as a career option before are going to look elsewhere.
In case you missed it, quiet financial newspaper Barron's took a huge swipe at Obama in its latest cover, promising that if he got his way, the US would be on the road to Greece. Twitter Let's skip the actual contents of the argument for a moment. For example, let's skip the arbitrariness of the "25 years" warning, and the fact that the US monetary system is nothing like Greece's. And let's ignore the fact that the sequester (which is what Barron's is advocating as the "responsible course") does nothing to alter the long-term fiscal trajectory of the country. Of course it's all silliness. But the real point here is that Barron's isn't so much a newspaper, but rather a mass-market stock tips newsletter -- note the columns on the left about Rochester Medical and Linn Energy. And there's a very wide overlap between investment newsletter services, and cranky, anti-debt, armageddonism. It's part of the pitch. If you've ever read a copy of Jim Grant's "Interest Rate Observer" or Marc Faber's "Boom, Doom, Gloom Report" you'll find it's basically divided into two parts: First you get the author giving their big pronouncement on the world (E.G., Bernanke is ruining the dollar! All of this debt can only lead to WWIII!). Then after that, you get your stock and bond and commodity tips, usually free from politics or philosophy. People always want to be told a story. And the doom story tends to have appeal among the older, conservative readers of these publications. Barron's has always been a conservative publication, but a cover like this is just a natural move for a stock tips newsletter.

China's Shanghai Composite traded for the first time in a week, but they closed down 0.4 percent.  Lunar New Year holiday sales reportedly came in a bit light.
The meetings were often raucous and wrathful and almost all the time the pro forces won — for the excellent reason that they were funded and organized by the chain stores themselves (in an early demonstration of the new axioms that money-is-speech and corporations are people, too!).  The chain stores won not only because they flung money around — sometimes directly into the wallets of public officials — but because a sizeable chunk of every local population longed for the dazzling new mode of commerce. "We Want Bargain Shopping" was their rallying cry.  The unintended consequence of their victories through the 1970s and beyond was the total destruction of local economic networks, that is, Main Streets and downtowns, in effect destroying many of their own livelihoods. Wasn't that a bargain, though?      Despite the obvious damage now visible in the entropic desolation of every American home town, WalMart managed to install itself in the pantheon of American Dream icons, along with apple pie, motherhood, and Coca Cola. In most of the country there is no other place to buy goods (and no other place to get a paycheck, scant and demeaning as it may be). America made itself hostage to bargain shopping and then committed suicide. Here we find another axiom of human affairs at work: People get what they deserve, not what they expect. Life is tragic.     The older generations responsible for all that may be done for, but the momentum has now turned in the opposite direction. Though the public hasn't groked it yet, WalMart and its kindred malignant organisms have entered their own yeast-overgrowth death spiral. In a now permanently contracting economy the big box model fails spectacularly. Every element of economic reality is now poised to squash them.  Diesel fuel prices are heading well north of $4 again. If they push toward $5 this year you can say goodbye to the "warehouse on wheels" distribution method. (The truckers, who are mostly independent contractors, can say hello to the re-po men come to take possession of their mortgaged rigs.)  Global currency wars (competitive devaluations) are about to destroy trade relationships. Say goodbye to the 12,000 mile supply chain from Guangzhou to Hackensack. Say goodbye to the growth financing model in which it becomes necessary to open dozens of new stores every year to keep the credit revolving.      Then there is the matter of the American customers themselves. The WalMart shoppers are exactly the demographic that is getting squashed in the contraction of this phony-baloney corporate buccaneer parasite revolving credit crony capital economy. Unlike the Federal Reserve, WalMart shoppers can't print their own money, and they can't bundle their MasterCard and Visa debts into CDOs to be fobbed off on Scandinavian pension funds for quick profits.  They have only one real choice: buy less stuff, especially the stuff of leisure, comfort, and convenience.     The potential for all sorts of economic hardship is obvious in this burgeoning dynamic. But the coming implosion of big box retail implies tremendous opportunities for young people to make a livelihood in the imperative rebuilding of local economies.  At this stage it is probably discouraging for them, because all their life programming has conditioned them to be hostages of giant corporations and so to feel helpless. In a town like the old factory village I live in (population 2500) few of the few remaining young adults might venture to open a retail operation in one of the dozen-odd vacant storefronts on Main Street.  The presence of K-Mart, Tractor Supply, and Radio Shack a quarter mile west in the strip mall would seem to mock their dim inklings that something is in the wind. But K-Mart will close over 200 boxes this year, and Radio Shack is committed to shutter around 500 stores. They could be gone in this town well before Santa Claus starts checking his lists. If they go down, opportunities will blossom. There will be no new chain store brands to replace the dying ones. That phase of our history is over.     What we're on the brink of is scale implosion. Everything gigantic in American life is about to get smaller or die. Everything that we do to support economic activities at gigantic scale is going to hamper our journey into the new reality. The campaign to sustain the unsustainable, which is the official policy of US leadership, will only produce deeper whirls of entropy.  I hope young people recognize this and can marshal their enthusiasm to get to work. It's already happening in the local farming scene; now it needs to happen in a commercial economy that will support local agriculture.     The additional tragedy of the big box saga is that it scuttled social roles and social relations in every American community. On top of the insult of destroying the geographic places we call home, the chain stores also destroyed people's place in the order of daily life, including the duties, responsibilities, obligations, and ceremonies that prompt citizens to care for each other.  We can get that all back, but it won't be a bargain.  ____________________________________For a complete list of books by James Howard Kunstler and purchase links, CLICK HERE.          Read more posts on Kunstler.com »
SHALE exploitation in North Dakota has lifted incomes and brought unemployment down to 3.2% of the workforce, the lowest level in the country. Californians are rarely found looking longingly towards the Midwest. But the revelation that their state, with unemployment at 9.8% and America’s highest poverty rate, may be sitting on the largest deposit of shale oil in the continental United States has led some to wonder if their salvation lies 10,000 feet (3,000 metres) beneath them. California has been an oil state since 1865. Thanks largely to reserves that can still be tapped by conventional means, it remains the third-largest producer in the country. Output has lately been declining by 2-3% a year, according to the state’s Energy Commission. But in 2011 the federal Energy Information Administration declared that the Monterey shale formation, which spans 1,750 square miles (450,000 hectares) in southern and central California, held 15.42 billion barrels of recoverable oil, 64% of the total estimated to be in the 48 contiguous states. That should be an attractive prospect for a state with a history of unemployment and fiscal woe. But environmental scruples have long been as characteristic of California as budgetary mismanagement, and a battle is brewing. Opponents of the hydraulic fracturing ("fracking") technique often used to extract oil and gas from shale rock in "unconventional" drilling say regulations proposed by the state in December do not adequately protect against groundwater contamination or air pollution. Some mutter about earthquakes. Such concerns find receptive ears in a seismically active state with a large farm sector. The oilmen reply that fracking has been conducted in California for years without trouble. Moreover, they add, surely the environmentally concerned should want as much Californian oil as possible produced under the state’s tight regulations, rather than imported from places with looser regimes. Some see an emerging split between inland counties, which tend to have higher unemployment and more conservative politics, and the conservationists along the coast. The row will rumble on, with revised rules expected later this year. For some, the complex geology of the Monterey shale opens up alternative means of extraction. Santa Maria Energy, a small producer in Santa Barbara County, about 150 miles (240 km) north-west of Los Angeles, extracts 200 barrels of crude a day from the shale at depths of around 2,500 feet by exploiting natural fractures in the rock. Although the firm has no plans to begin fracking, David Pratt, its president, likes to say that the Monterey is California’s way out of the "fiscal toilet". Some of the "Saudi America" talk is overdone. And even if California does begin exploiting the Monterey aggressively, an economic miracle is unlikely. California’s population is over 50 times bigger than North Dakota’s, and, as Kevin Klowden of the Milken Institute, a think-tank, points out, the opportunity costs of giving over land to drilling may be far higher in California than in some other states. No producer has yet found a way to begin large-scale extraction from the Monterey. But despite the geological and regulatory uncertainties, several firms have placed large bets on its future. And other states in the region sitting on shale reserves are forging merrily ahead. At a Senate hearing on February 12th John Hickenlooper, Colorado’s Democratic governor, staked out his position by announcing that he had once drunk a glass of fracking fluid. Meanwhile, the technology that kick-started the revolution marches on. Some speak excitedly of fracking that uses saline rather than fresh water, or no water at all. The industry has moved so quickly in recent years, says Dan Kirschner of the Northwest Gas Association, a trade body, that it is starting to seem odd to call shale resources "unconventional".

As gasoline prices rise above $5/gallon in LA (see video below), analysts are puzzled. Gasoline prices have been on the rise for the past 31 days, which is highly unusual for this time of the year. Typically prices begin rising in March or April as the driving season kicks off.  Â  Â  The price increases are particularly puzzling, given the fact that US gasoline markets have been well supplied relative to historical levels. EIA via Soberlook Certainly the recent increases in crude oil prices have been a large part of the explanation. Some have suggested that increased demand due to stronger global economic activity is to blame. Other reasons have been proposed as well. CNN: - What's behind the higher prices at the pump? It's a confluence of factors, from rising crude oil prices, to production cuts and refinery closings. "Right now, things are tight worldwide," said Ray Carbone, president of New York commodities trading firm Paramount Options. "Refineries going down, unanticipated maintenance, and higher demand ... going into driving season. Gasoline futures trading on NYMEX (CME) have been rising almost daily, pointing to even higher prices at the pump in the spring. Sober Look This is clearly going to create headwinds for consumer sentiment and ultimately spending patterns, particularly when combined with other issues consumers are facing this year. CNN: - It's hitting wallets right in the middle of winter, when people are already looking at large home heating bills. And it comes just after many Americans have been hit with smaller paychecks, and are worried about looming budget cutsÂ that could deliver an even deeper blow. Â 
President Obama's heartfelt State of the Union plea for stronger gun safety laws was still fresh in mind when I received these pictures from a reader. The photos show an arsenal of weapons the reader just legally bought including a Russian made Saiga-12 shotgun, an AR-15 assault rifle, a huge cache of ammo, and several accessories. The reader bought the shotgun at a gun show where there was no wait or background check. He left with the Saiga, a 30-round drum, a 10-round magazine, and an additional 5-round magazine. On top of that he added night vision, three laser sights, and a tactical light. "Please come to my house and take my guns!!!" he taunted the government, when he gleefully sent us the string of pictures below. The Saiga is manufactured by the Russian company Izhmash that builds rocket launchers, AK-47s, and all manner of military-grade weaponry. In addition the the Saiga, and the .45 caliber and 10mm handguns this reader owns, he's also waiting on an AR-15, which he ordered online. The AR of course is the assault weapon used in the Colorado theater shooting. Including the custom modifications, the AR-15 will arrive at his door (dealer's door...) about three weeks after ordering. With that rifle he ordered a 100-round drum, three 30-round magazines, and a 10-round drum as well as a tactical night scope that's better than most anything given to U.S. military members. The rifles are harder to get after recent shootings. "I paid triple for a gun that was $900 a few months ago," he told me. Asked about the shortage and high cost of ammunition, and he said buyers just needed to know when sellers' shipments arrive. "Because they're gone the following day," he said. Among the reader's most recent online ammo orders were 2,500 rounds for the Saiga, 500 rounds each for the .45 and the 10mm, along with 1,000 7.62X39mm rounds for the AR-15. There are background checks for online gun sales, and by all licensed dealers at gun shows. But not all sellers are licensed. Not that a standard background check would have prevented any of these purchases. Our reader, for example, passed his with flying colors. And the reader has been in plenty of legal trouble. In addition to a restraining order, and time in jail for violating it, the reader was tried for conspiracy to commit murder against his wife.   "You can get in all sorts of trouble, but as long as you get out of it you can buy whatever you want," he said Monday morning during a phone call. After his acquittal on the conspiracy to commit murder charge, the reader applied for and received a concealed weapon permit as well. Here are some pictures of the reader's new arsenal: Robert Johnson — Business InsiderThe Saiga-12 shotgun bought here at a gun show makes the AR-15 assault rifle look like a toy Robert Johnson — Business InsiderThere are three lasers and a tactical light mounted to the top for accuracy under all types of conditions Robert Johnson — Business InsiderThis is how the Saiga-12 was displayed to attract buyers that could swing the $3,700 price tagRobert Johnson — Business InsiderThat's the large magazine with the front handle folded up and the tactical light mounted on the sideRobert Johnson — Business InsiderThe 30-round drum is just one option for loading the large 12-gauge shells that can hold either a single slug or various sized metal balls
Proof there is no rebalancing in Europe is easy to find. For example, El Pais reports Spanish Debt Grows by €146 Billion. What follows is a Mish-modified translation of the above Google-translation. Key Points The Government and the Bank of Spain debt figures are chilling. Government debt broke records in 2012. In the first year of the Government of Mariano Rajoy, debt skyrocketed to €882 billion, a one year increased of €146 Billion. Never in the economic history of Spain's general government debt had increased so much in a single year. In five years, the debt has increased by €500 Billion, Debt is one of the major drags on the recovery of the Spanish economy.Debt to GDPMish Shedlock The increase in public debt in 2012 is the equivalent of more than 14 percentage points of gross domestic product (GDP). €882 billion is equivalent to between 83.5% and 84% of GDP. The government had forecast a ratio of 79.8% for the 2012 budget last July, but has since revised the figure upwards. In relative terms, debt-to-GDP is at highest debt level in more than a century, particularly since 1910, when the Spanish debt stood at 88% of GDP, according to a historical IMF data. Despite cuts and tax increases, the government of Mariano Rajoy has been unable to significantly reduce the gap in the public accounts.Skyrocketing Public DebtMish Shedlockclick on chart for sharper image Outstanding liabilities will probably exceed 100% of GDP at the end of the year, and there are more than €100 billion of a government debt in the hands of others (Social Security mainly). The €882 billion figure also does not include about €60 billion of debt owed by public enterprises. A Troubling Context  To Emilio Ontiveros, president of Financial Analysts International (AFI), "the main problem is the payment of interest, because it is the most unproductive spending item possible and occurs in a country that has had to cut back in other areas and need to recover growth." Spain had never spent so much money to pay only the interest on its debt: €38.66 billion. Financial expenses for the first time in history exceeded staff costs. "If you do not grow, you cannot pay your debts," said Ontiveros, who argues that Spain should have requested the bond purchase program prepared by the Bank Central Bank (ECB) to cut interest paid on Spanish debt markets, a mechanism for which the Government should ask before rescue its European partners. "The corollary of this is that Spain needs urgent measures aimed to reduce this expense," he says. The average interest paid by the state's debt is 4.1% with an average maturity of 6.1 years, but this level of return that investors demand may grow by the economic downturn. Despite the truce that markets have given Spain, political tensions rose in Spain and Italy . Jose Carlos Diez, chief economist Intermoney, warns that Spain fails in all the variables that serve to stabilize the debt: its economy does not grow, it pays a high interest rate and has primary deficit (prior to payment of interest on the debt). "This dynamic eventually leads to non-payment," he reflects.End-Transalation ote that last comment by Jose Carlos Diez, chief economist Intermoney "This dynamic eventually leads to non-payment." Indeed!More on Non-Rebalancing Many economists see signs of stabilization. I see signs of delusion in economists.  Mike "Mish" Shedlockhttp://globaleconomicanalysis.blogspot.com
MAMADOU NDIAYE grew up in Senegal. His parents were "not poor, but not rich". He was fascinated by mathematics, which he studied at Cheikh Anta Diop University in Dakar and then taught for several years in CÃ´te dâ€™Ivoire, saving to pursue his dream of studying in America. He went to New York, where he worked at Staples, an office-supplies chain, to finance his masters in statistics at Columbia University. A customer, impressed by Mr Ndiayeâ€™s sales advice, suggested that the Senegalese apply for a job with his own employer, IBM. That was 15 years ago. Now Mr Ndiaye is back home, as manager of the office Big Blue opened in Dakar last May. The office in Senegal is just one sign that IBM believes Africa will bring in billions. It is no newcomer: it sold its first gear there to South Africaâ€™s railways in 1911 and a mainframe computer to Ghanaâ€™s central statistics bureau in 1964. Lately it has been paying special attention to the continent. In July 2011 it won a ten-year, $1.5 billion contract to provide Bharti Airtel, an Indian mobile-phone company, with information-technology services in 16 African countries. Since mid-2011 it has set up shop in Angola, Mauritius and Tanzania, as well as Senegal. In all, it boasts a presence in more than 20 of Africaâ€™s 54 countries. Last August it opened a research lab in Nairobi, one of only 12 in the world. And between February 5th and 7th Ginni Rometty, its chief executive, and all who report directly to her met dozens of African customers, actual and prospective, in Johannesburg and the Kenyan capital. It was, Mrs Rometty said, the first time the whole top brass had assembled outside New York since she became the boss just over a year ago. Big Blue may be ahead, but it is not alone. Last month Eric Schmidt, Googleâ€™s chairman, spent a week in sub-Saharan cities. He enthused about Nairobi, which, he wrote, "has emerged as a serious tech hub and may become the African leader." Orange, a French mobile operator, and Baidu, Chinaâ€™s answer to Google, recently introduced a jointly branded smartphone browser in Africa and the Middle East. Orange also sponsored this yearâ€™s Africa Cup of Nations, a football tournament, in South Africa. (Nigeria won it, beating Burkina Faso in the final on February 10th.) This month Microsoft, which has offices in 14 African countries, unveiled a smartphone to be sold in several African markets. It is made by Chinaâ€™s Huawei and uses Microsoftâ€™s new operating system. In Kenya Microsoft intends to bring broadband to places that do not yet have electricity, using solar power and "white spaces", or spare broadcast-television frequencies. Within a year, says Fernando de Sousa, the general manager for Microsoft in Africa, 6,000 people in the Rift Valley will have access to broadband. Similar projects are planned elsewhere. Since October Microsoft has been running "app factories" for programmers in Egypt and South Africa. Mark Walker of IDC, a research firm, says that in the past three or four years multinational companies have adopted a "completely fresh approach". They have "a lot more skin in the game: investing in local people, so thereâ€™s proper knowledge transfer, investing in country offices." Companies are in it for the long term now, rather than quitting after a bad quarter or two. Africaâ€™s chief attraction is that it has been growing while richer regions have stalled (see chart 1). Its demographic prospects are promising, too. As America, Europe and China age, Africa can expect a bulge of workers in their productive prime. Though skills are in short supply, they are becoming more abundant. According to the McKinsey Global Institute, the consulting firmâ€™s research unit, in 2002 only 32% of Africans had secondary or tertiary education, but by 2020, 48% will have. The continent can call on degree-laden expatriates such as Mr Ndiaye and Uyi Stewart, the Nigerian chief scientist of IBMâ€™s Nairobi lab. Some countries are better off, more stable or simply keener than others to make the most of IT. Kenya may be keenest. In 2006, frustrated by the slow progress of a regional plan to lay a fibre-optic cable along the east coast of the continent, Kenya negotiated its own link to the United Arab Emirates. The Gulf cable landed in 2009. The regional link, in which Kenya remains a partner, followed the next year. Bitange Ndemo, a bigwig in the Ministry of Information and Communications and the man responsible for the cable from the Gulf, says he wants to see a rise in ITâ€™s share of Kenyan GDP from about 5% now to 35% "within a very short period". He hopes for a mighty shift of employment away from agriculture. "But politicians must have the will," Mr Ndemo says. If they are to create new markets and to profit from them, technology companies have to be on the spot. John Kelly, IBMâ€™s head of research, says that after the firm set up labs in China in 1995 and in India in 1998, "we found that we were getting innovation out of those research labs which could only have occurred in those locations." The Indian lab, for example, produced the "spoken web", for illiterate people with cheap phones. One of the Nairobi labâ€™s early challenges is traffic. The city has few traffic lights or cameras; hence the awful congestion. Signals from motoristsâ€™ mobile phones can help to track traffic, but planners have few data to work with. IBMâ€™s lab will harness other sources, such as security cameras that are not aimed at the road but capture images of it anyway. IBM will then crunch all the data to help planners control traffic and decide where to build more roads. The Nairobi lab is expected to earn its keep quickly. The Chinese and Indian labs, Mr Kelly says, took ten years to make a significant contribution technically and commercially. Kenyaâ€™s target is five. He says the lab has made a good start, drawing on work by an older sibling in Tokyo to tackle its traffic problem. In many sectors, such as health care, education and water, as well as traffic, governments are sure to be important customers for IT companies. But private clients matter too, especially in telecoms and finance. The mobile phone, the first computer many Africans will own (see chart 2), is the bridge between the two. To Westerners, "mobile banking" is a new way of doing something old. To many Africans, it is the obvious way of doing something new. In Kenya M-PESA, a system of transferring money over phones, is an everyday, reliable utility. Equity Bank, a fast-growing bank, most of whose customers have never had an account before, has come of age with mobile technology: its chief executive, James Mwangi, says his customers can use any of its 54 products on the move. For technology companies, all this means a growing demand for many things: reliable connectivity; software; analysis of data on spending, lending and repayment; and data centres. Technology companies say they are keen to serve smaller businesses too. Microsoft has announced a programme called SME4Afrika, which is intended to bring 1m small and medium-sized enterprises online. Mr de Sousa points out that technology can also draw informal businesses into the formal economy. The ability to use software, computing power and storage online "as a service", paying only for what you need and only when you need it, may put the cost of information technology within the budget of many small African businesses. "The person who invented the cloud did it for Africa," says Mr Ndiaye of IBM in Senegal. Mr Kelly makes a bolder claim, linking Africaâ€™s emergence to that of "big data". IBMâ€™s answer to how the world can cope with the rising torrent of exabytes is "cognitive computing". Instead of being given detailed instructions, cognitive computers are fed masses of data and use statistical analysis to answer complex questions. Watson, IBMâ€™s first of this kind, was clever enough to win "Jeopardy", an American television quiz show, beating human champions hollow. The true purpose of a Watson, however, is not to show off on television but to sift data from radio telescopes or provide medical diagnoses. Mr Kelly sees an opportunity "for Africa to move, and move first, to this new era of computing." It can leapfrog straight to the tech frontier, without worrying about adapting old systems to cope with the data it creates. At the Catholic University of Eastern Africa, which will eventually be the new labâ€™s home, a Kenyan asked Mr Kelly, "Will you bring Watson to Africa?" Yes, he replied, if someone suggests a problem for it to solve. Mr Ndemo spoke up: "Let us bring Watson here in nine months." Africa has plenty of problems. Computing power can help Africans solve them. Click here to subscribe to The Economist 
flickr/andrewbainFor a lot of Americans, this is a bank. ONLY one thing is worse than the financial industry dangling inappropriate products in front of poor customers, and that is not providing them with financial services at all. In December the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) released a survey that found roughly one in 12 American households, or some 17m adults, are "unbanked", meaning they lack a current or savings account. The survey also found that one in every five American households is "underbanked", meaning that they have a bank account but also rely on alternative services--typically, high-cost products such as payday loans, cheque-cashing services, non-bank money orders or pawn shops. Not all the unbanked are poor, nor do all poor people lack bank accounts. But the rate of the unbanked among low-income households (defined in the FDIC survey as those with an annual income below $15,000) is more than three times the overall rate. The proportion of poor Americans without an account compares particularly badly with other rich places (see chart). The unbanked usually have no alternative but to use cash for all their transactions. Without an account to put pay-cheques into, they have to use cheque-cashers. This does not just mean incurring a fee; carrying large amounts of cash also increases the risk and harm of theft. To pay their utility bills the unbanked need either a non-bank money order, for which they have to pay a fee, or a place that accepts utility payments in cash. When they need credit, the unbanked turn to payday lenders or, if they have a car, to car-title loans secured by their vehicles. Payday lenders say that high volumes--estimated at $29.8 billion for storefront payday lenders and $14.3 billion for online lenders in 2012--demonstrate high demand. Critics retort that much of that volume comes not from a broad customer base, but from customers taking out additional loans to cover the original debt. A study by the Centre for Financial Services Innovation, a campaign group, found that the average payday customer takes out 11 loans a year; the annual interest rate can exceed 400%. Lawmakers are taking an increasingly dim view of this: 18 states and the District of Columbia outlaw high-rate payday lending. The nascent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has held a public hearing on the subject, boosting speculation that the federal government may start regulating payday lending. Clamping down on payday loans would make more sense if regulators had not made it harder for retail banks to serve low-income Americans. The Durbin amendment--passed as part of the Dodd-Frank act in July 2010--capped interchange fees, the commission that merchants pay, on debit cards. One year earlier Congress passed the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure Act (Credit CARD Act), which reduced interest-rate increases and late fees on credit cards. The CFPB is also looking at overdraft fees. Add in persistently low interest rates, which have eaten into banksâ€™ net interest margins, and the economics of banking the poor is far less attractive than it was. Michael Poulos of Oliver Wyman, a consultancy, says that "before the crisis, almost every bank account made money. Big accounts made money on the spread, and small accounts made money on incident fees. You made money on all the accounts with interchange fees. All of that is either severely curtailed or completely gone." Oliver Wyman reckons that US banks now lose money on 37% of consumer accounts. For those concerned that their low net worth bars them from the banking system, there are two reasons for hope. The first is that lenders and credit bureaus are starting to use a broader range of data to determine the creditworthiness of prospective borrowers. Many of the unbanked have no credit histories. But data from rent, mobile-phone and utility bills give lenders a way to find lower-risk borrowers. The second reason for optimism is an increasingly competitive market in pre-paid cards. Once simply reloadable proxies for cash, many of these cards now offer much the same features as bank accounts. Consider the Bluebird card, a joint venture between Walmart, Americaâ€™s largest but decidedly downmarket retailer, and American Express, a decidedly upmarket credit-card firm. Among other things, Bluebird offers direct-deposit facilities (including an option where you can take a picture of a pay-cheque with your smartphone) and fee-free sub-accounts (so that a parent can give a child a card with preset spending limits). Pre-paid cards are not perfect: their fees can be sizeable and opaque, and they offer limited consumer protection. But they are convenient and a growing part of Americaâ€™s consumer-finance landscape. The share of unbanked households using pre-paid cards rose from 12.2% in 2009 to 17.8% in 2011. The Mercator Advisory Group forecasts a compound annual growth rate of 21% for the pre-paid card market to 2015, by when it expects the total dollar amount Americans load onto cards to be around $390 billion, more than ten times as much as in 2006. The banks may yet follow suit. Michael Barr of the University of Michigan suggests that big banks should start offering basic accounts--offering electronic payments rather than cheque-writing, for instance--that operate with either pre-paid cards or debit cards. Overdraft-proofing the debit cards and eliminating paper cheques would reduce cost and risk. Such accounts may offer banks only modest revenue, but that is still better than none.

The following are the word from the G20 final communiquÃ© that could weigh on the FX markets in coming days: - We will refrain from competitive devaluation.  - We will not target our exchange rates for competitive purposes. That sounds pretty impressive, right? No mincing words on the issue of the day. Well, you have to consider who is doing the talking. Follows is the list of G-20 countries. In my book, Canada and Australia have done a pretty good job of not manipulating their currencies (and theyâ€™ve paid a price). The other 18 players at this table are all messing with their currencies. They are doing it with either a) direct FX market intervention or b) through the backdoor, via QE in the domestic bond markets. The finance ministers all signed the communiquÃ© with their fingers crossed behind their backs. Â (Note: Add Switzerland and Hong Kong to the list of dirty floaters)  Another point from the G-20: We will move toward more market-determined exchange rate systems and exchange rate flexibility to reflect underlying fundamentals. Fundamentals? What the hell does that mean? I would argue that the â€œfundamentalsâ€ for Japan today would justify an FX rate of USDJPY 110. Did the G-20 just give a â€œgreen lightâ€ to another big move down for the Yen? Thatâ€™s my read. Then there is this final bit of G-20 fluff:  â€œWe reiterate that excess volatility of financial flows and disorderly movements in exchange rates have adverse implications for economic and financial stability.â€ To me, the key word is â€œdisorderlyâ€. Once again, what the hell is meant by disorderly? If the past 4 months of trading in the Yen crosses was not disorderly, then what is disorderly? Do we need to shed 5 big figures a week for the rest of the month before things get disorderly? I read this to mean that unless things get really out of whack in the FX markets the â€œauthoritiesâ€ are going to let the markets sort things out. So the G-20 has given the nod to the market players to push the Yen around. This is interesting as the â€œmarket playersâ€ are absolutely flush with cash.  Itâ€™s not just these big names that have gotten rich on the short Yen trade. Itâ€™s everybody who trades FX. Everybody loves a winning trade and the market always pushes beyond equilibrium levels. We shall see over the next few days if the market agrees with this assessment of the G-20â€™s words. If we do see a big break to the upside for USDJPY and EURJPY, get your seat belts on. The first 10% of the Yen correction was â€œfunâ€. The next 10% will not bring the same laughs.
The Italian general election will be held next week. Currently, the lead is held by Pier Luigi Bersani, head of Italy's left democratic party. However, that lead is narrow, and we can't rule out what the Financial Times said would be a "disaster": a Berlusconi win. Societe Generale economist Michala Marcussen tackles this issue in a new research note: COULD MR BERLUSCONI REALLY WIN?As the Italian elections (24-25 February) approach, concern that something could go wrong is mounting. Italian regulation forbids the publication of opinion polls during the two weeks that precede an election. The final polls released on 8 February, still indicated a Berlusconi victory as unlikely, but given the prior trends in opinion polls and still undecided voters, such a scenario cannot be completely excluded. Furthermore, while the opinion polls point to a majority in the lower house for Pier Bersaniâ€™s centre-left coalition, the outcome for the Senate is far less certain. At the heart of the election is the ability to pursue structural reform. This is important not just to secure Italyâ€™s long-term growth potential, but is also seen as being part of the â€šconditionalityâ€› in the event that Italy would need support from the ESM/OMT. Mr. Berlusconi has made no secret of his dislike for the current policy of austerity and structural reform. Mr. Bersani, on the other hand, has signalled that he will continue Mario Montiâ€™s policy of austerity and reform (reassuring markets and Italyâ€™s euro area partners), but at the same time securing greater social fairness in policies (reassuring the more left leaning fractions of his Common Good alliance and trade unions). Striking the right balance between these two objectives will not be easy should Mr. Bersani become Italyâ€™s new prime minister; be it with a full majority in both houses or in a coalition with Mario Monti. MARKET ISSUES: Removing the tail risk of a Berlusconi win could bring some short-term relief. How durable this would prove will then depend on the ability of the new government formed to agree and advance on a structural reform programme. As outlined above, the task will not be an easy one. Business Insider Executive Editor Joe Weisenthal will be reporting on the elections from Italy.
IvanWalsh.comThe Chinese New Year (CNY) holiday is big for retail sales.  Extending from February 9 to 15, CNY was big this year, climbing 14.7 percent from last year's holiday. "During the week, there were 203m tourists (up 15.1% yoy) and tourism income totaled RMB117.1bn (up 15.4% yoy); 440mn passengers travelled by public transportation (up 13.7% yoy)," wrote BofA Merrill Lynch Economists Xiaojia Zhi and Ting Lu.  "These strong holiday sales data reflects that China’s ordinary consumers have remained confident in China’s economic fundamentals and their wealth outlook, in our view." This, however, was the slowest pace of growth since 2009, reports Bloomberg. This deceleration has been attributable to the Chinese government's demands for a cutback in luxury and wasteful spending.  Earlier this month, luxury commercials were banned in an effort to curb corrupt gift-giving. Nevertheless, this doesn't appear to be an economic backbreaker. "Moreover, though we believe Xi’s call on frugality is positive for the economy as a whole, those wasteful spending should be too small a fraction of the total retail sales to make a material impact on growth, and the anti-corruption campaign will not likely dampen China’s overall consumption demand," wrote zhi and Lu.
