REUTERS/Chris WattieWeight lifting on Parliament Hill in Ottawa.The World Economic Forum has released its annual report of the globe's most competitive economies. The report ranks these economies on the "12 pillars of competitiveness": institutions, infrastructure, macroeconomic environment, health and primary education, higher education and training, goods market efficiency, labor market efficiency, financial market development, technological readiness, market size, business sophistication, and innovation. "Smart investment in skills and innovation is key to enhanced productivity and competitiveness," the report said. "It also supports more inclusive growth by allowing everyone to contribute to and benefit from higher levels of prosperity. Economies that consistently rank high in the competitiveness rankings are those that are able to develop, attract and retain talent, and constantly introduce new and higher value-added products and services into the market." The report adds that "while all of the pillars described above will matter to a certain extent for all economies, it is clear that they will affect different economies in different ways: the best way for Cambodia to improve its competitiveness is not the same as the best way for France to do so" because the two countries are in different stages of development. The WEF ranked 144 economies. FREE AppDownload
Wow. The Australian Bureau of Statistics says Australia’s economy added a monster 121,000 jobs in August – a massive print that has everyone bewildered. The market had been expecting 15,000 jobs added. The unemployment rate fell to 6.1%, from 6.4%. Part of the story here is that the ABS changed its methodology for the labour force survey for the August survey, which many observers suspected was behind the spike in the unemployment rate. A lot of commentators are jumping straight to statistical noise. Some have been polite about it:   Others, not so much:   So there are now more than 11.7 million Australians officially in work – an all time record. A huge amount of the gains were in part-time employment, which increased 106,700 to 3,609,200. Full-time employment increase 14,300 to 8,094,300.

APObama speaks from the State Floor of the White House on his strategy against ISIS.President Barack Obama outlined a new, expanded strategy to "degrade and ultimately destroy" the extremist group calling itself the Islamic State (also know as ISIS or ISIL) in a primetime speech Wednesday night. Speaking from the Cross Hall in the White House, Obama vowed to "eradicate" the group. "So tonight, with a new Iraqi government in place, and following consultations with allies abroad and Congress at home, I can announce that America will lead a broad coalition to roll back this terrorist threat," Obama said, according to a prepared version of his remarks. "Our objective is clear: we will degrade, and ultimately destroy, ISIL through a comprehensive and sustained counter-terrorism strategy." Ahead of Obama's speech, officials outlined elements of his plan to confront the group, involving a coalition of the U.S. and its allies in the Middle East, Europe, and elsewhere. It will include an expansion of American airstrikes on ISIS targets in both Iraq and in Syria, combined with an effort to support Iraqi and Kurdish forces in Iraq as well as moderate opposition forces in Syria. In his remarks, Obama broke his plan down into four key parts: "a systematic campaign of airstrikes against these terrorists," providing "support to forces fighting these terrorists on the ground," stepped up counterterrorism efforts to "prevent ISIL attacks," and continued "humanitarian assistance to innocent civilians who have been displaced by this terrorist organization." The president also stressed his strategy to fight ISIS would "be different from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan." "It will not involve American combat troops fighting on foreign soil," Obama said. In his speech, Obama emphasized his plan would involve what he described as "a broad coalition of partners." "Already, allies are flying planes with us over Iraq; sending arms and assistance to Iraqi Security Forces and the Syrian opposition; sharing intelligence; and providing billions of dollars in humanitarian aid," Obama said. "Secretary Kerry was in Iraq today meeting with the new government and supporting their efforts to promote unity, and in the coming days he will travel across the Middle East and Europe to enlist more partners in this fight, especially Arab nations who can help mobilize Sunni communities in Iraq and Syria to drive these terrorists from their lands." The president described this coalition as "American leadership at its best." Though he called for aggressive counterterrorism measures to prevent against potential ISIS attacks on American soil, Obama stressed the group was not an "imminent" threat in this country. However, he noted officials believe ISIS could eventually strike in the U.S. if it continues to gain power. "ISIL poses a threat to the people of Iraq and Syria, and the broader Middle East — including American citizens, personnel and facilities. If left unchecked, these terrorists could pose a growing threat beyond that region — including to the United States," Obama said. "While we have not yet detected specific plotting against our homeland, ISIL leaders have threatened America and our allies. Our intelligence community believes that thousands of foreigners — including Europeans and some Americans — have joined them in Syria and Iraq. Trained and battle-hardened, these fighters could try to return to their home countries and carry out deadly attacks." ISIS gained power in Syria during the ongoing civil war there against the regime of President Bashar Assad that began in 2011. Recently, the group has made territorial gains in neighboring Iraq. Obama said his strategy to confront ISIS would involve "ramped up" assistance to more moderate elements of the Syrian opposition and efforts to pursue a "political solution" there. "In the fight against ISIL, we cannot rely on an Assad regime that terrorizes its people; a regime that will never regain the legitimacy it has lost," Obama said. "Instead, we must strengthen the opposition as the best counterweight to extremists like ISIL, while pursuing the political solution necessary to solve Syria’s crisis once and for all." Obama described his strategy to confront ISIS as similar to previous U.S. military operations in Somalia and Yemen. "This strategy of taking out terrorists who threaten us, while supporting partners on the front lines, is one that we have successfully pursued in Yemen and Somalia for years," Obama said. As part of the Obama administration's efforts to build the "coalition" to confront ISIS, Kerry traveled Wednesday to Iraq and Jordan. Obama talked on the phone with Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah. The White House said the two agreed on "need for increased training and equipping of the moderate Syrian opposition." As part of Obama's plan to confront ISIS, he will also request that Congress include so-called "Title 10" authority under the U.S. code in a must-pass spending bill that is up for a vote this month. This would allow the U.S. to ramp up training and equipping of moderate groups fighting both ISIS and the Assad regime in Syria. "I believe we are strongest as a nation when the President and Congress work together. So I welcome congressional support for this effort in order to show the world that Americans are united in confronting this danger," Obama said. The administration went on a full-court press with members of Congress on Wednesday to get the authority included in the bill. A senior administration official said both Obama and Vice President Joe Biden were making calls to members, and counterterrorism adviser Lisa Monaco is on Capitol Hill to meet with lawmakers. The White House believes its request needs to be tackled now and that the continuing resolution is the best mechanism by which to complete it. Obama's speech comes one year after he delivered another primetime address calling on Congress to authorize U.S. airstrikes against Assad regime targets in Syria. He ultimately dropped that request to pursue a diplomatic solution. Of course, Obama's remarks also come on the eve of the 13th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on U.S. soil. Here's the full prepared text of the president's speech: My fellow Americans – tonight, I want to speak to you about what the United States will do with our friends and allies to degrade and ultimately destroy the terrorist group known as ISIL.   As Commander-in-Chief, my highest priority is the security of the American people. Over the last several years, we have consistently taken the fight to terrorists who threaten our country. We took out Osama bin Laden and much of al Qaeda’s leadership in Afghanistan and Pakistan. We’ve targeted al Qaeda’s affiliate in Yemen, and recently eliminated the top commander of its affiliate in Somalia. We’ve done so while bringing more than 140,000 American troops home from Iraq, and drawing down our forces in Afghanistan, where our combat mission will end later this year. Thanks to our military and counterterrorism professionals, America is safer.  Still, we continue to face a terrorist threat. We cannot erase every trace of evil from the world, and small groups of killers have the capacity to do great harm. That was the case before 9/11, and that remains true today. That’s why we must remain vigilant as threats emerge. At this moment, the greatest threats come from the Middle East and North Africa, where radical groups exploit grievances for their own gain. And one of those groups is ISIL – which calls itself the “Islamic State.” Now let’s make two things clear: ISIL is not “Islamic.” No religion condones the killing of innocents, and the vast majority of ISIL’s victims have been Muslim. And ISIL is certainly not a state. It was formerly al Qaeda’s affiliate in Iraq, and has taken advantage of sectarian strife and Syria’s civil war to gain territory on both sides of the Iraq-Syrian border. It is recognized by no government, nor the people it subjugates. ISIL is a terrorist organization, pure and simple. And it has no vision other than the slaughter of all who stand in its way. In a region that has known so much bloodshed, these terrorists are unique in their brutality. They execute captured prisoners. They kill children. They enslave, rape, and force women into marriage. They threatened a religious minority with genocide. In acts of barbarism, they took the lives of two American journalists – Jim Foley and Steven Sotloff. So ISIL poses a threat to the people of Iraq and Syria, and the broader Middle East – including American citizens, personnel and facilities. If left unchecked, these terrorists could pose a growing threat beyond that region – including to the United States. While we have not yet detected specific plotting against our homeland, ISIL leaders have threatened America and our allies. Our intelligence community believes that thousands of foreigners – including Europeans and some Americans – have joined them in Syria and Iraq. Trained and battle-hardened, these fighters could try to return to their home countries and carry out deadly attacks. I know many Americans are concerned about these threats. Tonight, I want you to know that the United States of America is meeting them with strength and resolve. Last month, I ordered our military to take targeted action against ISIL to stop its advances. Since then, we have conducted more than 150 successful airstrikes in Iraq. These strikes have protected American personnel and facilities, killed ISIL fighters, destroyed weapons, and given space for Iraqi and Kurdish forces to reclaim key territory. These strikes have helped save the lives of thousands of innocent men, women and children.  But this is not our fight alone. American power can make a decisive difference, but we cannot do for Iraqis what they must do for themselves, nor can we take the place of Arab partners in securing their region. That’s why I’ve insisted that additional U.S. action depended upon Iraqis forming an inclusive government, which they have now done in recent days. So tonight, with a new Iraqi government in place, and following consultations with allies abroad and Congress at home, I can announce that America will lead a broad coalition to roll back this terrorist threat. Our objective is clear: we will degrade, and ultimately destroy, ISIL through a comprehensive and sustained counter-terrorism strategy. First, we will conduct a systematic campaign of airstrikes against these terrorists. Working with the Iraqi government, we will expand our efforts beyond protecting our own people and humanitarian missions, so that we’re hitting ISIL targets as Iraqi forces go on offense. Moreover, I have made it clear that we will hunt down terrorists who threaten our country, wherever they are. That means I will not hesitate to take action against ISIL in Syria, as well as Iraq. This is a core principle of my presidency: if you threaten America, you will find no safe haven.  Second, we will increase our support to forces fighting these terrorists on the ground. In June, I deployed several hundred American service members to Iraq to assess how we can best support Iraqi Security Forces. Now that those teams have completed their work – and Iraq has formed a government – we will send an additional 475 service members to Iraq. As I have said before, these American forces will not have a combat mission – we will not get dragged into another ground war in Iraq. But they are needed to support Iraqi and Kurdish forces with training, intelligence and equipment. We will also support Iraq’s efforts to stand up National Guard Units to help Sunni communities secure their own freedom from ISIL control.  Across the border, in Syria, we have ramped up our military assistance to the Syrian opposition. Tonight, I again call on Congress to give us additional authorities and resources to train and equip these fighters. In the fight against ISIL, we cannot rely on an Assad regime that terrorizes its people; a regime that will never regain the legitimacy it has lost. Instead, we must strengthen the opposition as the best counterweight to extremists like ISIL, while pursuing the political solution necessary to solve Syria’s crisis once and for all.  Third, we will continue to draw on our substantial counterterrorism capabilities to prevent ISIL attacks. Working with our partners, we will redouble our efforts to cut off its funding; improve our intelligence; strengthen our defenses; counter its warped ideology; and stem the flow of foreign fighters into – and out of – the Middle East. And in two weeks, I will chair a meeting of the UN Security Council to further mobilize the international community around this effort. Fourth, we will continue providing humanitarian assistance to innocent civilians who have been displaced by this terrorist organization. This includes Sunni and Shia Muslims who are at grave risk, as well as tens of thousands of Christians and other religious minorities. We cannot allow these communities to be driven from their ancient homelands.  This is our strategy. And in each of these four parts of our strategy, America will be joined by a broad coalition of partners. Already, allies are flying planes with us over Iraq; sending arms and assistance to Iraqi Security Forces and the Syrian opposition; sharing intelligence; and providing billions of dollars in humanitarian aid. Secretary Kerry was in Iraq today meeting with the new government and supporting their efforts to promote unity, and in the coming days he will travel across the Middle East and Europe to enlist more partners in this fight, especially Arab nations who can help mobilize Sunni communities in Iraq and Syria to drive these terrorists from their lands. This is American leadership at its best: we stand with people who fight for their own freedom; and we rally other nations on behalf of our common security and common humanity.  My Administration has also secured bipartisan support for this approach here at home. I have the authority to address the threat from ISIL. But I believe we are strongest as a nation when the President and Congress work together. So I welcome congressional support for this effort in order to show the world that Americans are united in confronting this danger. Now, it will take time to eradicate a cancer like ISIL. And any time we take military action, there are risks involved – especially to the servicemen and women who carry out these missions. But I want the American people to understand how this effort will be different from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. It will not involve American combat troops fighting on foreign soil. This counter-terrorism campaign will be waged through a steady, relentless effort to take out ISIL wherever they exist, using our air power and our support for partner forces on the ground. This strategy of taking out terrorists who threaten us, while supporting partners on the front lines, is one that we have successfully pursued in Yemen and Somalia for years. And it is consistent with the approach I outlined earlier this year: to use force against anyone who threatens America’s core interests, but to mobilize partners wherever possible to address broader challenges to international order.  My fellow Americans, we live in a time of great change. Tomorrow marks 13 years since our country was attacked.  Next week marks 6 years since our economy suffered its worst setback since the Great Depression. Yet despite these shocks; through the pain we have felt and the grueling work required to bounce back – America is better positioned today to seize the future than any other nation on Earth.  Our technology companies and universities are unmatched; our manufacturing and auto industries are thriving.  Energy independence is closer than it’s been in decades.  For all the work that remains, our businesses are in the longest uninterrupted stretch of job creation in our history.  Despite all the divisions and discord within our democracy, I see the grit and determination and common goodness of the American people every single day – and that makes me more confident than ever about our country’s future. Abroad, American leadership is the one constant in an uncertain world. It is America that has the capacity and the will to mobilize the world against terrorists. It is America that has rallied the world against Russian aggression, and in support of the Ukrainian peoples’ right to determine their own destiny. It is America – our scientists, our doctors, our know-how – that can help contain and cure the outbreak of Ebola. It is America that helped remove and destroy Syria’s declared chemical weapons so they cannot pose a threat to the Syrian people – or the world – again. And it is America that is helping Muslim communities around the world not just in the fight against terrorism, but in the fight for opportunity, tolerance, and a more hopeful future. America, our endless blessings bestow an enduring burden. But as Americans, we welcome our responsibility to lead. From Europe to Asia – from the far reaches of Africa to war-torn capitals of the Middle East – we stand for freedom, for justice, for dignity. These are values that have guided our nation since its founding.  Tonight, I ask for your support in carrying that leadership forward. I do so as a Commander-in-Chief who could not be prouder of our men and women in uniform – pilots who bravely fly in the face of danger above the Middle East, and service-members who support our partners on the ground.  When we helped prevent the massacre of civilians trapped on a distant mountain, here’s what one of them said. “We owe our American friends our lives. Our children will always remember that there was someone who felt our struggle and made a long journey to protect innocent people.” That is the difference we make in the world. And our own safety – our own security – depends upon our willingness to do what it takes to defend this nation, and uphold the values that we stand for – timeless ideals that will endure long after those who offer only hate and destruction have been vanquished from the Earth. May God bless our troops, and may God bless the United States of America.     (This post was updated at 9:52 p.m.)  FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersA woman looks at clothes at Tokyo's Sugamo district, an area popular among the Japanese elderly, in TokyoBy Tetsushi Kajimoto TOKYO (Reuters) - Confidence at big Japanese manufacturers turned positive in July-September and they expect business conditions to improve further in the following quarter, a government survey showed, suggesting a gradual economic recovery from the slump after April's sales tax hike. The survey also showed that companies are growing more positive on business investment, boding well for the government's goal of fostering a sustainable growth cycle led by pick up in business activity, higher wages and stronger consumer spending. The business survey index (BSI) of sentiment at large manufacturers stood at plus 12.7 in July-September, improving from minus 13.9 in the prior three months. The big manufacturers' sentiment index is seen improving to plus 15.1 in October-December, it showed. The joint survey by the Ministry of Finance and the Cabinet Office suggests that the central bank's key tankan survey out on Oct.1 is likely to show a steady improvement in business sentiment in the three months to September. "It's true business sentiment soured temporarily after the April sales tax hike. But that hasn't dampened companies' spending appetite too much," said Junko Nishioka, chief Japan economist at RBS Securities. "Overall, conditions surrounding corporate activity doesn't look too bad." Weak readings in the BOJ's tankan could heighten pressure on the Bank of Japan to deliver fresh stimulus to sustain growth, although the bank remains bullish on the economy and it is in no mood now to loosen hyper-easy monetary policy further. The April's sales tax hike to 8 percent from 5 percent triggered the deepest slump in the second quarter since the 2009 global financial crisis, raising questions about whether the government will proceed with a second-stage tax rise planned for next year. The strength of an expected rebound in the current quarter will be crucial to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's decision, expected by year-end, on whether to go ahead with the tax rise to 10 percent in October 2015. The BSI measures the percentage of firms that expect the business environment to improve from the previous quarter minus the percentage that expect it to worsen. A positive reading means optimists outnumber pessimists. The quarterly survey showed the sentiment among big non-manufacturers, including retailers hit hard by the tax hike, improving to plus 10.2 from minus 15.0 in April-June, bringing the overall mood among big businesses to plus 11.1. The service-sector mood is expected to worsen to plus 7.2 in October-December, and overall big business sentiment is seen worsening to plus 9.9, it showed. Manufacturers plan to raise capital expenditure by 13.3 percent in the current fiscal year to next March, more than a 10.8 percent increase seen in the previous survey. Non-manufacturers plan to raise their business investment by 2.0 percent this fiscal year, compared with a 1.5 percent rise seen in the prior survey. The last BOJ tankan showed on July 1 that big manufacturers' mood worsened in the three months to June but it was seen improving in the current quarter. The central bank stuck with its massive asset buying stimulus program last week and maintained its view the economy would continue its steady recovery toward its 2 percent inflation target, signaling it sees no immediate need for further monetary stimulus. However, many private economists remain skeptical that it can achieve that price goal in the next fiscal year.

Thomson ReutersAn American Airlines airplane takes off from Heathrow airport in LondonBy Jeffrey Dastin (Reuters) - American Airlines has won regulatory approval to swap flight attendants' paper manuals for lighter Samsung tablets in a change that will save nearly $1 million a year, the company said on Wednesday. The move, which does not yet affect attendants at American Airlines Group Inc's  subsidiary US Airways, comes little more than a year after American's cockpit went paperless, and is one of many strategies that airlines have pursued to reduce weight and fuel costs. Delta Air Lines  and United Airlines  have also distributed smart devices to their pilots, and Delta plans to roll out an e-manual for flight attendants starting in October. American said its attendants already have the tablets, and those at US Airways will receive them after the combined company receives a single operating certificate from the Federal Aviation Administration. The timing of that is uncertain. "Conserving fuel is important to an airline because it is a huge cost," said American Airlines spokesperson Andrea Huguely. American stock rose 1.63 percent Wednesday to close at $38.58. American and Delta see smart devices as a boon to cabin service, allowing attendants to see where premium customers are seated and direct more attention to them, the spokespeople said. Tablets also will simplify in-flight food and beverage sales. Delta is "arming our flight attendants to help deliver more personalized customer assistance," said Kate Modolo, a Delta spokesperson. When American replaced roughly 35-lb pilot bags with 1.2-lb iPads, it said it would save $1.2 million in fuel costs annually. Switching to tablets from nearly 5-lb flight attendant manuals only will net the airline $650,000 a year. The remaining $300,000 in savings will come from reduced printing and shipping costs. Airlines are "looking for lots of little things that together - $300,000 at a time - could add up to real money," said industry consultant Robert Mann. Since 2005, American Airlines has saved 1 billion gallons of fuel under a program called Fuel Smart, Huguely said. Initiatives have ranged from pilots using only a single engine during taxiing when this is deemed safe, to removing antiquated phones attached to the seat backs of old planes, saving weight. After years of losses, U.S. airlines have been profitable over the last four years. Last quarter, American posted the best results in its history.

REUTERS/Tim Wimborne A sheet of uncut Australian twenty dollar notes are displayed at the Reserve Bank of Australia in Sydney.Good morning! Let’s start Thursday… 1. There’s an Ebola scare in Australia. A man was being taken to isolation at Gold Coast University hospital this morning by paramedics in protective suits. He returned from Africa just days ago, where the Ebola outbreak has been rampant and has now killed almost 2,300 people, according to the latest official estimates. Health officials say they have prepared for such an event on World Health Organisation guidance. 2. It’s jobs day in Australia. The market’s expecting 15,000 jobs added for August, which would be a solid result, and the unemployment rate is expected to tick down to 6.3%. The spike the unemployment rate to 6.4% last month was a big shock, and the headlines could have hit consumer confidence which we’ve seen sinking in recent weeks on the ANZ-Roy Morgan weekly survey, and again in the more established Westpac-Melbourne Institute survey out yesterday. There’s a particular focus for markets on this number today because… 3. The Australian dollar is still getting smoked, and hit a six-month low overnight. “Buy the dip” simply didn’t work for traders during yesterday’s session as the battler drifted ever lower during the session. Overnight the Aussie hit US91.10 cents before finding some buyers who finally propped it back up to just over the US91.50c mark. Look at it go: Watch for that jobs number at 11.30am AEST – we’ll have live coverage on Business Insider. 4. We need to talk about pay. There are headlines this morning about a pay freeze at Coca-Cola Amatil, and new hires coming in on salaries significantly lower than the existing workforce. The CCA deal is a dramatic one but it is not an isolated incident – companies everywhere are starting to rein in wage increases in order to remain competitive at the global level. As Greg McKenna writes this morning, this is something Australia needs to talk about – there have been warnings for some time that wages can’t keep up with inflation, and people need to plan for some lifestyle adjustments as a result. 5. To the markets, and the US bourses posted gains with the Nasdaq leading the way, up 0.7%, while the Dow was up 0.3% and the S&amp;P 500 was up 0.4%. Asian markets were soft yesterday with Shanghai down 0.4% after a run of strong recent gains, but the Hang Seng had a horror fall of 1.9%. The Nikkei was up, though, 0.3%. As well as the jobs data in Australia today, we get Chinese CPI this morning. ASX futures are up 18 points ahead of the open. 6. Two things you should read about Scottish independence. There’s growing momentum behind the Scottish independence movement ahead of the referendum on breaking from the UK on September 18. George Soros points out it comes at a terrible time for the “unfinished” European project, and could hasten Europe’s retreat from the world at at time of growing nationalism and when there are looming threats to the stability of the region, particularly in Ukraine. And Credit Suisse’s opinion: Scotland would fall into a deep recession. 7. Extremists have planned a terrorist attack in Australia, according to a report in The Australian this morning. There’s no evidence that a bomb has been built but the reported resolve of extremists to carry out an attack is one of the decisive factors behind the anticipated raising of the national terrorism alert level in the coming days. Meanwhile, Barack Obama has outlined his strategy for dealing with ISIS. 8. The questions Apple didn’t answer. It was quite a show yesterday and no doubt the records are set to tumble when the iPhone 6 goes on sale next week. So does it really matter if Apple’s reality distortion field is starting to crumble? No. Regardless, here’s some choice questions that the most watched tech company in the world failed to answer yesterday. We’d also add “Why is the iPhone 6 so darned heavy, despite being so thin?” 9. Australia’s Netflix. Fairfax Media and Nine have teamed up for a $100 million media joint venture, StreamCo, which will offer streaming TV and movies. CEO Mike Sneesby has told Business Insider that there’ll be some big-name TV shows exclusive to the platform and he expects the streaming media audience in Australia to be between 2.5 million to 4 million within a few years. With Foxtel improving its digital products and about to drop its prices dramatically, and an arrival of Netflix seen as a practical certainty, the (justified) grumbling about how Australian audiences are consistently ripped off by media companies might well start to fade by next year. 10. Dreamliner workers spill the beans. This has litigation written all over it, but a documentary about to air claims to show secret conversations with Boeing workers about whether they’d fly on the new Dreamliner jet, which rolled out years over its production target date and has had several high-profile incidents since launch. Ten of the 15 workers secretly filmed said they wouldn’t fly on the Dreamliner. Boeing is saying the documentary is “as biased a production as we have seen in some time”.

Thomson ReutersA man walks past posters with pictures of Argentina's President Fernandez de Kirchner and U.S. for the Southern District of New York Judge Griesa, depicted as Uncle Sam, near the Argentine Congress in Buenos AiresBy Walter Bianchi and Richard Lough BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - The Argentine government said on Wednesday that its refusal to repay a group of U.S. hedge funds that stand to profit on the country's defaulted debt was vindicated by the United Nations' support for a multilateral plan handling bond restructurings. The lengthy legal battle between Argentina and the funds that snapped up its bonds on the cheap after its record 2002 default and are suing for 100 cents on the dollar led to the Buenos Aires government defaulting again in July. Cabinet Chief Jorge Capitanich's comments came on the same day the lower house of Congress held a marathon debate over a draft law proposing to remodel the country's debt to enable it to skirt U.S. court rulings in support of the hedge funds. The lower house is expected to vote in favor of the bill in the early hours of Thursday. But the law may not achieve much if legal hurdles and investor scepticism prevent the proposed restructuring measures from being implemented. President Cristina Fernandez says her country is the victim of "vulture funds" that are prepared to wreck its finances in their pursuit of huge profits. She wants a global framework that would prevent a minority of investors from scuppering debt restructuring agreements. Prompted by Argentina and its ally Bolivia, the U.N. General Assembly voted overwhelmingly in favor of such a convention. "If 124 countries in the United Nations support the Republic of Argentina, it means that Argentina is right in its claims," Capitanich told reporters in Buenos Aires. The July default took place after a New York court barred Argentina from servicing debt that was restructured under U.S. law until the government settled with the distressed-debt experts who rejected the terms of bond swaps in 2005 and 2010. When the Buenos Aires government deposited a $539 million coupon payment with a U.S. intermediary bank in June, U.S. District Judge Thomas Griesa blocked the payment.  A DOOMED ATTEMPT? Fernandez has accused Griesa of overstepping his bounds and interfering in Argentina's national sovereignty. Her response, a bill that would allow the government to make its debt payments locally, or elsewhere beyond the reaches of Griesa's court, has sailed through Congress so far. The Senate upper house passed it last week. The bill also pushes investors to move their Argentine debt from the United States to a new jurisdiction. "Given we could not pay in New York, we are trying with this law to pay in Buenos Aires, in France or to let creditors propose other trustees in order to be able to pay," said Roberto Feletti, a lawmaker from the ruling coalition. "Argentina's decision is to pay and to fulfill its commitments with this debt restructuring." But Economy Minister Axel Kicillof acknowledged on Tuesday bondholders had little appetite for the swap plan. Investors and critics are concerned about the law's legal and logistical challenges and have underscored the lack of financial incentive to participate. Griesa has called the bond swap plan "illegal" but stopped short of holding Argentina in contempt. In a hearing on Wednesday, he said he would wait for a decision on an appeal before ordering Citigroup Inc  to comply with a subpoena seeking details of threats from Argentina to process payments the court had blocked.

Thomson ReutersThe exterior of a RadioShack store is seen in the Queens borough of New York(Reuters) - UBS AG  along with investment firm Standard General LP is financing a rescue package for RadioShack Corp  as the electronics retailer tries to ward off bankruptcy, Bloomberg reported, quoting three people with knowledge of the matter. RadioShack's shares were up 6.3 percent at $0.99 after markets closed. The money raised would be used to refinance debt outstanding under a $535 million asset-backed revolving credit line from General Electric Co  unit GE Capital, the report said quoting unidentified sources. The success of the package would depend on whether creditors, including Salus Capital Partners LLC, agree to terms that would allow RadioShack to shutter additional stores, Bloomberg said. RadioShack was not immediately available for comment. The company tried to close 1,100 stores this year, but lenders did not agree with the plans, forcing it to curb the closings to 200 stores a year. Brokerage Wedbush Securities said on Tuesday the company could file for bankruptcy soon, making the stock worthless by the end of this year. Wedbush analysts cut its price target on the stock to $0 from $1. The company reported its ninth straight quarterly loss in June and is burning cash as it struggles to sustain its turnaround efforts, which have so far failed to bear fruit. It will report second-quarter results on Thursday. RadioShack's stores, which have been around for more than 90 years, were once the go-to shops for budding innovators and engineers for products that ranged from vacuum tube speakers to the first mass-produced PC, the TRS-80.

Nick Tininenko / Stringer / Getty ImagesThey seem happy ... but how are their bank accounts?Every three years, the Federal Reserve Board releases its Survey of Consumer Finances, and the latest version was presented in September. As Business Insider's Elena Holodny points out, the data shows the highest earners in the United States "bouncing back nicely" after the recession, contributing to a growing wealth gap. What else does the Fed say? You can see the data, watch a video about its findings ... or scroll down for the video highlights. The video first examines household income, a key measure of economic well-being. The fact that mean income is above median income every year, the Fed points out, reflects the disproportionate amount of wealth at the top of the income spectrum. Federal Reserve Board The wealth gap is also illustrated by this data, which shows mean income growing faster than median income for 14 years, from a 60% difference between the two measures in 1989 to a 90% difference in 2013.  The fact that mean income dropped faster than median income between 2007 and 2010 shows the exaggerated impact of the recession on the country's wealthiest. Federal Reserve Board The report segments earners into three income groups, with mean income ranging from $27,000 to $397,500 between the lowest and highest income groups — over 14 times as much. The 2014 poverty line is $23,850 for a family of four. Federal Reserve Board Between 2007 and 2010, mean income declined for all three of the income groups illustrated above. Between 2010 and 2013, however, income increased for the highest group, while decreasing for the lowest and staying about the same for the group in the middle.  In 2013, the video says, every income group had a lower mean income than in 2007. Federal Reserve Board The report also used wealth to measure economic well-being. Below is the mean wealth for all three cohorts. Federal Reserve Board Like income, mean wealth has been consistently higher than median wealth, reflecting that same disproportionate distribution. Again, the gap has only gotten wider in past years. Federal Reserve Board Between 2007 and 2010, mean wealth among all three groups declined. Between 2010 and 2013, however, wealth declined only in the lowest income group. Both the middle and highest income groups showed an increase in mean wealth. Federal Reserve Board The third measure listed in the report is homeownership, which declined among all three groups between 2007 and 2010. Between 2010 and 2013, though, only the highest income group saw an increase in homeownership.  Federal Reserve Board Mean net housing wealth (the value of housing minus any related debts) has declined among all three groups between 2007 and 2013.  The sharp drop between 2007 and 2010 in particular is credited to a decline in average house prices, along with a reduction of mortgages and other housing debts.  Federal Reserve Board The report then turns its attention to education borrowing, singling out families whose heads are younger than 40. Between 2001 and 2013, the mean value of education loans increased from $16,900 to $29,00, and the median from $10,500 to $16,800. Federal Reserve Board You can see in the pie charts below that while the majority of families still owe less than $25,000 in education debt, more families have taken on larger amounts of debt in 2013 than in 2001. Debt burdens between $50,000 and $100,000 more than doubled in those 12 years, and debt of over $100,000 went from 1% to 6%. Federal Reserve Board Finally, the report examines the distribution of education debt among income levels, finding that families with an income below $30,000 doubled between 2001 and 2013, making up about a quarter of total education debt.  The decline in debt among the middle income group means that the highest income group, earning over $60,000, still holds about half the total debt.

Wikipedia CommonsHave you ever wondered what the economy looked like in the year 1 AD? Deutsche Bank released a note that included a chart of major global economies in the first year of the common era. They're ranked by "economic power,"  which is measured in terms of economic output compared to the total world output. Unsurprisingly, Augustus' Roman Empire ranked first. It controlled slightly over 25% of total world output. Rome's largest competitors, Parthia (whose modern territory is roughly modern day Iran) and Germany controlled only 2% and 1%, respectively, of the global economic output. Deutsche Bank's note added that, "whilst economic output is not the only important variable in understanding the ability of a nation or empire to exert global power, it is probably the most important basic element as it determines the total pool of resources that can be devoted to war." Deutsche Bank "Here the 'world' is defined as the empire's contemporaries would have thought of it — as Western Europe, North Africa and the Middle East," noted Reid. As you can see from the chart, certain empires such as China under the Han Dynasty are excluded. FREE AppDownload
ReutersThe richest man in Asia.SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Asia's richest man, Li Ka-shing, aims to buy his way into the global aircraft leasing business as his flagship investment firm holds talks with lessors on building a portfolio of planes, people with direct knowledge of the matter said. In a potential series of deals, the Hong Kong tycoon's Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd is in discussions to form a joint venture with Mitsubishi Corp's MC Aviation Partners leasing arm, one executive said. Li's firm is already bidding for a $5 billion fleet of 100 planes that lessor AWAS Aviation Capital Ltd has put up for sale. The move by Li, who runs a global business spanning everything from property to energy, is part of a strategy to recraft the group's investments outside Hong Kong, targeting stable returns in a fast-growing industry. As global air travel booms, carriers are opting to lease new planes rather than buying them, saving on huge capital outlays upfront. "They (Cheung Kong) have their fingers in a lot of pies at the same time," said one executive, who declined to be identified as the information is not public. "They have huge ambitions and are looking to become a top global lessor." Mitsubishi Corp and MC Aviation declined to comment. Cheung Kong didn't respond to requests for comment from Reuters. Analysts say Li will be looking to take full advantage of his group's financial muscle to make a success of the new strategy. However, as interest in the aircraft leasing sector grows, that approach may push target valuations higher. "Obviously, buying a large fleet would sort of indicate that they are trying to get big overnight. But I'm not really sure this is the best time to get into the market," said Ilya Ivashkov, a New York-based senior director at Fitch Ratings. "It seems like things are definitely getting a little bit overheated, especially in some pockets of the market," he said. Industry publication Flightglobal estimates the top 50 lessors have a total fleet of more than 7,500 planes valued at nearly $200 billion. Dominating the pack are GECAS, a unit of General Electric Co., and International Lease Finance Corp, now part of AerCap, the world's two biggest lessors. But lessors backed by Chinese state-owned banks are also growing as the world's second-biggest economy provides much of the potential growth in demand for aircraft. Plane maker Boeing Co &lt;ba.n&gt; estimates China alone will need over 6,000 new aircraft over the next 20 years. FINANCIAL CLOUT Li's companies have raised about $9 billion just this year by selling stakes in Hong Kong firms. The group is on the hunt for stable investment options in well-regulated markets outside its home market, where expansion opportunities are becoming limited. The venture with MC Aviation, which owns and manages about 100 mostly-narrow body jets, will give Cheung Kong access to a pool of about 20 aircraft. It will help the firm tap into the management expertise of Mitsubishi's fully-owned Tokyo subsidiary, which was set up in 2008 with over 20 years of experience in aircraft leasing. Details of the venture are still being worked out and an announcement is expected in a couple of weeks, one executive said. For Mitsubishi, the transaction will bring some returns on its investment in MC Aviation, which could also strike other deals with Cheung Kong as the new entrant grows its leasing business, the executive said. The plans for MC Aviation and AWAS deals aren't the only aircraft leasing avenues Li is exploring. Cheung Kong has also approached large lessors to buy about 20 planes in a single transaction, executives said. Aircraft leases offer fixed incomes for long periods and are often seen as safe transactions. Priced in U.S. dollars, aircraft are comparatively easy to re-lease to different geographies. Besides AWAS, another Dublin-based aircraft lessor, Avolon, has attracted Asian interest. China's sovereign wealth fund, China Investment Corp, has teamed up with state-owned aerospace and defense company, Aviation Industry Corporation of China, in its bid to buy Avolon, Reuters previously reported. Over the past few years, access to cheap funding has driven expansion plans of the leasing arms of Asian groups, including Bank of China, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. "The key thing that drives stability in our sector is the strength of the balance sheet in the leasing companies and we have seen some consolidation over the last year," Robert Martin, chief executive of Asia's No. 2 lessor BOC Aviation, said in a recent interview.

VUW & MOSOOnly in New York.  A new residential building in Soho is selling its 10 underground parking spots for $1 million a pop, The New York Times reports. Even for Manhattan, the price is astronomical. According to the Times, residential parking spots run an average of $136,052, or about an eighth the cost of the spots at 42 Crosby Street.  But with the condos selling for $8.7 million to $25 million, maybe a million for parking isn't out of the question. "We’re looking at setting the benchmark," Shaun Osher, the founder and chief executive of the brokerage firm which is handling the sales and marketing at 42 Crosby, told the Times. "In real estate, location defines value and parking is no exception to that rule." According to the Times, residents would be shelling out between $5,000 and $6,666 per square foot for the parking spots, in comparison to about $3,150 per square foot for their actual apartment. Owners will essentially have the parking spot for life (or 99 years), but would have to sell if they ever moved out of the Annabelle Selldorf-designed building. FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Carlos BarriaFA Insights is a daily newsletter from Business Insider that delivers the top news and commentary for financial advisors.  The Number Of American Investors Who Want Financial Advice Is Growing  (WealthManagement.com) The number of American investors who are looking for financial advice increased from 24% in 2013 to 35% in 2014, according to the third annual Advice Matters survey. However, even though the number is rising, the majority of Americans are still not interested in any advice at all. "Those who aren't interested in advice may not know what it includes or how valuable it can be," Eric Jones, senior managing director of advisory solutions at TIAA-CREF told Wealth Management's Megan Leonhardt. The major issue for most people with financial advisors is trust. Some 65% of those polled stated that "it's difficult to know which sources of advice can be trusted", which is a 16% increase from the 2013 survey. The second most common issue is cost. 44% of respondents believe that "good financial advice will cost more than they can afford." Why We Shouldn't Worry About A Global Economic Slowdown (Blackrock Blog) There are some signs out there that suggest global growth is slowing. But BlackRock thinks we shouldn't get too worried. First of all, the majority of global manufacturing surveys suggest that global growth is stable, and there are even indications that it might be growing. The global purchasing managers index (PMI) has remained around 52.5 for the majority of the year, and the services component has "improved recently." Secondly, credit spread "remains tight" at the moment. Widening credit spreads are associated with "deteriorating" conditions, and are associated with slower growth. On the flip side, "tight" spread has typically been associated with faster growth. And finally, industrial metals prices remain "steady." Blackrock's Russ Koesterich writes that, "while gold prices have been selling off, prices of industrial metals have been more stable. This is relevant for global growth. Given industrial commodities’ sensitivity to economic activity, increases in their prices tend to have a positive correlation with global growth. Using the Journal of Commerce Index of Industrial Metals as a proxy, industrial metal prices have been holding their own. The index is up around 8% from the spring lows and 7% year over year. On this metric, there is little evidence of a global slowdown." Merrill Edge Is Looking To Double Its Advisor Number Over The Next Two Years (Financial Advisor) Bank of America Merrill Lynch's dual "online/in-person service for mass-market clients, Merrill Edge, is planning to double its number of financial advisors by the end of 2016," Aron Levin, the head of Preferred Banking and Merrill Edge Investing, told Ted Knutson. Right now there are 1,500 Merrill Edge advisors in Bank of America's retail branch network. This move would increase that number 3,000 — meaning that 60% of Bank of America's branches would now have a Merrill Edge advisor. This doubling comes with two goals: first of all, it will provide face-to-face financial support to more clients. And secondly, this will expose clients to BAML and U.S. Trust services "as they attain more assets and their personal wealth grows." Merrill Edge was started in 2010, and aims to work with clients who have $50,000 to $250,000 in investible assets. Say Hello To The $1 Billion Super Ensemble Advisory Firms (Investment News) The advisor firm landscape is quickly changing. "Rapid growth has created a new type of advisory firm — a large, sophisticated, aggressive, multioffice enterprise with a clear strategy for even more growth", according to InvestmentNews Financial Research. Namely, the new "Super Ensemble" advisory firm. Only four years ago, a "Super Ensemble" a firm was considered to be "Super Ensemble" if it had at least $1 billion in AUM. Nowadays they need to have at least $10 billion. On average, these firms rake in an annual revenue of $17 million,. On top of that, they're "rapidly growing", seeing 18.6% growth. They're closely followed by "Enterprise Ensemble" firms (those between $5-10 million), which saw 17.5% growth. Even though smaller Enterprise firms and solo firms see the slowest average growth rate, it does not mean that they are unsuccessful.  The Popularity Of Indexing Is Rising, But Investors Are Worried (Vanguard) Even though many investors like the concept of indexing, others think that it's getting too big. Vanguard's Chris Philips writes that "there's always going to be questions out there whenever you see popularity of anything rising," and cites Apple, Microsoft, and Exxon as examples. He adds that people regard indexing in a similar fashion, and are asking: "is there a tipping point for indexing, and should we be concerned by that?"  Another problem with indexing is that it leads to market inefficiencies. Philips stated that as indexing becomes more popular, "it'll lead investors to have portfolios that are more inefficiently managed. And the thinking behind that is that index fund, ETFs, they generally are priced at the day's close. So they are building up their portfolios. And if a majority of monies are actually passively managed, then the price-discovery process of active managers is marginalized. If that takes place, then, the theory goes, you could actually end up with more inefficiencies in the marketplace, more arbitrage opportunities, poorly priced equities or fixed income investments."

AP ImagesLegendary investor George Soros is out with a warning about Scottish Independence.When it comes to the intersection of politics, finance, and European history, there's nobody better to listen to than the renowned investor George Soros. Soros wrote the indispensable essay during the worst of the eurozone's economic crisis back in 2012. Now, in a new essay, Soros has now weighed in on the Scottish independence referendum — coming up on Sept. 18 — arguing that now would be the worst possible time for Scotland to leave the U.K. (and for the U.K. to leave the E.U., which is also a possibility down the road). The gist is that Europe, a key keeper of order since World War II, is under renewed threat and has been turning inward. And Scottish independence would accelerate Europe's pulling back from the world, he warns. He writes: This is the worst possible time for Britain to consider leaving the EU – or for Scotland to break with Britain. The EU is an unfinished project of European states that have sacrificed part of their sovereignty to form an ever-closer union based on shared values and ideals. Those shared values are under attack on multiple fronts. Russia’s undeclared war against Ukraine is perhaps the most immediate example but it is by no means the only one. Resurgent nationalism and illiberal democracy are on the rise within Europe, at its borders and around the globe. Soros does acknowledge one factor that would justify independence, and that is if the U.K. decides to leave the E.U. in 2017: Only if Britain fails to resolve its differences with the EU, and if the pro-European Scots (having voted to remain within the UK) thus find themselves unwillingly excluded from Europe in 2017, would there be just cause for Scots to call for a new referendum. If it comes to that, Scotland will be in a different position – one that could legitimise a split. But to vote for independence from the UK now would be to prematurely surrender Scottish leverage in London, and Britain’s leverage in the world.  Read the full piece here &gt;&gt; FREE AppDownload
APFashion behemoth H&amp;M is the world's second largest clothing retailer by sales (behind Indetex, parent company of Zara). The chain, which has more than 3,000 stores in 53 countries, is known globally for designing and executing runway fashions quickly at a cheap price. It was founded in 1947 and by the late 1990s "had earned a reputation for regularly beating expectations and seemed unstoppable in its expansion," Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a recent research note. The analysts dug into H&amp;M's financials to illustrate just how successful the company has been over the last several decades. Here are some of the most interesting graphs from their report.  First, here's a look at the growth in H&amp;M's sales, which topped SEK 150 billion ($21 billion) last year.  Morgan Stanley U.S. sales have doubled just in the last five years. Morgan Stanley As sales have grown, so have the number of stores. There are now 3,132 H&amp;M stores in 53 countries. But 54% of the chain's sales come from just six countries: Germany, France, the UK, the US, Sweden and China, according to the report. Morgan Stanley"H&amp;M’s strong earnings record has driven strong, long-term share price performance," the analysts wrote. As the graph below illustrates, since January 1982, H&amp;M’s shares have outperformed the Stockholm share price index by more than 2,800%. Morgan StanleyProfits have also been on a tear. Morgan StanleyMuch of H&amp;M's success has to do with its quick turnaround time on styles, which it achieves through a vast network of suppliers. The company has 100 designers, 400 product developers and 900 suppliers, according to analysts. The time it takes for a design to hit stores can be as short as two to three weeks in Europe, their research found.

REUTERS / Brendan McdermidA New York state pension fund has given Goldman Sachs Group Inc $2 billion to invest with outside managers, Goldman and the fund said in a statement on Wednesday, a first for a fund that has traditionally picked managers itself. Officials in charge of overseeing the $180.7 billion New York State Common Retirement Fund wanted to invest more in markets outside the U.S. and decided it was best to outsource the task to a company that had the skills and resources to put money to work quickly, staff in the New York comptroller's office said. In talks with fund officials over the past year, Goldman executives presented an analysis of the fund's allocations based on publicly available data and suggested areas it could improve, such as where to spend the risk budget and whether to be more active or passive in certain portfolios, said the comptroller staffers, who spoke on the condition they not be named. REUTERS/Lucas JacksonTraders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange shortly after the start of trading August 6, 2014. The deal with New York is not the first business Goldman has won with a state pension fund, but it is the largest. Those analytics, combined with the size of Goldman's fund selection and due diligence team and a competitive pricing structure led the comptroller's office to partner with the bank. The partnership is the latest step in Goldman's effort to grow its investment management business, as new regulations and lower trading volume have pressured profits in other businesses the bank has traditionally relied on for growth. The office of New York State Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli is in talks with other potential partners to ink similar deals, staff said. Under the agreement with Goldman, the bank's Alternative Investments and Manager Selection (AIMS) Group will select managers for $2 billion worth of the pension fund's stock portfolio that focuses on making investments abroad with active managers. The fund is also in talks with Goldman about so-called "sustainable investments," which focus on environmentally friendly or socially responsible companies. The deal with New York is not the first business Goldman has won with a state pension fund but it is the largest. In 2008, South Carolina Retirement Systems entered a $1.5 billion partnership with the bank's investment management unit and in 2010, the Alaska Permanent Fund awarded it over $500 million. AIMS, which had $156 billion in assets under supervision at June 30, is an "open architecture" platform, which means none of the investments Goldman selects can be invested in funds that the bank's own portfolio managers oversee. Goldman and the pension fund declined to comment on fees.   (Reporting by Lauren Tara LaCapra; Editing by Bernard Orr) FREE AppDownload
APThe House of Representatives on Wednesday abruptly postponed a vote on a must-pass spending bill after a last-minute request from the White House to include a provision authorizing the administration to train and arm moderate factions of rebels in Syria. Kevin McCarthy announced on the House floor Wednesday afternoon that the House would no longer consider the continuing resolution on Thursday. The resolution must be passed by Sept. 30 to keep the government from shutting down. As part of President Barack Obama's plan to confront the group calling itself the Islamic State (also ISIS or ISIL), the administration is requesting that Congress include so-called "Title 10" authority under the U.S. code. It would allow the U.S. to ramp up assistance to moderate groups fighting both ISIS and the regime of Bashar Assad in the three-year Syrian civil war. The administration is on a full-court press with members of Congress on Wednesday. A senior administration official said both Obama and Vice President Joe Biden were making calls to members, and counterterrorism adviser Lisa Monaco is on Capitol Hill to meet with lawmakers. The administration believes its request needs to be tackled now and that the continuing resolution is the best mechanism by which to complete it. House Appropriations Committee Chair Hal Rogers (R-Kentucky), whose committee the spending bill runs through, told reporters he'd received a call from Obama on Tuesday evening. He said he personally thought it should be voted on separately from the continuing resolution. It's not yet clear if such a request from Obama could pass through either the House or Senate, given the bipartisan concern that any arms provided to moderate rebels could fall into the wrong hands. AP/J. Scott Applewhite Majority Leader Harry Reid wants Congress to pass Obama's request.Democratic leaders in Congress expressed support for granting the Title 10 authority. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Wednesday he believes Congress should give Obama the authority. "The president has tried to get that from us and we should give it to him," Reid said Wednesday on the Senate floor. "That is one way of helping build an international coalition. Congress should do it." Obama told congressional leaders in a meeting at the White House on Tuesday that he has the authority he needs to take action against ISIS, but said he would welcome any congressional steps that would "aid the overall effort and demonstrate to the world that the United States is united in defeating the threat."

Deutsche Bank But it wasn't always the largest. And it's unlikely to remain the largest economy for much longer. The chart above comes to us via Deutsche Bank's Jim Reid. "As Alexander, Rome and Britain fell from their positions of absolute global dominance, so too has the US begun to slip," Reid writes in a new note to clients. "America’s global economic dominance has been declining since 1998, well before the Global Financial Crisis. A large part of this decline has actually had little to do with the actions of the US but rather with the unraveling of a century’s long economic anomaly. China has begun to return to the position in the global economy it occupied for millennia before the industrial revolution." One look at the chart and it's pretty clear that it may not be very long before we start saying the U.S. is No. 2. "Based on current trends China’s economy will overtake America’s in purchasing power terms within the next few years," Reid continued. "The US is now no longer the world’s sole economic superpower and indeed its share of world output (on a PPP basis) has slipped below the 20% level which we have seen was a useful sign historically of a single dominant economic superpower. In economic terms we already live in a bi-polar world. Between them the US and China today control over a third of world output (on a PPP basis)." Reid offered this prescient quote from Napoleon Bonaparte: "Let China sleep, for when she awakes, she will shake the world."    FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Denis BalibouseA far cry from Apple's Watch.Apple has officially unveiled its long-awaited Watch, and while some in the tech and fashion industries are praising the latest gadget, don’t expect it to take over the traditional watch market anytime soon. Watches have been around for more than 500 years, surviving wars and technological revolutions. We may have advanced past the mechanics of the classic wristwatch, but we're still a long way from trading our Rolexes for smartwatches. "The Apple Watch ... won't have a dramatic impact on the Swiss watch market at this stage, as the majority of the market is composed of brands at a luxury level, David Sadigh, founder and CEO of the Digital Luxury Group, told Business Insider. "Folks at Vacheron Constantin, Rolex, and Patek Philippe can still sleep well at night." Here's why we aren't concerned about the fate of classic watches. Although the Watch wasn’t what some in the tech community were expecting, Apple no doubt attempted to appeal to watch purists, the fashion world, and the general public with familiar dials and watch faces (fashion editors were even invited to attend the Apple keynote for the first time).Business InsiderApple’s Watch is designed to be recognizable as a wristwatch. It's shaped like a traditional timepiece with a square clock face and even a digital crown on the side that can be spun and twisted to control what appears on the touch screen. Yet the gadget looks first generation, to put it mildly. Clunky and thick, the Watch tries too hard to look analogue, and not hard enough to look like the new-age smartwatch Apple fans were anticipating. Aside from its appearance, another concern is the battery life.  The Watch must be charged each night, which means you can't sleep with it on your wrist, as Business Insider's Jim Edwards points out. What the Apple Watch does have going for it is customization. Don’t like your watch face? Tap for a new one. Can’t decide between a leather wrist band or sporty fluoroelastomer band? Get both. This is by far the most customizable product Apple has ever introduced. Another pro is how sporty the Watch is. It can provide plenty of data for fitness enthusiasts and will compete with the FitBit and Nike FuelBand, as well as wearable devices from tech industry rivals. But the Apple Watch is still not handsome or long-wearing enough to compete with real watches. Mechanical watches have remained popular through the digital age because of their craftsmanship and superior quality. "We're all extremely attached to our cameras, our phones, our computers, our iPads, and I think there's something charming about owning something analogue," Stephen Pulvirent, former associate editor of online watch publication HODINKEE, told Business Insider last year. "I'm going to replace my iPhone sometime in the next few years. But a really high-quality watch I can wear and enjoy on a daily basis.”  REUTERS/Hans DerykIt may not be able to ready you heart rate, but classic watches can last for decades.Watch buyers accept that they're paying tens of thousands of dollars for what went into making their watch because they expect it to last. It takes master watchmakers months and sometimes years to create the elaborate interior mechanisms that make collectors' watches so special, such as a split-second chronograph (two second hands to time different events) and perpetual calendars (which are designed to display the correct date on any given day in the future). And never underestimate the power of history and nostalgia. Watch brands recognize that even if people aren't necessarily wearing watches to tell time, the watch can still be a symbol of something more personal.  "I can give my watch to my children and they can give it to one of their children," Pulvirent said. "It's something that works in perpetuity since watches aren't something that needs to be changed constantly."  On the other hand, if you buy an Apple Watch when it's released next year, it will quickly become obsolete once the next generation of the product is released. Apple announced that the watch will be available beginning in 2015, with a base price of $349.  At that price, the Watch only competes with a small segment of the market. “While the new Apple Watch won’t replace the inherent beauty and elegant utility of a vintage Patek Phillippe, it will disrupt the low-end market for overpriced quartz wristwatches (and maybe even some mechanical watches),” writes Kelly Jasper at HODINKEE. High-end Swiss watchmakers shouldn't blink an eye at the Watch, but it could compete with mass-market watch brands like Rado, Citizen, and Fossil, which sell timepieces at similar price points. And while Swiss watchmakers now export more than $20 billion worth of watches, growth within the segment has been uneven, Pulvirent, now at Bloomberg Businessweek, writes, noting: Dollar and unit exports of battery-powered electronic watches have been flat, while the market for luxury mechanical watches has nearly quadrupled. In 2000, mechanical watches accounted for only 8 percent of the watches leaving Switzerland; in 2013 they represented 27 percent. Nearly all this growth is coming from watches priced over 3,000 francs. Global consumer interest in luxury watches grew 5.7% worldwide in 2013, with China, India, and Russia experiencing the biggest year-over-year increases. And the market for vintage luxury watches remains strong as well.WorldWatchReport   Apple is equipped to handle these challenges down the line. The Watch's design can be made more streamlined, and the battery life can be improved as technology advances. Designers and celebrities may also start to team up with Apple to make more fashionable versions of the Watch (à la Google Glass and Diane von Furstenberg), giving it more clout and desirability in the marketplace. The Apple Watch is just the newest player in the game though, and there will always be people who want impeccably made watches that last for decades (and don’t need to be charged every night, or used exclusively with an iPhone).  The classic wrist watch has lasted this long, and it isn't going anywhere.  FREE AppDownload

Screenshot/PocketnowA sapphire display — like the kind not used in the latest iPhone. There are sapphire displays for Apple Watch, which is set to be released in early 2015, and the camera lens on the new iPhone. However, the main front display was not sapphire, as had been hoped. The steep drop in shares of GT Advanced, however, came after reports ahead of the iPhone announcement that iPhone 6 wouldn't feature a sapphire display. Additionally, GT Advanced and Apple announced in November 2013 that the company and Apple signed a five-year sapphire materials agreement.  But it seems that investors were still holding out hope that Apple would surprise and announce a full sapphire display.  This is what the disappointment looks like, in chart form.

REUTERS/Suzanne PlunkettBagpiper and busker David Whitney of Aberdeen, Scotland, plays the bagpipes near Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament in central London September 10, 2014.Stocks were higher on Wednesday during a quiet session that saw little in the way of economic data as the tech-heavy Nasdaq rallied as Apple gained following its huge product announcement on Tuesday. First, the scoreboard: And now, the top stories on Wednesday: 1. On Wednesday morning, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced that wholesale inventories rose 0.1% month-over-month in July, less than the 0.5% increase that was expected. In June, wholesale inventories rose 0.2%  2. The next FOMC meeting is now just one week away, and on Wednesday the Kansas City Fed released its latest Labor Market Conditions Indicators report, which showed that labor market activity remains near historically high levels. Following the report, Chris Rupkey at MUFG Union Bank said the report shows that, "Net net, the labor market is moving closer to the full employment finish line with today’s improvement in the Kansas City Fed’s Labor Market Conditions Indicators. Good news for the economy." 3. On Tuesday, Apple announced its much anticipated iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, but the announcement was a disappointment for GT Advanced Technologies. GT Advanced makes scratch-resistant sapphire displays, which were not featured on the front of the newest iPhone models, but will be featured on Apple Watch, which is set for release in early 2015. GT Advanced shares fell by more than 12% on Tuesday following the news, and lost another 14% on Wednesday.  4. Twitter shares gained 4.5% after analysts at UBS upgraded the stock to Buy from Neutral, citing improving trends in the online digital advertising market. UBS analyst Eric Sheridan and his team also raised their profit and revenue outlooks for Twitter through 2018, with the firm expecting Twitter's revenue to be more than $6.2 billion by the end of that year. 5. Shares of Chinese internet data company 21Vianet were down as much as 30% at one point on Wednesday after independent research firm Trinity Research called the company a Ponzi scheme in a new research report. 21Vianet shares finished Wednesday's session down 8%.  6. RadioShack shares were down more than 10% for most of the day on Wednesday after analysts at Wedbush cut their price target on the struggling electronics retailer to $0. "Our price target reflects our expectation that creditors will force a reorganization and wipe out RadioShack's equity," Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter wrote in a note. Shares of the company finished down just 1% after an aggressive rally into the market close. 7. Apple shares gained nearly 3% on Wednesday, the first full day of trading after the company announced two new iPhones, a new mobile payment system, and Apple Watch. 8. A week from Thursday, voters in Scotland are set to take to the polls to vote on independence from U.K., and BI's Joe Weisenthal highlighted one paragraph you need to read if you're in favor of Scottish independence. Analysts at Credit Suisse wrote: "Risk of an economic crisis: In our opinion Scotland would fall into a deep recession."

Business Insider / Apple KeynoteThe Wall Street banks partnering with Apple Inc. on its new mobile payment system, including JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Bank of America Corp, are betting the deal will lower fraud costs and expand the budding mobile-payment market, offering banks more opportunity to cash in on transactions, according to analysts familiar with the matter. Apple announced the new service, called Apple Pay, on Tuesday. Under deals reached with at least nine major banks as well as Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc. and American Express Co., Apple will collect a fee from banks each time shoppers wave an iPhone 6 or 6 Plus or Apple Watch instead of swiping credit or debit cards or entering credit or debit numbers online, Bloomberg reported. Business InsiderAccording to Bloomberg, Apple will collect a fee every time Apple Pay is used instead of a card.The top bank issuers, including Citigroup Inc. and Wells Fargo &amp; Co., represent 83 percent of credit-card volume, Apple said. “The benefit for the issuers is it allows them to maintain their brand relevance, whether customers use a physical card or smartphone, and it potentially lowers fraud costs,” said Josh Beck, equity research analyst at Pacific Crest Securities. Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Bernstein, said in a note Wednesday that his firm believes Apple's commission or toll to banks for providing the service "could be minimal ... pointing to potential [annual] revenues in the hundreds of millions, not billions." He also said Apple has not confirmed that it will charge banks a fee. In a typical credit-card transaction, banks collect about 2 percent of the purchase from the merchant because they assume the risk on the payment. Those revenues help banks fund fraud costs and reward programs. In the deal with Apple, though details remain unclear, Apple is assuming some of the risk, lowering costs for banks, though banks have agreed to pay Apple some percentage of the transactions, said BMO Capital analyst Paul Condra. REUTERS/Brendan McDermidWall Street banks partnering with Apple on its new mobile payment system are betting the deal will lower fraud costs and expand the budding mobile-payment market.When a customer uses his or her iPhone to pay, Apple uses credit card information stored on the phone in a special chip but never sent to Apple servers or the retailer, the company claims, which would make the payments less susceptible to fraud and hacking. Instead, the smartphone generates a proxy number for the retailer and protects each transaction with a unique code. The payment even requires fingerprint authentication, preventing phone thieves from using a stolen Apple Pay account. Banks also want the mobile payment market to expand because that would mean more potential customers and revenues on transactions. The mobile payment system will be worth about $90 billion by 2017, according to Forrester Research. “If you’re paying with a wallet, cash is always an option,” Beck said. “If you’re pulling out your phone, the only option is digital payments, which offers more opportunity for revenue on transactions.” Apple Pay is expected to launch in the U.S. in October at more than 220,000 stores, including Target Corp., Macy’s Inc. and Walgreen Co., and JPMorgan is expected to unveil its own mobile wallet in the next few months.  FREE AppDownload
We recently looked at the most affluent towns in every U.S. state. Now we're turning our attention to educational achievement. The American Community Survey is an annual survey run by the Census Bureau to allow the government, corporate and academic researchers, and anyone who is curious about demographics to better understand the population of the U.S. Among many other subjects, the ACS includes questions about respondents' education levels. Using the 2008-2012 ACS estimates for places with at least 1,000 population, Business Insider made a map showing, for each state, the town with the highest percentage of adults over 25 who have at least a bachelor's degree: Business Insider/Andy Kiersz, data from 2008-2012 American Community Survey As with the affluent places, a good number of the most educated towns are suburbs of big cities. Many towns showed up on both maps, having both very high median incomes and educational attainment, like Scarsdale, New York, and Chevy Chase, Maryland. Some are college towns, like University Heights, Iowa, and Wellesley, Massachusetts. Indeed, for four states — California, Mississippi, New York, and Pennsylvania — the highest-ranking place was actually a college campus. Since we're focusing on towns, we removed the college campuses from our list. There was a bit more of a population spread for the best-educated places than for the most affluent. Populations ranged from a little over 1,000 (our chosen lower cutoff) in Yarrow Point, Washington, all the way up to Fargo, North Dakota, a city of 106,000.  Here are the 50 towns: Business Insider/Andy Kiersz, data from 2008-2012 American Community Survey   
AP / Lauren Victoria BurkeTony West stands next to Attorney General Eric Holder as he announces a settlement with Bank of American reached in August. West is adamant that more settlements and prosecutions are to come. Tony West, the third-ranking official at the U.S. Department of Justice, has a ready response for critics who question why few individuals have been charged for conduct tied to the financial crisis: just wait. "We are not done, we are not finished," said West, who was responsible for crafting a series of multi-billion dollar civil settlements with top banks JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Bank of America over shoddy mortgage bonds they sold in the run up to the 2008 crisis. Those three settlements, each of which beat a record amount set by the prior one, did not include charges against any individuals at the banks. "Simply because we have been successful in using particular tools doesn't mean that we have made any determinations about not using other tools," West, who is leaving the agency next week, said in an interview in his 5th floor conference room at DOJ headquarters. He did not provide details about any additional actions the Justice Department may take against the banks or individuals. Associated PressTony West says "We are not done, we are not finished." West was responsible for crafting a series of multi-billion dollar civil settlements with top banks JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Bank of America. After spending more than five years at the Justice Department, including three years as head of the civil division, West leaves behind a legacy of nearly $37 billion in settlements that won him praise as a master negotiator who forced substantial penalties on banks that contributed to the crisis. But his work on the settlements also raised questions across the political spectrum about why individuals did not face related charges and how the penalties were calculated. Bank lawyers privately complained there was little explanation of why the government sought the numbers it did. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, this week again hammered financial regulators for not referring more potentially criminal cases, and slammed the Justice Department's settlements. REUTERS/Joshua RobertsSenator Elizabeth Warren has made her name in being tough on Wall Street. Warren is adamant that individuals need to be prosecuted over the financial collapse."No corporation can break the law unless an individual within that corporation broke the law," she said at a Senate Banking Committee hearing on Tuesday. "Yet, despite the misconduct at these banks that generated tens of billions of dollars in settlement payments by the companies, not a single senior executive at these banks has been criminally prosecuted." West, in the interview, defended the settlements, pointing out that the government could not have obtained the consumer relief included in the settlements if it had gone to court and litigated the cases. He also said that no bank asked for a detailed explanation of the calculation of the penalties to be included in settlement documents. Further, West said the Justice Department's approach to penalties has been generally affirmed by U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff, an outspoken critic of light enforcement actions involving Wall Street. In July, as Bank of America was in negotiations with West's team, Rakoff separately ordered the bank to pay a $1.27 billion penalty for fraud over shoddy mortgages sold by the former Countrywide Financial Corp, which Bank of America bought during the crisis. It gave credence to the government's theories of penalties the banks were being forced to pay under the law at issue, FIRREA. "Judge Rakoff is, as everybody knows, an incredibly brilliant judge, and the fact that he saw it in very similar ways as we saw it, certainly makes you feel like you are on the right track," West said. West, who previously mounted unsuccessful bids for local office in his home state of California, said he would not rule out a return to government. "I hope I'll have the opportunity at some point in the future to have the chance to serve the public again in some way," he said. He declined to comment on his next plans, but Bloomberg reported late Tuesday that West is expected to join PepsiCo Inc. as its new general counsel. Spokesmen for the Justice Department and for Pepsi declined comment.   (Reporting by Aruna Viswanatha, with additional reporting by Anjali Athavaley; Editing by Kare Van Hall and Chizu Nomiyama) FREE AppDownload
Mario Tama/Getty ImagesThe market is perpetually in some state of irrationality that no one can explain.Imagine you're a weather forecaster. For the last four years, you've predicted a massive blizzard and frigid temperatures. But it never came. It's actually been downright hot for the four years straight. Ninety degrees and sunny every day. Now imagine you resign from the meteorology business because you are sick and tired — sick and tired — of atmospheric pressure. "All of my forecasting models tell me it should be snowing," you say. "But like some spoiled brat, atmospheric pressure waltzes in here like he owns the place, keeping it hot day after day. This pressure has no business being in the sky. It's appalling how much gall the atmosphere has." This would, of course, be ridiculous. Your viewers would tell you that the weather is always right, and you, as a forecaster, are the one who is wrong. It doesn't matter if it's abnormally hot. Your job as a forecaster was to predict that it would be abnormally hot. That's why they pay you to be a forecaster. Finance is different. Unlike all other fields, finance people get to blame their poor forecasting skills on reality. Hedge fund Rinehart Capital Partners LLC announced it was closing last week. It's easy to see why. According to The Wall Street Journal, the fund lost 7% in 2012, another 15% in 2013, and is down 4% this year. The S&amp;P 500 gained 68.2% during this period. Reinhart founder Andrew Cunagin wrote a letter to investors announcing the closure. He explained his poor performance by blaming high-frequency traders, the Fed, and a market that went higher when he doesn't think it should have: Just as in previous boom-bust cycles, the seeds of destruction are sewn in the illusion of trend masquerading as truth, with momentum seeming to validate a widening gap between perception and economic reality. And just as in past cycles, the manager who doesn't subscribe to the new rules, who goes against the grain of convention is viewed as out of touch or left behind ... Since the beginning of our fund's drawdown in early 2012, a Bloomberg index of the "Worst Balance Sheet" companies of the S&amp;P500 has returned to-date over +30% on an annualized basis. An MSCI index of the "Most-Shorted" companies of the Russell 3000 — a proxy for the visibility of bad valuations, bad managements, and bad fundamentals — has also returned over +30% annualized. These perversions are even more pronounced within EMs, exacerbated by record fund outflows in the first half of 2014, exceeding even those of the 2008 crisis. This dash for trash puts to shame even the speculative excesses of the dot.com era. This is a circus market rigged by HFT and other algorithmic traders who prey on the rational behavior of warm-blooded investors. They only serve to further undermine the integrity of public markets, which will ultimately bring about their rationalization. Nonetheless, it's an internal dynamic to which we are uniquely levered, by design, as an alpha strategy. One thing is certain, managers whose strategies are working may be bright and well-informed with advanced metrics on which they make investment decisions, but a reasonable assessment of value is not among them. Do previous cycles not bear asking, what other measure is there? Look, stocks have gone up a lot. Some sketchy companies are expensive by any definition. But the entire history of the stock market is a pendulum swinging from absurdity to absurdity. There is no such thing as a normal, healthy market. It's perpetually in some state of irrationality that no one can explain. You should never blame an irrational market for your terrible performance. The market is always right, even if you disagree with it. It's your strategy that got it wrong. And "wrong" is the right word to use here because your actions dragged performance down so far that you're being forced to close, forfeiting any chance of vindication. "The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent," John Maynard Keynes famously said. What bugs me about this is incentives. When hedge fund managers get it right, they earn multi-million, even billion-dollar paydays, and are paraded around as living gods. When they get it wrong, it's someone else's fault. The Fed is irresponsible, the president is ruining the economy, high-frequency traders are destroying confidence, Congress is creating uncertainty, yadda yadda yadda. Rarely is anyone in finance forced to admit what the weatherman would have to: I was wrong.  FREE AppDownload

Wikimedia CommonsWILMINGTON Del (Reuters) - Trump Entertainment Resorts received U.S. Bankruptcy Court approval on Wednesday for an agreement that gives it 30 days to craft a cost-cutting turnaround plan to save its Taj Mahal casino-hotel from liquidation. A lawyer for Trump Entertainment said after the hearing in Wilmington, Delaware, that the company could present a plan to end operations. "It could be a liquidating plan, but we hope not," said Kristopher Hansen, an attorney with Stroock &amp; Stroock &amp; Lavan who represents Trump Entertainment. The company plans to close the smaller of its two casinos, the Trump Plaza, next week. It will become the fourth casino-hotel to close in the New Jersey seaside resort this year. Gaming revenues in Atlantic City have fallen by about half over the past eight years as neighboring states legalized slot machines and table games. Earlier this month the city was hit by the closures of the Showboat and the striking, two-year-old Revel casino hotel, a $2.4 billion complex that many hoped would rejuvenate Atlantic City. Hansen said hopes that the closures would boost Trump Entertainment's business by removing competition were misplaced and gambling revenues had fallen 25 percent since the Revel shut its doors. "We have been seeing accelerating losses," he told Delaware Bankruptcy Judge Kevin Gross in Wilmington, Delaware. Hansen told Gross that the company could not find financing to help keep it operating in bankruptcy, leaving the company dependent on billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who has liens on the company's cash. Icahn consented to giving the company 30 days to present a plan of reorganization. The plan must be confirmed by Gross in 105 days, or late November. Icahn is owed about $286 million. "If in fact we need to shut the Taj Mahal we will pursue an orderly wind-down of these cases thereafter," Hansen said. The company said it spends about $20 million a year on pension and other labor costs, which Hansen said was unsustainable in the current gambling market. He said Trump Entertainment also needed to cut its debt payments, which total $38 million annually. The casino emerged from its last bankruptcy in 2010, with a plan backed by Marc Lasry's Avenue Capital Management investment funds. Real estate developer-turned-reality TV star Donald Trump held a minority stake. Icahn at the time ridiculed the Lasry-Trump plan as a "farce" that would land the company back in bankruptcy by starving it of capital. Trump sued the company bearing his name in August to have his named removed, saying the properties were so poorly maintained they would tarnish his image. The latest filing marks the fifth bankruptcy related to these casinos, according to Fitch, a credit rating agency.

The stock fell as much as 20 percent to 76 cents on Wednesday, adding to a 23 percent plunge on Tuesday. "Our price target reflects our expectation that creditors will force a reorganization and wipe out RadioShack's equity," Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter wrote in a note. Pachter, rated four stars out of five by StarMine for the accuracy of his calls on RadioShack, is the second top rated analyst to cut the stock's price target to $0 this year. RadioShack's stores, which have been around for more than 90 years, were once the go-to shops for budding innovators and engineers for products that ranged from vacuum tube speakers to the first mass-produced PC, the TRS-80. But the retailer has not done enough to transform itself into a destination for mobile phone buyers, losing out to rivals such Amazon.com Inc and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. It reported its ninth straight quarterly loss in June and is burning through cash as it struggles to sustain its turnaround efforts, which have so far failed to bear fruit. Pachter, who previously had a price target of $1, said he was lowering the target as declining sales of consumer electronics and falling margins were likely to force the company to seek bankruptcy protection to turn around its business. RadioShack attempted to close 1,100 stores this year, but lenders did not agree with the plans, forcing it curb the closings to 200 stores a year. Pachter has an "underperform" rating on the stock. The stock has fallen from a high of $78 at the peak of the dotcom boom to 76 cents as of Wednesday. Of the 13 analysts covering the company, seven have a "sell" recommendation on the stock, while the rest have a "hold" rating, according to Thomson Reuters data.   (Reporting by Ramkumar Iyer in Bangalore; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty) FREE AppDownload
Scott Olson/Getty ImagesIs economic growth slowing once again? BlackRock's Russ Koesterich doesn't think so.Following five years of an uneven, disappointing and often erratic recovery, investors can be forgiven for a certain level of paranoia when it comes to economic growth. Each year is forecasted to be the one when the global economy finally “breaks out” of historically low growth levels. Instead, for much of the past five years, gross domestic product (GDP) growth figures in Europe, the United States and even emerging markets have consistently come up short. Despite some recent positive surprises in the United States, this trend has generally continued in 2014, leaving many investors asking the question: Is economic growth once again slowing? I believe the answer is no. To be sure, global growth will be below trend once again this year and long-term growth is likely to remain lower than the post-World War II average going forward. However, I see few signs of a cyclical slowdown and related decelerating growth, outside of Europe and a few select emerging markets: Consider the following: The global Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) has been stable at around 52.5 for most of the year. This level is consistent with a modest expansion. Meanwhile, the services component of the global PMI actually improved recently. July’s reading of 56 represents a significant jump from the first half of the year. Credit market conditions have historically been a good sign post for the global economy. Deteriorating credit conditions, measured by widening spreads, have generally been associated with slower growth, while tight spreads tend to coincide with faster growth. Today, most measures of credit conditions are positive, with tight spreads across all of fixed income. Even high yield spreads have come in after a short scare last month. While gold prices have been selling off, prices of industrial metals have been more stable. This is relevant for global growth. Given industrial commodities’ sensitivity to economic activity, increases in their prices tend to have a positive correlation with global growth. Using the Journal of Commerce Index of Industrial Metals as a proxy, industrial metal prices have been holding their own. The index is up around 8% from the spring lows and 7% year over year. On this metric, there is little evidence of a global slowdown. In short, while there are parts of the global economy that investors should be nervous about, on a global basis the economy appears stable. What is noticeable is a growing divergence between different regions and countries. The United States is accelerating, while Europe is struggling — growth there was flat in the second quarter. In emerging markets, China seems to be achieving a soft landing and Indian growth has picked up, but Brazil slipped back into recession during the first half of the year. The bottom line: The major trend in the global economy is one of increasing divergence, rather than slower growth. FREE AppDownload
Lane Hickenbottom/ReutersWe don't hear a lot from Warren Buffett's partner at Berkshire Hathaway, Charlie Munger, but when we do it's always colorful. Wednesday the 90 year-old investor's words were directed at accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young, the auditor of his company, publisher Daily Journal Corp. Bloomberg reports that Munger dismissed their work with one succinct comparison. “They were like the doctor who wanted to cure the nosebleed by fishing around in the groin,” he said Wednesday at the Daily Journal's annual meeting. Ernst &amp; Young said there were issues with the  accounting for acquisitions and deferred tax provisions. Apparently Munger disagreed. Because of issues with financial reporting, the company's annual report for the year ending Sept. 30 wasn't released until June 24. In the midst of all that, Daily Journal replaced Ernst &amp; Young with BDO. So it seems Munger won't be prodded any more. FREE AppDownload
Bloomberg The pound is surging after the latest poll on the Scottish independence vote from Survation showed the pro-union camp 6% ahead. The news is being greeted warmly by markets that have been bombarded with scare stories of what could happen if Scotland elected to break away from the U.K. on Sept. 18. The Survation poll of 1,000 voters showed the No vote holding its lead at 53% ahead of the 47% in favor of independence.  The results, which come after two polls from earlier this week showed the Scottish independence movement leading, should be a promising sign for the Better Together campaign.  FREE AppDownload
APAbercrombie & Fitch CEO Mike JeffriesAbercrombie &amp; Fitch's decision to stop printing logos on its clothes as a way to rebrand itself is a complete departure from CEO Mike Jeffries' entire company philosophy. Jeffries became CEO in 1992, when Abercombie's sales were languishing. He turned the brand into a retail powerhouse by plastering the Abercrombie logo all over its offerings, focusing on a more preppy, casual aesthetic, and then sexing it up with racy advertising and selling it at steep prices. His strategy was aimed at the "cool kids... the attractive all-American kid with a great attitude and a lot of friends," Jeffries told Salon in a 2006 interview. He made Abercrombie seem like an exclusive club that bestowed its logo on thin, tan, popular teens with lots of cash to spend. The advertising, which featured frolicking, half-naked co-eds, upset many parents — but that made the brand even more attractive to their kids.   GettyAn Abercrombie & Fitch store display in 2003"A lot of people don’t belong [in our clothes], and they can’t belong," Jeffries famously said in the Salon interview. "Are we exclusionary? Absolutely." Jeffries' strategy worked. It turned Abercrombie into a status symbol that nearly every teenager in America sought to attain, and sales nearly doubled within Jeffries' first two years with the company to $165 million. By 1999, sales topped $1 billion. "In schools across America, Abercrombie is shorthand for popular," Time Magazine wrote in 2000. That year, it was the top-ranked clothing brand according to a national teen survey, and it was eulogized in the rap song "Summer Girls" by LFO with the lyrics, "When I met you I said my name was Rich/You look like a girl from Abercrombie Fitch." GettyMike Jeffries turned Abercrombie into a status symbol.But over time, the brand has lost its luster.  "The logo is no longer cool, unless you are a middle schooler in a rural middle school," Erik Gordon, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan’s business school told Business Insider. Cash-strapped teens have grown tired of wearing logos and they are opting for cheaper brands such as Forever 21 and H&amp;M. "Half the time I don’t really buy any brands," Olivia D’Amico, a 16-year-old from New York, told The New York Times in a recent interview. "I just bought a pair of fake Doc Martens because I don’t really care." Abercrombie has also been hit by a major shift in teen consumption. Young people are now spending more on restaurants than clothes and they aren't visiting the mall as much as previous generations did. Teen mall visits have dropped 30% in the last decade, according to according to Piper Jaffray's semiannual survey of teens' shopping habits. And when teens do spend on clothes, they aren't shopping at Abercrombie. The company ranks second on a list of brands that teens no longer wear, according to Piper Jaffray's survey. Piper Jaffray But until recently, Jeffries has refused to admit that the Abercrombie logo no longer defines "cool" for young teens in America, and the company has suffered as a result. Abercrombie's same-store sales have fallen for 10 straight quarters. As a whole in fiscal 2013, same-store sales fell 10%. Jeffries still proudly wears the Abercrombie logo, however, and strongly encourages corporate employees to do the same.  "There’s this fetishistic attitude — you want to demonstrate as much allegiance to the brand as possible because that’s what makes Mike happy," a former designer told New York Magazine. Just last November, the company assured analysts that it would not be dropping logos from its clothes.  APAbercrombie & Fitch clothes on display in 2003"We cannot walk away from the logo business," Leslee K. Herro, Abercrombie's executive vice president of planning and allocation, said during a Nov. 6 meeting with analysts.  On an earnings call a couple weeks later, Jeffries suggested that he could make logos "cool" again.  "I think that it's very smart that there is a logo business that is ongoing," Jeffries said. "Our mission in logo is to make that category cooler." A couple months later, Jeffries was stripped of his role as chairman of the company's board.  "Last November, Jeffries was feeling more powerful than he is today," Gordon, the University of Michigan professor, said. "He could dictate what [Abercrombie &amp; Fitch] did. Today, he is wiggling to keep his job." Jeffries is now changing his tune entirely. While logos will remain part of the strategy overseas, the company is dropping them almost entirely from inventory in North America.  "In the spring season we are looking to take the North American logo business to practically nothing," Jeffries said on an earnings call last month.  Two decades after making Abercrombie &amp; Fitch synonymous with cool, Jeffries is finally letting go of the past.

 After 40 years on Wall Street you rack up some wins and some losses. In an interview with Skiddy von Stade, CEO of finance career site OneWire, Mark Patterson — co-founder of distressed debt private equity firm MatlinPatterson — is candid about both. It's a rare thing. MatlinPatterson started as the Global Distressed Securities Group at Credit Suisse in 1994. In 2002 the firm was spun out. Patterson explains, “[Our firm] was independently spun out with a letter to all the LPs allowing them to walk away from the fund if they didn’t want to stay. Six million out of 2.2 billion chose to walk…Everybody stayed.” They stayed for the good — like taking 1-800 Flowers public — and the bad. It is his insight into that latter that makes Patterson's interview especially worth a watch. For example, there was the time MatlinPatterson started investing in an automotive parts company from 2002 to 2004. "If you think that GM and Ford and Chrysler are going to be fair to you as a couple hundred million or a billion dollar supplier, you're an idiot," said Patterson. "They're going to bully you. They're going to crush you. Compassion is not what led them to be giant companies and anybody weak got crushed." That's real talk.

REUTERS/Kevin LamarqueU.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen testifies before the Senate Banking Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington July 15, 2014.The Kansas City Fed just released an under-the-radar labor market report, and it looks pretty good. On Wednesday, the KC Fed released its latest Labor Market Conditions Indicators, a composite index comprised of 24 variables. In August, the report's activity indicator improved .08% from July, while the momentum indicator remains near historically high levels. This is what the index looks like since the financial crisis.  KC Fed Following the report, Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank, noted that the KC Fed's report is among the 19 labor market indicators that the Fed tracks. "Another day another Yellen dashboard indicator showing slack is receding," Rupkey wrote in an email.  Rupkey said the report shows that, "Net net, the labor market is moving closer to the full employment finish line with today’s improvement in the Kansas City Fed’s Labor Market Conditions Indicators. Good news for the economy." As Rupkey sees it, this report also implies that the Fed might be closer to rate hikes than some expect, writing, "At Jackson Hole, Yellen talked about their index combining 19 different labor market indicators. Well, it looks like it is improving, and this moves the Fed closer to the finish line, and rate hikes. Bet on it." Earlier on Wednesday, we highlighted this chart from DoubleLine's Jeff Gundlach that he argues shows why the Fed is in no hurry to raise interest rates. We're now just a week away from the Fed's next monetary policy announcement, which will be accompanied by a press conference from Fed Chair Janet Yellen as well as an updated summary of economic projections from the FOMC.

FlickrThe executive chairman of the Santander Bank, and one of Europe's most powerful men, Emilio Botin, unexpectedly died on Tuesday at the age of 79. This megastar banker took the small domestic Santander Bank and converted it into the Eurozone's largest bank. He also contributed in orchestrating exceptional Spanish growth during the 1990s.  Emilio Botin was born into a banking family in the small city of Santander known as a busy trading post on the northern Spanish coast. His family first took control of Banco Santander in 1909 when his grand-father Emilio I Botin became the bank's chairman. In 1950 Emilio II — Botin's father — assumed leadership over the bank, and Botin went to earn a degree in law and economics. Following his education, Botin joined the family business as a low-level manger. Not every member of the Botin family worked at Banco Santander, however. Botin's great-grandfather discovered Northern Spain's Altamira caves in 1879. And today, the Botin family is building an arts center in the northern corner of Santander. Flickr Within two years Botin was appointed to the bank's board, and seventeen years later — at the age of 43 — he became Santander's CEO. Under Botin's leadership, the Santander bank survived several financial problems. The 1970s saw a major banking crisis that lead to the closing of 57 banks, but Botin managed to keep Santander open. And in 1986 he succeeded his father as Santander's chairman. After its collapse in 1993, Santander's major rival bank — Banesto SA —was taken by the Spanish government. Within a year, Botin purchased Banesto at an auction. He continued to acquire various banks in Latin America and the United Kingdom, eventually growing Santander into one of the world's biggest banks. One of Botin's major plays involved an extremely complicated and swiftly executed deal. Santander bought the Italian bank Antonveneta in 2007 and promptly sold it within several days to its rival Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena. Banco Santander made a 50% profit on this deal, and avoided ownership of an Italian bank during the global financial crisis. Although Botin primarily focused on Latin American and UK acquisitions, in 2010 he directed Santander in a new direction with the purchase of the US retail bank Sovereign. Banco Santander saw a minor scandal in 2008 because some of the bank's clients had invested a total of € 2.33 billion with Bernie Madoff. Consequently, within the year Santander offered preferred shares paying 2% interest to private banking clients, hoping to mend the relationships with those clients. Flickr Emilio Botin was known as a "very much hands-on chairman, often scrutinizing  individual loans", even though Banco Santander was 98% owned by outsider investors. He counted presidents and royalty among his friends, and was nicknamed "El Presidente."  Forbes estimated his fortune at $1.7 billion in 2006. He was also known for his love of motor racing, and Santander had a "strong high-street presence" as a Formula 1 sponsor. Botin is survived by his 53-year old, Harvard educated daughter, Ana Botin. On Wednesday the bank appointed Ana Botin as his successor — a nepotistic decision that could spark some controversy. Following a 7-year stretch at JP Morgan, Ana Botin joined Santander's board at age 28. She was later the executive chairman of Bank Banesto (Santander's UK operation) for seven years until November 2010 when she was replaced by Antonio Horta-Osorio. FREE AppDownload
Reuters As hedge fund star Mike Novogratz of Fortress Investments said this spring — it's "so bad it's good." But what's more likely is that regime change after October's election is no cure-all. Latin America is a region where what often looks like change is more of the same. In this world, bad never has to be followed by good. Right now there are three candidates in the running: the incumbent, Dilma Rousseff, Marina Silva of the socialist party, and Aécio Neves, a social democrat. Silva, a former running mate of late presidential candidate Eduardo Campos who died in a plane crash last month, has inched above Rousseff in polls, but even if Silva wins, real change is hardly guaranteed. "It doesn't look that clean cut," economist Claudio Loser of Centennial Group Latin America told Business Insider. Silva "comes from the same place [as the current regime] — they have a very difficult road ahead." Cantor Fitzgerald put it even more succinctly in a recent note saying, "Our thought is that the Brazilian ‘election trade’ will eventually be sniffed out as the farce it clearly is. It does not take much sense of history to appreciate the irony that Ms. Silva is running a reform campaign against a leftist Workers Party candidate, who herself came in under a reform agenda president (Lula). Moreover, Ms. Silva was herself a Workers Party minister from 2003 to 2008 under Lula." Does that sound like change to you? Here's what Brazil faces right now — an unfortunate cocktail of inflation, a tight labor market, and slow growth. Morgan Stanley sees the country's GDP going negative in the first half of 2015, contracting -0.4%. Inflation has been worsened by the fact that over the years, wages in Brazil have risen at a steady clip and corporate profits have declined. Former shining stars of the Brazil's stock market, like state oil company Petrobras, have dimmed considerably. In the last five years Petrobras' stock has fallen almost 60%. It is also embroiled in a kickback scandal involving the current administration of President Dilma Rousseff and Silva's late running mate. "A few years ago I said this was the best run oil company in Latin America," said Loser, "but it has collapsed under the political pressure of the government. They're wasting a great opportunity in the way they're managing their oil resources. I'm not saying 'as goes Petrobras there goes Brazil' but it is very very important." The reforms Brazil needs to change course are no easy task for even the most brilliant political operators. Brazilians have come to expect a certain standard of living, and consumption makes up the largest portion of the country's economy at 63%. And it is consumption, precisely, that will be hit hardest by reforms. To combat inflation, the government must raise interest rates, tighten its fiscal policy, and allow prices to adjust (accelerating inflation before the situation normalizes). And while reforms could attract investment, that simply isn't enough to offset the pain of losing the power of the Brazilian consumer. Morgan Stanley said in a recent note that it believes "that by the second half of the year [2015] we would witness a rebound of investment-led growth, which would grow by 2.4%Y that year, but this would not be enough to compensate for the weakness in consumption." And that's a rosy scenario — one that would happen if reforms are implemented. Cantor predicts that a rate hike is unlikely. Period. The country has an ugly history with such hikes, and political tensions are running high after protests leading up to and during the World Cup. Brazil is delicate. "The volatility surface arguably indicates an expectation that a reform agenda may prevail (presupposing both that Silva wins and that it actually matters if she does)," Cantor said in its note. "Again, we say good luck with that." Indeed.    FREE AppDownload
APTwitter CEO Dick Costolo. Twitter shares were up more than 3% on Wednesday after analysts at UBS upgraded the stock to Buy from Neutral.  In a note to clients titled — you guessed it — #UpgradeToBuy, UBS analyst Eric Sheridan and his team took their rating on the social media company to Buy from Neutral while putting a $65 price target on the stock. UBS said positive momentum in the online digital advertising space will help Twitter, and the firm raised its revenue estimates for Twitter through 2018.  UBS now sees revenue totaling more than $6.2 billion 2018, up from previous expectations for about $5 billion.  Sheridan and his team write: "In particular, our advertising checks indicate Twitter is seeing positive momentum with objective-based campaigns (pay-for-performance campaign formats), and we believe the launch of Promoted Video ads, the introduction of the 'Buy Now' button, the international self-serve ad rollout (11 new countries), and the addition of TapCommerce to Twitter's ad tech stack (which brings additional demand to the MoPub exchange) all position Twitter strongly along key secular growth areas within digital advertising." UBS also raised its profit expectations for Twitter, as it sees revenue increasing without a huge increase in operating expenses.  Here's a full breakdown of UBS' new profit and revenue expectations for Twitter. UBS Since bottoming at $30.50 per share in May, Twitter shares have been on a tear this summer, and including Wednesday's gains, the stock is up more than 60% from its lows.  Google Finance FREE AppDownload

REUTERS/Darren StaplesManchester United's Wayne Rooney (R) talks to teammate Tyler Blackett after Swansea City scored a second goal during their English Premier League soccer match at Old Trafford in Manchester, northern England August 16, 2014. LONDON (Reuters) - Manchester United &lt;MANU.N&gt; targeted a swift return to the lucrative Champions League on Wednesday, after forecasting lower profit this season when the English soccer club will be absent from European competition for the first time in more than two decades. Twenty-times English champions, United will pay the price in this financial year for a season of rare sporting struggles in 2013-14, when the team finished only seventh in the Premier League and failed to qualify for Europe. Despite that poor form, improved TV and sponsorship deals helped United to report revenue of 433 million pounds ($698 million) in the year to the end of June, and core profit of 130 million, both record figures. But missing out on a place in the Champions League, Europe's top club competition, means United expects a decline in revenue to between 385 and 395 million pounds in the current year. Profit is forecast to fall to between 90 and 95 million. Those estimates are based on the club finishing third in the Premier League, underlining the pressure on new manger, Dutchman Louis van Gaal, to engineer a swift turnaround. United, majority owned by the American Glazer family, have spent heavily on new players, signing Argentine winger Angel di Maria from Real Madrid and recruiting Colombian striker Radamel Falcao, who joined on loan from Monaco. "We are very excited about the future and believe it's the start of a new chapter in the club‚Äôs history," Executive Vice-Chairman Ed Woodward said in a statement.              EUROPEAN RIVALSUnited's enforced European exile is set to widen the gap in revenue with their biggest continental rivals. European champions Real Madrid for instance reported revenue of 604 million euros ($779.6 million) in 2013-14, reinforcing the club's position as the game's top earners.   The influx of new players at United, at a total gross cost of around 150 million pounds, has quietened the Glazers' critics  who were angered when the family last month cashed in shares in the club worth around $200 million. United shares, listed on the New York Stock Exchange, slipped around 3 percent to $15.09 by 1112 EDT, valuing the club at about $2.5 billion. United made a shaky start to the current season, failing to win any of their three Premier League matches so far and being eliminated from the League Cup, the English game's third-most important competition after the Premier League and the FA Cup. However, Woodward said he expected Van Gaal to have the club back competing for titles and trophies after what he called a "challenging and disappointing season". There was evidence of the cost of those struggles in the small print of the club accounts. David Moyes, who lasted less than a season as United manager before he departed in April, shared a 5.2 million pound payoff with his backroom staff. United, whose executives claim 659 million global followers for the team nicknamed the Red Devils, remain a huge attraction for corporate sponsors. The club signed a 10-year kit supply deal with German sportswear company Adidas AG &lt;ADSGn.DE&gt; in July which will be worth 75 million pounds a year when it starts in 2015. United also sealed a record $559 million deal with General Motors Co &lt;GM.N&gt; to have the group's Chevrolet brand emblazoned on players' shirts for the next seven seasons.  (1 US dollar = 0.6203 British pound) (1 US dollar = 0.7747 euro)              (Editing by Louise Heavens and David Holmes) FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Russell CheyneA competitor at the annual World Pipe Band Championships at Glasgow Green in Scotland on Aug. 16. This paragraph from Credit Suisse should scare those in Scotland who might want independence from Great Britain: Risk of an economic crisis: In our opinion Scotland would fall into a deep recession. We believe deposit flight is both highly likely and highly problematic (with banks assets of 12x GDP) and should the BoE move to guarantee Scottish deposits, we expect it to extract a high fiscal and regulatory price (probably insisting on a primary budget surplus). The re-domiciling of the financial sector and UK public service jobs, as well as a legal dispute over North Sea oil, would further accelerate any downturn. In our opinion, as North Sea oil production slows, we estimate that the non-oil economy would need a 10% to 20% devaluation to restore competitiveness. This would require a 5% to 10% fall in wages, driven by a steep rise in unemployment. Meanwhile, this chart from the same report shows how gigantic Scotland's banking sector would be relative to its economy. Credit Suisse Just leaving that out there. FREE AppDownload

TwitterRaoul Pal, author of The Global Macro Investor.Former global macro fund manager Raoul Pal doesn't think financial television channels are providing real value for viewers.  That's why Pal has decided to take matters into his own hands by launching Real Vision Television — an on-demand, subscription video service providing a library of content on economics and investing.  "It's a real mix of things; it's somewhere between TED and Netflix and The Economist," Pal told Business Insider in a telephone interview. For the project, he teamed up with Grant Williams, the author of the newsletter Things That Make You Go Hmmm; U.K.-based advertising executive Damian Horner; and his own colleague Remi Tétot.   They felt that financial TV wasn't offering content that they wanted. For example, they didn't care about watching a company CEO go on about how great his or her firm was doing despite the economy.   "At its very core, I think we felt that people — general investors and the general public — were not getting access to open and honest discussion about economic and investment state-of-affairs," Pal said. "We think the world is kind of incredibly complicated right now, and people need to see a broader range of discussions to make their own decisions."  The launch of Real Vision Television also comes at a time where CNBC has just hit a 21-year low for viewership. Pal is well-known in the global macro space. He's a Goldman Sachs alumnus, and he co-managed GLG's global macro fund — one of the largest in the world. In 2004, he retired from managing money at age 36. Even out of the game, he has remained on the radar of some of the most brilliant global macro investors in the world. And even if you have not heard of Pal, you may recall an epic presentation he published back in 2012. The grim deck was called "The End Game," and in it he predicted a series of sovereign debt defaults and "the biggest bank crisis in history." While that didn't happen, Pal told us that the debt dynamics were still there and that "nothing" had been resolved. Pal, who lives in Spain, is the author of the highly regarded research publication The Global Macro Investor, which is read by the hedge fund elite (Hayman Capital's Kyle Bass once mentioned it in one of his fund's letters). A subscription to Pal's publication costs tens of thousands of dollars. Only a handful of people have access to the publication, and it never leaks to the public or the media. Pal's Real Vision Television will give more people access to his insights. It will include discussions with research analysts, hedge fund managers, newsletter writers, traders, etc.  Many of the well-known fund managers and analysts don't appear on people's radar screens because they don't tend to seek publicity or make media appearances. Pal nevertheless knows a lot big names that would contribute.   "The good thing is because we know so many of these people, because we've been around so long, that they were willing to get on board with us and help us with our mission," Pal said. A subscription for Real Vision Television will cost $400 per year. Right now, you can subscribe for $200.  "We want to make it affordable," Pal said. "That's the very idea — the idea is not to be an exclusive service. It's a way of educating a whole load of people in the way that they should be."  RealVisionTV.com FREE AppDownload

AppleGot to love those iPhone picturesI'm an Apple customer and shareholder. I watched parts of the live-stream of the launch yesterday — when it wasn't crapping out. I looked at pictures and videos of the new products. I read some early "takes" on the products. So it's time to rush to judgement. And here's my judgement — as a customer first, and then as a shareholder. My judgement as an Apple customer... THE iPHONE 6: Yay! Apple has finally caught up with the rest of the market and launched a smartphone that isn't tiny. I've been a loyal iPhone user for 5 years, and I've been waiting for this particular upgrade for the past two. The faster processor, better battery, and better camera are also appealing to me.  Great job, Apple. THE iPHONE 6 PLUS: Yay!! Bigger is better, and Apple has not only finally launched an iPhone that isn't tiny, it has launched an iPhone that is actually big. No more squinting. No more listening to movies because I can barely see them. No more watching sports without being able to see the ball. The iPhone 6 Plus has a bigger battery, too. The only thing that might deter me from getting the Plus is the weight — it might seem heavy. Everything else sounds great. Awesome job, Apple. APPLE PAY: Cool! Apple's vision is to make my wallet irrelevant. I would consider it awesome if Apple managed to do that. Apple has a long, long way to go in executing that vision, but Apple Pay is a strong step in the right direction. I find credit cards extremely convenient, however, so I'm not yet sold on the idea that Apple Pay is going to be that much more convenient than my wallet. But it looks a lot more convenient and cooler than any other "wallet" solutions out there to date. Now that Apple has adopted the NFC (Near Field Communication) standard, mobile payments may finally begin to gain critical mass.  APPLE WATCH: Meh. Yes, I know. Apple fanboys are hyperventilating about the Watch. Yes, Apple has done the Watch better than other earlier smartwatches. Yes, Apple fanboys will line up for days to buy the Watch and then, once they get it, collapse in paroxysms of pride and ecstasy. I don't care. I have zero interest in the watch. I've been waiting for years to have a bigger mobile screen, and I don't consider it even the slightest inconvenience to carry it around with me. The last thing I want to do is also carry a tiny screen, especially one that won't work without my iPhone. I don't want to carry another charge cord everywhere. I don't see anything the Watch can do that my iPhone can't do better (except, perhaps, some biometrics, which I don't care enough about to shell out another $349, put something on my wrist, and carry around another charge cord for). I realize that the Watch looks better than some other smartwatches, but it's still chunky and blocky.  $349 is a lot of money for something I don't need or want. So the fanboys will be having their religious experiences without me. Business InsiderLet's be honest: It's huge. My judgement as an Apple shareholder... I rarely trade stocks — I think it's an idiotic investment strategy for individual investors — but sometimes I can't help myself. Last year, when everyone decided that Apple was toast, and the stock crashed below $400 (~$50-ish in today's split), I couldn't help myself. Apple was still a great company, the stock looked very cheap (less than 10X earnings), and lots of cool products were coming. So I figured it was worth a shot. I already owned a ton of Apple stock, thanks to my index funds, but this purchase gave me an modest "overweight" position in Apple. I have maintained this "overweight" position for the past 18 months. But now everyone once again seems convinced that Apple's stock is going to the moon, and that scares me. I intend to go back to an "equal weight" position at some point. But, as of this writing, I haven't. I probably should have dumped my excess Apple yesterday, when the stock jumped to $103 in the seconds before the Watch was announced (it then plummeted). I think there's a decent chance that that will be the high for a while. Yahoo Finance The reason I hesitated is that Apple stock is still only trading at 16X earnings. And the company is poised for what I think will be a monstrous and monstrously profitable upgrade cycle with the iPhone 6. Make no mistake: The only Apple product that matters in terms of Apple's financial performance over the next year is the iPhone. The Watch is irrelevant. I expect Apple to continue to evolve and upgrade the Watch, and I expect it to become better (and better looking) over time. I expect that, someday, Apple will make the Watch autonomous, which will make it appeal to those who actually do mind carrying a smartphone around. I expect that the battery life will improve. I expect that some apps might come along that will finally enable the Watch to do something that is fundamentally different than what an iPhone does. But I do not expect that to happen over the next year. Apple is a huge company. It has nearly $200 billion of revenue. Even if Apple sold 10-20 million Watches next year, which would be a massive home run, this would add less than 5% revenue growth (assuming an average sales price of $400). Anyone who is expecting the Watch to turbocharge Apple's financial results next year is hallucinating. But the iPhone 6 is a different story. Every iPhone out there in the world is relatively tiny, and more than half are more than 2 years old. I think almost every iPhone owner in the world will want the bigger iPhone, and over the next two years, I expect the vast majority of them to upgrade. Furthermore, I expect many iPhone owners will want the bigger big iPhone. And that one will add an extra $100 to Apple's revenue (and a healthy dollop of that to profit) for every unit sold. So I think next year could be an excellent year for Apple, even if the Watch turns out to be a bomb. If next year were the only year that mattered, I wouldn't even consider selling my excess Apple stock — I would hold it until the stock price multiple expanded or the price got out of hand. Alas, next year isn't the only year that matters. The years after next year also matter. And that's where I have misgivings being overweight Apple stock. Why? Because I think the iPhone 6 upgrade will be the last huge upgrade cycle for the iPhone. Now that Apple finally has a big phone, it has a full range of screen sizes. Yes, future phones will get a bit faster. Yes, future phones will get a bit better. But I don't think most iPhone users will care about those incremental improvements enough to rush to upgrade. I think they'll save their money and keep using their already big, excellent iPhones until they break. After this big upgrade cycle runs its course, in other words, I think annual iPhone sales will shrink, especially if Apple persists in charging $800 for its phones while the average price of smartphones plummets worldwide. And I don't think any other product will ever be nearly as profitable for Apple as the iPhone (which accounts for an estimated 70% of Apple's profits). Yes, it's possible that the Watch, or a TV, or Apple Pay, or some other new Apple product will be a mega-hit and drive strong future profit growth. As a shareholder, I certainly hope so. But I'm not counting on it. So that's my current judgement as an Apple shareholder. I'm still hanging on, for now. But I'm not feeling all that great about it.

Bloomberg TVGina Martin AdamsAnother bear has turned bullish. Gina Martin Adams of Wells Fargo — Wall Street's biggest bear in 2013 — until recently had a year-end price target for the S&amp;P 500 of 1,850.  In a note to clients on Monday, Martin Adams folded. Sort of.   "We drop our former end-of-year price target of 1,850 for the S&amp;P 500 and introduce a 12-month forward price target of 2,100. Our earnings growth estimates continue to improve given improving domestic economic data and the Fed continues to signal they will tread very carefully in their attempt to unwind accommodative policy... Tactically, we continue to believe that equity investors should be on guard for a more challenging investment climate in the near term, as monetary policy certainty fades to uncertainty this autumn... In sum, we think it wise for investors to remain relatively selective toward stocks in the short term, but buy any policy-related weakness that develops over the next few quarters." Adams said the positive outlook for stocks comes from a "fundamental optimism toward equities from an improving economic and earnings backdrop," though she remains concerned about high stock valuations.  Back in January, Adams said the S&amp;P 500 could trade as high as 2,100 and as low as 1,500 over the next 12 months, saying that 2014 held "chills and thrills" for investors.  And maybe it has, but now, Adams says stocks are going higher.  We've recently seen some Wall Street strategists call for S&amp;P 3,000, a far bigger advance than Adams' call for a roughly 5% advance to S&amp;P 2,100. But last year, Adams stuck with a 1,440 price target for the S&amp;P through the whole year as the index climbed nearly 30% to close at 1,848, so calling for even a modest advance in the S&amp;P is something new from Adams.  On Tuesday, we highlighted commentary from Nomura's Bob Janjuah — also a noted stock market bear — who said that until the VIX closes below 10, stocks will continue to go higher.  So this makes two noted bears rolling over and turning bullish in just a few days.  Which could mean everything or nothing.

REUTERS/Valentin FlauraudKnowing something is likely to happen isn’t the same as knowing what to do about it. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise the fed funds rate next year for the first time since June 2006, though nobody knows exactly when it will act or how the markets will react when it does. But Credit Suisse strategists say that if similar policy shifts in the past are any guide, investors stand to gain significant upside from global equities right up until the central bank takes action, and maybe even for a short time after. In a note last month entitled, “Fed Up: When and What Happens,” Credit Suisse’s global equities strategy team studied four recent rate increases that marked a significant turn in monetary policy – in 1977, 1986, 1994, and 2004. There’s a reason people are inclined to dump equities in the face of impending rate increases: in three of those four instances, the S&amp;P 500 hit its peak fairly close to the actual rate hike – the same month in 1986 and 1994, and four months prior in 2004. The other, 1977, was a clear exception – the market topped 11 months before the hike. What’s more, the peaks have not been harbingers of a sharp decline. The market fell an average of just 3.4 percent between the four pre-hike peaks and the eventual rate increases. Stocks have also tended to regain ground quickly, rising an average of 3.7 percent in the six months after a rate increase. In three of the four instances, the S&amp;P 500 rose at least 10 percent within 18 months of the rate hike, albeit with corrections that have ranged from 6.2 percent to 9.5 percent. “While rate rises have historically led to greater volatility in equity markets, they have not marked the end of equity bull markets,” say Credit Suisse’s equities strategists. Credit Suisse economists expect a rate hike in the third quarter of next year, but the bank’s equities strategists warn it could happen as soon as the second quarter if current strong employment growth and rebounds in the housing market and corporate capital expenditures result in faster-than-expected GDP growth. And they foresee a correction of 5 percent near the end of 2014, followed by a second correction of between 5 and 10 percent in the three months following the hike. But here’s the important thing: The strategists think stocks will climb significantly higher before either of those two corrections occurs, while also recouping their losses in short order. One factor underlying that optimism: they think investors are pricing in a much larger rise in bond yields than seems likely — the equity risk premium is currently 5.4 percent, while the strategists say 4.2 percent would be more appropriate at this stage of a business cycle. They also believe that pension funds and insurance companies that tend to be overweight bonds will rebalance their portfolios away from fixed income and (partly) toward equities as rates rise and fixed income assets start to underperform. Finally, the strategists believe the world’s major central banks would rather risk above-target inflation than stifle the recovery with prematurely aggressive tightening. Since equities are an inflation hedge and inflation doesn’t tend to erode P/E multiples until it reaches 4 percent or higher, this policy dynamic favors stocks. Some caution is obviously warranted. U.S. equities are likely to underperform in a global portfolio due to a strengthening dollar, divergent monetary policy, and high valuations. Stocks with high dividend yields tend to perform poorly as rates rise, and highly leveraged European companies with significant domestic sales (utilities, telecoms, food retailers) could suffer as the euro weakens and borrowing costs rise. Lastly, the strategists point out one wrinkle: Investment-grade corporate bond markets have not priced in a rate hike as high-yield bonds have started to do, and may struggle to compete as a larger supply of high-quality bonds comes on the market after the Fed ends its asset purchases. But there’s lots of time – and potential upside – between now and then. What kinds of equities are poised to outperform in the face of looming rate hikes? Industries that benefit directly from rising rates, such as banks and life insurance companies, are clearly worth considering. The same goes for European companies that have significant U.S. sales and would therefore benefit from a weaker euro/stronger dollar, including pharmaceutical, health care, and consumer staples firms. Rising borrowing costs in Europe and the U.S. should also benefit companies with low financial leverage and high fixed costs, such as technology firms. Finally, investors could still see considerable upside from companies that would benefit from increased corporate capex. Even with a few speed bumps ahead, investors who worry too much about getting out in time run the risk of leaving too soon. FREE AppDownload
AP / Fernando LlanoA demonstrator fires marbles with a slingshot during anti-government riots over the economy earlier this year.President Nicolas Maduro is mulling a politically risky move to raise highly subsidized gasoline prices in Venezuela for the first time in 17 years, but may be put off for now by fears of a social backlash. With 95 octane gas on sale for less than two U.S. cents a liter most motorists can fill up for under $1 - less than a small bottle of drinking water. Pump attendants often end up with a bigger tip than the cost of the fuel. Subsidizing the world's cheapest gasoline costs the South American OPEC member about $12.5 billion a year, the government says. With its finances reeling and generous welfare programs to fund, the socialist government has for months been preparing Venezuelans for a hike of the almost laughably low prices at the pump. Ministers and state media have been constantly mentioning the possibility, while the ruling party has been debating it. Fuel prices, though, are a hot-button issue in the country with the world's biggest oil reserves, as many Venezuelans deem cheap fuel a birthright, and Maduro seems to be heeding the public's concerns and potential anger. Thomson ReutersA man pumps gasoline at a service station in Caracas "Be careful. I'm warning the government," said Ismael Hernandez, spokesman of a government-affiliated leftist group Marea Socialista. "Remember that in 1989 the increase in gas price was the trigger for a revolution." The 1989 fuel price increase sparked massive riots that claimed hundreds of lives, traumatized Venezuelans and rocked the presidency of Carlos Andres Perez. The so-called "Caracazo," roughly translated as the "Caracas disaster," still haunts Venezuela, and there has only been one other gasoline price adjustment since, in 1997, without incident. About 55 percent of Venezuelans are against increasing gas prices again, according to local pollster Hinterlaces. An increase would hit the poor, the government's traditional base of support, especially hard, given the inevitable inflationary impact on daily costs like buses and food. "We deserve subsidized fuel," said Antonio Lugo, a 63 year-old lawyer. "I think it's incredible that in an oil-producing country they want to increase fuel prices on us."  Maduro, whose popularity has slipped to below 40 percent according to some local pollsters, appears skittish about taking the plunge, out of worry it could revive the three-month protests that rocked Venezuela at the start of the year. "I want to tell Venezuelans who may be worried: there's no rush," he said last month. "The homeland has resources for its development." REUTERS/Miraflores Palace/HandoutPresident Maduro says there's "No Rush" in an attempt to calm public fears over the rise.Then last week, he pushed out the plan's main proponent, Rafael Ramirez, from his twin posts as oil minister and boss of state oil company PDVSA, diminishing market expectations of a hike, even though Maduro has not formally taken it off the table. A price increase would pile further pressure on Venezuelans, already struggling with annual inflation over 60 percent and shortages of goods ranging from corn flour to medicines. "Gas does need to be increased," said Roberto Enriquez, head of opposition party Copei. "But a gas increase, given Venezuela's current economic contraction, will have a devastating effect on the economy, and an explosive one on inflation." Economists, however, say maintaining the status quo will likely hasten the country's economic decline. Environmentalists, for their part, blast low gas prices for disincentivizing the use of alternative fuels and clogging up roads. Some Venezuelans say they are open to an increase, as long as the government stops shipping subsidized oil to allied countries such as Cuba. "First they should control the giveaways abroad," said taxi driver Jaime Lasarte, 60, as he filled up his Chevrolet Impala in Caracas. "Then they can raise our gasoline."   (Additional reporting by Eyanir Chinea in Caracas and Silene Ramirez in Santiago; Writing by Alexandra Ulmer; Editing by Andrew Cawthorne and Jeffrey Benkoe) FREE AppDownload
Ed YardeniThe recent outperformance by the EM MSCI has been remarkable since many emerging markets depend on exports to the Eurozone, which has been very weak, and to China, which has been slowing. In addition, in the past, the EM MSCI (in dollars) usually declined when commodity prices were falling and the dollar was strengthening. The EM MSCI has diverged from this pattern so far this year. Perhaps a macroeconomic perspective isn’t as useful as in the past in gauging the likely performance of the EM MSCI. It may simply be that there are enough positive internal developments underway in enough of the emerging economies to drive the overall EM MSCI stock price index higher. There clearly are positive homegrown stories in India, Indonesia, Mexico, and a few other EMs that are attracting global investors. The stories tend to be about economic reforms that could spur more domestic growth. An even simpler explanation for the outperformance of the EM MSCI is that it has been and still is relatively cheap compared to the other MSCI stock composites based on their forward P/Es at the end of August: US (16.0), EMU (13.7), Japan (13.7), UK (13.6), and EM (11.3). Ed YardeniToday's Morning Briefing: Ahead of the Pack. (1) US is ahead of the world benchmark this year and since the start of the bull market. (2) Faltering economies weighing on EMU and Japan MSCIs. (3) No sign of secular stagnation in US stock market performance. (4) Emerging Markets MSCI also outperforming this year despite weakening commodity prices and strengthening dollar. (5) Homegrown stories may be boosting EM stocks. (6) Or maybe they are just relatively cheap. (7) Forward earnings at record highs for 7 of 10 S&amp;P 500 sectors. (8) Interest-rate-sensitive sectors underperforming again.

"I'm almost certain that Janet Yellen doesn't want to raise interest rates." On Tuesday, DoubleLine's Jeff Gundlach held his latest webcast presentation giving an overview of his views on the markets and the economy, and among his key points was his belief that the Fed would not raise rates as much — or as quickly — as some might expect. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen has long said she remains focused on the health of the labor market, and in her most recent public comments at Jackson Hole, she said that given the current state of the labor market, there was "no simple recipe for appropriate policy in this context." And for Gundlach, one chart makes clear why Yellen's desire to raise interest rates is most likely far less than many assume. Wages as a percent of GDP remain near multidecade lows, and until this trend shows any sign of improvement, Gundlach doesn't think that Yellen will want to do anything with interest rates. Gundlach also noted that real wages for the bottom seven deciles of earners had fallen between 2007 and 2014, to which Gundlach said, "It seems tough that with so many workers losing purchasing power on a year-over-year basis, you could raise short-term interest rates." Many in the market seem to believe that after the Fed concludes its quantitative easing program in October, the Fed will be pressed to raise rates in the face of a growing economy and improving labor market. But without any meaningful wage gains, which would require the reversal of a generational trend, Gundlach's view is clear: "This is why Janet Yellen doesn't want to raise rates."

Spencer Platt/Getty ImagesPeople walk in New York City's financial district.Once you’ve finally landed that coveted position as a research analyst, how do you stand out from the crowd in this highly competitive field? Many of the skills needed for a successful investment management career are not taught in business schools, and so I’ve been enumerating the unconventional skills you will need to build a successful career in finance. Thus far I’ve covered: In this installment, we will discuss forthrightness. You may have mastered all other skills necessary for successful investment management, but knowing, and communicating that you know something, are entirely different skill sets. Translating the insights of the right brain into language — a more linear form — takes tremendous skill. Here investment professionals are able to speak the truth of what they think and know in such a way that the often abstruse thought processes of investment analysis are made clear for listeners, such as portfolio managers, chief investment officers, and boards of directors. Forthrightness differs from honesty in that it insists that investment managers speak the truth as they see it and to volunteer their opinions without heavily filtering the message. When you consistently take this approach, decisions become easier to make because people seem to have an innate sense of the truth of your statements. If you want to be more forthright and for your words to ring with truth, try working with the following mental framework. Words are typically perceived as authentic by listeners when the following five states honored evenly: inspiration, imagination, thought, word, and deed. When each of the five steps are in place and working together seamlessly, then magical things can happen for investment managers. This includes: changing the asset allocation of a portfolio; or creating an ideal set of questions with which to pepper an intransigent business management so that you get to the truth of a situation; or developing a new way of looking at all businesses that leads to new analytical insights; or divining what to write to your shareholders in your semiannual report so that it conveys your true regret at a bad decision — but in such a way that you get to keep your job and restore trust. As a part of the original job candidate materials I submitted to my first employer in finance, I included a copy of my master’s thesis. I concluded that active managers outperform passive managers — contrary to popular opinion — so long as you use downside measures of risk and not measures of volatility in calculating Sharpe and Treynor ratios. During a subsequent in-person interview for that research analyst job, my interviewer turned to me and said, “You know I think your thesis is a load of bull!” I took a deep breath to dissipate my emotions and to center on some inspiration. Namely, I did not feel that my interviewer read my thesis; this was my inspired insight. Knowing what I knew about the firm — that they were active managers — I could not imagine that he had read the thesis. I then remembered that when I entered his office for the interview he was on a conference call with a company and that he was then busy checking e-mails for a while, keeping our interview at bay; this was the ‘thought’ stage of forthrightness. I also committed myself to challenge him on whether or not he read the thesis (the word phase), and then replied (deed phase), “I don’t think you read it all the way through, because it actually advocates strongly for the power of active management.” Normally the advice given to interview candidates is to be a shrinking violet and to not challenge the interviewer. But in this instance, my words resulted in the interviewer blushing and then saying, “Well you are right. Why don’t you tell me what your thesis is about?” I eventually received a job offer, which I accepted. This is the nature of truth when it is spoken: It cuts through abstruse layers of conversational and intellectual confusion. FREE AppDownload

Thomson ReutersThe Bank of Japan building is pictured in TokyoBy Leika Kihara KANAZAWA Japan (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan drove a short-term interest rate below zero, a dramatic step in its already unprecedented effort to stoke inflation and a likely sign it will continue its aggressive asset purchases. The BOJ bought three-month bills for more than their redemption value on Tuesday, traders said, essentially paying to lend money to the market. The central bank's first purchase at a yield less than zero underscores its determination to pay literally any price to help reflate the long-moribund economy. BOJ officials wouldn't confirm the negative-yield purchases, which were part of a market operation that bought 500 billion yen (US$4.7 billion) of short-term bills, on the grounds they cannot disclose individual transactions. But the bank was clearly untroubled by the idea of crossing this line. "Basically, I don't see any problem" with buying at below-zero rates, BOJ Deputy Governor Kikuo Iwata said on Wednesday during a visit to Kanazawa in central Japan. "I don't think this will cause any disruptions in the BOJ's market operations." Having paid such a high price, the BOJ will likely have to continue doing so as banks know it is determined to meet its target of asset purchases, potentially pushing negative yields out to longer-dated debt, market participants said. The unconventional move, and the prospect of more to come, could revive criticism that the BOJ is "monetizing" the national debt - essentially giving politicians carte blanche to spend the money the BOJ is printing under its easing program. Giving away money, as the BOJ will be doing if it holds the paper to maturity, could also be seen as subsidizing Japanese banks. Lenders that buy debt from the government stand to make an easy profit if the government pays above par for the paper. But going below zero does not signal that the BOJ will soon need to formally change policy, said officials familiar with the central bank's thinking. Indeed, they said, negative yields are a consequence of the current massive asset purchases that are aimed at ending 15 years of deflation by doubling base money in the economy and pushing consumer-price inflation to 2 percent during the fiscal year from next April. By contrast, the European Central Bank in recent months has explicitly targeted a negative rate for its overnight deposit rate below zero. Although the BOJ pioneered "quantitative easing" - targeting the amount of liquidity injections rather than an interest rate - in the early 2000s, negative yields represent new territory for a central bank that already buys the equivalent of 70 percent of all new government debt issued. BOJ officials acknowledged from the start of Governor Haruhiko Kuroda's "quantitative and qualitative easing" (QQE) last year that at some stage they might have to take extreme steps to nudge financial institutions into selling their Japanese government bond holdings.  NO TURNING BACK In targeting an amount of purchases, the BOJ has been ready to keep buying assets to meet the target, no matter the cost. "The BOJ has to buy bills at market prices," said Tadashi Matsukawa, head of fixed-income investments in PineBridge Investments. "And if they are traded at a negative yield, the BOJ has no choice but to buy them at negative yields." Early on in QQE, it was relatively easy for the BOJ to buy government debt from the market as the three "megabanks" had plenty of bonds in their portfolios, after years of weak loan demand led them to park their deposits in JGBs. But as the major lenders have reduced their JGB holdings significantly, it has become increasingly difficult for the BOJ to coax them into parting with the debt. The timing of the drop below zero may partly be seasonal. "Japanese banks want to hold more government bills as safe assets ahead of their half-year book-closings in September," said Izuru Kato, chief economist at Totan Research Institute. "After the book-closings, bill yields could rise back above zero," he said. "Still, the BOJ's holding of discount bills is constantly rising ...so yields will remain under pressure." Central bank officials have been relatively optimistic that they can keep buying debt in huge amounts by offering prices too attractive for banks to resist. In any event, there is no turning back. If, as looks likely, more banks demand above-par prices for debt, it could make the BOJ's market operations tougher, exposing the limits of a stimulus program that has already dried up the JGB market.

The Swiss franc is sinking against the U.S. dollar after Swiss National Bank governor Thomas Moser said the Bank is "open" to negative interest rates, reports The Wall Street Journal. WSJ's Todd Buell reported Wednesday that Moser told the paper at an academic conference in Hamburg: "We have always said [negative rates] is a possibility... We're never shy about it…we always said we would use it if needed." Moser's comments come after the European Central Bank last week announced further rate cuts, taking its deposit facility interest rate to -0.2%.  The use of negative interest rates by a central bank is a unconventional tactic aimed at boosting bank lending in an effort to jumpstart the economy. The basic idea is that if a central bank charges interests, rather than pays interest, on reserves held at the bank, then depositors would be more likely to lend money out than keep it parked in an account it has to pay for.  In morning trade on Wednesday, Moser's comments sent the U.S. dollar to new highs against the franc, with one dollar now buying abut 0.9377 francs.  FinViz The euro also rallied against the franc following reports of Moser's comments.

REUTERS/Yves HermanJean-Claude Juncker, the incoming president of the EC, presents the list of the European Commissioners Jean-Claude Juncker, the incoming president of the European Commission, seems to be making an attempt to mend fences with the United Kingdom in naming a British politician to oversee financial services policy in Europe as part of the new commission team. It's a shocking move.  The decision comes after British Prime Minister David Cameron fiercely resisted the selection of Juncker as commission president warning in June that it would push Britain closer to an exit from the E.U. Juncker is seen as a European federalist who would push for closer integration within the region, potentially leaving countries outside of the single currency — like Britain — isolated. Given the history, his decision to give Jonathan Hill, former leader of the House of Lords, the important financial services job suggests he trying to quash lingering resentment before taking office. The role is seen as particularly critical as tensions rise between officials in London and other regulators in Europe.  Rhetoric between the two sides has been ratcheting up in recent months with Brussels attempting to impose a cap of 100% of salaries — or 200% with shareholder approval — on bonuses paid to bank employees. Britain has so far resisted the move because it's worried that bonus limits could make London less competitive relative to other global financial centers.  Earlier this month, an attempt by Westminster to overturn the cap was met with a cool response from judges at the European Court of Justice. Further noises from the Commission in recent months, which suggest centralizing regulatory oversight of financial institutions and markets, have also been greeted frostily on the British side. Hill will no doubt find his new role already pockmarked with potential pitfalls when he takes office, but if it marks a deescalation of tensions between Britain and its European counterparts it is likely to be taken as positive by markets. The last thing Europe needs right now is further instability so British sensitivities look as if they will be appeased, at least for the moment. FREE AppDownload

Apple Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster said the "star of the show" was Apple Pay — the company's new wireless payment system. It will allow iPhone 6 and 6 Plus users to pay for a burger at McDonald's or groceries at Whole Foods Market at the tap of a button, using their American Express, Visa, or MasterCard bank cards. Samsung Electronics, Motorola Mobility, and others include similar wireless technology in many Android smartphones. But with payment systems such as Google's Wallet failing to catch on, the technology is not standard in handsets. "On the mobile payments front, we believe the company made a major breakthrough and cracked an important and vexing issue that has plagued the industry for several years regarding customer ownership," William Blair analysts wrote in a note. Cook, who took over as CEO from Steve Jobs in 2011, has been under pressure to launch new services and come up with larger-screen phones to counter Samsung's popular Galaxy Note phablets. Worldwide market share of iPhones, which contribute more than half of Apple's revenue, slipped to 11.7% for the quarter ended June from 13% a year earlier, according to research firm IDC. "Apple Pay is a feature that should help sell Apple products and provide some small help to the bottom line," BMO Capital Markets analysts said. Apple Watch, the company's first new product since the iPad, is tethered to the iPhone 6 models. Starting at $349, it will receive phone calls and messages, play music, and serve as a digital wallet to pay for goods. The watch, which will go on sale in the U.S. next year, has received mixed reactions. Fashion commentators like its clean aesthetic, while some tech writers pointed out Apple's silence over battery life. Sony, Samsung, LG Electronics, and Qualcomm have launched smartwatches based on Google's Android Wear, without great success. Apple shares were trading down 0.6% at $97.45 in premarket trading. They closed down 0.38% at $97.99 on the Nasdaq on Tuesday. (Additional reporting by Lehar Maan in Bangalore; Editing by Robin Paxton)  This article originally appeared at Reuters.  Copyright 2014.

AP Photo/Ron ThomasKenneth Rogoff.It doesn't matter whether Scotland votes to stay in the U.K. or cut ties with the Union. Economist and Harvard professor Kenneth Rogoff says that either way, the Scottish independence referendum is already a disaster. He also warns that it sets a precedent for other economies in Europe that wish to split from the eurozone currency unions. In an interview with CNBC, the former director of research at the International Monetary Fund said that Scotland would feel the sting first. Even though the Scottish government has said that the independence vote is a "once-in-a-generation opportunity," it doesn't mean that independence is off the table. "Even if it doesn't pass, people are not going to want to invest there because they might do it again. People will migrate out of there," Rogoff told CNBC. Scotland could also serve as a catalyst for other incorporated regions to demand independence, Rogoff said. That would be bad for the European Union. "Other places in Europe will say, 'Hey, we can do that too.' So it's certainly quite a wild card there," he said. The Yes and No camps are nearly neck-in-neck, with those in support of independence gaining a surprising lead in the polls late in the game. British Prime Minister David Cameron is currently in Scotland making a last-minute appeal to keep the union intact. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney also warned about the economic implications of independence, dismissing pro-independence leader Alex Salmond's plan for a currency union. The independence referendum will be held Thursday, Sept. 18, and the results should be released the next day. FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Kazuhiro NogiElon Musk (L), chief executive of Tesla Motors and SpaceX, and Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe pose with a model of a rocket during a courtesy call at the latter's official residence in Tokyo September 9, 2014. CARSON CITY Nev. (Reuters) - Nevada lawmakers on Wednesday will consider controversial tax breaks estimated at up to $1.3 billion for Tesla Motors Inc &lt;tsla.o&gt; to build its $5 billion battery factory in the state. Assembly Speaker Marilyn Kirkpatrick promised scrutiny of the legislation, which has drawn criticism from both ends of the political spectrum, at a special session around noon PDT (1500 EDT). "It's exciting that a company such as Tesla has chosen Nevada," said Kirkpatrick, a North Las Vegas Democrat. "But the devil is in the details." Republican Governor Brian Sandoval last week called Nevada’s winning bid against four other states a monumental moment. He said it would change Nevada's economic climate and spur $100 billion in economic benefits over the next 20 years. The agreement the state hammered out with Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk is among the largest tax subsidies in the nation. Sandoval said the state's investment would pay off at an 80-1 ratio, which critics say is wishful thinking. "We think the 80-1 multiplier is disingenuous, and if that's wrong, what else is wrong?" said Bob Fulkerson, executive director of the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada. "Local governments are going to have immediate financial costs of public safety, trash collection, schools," he said, "and existing residents and taxpayers are going to have to pay for that." The conservative group Americans for Prosperity slammed the agreement as corporate welfare. "This deal amounts to nothing more than a tax handout for a politically connected billionaire," AFP State Director Daryn Iwicki said in a statement. He noted that Tesla officials had said the size of the incentives was not the main reason they chose Nevada for the factory. Musk has said the factory where it will build lithium ion batteries in partnership with Panasonic Corp &lt;6752.T&gt; is crucial to Tesla’s goal of mass marketing its next generation of electric cars by 2017. As part of the plan, the company would get sales tax exemptions estimated at $725 million through June 2034 and save more than $300 million in payroll and other taxes through 2024. Tesla would also receive $75 million in tax credits for up to 6,000 jobs created, $120 million for meeting state investment thresholds of $3.5 billion, and reduced utility rates. For its part, Tesla said it would contribute more than $37 million over five years to Nevada’s education system. Sandoval, who took office in 2011 when Nevada's economy was crushed under the weight of recession, has made job creation and economic development a cornerstone of his administration. He has called the Tesla factory a catapult to attract high-tech industries and diversify Nevada’s economy. Sandoval said the 5-million-square-foot plant east of Reno would mean 3,000 construction jobs and 6,500 jobs once in operation. His office said it would spur an additional 16,000 indirect jobs and boost the region’s gross domestic product by 20 percent.

Here's what you need to know: Alibaba's Record-Breaking IPO May Already Be Covered. "Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. has received enough orders for its record-breaking initial public offering to cover the entire deal within just two days of its launch, people familiar with the IPO process said on Wednesday," reported Reuters' Jessica Toonkel, Olivia Oran, and Elzio Barreto. "There was no indication as to where most of that demand was in the $60-$66 per share indicative range for the IPO, said the people, who couldn't be named because details of the offering demand aren't yet public." ... Investors Say Alibaba's Jack Ma Is Killing It ... "While corporate governance remains a concern, several fund managers and analysts said [Alibaba CEO] Ma gave an impressive performance during the company's pitch in Boston on Tuesday for what stands to be the largest-ever U.S. technology IPO," reported Reuters' Tim McLaughlin. "He's executed well," said Will Danoff, who runs Fidelity Investments' $111 billion Contrafund. ... But None Of Alibaba's Bankers Have The Whole Story. "Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.'s desire to keep tight control over its $21.1 billion share sale has left a vacuum at the helm of its banking syndicate, leading underwriters to take unusual steps to manage the offering, according to sources familiar with the situation," reported Reuters' Liana Baker, Elzio Barreto, and Olivia Oran. "The move gives Alibaba control of the process as no one bank has a complete picture of what is going on. It also helps avoid potential pitfalls of relying too much on one institution. Facebook's botched 2012 IPO was also one of the reasons for this choice, sources have previously said." Dollar General Goes Hostile With Family Dollar Bid.

"A second month of positive growth in the French industrial sector is encouraging, but mean-reversion in energy production is distorting the headline print," noted Pantheon Macroeconomics' Claus Vistesen. "Energy production was up 2.0% month-on-month with the other key goods production components weak across the board. The improvement is real, but we would like to see more broad-based gains across sectors before we get too optimistic." Markets Are Mixed. In Europe, Britain's FTSE is up 0.2%, France's CAC 40 is up 0.1%, and Germany's DAX is flat. Asia closed mixed, with Japan's Nikkei up 0.2% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng down 1.9%. U.S. futures are up modestly with Dow futures up 13 points and S&amp;P futures up 1.4 points. Ackman Goes Hyperbolic On Allergan.

Thomson ReutersFile photo of Executive Chairman of Spain's Santander Emilio Botin taking part in the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders in SantanderMADRID — Emilio Botin, one of Spain's most powerful men who transformed Santander from a small domestic lender into the euro zone's biggest bank, has died of a heart attack, aged 79. The bank said on Wednesday it would hold a board meeting later in the day to nominate a successor as chairman. Analysts and investors have long expected this would be Botin's eldest daughter Ana Botin, who heads Santander's British business. Such a move could spark controversy, however, with banking dynasties coming under scrutiny after a scandal at Portugal's Banco Espirito Santo, where the founding family's holdings are under scrutiny over financial irregularities. "Succession shouldn't just be saying 'my daughter's going to take over'," said a corporate governance expert at a global asset manager which owns Santander shares, speaking on condition of anonymity. At 0805 GMT (4.05 a.m. EDT), Santander stock was down 1.7 percent at 7.62 euros. Emilio Botin, "El Presidente" to his co-workers and the third generation of Botins to run Santander, used his keen eye for a deal to spread the bank's red-liveried brand with its stylised 'S' logo around the world, amassing 1.4 trillion euros ($1.8 trillion) of funds and nearly 200,000 employees. "He was a man who has been able to make Banco Santander the most important bank of our country," Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy told journalists in Parliament. "I had a meeting with him last week and he was well and in good form. It has been a surprise and a blow." Botin started out with a campaign to attract depositors in 1989, forcing rivals to compete on price, and bought troubled lender Banesto in 1994, making Santander Spain's biggest bank. He then took advantage of cultural and language ties by expanding rapidly into Latin America and in 2004 scored his biggest coup with the purchase of British lender Abbey National for more than 9 billion pounds ($14.5 billion). The expansion helped to shield Santander from the euro zone debt crisis and Spain's long-running recession, with the bank now making only about 14 percent of its profit at home. But it has not been unscathed. Santander has trailed the total returns to shareholders delivered in the past 10 years by rivals JPMorgan and HSBC - two firms Botin liked to measures himself against, according to colleagues. Few doubt Ana Botin, 53, has a strong claim to succeed her father. After an eight-year early stint at JPMorgan's investment bank, she has spent most of the last 25 years at Santander. But her high profile in the bank has already caused controversy. Earlier this year two shareholder advisory firms, ISS and Glass Lewis &amp; Co, recommended shareholders vote against her re-election as a director - one because it thought Botins were over-represented on the board, the other because they considered there were not enough independent members. In the event, she got the backing of 81.3 percent of the votes, almost unchanged from three years earlier. "Botin was the unofficial king of Spain. His death creates uncertainty and a power vacuum at the top," said a London-based hedge fund manager, who declined to be named. "The obvious successor is his daughter Ana, which was always the plan, but he hasn’t had a proper chance to groom her and install her as chairwoman before he died so there could be some infighting."

Apple has teamed up with all three card issuers, as well as Bank of America, Capital One Bank, Chase, Citi and Wells Fargo — the six major card-issuing banks in the U.S., representing 83% of credit card purchase volume in the country. Their support for Apple Pay suggests the package is likely to be complementary to, rather than in competition with, their business models. REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach Forrester Research forecasts that the mobile payments market will be worth some $90 billion by 2017. Given the ubiquity of Apple products in the West, it occupies an almost unique position from which to gain market share quickly. But why not go it alone? Instead of using credit and debit cards to fuel Apple Pay, why not simply link Apple Pay directly to checking accounts, the way PayPal does? That would be a true disruption of the credit card business. Moreover, with some $164.5 billion in cash or cash equivalents on its balance sheet as at the end of June, it has more than enough ready capital to provide the necessary confidence to make a bespoke payment system work. One answer is that the shift to mobile payments may be a gradual one. In a survey released by the Federal Reserve in March, only 17% of mobile phone users report that they made a mobile payment in the past 12 months. That's up a meager 2% from 2012. At this stage, having the ability to pay using your iPhone might be a nice additional feature but it's unlikely (yet) to be the major selling point. Instead, despite the fanfare, Apple Pay may be more of a transitional stage designed to keep potential mobile competitors out while the company waits for market to build. This will have been top-of-mind for Apple executives with China's Alibaba Group preparing for what could be the largest IPO in U.S. history. The firm is reportedly looking to regain a stake in its e-commerce arm Alipay, spun off in 2011, after it processed some $519 billion-worth of payments in 2013. Unlike Apple, Alipay has gone toe-to-toe with large Chinese banks over control of payment services. Market research firm iResearch estimates that Alipay has over 400 million users and is one of the dominant players in mobile payments in China. With an established player in the space poised to enter the U.S. market, Apple may have felt that presenting a united front would be advantageous rather than starting a war that could leave the door open to new entrants. This may be bad news for retailers in the short term, as they will have to continue paying transaction fees for credit card payments. And for consumers the popularity of the service will rely on convenience rather than cost. But success in a competitive space means picking the right battles, and Apple has clearly decided that it wants to fight with the credit card companies, not against them. FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersA band of fog envelops downtown DenverNEW YORK (Reuters) - Applications for U.S. home mortgages fell last week as interest rates rose for the first time in four weeks, an industry group said on Wednesday. The Mortgage Bankers Association said its seasonally adjusted index of mortgage application activity, which includes both refinancing and home purchase demand, fell 7.2 percent in the week ended Sept. 5. The MBA's seasonally adjusted index of refinancing applications dropped 10.7 percent, while the gauge of loan requests for home purchases, a leading indicator of home sales, fell 2.6 percent. Fixed 30-year mortgage rates averaged 4.27 percent in the week, up 2 basis points from 4.25 percent the week before. The survey covers over 75 percent of U.S. retail residential mortgage applications, according to MBA.   (Reporting by Caroline Valetkevitch; Editing by Diane Craft) FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Brendan McDermidRepresentatives from Alibaba Group Holding arrive for the company's roadshow meeting in New York September 8, 2014. (Reuters) - Alibaba Group Holding Ltd has received enough orders for its record-breaking initial public offering to cover the entire deal within just two days of its launch, people familiar with the IPO process said on Wednesday. There was no indication as to where most of that demand was in the $60-$66 per share indicative range for the IPO, said the people, who couldn't be named because details of the offering demand aren't yet public. Alibaba, a Chinese e-commerce titan, didn't immediately return a request by Reuters for comment. At the top end of expectations, the Alibaba IPO would raise $21.1 billion, topping Facebook Inc's $16 billion listing in 2012 as the largest-ever technology IPO. Alibaba, could set a new record for the world's biggest IPO if underwriters exercise an option to sell additional shares to meet demand - putting it as high as $24.3 billion, and overtaking Agricultural Bank of China Ltd's $22.1 billion listing in 2010.

Thomson ReutersApple CEO Tim Cook speaks during an Apple event announcing the iPhone 6 and the Apple Watch at the Flint Center in CupertinoSINGAPORE/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc's embrace of wireless charging for its new Watch may be a defining moment for a technology that's languished for years amid competing standards and consumer confusion. Supporters of wireless charging see a future where people no longer worry about topping up their gadgets; are free from tangled power cords and low-battery warnings and where terms like "outlet" and "plugged in" will be as anachronistic as "dialing" a phone. Users seem to like the idea too: in a recent survey by technology consultancy IHS, 83 percent were interested in wireless charging; in China, the figure was 91 percent. But, while the technology is largely there to do this, competition to set a global standard is getting in the way of delivery. It's reminiscent of the Betamax vs VHS videotape wars of three or four decades ago, or the more recent battle between Blu-ray and HD DVD for supremacy in high definition optical disc format. For now, there are three alliances, but not much to show. Last year, fewer than 20 million phones were shipped with wireless charging built in, according to IHS - less than 2 percent of the billion smartphones shipped around the world. "There are a lot of bees around the hive," said Omri Lachman, CEO of Humavox, an Israeli start-up with its own wireless charging technology. "Up to now we've not seen a mass aggregation of wireless charging in devices. There's a good reason for that: three standards for the same form of technology." While users clearly see wireless charging - where mobiles, tablets and other devices are charged by laying them on a mat or other surface - as a natural next step, some industry leaders have cautioned that having to still plug in the charging device may prove fiddly for some. "Having to create another device you have to plug into the wall is actually, for most situations, more complicated," Apple senior vice president Phil Schiller said just two years ago. Maybe, but others say the wireless vision remains compelling. "Look at Star Trek," says Geoff Gordon of the Alliance for Wireless Power (A4WP), one of the three competing alliances. "They never talk about their batteries dying on any of their devices. If you look far enough into the future we're looking at a world where you don't even think about power." But to catch on, wireless charging has to work seamlessly. That means a user can easily find a wireless charging zone and not have to worry whether their device is compatible, or properly connected or even secure from theft. Intel Corp, a member of A4WP along with the likes of Samsung Electronics and Qualcomm Inc, says wireless charging is a lot like wireless computing. Just as the world has largely ditched network cables for wireless hotspots, so we will leave chargers and cables at home as we'll never be far from a charging pad. But getting there, the chipmaker argues, will require someone with its clout to set the global standard for wireless technology. "History will tell you it's what it takes to get mainstream lift-off," said Intel's Leighton Phillips. Among the competing standards, A4WP uses something called magnetic resonance, while the Wireless Power Consortium (WPC) - which includes tech names such as Nokia and Philips - champions its Qi standard using inductive charging, a method which is also used by the Power Matters Alliance (PMA). They are all variations of the same technology: a coil inside the device picks up an electrical charge from a transmitter coil in the charging surface. Apple, which sits outside the alliances, appears to have used a version of induction charging in its Watch, further muddying the waters. Sparring in a battle for leadership in a market that IHS reckons will be worth $8.5 billion by 2018 - as the technology is incorporated into devices, furniture, cars, restaurants - the alliances fling accusations at one another. The WPC accuses its rivals of trying "to benefit from intellectual property they think they own," in the words of WPC vice president for market development John Perzow, instead of "what benefits the consumer." The WPC's Qi brand is the only one to have made any real headway on the market, doubling its annual shipments to 20 million devices last year. The PMA has a couple of products out, while the first devices carrying the A4WP's Rezence brand are expected to be shipped this year. A4WP supporters say the WPC has had its chance and blown it. "Very quickly the momentum behind A4WP will dwarf anything that Qi has accomplished," says Alex Gruzen, CEO of U.S.-based WiTricity.  The PMA, meanwhile, has focused less on the hardware and more on the application programing interface that would allow others to connect to it. Its main backers are companies like Procter &amp; Gamble and Starbucks Corp, which promises to roll out charging surfaces in its U.S. outlets by the end of next year.  The groups all agree on one thing: squabbling over standards has kept smartphone manufacturers, furniture designers and car makers from building wireless charging technology into their products as much as they might if the technology's future were clearer.  The Jeep Cherokee, for example, includes a wireless charging pad, and Cadillac has announced plans to add wireless charging in 2015 models - but drivers will only be able to use the feature if they have compatible phones. There are signs of progress: the A4WP and the PMA in February agreed to ensure their two standards work well together. But for wireless charging to take off, Intel says, it not only needs compatible devices and charging mats in homes and offices, but also a broader public infrastructure - coffee shops, hotels, malls.  "The vision we have and that Starbucks has is that it becomes part of the slipstream of your life," says Powermat president Daniel Schreiber. "How do we make power come to you rather than have you think about power?" There are other issues. One is that the technology still needs to be easier to use. In some cases, a device can't just be dropped anyhow onto a charging pad - it needs to be aligned or it either won't charge, or will charge more slowly. Also, fitting charging coils into devices isn't as simple as it may sound. "Coils have a physical limitation that won't change with size," said Humavox's Lachman. "A lot of people have been trying to fit that into the device." "All the companies are working around the clock to figure out how to pull in that technology and make sure it works," says Pavan Pudipeddi, CEO of PowerSquare, which in July launched a charging pad using Qi which allows users to recharge multiple devices. Pudipeddi welcomed the launch of Apple's Watch with wireless charging. "Others will feed off that and it's good for the technology in general," he said. Meanwhile, the dithering over an industry standard is opening up opportunities for others. Some companies like uBeam, for example, use ultrasound, converting electricity to sound and sending that over the air as ultrasound. Others, like Humavox, use radio frequencies, where the coils are replaced by antennae. "Our decision to build this technology from the ground up is proving the right choice," said Lachman. "Wireless charging has been out there for five years and nothing's happening." (Editing by Ian Geoghegan) FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersPeople shop at H&M on Thanksgiving Day in New YorkNEW YORK (Reuters) - Alison LePard, a 19-year-old college sophomore from Wellesley, Massachusetts, says that when she shops for clothes and accessories, her goal is a look that is uniquely hers. So she does a lot of mixing and matching. "I don't blindly follow what they put out," LePard said of store displays. "I don't want to wear just one brand. I don't want to be a stereotype." She's hardly alone. Recent surveys have found that members of the U.S. Millennial Generation - the roughly 80 million Americans born between 1977 and 2000 - pride themselves on their individuality, and shop accordingly. Compared with their parents, millennials are far less likely to identify with a political party or to formally affiliate with a religion - key indicators of an independent streak - according to Pew Research Center. As shoppers, they are less attached to brands and more willing to create their own style, surveys by Nielsen, The Boston Consulting Group and other researchers have found. This generational trait is forcing retailers to rethink everything from their merchandise and marketing to their dressing rooms and logos. Some companies, including H&amp;M and Urban Outfitters Inc &lt;urbn.o&gt;, have ridden the individuality wave while others, such as Abercrombie &amp; Fitch &lt;anf.n&gt; and Aeropostale&lt;aro.n&gt;, have been slow to react and are paying the price. At stake is the $600 billion millennials spend a year in the United States, according to Accenture, a sum that's projected to grow to an estimated $1.4 trillion in 2020, when the oldest of the cohort will be 43. Millennial men spend twice as much a year on apparel as non-millennial men, while millennial women outspent other generations by a third, the consultants said. Abercrombie's woes came into sharp relief last month when the company said it was shrinking its well-known logo and increasing its assortment of fashion for women, all to appeal more to 16- to 22-year-olds who don't want to look like everyone else. The move came after 10 straight declines in quarterly same-store sales. "They no longer want to be a walking billboard of a brand," said Michael Scheiner, an Abercrombie spokesman. "Individualism is important to them, having their own sense of style." Other companies are also adjusting their strategies to reach this elusive group. Gap Inc's &lt;gps.n&gt; new ad campaign, with the facetious tag line, "dress normal," is all about creating an individual style -- the idea being that there is no normal. Aeropostale, for its part, says its new product lines by blogger Bethany Mota are meant to convey "authenticity, emotion and relevance." Mall owners have had to adjust, too. Indianapolis-based Simon Property Group Inc &lt;spg.n&gt; is now working with fashion magazines and fashion website Refinery29.com to entice millennial shoppers to the mall with videos, new designers and personalized advice. "Not looking like everyone else is key to everything about what we do," said Chidi Achara, Simon's global creative director. The drive to reach millennials comes during a difficult environment for retailers. Retail spending was flat in August, according to the U.S. Commerce Department, and household spending dropped by 0.1 percent in July, the first decline since January. In August, retailers ranging from Wal-Mart Stores Inc &lt;wmt.n&gt; to Macy's Inc &lt;m.n&gt; cut their sales forecasts.  Thanks to the Internet and smart phones, millennials are more informed shoppers than older generations. More than 70 percent of 18- to 34-year-olds recently surveyed by The Intelligence Group said they research options online before going to a store. Millennials spend a higher share of dollars online than other generations, according to market research and consulting firm NPD Group, though they still make 75 percent of their purchases at brick and mortar stores. With vast amounts of information easily available, they are savvy shoppers who know how to compare price, quality and convenience. Accustomed to building Facebook pages and other online identities, millennials are comfortable with the notion of mixing and matching different elements of their persona, a trait that carries over into their shopping choices, according to analysts and academics. To reach this first generation of "digital natives," it's no longer enough for stores to offer a rack and a dressing room. "People are looking to create a unique identity," said Allen Adamson, an author and branding expert at Landor Associates. "They want to put together their own story rather than have someone else tell them." In addition to an inviting website and easy payment system, retailers are trying to make shopping more exciting for this over-stimulated generation. At H&amp;M's midtown Manhattan store, for example, shoppers can strut their stuff on the store's fashion walk and then possibly have their video selected to be displayed outside. Gap is stressing that same aspiration with its new "dress normal" ad campaign, which uses taglines such as "dress like no one's watching" and "simple clothes for you to complicate." Sales at Gap stores fell 5 percent in the last quarter. The company said the ad campaign is aimed at customers who want to "dress for themselves." That certainly describes Brianne Casey, a 24-year-old New Yorker, who studied marketing and now works as an assistant to a buyer for a retail chain. Casey said she shops at a variety of stores to get the best prices and follows fashion trends on blogs to see what's hot. But in the end, she said, "I like creating my own style."

Thomson ReutersA woman walks by the Family Dollar store in Arvada(Reuters) - U.S. retailer Dollar General Corp is preparing to go hostile as soon as this week in its bid to buy rival Family Dollar Stores, taking its $9.1 billion offer directly to shareholders after being spurned twice by its smaller rival, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.  Dollar General could launch a tender offer for Family Dollar as soon as Wednesday, these people said, asking not to be named because the matter is not public. Family Dollar, which already has a deal to sell to Dollar Tree Inc for $8.5 billion, has rejected Dollar General's unsolicited approaches citing antitrust risks. In its most recent offer made last week, Dollar General had added a $500 million break-up fee and increased the number of stores it is willing to sell to get antitrust approval to 1,500 from 700. Dollar General believes these new terms eliminated the antitrust risk for Family Dollar, people familiar with the matter said. But the rival rejected the sweetened bid, saying it did not give the company sufficient protection. Representatives for Dollar General declined to comment. Family Dollar could not be immediately reached for comment.

Thomson ReutersFiat Chief Executive Marchionne looks on during a meeting with Italian Prime Minister Renzi (not pictured) to mark the presentation of new "Jeep Renegade" car at Chigi palace, in RomeMILAN (Reuters) - Luca Cordero di Montezemolo will step down as chairman of Ferrari as of Oct. 13 and will be replaced by Sergio Marchionne, who also serves as the chief executive of parent group Fiat . The departure of Montezemolo, announced by Fiat on Wednesday, was widely expected after escalating clashes between the two executives over strategy and the role of the luxury sports car business within the Fiat group. Fiat shares were up 2.4 percent by 0721 GMT (3.21 a.m. EDT), against a 0.1 percent fall for Milan's blue-chip index . Montezemolo, Ferrari's chairman since 1991, has been wanting to keep Ferrari autonomous, while Marchionne has been pushing to better integrate the business within Fiat to boost the group's move into the premium end of the car market as it seeks to rival the likes of Volkswagen  and BMW . The Oct. 13 resignation date coincides with the day when Fiat, which owns 90 percent of Ferrari, plans to list Fiat Chrysler Automobiles in New York after completing a merger with its U.S. business and cementing a shift of the Italian group from its home for the past 115 years. "Ferrari will have an important role to play within the FCA Group in the upcoming flotation on Wall Street. This will open up a new and different phase, which I feel should be spearheaded by the CEO of the Group," Montezemolo said in a separate statement. Marchionne said that he and Montezemolo had discussed the future of Ferrari at length and that "our mutual desire to see Ferrari achieve its true potential on the (Formula One racing) track has led to misunderstandings, which became clearly visible over the last weekend". The Fiat CEO said on Sunday that the recent disappointing performance of Ferrari's Formula One racing team was "unacceptable" and that it was "absolutely non-negotiable" that Ferrari should win Formula One races Under Montezemolo's more than two decade-long tenure, Ferrari raced to the top of the Formula One grid, increased revenues tenfold and tripled sales volumes as the Italian family business grew into one of the world's most powerful brands.

Thomson ReutersA Panasonic Corp's lithium-ion battery is pictured with Tesla Motors logo in TokyoBy Sandra Chereb CARSON CITY Nev. (Reuters) - Nevada lawmakers are set to convene a special legislative session in Carson City on Wednesday to consider a package of tax breaks estimated at up to $1.3 billion aimed at cementing a deal with Tesla Motors Inc  for a $5 billion battery plant. Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval announced September 4 that the California-based electric car maker had chosen Nevada as the site of its lithium ion battery factory. Lawmakers said on Tuesday they were heading to the state capital, even though Sandoval had still not issued the formal proclamation outlining the parameters of the special session. "The governor has ordered us to the state Capitol," State Senator Kelvin Atkinson, a North Las Vegas Democrat, said on Twitter. Japan's Panasonic Corp  will produce lithium ion cells for battery packs and will fund part of the cost of the plant, which is considered an important part of Tesla's ambitions of taking on major automakers. California, Texas, Arizona and New Mexico were also in competition for the plant. The state of Nevada said it would give Tesla more than $1 billion in tax breaks and abatements over a 20-year period in a package subject to approval by the state's legislature. Tesla Chief Executive Officer and co-founder Elon Musk has said Nevada's offer to Tesla "was not the biggest incentive package" but said that the state was picked because it "can do things quickly" and "get things done". The electric car maker says the battery plant in Storey County, about 15 miles east of Reno, Nevada, will crank out cheaper and more efficient battery packs for Tesla's future cars, including the $35,000 Model 3 that is due in 2017. Specifics on the bills were not available on Tuesday. Critics argue the giveaways amount to corporate welfare and question the governor's claim that Nevada would reap $100 billion in economic benefits over 20 years.
