Yellen is highly skilled, seasoned and a veteran of the financial crisis.  She certainly does not want another one to occur on her watch as chair of the Federal Reserve. Any market calming effect will be short lived.  Markets are focused on the political fight and are also sensitive to the damage each day of the political fight does to the US economy.  Yellen knows this.  She cannot do anything about it except to proceed slowly on any tapering policy.  So Fed policy becomes more predictable with the announcement of her appointment while Congress and the White House continue to add fuel to the fire that burns the modern day version of Rome which we call Washington. We remain with a cash reserve on the sidelines.   We like Janet Yellen and wish her well.  She cannot fix the dysfunction at the other side of the Washington where the congressional fight with White House continues. 
APIn dueling press conferences on Tuesday, President Barack Obama accused House Republicans of "extortion" and hostage taking. House Speaker John Boehner said that Obama wanted Republicans to unconditionally surrender. And still, it looks like there's at least a small chance of a way out of the current mess in Washington. Both Obama and Boehner seemingly left the door open to a short-term fix, in which the debt ceiling is lifted and the government is reopened — alongside a House-Senate deal that would establish a negotiating panel on fiscal issues. Here's Obama, earlier on Tuesday (emphasis added): "If there's a way to solve this, it has to include reopening the government and saying America is not going to default; it's going to pay our bills. They can attach some process to that that gives them some certainty that in fact the things they're concerned about will be topics of negotiation, if my word's not good enough.  "But I've told them I'm happy to talk about it. But if they want to specify all the items that they think need to be topic of conversation, happy to do it. They'll want to say, you know, part of that process is, we're going to go through, line by line, all the aspects of the president's health care plan that we don't like, and we want the president to answer for those things, I'm happy to sit down with them for as many hours as they want. I won't let them gut a law that is going to make sure tens of millions of people actually get health care, but I'm happy to talk about it." Boehner didn't explicitly dismiss this idea in his press conference. And a "senior" House GOP source told CNN's Dana Bash that Republicans might be willing to jump on board with a short-term increase as long as Obama "agrees to use that time to negotiate." The extension could be for four to six weeks. There is still a lot to be worked out. For one, it's unclear if any clean debt-limit increase — even with the promise of negotiations — can pass through the GOP-controlled House. The White House also issued a veto threat to the GOP's plan to pass a bill that would establish a "negotiating team" among House and Senate Republicans and Democrats on the upcoming need to raise the debt ceiling. That's largely because the team would only recommend spending cuts from their negotiations, and wouldn't touch revenue. And the negotiations would be tied to the debt ceiling, something Obama won't accept. Right now, a short-term fix seems like the best way out of the mess — even if it's far from a certainty.
Earlier today, we learned that the National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB) small business optimism index slipped to 93.9 in September from 94.1 in August. But it's what they said about jobs continues to be encouraging. Here's Deutsche Bank's Joseph LaVorgna (emphasis added): According to the September results, the net percentage of small businesses planning to increase employment totaled +9% last month, down from a revised August reading of +10% (it had been initially reported at +16%) and in line with what was reported in July (+9%). Over the past three months, hiring intentions are at their highest reading since February 2008 (+10%). But as we can see in the chart below, the trend in hiring was pointing noticeably downward in early 2008. That is not the case presently, as hiring intentions are clearly rising. This improvement in labor market sentiment is also consistent with the ongoing decline in initial jobless claims, which have made a new cyclical low, even after adjusting for the distortion in California. Incidentally, the weekly claims data will continue to be reported during the government shutdown because the program is administered at the state level. What is our take-away from the NFIB? One, the improvement in hiring intentions hints that the slowdown in nonfarm payrolls seen through August, when the three-month moving average slowed to +148k from +200k earlier in the year, is temporary. Two, the NFIB data also suggest that the Affordable Care Act (i.e., ObamaCare) is at best having only a limited impact on small business hiring plans at least at the moment. Under the employer mandate of Obamacare, businesses employing 50 or more workers are forced to offer health insurance or pay a penalty of $2,000 per full-time worker (i.e., those working over 30 hours per week). Obamacare critics have warned that the new law would cause smaller businesses to cut back hiring and cut back hours. For the most part, the evidence has been inconclusive. Today's NFIB report offers more evidence that Obamacare's naysayers are wrong.
I visited the Googleplex today. The big one, in Mountain View. It's a lot bigger than I thought. In fact, it's so big, it's no mystery why Google has a boatload of those colorful Google Bikes all over campus. If Googlers had to walk from one building to another, they'd waste hours every day. I also saw a Google Self-Driving Car. It was driving around the Shoreline Amphitheater parking lot, which is next to the Googleplex. It didn't crash — at least not while I was watching. One thing I hadn't realized about those cars is that the camera thing on top actually whirls around at high speed, like a ship's radar antenna on steroids. And that makes sense. Because, as I understand it, the cars do "see," in part, by radar. I saw a Google soccer field. I saw roaming packs of Googlers. And I saw at least a dozen Google buses. Those things are huge. They're double-deckers (at least some of them). They have destination-names on the front, just like public buses. Judging by the random sampling I saw in only a few minutes, they seem to go pretty much everywhere: * Noe Valley (a hipster area of San Francisco) * Hayes (another hipster area of San Francisco — I lived there a thousand years ago, when I was a writing a crappy book about a year I spent teaching English in Japan. It wasn't a good book. I wrote in the mornings and then taught tennis in the afternoon to pay the bills...) * Santa Cruz (a city) * Berkeley (a city) * Etc. The Google buses were floating by all over the Googleplex. They have bike racks on the back. I watched one of them stop outside the YouTube building, where a dozen or so Googlers were waiting (see picture below.) And I thought, wow, it would be pretty cool to have a bus pick me up in my 'hood every day and take me to work an hour away — especially a bus with WiFi and a bike rack. And I also thought it would be pretty cool to run a company that was so rich that it could afford to buy buses to pick up the team in their 'hoods every day and drive them to and from work. And it would be cool!  Even if those buses have become so hated by people in San Francisco who aren't lucky enough to work at Google that some of them made a Google Bus pinata. Don't get me wrong — inequality sucks. It's one of the biggest problems facing our country. And we have to figure out a way to address it. But everyone has to get to work. And if each Google Bus carries 40 Googlers, that's 40 fewer cars on the roads. That's less traffic. And less gas consumption. And less pollution. And those things are good for everyone — even people without jobs to commute to. So here's to Google and their Google buses. Maybe someday Business Insider can get some!

APRep. Paul Ryan has a must-read op-ed in the Wall Street Journal tonight on ending the fiscal impasse in Washington. It's perhaps more notable for what it doesn't once mention — Obamacare — as what it eventually proposes. That omission seemed to ignite the ire of conservatives Tuesday night. The key proposition in Ryan's op-ed, though, is a trade of entitlement reform for repeal of the sequester cuts. From the op-ed: For my Democratic colleagues, the discretionary spending levels in the Budget Control Act are a major concern. And the truth is, there's a better way to cut spending. We could provide relief from the discretionary spending levels in the Budget Control Act in exchange for structural reforms to entitlement programs. Ryan also proposes a few ideas for entitlement reform — making wealthier Americans pay higher premiums for Medicare, reforming "Medigap" (Medicare supplement) plans to "encourage efficiency" and reduce costs, and asking federal employees to contribute more to their own retirement. Ryan's entry into the current debate is significant — until now, the former Republican vice presidential nominee had been almost entirely silent.  That said, it's not likely that the White House and President Barack Obama would accept this sort of deal without additional revenue included. And the White House has insisted that Obama won't negotiate with the threats of economic calamity hanging overhead. Moreover, this is a far cry from the debate that has produced the impasse that has incurred a federal government shutdown. That debate involved conservatives' insistence that any bill to fund the government stripped any funding for the Affordable Care Act. Three times in 10 days leading up to the eventual shutdown, the House inserted language into its version of a continuing resolution that stripped funding for or significantly altered certain portions of Obamacare. Because of that clear omission, Ryan's op-ed was immediately slammed by conservative groups that have led the "defund" charge. Here's Dan Holler, the communications director for Heritage Action, taking a jab at Ryan on Twitter: much like White House press, Paul Ryan doesn't mention Obamacare in WSJ oped. #shutdown http://t.co/zo5sI7yk6p There is one big word missing from this op-ed. It's start with an O and ends with BAMACARE http://t.co/r1cYgjWEL5
Federal Reserve Vice Chair Janet Yellen is about to be nominated for Fed Chair. "Yellen will not only be the first woman Fed chair, she also will be the oldest on appointment," noted Lorcan Roche Kelly. Since everyone loves trivia, here's a ton of it. From Bank of America Merrill Lynch's U.S. economics team, here's a list of where everyone on the Federal Open Market Committee went to school, what degree they got, and when they graduated. Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Minutes ago, the White House announced that President Barack Obama would officially nominate Federal Reserve Vice Chair Janet Yellen for Fed Chair on Wednesday, October 8. Yellen is considered a dove, which means she is more likely to keep monetary policy loose and easy. Now that we are almost certain to have Yellen at the Fed's helm, an uncertainty premium has been removed from the market. And the prospect for easy monetary policy is being seen as bullish for stocks. Dow futures are up by around 30 points in the wake of the Yellen announcement. And as expected, the U.S. dollar is down slightly and gold is up around $2 per ounce. Here's a look at Dow futures via FinViz: FinViz
BAM Putting on an opera based on a true story about a stripper who married an octogenarian billionaire and became a celebrity was a last ditch effort to attract a new audience to the New York City Opera. In some ways it paid off. "Anna Nicole" drew a large turnout, including some sold-out shows and was hailed (in its London premier) as "a weirdly inspired work... engrossing, outrageous, entertaining and, ultimately, deeply moving" by New York Times critic Anthony Tommasini. But it wasn't enough to save the opera, which filed for bankruptcy last week. In fact, "Anna Nicole" may have ruined the best chance to save the opera by scaring away major donor David H. Koch, according to a report about the final days by Michael Cooper and Robin Pogrebin in the Times. See, late billionaire J. Howard Marshall II was a big investor in Koch Industries, and his family hates Anna Nicole Smith. From the Times: [Opera general manager George Steel] spent a night at the opera last month with David H. Koch, the billionaire who paid to renovate the opera’s former home at Lincoln Center, and who remained one of its biggest donors even after the company left the redone theater to save money. But there was a hitch. The opera they saw, Mark-Anthony Turnage’s “Anna Nicole,” tells the more-or-less true life story of Anna Nicole Smith, a former Playboy model who married an octogenarian oil tycoon, J. Howard Marshall II, and who waged a fierce battle with his heirs over his estate after he died. Mr. Marshall, it turned out, had owned 16 percent of the Koch family’s business, Koch Industries. When Mr. Steel asked Mr. Koch if he could make further gifts to save the company, Mr. Koch demurred, telling Mr. Steel that the Marshall family might be less than pleased, according to a person familiar with their conversation. And so no one came to save the "People's Opera," which was founded in 1943 with a mission to provide world-class opera at affordable prices. New York City opera lives on at the more expensive Metropolitan Opera.
"Maybe I actually am right," Krugman wrote back in April, "and maybe the other side actually does contain a remarkable number of knaves and fools. ... Look at the results: again and again, people on the opposite side prove to have used bad logic, bad data, the wrong historical analogies, or all of the above. I'm Krugtron the Invincible!" That last allusion is to the 1980s science fiction superhero, Voltron. The resemblance between Krugman and Voltron was suggested by one of the gaggle of bloggers who are to Krugman what Egyptian plovers are to crocodiles. Yesterday one of these thought, wrongly, that he had caught me out. Unwisely, the crocodile snapped its jaws shut. As a Princeton professor and Nobel Prize winner, Krugman is indeed widely believed to be intellectually invincible. He himself acknowledges having made only two mistakes, both predating the crisis: the impact of information technology on productivity, which he underestimated, and the significance of the federal deficits of the Bush administration, which he overestimated. "In the Great Recession and aftermath, however, I went with [my] models -- and they worked!" "Let those who are without error cast the first stone," Krugman wrote back in 2010. Unfortunately, this is not an injunction he himself has heeded. Repeatedly, over the last five years, he has heaped opprobrium on others. His latest performance is characteristic; perhaps not quite intentionally he even refers to "my own unpleasantness with Ferguson". Let us leave -- for the moment -- the question of the future size of the federal debt, which I have dealt with elsewhere and shall return to in a subsequent article. My purpose here is simply to challenge Krugman's right to behave in this way. Even if he were nearly always right, there would be no justification for his lack of civility. But he is not nearly always right. There is therefore no justification for his unshakeable certainty either. Krugman reserves a special contempt for people who, in his words, "take a position and refuse to alter that position no matter how strongly the evidence refutes it, who continue to insist that they have The Truth despite being wrong again and again." He calls this "derping." The awkward thing for Krugman is that "being wrong again and again" perfectly characterizes his own commentary on what proved to be one of the crucial issues of the financial crisis: whether or not Europe's monetary union would survive it. To begin with, Krugman was blithely confident that Europe would weather the economic storm better than the United States. On January 11, 2008, he hailed it as "The Comeback Continent": ... Since 2000, employment has actually grown a bit faster in Europe than in the United States ... If you think Europe is a place where lots of able-bodied adults just sit at home collecting welfare checks, think again. ... Europe's economy looks a lot better now - both in absolute terms and compared with our economy - than it did a decade ago. Krugman explained Europe's comeback in terms of "deregulation", a more competitive broadband market than the U.S., "strong social safety nets" and "very high taxes." On May 19, 2008, after a visit to Berlin, he even told his faithful readers: "I have seen the future, and it works ... in the heart of 'old Europe'." (Admittedly this column was a standard "peak oil" piece, exhorting to Americans to have German-style cars and public transport, as opposed to, say, developing new technology to unlock hitherto inaccessible domestic supplies of oil and natural gas.) Finally, in December 2008, Krugman woke up to the fact that the "Comeback Continent" was in fact an "economic mess." But what kind of mess? No, not the mess of excessively leveraged and effectively insolvent banks that had maxed out on CDOs, bubbly real estate and Club Med government bonds. The mess Krugman discerned was the failure of the German government to see "the need for a large, pan-European fiscal stimulus." The main thing, he wrote in March 2009, was not to make the mistake of thinking that "big welfare states are ... the cause of Europe's current crisis. In fact ... they're actually a mitigating factor." It was a theme he returned to when he and I debated the crisis in New York three months later, when he argued that "the human suffering [was] going to be much greater on this side of the Atlantic" because of Europe's "strong social safety net." Even in January 2010 he was still insisting that: The real lesson from Europe is actually the opposite of what conservatives claim: Europe is an economic success, and that success shows that social democracy works. ... taking the longer view, the European economy works; it grows; it's as dynamic, all in all, as our own. All of this sheds (to say the least) interesting light on Krugman's boast in an interview in March of this year to have been one of the few commentators who had "predicted the unfolding economic disaster in Europe." This is by no means the only retrospective prediction Krugman has ever made, but it is surely the most shameless. The European crisis had in fact begun in December 2009, while Krugman was still celebrating Europe's economic success, when the newly elected Socialist government in Greece revealed the full extent of the country's fiscal crisis. The Invincible Krugtron was on the scene in a flash -- well, two months later: "Lack of fiscal discipline isn't the whole, or even the main, source of Europe's troubles -- not even in Greece. ... The real story behind the euromess lies not in the profligacy of politicians but in the arrogance of elites ..." Wait, what about the Comeback Continent, where social democracy was the future that worked? Never mind about that, there's a crisis and Krugtron's help is urgently needed! And boy did he help. The question of whether the euro was going to blow up imminently was surely the biggest call of the last few years. Fear of another Lehman-style shock froze credit markets and paralyzed policymakers. Was this just an outside risk over the long term, or a disaster that was almost upon us? Faithful readers of Krugman's New York Times column knew the answer. By my reckoning, Krugman wrote about the imminent break-up of the euro at least eleven times between April 2010 and July 2012: 1. April 29, 2010: "Is the euro itself in danger? In a word, yes. If European leaders don't start acting much more forcefully, providing Greece with enough help to avoid the worst, a chain reaction that starts with a Greek default and ends up wreaking much wider havoc looks all too possible." 2. May 6, 2010: "Many observers now expect the Greek tragedy to end in default; I'm increasingly convinced that they're too optimistic, that default will be accompanied or followed by departure from the euro." 3. September 11, 2011: "the euro is now at risk of collapse. ... the common European currency itself is under existential threat." 4. October 23, 2011: "[the] monetary system ... has turned into a deadly trap. ... it's looking more and more as if the euro system is doomed." 5. November 10, 2011: "This is the way the euro ends ... Not long ago, European leaders were insisting that Greece could and should stay on the euro while paying its debts in full. Now, with Italy falling off a cliff, it's hard to see how the euro can survive at all." 6. March 11, 2012: "Greece and Ireland ... had and have no good alternatives short of leaving the euro, an extreme step that, realistically, their leaders cannot take until all other options have failed - a state of affairs that, if you ask me, Greece is rapidly approaching." 7. April 15, 2012: "What is the alternative? ... Exit from the euro, and restoration of national currencies. You may say that this is inconceivable, and it would indeed be a hugely disruptive event both economically and politically. But continuing on the present course, imposing ever-harsher austerity on countries that are already suffering Depression-era unemployment, is what's truly inconceivable." 8. May 6, 2012: "One answer - an answer that makes more sense than almost anyone in Europe is willing to admit - would be to break up the euro, Europe's common currency. Europe wouldn't be in this fix if Greece still had its drachma, Spain its peseta, Ireland its punt, and so on, because Greece and Spain would have what they now lack: a quick way to restore cost-competitiveness and boost exports, namely devaluation." 9. May 17, 2012: "Apocalypse Fairly Soon ... Suddenly, it has become easy to see how the euro - that grand, flawed experiment in monetary union without political union - could come apart at the seams. We're not talking about a distant prospect, either. Things could fall apart with stunning speed, in a matter of months." 10. June 10, 2012: "utter catastrophe may be just around the corner." 11. July 29, 2012: "Will the euro really be saved? That remains very much in doubt." His most recent wrong call was that it was "a real possibility" that Cyprus would be "forced off the euro in the next few days." That was in March of this year -- shortly before a new Cypriot government reached an agreement for yet another bailout that kept it in the Eurozone. True, Krugman was rarely unequivocal in predicting a euro breakup. Especially at the beginning of the crisis, he hedged, sometimes assigning "more or less even odds" to "a breakup of the euro, with major players, not just Greece, being forced out." That was in an interview with Playboy (seriously) back in February 2012. By May, however, he was more certain. While conceding to the Washington Post (presumably in jest) that his view of the euro's survival "depends on my mood," he stated: "As a matter of substantive economics? It's doomed." His confidence growing, he told the Belgian paper De Tijd: "I think Greece is too far-gone. I don't see a realistic possibility of making the euro work for them now." Radio Free Europe listeners were told that same month that a Greek exit was "probably something that will take place in months." "Mr. Krugman, does Greece have to leave the euro zone?" he was asked by Der Spiegel. "Yes," he replied. "I don't see too much alternative now." "I don't think they can save Greece," he told the Financial Times. By now the Invincible Krugtron was on a roll. "Something has to happen and in the end it does have to be a Greek exit," he told a reporter from the Independent. "I'd be astonished if they can go more than two years without leaving. I'd be astonished if they could go even one year." Viewers of the BBC were next: Krugman: I believe Greece will and must leave the euro. I think there is no alternative. BBC: When do you think it will happen? Krugman: It could happen in a few weeks in the next election of Greece [which was on June 17]. On more than one occasion -- on PBS in June last year for example, and in an interview the following month with Business Insider -- the formulation was conditional: if the Germans did not tolerate higher inflation, "then the euro will break up." But by September it was back to inevitable Greek exit: "I cannot see how this country can remain in the euro," he told L'Express. "It is practically impossible." In all, I count a total of twenty-two statements of this sort, attaching probabilities of 50 percent and above to the scenario of one or more countries leaving the euro. Now, I happen to be rather a euro-skeptic myself. I opposed the creation of the euro and predicted at the outset that the experiment of monetary union without fiscal integration would ultimately degenerate. But today, as you may have noticed, the euro is still intact. Indeed, the Eurozone has two more members than when the crisis began and in January will acquire yet another, Latvia. That is not to say that it won't fall apart eventually. But for the foreseeable future that remains a much lower probability scenario than its survival. I don't know which particular model Paul Krugman was using in the summer of 2012, but it certainly did rather a bad job of predicting what would happen. I laughed out loud at his recent lame excuse that his model couldn't have been expected to predict the action of the European Central Bank. What an awesome model: one that predicts everything about a monetary union except the action of the monetary authority. Besides its wrongness, the other striking feature of Krugman's commentary on the euro is the vitriol he has directed against those struggling to cope with the crisis. In December 2011, he called the then Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti "delusional." In March of this year, incredibly, he appeared to liken the Finnish Vice President of the European Commission, Olli Rehn, to a cockroach. Some people, I have come to realize, are intimidated by this lack of civility. But I am with Dilbert. It's simply absurd for this man to accuse others of "derping," a childish neologism meaning -- in case you've forgotten -- to "take a position and refuse to alter that position ... despite being wrong again and again." "I like to think," Krugman wrote on August 14, "that if I had been proved ... utterly wrong ... I'd have had the strength of character to admit it and question my premises. But I don't know for sure, and with some luck I'll never find out." Now that I have shown Krugtron the Invincible to have been utterly and repeatedly wrong about the euro, I look forward to reading his admission of error. To be precise, I would like to see him admit that he got the biggest call of the last several years dead wrong, again and again and again. Not only should he admit his mistake, but he should also apologize to the millions of people who have suffered as a result of it. Or does he believe that his numerous, widely read predictions of imminent currency break-up had no impact whatever on the expectations of European investors and consumers?

REUTERS/ Robert GalbraithJanet Yellen, vice chair of the Board of Governors of the U.S. Federal Reserve SystemPresident Barack Obama will announce the nomination Janet Yellen to be the next chair of the Federal Reserve on Wednesday, a White House official said. Assuming she is confirmed (which should be easy) the post will make Yellen the most powerful woman in American history, as the Fed has tremendous independence and influence on the US and world economies. Obama will announce her nomination Wednesday at 3 p.m. during an event in the East Room of the White House, the official said. Yellen, the current Fed vice chair, would succeed Ben Bernanke, who will appear at the White House event on Wednesday. If she is confirmed by the Senate, she would be the first female chair of the Fed. Yellen's nomination would finish off months of public speculation that centered on whether Obama would nominate Yellen or Larry Summers, a former economic adviser with whom Obama is close. In mid-September, after facing resistance from liberal Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee, Summers withdrew his candidacy, citing the expectation of a potential "acrimonious" confirmation process. Yellen's nomination comes in the face of fiscal battles in Washington.  On Wednesday, the federal government shutdown entered into its eighth full day on Tuesday, with no immediate end in sight. And Congress needs to raise the debt ceiling by Oct. 17 — nine days away — to avoid a potential default.  Yellen has been second-in-command at the Fed since 2010. Senators immediately said they expected her to be confirmed without drama. "She’s an excellent choice and I believe she’ll be confirmed by a wide margin," said Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.).
REUTERS/Daniel MunozMohamed El-Erian, CEO of PIMCOThe oncoming October 17 U.S. debt ceiling continues to go unresolved. And the investing world is trying to make sense of it all. Business Insider recently had a Q&amp;A with PIMCO's Mohamed El-Erian about the matter.Â  Here's what he said. What does the debt limit fiasco mean for the U.S. economy? The last thing Americaâ€™s still-sluggish recovery needs is a sinkhole of our politicians' own making. Yet this is what it would get if Congress does not lift the debt ceiling in a timely manner. While we think that, when push comes to shove, our politicians will come to their senses, we have analyzed the possible consequences of a failure to do so. The bottom line is a simple one: cascading financial market dysfunction, an economy back in recession, higher unemployment, and greater global economic and financial instability. What does it mean for the markets? Equities? U.S. Treasuries? Here one has to differentiate very carefully the different stages of a possible, though unlikely, huge political debacle. First there would be October 17th, the date that Treasury Secretary Lew specified when the U.S. would run out of legal debt issuance space. In the run up to that date, equity and other risk markets would likely get increasingly nervous. In the event, October 17th would unlikely prove to be a hard deadline. Instead, between the cash on hand and some spending and revenue flexibility, the Treasury would probably be able to make it to the end of the month without incurring payments arrears. Risk assets would likely come under greater pressure, reacting to every signal out of DC. Meanwhile, normal market functioning, including the important repo function, would be subject to growing strain and stress. In the weeks that follow, the Treasury Department would be forced into a very delicate and challenging process of payment prioritization or delaying some payments outright. In either case, officials would probably seek to protect to the maximum extent possible the full faith and credit of the nation. As other spending commitments are cut very hard, equities would sell off significantly on concern of a major recession while Treasuries would likely out-perform. If this process is drawn out â€“ and, remember please, we believe that the probability of getting to this stage is very, very low â€“ the U.S. couldÂ  default on debt payments. While it would be doing so due to the lack of political willingness rather than financial ability, the result would be the same: The world would most likely be facing the likelihood of a great depression. Fortunately, all this can, should and likely will be avoided when the minority in the Republican party realizes that taking the debt ceiling hostage can have a catastrophic impact on current and future generations. What does it do for America's credibility to the rest of the world? In addition to great economic damage at home, Americaâ€™s standing in the global economy would be hard hit. Countries would likely look to build an alternative (or alternatives) to the dollar-centric global financial system. This would undermine the substantial benefits and influence we derive from having the dollar serve as the worldâ€™s reserve currency, and from other countries out-sourcing a part of their financial intermediation process to what is the most sophisticated, deepest and, until recently, most predictable financial system. Finally, and in addition to harming our economic interest, all this would undermine our global political standing and national security interests. Could this be worse than the global financial crisis triggered by Lehmanâ€™s disorderly default 5 years ago? Yes, much worse. And the sooner Congress realizes this, the higher the probability that America would side-step a totally avoidable crisis of historic proportions.
Julio Aguiar on www.flickr.com creative commonsSAO PAULO, Brazil — The dreaded default notices come in two forms: postcard-size white envelopes, unassuming in their diminution, and letter-size dark gray ones. Gray like storm clouds. Or gunmetal. In the Paraisopolis favela, or slum, in Sao Paulo, Edivaldo Ferreira collects the letters for his neighbors. His small pet store is a de facto sorting office for local mail carriers wary of ducking into the slum alleys. They give the letters and bills to Ferreira, who stacks them in an old birdseed box behind the counter. Increasingly these days, the mail consists of default letters. Everyone in the favela is up to their neck in debt, the pet store owner said. Sometimes people don’t check their mail for a few days. They scurry past quickly, avoiding his shouts about the envelopes waiting for them. In the heyday of Brazil’s so-called economic miracle of the 2000s, the country gorged on debt. Brazil’s banks lowered their underwriting standards, making credit suddenly easily available to new segments of the population. And, as millions rose out of poverty, they turned to plastic and alluring installment plans to finance new homes, cars and goods. Then, as the South American dynamo retreated in 2011 and 2012, consumer credit defaults spiked, rising by more than 20 percent in the first six months of 2011, according to Seresa Experian, a ratings agency. The letters in Ferreira’s birdseed box started to dish out the shameful status of “nome sujo,” or dirty name, to favela residents, whose bad reputation left them blacklisted from the credit market. Interviews with several families in Sao Paulo, Brazil’s largest city, suggested the guilt of that debt is mounting. It’s now adding to pressure on a population seething at political corruption, seemingly endless inflation and lavish spending on sports venues for next year’s World Cup and the 2016 Olympics. For those struggling to make ends meet, a dirty name was just one more reason to hit the streets in protest last June, when an estimated million angry residents jammed onto cities across the country in marches that went on for days. “People in Brazil find that they now have an amount of debt that’s unmanageable,” said Lewis Mandell, a professor emeritus at the State University of New York at Buffalo, who has written several books on the history of the credit card industry. “All across society, people are losing confidence.” The debt trap reaches far beyond the favela. According to a June report from the International Monetary Foundation, credit defaults in Brazil have been increasing since mid-2010. The flood of dirty names has come with other signs of financial stress, such as more bounced checks and missed car loan payments, the report states. Madalena Alexandre da Silva is one of millions of Brazilians struggling to keep her name clean. The maid and mother-of-four recently won a government raffle to buy a 450-square-foot apartment, which she shares with three of her children. Da Silva’s 1,700 reais-a-month ($768) salary is the only income supporting that household and her fourth child, who now has a child of her own and lives with the father’s family. The mortgage on da Silva’s apartment eats up 420 reais ($190) of her salary. The rest goes to four things: food, bills, bus fares and debt. Like many of her friends, da Silva has built up credit card debt. In total, she owes 3,000 reais ($1,356) to a local bank and a supermarket, she said. Da Silva got the cards a few months ago, when she was unemployed. She acknowledged she shouldn’t have borrowed “pretend money,” as she called it. Her faith in the system to provide for her children was nonexistent, she said, so she turned to plastic for help. Now she’s working and struggling to pay them off. “It’s not much for people who have something,” da Silva said. “But if you have nothing …” The debt would be growing, swallowing her up, she said. But she managed to negotiate with the card companies, setting up nine monthly payments to be rid of the debt forever. Bitter debt hangover Economists have been sounding the alarm on Brazilian consumer debt. The country’s household debt as a percentage of disposable income reached a record high of 44.8 percent in June, according to Moody’s ratings agency. That was more than double where it stood in June 2005, when the figure was 20.06 percent. Debt is just one of the hangovers from 10 years of booming economic times in Brazil, said Edmund Amann, head of economics at Manchester University in the United Kingdom, who studies Brazil’s economy. While the economy has recently showed signs of picking up again, Amann said the last two years have been tough on Brazilians from all strata of society, and especially for those in the lower portion of Brazil's massive middle class. A devalued currency has pushed unemployment and inflation up, he said. And economic bottlenecks and an infrastructure that needs government investment have dragged Brazil down. Professor Paulo Roberto Feldmann, of the faculty of economics, business and accounting of the University of Sao Paulo, agreed. “What is really problematic and in my opinion is a big issue is the debt of families,” Feldmann said. “Brazilian families, at this moment are really in a delicate situation.” As such, letters like those piling up in the seed box in Ferreira’s pet shop provide more than just bad news for their recipients. They’re an extra turn of the screws to a population already wound up tight and ready to break. This article is part of an in-depth series on how Brazil's harsh household economics spurred a mass protest movement and still bubble under the surface of Latin America's biggest nation. http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/americas/brazil/131007/sao-paulo-household-debt-credit-card-brazilian-economy

Donors pledge up to $10 million to fund Head Start programs during government shutdown ATLANTA (AP) â€” A donation of up to $10 million from two philanthropists will help keep Head Start programs running during the federal government shutdown, National Head Start Association officials said Monday evening. Laura and John Arnold's donation will help serve more than 7,000 at-risk children while the government shutdown continues, NHSA officials said in a release. The Arnolds, of Houston, co-chair The Arnold Foundation, a philanthropic organization that was established in 2008. Laura Arnold is an ex-oil company executive and John Arnold is an investor. Head Start programs in Georgia, Alabama, Connecticut, Florida, South Carolina and Missouri were closed at the end of the first week of the shutdown, NHSA officials said. The programs â€”which are run by the Department of Health and Human Services and focus on early education programs for low-income children â€” have been allocated federal grant funding. However, administrators are temporarily blocked from renewing their funding because of the stalemate in Washington. "This hasn't really happened since the mid-90s, and I'm not so sure current programs had really thought about this happening before," said Georgia Department of Early Care and Learning spokesman Reg Griffin. "We did everything we could in terms of Georgia's pre-k program to try to reach out and help out in any way we could from an instructional standpoint," Griffin said, adding that staffing issues for the programs are handled on the federal level. The shutdown is impacting one Gainesville-based nonprofit that serves more than 1,100 Georgia students in more than 50 classrooms throughout northern Georgia, Griffin said. He added that his agency heard stories of hardship from parents who were scrambling to find childcare services that would allow them to stay at work after being told to keep their children at home this week. National Head Start Association Executive Director Yasmina Vinci called the Arnolds' donation selfless, and said the program is grateful they stepped forward to keep classrooms open. "The bottom line, however, is that angel investors like the Arnolds cannot possibly offer a sustainable solution to the funding crisis threatening thousands of our poorest children," Vinci said in a statement. "Our elected officials simply must find a fiscal solution that protects, preserves and promotes the promise that quality early learning opportunities like Head Start offer to nearly one million at-risk children each year."

C-SPANSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) plans to bring up a 'clean' debt limit increase on Tuesday, even though it's not clear that Democrats can pick up the six Republicans they would need to reach the 60-vote threshold to pass such a bill. But a senior Senate Democratic aide told Business Insider that some Senate Democrats are "rumbling" about another route to passage: Ruling that the Senate's 60-vote threshold is unconstitutional and passing the bill with a simple majority. "There are rumblings within the caucus, but no serious discussions yet," said the aide, when asked if Democrats might make the rule change often known as the "nuclear option." Senate Democrats have previously discussed making this rule change, most recently in June during a controversy over stalled executive branch nominations. But proposals to use the "nuclear option" have been stalled by opposition from Republicans and a handful of Senate Democrats, including Carl Levin (Mich.), according to the Washington Post. If Levin and other reluctant Democrats are ever going to be convinced to support a rule change on filibusters, the debt ceiling seems like the optimal scenario: A situation where Republican opposition is especially irresponsible and Senate action could pressure the House to take action to save the U.S. economy from serious damage.

Why Advisors Need To Turn To A Flat-Fee System (The Wall Street Journal) Advisors should consider moving to a flat fee system to lower client headcount, writes Bernard A. Unger of New York-based Unger Financial Network, in a new Wall Street Journal column. This is because advisors often spend 75% of their time on "marketing and acquiring new clients," when they should be spending that time with their clients instead.Â  "There is a top-down problem in the industry where large broker dealers expect their advisers to meet minimum production requirements through commissions. Not only do these commissions create conflicts of interest, but advisers are left with no choice but to continually try to gain new clients to meet their minimums--leaving them with less time to spend with their existing clients. "The same argument can be made for advisers who charge a fee that is a percentage of assets under management. You end up constantly looking for clients to increase the assets you manage. "If advisers instead worked with a set number of clients who were charged a flat fee that met those minimum earning amounts, then they wouldn't have to keep looking for clients and spend so much time marketing." BOB DOLL: Advisors Should Turn To Dividend Growers (FA Mag)  Speaking at IMCA's annual conference in Chicago, Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management suggested that advisors should focus on stocks that can grow dividends rather than those that already pay high dividends. Doll pointed out that dividend-paying stocks have performed well in recent years because they have "bond-like characteristics," reports Evan Simonoff at FA Mag.Â  Doll said he has a dividend portfolio in which companies are increasing dividend payouts at 21% a year. This compares with two-thirds of dividend-paying stocks that increase their payouts at an annual rate of 5% or less. Embracing more dividend growing stocks will earn a higher total return as the stock price appreciates. Wells Fargo Gets 2 Teams With Almost $500 Million In Assets (Investment News) Two teams of advisors managing almost $500 million in clients' assets have joined Wells Fargo, according to Investment News. John Phillips, Darrell Jones and Scott Dickerson joined from UBS Wealth Management Americas, where they had $219 million in assets and $1.98 million in fees and other revenue. Meanwhile,Â  father-son duo Michael and Wes Climer joined from The Climer Wealth Management Group where they managed $220 million in assets and drew $1 million in fees and other revenue. Three Wall Street Strategists Explain What Investors Are Missing Right Now (Business Insider) At the Big Picture Conference today, hosted by Ritholtz Wealth Management, Josh Brown posed the question: "what are investors missing from the big market narrative right now?" Art Hogan, chief strategist at Lazard Capital, Dan Greenhaus, chief strategist at BTIG, and Jeffrey Kleintop chief strategist at LPL Financial were on hand to answer the question. Hogan said the American investor is missing out on opportunities outside the U.S. Meanwhile, Kleintop said investors going the "passive route" are going to miss opportunities outside the U.S. because it is difficult to get them without an active manager. "I get that active management hasn't worked in a while," he continued, "but I think so many investors are going to be behind the curve on this... in bonds and equities." Finally, BTIG's Greenhaus added that the Fed will have to unwind but that we are in an unprecedented situation. No one knows how this will happen, therefore, this is definitely something investors are missing. In A Few Months, The Stock Market Will Drop 15%, Then Go Nowhere For Years (Societe Generale) In recent weeks, Wall Street has been raising its S&amp;P 500 year-end targets.Â  The median 2014 year-end target for the index, according to a Bloomberg poll of Wall Street equity strategists is 1900. Societe Generale's asset allocation team expects the S&amp;P 500 to be at 1600 by year-end but isÂ  calling for a 15% correction in the stock market in Q1 2014.Â  "SG economists expect the January FOMC meeting to be the most likely timeframe for tapering. They look for the first move to be $20bn (instead of the $5-10bn previously expected by the market). "We expect the drop to accelerate at the start of 2014 as the market starts pricing in the end of asset purchases (i.e. well before the marketâ€™s Fed tapering expectation). The S&amp;P 500 should dip to 1450 on our estimates, down c.15% from the peak. "In the two to three years that follow, the U.S. equity index should remain relatively flat, burdened by higher yields (rate hikes in mid-2015), a higher U.S. dollar and limited earnings growth (Return on Equity is already high), but supported by better economic prospects and a new shareholder value cycle, staving off a bear market."
newmoney.govBen Franklin is about to cause a lot more headaches than you might expect in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang. The Federal Reserve on Tuesday began circulating a redesign of a US currency note that may be the most counterfeited monetary unit in the world: the $100 bill. Graced with Mr. Franklin’s bemused gaze on one side and Philadelphia’s Independence Hall on the other, the bill is the first new version of the C-note to be distributed by US monetary administrators in a decade. The note features a woven “3-D security ribbon” running vertically along the left side of Franklin’s face, with liberty bells that turn into 100s as you move the bill side to side. It also has a liberty bell in an inkwell that shifts in color as you tilt it. These changes add to other long-standing security features, like microscopic text woven into Franklin’s colonial collar and bordering the golden feather. "The new design incorporates security features that make it easier to authenticate, but harder to replicate," Federal Reserve Board Gov. Jerome H. Powell said in a statement. "As the new note transitions into daily transactions, the user-friendly security features will allow the public to more easily verify its authenticity." The Fed, along with the Treasury Department, the Secret Service and other agencies, has been redesigning all American currency bills since 2003, in an effort to stay ahead of counterfeiters, whose work has gotten easier as desktop publishing software has gotten more powerful and laser printers and photocopiers more capable. While currency counterfeiting may be known in the popular imagination as the work of backroom, ink-stained criminals, impoverished North Korea has long been known for its creative efforts to generate badly-needed hard currency. The totalitarian state has been all but quarantined from the global economy, isolated by sanctions and other measures to punish it for its nuclear programs and missile proliferation efforts. A combination of famine and floods in the 1990s that may have killed as much as 10 percent of the population, combined with the sharp post-Cold War decrease in aid from Moscow and Beijing, brought the Kim regime to the point of desperation, and prompted some tinkering with the Korean currency, the won, that only worsened matters for average Koreans. Even before the devastating famine, counterfeiting a variety of goods was central to revenue generation, helping to build a “palace economy” to ensure the loyalty of North Korea’s elites, says Sung-Yoon Lee, a Korean expert and assistant professor at The Fletcher School at Tufts University. “North Korea is unique in that it is the only country in the world to manufacture cigarettes, drugs like Viagra, hard currency; this is an essential instrument of regime preservation,” Mr. Lee says. “The regime relies on criminal activities, because it has no other means for generating revenue,” he says. North Korean forging prowess is so advanced that US law enforcement officials have dubbed the fake, “nearly perfect” $100 bills “supernotes.” According to a 2009 Congressional Research Service report, at least $45 million in supernotes of North Korean origin have been detected in circulation, and Pyongyang may earn between $15 million and $25 million a year from counterfeiting. North Korean diplomats often play roles in getting fake bills into circulation, lugging suitcases packed with bad money to their home embassies, then spending the bills in small, innocuous amounts in stores, casinos, restaurants or elsewhere. According to the Korean newspaper Chosun Ilbo, one North Korean embassy in Eastern Europe generated US$30 million by exchanging counterfeit notes a year. Lee added that it was only a matter of time before the North Koreans mastered the new design. In the meantime, sham Marlboros and other cigarette brands were likely to remain a more lucrative means for revenue-generation: “You just put wrap up some tobacco in paper, put them in boxes and ship them out. No one can tell,” he says. “The revenue is pretty sweet. With fake $100 bills you have to be careful, especially when government officials are using them abroad, since they’re being watched all the time.”
APSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.) will introduce a bill later Tuesday that would permit a "clean" increase in the nation's debt ceiling. The bill would extend the nation's borrowing authority through the end of 2014, past the midterm elections. It is a clean increase without any policy riders attached, a Senate Democratic aide told Business Insider. The first key vote for cloture on the bill could come as soon as Thursday. If Republicans use Senate procedure to string out the process, itÂ could lead to a final vote right up against an Oct. 17 deadline.Â  The Democratic aide said that Senate Democrats were still working on getting enough votes for to break a filibuster. If all 52 Democrats and two independents vote for the measure â€” something of which Democrats say they're confident â€” Democrats would need six Republicans to vote for the bill. The aide mentioned GOP Sens. Thad Cochran (Miss.), Mark Kirk (Ill.), and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) as Republicans that have previously said they could vote for a clean increase. But so far, there are "no commitments yet," the aide said. Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) have also expressed openness to a clean debt limit increase in recent days, according to press reports. Reid's plan on the debt ceiling was hatched Monday, afterÂ House Speaker John Boehner's spokesman issued a statement saying the House won't take up a "clean" debt limit increase because itÂ can't pass the Senate. Senate Democrats think it can, and they think it would put House Republicans in the awkward position of either having toÂ pass a similar increase or take responsibility when the limit is reached on or around Oct. 17.

Speaker.govA defiant House Speaker John Boehner said that "there's going to be a negotiation" on the debt ceiling, dismissing President Barack Obama's press conference earlier Tuesday as a request for "unconditional surrender" from Republicans. Obama signaled Tuesday that he would be open to a deal that would reopen the government and raise the debt ceiling while allowing for negotiations between the two parties. "The president said today if there's unconditional surrender by Republicans, he'll sit down and talk to us," Boehner said. "That's not the way our government works." Boehner's press conference followed a day full of back-and-forths between him and Obama.  Obama phoned Boehner on Tuesday morning, when he said that he wouldn't negotiate with the threat of a shutdown and economic calamity hanging overhead. He repeated that sentiment in a press conference Tuesday afternoon.  Shortly after Obama's hour-plus-long press conference concluded, Boehner announced a press conference of his own. His message to Obama: You're going to negotiate. "The long and short of it is, there's going to be a negotiation," he added. The federal government shutdown entered into its eighth full day on Tuesday, with no immediate end in sight. And Congress needs to raise the debt ceiling by Oct. 17 — nine days away — to avoid a potential default. Noon on Tuesday marked the halfway point — 8.5 days — between the start of the shutdown and the debt-ceiling deadline.
REUTERS/Shannon StapletonYum! Brands just announced Q3 earnings. The company reported adjusted earnings of $0.85 per share, on revenue of $3.47 billion. This missed expectations for adjusted earnings of $0.92 per share, on revenue of $3.52 billion. Same-store sales in China were down 11% in Q3, slightly below expectations for a 10.5% fall. But in September, China comp sales fell 11%, against expectations for a 5.7% fall. Yum derives a large part of its revenue from China, so investors watch for clues on the health of the Chinese consumer. CEO David Novak said "we remain confident sales will fully recover from the adverse publicity surrounding the December poultry supply incident." Yum was caught in a scandal, after the Shanghai Food and Drug Administration found that a chicken supplier to Yum from 2010 - 2011 had supplied chickens with high levels of antibiotics. Here's their revised guidance: "Based on KFC China sales for September, it is now unlikely China Division same-store sales will be positive for the fourth quarter. Given lower-than-expected China sales and a higher-than-expected full-year tax rate, the Company now estimates a high-single to low-double-digit full-year EPS decline versus prior year, excluding Special Items. This compares to our previous guidance of a mid-single-digit decline in EPS." Click here for the full release »
Revenue was at $5.77 billion, also beating estimates. Aluminum demand is sensitive to economic activity, so the company's earnings are widely considered as an economic bellwether. â€œOur performance this quarter shows our repositioning of the Company is on the right path,â€ said Klaus Kleinfeld, Alcoa Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in a press release. â€œWe continued to build our value-add businesses, capturing demand for innovative material solutions across multiple markets. Our commodity business delivered better performance in a tougher market environment, and we continued to reshape the portfolio to lower the cost base. Across the board, productivity was exceptional â€“ achieving our full year target in the first nine months.â€ Of course, it's hard to get too excited about Alcoa's results. As ZeroHedge noted last quarter, analyst expectations have been steadily revised downward for some time now.

REUTERS/China DailyPeople take pictures of a storm surge under the influence of Typhoon Fitow in Wenling, Zhejiang province, October 6, 2013.It's day eight of the government shutdown. First, the scoreboard: And now the top stories:
AP President Barack Obama seemed to open the door Tuesday to a short-term fix to the couple of budget battles running their way through Congress. During a press conference with reporters, Obama signaled that he would be open to a deal that would reopen the government and raise the debt ceiling while allowing for negotiations between the two parties. "If they want to do that, reopen the government, extend the debt ceiling," Obama said. "If they can't do it for a long time, do it for the period of time in which these negotiations are taking place.  "Why is it that we've got hundreds and thousands of people who aren't working right now in order for what you just described to occur? It doesn't make any sense." But while he said that he was prepared to sit down and negotiate with Republicans on anything — as long as they agree to reopen the government and lift the debt ceiling first, he insisted, "We can't make extortion routine as part of our democracy. "Democracy doesn't function this way. And this is not just for me; it's also for my successors in office. Whatever party they're from, they shouldn't have to pay a ransom either for Congress doing its basic job. We've got to put a stop to it." The federal government shutdown entered into its eighth full day on Tuesday, with no immediate end in sight. And Congress needs to raise the debt ceiling by Oct. 17 — nine days away — to avoid a potential default. Noon on Tuesday marked the halfway point — 8.5 days — between the start of the shutdown and the debt-ceiling deadline. His press conference came after he called House Speaker John Boehner on Tuesday morning, when he reiterated that he wouldn't negotiate with the threats of a shutdown and economic calamity hanging overhead.  House Republicans are preparing to pass two bills that they hope will force Democrats into negotiations over the two budget battles as part of a "working group" that's being compared to the 2011 "supercommittee" on deficit reduction.  Meanwhile, Senate Democrats on Tuesday are introducing their own bill to permit a "clean" debt-ceiling hike. Obama breathlessly tried to explain why there were no tricks, no workarounds, and no getting around Congress raising the debt ceiling. He said that there are no "silver bullets." There's no "magic wand." And options frequently discussed as alternatives — such as the 14th Amendment and minting a high-value platinum coin — also wouldn't work.  "I say, imagine, in your private life, if you decided that I'm not going to pay my mortgage for a month or two. First of all, you're not saving money by not paying your mortgage. You're just a deadbeat. And you can anticipate that will hurt your credit, which means that in addition to the debt collectors calling, you're going to have trouble borrowing in the future," Obama said. "And if you are able to borrow in the future, you're going to have to borrow at a higher rate. Well, what's true for individuals is also true for nations."
ScreenshotSTOCKHOLMÂ (Reuters) - With 100 million people logging on every day for a fix of its games likeÂ Candy CrushSaga, global game maker King is showing rivals not just how to hook players, but how to get them to pay. King is the latest among European tech firms likeÂ Rovio, creator of mega-hitÂ Angry Birds, and Mojang, behind Minecraft, to make it big on the global gaming scene. But its stunning profitability in an industry littered with firms who failed to make money from popular games has made it a totem for others seeking to emulate its success. King's focus on the multi-billion dollar mobile games market - creating short, addictive puzzles for the fastest-growing part of the gaming industry - has helped it reap profits rare in its field. Though the company does not publish numbers, industry experts have estimated its revenues at $1 million-$3 million a day. Media reports now talk about an IPO valuation of $5 billion after a source recently said the company had filed to go public in theUnited States. King was set up inÂ SwedenÂ a decade ago by friends working at the same tech startup and got 34 million euros funding fromÂ Apax PartnersÂ and Index Ventures in 2005. It has been profitable since, a fact that analysts put down to its ability to persuade players to pay several times over to continue the same game. Its "freemium model", in which games are free but players can pay for add-ons or extra lives, has been particularly effective because of the success ofÂ Candy Crush, described by some analysts as a global phenomenon. "Candy CrushÂ is one of the biggest mass market consumer games in years," saidÂ Adam KrejcikÂ at Eilers Research inÂ California. "They have been profitable for a while. This game has certainly brought them into a new category." The puzzle game, in which players line up gleaming 3-D sweets to knock out jelly, chocolate and liquorice, is available online, onÂ smartphoneÂ and Facebook. It has held the No. 1 spot for apps on Facebook for nine months and is Apple's top-grossing U.S. app, more popular than Spotify and TripAdvisor. King also says it is considering new platforms for the game such as smart TV. Globally, mobile game revenues generated through Apple iOS &amp; Google Playstore are expected to exceed $10 billion this year, according to Krejcik. Roughly half of those are revenues generated by seven publishers including King, DeNa, GungHo Online and Electronic Arts. BITE-SIZED According to King's Chief Creative OfficerÂ Sebastian Knutsson,Â Candy CrushÂ is addictive because it's equal parts pain and fun and fits consumers' short attention span. "We talk internally about.. bite-sized entertainment, and we think that fits the mobile generation of today... short game rounds as opposed to having a super deep, long game," he said. Knutsson, one of the five founders of King who between them hold 25 percent, is also part of the 10-strong Swedish team that came up withÂ Candy Crush. It combines elements of other popular games - the shiny graphics of Bejewelled, the candies ofÂ Candy LandÂ and the grid-like action of Tetris. "Candies felt like something that everybody would have a positive feeling about.. And I wanted something that could have shine and glossiness without being something unattainable," Knutsson told Reuters in aÂ StockholmÂ office where meeting rooms have names like Bubble Witch Lair, after the game. Players lured by the appealing graphics ofÂ Candy CrushÂ can pay for more lives, or must wait for 30 minutes before they may start again - though some cheat and move the clocks on theirÂ smartphonesÂ ahead so they can continue. The game's appeal was broadened by its social aspect: Players can share their progress on Facebook, swapping lives as well as tips on how to crack the various levels. Others share their pain: "DieÂ Candy Crush. Die." writes one player, stuck at level 60, on King's Facebook page. King says its decision last year to shift its focus to its mobile platform was pivotal because that market was booming and the game suited it well. The candies worked well on mobile screens, Knutsson said. Analysts note the game is easy to hop in and out of, making it a good time killer for mobile players, yet offers new challenges to give players a new twist when they play again. "We knew it would be big on Facebook but I think the mobile success is what really took us by surprise," Knutsson said. The game's success led CEO of arch-rivalÂ Zynga, former Microsoft Corp Xbox boss Don Mattrick to admit: "I'll fess up, I'm aÂ candy crushÂ player and I've enjoyed it." California-basedÂ Zynga's trajectory demonstrates the fate of many others in the industry. In 2009 it developed social game FarmVille - a huge hit in which players harvested crops and raised livestock - but is now struggling to make money from it because it is still based on Facebook as players migrate in droves to mobile.Â Zynga's stock price has slumped 65 percent since a high-profile $1 billion IPO two years ago and it is now slashing staff numbers while closing offices. NEXT LEVEL Market researcherÂ NewzooÂ estimates global game revenues across all platforms to reach $86.1 billion by 2016 as the number of gamers reaches 1.55 billion. It expects the fastest growth to come from mobile gaming, which will make up almost 30 percent of the total, up from about 17 percent this year. Accordingly King - currently offering 150 games and boasting more than a billion gameplays each day - is lining up its next mobile games, readying alternatives for when its immense audience is no longer as mesmerized by its cascading candies. Analysts expect the company to launch a mobile version of Farm Heroes Saga, a game in which players must match 3 items, which is already Facebook's second-most popular app. King is already starting to roll out a mobile version of Papa Pear Saga, currently available on the web and on Facebook, in which players bounce and dive into barrels. In the meantime, it plans to build on growth inÂ Asia, the latest market to succumb toÂ Candy Crush, which is gaining popularity there along with Supercell's Clash of Clans. "These are really the first western productions to break into the top 10 or the top 20 in the app store inÂ Japan," said David Gibson, a senior analyst at Macquarie inÂ Tokyo.

Economist Stephanie Pomboy, founder of MacroMavens, does public appearances sparingly. She jokes that it's because no one wants to hang out with perma bears like her. Today, though, she's giving a rare talk at  The Big Picture Conference, a meeting of investors and finance folk in NYC. The talk is called 'You Can't Handle The Taper', and Pomboy's thesis is this: The U.S. economy and the consumers in it are in no way ready for the end of QE.  "The idea that the economy can withstand the taper seems unrealistic since we're as levered as we've ever been," she said. Sure, we feel richer thanks to the Federal Reserve's bond buying program, and the U.S. consumer is delveraging nicely, but that same consumer is indirectly benefiting from the leverage in other sectors of the economy. Here's some of how Pomboy broke it down (though she could keep going). On the top of the economic pile, higher income consumers are rolling in "shareholder goodies funded in capital markets by corporations," said Pomboy.  On the corporate side, reduced interest expense has seriously juiced  profits while corporations have cheap access to capital as well. Despite the cash, though, corporations aren't investing in the economy because they're simply not strong enough. If they were, they would. It gets worse. Homeowners, says Pomboy, have benefitted enormously from the buying of distressed properties by institutional investors and private equity funds.  QE also lured individuals into the market and allowed them to refinance. Meanwhile, she argues, we've already started seeing the PE firms heading for the exits of the real estate market. "[QE] has succeeded in lifting asset prices but the feedback loop to the real economy" isn't creating jobs yet. The wealth effect isn't lowering unemployment. And that's what Pomboy really thinks we need — income growth. "Like a roadrunner off a cliff, this consumer will drop," she said. Adding, "I'd love to make some money but at this point I think the challenge is just to preserve capital." So what's holding us back? Over and over again Pomboy said that fiscal policy was acting against the Fed, which is doing everything it can and in its power to keep things going. Go figure.
Google ImagesSherlock Holmes in "The-Seven-Percent Solution"The Wall Street Journal's Jon Hilsenrath has a fascinating, lengthy breakdown todayÂ of how the Fed decided not to touch its bond buying program at its September meeting, and the apparent missteps along the way. Among other things, it confirms the Fed wasn't exactly blown away by the incoming economic data, which ultimately forced them to delay the tapering of their stimulative large-scale asset purchase program. As the June FOMC meeting approached, some members suggested tying the next tweak to monetary policy to the unemployment rate. But it was the way they referred to it that was interesting: "In a flurry of emails and phone calls before the gathering and at a dinner during the event, several officials zeroed in on an idea some people called "The Seven-Per-Cent Solution," a reference to a 1976 Sherlock Holmes film in which the fictional detective becomes addicted to cocaine. Several officials argued at the meeting that the Fed should signal bond buying would end when the jobless rate fell to near 7%, according to people familiar with the talks." Hilsenrath goes on to describe how this idea ultimately surfaced in a Ben Bernanke news conference.Â  "When asset purchases ultimately come to an end, the unemployment rate would likely be in the vicinity of 7%, with solid economic growth supporting further job gains," Bernanke said.

REUTERS/Jonathan ErnstU.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew.UBS interest rate strategists Mike Schumacher and Boris Rjavinski say issuance of "super premium Treasuries" is "the most attractive stopgap solution to the debt ceiling crisis" in Washington, D.C. that is roiling markets. "Better than a trillion dollar coin," even. In a nutshell, the idea is that the Treasury would issue 10-year or 30-year notes that yield higher rates than those in the market. Investors would have to pay up for the ability to hold these premium securities. Schumacher and Rjavinski say they discovered the idea in a Time Magazine piece by Christopher Matthews, who in turn cites Bloomberg View columnist Matt Levine. Levine provides a simple, clear explanation of how super-premium Treasury issuance could help the Treasury Department to get around the debt ceiling: Note: The revenue and spending numbers used in the above example are from the month between February 15 and March 15, 2013, and are not representative of the rest of the year due to seasonal factors. However, the point of the demonstration still stands. "The overwhelming positive is that Treasury could issue bonds through somewhat normal channels, although with decidedly abnormal coupons and prices," say Schumacher and Rjavinski. "Another plus is that default would be off the table." But how does this allow the Treasury to get around the debt ceiling? "The debt ceiling applies to the face amount of bonds, not the amount raised, so selling a $100 bond for $275 only counts $100 against the debt ceiling and gets you $175 in debt-ceiling-free money," says Levine. "There are rules against issuing premium Treasury bonds, but the rules are just Treasury rules and they can be changed unilaterally by Treasury with no notice and no Congressional approval." The UBS strategists run through a hypothetical scenario: Treasury could announce a series of special auctions. It would maximize relief room under the debt ceiling by focusing on 30-year bonds, but might want to issue some 10s to minimize yield curve distortions and reduce costs. In our view, these bonds would appeal almost solely to total return buyers. We are not accounting experts by any stretch of the imagination. Still, we think it is reasonable to say that investors such as banks and insurers who operate with accounting constraints would pass on bonds trading at vast premia. The viability of the auctions would be a function of how cheaply the bonds are priced versus on-the-runs. It is impossible to say whether 20 [basis points] would be a large enough concession. Investors might gain a nice fillip in addition to picking up a liquidity premium. Treasury could decide to buy back these bonds in a few months, when the politicians presumably have raised the ceiling. Naturally, Treasury could not guarantee a buyback on auction day. Still, imagine for a moment that the buyback did happen, at say +5 [basis points] to on-the-runs. The investor would stand to gain 15 [basis points] of spread tightening. The 20% 30-year bond has a duration near 14 years, so 15 [basis points] equates to a bit more than 200 [basis points] of incremental total return. Not bad. Some observers have suggested that Treasury simply reopen a bond, rather than create a new issue with an extremely high coupon. Treasury issues normally can be reopened for up to one year, subject to restrictions on original issue discount. One more reminder – we are not accounting experts. The highest-priced Treasury security that was issued within the last year trades a bit below 101, so that does not help. If Treasury figured out a way to reopen an old issue, it could choose among a dozen issues that trade in the 140s. These bonds’ coupons range from 6.75% to 8.75%, and they mature between 2020 and 2026. How much would issuing super premium Treasuries cost? "For the 30-year bond, the 20 [basis point] premium combined with a duration around 13.5 years equates to cost of 2.7% of proceeds," say Schumacher and Rjavinski. "The average monthly budget deficit for fiscal 2014 appears to be around $60 billion. If Treasury decided to fund it entirely with super premium 30-year bonds, the monthly cost would be about $1.6 billion. Using 10-years instead of 30-years would reduce the cost to roughly $0.8 billion." "The program would not be free, but a price of $1-1.5 billion per month seems like a compelling bargain compared to a U.S. default."

APRep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.)Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) has been a loud voice within the House Republican caucus against the strategy of shutting down the government to demand changes to Obamacare. In an interview with National Review's Robert Costa, he called Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and his allies in the House the "lemming caucus," because they're willing to lead the party off a cliff in pursuit of impossible policy goals. And Nunes has a bold strategy to address the lemmings' negative influence on his party: Wait around for them to come to their senses. No really, that's what he told NR. Emphasis added: NR: Â As this shutdown continues, whatâ€™s your message to the leadership? Can they ignore the lemmings or not? NUNES: Uh, no. I think we have to continue; I think until these guys that put this strategy into effect see it play out, we wonâ€™t learn our lesson. We have to let it all play out until they decide that they want to be part of a functioning majority that gives us the most leverage that we can get to fight for less government and to fix or change Obamacare, get rid of it. But you canâ€™t do any of it with the way weâ€™re doing it now. If Republicans like Nunes didn't want to follow the lemmings' shutdown strategy, they had ways to stop it. They could vote for Democratic motions to bring a clean funding bill to the floor. They could sign a discharge petition to bring a vote on a bill to reopen the government at current funding levels. Or even more simply, they could have applied the same pressure on leadership that the lemmings do: Refusing to provide votes for strategies they oppose. If Nunes and his allies had told Speaker John Boehner they wouldn't vote for defund-Obamacare bills, Boehner would have had to go back to the archconservatives and tell them their preferred strategy wasn't possible due to resistance elsewhere in his caucus, just as Boehner does all the time to the moderates. But instead, Nunes' "strategy" is to wait around for people like Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.), who thinks we are living in end times, to figure out that their legislative strategy is suboptimal. Which makes him arguably crazier than Bachmann.
APSen. Tom Coburn"I would dispel the rumor that is going around that you hear on every newscast, that if we donâ€™t raise the debt ceiling, we will default on our debt,"Â saysÂ Sen.Tom Coburn, R-Okla. â€œWe wonâ€™t. Weâ€™ll continue to pay our interest.â€This is crazy talk. While the Treasury Department could prioritize interest payments after October 17 â€“ the day the Treasury Department says it no longer has legal authority to pay the nationâ€™s debts â€“ and not pay Social Security and Medicare, this would buy a few days at most. Meanwhile, interest rates will soar, stock prices will plummet, the global economy will begin spiraling downward, and millions of Americans wouldnâ€™t receive their Social Security and Medicare. So why are Republicans talking like this? Because they want to sound as if theyâ€™re willing to blow up the economy if they donâ€™t get their way. A crazy person with a bomb is much scarier than someone holding a bomb who looks and acts reasonable. Sounding crazy is part of the Republican bargaining strategy.Â But the President and the Democrats must not give in. If we get to October 17th and the Republicans are still holding the nation hostage, the President has only one option: He must ignore the debt ceiling and order the Treasury to continue to pay all the nationâ€™s bills. He should rely on Section 4 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which says the â€œvalidity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law â€¦ shall not be questioned.â€ The debt itself is clearly â€œauthorized by lawâ€ because itâ€™s the direct result of laws authorizing the U.S. to spend and to tax. The showdown over the debt ceiling is over payment of the debt, not the legality of the debt itself. Arguably, what the Constitution requires trumps any law governing the debt-ceiling.Â  If Republicans disagree, let them try to impeach the President. Their polls are already dropping. The latest Washington Post-ABCÂ pollÂ shows 70 percent of the public disapproving of their tactics (65 percent disapproved before the shutdown), while the Presidentâ€™s disapproval remains at 51 percent. An attempted impeachment would reveal to the public just how crazy Republicans have become.
Mohamed Nureldin Abdallah / REUTERSGold mine workers walk to their shelter during a sandstorm in Al-Ibedia locality at River Nile State. KHARTOUM (Reuters) - With its scrubland, unpaved roads and mud brick huts, the Jebel Amer area in Darfur, western Sudan, can look like a poor and desolate place. Under the ground, though, lies something sought by people everywhere: gold. In the past year or so the precious metal has begun to alter the nature of the decade-old conflict in Darfur, transforming it from an ethnic and political fight to one that, at least in part, is over precious metal. Fighting between rival tribes over the Jebel Amer gold mine that stretches for some 10 km (six miles) beneath the sandy hills of North Darfur has killed more than 800 people and displaced some 150,000 others since January. Arab tribes, once heavily armed by the government to suppress insurgents, have turned their guns on each other to get their hands on the mines. Rebel groups that oppose the government also want the metal. The gold mine death toll is more than double the number of all people killed by fighting between the army, rebels and rival tribes in Darfur in 2012, according to U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon's quarterly reports to the Security Council. U.N. officials and diplomats told Reuters the government has been complicit in the violence by encouraging at least one militia group to seize control of mines, a charge the government denies. Until last year the Darfur conflict pitted the government and its Arab militias against three large rebel groups. The Jebel Amer attack changed that, dividing Arab tribes against each other. But international peace efforts are still focused on bringing the main rebel groups into a Qatar-sponsored deal Khartoum signed with two splinter groups in 2011. At the last meeting to discuss the Qatar deal in September, Qatar's deputy prime minister, Ahmed bin Abdullah al-Mahmoud, expressed concern about the recent tribal violence, but stressed a key factor in bringing peace to Darfur would be to get the rebels to the negotiating table, according to Qatari state media. LOST OIL The conflict in Darfur began as a struggle between African pastoralists and Arab cattle-owning nomads over access to land. It grew into what the U.S. State Department described as genocide after the government began sponsoring militias to put down a rebel insurgency. In all, fighting in Darfur since 2003 has killed more than 200,000 people and forced some 2 million from their homes according to human rights groups and the United Nations. In 2009, the International Criminal Court charged Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir with war crimes for his role in the Darfur violence, charges he rejects. The recent resurgence in violence is rooted in Sudan's loss of a huge chunk of its territory in the south two years ago. When South Sudan seceded in 2011, the rump state of Sudan lost most of its oil production - worth some $7 billion in 2010 - sending the economy into a spin. Sudan's GDP contracted by 10 percent last year, according to the World Bank. To replace the oil the government in Khartoum has encouraged people to dig for gold. Now half a million diggers roam Darfur and the north of the country with mine detectors and sledgehammers, according to the mining ministry. The gold rush helped boost output by 50 percent last year to around 50 tons, making Sudan Africa's third-largest producer, equal with Mali after South Africa and Ghana, according to official data and expert estimates. Gold exports have become Sudan's lifeline, providing the government with $2.2 billion (net) last year and making up more than 60 percent of all exports. Sudan's central bank, desperate for anything to secure foreign currency, pays artisanal miners up to 20 percent more than the global market price, several gold trading sources told Reuters. The central bank denies this. At the same time, around a quarter of Sudan's annual gold output is smuggled abroad, industry sources inside and outside Sudan said. If that figure is right, the government lost up to $700 million last year - money it badly needs. "The government is so desperate for the gold that they are willing to stoke conflict to get artisanal mines under its control," said Magdi El Gizouli, a fellow at the Rift Valley Institute, a think tank based in London and Nairobi. He said the mining ministry had handed out hundreds of exploration licenses to firms but only 20 were actually producing gold. "So they need to control mines which produce like Jebel Amer." The mining ministry said it wants to improve the performance of license holders, many of which do not yet produce. QUEST FOR GOLD On a sunny morning in early January, dozens of Land Cruisers surrounded the town of El Sireaf near the Jebel Amer gold mine. Men readied themselves behind mounted machine guns and mortars and started firing. "I saw 30 cars. They came from all sides and fired randomly into houses," said Fateh, a worker who hid in his house as the attack began. "They shot women, children, even cattle, anything they spotted," he said, asking for his full name to be withheld as he fears the gunmen might come back. The attackers, members of the Arab Rizeigat tribe appeared to locals to have one goal: to seize control of the mines from the Bani Hussein, a rival Arab tribe. "They wanted the gold," said al-Tijani Hamid, a Bani Hussein tribesman who lives in Britain but was visiting El Sireaf during the January attacks. "There were ... corpses in the streets everywhere. It was terrible," said Hamid, who has now given up his UK teaching job at an agricultural college in Reading to help organise aid. A truce was reached in late January, but the two tribes fought again in February and in June. The Rizeigat have sent hundreds of fighters to consolidate control of the mine and to avenge cattle rustling by the Bani Hussein, residents said. Until the fighting began, the area was dominated by small artisanal miners. Over the past couple of years, gold diggers arrived from neighboring Chad, the Central African Republic and even far-flung West African countries such as Nigeria and Niger, Darfur residents said. "There were even some Libyans, Syrians and Jordanians," said Suleiman Dubaid, a Bani Hussein leader who said seven members of his family were killed during the fighting. "Some people made 6,000 (Sudanese) pounds ($800) a day." The gold is smuggled out in bags or underwear, to middlemen on the other side of the Chad border. From there it goes to the capital N'Djamena where it is loaded onto commercial flights or stashed in the baggage of courier firms, Sudanese gold sources and Darfur residents say. The final destination is often Dubai, the Middle East's main gold market. Some gold is also smuggled to Cameroon, where it is exported and shipped to gold markets in India and China, a Sudanese gold source said. In 2011, after the state lost access to oil, the Sudanese government clamped down on the smugglers. Nonetheless, gold revenues are expected to fall as low as $1.5 billion this year due to declining global prices. The weak market comes as output at Sudan's biggest industrial mine, Ariab, in the Nubian desert, has fallen: to around 2 tons in 2011, the last reported figure. That may be one reason, say Western diplomats, tribal leaders and international peacekeepers working in Darfur, why government officials encouraged the Rizeigat tribe to break the Bani Hussein's control of the Jebel Amer mine. "They wanted the Rizeigat to shake up things a bit so that at least some of the gold goes to the central bank," said a Western diplomat. Khartoum has used the Rizeigat before: The tribe provided the core of the feared "Janjaweed" militias, armed and unleashed by the government in 2003 to put down the rebel insurgency, according to rights groups such as Human Rights Watch. The Rizeigat were also Khartoum's allies during the 1983-2005 civil war with the south, sending fighters armed by the government. Mining minister Kamal Abdel-Latif visited the Jebel Amer mine late in December, a trip covered by state media. There he told the Bani Hussein that only 5 of the 15 tons the mine produced annually was going to the central bank, said Tijani, who was present at the meeting. Abdel-Latif is close to Khartoum's security establishment. His appointment in 2011 was widely seen by Western diplomats and local analysts as an attempt by Khartoum to get a better grip on the sprawling amateur mines. At the same time, the state-linked Sudanese Media Centre reported that the North Darfur government and top security command had met "to devise a meticulous plan to guarantee that all the gold produced (in Jebel Amer) will be directed to the Central Bank of Sudan." A top Rizeigat tribal official with close government ties said officials had asked Rizeigat paramilitary forces to break up the hold of the Bani Hussein over the mine. "They encouraged some of our tribesmen serving in paramilitary forces to seize the mine." Adam Sheikha, a Bani Hussein tribal leader and lawmaker for Bashir's National Congress Party said during the January attack, many Rizeigat wore the uniform of Sudan's border guards, a paramilitary force formed when Khartoum armed militias in the early stages of the conflict. "The weapons they used were issued by the army," he said. Several witnesses confirmed they had seen attackers wearing border guard uniforms. Sudan's mining ministry said it had nothing to do with the Jebel Amer clashes. Authorities also denied reporters access to the mine. "The ministry has nothing to do with the tribal violence," a senior official read out to a reporter visiting the ministry on Khartoum's Nile banks. He declined further comment. The Rizeigat had their own reasons to seize the mine, according to Western diplomats and tribal leaders. Many of them had been integrated into state forces such as the border guards or central reserve police, but Khartoum has slashed funding to those forces. Since the January attack, Rizeigat tribesmen have mined Jebel Amer on their own, residents said. Guards have sealed off roads and banned anyone from the Bani Hussein or even some government forces from approaching the site. They attacked a nearby army base in June, according to an internal report from the UNAMID peacekeepers seen by Reuters. REBELS Darfuri rebels want gold, too. Tribesmen from the Zaghawa, the backbone of the rebel Sudan Liberation army (SLA), until recently operated its own mine in Hashaba to the east of Jebel Amer. There is no data on how much rebels make from gold sales but locals and UNAMID staff say Hashaba's output was much smaller than Jebel Amer. The potential spoils are huge. To the south of Jebel Amer, for instance, there is an area called "Shangil Tobaya", which is Sudanese Arabic for "turn a brick and you find gold." Rebels and Arab militias are vying for control for a strip of low-rise mountains. "People say there is gold up there but we cannot check it because the armed militias are there," said Adam Saleh, a local farmer. Khartoum downplays the tribal violence and the changing nature of the conflict. "The security situation improves from day to day," said Osman Kibr, governor of North Darfur. "We had some issues but we've fixed them," he told diplomats who had come to El Fasher in June to discuss the recent surge in tribal violence. But security in Darfur has deteriorated. Aid groups report a sharp rise in hijackings and robberies by Arab militias since mid-2012. This has stopped the U.N. World Food Programme delivering food to several areas, and delayed development projects backed by a Qatar-sponsored donor conference in April where pledges of $1 billion were made. Even some government officials now wonder if the Rizeigat are out of control. In the past, tribal leaders would call a meeting and try to end bloodshed by offering compensation for families of victims and pressing local leaders into making peace. Now "the traditional tribal reconciliation mechanism doesn't work anymore," said Tijani Seissi, head of the regional Darfur authority and a former rebel who made peace with Sudan under the Qatar deal. "We need to fight them." (Laessing reported in both Khartoum and Darfur; Edited by Simon Robinson, Richard Woods)
Earlier, we highlighted a note from Miller Tabak chief technical market analyst Jonathan Krinsky, who said the S&amp;P 500 was at a "critical juncture." The index was at risk of breaking below a long-term trend line. With today's declines, it has now fallen below that line. ED&amp;F Man Capital managing director Tom di Galoma alerted us to this in an email. Check out the chart below. Business Insider/Matthew Boesler, data from Bloomberg In the absence of any economic data releases today, the big story continues to be the fiscal crisis in Washington, D.C. and the effect it is having on markets. In particular, the Treasury bill market is going wild. Short-term interest rates are blowing out as traders continue to price in increased chances that the government fails to raise the debt ceiling in a timely manner, and the Treasury is forced to default on a coupon payment.
APHouse Republican leadership has hatched a new plan on Washington's fiscal impasse that it hopes will lure Democrats into a negotiation.Â  According to a House leadership aide, Republicans plan to consider two bills soon. The first would require paychecks for essential government employees to be paid on time. The next pay period for many of these employees comes between Friday and next Tuesday.Â  "This would alleviate stress," the House aide said. The second step would be to pass a bill that would establish a "negotiating team" among House and Senate Republicans and Democrats on the upcoming need to raise the debt ceiling, as well as other fiscal issues.Â  This proposal has been described as the return of the "Supercommittee," theÂ 2011 Joint Committee on Deficit Reduction that was established in the Budget Control Act. But unlike the Supercommittee, the "negotiating team" wouldn't have legal authority, the GOP aide said.Â  The two bills would then be merged and sent to the Senate.Â  Essentially, what House Republicans are trying to doÂ is put Senate Democrats in a corner. If they don't budge, Republicans can accuse Democrats of withholding paychecks for essential employees that have been working throughout the eight-day shutdown â€” including the Capitol Police. If Democrats do blink, Republicans get the negotiations that they want â€” though it's still not clear what they will demand. Up until now, Senate Democrats have resisted the House GOP's "piecemeal" approach to fund and reopen certain, popular parts of the government. In this proposal, Republicans think that keeping essential workers paid will force Democrats to the table. But Democrats have already resisted GOP-passed "rifle-shot" bills to reopen the National Institutes of Health and the Womens, Infants, and Children program, among others. "One area where Democrats have been willing to work with Republicans to ease the pain of the shutdown to date is with government employees," another House GOP leadership aide said.  "With paychecks set to be delayed, there will be tremendous pressure to fix that. Â The only thing standing in the way is Democrats' willingness to negotiate with Republicans. In divided government, neither party can refuse to negotiate. Will Senator Reid really deny workers a paycheck in order to avoid sitting down at a table with Republicans and simply talking? President Barack Obama called House Speaker John Boehner Tuesday morning and emphasized that Boehner should allow for a vote on the Senate-passed "clean" continuing resolution to end the government shutdown. He said that he wouldn't negotiate on fiscal issues with the threats of a shutdown and potential default hanging overhead. "The President also repeated his willingness to negotiate on priorities that he has identified including policies that expand economic opportunity, support private sector job creation, enhance the competitiveness of American businesses, strengthen the Affordable Care Act and continue to reduce the nationâ€™s deficit," the White House said.
Google Images Today, the Federal Reserve released new $100 notes. They have a bunch of new security features, but they will remain "Benjamins," as Founding Father Franklin will remain on the front, as he has been for 99 years. But before 1914, $100 bills featured several different portraits, including 6th President James Monroe and Union Admiral David Farragut. One Franklin predecessor stands out from the rest.Â  His name was Thomas Hart Benton. And he went by the name "Old Bullion."Â  Benton was a five-term senator from Missouri who'd served as anÂ aide-de-camp to General Andrew Jackson. His loyalty to Jackson put him squarely in Old Hickory's camp when Jackson declared war on the Second Bank of the United States. According to a Benton biography by Teddy Roosevelt â€” himself a hard money enthusiast who admired the senator â€”Â Benton was the most well-known gold bug in the country, "zealously" in favor of an independent treasury and hard-money payments. "The government was to receive nothing but gold and silver for its revenues, and it should be kept by its own officers in real, not constructive, treasuries â€”Â strong buildings, with special officers to hold the keys." Jackson and Benton, largely representing rural interests, argued the Second Bank had gained too much power and was subverting states' rights. Farmers moving out west had little use for the credit the bank subsisted on, they said.Â  Roosevelt quotes Benton thusly: "I am willing to see the charter expire, without providing any substitute for the present Bank. I am willing to see the currency of the federal government left to the hard money mentioned and intended in the Constitution;â€¦ every species of paper might be left to the state authorities, unrecognized by the federal government!" Of course Jackson and Benton ended up succeeding, and the country proceeded to enter its chaotic Free Bank Era, where local banks sprung up across the country issuing currency that often proved practically worthless. Benton would claim he never intended such an outcome â€”Â "I did not join in putting down the Bank of the United States to put up a wilderness of local banksâ€¦I did not strike Caesar to make Antony master of Rome." But Roosevelt admits Benton's "mental vision was singularly warped in regard to some subjects,"Â and the SenatorÂ appears to have numbered among those who blamed the rich for having purposefully sparked the panic of 1837. He was not so bent, however, as to not recognize when crises required unpleasant but necessary measures, and he ended up supporting a one-time issue of redeemable Treasury notes. Still, he never recanted his views on currency, and he went on influence William Jennings Bryan, probably the most famous hard money proponent in American history (though by then gold had taken on a different role entirely, and Jennings Bryan only argued against gold in favor of silver). He cited Benton by name in his "Cross of Gold" speech. It's probably best to remember Benton for his opposition to slavery and secession; both views ended up costing him elected office. This is what most interested Roosevelt, and John F. Kennedy included Benton among his "Profiles In Courage." "No man gave more than Senator Benton for the preservation of the Union," Kennedy wrote. Thus, when national greenbacks were reestablished in 1863, Benton, who died in 1858, landed on the $100.
REUTERS/Jason LeeWang Jing, a Chinese telecommunications billionaire, has the rights to build a canal through Nicaragua.NOT since the civil war of the 1980s have so many helicopters been clattering over remote parts of Nicaragua. But now the guys squinting down through the tree canopy are in suits: lawyers and business consultants from the United States, Australian engineers, British environmental auditors, even Chinese executives. Their per diems are being paid by Wang Jing, a Chinese businessman whose $40 billion quest is to build a canal from Nicaragua’s Atlantic coast to its Pacific one. The dream of such a canal, three times as long as the one that cuts through Panama, is centuries old, and has made fools of all who ever believed in it. But Mr Wang has already pulled off one remarkable feat: he has persuaded the former revolutionaries in the Sandinista government to put Nicaragua’s sovereignty in hock to make the dream come true. To do so, he has deployed little more than his personal chequebook and a bit of old-fashioned swagger in the style of Cornelius Vanderbilt, the tycoon who blazed a trail by shipping migrants from the eastern United States to its west coast via Nicaragua during the Gold Rush years of the 1840s and 1850s. "He’s a person who radiates confidence," says Manuel Coronel Kautz, president of Nicaragua’s canal authority. "His company headquarters alone would cover half of Managua." The chutzpah has played well with a government eager for someone new to believe in now that its former benefactor, Venezuela’s Hugo Chávez, has died. "This lad is a revolutionary," Mr Coronel purrs. Since June, when the Sandinista-stuffed National Assembly rubber-stamped a law granting a 50-year concession, renewable up to 100 years, to Mr Wang’s HKND Group, many have wondered whether the 40-year-old telecoms boss is a crank. In August the Associated Press reported that in many countries, including Nicaragua, where he has claimed to be doing business, his companies are barely noticeable. Although both Mr Wang and President Daniel Ortega insist that the project will go ahead, people who have worked with HKND say it has more of an option to build than an obligation. In effect, the cost of the option is the tens of millions of dollars that Mr Wang is expected to pay from his own pocket to find out which route is most physically and financially feasible. Hence ERM, a British consultancy, is looking at the environmental and social impact of digging a deep channel through Lake Nicaragua, one of the largest in Latin America, and carving through ancestral indigenous lands. Australian engineers are pondering how to remove millions of truckloads of dirt in a country with no large excavators, let alone nearby roads or railways. McKinsey, a business consultancy, is said to be working out how the project could make enough money to entice sovereign-wealth funds to bankroll it. The economic case is not easy to make. And if the engineering challenges are too severe, even some supporters of the project say it may be impossible to raise the billions of dollars necessary to go any further. HKND argues that large volumes of globally traded goods are being carried on ships already too big for the Panama Canal, even after its current expansion. Nicaragua’s canal, with twice the draught of Panama’s, would aim to accommodate such giants. But world trade is sluggish; and meanwhile, new routes may develop through the Arctic. The project may also rest on shaky legal ground. Gabriel Álvarez, a law professor at Nicaragua’s National Autonomous University, says there have been 32 charges of unconstitutionality--a number he reckons unprecedented in Nicaragua. He points out that the law gives the company unfettered and tax-free rights over vast tracts of land, which would violate the country’s sovereignty. It also requires the supposedly autonomous Central Bank to waive its right to sovereign immunity, which has alarmed economists. At the same time, the government pledges to expropriate all land along the chosen route at potentially below-market rates, which has outraged indigenous groups and businessmen. In return, the Nicaraguan state gets no more than $10m a year, plus a stake in the company that rises about ten percentage points every ten years. "It’s like there’s an unwritten slogan: 'The canal at any cost’," says Manuel Ortega Hegg, vice-president of Nicaragua’s Academy of Science. Mr Coronel rejects such arguments. He believes that the company will work in the interests of Nicaragua, overseen by a canal commission that will safeguard sovereignty. He says the economic benefits of investment and jobs will easily outweigh the costs (though he acknowledges that much of the construction may be carried out by Chinese technicians). Mr Wang, he adds, was given the concession because HKND was prepared to raise the money itself. Mr Coronel is coy about where the cash would come from, but hints that he hopes for official Chinese investment. "No American company would do this if their government wasn’t supportive," he says. "It must be the same with the Chinese." Among those who oppose the concession are many who, under different circumstances, would see it as a lifesaver for impoverished Nicaragua. Like many in Central America, they believe the first country to find a new way across the isthmus would reap enormous gains. The trouble, they say, is that Mr Ortega’s Sandinistas control all organs of government, including the Supreme Court, which means that legal and environmental challenges are unlikely to get a fair hearing. There was almost no public debate before the law was approved. As a result, Mr Wang’s contract may not be safe if the government changes. That does not worry Mr Coronel. The white-haired son of one of Nicaragua’s most famous poets, he has long dreamed of the canal as a way of raising Nicaraguan living standards--an unfulfilled pledge of the Sandinista revolution. His only concern, he says, is that, at 80, he may not live long enough to see the dream fulfilled. But by then, in Mr Ortega’s words, Nicaragua will have reached the "promised land".

Today we're at the Big Picture Conference, a day-long event put on by Ritholtz Wealth Management. Ritholtz's Josh Brown just closed up a group of panelists (all Chief Strategists at their respective firms)Â with this question â€” what are investors missing from the big market narrative right now? According to Brown, here's what we think we know:Â Investors look around and see that Japan is quiet, the Fed race is still undecided but policy is unlikely to change, Europe seems out of the worst, the United States is crawling along.  That's the picture, he said, but again, "what are we missing?" On deck to answer the question were Art Hogan,Â Chief Strategist at Lazard Capital, Dan Greenhaus, Chief Strategist at BTIG, and Jeffrey Kleintop Chief Strategist at LPL Financial. Hogan went first, and said simply that the American investor is missing what's going on outside the U.S. This is, in part, because there's so much noise. Throughout this discussion, all these strategists, especially Greenhaus, talked about the news as mere noise for money managers. This ties into Hogan's point. Americans, being so wrapped up in headlines about the Fed and our own government's issues at home, have forgotten about what opportunities are out there.  Or even worse, when investors see headlines talking doom in Europe and Japan, they're scared of what's out there. Â  All three strategists agreed that getting away from the noise can require some effort. That's where Jeff Kleintop of LPL Financial jumped in â€” the biggest thing we're missing, he said, is active management. In this Big Pitcure crowd, those are fighting words. The debate between active and passive management has been raging between money managers since the financial crisis and the subsequent, steady rise of the stock market made fools of almost every investor. "So many people have gone the passive route," said Kleintop, "but there are so many opportunities outside the United States," and they're hard to get to without an active money manager.Â  "I get that active management hasn't worked in a while," he continued, "but I think so many investors are going to be behind the curve on this... in bonds and equities." Last up was BTIG's Dan Greenhaus. His point was about the Federal Reserve â€” and Central Banks around the world â€” unwinding QE.Â  "People at the Fed and other central banks will say that 'we got this unwinding', Greenhaus said. But it may not be as simple as we think. No matter who the Fed Chairman is (and Greenhaus doesn't think it matters) we are in an unprecedented situation here. "It's easy to lose site of the fact that you're going to have to reverse... you're going to have to do some of this somehow... and I don't know how." No one does. And since no one knows, it's definitely missing.
The "Great Rotation" is the market theory that states investors are pulling money out of bonds and reallocating into stocks as the 30-year bond bull market runs out of gas and the Federal Reserve scales back its easy monetary policy. This thesis has been pushed aggressively by Bank of America Merrill Lynch's chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett. However, the strategists at Morgan Stanley have long been taking the opposite side of the argument. Today, Morgan Stanley's top strategist are out with a massive 72-page paper titled: "Great Rotation? Probably Not." "We think the concept of a ‘Great Rotation’ hugely simplifies the nuanced demand dynamics," wrote the analysts. "Based on our bottom-up assessment of investor segments, covering ~$89trn of assets, and the differing regulatory and demographic pressures on investor decision making, we conclude there are significant, and possibly underestimated, structural challenges to a rotation into equities." They identify a couple of big forces we should consider: We think two opposing rotations may be playing out simultaneously. Since January this year Retail and high net worth (HNW) investors have modestly reduced cash/near cash and increased risk assets. Global (equity and fixed income), income, and multi-asset products have been in particular demand. More recently, mutual fund flow data suggest a modest rotation out of fixed income and into equities, as confidence in economic growth has risen. (This trend was even stronger for money market funds in mid-2013, suggesting shifts more readily here than into equities). Against this, we see Institutional investors (Insurance and Pension schemes) doing almost the opposite – despite the risks to fixed income portfolio values from a rising rate cycle. Insurers facing Solvency II regulations and Defined Benefit Pension schemes needing to immunize risks are still reducing their equity weightings. Institutional de-risking could outweigh much, if not all, of any increased equity appetite in Retail. Defined Benefit (DB) and Defined Contribution (DC) Pension schemes represent ~45% of global equity investment, we estimate. Our analysis suggests this group will be a powerful headwind to any longer-term rotation back into equities, offsetting any cyclical re-risking from Retail and HNW investors. In other words, mom and pop are buying stocks, and pensions and insurance companies are selling. And the latter may be a bigger force than the former. However, Morgan Stanley adds that the ageing of mom and pop is preventing them from investing too aggressively. "[W]e think ageing demographics and lower risk appetite will focus investor demand on regular income, capital preservation and lower volatility of returns, limiting the strength of any rotation into core equities," they write. But they also point to the cash on the sidelines as a potential source of equity inflows. "But if risk appetite picks up, it could translate into re-allocation from cash into risk assets," they say. "We think Retail and HNW investors are more likely to chase market performance. Cash balances for private banking clients are still above longer-term averages."
Treasury bills are getting hit hard today as the debt ceiling deadline approaches with little signs of an agreement in Congress to raise it. The chart below shows how the yield on the 1-month T-bill maturing October 31 — which traders are referring to as "Halloween bills" — is blowing out. In the event that Congress doesn't come to an agreement on raising the debt ceiling by then, October 31 is the day the Treasury is projected to run out of cash, which means holders of those bills wouldn't receive interest payments. A $30 billion auction of four-week bills that just priced a few minutes ago was pretty ugly. The high yield at the auction was 0.35% — a 2.5 basis point tail — the highest since October 2008.

AP PhotoThis view of Mecca during Ramadan shows the Mecca Royal Hotel Clocktower. After nearly three years of oil prices comfortably above US$100/barrel, the Gulf is awash with liquidity and a renewed confidence, similar to that seen in 2006â€‘08, which is manifesting itself in a second construction boom. This is led by publicâ€‘sector driven megaprojects, but there are also a raft of private-sector real estate developments under way. This contrasts with 2009â€‘10, when private-sector construction activity lulled in many countries and a number of major projects were cancelled or put on hold indefinitely. The public sector in most Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) countries continued to spend after the bursting of the regional real estate bubble in late 2008. A recent report by Qatar National Bank showed that capital expenditure recorded in GCC budgets grew in ever year since 2004 (barring a small blip in 2012) and averaged US$115bn in 2011â€‘12, up from US$68bn in 2008. Spending was also higher as a share of GDP, at 7.1% in 2012 compared with 5.7% in 2008. Similarly, output in the regional construction sector has continued to grow in real terms over the last five years, including by around 5% in 2012, and is estimated to be about one-quarter larger than it was in 2008. Looking ahead, public capital spending is expected to remain elevated, with more private-sector activity as well. Project spending figures are hard to forecast given budget overspend and the possibility for both cancellations and the launch of new projects. However, two widely cited estimates give a rough picture of the scale of the market in the GCC. MEED Projects, a service that tracks projects in the region, estimates that the value of ongoing projects in the GCC totals US$1.5trn. Danube Building Materials, a Dubai-based company with regional operations, forecasts that nearly US$900bn will be spent on construction in the GCC up to 2020. Saudi Arabia and Qatar have led the regional boom since the downturn: both their construction sectors have grown at an average of 10% in 2010â€‘12, with signs of acceleration in 2013. In both countries, public-sector spending has led the way as they implement ambitious plans to develop their infrastructure and expand their cities. MEED Projects estimates that around US$200bn will be spent on megaprojects in Qatar in the run-up to the 2022 football World Cup, an acute focal point for many of the infrastructure projects that must be complete in time. One key component of this, the Doha Metro, is finally moving forward, with US$8bn of contracts awarded in June 2013 for the first two lines and their stations scheduled for completion by 2019. It is hoped that lessons will be learnt from the nearly five-year overrun of Hamad International Airport (now slated to open early next year) and applied to the metro, new port and extensive road-building programme. The doubling in Qatar's population in seven years-reaching 2m in September-has driven major real estate developments by private firms such as Barwa. State-owned Qatari Diar is leading the development of the largest project, Lusail City, a US$45bn coastal suburb to the north of the capital, Doha, that is planned to accommodate 200,000 people. Saudi Arabia is also improving its transport infrastructure, with plans for metros in Jeddah and the capital, Riyadh-the latter is moving ahead, with the award in August of management contracts for the six lines. It is also planning the Landbridge, a 950â€‘km railway from Jeddah to Damman, and the Haramain High Speed Rail linking Mecca, Medinah and Jeddah to facilitate the movement of pilgrims. These four rail projects are together expected to cost over US$50bn. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia is improving facilities in the holy cities, including the controversial US$27bn redevelopment of the Grand Mosque in Mecca and new housing projects for pilgrims in both cities. At the same time it is seeding a series of new economic cities to spread the population around the country and diversify the economy. King Abdullah Economic City on the west coast is the most ambitious, with a US$90bn price tag and a nearly complete port. The Saudi private sector is also active, and the foundations are nearing completion on Prince Alwaleed bin Talal's Kingdom Tower in Jeddah which, when complete in 2017, is slated to become the world's tallest building at 1 km in height. He is already talking about building a mile-high building next, although not necessarily in Saudi Arabia. The UAE, particularly Dubai, was the epicentre of the previous construction boom, and the most adversely affected when the global economic crisis burst a bubble in the real estate sector. This was because much of the construction was being undertaken by the private sector or by state-owned developers that were heavily leveraged with debt, rather than being largely funded by hydrocarbons revenue, as in Qatar and Saudi Arabia. When the crash came, it became obvious that many of the planned developments were unrealistic, such as "The World", an archipelago of impractically located artificial islands. Nonetheless, plenty of state-led construction has continued over the last few years, funded by Abu Dhabi's oil revenue. The private sector is now re-engaging, and new grandiose schemes are emerging. In 2012, US$16bn of construction contracts were awarded in the UAE, exceeding Saudi Arabia for the first time since 2008. The largest new scheme is Mohammed bin Rashid City, announced in November 2012 by the eponymous emir of Dubai as a mixed-use development featuring the world's largest mall, a Universal Studios theme park and over 100 hotels. There is already the risk of fresh overreach in the new boom. For example, a few weeks ago a US$1bn island resort off Ras alâ€‘Khaimah, themed around Real Madrid football club and announced in March 2012, was scrapped amid financial problems. The combined construction sectors in Kuwait, Oman and Bahrain are smaller than the one in Qatar. Bahrain and Oman are restricted by their more limited hydrocarbons resources, although Oman is pressing ahead with some ambitious projects, including the development of a new port and city at Duqm in a sparsely populated region. Oman and Bahrain should benefit from US$20bn of infrastructure grants over ten years, as pledged by the four wealthier GCC states in March 2011, at the height of the Arab Spring, in an effort to create jobs and reduce the risks of political instability, although it is unclear how much funding has been provided to date. Kuwait is the odd one out in the world of GCC construction. It has significant hydrocarbons wealth, second only in per capita terms to Qatar, but it largely sat out the last construction boom, as bureaucratic hurdles and political wrangling between the elected parliament and appointed executive delayed even critical infrastructure projects, such as power stations. Its 2010â€‘14 Development Plan was largely stillborn for the same reason. However, there have been signs of renewed life over the last year, with the awarding of long-delayed contracts for the Al Zour power station and the Subiya Causeway across Kuwait Bay. However, although the parliament elected in July appears on the surface to be more pro-government than its recent predecessors, something that would facilitate progress on infrastructure megaprojects, there are also some indications that the next parliamentary term, which starts on October 29th, could see the return of obstructionist dynamics. If the political obstacles could be overcome, which remains doubtful, Kuwait could potentially become a major projects market, given both its wealth and the relative shabbiness of its infrastructure.

Flickr Elvert BarnesOne popular suit-and-tie retailer may soon make its entrance into a whole new realm â€” steak. According to The New York Post's Steve Cuozzo, Brooks Brothers is making plans to open a steakhouse just around the corner from its Madison Avenue flagship store.Â  The restaurant will be located at 11 E. 44th St, a three-story, 15,000 square-foot space, and would tentatively open summer 2014. The brand plans to name their first restaurant "Makers and Merchants," a reference to the company's famous slogan.Â  Brooks Brothers has not yet filed plans with the Buildings Department, nor have they filed a liquor application with the State Liquor Authority, according to The Post.Â  Founded in 1818, Brooks Brothers currently operates 300 stores in the U.S. and worldwide.Â This would be the first restaurant for the company and could be the start of a branded steakhouse line in locations across the country.Â 
REUTERS/Carlos BarriaIn his outgoing presidential speech in late 2012, Hu Jintao warned that failure to tackle corruption could "prove fatal to the party."  Since taking the helm, Xi Jinping has been cracking down on corruption and 'gift-giving.' But the campaign is "barely making a dent," according to William Wan a China correspondent for The Washington Post.Â   Wan points out that in China, children learn about corruption at a very early age, because parents often need to bribe schools to get their children a spot. From Wan: "Almost everything, from admission to grades to teacher recommendations, is negotiable in Chinese schools if you know the right person or have enough cash, parents and teachers say. As a result, many believe, the education system is worsening rather than mending the vast gap between the elite and everyone else in China." While public education in China is expected to be free, parents frequently cough up a small fortune to ensure admission. Wan reports that admission to a "decent Beijing middle school" can cost $16,000 or more in payments or bribes. Sometimes the payment can go up to six figures. And these 'gifts' aren't just in the form of cash. They can including gifts of organic rice to teachers worried about food safety, or medication for a teacher that is sick, buying elevators for schools, or lavish gifts from their travels abroad. For a nation trying to crack down on income inequality, this only widens the gap between the rich and the poor. Wan explains: "Getting into a good middle school means a shot at Beijingâ€™s top high schools. A top high school means proper preparation for Chinaâ€™s infamously rigorous college admissions exam, called the gaokao. "A good gaokao score means a secure job, higher income, better housing, better marriage prospects." Some of these payoffs have even become "semi-legal" Wan reports. For instance, government ministries and state owned enterprises reserve seats for children of their employees through large donations. Some schools also charge a "school choice fee" for students from different school districts, and these can range from $5,000 - $40,000. One self-made businesswoman Yang, told Wan that she didn't save up for such payments and argued that her child would get in on merit alone. At some point she began sending in gift cards of $20 - $30, but these went unnoticed compared to larger sums that other parents could afford. In second grade, when her daughter Qianyi lost out on an award, she blamed her mother for not giving her teacher medication when she was sick. Qianyi claimed another girl won because her mother had. For Xi, this is proof that his campaign against corruption is failing at a grass root level. Read the entire piece at The Washington Post Â»
In recent weeks, a plethora of large money managers have spoken out about the speculative fever in the current market.  The alarm of caution has been heard from Stanley Druckenmiller to Paul Singer, from Seth Klarman to Howard Marks.  All billionaires.  Even Warren Buffett, the eternal optimist, expressed his recent difficulty in finding stock bargains in the current market. The truly cynical might view their words as simply a way to knock stocks lower so that they can buy back in on the cheap.  But the S&amp;P 500 index is up about 50% in the past 2 years, despite minimal earnings growth.  So I’ll take them at their word. Joining the chorus of billionaires this week are Julian Robertson (another billionaire) and Jim Chanos (not quite that rich).  First, Chanos, courtesy of the WSJ: “The problem [with] Tesla and Netflix .. is they have gone beyond an interesting product or innovation, to becoming cult stocks, to becoming sort of investments or speculation despite the fundamentals. “The stock values are so predicated on the future … which is so easy to predict,” he adds a bit sarcastically. “The value is rising really really quickly,” he adds, comparing it to 1999. He notes, as an example, an analyst on Tesla that upgraded the price target this morning, saying only 5% of the price target was based on cash flow before 2020. He says investors are “chasing momentum because it’s working.” But that could have its pitfalls over the long term. In general, Mr. Chanos says the stock market has gotten “extremely speculative” at current levels. He compares it the tech bubble and says the current environment is “almost akin to the day-trading-like market that we had in the late 1990s.” We’ve noted such concerns ourselves, though as we’ve also noted, timing a short sale in such momentum names is very difficult. Robertson tilts to a more macro view, in his interview on CNBC: JULIAN ROBERTSON: That’s really the way I’m looking at stocks primarily now. I think we’re in the middle of a kind of a bubble market, where it’s going to take something– bubble-like to happen. And– prick the bubble and we’ll probably have pretty bad– reactions to the breaking of the bubble. But– probably not right now. And somehow I think we’ll wallow through the political and fiscal crisis we have in front of us. And then we’ll sort of see what happens. Meanwhile, the average retail investor is much more excited today than 2, 3, or 4 years ago, when there were many more business bargains to be had.  I’d rather follow the herd of billionaires myself.  But don’t take my word for it.  Once again, here is G.C. Selden from more than a century ago: It is hard for the average man to oppose what appears to be the general drift of public opinion.  In the stock market this is perhaps harder than elsewhere; for we all realize that the prices of stocks must, in the long run, be controlled by public opinion. The point we fail to remember is that public opinion in a speculative market is measured in dollars, not in population. One man controlling one million dollars has double the weight of five hundred men with one thousand dollars each. Dollars are the horse-power of the markets the mere number of men does not signify. This is why the great body of opinion appears to be bullish at the top and bearish at the bottom. The multitude of small traders must be, as a plain necessity, long when prices are at the top, and short or out of the market at the bottom. The very fact that they are long at the top shows that they have been supplied with stocks from some source. I’d rather follow the billionaires.
This was definitely the headline of the morning from the New York Post: CNBC fires two 'American Greed' staffers for stealing TheÂ New York Post's Claire Atkinson reportsÂ that two CNBC employees were fired for stealing from the financial news behemoth. Â  They didn't actually work on the show "American Greed," which is a true crime series that focuses on white collar crimes (ponzi schemes, bank robbery, embezzlement, money laundering, etc.)Â  They were busted after CNBC set up hidden cameras at its Englewood Cliffs, NJ headquarters to catch the two employees in a "sting" operation, the report said citing a CNBC insider. According to the Post, the female employee was caught taking makeup from the greenroom and reselling it. Â The male employee had set up his own studio side business where he was using CNBC camera equipment, the report said.Â

He recently wrote a letter saying he'll donate $100,000 towards Hurricane Sandy relief if the graffiti artist makes a piece raising awareness for those victims still suffering on the one-year anniversary of the storm.Â  The artist is seven days into a month-long "residency" in New York City, and his works have cropped up everywhere from Chelsea to Bushwick. Banksy did a similar service for Hurricane Katrina victims when he took over New Orleans in 2008, on the three-year anniversary of that storm.Â  "Banksy used his art to show sympathy towards those impacted by Katrina, and we hope he might be willing to to use his art in a legal manner to support those affected by Sandy as well," Saiers said in an email to Business Insider. Here's the letter you can find on Saiers' website:Â  Â  Screenshot, heybanksy.com
If the debt ceiling isn't raised, the federal government will run out of money somewhere between Oct. 22 and Nov. 1. People have been talking a lot about Oct. 17. That's the day the Treasury Department expects to exhaust "extraordinary measures" that allow the government to finance itself without issuing Treasury bonds, such as borrowing from various government trust funds. But even when that happens, the federal government will have about $30 billion in cash left on hand, and every day it will collect more revenue. That means it will be able to go a few more days, or possibly as long as two weeks, without missing payments. Bipartisan Policy CenterThe Bipartisan Policy Center has projected daily cash inflows and outflows and has narrowed the possible range for the "X date"Â â€” the first day the government can't make all its payments dueÂ â€” as Oct. 22 to Nov. 1. Most days in late October, the government will be sending out a little more money than it takes in. But even if we make it all the way to the end of the month, there's no way we'll be able to make the approximately $55 billion in payments that are due on Nov. 1, when Social Security benefits, Medicare provider payments, active duty military pay and military pensions are all scheduled to go out. Of course, that doesn't mean we should let the debt ceiling crisis run right up to Oct. 22. These figures are just projections, and the government could be surprised by unexpectedly low receipts or high payment needs on any given day. It's like if you kept just a few hundred dollars in your checking accountÂ â€” you'd risk bouncing checks. And the failure to raise the debt ceiling is already causing a modest rise in interest rates, which means higher borrowing costs every time the Treasury rolls over outstanding bonds. Last time we made this mess, in 2011, BPC estimates that unnecessarily higher interest rates cost taxpayers $18.9 billion. The costs this time would likely be higher as there's 17% more debt outstanding than two years ago. But those costs pale in comparison to the potential costs of a financial crisis if the federal government actually misses a payment. It's just one more reason Congress should stop screwing around and pass a clean debt limit increase.
APToday could be a significant day of movement on both the government shutdown and debt-ceiling fights. House Republicans met in a closed-door session Tuesday morning, where they outlined their strategy for both of the budget battles.  For now, National Journal's Tim Alberta reports that House Republicans will look to separate the two fights, possibly looking to pass a one-month debt-ceiling hike and keep passing individual funding bills to keep different parts of the government open.  At a 10 a.m. press conference, House GOP leadership's strategy consisted of repeated requests for President Barack Obama to sit down and negotiate. House Speaker John Boehner said he'd be willing to do so without any conditions. "I'm not drawing any lines in the sand," Boehner said. Separately, Senate Democrats could also introduce a bill that would permit a "clean" hike on the debt ceiling, though specifics are still unknown at this point. But according to aides, it would not contain any policy riders and likely raise the nation's borrowing limit through the 2014 election. The House and Senate were both in session at 10 a.m.
(AP Photo/dapd/ Wittek)The German Constitutional Court.The government shutdown in the United States and the prospect of a U.S. debt default are dominating the discussion in financial markets. ISI vice chairman Krishna Guha warns, however, that investors shouldn't forget about the German Constitutional Court, which is expected to rule on the legality of the European Central Bank's program of "Outright Monetary Transactions" (OMT) later this month â€” a policy tool that is said to have brought calm to eurozone (and thus global) markets since the summer of 2012. "We view the upcoming ruling from the German Constitutional Court on the ECBâ€™s OMT program as a bigger tail risk than U.S. government shutdown or default,"Â says Guha in a note to clients. "While the probability of an adverse ruling is low â€“ in the region of 5-10 per cent â€“ the cost of such a ruling for the eurozone and global asset markets would be extremely severe." Guha says a ruling against OMT would bring "redenomination risk" back to eurozone assets â€” the premium investors demand to protect themselves against the risk that peripheral eurozone sovereign bond markets blow up and countries exit the euro. "With the return of redenomination risk, the tentative and partial revival of private sector cross-border financial flows in Europe would swing into reverse," says Guha. "The massive loss of wealth and further constriction of credit supply in the periphery would push these nations back into deep recession. And in this setting, the trigger for fatal, self-fulfilling runs could emerge, whether in the form of political upheavals, bank failures or other endogenous disruptions." So, what are the odds that the German Constitutional Court rules against OMT? Guha lays out three possible scenarios: "Our probability of 5-10 per cent on the risk case is probably somewhat higher than consensus," says Guha. "We get there not because we think there is a sizeable chance that the German Constitutional Court will deliberately torpedo the program, but because it will be difficult for the Court (made up of lawyers not economists) to judge which of the conditions it might require to bring the program into compliance with German law would jeopardize its effectiveness."
The funding for the federal government ran out at the end of the fiscal year, September 30, with the expiration of a continuing resolution that was passed in March of this year. With no agreement on a new funding bill, the federal government has partially shut down. In addition, the Treasuryâ€™s borrowing capacity has been at the current limit since May 2013, although it has employed extraordinary measures that allow it to borrow additional funds without breaching the debt ceiling, which now stands at $16.699 trillion. Those measures will likely be exhausted in the next couple of weeks. Both of these issues have the capacity to weaken the economy and investor confidence.Â  The impasse in Washington may linger this week. But the past week of intraday swings suggests that stocks may rebound sharply when a breakthrough is announced. In the meantime, market declines apply more pressure in D.C. to find a resolution.Â  Key Support Levels and DatesÂ  Market watchers often look for key levels on the major indexes that, when reached, may act to prompt a reversal or a breakdown. Key technical support for the S&amp;P 500 Index can be found between the 50- and 100-day moving averages atÂ 1680 and 1662. Last week, this range held and prompted rebounds. However, if these levels are breached, there may be more downside in store for stocks.Â  We are also focused on key dates on the calendar that could prompt a breakthrough and lead to a rebound for the stock market. But if these dates are breached without a deal, there may be more downside for stocks. Some key dates include: In the event the Treasury runs short of funds, it does not have the explicit authority to pick and choose which debts get paid. The House of Representatives passed a bill earlier this year that would allow the Treasury to continue to make payments on debt to avoid a default and to Social Security recipients in the event of a stalemate over the debt ceiling. However, the Senate did not take up the bill. Nevertheless, there is some ambiguity leading to a range of potential solutions that the Treasury could take. A FIFO, or First In, First Out, method seems to be favored by Treasury officials based on recent statements and comments from back in 2011, when the debt ceiling was last the subject of a battle in Washington. This would suggest each dayâ€™s bills get accumulated along with tax remittances until a full dayâ€™s debts could be paid.Â  Such an approach would result in delays for all, from government contractors to welfare recipients to holders of Treasury bonds, as funds run short.Â  While the threat of spending delays or a default and the accompanying economic drag is worrisome, investors have been used to climbing a wall of worry this year.Â The stock market has easily overcome a series of threats this year, including battles in Washington that resulted in the fiscal cliff tax increases and sequester spending cuts, high oil prices, the Boston bombings, Federal Reserve tapering concerns, downward revisions to earnings growth rates, rising interest rates, an election debacle in Italy, a bank bailout in Cyprus, and rising geopolitical tensions, among others. Yet, investors have found confidence in continued economic growth.Â  Itâ€™s Not All About WashingtonÂ  In this context, it is important to note that last weekâ€™sÂ economic data seemed to matter to the markets as much as the developments in Washington.Â  For example,Â on TuesdayÂ the better-than-expected manufacturing Purchasing Managersâ€™ Index (PMI) report helped to lift stocks while Wednesdayâ€™s disappointing ADP jobs report weighed on stocks, as did Thursdayâ€™s non-manufacturing PMI report.Â On Friday, stocks acted as if job growth exceeded the 180,000 estimate, though no report was released due to the federal government shutdown. This week, some well-known companies report earnings results as we kick off the third quarter reporting season. Companies are likely to post better sales and earnings growth than we have seen during the first two quarters this year, especially withÂ the widely watched and profit-leading PMIs of the United States, Europe, and Japan all above the breakeven level of 50 and rising together for the first time since late 2009/early 2010. The market may welcome positive news on earnings.Â  Selling stocks into short-term political uncertainty has been costly for investors this year as stocks rebounded from shallow dips and the bull market continued. We expect to see a resolution on funding the federal government and lifting the debt ceiling before the Treasury needs to selectively default or delay payments on U.S. obligations. We believe this is not a time to be indiscriminately selling stocks. Instead, for those who are underweight stocks relative to their long-term allocation targets, this may be a time to seek opportunities to buy in anticipation of a continued bull market.
REUTERS/Giampiero SpositoThe head of Italy's largest oil company says Europe is facing unsustainable energy costs that only fracking or increasing Russian imports can address. Speaking Monday at a Council on Foreign Relations event in New York, Eni CEO Paolo Scaroni said Europeans pay twice as much for natural gas as Americans. "To imagine Europe living with such a differential in energy costs seems to me really quite dramatic," Eni CEO said. "I think there's a real emergency on that point." Right now, he said, the U.S. has little incentive to expand natural gas exports to Europe, as lower natural gas prices yielded by the shale boom have boosted America's industrial competitiveness.  "I can't imagine anybody making an energy intensive investment in Europe," he said. Total CEO Christophe de Margerie, who was also part of the panel, echoed Scaroni's comments, saying the American practice of paying royalties to landowners, and the availability of sophisticated, easily transportable drilling equipment would not be replicated across the Atlantic without difficulty. Just this weekend, outgoing Shell CEO Peter Voser told the FT he was pessimistic that shale would get developed to the same extent as it has in America.   Scaroni said he was closely monitoring progress in the U.K., where electricity price spikes have accelerated shale development. "They are the most pragmatic. Europeans love to discuss theory, Brits like to do practice." Assuming fracking does not expand in Europe, the continent will be forced to turn to Russia, he said.  "Looking at where the resources are, and where the consumption is, there's a certain amount of 'force of gravity' which will bring the two sides close to each other."  The EIA has estimated there are 221 trillion cubic feet of technically recoverable shale gas and 8.3 billion technically recoverable shale oil barrels in Western Europe. At the same time, several countries, including France and the Netherlands, have placed moratoriums on fracking. Watch a replay of the full panel here: 
Google ImagesThe International Monetary Fund said a U.S. default would "seriously damage" the global economy, and it lowered its 2013 growth estimates for America, Bloomberg reports. “A longer shutdown could have sizable adverse growth implications,” the IMF said. “A failure to promptly raise the debt ceiling could also adversely affect financial markets and economic activity, with spillovers to the rest of the world.” The Washington, D.C.-based group now sees average U.S. GDP growth of 1.6% for 2013 versus 1.7% prior, and 2014 at 2.6% versus 2.8% prior. It also lowered its global growth forecasts 30 basis points to 2.9% for 2013 and 20 bps to 3.6% for 2014.  India and Mexico saw the largest growth cuts, -180 bps to 5.1% and -170 bps to 3.0% for 2013 respectively. Gallup said this morning that its U.S. economic confidence index plunged to its lowest level in years.
Matthew Boesler/Business Insider, data from BloombergTreasury bill yield curve.Yields on the front end of the Treasury bill curve are blowing out this morning as markets price in higher odds that the disagreement in Congress over raising the debt ceiling will not be resolved in a timely manner. "The Treasury bill market is clearly indicating concern about upcoming debt ceiling deadlines," said Goldman Sachs economist Alec Phillips in a note last week, when the curve was significantly lower. "In our view this is the direct result of the increasing acrimony in Washington. Starting with the bill maturing onÂ October 17â€•the day the Treasury Department has suggested it would exhaust its borrowing authorityâ€•bill rates are elevated, suggesting lower investor appetite for holding these securities. The distortion in the bill curve is most apparent in the security maturing onÂ October 31,Â just after Treasury is likely to have depleted its cash balance. This unusual 'humped' pattern is similar to that seen in late July 2011 during the last debt ceiling standoff." The chart below shows the spike in T-bill yields.

Chasing IceU.S. economic confidence plunged more in the past week than in any week since the collapse of Lehman Brothers on September 15, 2008 â€” the catalyst for the financial crisis and U.S. recession. Gallup's Economic Confidence Index fell 12 points to -34 last week thanks to the government shutdown. Fiscal brinksmanship has been a major drain on economic confidence in the past. According to Gallup: Gallup's Economic Confidence IndexÂ fell nine points in late February and early March 2013Â as Congress and President Barack Obama failed to reach an agreement to avoid automatic federal spending cuts as part of sequestration. Economic confidence fell eight points during the week ending Feb. 20, 2011, as Congress and the president reached an agreement on the federal budget at the last minute, avoiding a government shutdown. But Gallup noted that confidence tends to rebound within weeks of fiscal debates, suggesting that this episode (if solved) will not have the same long term drag as, say, the 2008-2009 recession.

Mike Ehrmann / Getty ImagesJohn Wall at the Rising Stars ChallengeDuring a panel discussion at the Commodities Week conference in London today, Jeffrey Currie, head of commodities research at Goldman Sachs, called gold and other precious metals a "slam-dunk" sell once the current fiscal crisis in Washington is resolved. Whitney McFerron at Bloomberg News has the comments: "Once we get past this stalemate in Washington, precious metals are a slam dunk sell at that point," Currie said. "You have to argue that with significant recovery in the U.S., tapering of QE should put downward pressure on gold prices." Goldman has long been bearish on gold prices, especially as long-term interest rates have risen in 2013. However, in a September 19 note to clients following the Federal Reserve's surprise decision to refrain from tapering back its quantitative easing program, Currie said the risks to gold were "skewed to the upside in the near term," citing the Fed decision and the upcoming debt ceiling debate.
Wikimedia CommonsPort Elizabeth, New JerseyThe government shutdown means the Commerce Department isn't releasing regularly scheduled economic data, which means we don't get the August trade balance report that was supposed to be released at 8:30 AM today. Had the report been released, the consensus forecast among market economists was for a slight increase in the trade deficit to $39.5 billion from July's $39.1 billion deficit. Luckily, regular economic data releases put out by the private sector also track trade metrics. Ambitious economy-watchers can also look at trade data from America's trading partners. Below are a few datapoints that give an idea of what the international trade picture looked like in August. Below is some commentary from the market economists: CIBC's Andrew Grantham: "We don’t expect much divergence in the volume of exports and imports for August, with both on modestly improving trends. That should leave relative prices as the main determinant of the trade deficit. Import prices were flat on the month, while export prices fell. The result should be a modest widening of the trade deficit to $40.2 bn."
The U.S. government may be shut down. But the Federal Reserve isn't. On Wednesday, the Fed will be publishing the minutes of its September Federal Open Market Committee meeting. But ahead of that, two Fed presidents will be making comments today about the economy and monetary policy that could move markets. Here's a quick preview from Morgan Stanley's Hans Redekar: Fed talk ahead of the minutes. The Fedâ€™s Plosser and Pianalto will be speaking today. While both are non-voters, their assessment of the policy outlook is likely to be of interest to the markets, especially ahead of the FOMC minutes, which are due for release tomorrow. The market will be sensitive to any assessment regarding the impact of the current shutdown on the policy path and whether tapering of QE could be delayed further by a prolonged government shutdown. Plosser has been on the hawkish side of the argument, calling for tapering to start early. Hence, it will be interest to see if Plosser maintains this stance in light of recent events. As for the FOMC minutes tomorrow, the market will be weighing up how close the call was to delay tapering while also assessing whether the delay is a function of the recent weaker data and the fiscal deadlock, or a structural shift to a more dovish stance, perhaps representing a transition towards a Yellen-led Fed. Cleveland Fed President Sandra Pianalto will be speaking on monetary policy in Pittsburgh at 12:25 p.m. ET and Philly Fed President Charles Plosser will be speaking on the economy at 12:30 p.m. ET.
Legendary corporate raider Carl Icahn is changing the game when it comes to communicating his positions. In recent months, he has taken to Twitter. And just moments ago he tweeted about Nuance Communications. "Happy to have reached an agreement with Nuance Communications where Dave Schechter and Brett Icahn will join the board of directors," Icahn tweeted. "I'm optimistic their impact at NUAN will be similar to HAIN, where stock went from $20.20 to $79.56 over the 3 years they sat on the board." Icahn recently raised his stake in Nuance, a developer of speech-recognition software. There had already been speculation that Icahn would seek seats on Nuance's board. So today's tweets come as no surprise. @Carl_C_Icahn

Wikipedia CommonsThe debt ceiling will be hit on Oct. 17. That might seem soon, but in politics it's ages away. There are a million stunts to pull yet. Lots of non-starters. But let's say there is ultimately a deal in some way to get past this, what's something both sides might agree on? Greg Valliere at Potomac Research Group breaks it down: SO . . . IF WE COULD PLAY GOD FOR A DAY here's what a deal would look like: an immediate end of the shut-down; a $1 trillion debt ceiling increase; the easing or abolition of the sequester; and no major changes to Obamacare.  That's what the Democrats would get.  For the Republicans: major entitlement reforms, including a change in the Social Security COLA; approval of the Keystone pipeline; a binding commitment to tax reform; and perhaps abolition of the device tax (that would cost $30 billion over ten years and might be paid for by cracking down on some tax breaks like carried interest).  Valliere goes onto note that we're nowhere even close to any of this. And the left and right wings of both parties would have a conniption. But theoretically, that's a plausible agreement. Bigger picture, this gets at the difference between 2013 and 2011. In 2011, the two sides were gulfs apart, but they were actively working on closing that gap for months. In 2013, the sides are just as far apart, but there's zero effort being made to close the gap.
Laenulfean / FlickrMiller Tabak chief technical market analyst Jonathan Krinsky says the S&amp;P 500 is at a "critical juncture." Krinsky points out that yesterday, the index was sitting at basically the same levels as last Monday, despite gyrations throughout the week. In a note to clients yesterday, Krinsky wrote: As a result, S&amp;P Futures appear to be at a make or break juncture, in our view. The continuous contract, ES1, is testing the rising trend-line off the November 2012 lows for the 4th time. A clear break likely sets up a re-test of the August lows, around 1625, or more than 2% lower.  Of course, the bull thesis here, is that we have yet to break last weekâ€™s lows (1663.25), and the recent pullback to trend creates a nice buying opportunity. Assuming we use those lows as a stop, we cannot argue with the risk/reward at this level. First upside resistance would be in the area of the Thursday and Friday failing rallies, or 1685-1686. Overnight, futures did break last week's lows, but just barely â€” falling to 1662.75. However, this morning, futures are right back up at that 1667 level, where they were yesterday as well as last Monday.

REUTERS/Jason Reed With no guided tours due to the U.S. Government shut down, a U.S. Capitol police officer stands in front of paintings in the Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol in Washington.Good morning! Here's what you need to know.
Numerous economists have commented how this lack of economic information will make the Federal Reserve’s management of monetary policy all the more difficult. I respectfully disagree. I believe that the lack of official federal government economic statistics might actually enhance the Fed’s management of monetary policy.  Let me explain. Milton Friedman, may he rest in peace, used to argue that the pursuit of discretionary policy actions by the Fed actually increases the amplitude of a business cycle. In other words, discretionary monetary policy tends to reinforce booms and busts. Increasing the amplitude of a business cycle, of course, is not the intent of discretionary Fed policy, but an unfortunate outcome because of insufficient knowledge on the part of the Fed and, for that matter, all mortals. The Fed lacks sufficient knowledge with respect to the lagged effects of a policy action. Sometimes a policy action might have its maximum effect on the economy in three months; sometimes in six months. Even if it knew with certainty when a policy action would have its maximum effect on the economy, the Fed often knows too late when such action would be called for. Most of the economic data, official federal government or otherwise, the Fed uses to assess the performance of the economy are available only with a lag, typically a lag of a month or a quarter. And then all of the important official federal government economic data gets revised, often significantly revised and often revised over and over again for several years thereafter. An example of the revisions to key measure of economic performance, the quarter-to-quarter annualized growth in real GDP, is shown in Chart 1. The EcontrarianChart 1 Shown are two estimates of annualized growth in real GDP for each of the four quarters in 2007. The red bars represent real GDP growth as estimated in January 2008. The blue bars represent real GDP growth for these same 2007 four quarters as estimated in September 2013. In each of the first three quarters of 2007, the estimates of real GDP growth available to the Fed in January 2008 were higher than the estimates available currently. The largest overestimate of real GDP growth occurred for Q3:2007, where the January 2008 estimate was 219 basis points above the current estimate. Mind you, that January 2008 estimate of Q3:2007 real GDP growth was already the third revision of the October 2007 first guess by the Bureau of Economic Analysis of Q3:2007 real GDP growth. To the Fed’s credit, the majority of FOMC members in January 2008 based their policy decisions on the mounting dysfunctional behavior of the financial markets rather than ephemeral coincident indicators such as real GDP growth. But this example highlights how misleading “real-time” federal government economic statistics can be. Even if the economic data provided by the federal government were more timely and subject to less revision, they still might not justify discretionary Fed monetary policy. Bear in mind, monetary policy affects the demand for goods, services and assets — not the supply. Negative supply shocks to the economy, such as a foreign oil embargo, will reduce the production or supply of real goods and services. If the Fed were to respond to weaker real output resulting from a negative supply shock by taking actions to stimulate aggregate demand, higher inflation would be the ultimate result, not higher real output. Sometimes, it is difficult to disentangle the effects on real output from simultaneous supply and demand shocks. But regardless of whether a decline in output occurs because of a negative demand shock or negative supply shock, the political pressure usually mounts on the Fed to “do something.” Instead of pursuing discretionary monetary policies, Milton Friedman suggested that the Fed adopt a rules-based approach to policy. Friedman favored a rule for some steady growth in the nation’s money supply. He did not believe that a steady rate of growth in the money supply would eliminate business cycle booms and busts. He did believe, however, that such a rule, if adhered to, would dampen the amplitude of cycle booms and busts. My interpretation of Friedman’s rule is for the Fed first to do no harm. As much as I respect and admire the scholarly economic research conducted by Milton Friedman, I would humbly offer a “tweak” to his monetary rule. Rather than the Fed pursuing a policy resulting in some steady rate of growth in the money supply, I would suggest that the Fed attempt to produce a steady rate of growth in the sum of the credit it creates and the credit created by depository institutions, i.e., commercial banks, savings associations and credit unions. If there are any regular readers of my commentaries — heck, if there are any readers of my commentary — you might remember that I call this credit sum “thin-air” credit. Why the term “thin-air” credit? When the Fed purchases securities or makes a loan, it pays for these asset acquisitions with funds created figuratively out of thin air. Similarly, in a fractional reserve requirement environment, when the depository institution system adds loans and securities to its assets, it “pays” for these asset acquisitions with funds created figuratively out of thin air. Friedman’s concept of the money supply is a subset of the total liabilities of the depository institution system. My concept of depository institution system thin-air credit is a subset of total assets of the depository institution system. Because assets equal liabilities plus net worth, our two concepts are similar so long as the ratio of money supply liabilities to depository institution credit remains relatively stable. The EcontrarianChart 2 Chart 2 indicates that this ratio has been anything but stable over the post-WWII period. Checkable deposits, savings deposits and small time deposits of depository institutions, the bulk of the M-2 money supply, as a percentage of loans and securities on the books of depository institutions has ranged from a high of 101.4% in Q1:1952 to a low of 54.6% in Q4:2007. So, which variable has a closer relationship to nominal domestic purchases of currently-produced goods and services, i.e., gross domestic purchases, the M-2 money supply or the sum of Federal Reserve and depository institution credit? Plotted in Chart 3 are the quarter vs. year-ago quarter changes in nominal gross domestic purchases vs. the nominal M-2 money supply. The correlation between the two from Q1:1960 through Q2:2013 is 0.36 out of a maximum possible 1.00. In Chart 4, substituted for the changes in the M-2 money supply are changes in total thin-air credit, i.e., the sum of Federal Reserve and depository institution credit. The correlation between changes in nominal gross domestic purchases vs. nominal total thin-air credit is 0.58. So, it would appear that if the Fed were to pursue a rule of a steady rate of growth in monetary variable, total thin-air credit would be superior to the M-2 money supply. The EcontrarianChart 3 The EcontrarianChart 4 Now, only an absolutist (moi?) would recommend that the Fed pursue a rule of promoting a steady rate of growth in thin-air credit with total disregard to the performance of the economy. But are there available indicators of aggregate economic performance that are not generated by federal government bean counters, not subject to a lot of revisions and yet comport with official federal government economic statistics after revision? You betcha. Let’s look at some of them. The Institute of Supply Management releases on the first business day of each month its composite Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) pertaining to manufacturing firms. The purchasing managers at these firms are polled with regard to their new orders, production, employment, inventories and supplier deliveries (the speed at which suppliers fill and ship orders). Currently, PMI is an equal-weighted average of these five sub-diffusion indices. The higher the value of the PMI, the stronger is economic activity. Importantly, the not-seasonally-adjusted values of the sub-indexes are never revised. As shown in Chart 5, from 1948 through 2012, the correlation between the percent change in revised annual average real GDP and the unrevised annual average PMI is 0.73 out of a maximum possible 1.00. So, no, the PMI will not tell the Fed that real GDP is growing at X.X%, but it will tell the Fed whether economic conditions are strengthening or weakening. And, as important, the message conveyed by the PMI will not be revised next month, next year or next century. The EcontrarianChart 5 If the PMI does not suit you in gauging the strength and direction of economic activity, try sales of autos and light trucks. Chart 6 shows that there is a 0.73 positive correlation between the percent change in revised annual average real GDP and annual average light weight vehicle sales. I purposely used in Chart 6 the light weight motor vehicle sales data generated by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, a division of the Commerce Department, because of the length of the series. Of course, these data will not be available again until the Commerce Department re-opens for business, so to speak. But the Fed really does not need the BEA’s estimate of light weight vehicle sales because Autodata Corporation, a private automotive research firm, provides almost identical data to those of the BEA (see Chart 7). To the best of my knowledge, Autodata Corporation’s light weight vehicle sales data, which are derived directly from the very corporations who sell cars and trucks in the U.S., never get revised. The EcontrarianChart 6 The EcontrarianChart 7 Economists were saved from the embarrassment of being wrong again in their forecasts of the monthly change in non-farm payrolls this past Friday because the government shutdown prevented the release of the September employment report. But without this monthly report generated by the federal government, how can the Fed know where it stands in meeting one of its mandates, full employment? How about using the data collected by the states enumerating how many people are collecting state unemployment insurance benefits? Chart 8 shows that there is a negative correlation of 0.66 between the percent change in the annual average of revised non-farm payrolls and the percent change in the annual average of revised continuing state unemployment insurance claims. The EcontrarianChart 8 Even if the federally-generated non-farm payroll data were available, the Fed would be wise to rely more on the state-enumerated continuing claims data. Why? For starters, the unemployment insurance claims data are not derived from sample. These data are the universe of real people collecting real unemployment benefits. The claims data contain no business birth/death adjustments or other imprecise elements that mainly serve to excite conspiracy theorists. Admittedly, because a government entity is counting the real people standing in real lines, the first count is usually inaccurate. But after about four weeks, the state governments have corrected their errors and there are no more revisions. If only that were the case with regard to revisions for the monthly Bureau of Labor Statistics non-farm payroll estimates! Because residential real estate is such a “credit intensive” sector of the economy and because Fed monetary policy has such a large effect on credit conditions, it would be natural for the Fed to want to monitor supply and demand conditions in the housing market. But where could the Fed turn to in the absence of official federal government housing starts and new home sales data? To the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB), that’s where. Each month the NAHB surveys its members with regard to their sales of new homes. Members are asked whether sales are good or poor. If all members responded “good”, the NAHB diffusion index would be 100. If half respond “good” and the other half respond “poor”, the index number would be 50. Chart 9 shows that the correlation between monthly revised single-family housing starts and the monthly NAHB diffusion index of single-family new home sales is 0.84. Chart 10 shows that the correlation between monthly revised single-family new home sales and the monthly NAHB diffusion index of single-family new home sales is 0.76. Any revisions to the NAHB index are small and limited compared to the magnitude and frequency of revision to the other government-generated series. The EcontrarianChart 9 The EcontrarianChart 10 In summary, the Federal Reserve has more than enough information to conduct a proper monetary policy in the absence of official federal government economic data. The Fed should back away from its attempts to micro manage the business cycle, which Greenspan popularized. There was a time when the Fed was so “neutral” in its effect on the business cycle that the average informed woman or man on the street did not know the name of the Fed chairman. If the Fed were to adopt an operating policy of achieving a steady rate of growth in nominal thin-air credit, it could return to its prior anonymity. For reality checks as to how the economy is performing, the Fed could monitor the behavior of quarterly averages of the PMI manufacturing index, car and truck sales, state unemployment insurance benefit claims and the NAHB diffusion index of new home sales. Reasonable people can debate the costs to society of the current federal government shutdown. Call me unreasonable if you want, but I do not believe society has lost much from the suspension of the releases of federal government economic statistics.
It's been observed that equity markets have been pretty chill about the whole debt ceiling/default thing. But there are some signs of weakness creeping in. From aÂ note to clients last night from Dan Greenhaus (@danBTIG) of BTIG: Â The (modest) losses keep mounting. The S&amp;P is now down in ten of its last thirteen sessions (-2.9%) while the Russell 2000 is off its high from last Tuesday by just 2.0%. Discretionary badly underperformed today as the six of the worst seven names in the entire S&amp;P (URBN, MAT, ANF, TRIP, GCI and BBY) come from this corner of the market. Defensives had a strong showing as telecom finished in the green and utilities and staples held in there thanks to FE/ED and KRFT/tobacco names respectively. There was little incremental Washington news today (though the Republican disapproval rating did hit 70% and some defense companies, which fell 3-5% last week, reacted positively to news that workers would be recalled) although poor Asian equity performance (which we alluded to last evening) set the dayâ€™s tone.
Daniel Berehulak/Getty ImagesFrom Calculated Risk, here are two economic data points that we were scheduled to get today, but which we won't thanks to the government shutdown. • DELAYED: At 8:30 AM, the Trade Balance report for August from the Census Bureau. The consensus is for the U.S. trade deficit to increase to $40.0 billion in August from $39.1 billion in July. • DELAYED 10:00 AM, the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey for August from the BLS.   These two reports aren't huge, top-shelf data points, but each tend to be pretty interesting. Trade numbers are crucial for all kinds of reasons, including getting a handle on the entire world's economy. And the Job Openings And Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) tells us all kinds of things about the labor market that we don't get from normal trade numbers.
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Democrats controlling the Senate are planning to try to pass a stand-alone measure to increase the government's borrowing cap, challenging Republicans to a filibuster showdown that could unnerve financial markets as the deadline to a first-ever default on U.S. obligations draws closer. A spokesman said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid could unveil the measure as early as Tuesday, setting the table for a test vote later in the week. The measure is expected to provide enough borrowing room to last beyond next year's election, which means it likely will permit $1 trillion or more in new borrowing above the current $16.7 trillion debt ceiling that the administration says will be hit on Oct. 17. The development came as a partial shutdown of the government enters its second week with no end in sight. It's not clear whether Reid's gambit will work. Republicans are expected to oppose the measure if it doesn't contain budget cuts to make a dent in deficits. The question is whether Republicans will filibuster the measure. Until recently, debt limit increases have not been the target of filibusters; the first in memory came four years ago, when Democrats controlled the Senate with a filibuster-proof 60 votes. Many Republicans in the Senate, including Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Whip John Cornyn of Texas, have voted for so-called clean debt limit increases during Republican administrations. Some Republicans seemed wary of participating in a filibuster that could rattle the stock and bond markets. "We shouldn't be dismissing anything out of hand, whether it's the debt ceiling or what we're going to do with this government shutdown," Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said. "We've got a situation where you've got a calendar running, you've got people who are frustrated and upset, so let's figure it out." The impasse over the shutdown â€” sparked by House Republicans' insistence that a temporary funding bill contain concessions on President Barack Obama's health care law â€” shows no signs of breaking, as each side sticks to its guns and repeats its talking points. Democrats from Obama on down to the most junior lawmakers said again that the House should vote immediately on ending the partial closure of the government. Obama said House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, "doesn't apparently want to see the ... shutdown end at the moment, unless he's able to extract concessions that don't have anything to do with the budget." Boehner, in rebuttal, called on Obama to agree to negotiations on changes in "Obamacare" and steps to curb deficits, the principal GOP demands for ending the shutdown that began with the Oct. 1 beginning of the new fiscal year, and eliminating the threat of default. "Really, Mr. President. It's time to have that conversation before our economy is put further at risk," Boehner said on the House floor. The White House has said repeatedly the president will not negotiate with Republicans until the government is fully reopened and the debt limit has been raised. But it hasn't said the debt limit measure has to be completely "clean" of add-ons. White House aide Jason Furman told reporters the White House could accept some add-ons if Boehner "needs to have some talking point for his caucus that's consistent with us not negotiating ... that's not adding a bunch of extraneous conditions." Another White House official, Gene Sperling, said the administration could be open to an interim, short-term debt limit extension to prevent a catastrophic default. Republicans were sticking with a strategy of trying to pin the blame for the shutdown on Obama for being unwilling to negotiate. The House also passed legislation Monday to reopen the Food and Drug Administration, the latest in a series of piecemeal funding bills to advance through the GOP-controlled chamber. It's been commonly assumed that Republicans would suffer politically from the shutdown and the early polling data seems to bear that out. A survey released Monday by The Washington Post and ABC News said disapproval of Republican handling of the budget showdown was measured at 70 percent, up from 63 percent a week earlier. Disapproval of Obama's role was statistically unchanged at 51 percent. Meanwhile some 350,000 civilian Defense Department workers were summoned back to work Monday as the result of legislation Congress passed and Obama signed after the shutdown began. Other agencies, like NASA and the Environmental Protection Agency, remain mostly shuttered. Copyright (2013) Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Thanks to the government shutdown, there's no government economic data, which is going to make it harder to get a read on what the shutdown is doing to the economy. Fortunately there's a slew of data collected by the private sector, whether it's the ADP Jobs Report or the ISM Manufacturing surveys. And there's this: The Gallup daily tracker of U.S. Economic Confidence, which asks a rolling pool of 1,500 adults how they see the economy. It has fallen off a cliff. Gallup
Wikimedia CommonsMarkets are taking a breather. After tumbling yesterday around the world, stocks aren't doing much of anything today. U.S. futures are flat. Europe is flat. Yesterday was probably the most panicked day yet in terms of the tone coming out of Washington D.C. with regard to the debt ceiling. There's still a huge gulf in how political people see what's going on (very worried) and how market people see what's going on (only kind of worried).
