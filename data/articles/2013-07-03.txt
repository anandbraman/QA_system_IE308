According to a new report from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, the company was responsible for 2/3rds of documented shale wells drilled in 2012 — 53 of 85. Compare this with Pennsylvania, where dozens of different companies have drilled the more than 2,300 wells in the Marcellus Shale. Here's another view, showing all Utica permits through December, via Fractracker: FracTracker Until recently, relying on this particular company might have spelled trouble — longtime CEO Aubrey McClendon was forced to step down after a series of reports about conflict of interest — analysts now say its outlook has stabilized. And the company's stake in the state is set to grow even further, according to the Akron Beacon: Chesapeake had said earlier that it expects to quadruple its Ohio production by the end of 2013 with the completion of pipelines and processing plants that will allow more wells to be hooked up plus new wells drilled in 2013. The company was basically first into the area, and so its vaunted "land machine" was able to snap lots of potential production areas. Ohio's unemployment rate is now lower than the rest of the country's: FRED It's now clear that trend will to a significant degree depend on Chesapeake's fortunes.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve said on Wednesday that Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke would make a speech in Cambridge, Massachusetts, next week on the central bank's 100-year history, its policy record, lessoned learned and prospects for the future. The announcement of his appearance on July 10 at 4:10 p.m. EDT (2010 GMT), at a conference hosted by the National Bureau of Economic Research, was released in a regular update of the Fed's schedule for upcoming official events. Financial markets are on red alert for any hints on the direction of monetary policy after the chairman said on June 19 that officials expect to begin scaling back monthly bond purchases later this year from a current $85 billion pace, provided the economy develops as they expect. That sent stock markets plunging and put sharp upward pressure on bond yields, which was stemmed only after other Fed officials pushed back hard in speeches last week, saying investors were over-reacting to Bernanke's remarks. The Fed said Bernanke would answer questions from the audience after delivering his speech next Wednesday, which is taking place several hours after publication of the minutes of last month's policy-setting meeting.

What The DOMA Ruling Means For Financial Advisors (Wall Street Journal) Financial advisors are wondering what the Supreme Court's historic decision overturning the Defense of Marriage Act will do to business. For some firms that offered niche estate planning for same-sex couples, the decision — which effectively extends to gay couples the same federal tax breaks that heterosexual couples enjoy — might actually harm short-term business. Still, plenty of firms could get new clients now that federal marriage rules will encompass more Americans.  Advisors could also benefit from some of ambiguity surrounding the ruling, since it still isn't clear if same-sex partners will be recognized by states that don't acknowledge gay marriage, if the couple married in another state that does recognize it.  Now Might Be A Good Time To Buy Junk Bonds (BlackRock) With interest rates surging and bonds undergoing a massive sell-off in recent weeks, now might be just the right time to get in on junk bonds once again. "High yield has been a popular trade for several years given the economic recovery and low default rate," write the analysts at BlackRock. "With the recent shift in interest rates and the economy still growing, the sector is attractive. Can investors continue to reap returns? We believe so." BlackRockHere Are 3 Reasons Why You Should Still Own Bonds (Vanguard) Keep holding onto Treasuries, says Vanguard's Joe Davis. Here's why: 1.It has taken time for interest rates to rise. So just because they are low it doesn't mean that they will jump over the next two days. 2. "Secondly is that with low interest rates, that did imply muted return for bond portfolios over the next several years, and that there was more risk of a one-year or one-month loss going forward than there had been over the past 30 or 40 years just because the low-income cushions in those portfolios, and that has played out at least in the past day or two." 3. "Bonds are just inherently, as a broad asset class, less volatile than equities, and that played out yesterday."  FINRA Increased Enforcement in 2012 (Financial Planning) 2012 was a banner year for FINRA, which brought a grand total of 1,541 disciplinary actions. The self-regulator took home almost $70 million in fines, and ordered $34 million in restitution to investors. According to its annual report, the regulator expelled 30 firms, 294 individuals, and suspended another 549. Medicare Related Mistakes Can Really Hurt Retirees (FA Mag) Financial advisors should be well versed on Medicare and related insurance plans — such as Medicare Advantage — before advising clients, according to Brian Hanby who heads a Utah-based insurance agency. "A lot of people do not realize how much health care can cost even with Medicare. It can be a nightmare if you have serious health problems,” Hanby told FA Mag.
Investors head to the emerging markets (EMs) for the opportunity to earn big returns.Â  Of course, those big opportunities also come with the risk of big losses. This year's sell-off in EM stocks, bonds and currencies has been particularly brutal with countries like China, Russia, and Brazil deep in the red. When you consider EM stocks relative to developed market (DM) stocks, you'll notice that the former has been a major underperformer for years. "Except a short patch during the financial crisis of 2007-8, the period from end-2010 to present marks the only episode during which EM equities have consistently underperformed for over ten years," write Deutsche Bank's Priyal Mulji and John-Paul Smith.Â  "The EM underperformance gap versus DM has persistently widened over 2013." "Whilst we do not anticipate that EM equities will give back all of their relative outperformance since 2001, we do think that we are in the middle of a multi-year 10 relative bear market against DM equities, led by the US, which has long been our preferred market," they added And you can blame the world's second biggest economy. "The driving force behind the next leg down in GEM is likely to be a further deterioration in the Chinese economy, whose weakness is already having a pronounced effect on commodity prices. Our best guess is that EM equities may underperform their US peers by up to 50% before the cycle is over, but the precise outcome is dependent on a number of variables, most notably government policies, which are hard to predict, and on the outlook for DM economies."

YouTubeLast night, ex-NYU professor Heleen Mees was arrested for allegedly stalking and harassing chief Citi economist Willem Buiter. We later found out that the two were apparently acquainted at least as far back as 2008, as Mees describes a meeting that year with Buiter as the starting point for her doctoral thesis on China and the financial crisis in its preface.  She also devotes a full page to dedicating it, "For Willem."  NYU appears to be scrubbing Mees' presence wherever it can, taking down her faculty page, as well as her thesis after we published a link to it on the Wagner school's website.   Here's the thesis they don't want you to see (still available online here as well): Heleen Mees Changing Fortunes 
This better data series measures the spread on the 5-year CDS (credit default swap). It is a good – not perfect – market indicator of sovereign risk; and it dominates the information content provided by the much more popular stock market index. The higher the spread (and it just traded at around 1,000 basis points), the harder it is to encourage investment in new plant and equipment; the more difficult and expensive it is to secure trade financing (including for critical imports of food stuffs and other basic needs); and the lower the job and income opportunities for average Egyptians. And all this speaks to the bigger issue: A struggling economy is both a source and a consequence of Egypt’s current political tensions. As insightful as this data series is, it does not capture however the potential spillover effects. Indeed, even the analytics of this particular contagion question is quite complex. Measured by traditional economic and financial variables, Egypt’s regional and global network effects are quite limited. This is true in terms of the usual measures, including trade links, global demand and supply influences and cross-border financial interactions. But this does not mean that Egypt has no systemic effects. It remains the largest and most influential country in the Arab region. It is a significant geo-political actor in an important part of the world. And the demonstration effects could extend quite far and wide. The bad news is that there is no single simple measure that comes anywhere near to capturing all this. The good news is that the CDS spread provides useful insights into one of the underlying contributing factors.
REUTERS/Mike BlakeU.S. sailors unravel a huge American flag across the field during opening day ceremonies before the San Diego Padres host the Los Angeles Dodgers in their MLB National League baseball game in San Diego, California, April 9, 2013. It was a half-day in the stock market. First, the scoreboard: And now, the top stories:
The S&amp;P 500 Index, represented by the ETF (exchange-traded fund) whose symbol is SPY (SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF), had a total return of 13.74% for the first six months of the year. The performance is one of the best first halves in recent times. If one examines the S&amp;P 400 Mid Cap Index for the same period, the result is 13.81% when calculated using the ETF whose symbol is MDY (SPDR S&amp;P Mid Cap 400 ETF). Most notable is the outperformance of small-cap stocks. The S&amp;P 600 Small Cap Index is captured by the ETF whose symbol is IJR (iShares Core S&amp;P Small Cap ETF). That security had a total return of 16.29% for the first half of the year. Thus, approximately 2.5 additional points of return were obtained by representative diversification into small caps versus mid caps and large caps. Note we are still within the S&amp;P 1500 Index. The stocks that make up this index pass the screening and selection committee of Standard &amp; Poor's. We will keep this commentary focused on the S&amp;P 1500. That said, there is ample evidence in other sections of the nearly 6000 tradable stocks that dramatic underperformance or outperformance occurred. One of the pronounced features of this year's first half is the persistent outperformance of revenue-weighted indices over capitalization-weighted indices. One can reach into the same stock market index basket using RevenueShares ETFs rather than the standard capitalization-weighted references from S&amp;P. For example, RevenueShare Small Cap ETF (RWJ) had a performance for the first half of the year of 16.84% versus IJR at 16.29%. In other words, if you selected a revenue-weighted ETF structure versus a capitalization-weighted ETF structure in the small-cap arena, you would have added another 60 basis points to your returns for the first half of 2013. This difference gets more dramatic when you look at the Mid Cap 400 Index. RevenueShares Mid Cap (RWK) delivered a 19.42% total return versus the capitalization-weighted MDY return of 13.81%. A total return 5.61% higher was a dramatic gain to be realized by using RevenueShares rather than capitalization weighting in the mid-cap sector. Mid caps by capitalization weight were essentially the same as large caps. The revenue-weighted ETF dramatically outperformed the cap-weighted one. What about RevenueShares Large Cap? Here too, revenue weighting added excess return to an investor's portfolio. Let's compare RevenueShares Large Cap ETF (RWL) with its cap-weighted cousin (SPY). The total return of RWL for the first half of 2013 was 17.11%. The return for SPY was 13.74% for the capitalization-weighted distribution of the same stocks. In other words, you netted about 3.5 more points of return in six months by using a revenue-weighted ETF rather than a capitalization-weighted ETF. RevenueShares ETFs had a stellar first half. They outperformed capitalization-weighted ETFs in small, mid, and large caps, though the component stocks within each of the ETFs are essentially the same. The major difference between the two ETFs is the stock weighting system used within them. A note for readers and clients: Sometimes we get lucky. In the interest of full disclosure, which in this case is pleasant to offer, Cumberland Advisors can accurately say it is a holder of the RevenueShares Large Cap ETF (RWL) and Small Cap ETF (RWJ). We do not hold the RevenueShares Mid Cap ETF. Oh, well, you cannot win all of them.
APBelgium's Crown Prince Philippe and wife Mathilde The 79-year-old King Albert of Belgium has told the country that he will be abdicating the throne, according to the Associated Press. However, the next king of Belgium may be a somewhat controversial choice â€” Albert's 53-year-old, Oxford and Stanford-educated son, Crown Prince Philippe. While Philippe has all the hallmarks of a European royal, including time in the military and education at some of the world's best institutions, rumors about his personal life have followed him for years. While Philippe was already known as a somewhat shy and awkward man, a book published last year by journalist Frederic Deborsu entitled "Royal Questions" raised questions about his sexuality, putting forward rumors that his 1999 wedding to Mathilde d'Udekem d'AcozÂ was a "forced marriage" for Philippe, who had been expected to remain a bachelor, and that his children were born after visits to a clinic that specializes in "artificial procreation." According to the Associated Press, the book prompted a rare public denial from the Belgian royal family. "The day that Mathilde said 'Yes' to my proposal was the happiest day of my life," Philippe said in a statement. The role of the Royal family in Belgium is unusually complicated due to their perceived ability to unite the country's political, linguistic and geographic split â€” a split that led to the country having no government for more than 500 days just a couple of years ago.
Photo: The Patriots/Jim JohnsonWhether it's on the football field or Wall Street, Eugene Profit knows how to play the game. Profit, a Yale University graduate with a bachelor's degree in economics and a former cornerback for the New England Patriots and the Washington Redskins, entered the financial sector in 1991 when he was forced to retire from the NFL due to a torn hamstring. He started as a financial consultant at Legg Mason and left the company in 1996 to found Profit Investments, a money management firm based in Washington, D.C., that serves institutional and retail clients. U.S. News recently spoke with Profit, 48, about his passion for finance, what the NFL taught him about money and how the company he founded 15 years ago with $300,000 in assets under management has grown to nearly $2 billion today. His responses have been edited. What was it like making the transition from the NFL to Wall Street? Any transition from a sports league to something else is extraordinarily difficult. You go from being in this world where there's this degree of exposure and popularity. You've been used to having structured schedules and structured goals in your life. Then you transition over into this world of complete freedom and isolation. I think that's a pretty big adjustment. And don't forget that, in most cases, you're pretty young when this transition occurs. What did you tell Emmitt Thomas, the Redskins position coach, when he asked you during your last year in the NFL whether you're going into coaching or going to Wall Street? I told him I wasn't sure. I was equally split on what direction to take. In coaching, you are directing people to achieve. You are trying to analyze where they are and help them get better. It's like that in money management, where you help individuals with their portfolio and help them make good investments. [Read: Use Football-Style Retirement Planning] What was the deciding factor in choosing to pursue finance? When I left Yale, I knew that when I stopped playing football, I would need something to do that I was passionate about and would enjoy. For me, that's always been based in economics and business and entrepreneurship. Before I was injured, I had already started looking into business ventures and looking at stock brokerages. I had my hand in the stock market, so it was a [logical] switch. Did the NFL prepare you for the fierce competition on Wall Street? As an individual, I would say yes. There's an acronym a lot of NFL players use for the league: not for long. There's always somebody working as hard as you, and they're always training someone to be your replacement. I think Wall Street is that way – if you don't perform, clients replace you. Did you gain financial knowledge on the football field? As a football player, you have to be consumed with playing the game. You need to prepare and put yourself in the best position to keep playing. Intense focus and going through sequential steps to succeed is applicable to a lot of areas, so it was easy for me to apply it to working in finance. Who was the most influential person in your financial career? The answer may seem odd, but I think that person was me. I really didn't know how difficult this business is. I went out on my own and focused on growing my own firm – managing the money the way I saw fit. I didn't try to emulate a lot of other people. I think not knowing how this business works allowed me time to pay for my own mistakes. I wasn't making money starting out, but I had money from [my football career] to support my business. [Read: Is an Online Financial Adviser Right for You?] The fact that I grew up without a lot of money allowed me to be comfortable not making a lot in the beginning. When I started my company, that was a period of time when I could have been making a lot more doing work for someone else, but I was focused on doing it my way and stayed with it long enough to convince more people to allow Profit Investments to manage their portfolio. Are some of your old NFL teammates clients? No, the majority of our business is in corporate pension funds. Early on, we managed money for athletes, but I shied away from it because I just wanted to manage the portfolio; I didn't want to get pulled more into representation or into managing careers for athletes. Who is your ideal client? An investor who is looking for a modest rate of return – at a reasonable degree of risk – over a market cycle, so around a three- to five-year time period. We want investors to stick to their investment objective – not jump around, trying to get a point here and a point there based on the headline of the day. I can't tell you what's going to happen today or tomorrow, but I can tell you what we've been able to achieve in a market cycle. [See: 50 Smart Money Moves] What's your investing philosophy? I am a valuation-sensitive growth investor who seeks to provide investors with reasonable returns at reduced risk, versus an index of securities. We try to build a margin of safety into portfolios for unknown events by buying strong companies that have stumbled for a temporary reason. What do people need to know about investing in today's market? As is always the case, there is no guarantee that investing in today's market will provide a positive return today, this week or this year. Successful investing is most likely achieved with a longer-term perspective and with good advisers helping guide you through volatile markets.
YouTubeEx-NYU professor Heleen Mees was arrested Monday night for allegedly stalking and harassing Willem Buiter, her ex-lover and Citigroup's economist.  Apparently their relationship goes back some time. Mees' doctoral thesis in economics at the Erasmus School of Economics, available online, is dedicated to Buiter. The version hosted on the website of the Wagner school, her former employer, has a full page inscribed "For Willem," along with the famous quote, "may you live in interesting times."   In the preface, Mees writes "Finally, I want to thank Willem Buiter who was so kind to meet with me in the summer of 2008 in London to discuss possible avenues for a doctoral thesis. Our meeting proved to be the first tangible step towards this thesis." The thesis, defended in August 2012, is titled "Changing Fortunes: How China's Boom Caused the Financial Crisis." It argues that "the build-up of savings in China and oil-exporting nations, which were heavily skewed towards fixed income assets, depressed interest rates worldwide from 2004 on," and that this, as much or more than anything Wall Street did, helped create the housing boom and financial crisis.  He's also thanked in the acknowledgments "for his thoughtful comments and continued encouragement." The thesis in full can be found here. Here's a screenshot of the dedication page: NYU Wagner And the preface (the reference to Buiter is at the end): NYU Wagner

Yesterday afternoon, the Treasury Department issued a statement saying that the White House would delay until 2015 the enforcement of the requirement for business to provide workers with health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, aka "Obamacare." Under the ACA, businesses employing 50 or more workers would have to offer health insurance or pay a penalty of $2,000 per worker. Jeff Saut, the top strategist at Raymond James, immediately blasted an email that read: "This is a big deal. A major 2H risk off the table..." However, UBS's Drew Matus isn't convinced that it's completely positive. First, here's the good news: The Administration announcement of a one-year delay in the employer mandate component of the Affordable Care Act, or â€œObamacareâ€, could help boost payroll growth. Although the delay is only temporary, for those employers on the cusp of the 50 employee threshold this delay may prompt them to hire as they may be unwilling to continue to postpone hiring to avoid being subject to the mandate. Additionally, employers may delay plans to cut back employee hours to keep them from being classified as â€œfull timeâ€ (the law considers employees who work 30 hours per week full-time). But: Although we see the most likely scenario being that the delay will have a mild positive effect on payrolls over the next few months, the risk exists that another change in regulations only adds to the uncertainty facing businesses. Increased uncertainty could create an even greater sense of caution among hiring managers and may crimp hiring at the margin, on net. In other words, companies got a delay in cost increases in exchange for longer-term uncertainty.

Knight Capital's Chairman/CEO Tom Joyce sent an email out this morning saying that he has resigned. Here's the email obtained by Business Insider: To the KCG Board of Directors: Over the course of the last eleven years, I have been fortunate to be the CEO of Knight Capital Group. Together we achieved a wide variety of the business goals we had established. With the transaction with GETCO completed, and after careful consideration, I have decided that now is the right time for me to resign as Executive Chairman and leave the organization.  As you know, it was my recommendation to the Board that Knight remain independent. That said, I remain confident that, once the issue of independence was taken off the table, the merger with GETCO was the best alternative available to Knight shareholders and other key stakeholders – including clients and employees. I take great pride in the fact that “legacy Knight” is operating so well as it moves into KCG Holdings. And I am gratified that the values at the core of Knight’s DNA – client service, integrity and maintaining the highest standard of business ethics – will continue to be core values of KCG going forward. Our business success is dependent upon relationships built on trust, and it is due to the committed and hardworking employees of Knight that our company has been successful through the years.   Similarly, it has been an honor to work closely with Knight’s clients.  They have been remarkably loyal to the firm and have been rewarded with consistently outstanding market making, institutional sales and trading, and electronic execution services. I wish my fellow directors and KCG’s employees every success as they move forward. All the best, Tom Joyce Fox Business News' senior correspondent Charlie Gasparino is also reporting this on Twitter and that Joyce sent the email to his friends, too. Knight Capital's merger with Getco was just completed a couple days ago. Last summer, Knight Capital lost $400 million due to a trading glitch in one of its programs.
With the Federal Reserve on a multi-year mission to keep interest rates as low as possible, investors seeking yield moved out on the risk spectrum from investment grade bonds to things like high-yield (or junk) bonds. This shift made junk bonds pricier, forcing the risk-reward ratio to become unattractive. However, with interest rates surging and bonds all over the world selling off in recent weeks, the opportunity to buy junk bonds might be now. "High yield has been a popular trade for several years given the economic recovery and low default rate," write the analysts at BlackRock. "With the recent shift in interest rates and the economy still growing, the sector is attractive. Can investors continue to reap returns? We believe so." Here's their chart: BlackRock Bond god Jeffrey Gundlach made a similar argument last week. "The liquidation cycle appears to have run its course," said Gundlach pointing to junk bonds among other things. Here's a slide from Gundlach's presentation showing how junk bond market may have inflected from its bottom. DoubleLine Funds
Back in April, it was announced that Sir Winston Churchill would likely replace Elizabeth Fry on £5 notes from 2016. Fry had been on the notes since 2001, and the decision to replace her with Winston Churchill came from former Bank of England governor Mervyn King. If this were to be approved, there would be no women on any denomination of British bank notes. The Queen appears on all the notes but this argument is often considered moot because she is the constitutional monarch, and was 'born into her position'. After taking the tube to the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street on his first day, Mark Carney received a letter from Mary Macleod, MP saying: "The symbolism of having no women on our bank notes leaves a chasm where there once was inspiration - and contributes to an undoing of some of the hard work I know this Government has done to remove barriers and support women in our country." On his third day at office, Carney sent out this response: (h/t John Ethan Detrixhe) Bank of England
">Daniel Goodman / Business InsiderThe June reading of the ISM non-manufacturing (aka services) index is out and it's a miss. The headline number fell to 52.2 in June from 53.7 in May. Economists were looking for a reading of 54.0. Here's a look at the sub-indices: From the report: "The NMIâ„¢ registered 52.2 percent in June, 1.5 percentage points lower than the 53.7 percent registered in May. This indicates continued growth at a slightly slower rate in the non-manufacturing sector. The Non-Manufacturing Business Activity Index registered 51.7 percent, which is 4.8 percentage points lower than the 56.5 percent reported in May, reflecting growth for the 47th consecutive month. The New Orders Index decreased by 5.2 percentage points to 50.8 percent, and the Employment Index increased 4.6 percentage points to 54.7 percent, indicating growth in employment for the 11th consecutive month. The Prices Index increased 1.4 percentage points to 52.5 percent, indicating prices increased at a faster rate in June when compared to May. According to the NMIâ„¢, 14 non-manufacturing industries reported growth in June. Respondents' comments are mixed about business conditions depending upon the industry and company. The majority indicate that growth has been slow and incremental; however, it is still better year over year." ISM Click Here For Updates Â»
Erix/ FlickrA blog post by Michael Schmidt published on June 8 on Investopedia represents pretty much everything that is wrong with financial journalism. The post is titled: â€œChoose A Fund With A Winning Managerâ€. The author assumes trying to pick an outperforming fund manager is a worthy endeavor. His premise is fatally flawed, as illustrated by the â€œguidanceâ€ he sets forth for accomplishing this elusive goal. Once you buy into the concept of finding a fund manager who can â€œbeat the markets,â€ you are already on the road to financial perdition. Letâ€™s put the task of trying to pick a â€œwinning fund managerâ€ in perspective. In a study by investment management firm First Quadrant, the authors found the average actively managed fund underperformed its benchmark by a whopping 4.17 percent after taxes over the 10-year period studied. Only 9 percent of the funds studied over the period outperformed their benchmark after taxes. The benchmark was the Vanguard 500 Index Fund. Assuming you were somehow successful in identifying the small pool of â€œwinners,â€ how big is your payoff? The same study found the winners â€œwonâ€ by an average of only 1.79 percent. Itâ€™s far more likely you would have picked a â€œloser,â€ in which case your returns would have suffered a big hit. The many â€œlosersâ€ lost by an average of 4.79 percent. If you are an investor and not a speculator, presumably you are concerned with the overall performance of your portfolio, and not just the returns of a particular fund. For you, the relevant inquiry is how likely it is your portfolio of actively managed funds will outperform a portfolio of comparable index funds. We donâ€™t have to guess at the odds. My colleague Larry Swedroe noted in aÂ blog postÂ that the odds of a portfolio of 10 equally weighted actively managed funds, rebalanced annually, successfully generating outperformance (or â€œalphaâ€) over a 10-year period is a minuscule 0.055 percent. When you consider taxes and longer time periods, the odds are even lower. If these overwhelming odds donâ€™t discourage you, you will find little comfort in the suggestions offered by Schmidt for finding the â€œwinnersâ€ needle in the â€œlosersâ€ haystack. He advises looking at the qualifications of the fund manager, examining the fund for consistency, definability, soundness, relative versus absolute performance, peer performance, performance over cycles and personal investment. Absent from these broad and vague terms are any metrics that would permit you to screen for these traits, assuming you have the tools that would permit you to do so. Without finite metrics, these observations are simply blather. They provide no assistance to anyone engaged in the ill-advised quest for alpha. Notably missing from Schmidtâ€™s musings is reference to a study (or to any other data) illustrating how someone using his methodology was able to identify â€œwinningâ€ fund managers prospectively. There is a reason why those who write about pickingÂ â€œwinningâ€ mutual fundsÂ are long on rhetoric and short on data. There is no credible evidence anyone has the ability to engage in this exercise successfully. Hereâ€™s the bottom line: The game of trying to pick outperforming fund managers is not worthy of your time or effort. You are unlikely to succeed. Instead, you should focus on your asset allocation, invest in a globally diversified portfolio of low management fee index funds and focus on factors you can control, such as diversification, fees, costs and taxes. Schmidt could provide more value to investors by showing them how tocapture market returns, rather than holding out the false hope of â€œbeating the markets.â€ Dan SolinÂ is the director of investor advocacy for theÂ BAM AllianceÂ and a wealth adviser withÂ Buckingham Asset Management.

REUTERS/Jason Alden/poolAfter a double-dip recession and a modest recovery in the second quarter, the UK economy is in need of some fresh ideas. Enter Mark Carney. The former Bank of Canada governor, took the reins from Mervyn King on July 1. Carney is charming, with many likening him to George Clooney and Cary Grant. And celebrated â€” he is often called theÂ rock star central banker. And then there is his erudite background. He has a bachelor's degree in economics from Harvard, an MPhil in economics from Oxford, and a PHD in economics from Nuffield College, Oxford. He then spent 13 years at Goldman Sachs before transitioning to the public sector. As governor of the Bank of Canada he was considered to have the Midas touch. He was credited with steeringÂ  Canada away from the worst of the financial crisis and helping put it back on the path to recovery much faster than other developed economies. So, it's understandable that he managed to negotiate a Â£874,000 package to move to London, according to The Guardian, including a monthly Â£10,000 housing allowance. He will also only be serving a five-year term, instead of the usual eight. Forward guidance:Â  First order of the day The pressure is on for Carney, as an outsider, to bring with him a change in "the culture of an institution that has been dominated by a single personality for the past 20 years," according to UBS' Amit Kara. He is expected to introduce forward guidance, similar to the Fed i.e. signal monetary policy stance ahead of time. But Kara argues that forward guidance is likely to be less effective in the UK because of "the unpredictability of the UK economy." The Bank of England on the other hand has managed to get its forecasts wrong. From Kara: "Mr Carney will most likely announce a framework for guidance in August along with publication of the Inflation Report. The framework will be necessarily cautious and, as such, include a heavy dose of conditionality to satisfy other MPC members that are similarly skeptical about the benefits of forward guidance. "We have also contended that Mr Carney will bring about a welcome change in the culture of the institution. In this context, though, it is important to remind ourselves that the BoE has been one of the most aggressive and innovative central banks in recent years, and that is one aspect (along with the traditional pink coats of the doormen) that the new governor will be keen to preserve." But others argue that forward guidance could help ease some of the volatility and spill over from rising rates in the U.S. How different will Carney be from his predecessor, Mervyn King? First, in his testimony to the Treasury Select Committee (TSC) in February, Carney said central banks should consider nominal gross domestic product (NGDP) targeting if QE measures aren't enough, since this would allow for a more aggressive response. Carney did however say that inflation targeting was preferred overÂ  NGDP targeting. In this regard he is quite like King, because he believes there is "considerable flexibility in the current inflation targeting framework and a very high bar for switching from it," according to a February note by Jamie Dannhauser at Lombard Street Research. Second, both Carney and King justify extending the time frame for inflation to be brought back to target, though Carney is more likely to have a time frame. Third, like King, Carney is expected to vote for more gilt purchases. Remember King was looking for an additional Â£25 billion in gilt purchases but had six members of the MPC vote against it. Dannhauser thinks the MPC under Carney will vote for more gilt purchases in 2013-2014, but that they would not take center stage in the committee's tool box. Fourth, unlike King, Carney is in favor "of using monetary policy to â€˜lean against the windâ€™ of asset bubbles," wrote Dannhauser. He thinks it is important to use interest rates to ensure financial stability.Â  "In all likelihood, the differences between Bank of England policy under Carney and that under Mervyn King will be more apparent than real... "Carney himself questions the magnitude of QEâ€™s benefit on the real economy, and while acknowledging that the marginal benefit is likely to be positive, notes that there are potential costs from long- lasting monetary stimulus. Like Mervyn King, Mark Carney does not appear persuaded by some of the more radical monetary ideas that could be considered, e.g. money-financed fiscal policy, or notably a change of fiscal course. Both are also persuaded of the need for swift and radical reform of the banking system, and at the same time complacent about the short-term damage to output growth and the increasing pro-cyclicality of bank regulation. "All in all, we do not believe that much of substance is going to change. Monetary policy will continue along the same path, i.e. aggressive stimulus and an extended time frame over which inflation is brought back to target." Remember, Carney was hand-picked by Mervyn King. So, in the near term, the biggest difference we see might just be the changes he brings to culture and hierarchy at the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street. Not everyone's a fan Some have raised questions about his time at Goldman Sachs and his decision to appoint another investment banker, Banco Santander's Charlotte Hogg, to be the BoE's first chief operating officer. "That resumeÃ© rundown isn't meant to impute personal venality to any of these officials; it's to point out the corruption of a system governed by unelected ex-bankers colluding in unprecedented austerity for the poor, while shoveling hundreds of billions at bankers ," wrote Aditya Chakraborty in The Guardian.  REUTERS/Marc Serota MSSociete Generale's Albert Edwards said Carney's stance on NGDP targeting was cause for concern because it showed the willingness of "policymakers to become more and more interventionist in their monetary experiments." He even compared Carney to Alan Greenspan: "In 2005 I described Alan Greenspan as an economic war criminal when most others had decided he was â€œthe greatest central banker who ever livedâ€, Hence I note with alarm that some commentators are so excited about the appointment of Mark Carney to the Bank of England Governorship that now he Carney, is now being dubbed â€œthe worldâ€™s greatest central bankerâ€. Oh dear! From everything I have read so far I fear that in the fullness of time he will have more similarities with Alan Greenspan than just this unwanted accolade and his legacy will be equally destructive." Of course the course isn't easy for Carney at the Bank of England. Dissent from the other members of the monetary policy committee could dampen his agenda, as could the constraints of fiscal policy. Carney will preside over his first meeting as the governor of the Bank of England this week. He isn't expected to announce additional gilt purchases at his first meeting.
AP ImagesEver since the financial crisis in 2008, the Federal Reserve has employed extremely loose monetary policy in its effort to stimulate the economy in the right direction. This included keeping short-term interest rates near zero and keeping long-term interest rates low through bond purchases. Some warned that this would lead to rampant inflation.Â  But inflation has stayed extremely low. One of the reasons for this is because the velocity of money has been low.Â  In other words, all of the additional money in the system hasn't changed hands as frequently as some would've expected. Art Cashin, the veteran trader from UBS, discusses this in his note this morning.Â  Specifically, he talks about how he and his "friends of fermentation" were in a "frenzy" over it. From Cashin: Failure To Achieve Escape Velocity â€“ The FoF Trading Division (Local 410) was in a bit of a frenzy yesterday as they circulated a chart from the St. Louis Fed showing that monetary velocity continued to fall and had slipped to a level lower than at the depths of the recession in 2009.Â  I have been greatly concerned about this lack of velocity for years.Â  Here's what I wrote back in 2010: Pushing On A String â€“ The Fedâ€™s Frustration â€“ Chairman Bernanke may not be sleeping well.Â  In 2002, he famously said that to stave off inflation, the Fed could even drop tons of money from helicopters.Â  That was hyperbole, of course, but the Fedâ€™s version of the helicopter plan has not been working out very well.Â  Itâ€™s as though they dropped the money on the lawn and the homeowner raked it up and put it all in a garage â€“ and then went back to bed. The Fed has tripled its balance sheet.Â  Banks are sitting on nearly a trillion dollars of excess reserves.Â  Corporations are sitting on over a trillion dollars in cash.Â  Yet, the monetary base has remained stagnant for months.Â  The broad money supply (M3) has actually fallen significantly this year. Money has no velocity today.Â  The money supply can only grow if you spend it or lend it.Â  Instead, it sits idle in that garage. Here's what that chart looks like via the St. Louis Fed: St. Louis Fed Cashin also references the comments of Barry Ritholtz of the Big Picture: Recently, my friend, Barry Ritholtz, did an extensive and enlightening review of those stagnant free reserves in his terrific blog â€“ The Big Picture.Â  Here is a bit from the opening: Robert D. Auerbach â€“ an economist with the U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee for eleven years, assisting with oversight of the Federal Reserve, and now Professor of Public Affairs at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin â€“ notes [1] today: There is a massive misconception about where the Bernanke Fedâ€™s stimulus landed. Although the Bernanke Fed has disbursed $2.284 trillion in new money (the monetary base) since August 1, 2008, one month before the 2008 financial crisis, 81.5 percent now sits idle as excess reserves in private banks. The banks are not required to hold excess reserves. The excess reserves exploded from $831 billion in August 2008 to $1.863 trillion on June 14, 2013. The excess reserves of the nationâ€™s private banks had previously stayed at nearly zero since 1959 as seen on the St. Louis Fedâ€™s chart [2]. The banks did not leave money idle in excess reserves at zero interest because they were investing in income earning assets, including loans to consumers and businesses. This 81.5 percent explosion in idle excess reserves means that the Bernanke Fedâ€™s new money issues of $85 billion each month have never been a big stimulus. Approximately 81.5 percent (or $69.27 billion) is either bought by banks or deposited into banks where it sits idle as excess reserves. The rest of the $85 billion, approximately 18.5 percent (or $15.72 billion) continues to circulate or is held as required reserves on banksâ€™ deposit accounts (unlike unrequired excess reserves). Wow!Â  81% of all the QE is sitting in a vault as stagnant as if it were in that proverbial garage.Â  (It's a terrific review and if you can access it, read it thoroughly over the holiday or on the weekend.) Sort of puts "tapering" in a slightly different perspective doesn't.Â  Velocity is essential in a fractional banking system. Interesting how things work.
Wikimedia Commons/ Cynthia van ElkA former NYU economics professor was arrested on Monday night for allegedly stalking and harassing her ex-lover, Citigroup's chief economist Willem Buiter, the New York Daily News' Shayna Jacobs and Rich Schapiro report. According to the NYDN, the econ professor allegedly sent Buiter racy pictures and thousands of messages, some of which are x-rated, over the last two years. Here are the details from NYDN:  Heleen Mees, 44, was busted for stalking and harassing chief Citigroup economist Willem Buiter — sending him photos of herself masturbating and images of other naked women, the Daily News has learned. A one-time NYU professor, Mees sent Buiter more than 1,000 emails over a two-year period, authorities said. Some of them were laced with threats, while at least one was a hyper-sexual come-on. “What can I do to make it right? Shall I lick your b---s?” Mees allegedly wrote in one email. Buiter — who coined the term "Grexit" and is renowned for his work on sovereign debt — is married to Anne Sibert, who is also an economist.  They have two children together. According to the report, Mees was allegedly sending Sibert and the kids messages, too.   A lawyer for Mees told the paper that the emails between her client and Buiter "go in both directions."

REUTERS/Shannon StapletonAmid concerns of a Fed taper, investors pulled a record $23.3 billion from bond funds in the week ending June 26. Bank of America's Michael Hartnett dubbed it a 'bond market liquidation' in a note to clients. But Joe Davis, chief economist at Vanguard, still owns Treasuries. Back in March 2012, when investors were reallocating their bond portfolios, Davis wrote that he was sticking to his overall bond allocation, including Treasury bonds. In a new webcast, Davis reiterates the arguments made in that piece. He says there are three key reasons to hold on to Treasuries:  "...It was, one was just because interest rates are low does not mean that they have to rise tomorrow and, again, that was more than two years ago and so itâ€™s taken some time for rates to rise, and whoâ€™s to say if theyâ€™re going to rise immediately the next two days, either?Â  "Secondly is that with low interest rates, that did imply muted return for bond portfolios over the next several years, and that there was more risk of a one-year or one-month loss going forward than there had been over the past 30 or 40 years just because the low-income cushions in those portfolios, and that has played out at least in the past day or two, and then, finally, most importantly, and why I still own U.S. Treasury bonds as part of a broadly diversified portfolio, is that bonds are just inherently, as a broad asset class, less volatile than equities, and that played out yesterday. Equities were down more than fixed income even though rising rates was the source of the concern, and so thatâ€™s just the broad tenet. "I think for all of us, we just have to know and realize why we own fixed income securities in a portfolio, and the one thing that I would say that would be different is that rates today are slightly higher than they were at that post. And so, if anything, that would imply a slightly higher expected return going forward for bonds than at the time we did that." Davis believes that investors need to have "explicit Treasury exposure" to have a balanced portfolio.Â

U.S. futures are rebounding in the wake of two good jobs reports. At 8:15, ADP told us the private U.S. companies added 188,000 payrolls in June.Â  This was better than the 160,000 expected. At 8:30, we learned that initial weekly jobless claims fell to 343,000 from 348,000 a week ago. Economists were looking for a reading of 345,000. Dow futures are down 37 points and S&amp;P futures are down 4.5 points. Before the reports, Dow futures were down 72 points and S&amp;P futures were down 8.5 points. Treasuries are selling off.

Fifty thousand dollars is a game-changer, wouldn't you agree? For the second year, the Value Investing Congress (VIC), a massive investment idea conference, and SumZero, an online community of investment professionals, are sponsoring the Value Investing Challenge â€” a chance for young investors to share their best idea with a panel of professionals and see how it measures up. This year things are little different than last year, though. The first prize winner doesn't just get to speak to the VIC alongside big names like David Einhorn and Bill Ackman (they spoke last year), they also get $50,000 cash, 1 free year's subscription to FactSet (the sponsor of the Challenge), and free attendance at the VIC's investing workshop. The 2nd place winner gets all that, but a $10,000 cash prize, and the third place winner gets all that but a $5,000 prize. Obviously this is serious stuff â€” the only catch is that you have to be a member of the SumZero community and be currently working at an investment firm (they want these ideas to be actionable). Other than that, anyone's free to enter the contest starting July 15th (get more details here). The New York Value Investing Congress is scheduled for September 16th and 17th. "What we're trying to do here is reduce the barriers to entry associated with AUM and firm pedigree and open up a grand channel for great thinkers no matter where they work," said Nicholas Kapur, Senior Vice President of SumZero. "It's about research." Win or lose all contestants will get their work evaluated by some of the brightest minds in the game. Check out the list of judges: And just as a reminder, last year's winner was Ryan Fusaro, a young analyst at LionEye Capital. Since winning based on his long call on Jack in the Box he's been named one of Forbes' 30 under 30. As for his call, Jack in the Box is up 48% since Fusaro spoke last October. So if you're going to win, you better come correct.

The miss without regard to sign has averaged 42K in the eight months since the change, down from 53K in the previous eight months."

AP, Verge Images, Photoshop by Jay YarowThere has been an endless wait for the much-ballyhooed Apple television set. Last year, one of the reasons Apple stock charged above $700 was the conviction of many analysts that Apple would soon launch a magical new TV set that would turbocharge sales and revolutionize the TV industry. Well, the TV never arrived. Instead, we got news stories about how Apple had been trying--and failing--to strike content deals with TV networks and cable companies. But now there's cause for hope again! If not for a television set in particular, at least for further progress in Apple's TV efforts. Bloomberg's Adam SatarianoÂ andÂ Alex Sherman report that Apple is close to signing a deal with Time Warner Cable to allow Time Warner Cable subscribers to watch Time Warner Cable channels over Apple TV. The companies are planning to announce the deal within a few months, Bloomberg reports. The deal would allow the ~12 million owners of Apple TV boxes to stream Time Warner channels. It would not, yet, involve (or require) the launch of an Apple television set. A deal like this would be a change in strategy from the one that some analysts expected Apple to pursue--namely, one in which Apple would sell TV programming directly to consumers, bypassing cable and other pay-TV providers in the process. This deal would mean that Apple is now working within the current pay-TV structure, which is the route many "over-the-top" TV content providers are going. A deal like this would also mean that Apple would not really be "revolutionizing" the TV industry so much as continuing to change it incrementally. Nevertheless! If Time Warner Cable subscribers can watch most (or all) Time Warner Cable channels via Apple TV, Apple's little television add-on, this would radically increase the value of Apple TV to these households. And, more importantly, this would be the first step in unifying what, in many households, has now become an annoying hodge-podge of TV interfaces--Apple TV or another Internet-powered set-top box for Netflix, Hulu, and on-demand movies and programs, and normal cable TV for sports and live television. If Apple can begin to make Apple TV (or an Apple television set) the primary interface for television, Apple will begin to amass a very powerful position in the TV industry. With a proliferation of thousands upon thousands of TV content choices available on-demand at any time, the power of the owner of the gateway to the content increases. The power of the particular "pipe" or "network" that packages it, meanwhile, decreases. ' Eventually, if Apple can place itself between enough consumers and enough television programming, Apple will likely be able to begin "go direct" to some television content producers, cutting out some of the current aggregators (networks and cable companies) in the process. In other words, although a deal like this would be a small step relative to the "revolution" that some were expecting Apple to deliver in the TV arena, it would still be an important step. And it would be one that could eventually lead to Apple amassing a considerably stronger position in the TV industry. Disclosure: A few months ago, when Apple stock fell to $390,Â I bought some.Â I think stock-picking is an idiotic strategy for individual investors, and I invest almost entirely in low-cost, tax efficient index funds. But, sometimes, I just have to put my money where my mouth is. If Apple really is becoming Nokia, as many on Wall Street now expect, the stock could drop to $250. If Apple merely does okay over the next several years, however, the stock should do okay. And in the meantime, it will pay a nice, fat dividend..

APNEW YORK (Reuters) - Michael Dell has been advised to raise his $24.4 billion offer for Dell Inc, coming under further pressure as billionaire investor Carl Icahn revealed he had committed more than $3 billion to back an alternative proposal. The PC maker's special committee told Dell's founder and chief executive a few days ago that he should raise his offer if he wants it to succeed, a person familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. The special committee, which was formed to independently assess what the best option for Dell shareholders is, came to that conclusion based on its meetings with investors as well as concerns over a key upcoming recommendation by investment advisory firm ISS, the person said. ISS is expected to publish its view on whether Michael Dell's offer, which is backed by equity financing from buyout firm Silver Lake, is in the interest of Dell's shareholders as early as next week. A July 18 shareholder vote on Dell's take-private plan will follow. Despite being advised by the special committee that he should raise his offer to see the transaction through, Michael Dell was non-committal, the person added, confirming an earlier report by Bloomberg News. Dell Inc and Silver Lake declined to comment. The special committee's move came as Icahn and his affiliates disclosed on Tuesday they had provided $3.42 billion, or 66 percent, of the debt financing to back his bid for Dell. Investment bank Jefferies &amp; Co provided $1.6 billion, or 30 percent of the overall $5.2 billion in committed financing with the remainder of about $179 million coming from 14 institutional funds, including pension funds and insurance companies, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing. "The fact that he could not get lending from other banks suggests they are not too friendly to this," said Steven Kaplan, a University of Chicago finance professor. "However, one must note that a few banks are locked up with the Silver Lake offer." "On the positive side, Icahn is putting a lot of money where his mouth is," Kaplan added. Other market participants evaluating the transaction said Icahn's move could indicate he may never have aimed to broadly distribute the deal in the first place. Calls to Carl Icahn, who runs Icahn Enterprises LP, were not immediately returned. Icahn and Southeastern Asset Management are preparing an offer that would see shareholders tender 1.1 billion shares at $14 apiece, rivaling Michael Dell's and Silver Lake's $24.4 billion buyout offer of $13.65 a share. The billionaire investor has said Michael Dell's offer substantially undervalues the company. Dell's special board committee had recommended Michael Dell's offer to shareholders. While the financing commitment marks a crucial step forward for Icahn's bid for Dell, it is contingent on a dozen board appointments, according to the SEC filing. Unless all 12 of the nominees proposed by Icahn and Southeastern on May 13 are elected to Dell's board, the financing is unlikely to take place. Icahn's proposal will also be put to shareholders only if the offer by Michael Dell and Silver Lake is not accepted by shareholders when they meet on July 18. All eyes are now on ISS. If it moves against Michael Dell's offer, he will be under even more pressure to raise it. "It's a game of chicken," a shareholder said. "Icahn's going for the bump." Speculation about a possible bump in the offer price began on Tuesday with a CNBC report that cited sources claiming that Michael Dell's camp was not feeling confident that ISS will recommend his offer. An ISS spokeswoman, however, said that ISS was still working on its analysis and never signals its recommendation in advance. Another person familiar with the matter reiterated on Tuesday that neither Michael Dell nor Silver Lake have made any decision on whether to increase their offer. All sources spoke on condition of anonymity because the matter is confidential. The $5.2 billion financing deal put together by Icahn was shown to a mix of U.S. and foreign banks, asset managers, hedge funds and collateralized loan obligation (CLO) managers. Icahn's proposed tender offer will be financed with $7.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet, the $5.2 billion credit facility and $2.9 billion from the sale of receivables. If Icahn's proposal prevails, the loans would launch to a more broad range of institutional investors before September 30, or the three-month commitment period of the $5.2 billion loans, according to sources.

Thanks, perhaps, to tensions in Egypt, oil has had quite a 24 hours, with some particularly ferocious buying late yesterday evening. From FinViz: FinViz
The news today is that the Euro crisis has returned to the Eurozone. Portugal is crashing to the tune of 6% on the resignation of the Finance Minister, who says he can no longer support such harsh austerity. Other markets are getting clubbed in the fallout. Spain is off nearly 3%. Italy nearly 2%. The reality of Europe is that it's a gigantic economic and political mess, where unemployment in the common currency area has hit a record of 12.1%. On the other hand, it's not like there aren't signs of life in the economy, which appears to be coming out of recession. Monday's manufacturing PMI figures showed broad improvement across the Eurozone. Markit But although these numbers are encouraging from a cyclical standpoint, these tiny greenshoots barely begin to make a dent in the gigantic economic problem, which will likely cause reverberations for whole generations. Europe needs substantial economic recovery, fast. Otherwise the forces of politics will create more situations like that in Portugal, and the will to keep it all together will dissolve.
There are increasing signs that the UK is coming back. The latest: A very strong reading on the services PMI front. For June the index shot to a 27-month high, hitting 56.9 from 54.7 last month. This chart shows the nice spike. Markit The timing of the rebound is perfect for Mark Carney, the new Bank of England governor, who has his first policy meeting tomorrow.
">Daniel Goodman / Business InsiderIt's the day before the July 4 holiday, and US markets will be closed early. But sorry, it's going to be a very busy day. First of all, you have the mess in Europe, particularly Portugal, where the market is plunging thanks to the resignation of the finance minister. Then of course, there's all of the Egypt stuff to pay attention to. And on top of that, there's just a lot happening econ-wise. From SocGen's Kit Juckes:  The US has a very busy data calendar today, and an early pre-4 July close. Yesterday's car sales data showed annualized sales get back to their best levels since 2007, yet another sign of the slow rehabilitation of the US economy. SG forecasts a rise in US non-manufacturing ISM to 54.5, a ‘taper-consistent' outcome that would contrast sharply with the Eurozone's 48.6. We get mortgage applications, ADP, trade data and weekly claims, too but short Treasuries vs. Bunds/Gilts and long USD vs. pretty much any other currency I can think of, still seems the way forwards. Enjoy.
REUTERS/Mohamed Abd El Ghany CAIRO (AP) — With a military deadline for a resolution to Egypt's political crisis looming, the country braced for a showdown Wednesday after embattled President Mohammed Morsi insisted he will not step down in the face of demands by millions of protesters, vowing to protect his "constitutional legitimacy" with his life. On the streets, the sense that both sides are ready to fight to the end sharpened, with overnight clashes between supporters of the Islamist president and opponents that left at least 23 dead, most of them in a single incident of fighting outside Cairo University. The violence came just hours before a deadline set by the military was to expire Wednesday for Morsi to find a solution with the opposition or the army would impose its own political plan. The draft would see the military suspend the constitution, disband parliament and install a new leadership. With his political fate hanging in the balance, Morsi demanded in a speech late Tuesday that the powerful armed forces withdraw their ultimatum, saying he rejected all "dictates" — from home or abroad. In an emotional address aired live to the nation, the Islamist leader who a year ago was inaugurated as Egypt's first freely elected president accused loyalists of his ousted autocratic predecessor Hosni Mubarak of exploiting the wave of protests to topple his regime and thwart democracy. "There is no substitute for legitimacy," said Morsi, at times angrily raising his voice, thrusting his fist in the air and pounding the podium. He warned that electoral and constitutional legitimacy "is the only guarantee against violence." The statement showed that Morsi and his Muslim Brotherhood are prepared to run the risk of challenging the army. It also entrenches the lines of confrontation between his Islamist supporters and Egyptians angry over what they see as his efforts to impose control through the Brotherhood and his failures to deal with the country's multiple problems. As anti- and pro-Morsi supporters geared up for the fourth consecutive day of mass rallies Wednesday, it was clear that Egypt's crisis has become a struggle over whether a popular uprising can overturn the verdict of the ballot box. Morsi's opponents say he has lost his legitimacy through mistakes and power grabs and that their turnout on the streets over the past three days shows the nation has turned against him. On Tuesday, millions of jubilant, chanting Morsi opponents again filled Cairo's historic Tahrir Square, as well as avenues adjacent to two presidential palaces in the capital, and main squares in cities nationwide. After Morsi's speech, they erupted in indignation, banging metal fences to raise a din, some raising their shoes in the air in a show of contempt. "Leave, leave," they chanted. The president's supporters also moved out in increased marches in Cairo and other cities, and stepped up warnings that it will take bloodshed to dislodge him. While Morsi has stuck to a stance that he is defending democracy in Egypt, many of his Islamist backers have presented the fight as one to protect Islam. Political violence was more widespread on Tuesday, with multiple clashes between the two camps in Cairo as well as in the Mediterranean city of Alexandria and other cities. A march by Morsi supporters outside Cairo University came under fire from gunmen on nearby rooftops. At least 23 people were killed in Cairo and more than 200 injured, according to hospital and security officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media. Most of the killings took place outside Cairo University in Cairo's twin city of Giza. The latest deaths take to at least 39 the people who have died since the first day of protests, Sunday. On Monday, the military gave Morsi an ultimatum to meet the protesters' demands within 48 hours. If not, the generals' plan would suspend the Islamist-backed constitution, dissolve the Islamist-dominated legislature and set up an interim administration headed by the country's chief justice, the state news agency reported. The leaking of the military's so-called political "road map" appeared aimed at adding pressure on Morsi by showing the public and the international community that the military has a plan that does not involve a coup. On his official Twitter account, Morsi urged the armed forces "to withdraw their ultimatum" and said he rejects any domestic or foreign dictates." In the 46-minute speech Tuesday, he implicitly warned the military against removing him, saying such action will "backfire on its perpetrators." Fearing that Washington's most important Arab ally would descend into chaos, U.S. officials said they are urging Morsi to take immediate steps to address opposition grievances, telling the protesters to remain peaceful and reminding the army that a coup could have consequences for the massive American military aid package it receives. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Morsi's adviser Ayman Ali denied that the U.S. asked Egypt to call early presidential elections and said consultations were continuing to reach national conciliation and resolve the crisis. He did not elaborate. The army has insisted it has no intention to take power. But the reported road map showed it was ready to replace Morsi and make a sweeping change in the ramshackle political structure that has evolved since Mubarak's fall in February 2011. The constitution and domination of the legislature after elections held in late 2011-early 2012 are two of the Islamists' and Brotherhood's most valued victories — along with Morsi's election last year. At least one anti-Morsi TV station put up a clock counting down to the end of the military's ultimatum, putting it at 4 p.m. Wednesday (1400 GMT, 10 a.m. EDT), though a countdown clock posted online by Morsi opponents put the deadline at 5 p.m. (1500 GMT, 11 a.m. EDT). The military did not give a precise hour. Morsi also faced new fissures within his leadership. Three government spokesmen — two for Morsi and one for the prime minister — quit on Tuesday as part of high-level defections that underscored Morsi's increasing isolation and fallout from the military's ultimatum. Five Cabinet ministers, including the foreign minister, resigned Monday, and a sixth, Sports Minister El-Amry Farouq, also quit Tuesday. One ultraconservative Salafi party, al-Nour, also announced its backing for early elections. The party was once an ally of Morsi but in recent months has broken with him. In a significant move, opposition parties and the youth movement behind the demonstrations agreed that reform leader and Nobel Peace laureate Mohamed ElBaradei would represent them in any negotiations on the country's political future. The move appeared aimed at presenting a unified voice in a post-Morsi system, given the widespread criticism that the opposition has been too fragmented to present an alternative to the Islamists.

Wikimedia CommonsThe big news today is that Portugal is crashing. The resignation of the country's Finance Minister, due to his disinclination to continue pursuing austerity, is causing stocks to fall there by 6%. And that news is reverberating across the Eurozone. Spain's IBEX, the market of its closest neighbor, is down 2.7%. Greek stocks are down 1.8%. Italian stocks are down 2.1%. Germany is down 1.8%. You get the idea. This, as always, remains the biggest risk for Europe, that even if there's some slight improvement in the economy, that the real world would become so intolerably bad that the political will for the ongoing structure gives out. That's what's happening, it seems, in Portugal.
APAnd it's like the good old days in Europe today. The Portuguese stock markets is crashing over 6%. Interest rates on Portuguese bonds are spiking. The cause? The Finance Minister has resigned in a dispute over austerity. From WSJ: Mr. Gaspar said in his resignation letter that he had first offered to step down last October amid evidence that public and political support for the country's austerity program was fading. Protests and strikes have become more common since then, and some lawmakers from the governing coalition have joined its critics in saying austerity is doing the country more harm than good. "It is my conviction that my exit will contribute to reinforce your leadership and cohesion within the government," Mr. Gaspar wrote to Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho in the letter. Europe is red across the board. Germany is down 1.5%. Italy is off 1.8%. Spain is down 2.6%.
