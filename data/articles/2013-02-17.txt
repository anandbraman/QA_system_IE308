Leechimondo san / FlickrChina is back after its one-week Lunar New Year holiday, and stocks are up. China's Shanghai Composite is up around 0.4 percent to start the week. Japan's Nikkei, however, is up a solid 2.0 percent. G20 leaders, who have been meeting in Moscow, declared that there would be no global currency war.¬† However, there wasn't much mention of Japan, which the markets appear to be interpreting as a pass. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke's recent language has also been interpreted as a green light for Japan to devalue.
Robert Stinnett / FlickrLast week, Bloomberg reported that emails exchanged by Wal-Mart executives suggested that February sales so far were a "total disaster."¬† Blaming the recent payroll tax hike, among other things, at least one exec reportedly wrote that this was the "worst start to a month I have seen in my ~7 years with the company." A spokesperson for Walmart told Bloomberg that the emails "lack the proper context." Regardless, anything short of an outright denial could be a troubling sign for the U.S. consumer, Wal-Mart's business, and furthermore the businesses of Wal-Mart's suppliers. The International Securities Exchange offers an index that consists of 30 major suppliers that are heavily exposed to Wal-Mart. We pulled 18 big publicly-traded companies that get at least 20 percent of their revenue from Wal-Mart. These are the companies that are probably most worried about the content of those leaked emails. Eric Platt helped compile the research for this feature.
Last week, a Twitter handle named @Greenlightcap tweeted about Herbalife and the recent drama going on between finance behemoths Carl Icahn and Bill Ackman. However, this Twitter handle is not associated with Greenlight Capital, the hedge fund run by David Einhorn. Einhorn just sent out a tweet to clear this up: @davidein Einhorn tweets extremely infrequently.¬† Business Insider first learned about his Twitter handle last July when he was tweeting from the World Series Of Poker, where he was a competitor. Indeed, his last tweet was on July 5, when he suggested his next tweet wouldn't be until the next poker tourney.
Retail sales climbed by just 0.1 percent in January.† While this number may seem week, it was right in line with expectations.† And it was seen as confirmation that the initial impact of the recent payroll tax hike wasn't any worse than expected. Most economists argue that we'll have to wait a month or two before we really understand the full impact of the tax hike.† (Indeed, leaked emails from Walmart suggest the impact of the tax hike is much worse than we think.) However, Deutsche Bank's Joseph LaVorgna and Carl Riccadonna are particularly encouraged by one component of the recent retail sales report: auto sales. From DB: Additionally, January light unit motor vehicle sales totaled 15.3 million at an annual rate, the third-fastest pace since the last recession and barely down from Decemberís 15.4 million annualized tally. Thus far, consumers are not retrenching to the degree that many analysts feared. As a result, January retail sales are easily consistent with our expectation that personal consumption will rise at least 1.0% in the quarter, although the risks appear to be tilting toward a stronger number... Deutsche Bank Still, LaVorgna and Riccadonna will wait for the January income and spending report before they get really excited. ...the January personal income and spending report, which is released March 1, will provide significant additional information with respect to householdsí behavioral response to higher tax rates. In that report we will be watching in particular to see the overall trend in income growth (i.e. the dispersion between December and January due to tax optimizationóthis applies to both dividend and wage income), as well as the degree to which households may be dipping into savings (i.e. a lower savings rate) to support current quarter consumption. If households, confident in improving job and income prospects, decide to temporarily push their savings rate loweróthe economy could avoid the hit from the payroll tax hike...
When your country gets wealthier, you spend more of your money on things that aren't food. So it's not surprising that Chinese urban consumers now spend 14 percentage points less of their budget on food today than they did in 1995, US Funds' Frank Holmes. Holmes writes:† Within the country, more and more residents are relocating to the cities to get higher paid jobs and acquire discretionary income. In addition, government economic, social, rural and welfare policies are influencing the cost of goods. As a result, they're now spending much more on clothes and medicine: Jefferies via US Funds Holmes concludes that this is great news for Chinese stocks: ...reforming the hukou (urban residency) registration system will likely have a tremendous influence on Chinaís economy, and this is especially true in the consumer space. For the†China Region Fund, we believe stocks in the consumer discretionary sector will profit from the increasing renminbi in residentsí pockets.
CBS"Face the Nation" host Bob Schieffer ranted at Congress and the White House during a 90-second monologue Sunday, blaming collective Washington "ineptitude" for the spending cuts scheduled to kick in March 1 as a result of the sequester. CBS' Schieffer lamented that the sequester was "Washington's own doing." The policy, signed into law as a stipulation of the 2011 Budget Control Act, was designed based on "the idea was that no sane person would allow such cuts to happen." It looks increasingly likely to happen, despite Senate Democrats' introduction a proposal to avert the sequester last week. Schieffer said the purpose of such massive cuts was designed to make Congress take "responsible steps" toward deficit reduction. "Well, guess what," Schieffer said. "Even Washington managed to underestimate its own ineptitude. The sequester and the draconian cuts are about to happen, because the White House and Congress can't close the partisan divide and figure out what to do with them ó which is disheartening, to say the least." Schieffer, however, did find one bit of good news in the sequester. He referred to a quote from President Ronald Reagan about how in the event of an alien invasion, citizens of different countries would put aside their differences to work together. "If aliens do attack, our leaders will be well-rested to meet that challenge," Schieffer said sarcastically, pointing out how Congress is now on recess and President Barack Obama is vacationing this weekend in Florida.

Raising the minimum wage from $7.25 to $9 should be a no-brainer. Republicans say it will cause employers to shed jobs, but thatís baloney. Employers wonít outsource the jobs abroad or substitute machines for them because jobs at this low level of pay are all in the local personal service sector (retail, restaurant, hotel, and so on), where employers pass on any small wage hikes to customers as pennies more on their bills. States that have a minimum wage closer to $9 than the current federal minimum donít have higher rates of unemployment than do states still at the federal minimum. A mere $9 an hour translates into about $18,000 a year ó still under the poverty line. When you add in the Earned Income Tax Credit and food stamps itís possible to barely rise above poverty at this wage, but even the poverty line of about $23,000 understates the true cost of living in most areas of the country. Besides, the proposed increase would put more money into the hands of families that desperately need it, allowing them to buy a bit more and thereby keep others working. A decent society should do no less. Some conservatives say ìdecencyî has nothing to do with it. Who has the right to decide whatís decent? We should let the ìmarketî decide what people are paid. This is one of the oldest conservative canards in existence, based on the false claim that thereís something called a ìmarketî that exists separate from society. But thereís no ìmarketî in a state of nature, just survival of the fittest. A society necessarily determines how the ìmarketî is to be organized. Standards of morality and decency play a large role in those decisions. We set minimum standards for worker safety and consumer protection. We decide young children shouldnít be in the labor force. We do our best to prevent certain things from being bought and sold ó such as slaves, dangerous narcotics, babies, votes, sex with children, machine guns, nuclear material. We decide citizens shouldnít have to buy certain things that should instead be available to everyone free of charge (paid in effect by all of us through our taxes) ñ such as clean drinking water, K-12 schools, safe bridges, protection from violence, public parks. Opinions may differ about what decency requires, and we hash it out in a democracy. We might decide certain minimum standards are too costly or inefficient, or canít be enforced, or impose unwarranted constraints on our freedoms. Different societies come up with different answers. Handguns are banned in most other advanced nations, for example. Workers have more protections than they do in the United States. Minimum wages are higher. Taxes on the wealthy are higher. Healthcare is more universally available. Every society must necessarily decide for itself what decency requires. Thatís the very meaning of a ìsociety.î Donít fall for the mindless assertion that ìmarketsî know best. Markets are human creations, requiring human beings to decide how they are structured and maintained. The questions we face ñ whether to raise the minimum wage, restrict the availability of guns, expand healthcare coverage, and countless other decisions ñ inevitably require us to define what we mean by a decent society.

xJasonRogersxPart III ‚Äì Compound interest and Consumer Debt Please see earlier posts Part I ‚Äì¬†Why don‚Äôt they teach this in school¬†And Part II ‚ÄìCompound interest and Wealth So in the last post I wrote about the the incredible power of compound interest, and the possibility it suggests about wealth creation over time. Unfortunately, there‚Äôs also bad news. On the debt side of things, how much does your credit card company earn if you carry just an average of a $5,000 credit card balance, paying, say, 22% annual interest rate (compounding monthly) for the next 10 years? In your mind you owe a balance of only $5,000, which is not a huge amount, especially for someone gainfully employed.¬† After all, $5,000 is just a quick Disney trip, or a moderately priced ski-trip, or that week in Hawaii.¬† You think to yourself, ‚Äúhow bad could it be?‚Äù The answer, including the cost of monthly compounding[1], is $44,235, or about 9 times what it appears to cost you at face value.[2] I hate to be the Scrooge, but the power of compound interest transformed that moderate credit card balance of $5,000 into an extraordinarily expensive purchase.[3] ¬† Compound interest: Why the poor stay poor and the rich stay rich To take another example, let‚Äôs think of compound interest on credit cards for the average American household. Let‚Äôs say you are an average American household, and you carry an average balance of $15,956 in credit card debt. Also, as an average American household, let‚Äôs assume you pay an average current rate of 12.83%.[4] Finally, let‚Äôs assume you carry this average balance for 40 years, between ages 25 and 65.¬† How much did your credit card company make off of you and your extreme averageness? Answer: $2,629,618.64[5] So, in sum, your credit card company will earn from the average American household carrying a credit card balance for 40 years, $2.6 million.¬†[6] If you‚Äôre wondering why rich people tend to stay rich, and poor people tend to stay poor, may I offer you Exhibit A: Compound Interest. Now, your math teacher might not have done this demonstration for you in junior high, because he didn‚Äôt know about it.¬† Mostly, I forgive him.¬† Although not completely. You can be damned sure, however, that credit cards companies know how to do this math. ¬†THIS MATH IS THEIR ENTIRE BUSINESS MODEL. Which same business model would work a lot less well if everyone knew how to figure this stuff out on his own. Hence, my theory about the Financial Infotainment Industrial Complex suppressing the teaching of compound interest.¬† They don‚Äôt want you to learn how to figure out this math on your own.[7] Please see¬†Part I ‚Äì Why don‚Äôt they teach this in school? Part II ‚Äì¬†Compound interest and Wealth Part IV ‚Äì¬†Discounted cash flows Part V ‚Äì Discounted cash flows ‚Äì another example Part VI ‚Äì Conclusion and why everyone needs to know this math for the good of society [1]¬†But importantly, excluding all late fees, overbalance fees or penalty rates of interest. [2]¬†We get this result using the same formula, although Yield is divided by 12 to account for monthly compounding, and the N reflects the number of compounding periods, which is 120 months.¬† So the math is: $5,000 * (1+.22/12)120 [3]¬†Have you ever wanted to take a $45K vacation to Hawaii and pretend you‚Äôre a high roller?¬† Congratulations!¬† By carrying that $5K balance for 10 years, you did it!¬† You took a $45,000 Hawaiian vacation. You‚Äôre a high roller! Yay! [4]¬†All of these stats taken from this¬†great site on credit card statistics, which cites all of its sources. [5]¬†We express this again dividing yield by 12 to account for monthly compounding, and raising it to the power of 480 months, the number of compounding periods.¬† Hence the math is $15,956 * (1+.1283/12)480 [6]¬†I‚Äôm assuming for the purposes of this calculation that the debt balance stays constant for 40 years, but your household pays interest on the balance.¬† In calculating this result, please note I have framed the question in terms of ‚ÄúHow much does the credit card company earn‚Äù off of your household carrying this average balance for 40 years.¬† Which is not the same question as ‚ÄúHow much do you pay as a household?‚Äù¬† Embedded in my assumptions, and the compound interest formula, is the idea that the credit card company can continue to earn a fixed 12.83% on money you pay them.¬† Which I think is a fair way of analyzing how much money they can earn off your balance.¬† Since there are no shortages of other household credit card balances for the credit card company to fund at 12.83%, I believe this to be the most accurate way of calculating the credit card company‚Äôs earnings on your balance. [7]¬†Here‚Äôs where, for the sake of clarifying sarcasm on the internet ‚Äì which sometimes doesn‚Äôt translate well on the electronic page ‚Äì I should point out that I‚Äôm (mostly) kidding about the suppression of the compound interest formula.¬† Among the main reasons I started Bankers Anonymous was that the dim dialogue we have about finance as a society allows conspiracy theories to grown in darkness.¬† Just as pre-scientific societies depend on magic to explain mysterious phenomena, I think financially uninformed societies gravitate toward conspiracies to explain complex financial events.¬† As a former Wall Streeter who does not actually ascribe to conspiracy theories, I feel some obligation ‚Äòto amuse and inform‚Äô and thereby reduce the amount of conspiracy-mongering.¬† So, I don‚Äôt really think there‚Äôs a conspiracy here.¬† As far as you know.¬† Or maybe, that‚Äôs just what I want you to think.

Now a political espionage scandal has blown up, scattering debris and money laundering allegations far and wide. Unemployment in Spain was 26% in December, youth unemployment 55%. GDP last quarter dropped for the fifth month in a row (-0.7%), the steepest decline since the financial crisis. Consumer spending plunged 10% in December from prior year‚Äîfollowing a hike in the value-added tax. And the budget deficit target of 6.3% (not counting the billions plowed into bailing out the banks) is skidding out of reach. This leitmotif is accompanied by an elegantly escalating corruption scandal that broke in early February. A classic cash-for-contracts arrangement, where senior politicians received secret payments from business folks in return for juicy government contracts. It was documented in handwritten ledgers, involved a ‚Ç¨22 million slush fund in Switzerland, and was allegedly run by Luis B√°rcenas, the ex-treasurer of the conservative People‚Äôs Party (PP), the party of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, whose name appears repeatedly and very inconveniently on the ledgers as recipient [which put him and Chancellor Merkel on the corruption hot seat in Berlin.... The Confidence Crisis In Spain Sends Out Shock¬†Waves]. Add a political espionage scandal. The case blew up in a peculiar manner. According to sources‚Äîeverything in this case is ‚Äúaccording to sources‚Äù‚ÄîM√©todo 3, a detective agency in Barcelona, went out of business not long ago. One of its laid-off employees was an ex-cop, in charge of the data department. When M√©todo 3 couldn‚Äôt pay him what it owed him, he appropriated the computers, video and audio recordings, and a bunch of sensitive files. And they‚Äôve shown up at the technical division of the police in Barcelona. Now ‚Äúsources‚Äù are talking about what‚Äôs in this treasure-trove. Apparently M√©todo 3 had been commissioned by a long list of clients to spy on Catalan party leaders, politicians of national parties, judges, prosecutors, executives, and other prominent figures, sources told La Vanguardia. One of the recordings was of a lunch meeting at a restaurant in Barcelona in July 2010 between Alicia S√°nchez-Camacho, President of the PP in Catalonia, and a woman named Mar√≠a Victoria √Ålvarez. √Ålvarez was desperate and scared. She told S√°nchez-Camacho that she‚Äôd gone on a road trip to Andorra with her then-boyfriend, Pujol Ferrusola. The trunk was loaded with packets of 500-euro notes, which he deposited in a bank account there. She outlined how Pujol Ferrusola‚Äîson of powerbroker Jordi Pujol, leader of the Democratic Convergence of Catalonia (CDC) from 1974 to 2003 and President of Catalonia from 1980 to 2003‚Äîwas doing his family‚Äôs money laundering. She wanted to report him but feared for her life. So she asked S√°nchez-Camacho for help. The Pujol-Ferrusola family has been fingered in a police report that seeped to the surface in 2012. While Jordi Pujol was in power, companies associated with his sons were awarded lucrative contracts allegedly through false bidding. These cases had been investigated at the time, but nothing happened.... Until the recording of a conversation about a trunk full of euros popped up. On Thursday, √Ålvarez finally testified before the High Court about what she‚Äôd witnessed. Also on Thursday, S√°nchez-Camacho pressed charges with the police and filed a complaint in court against M√©todo 3. She‚Äôd found out by reading the papers that her lunch conversation had been recorded‚Äîand that the top official of the Catalan Socialist Party (PSC), Jos√© Zaragoza, at the time party secretary, had allegedly commissioned M√©todo 3 to do the dirty work. Interior Minister Jorge Fern√°ndez announced an ‚Äúexhaustive‚Äù investigation. ‚ÄúWe have a lot of information,‚Äù he said ominously. Zaragoza and others accused of anything whatsoever have denied everything. Sources have told La Vanguardia that the materials are so massive that the police have formed a special team, supported by police units from Madrid, to investigate them. The lunch episode uncovered a web of ‚Äúunpredictable scope.‚Äù The investigation is still in an early stage, sources said, but the client list of M√©todo 3 is long and ‚Äúdelicate,‚Äù and includes officials of various political parties and institutions, and the number of people tangled up in it is vast. ‚ÄúThis is about top politicians,‚Äù said the sources. These revelations are driving the political elite ever deeper into a malodorous morass just when that same elite is forcefully tightening the belts of the people. Workers have taken pay cuts, social benefits have been trimmed, families have lost their homes, the VAT, which hits everyone, has been jacked up, all to squeeze the maximum from those who still have any juice left. Yet, Spain‚Äôs legal system wasn‚Äôt designed to root out corruption; and Rajoy, among others, may be thinking that this too shall pass. Corruption of spectacular proportions is dogging another Eurozone country waiting for a bailout. Buried deep inside a report on Russia‚Äôs booming underground economy and illicit oil money is a gem: the flows and amounts of Russian ‚Äúblack money‚Äù into and out of Cyprus. They‚Äôre huge.

The Wheat market is definitely in a downtrend right now, and if we look at the 6 month chart we stand at $7.42 a bushel as of the close of last week. If we break $7.20 a bushel, then there are going to be a lot of sell stops positioned to sell Wheat lower to the next level of support at $6.84 a bushel. If this level fails to hold look out below as $5.85 is the next major level of support on the five-year weekly continuation chart and should hold.¬† Support Levels Now Wheat should bounce around the $7.00 a bushel area, probably first busting through it, and then spiking above it as price tries to find its equilibrium after establishing a new low. And obviously $6.00 a bushel provides a level of support being both a round number, which is heavily guarded, and near the two year low in the contract. This is another area where I would expect Wheat to first push below $6.00 a bushel, then spike above it several times before making a strong run at the $5.85 level. www.econmatters.com The Death Cross Interestingly we had the proverbial ‚ÄúDeath Cross‚Äù in early January where the 50-day moving average crossed below the 200-day moving average which actually signaled a buy to many traders initially as price spiked to retest the $8.00 a bushel level, but soon faded and has been putting in lower highs and lower lows ever since.¬† I often see that where a bearish technical signal is faded by buyers thinking selling and bearish sentiment is overdone. This is why I am often cautious when the media starts discussing Death Crosses, this often offers up contra-trend trading opportunities in the market.¬† However, ultimately the Death Cross in Wheat proved to be prophetic as Wheat has confirmed that it is still in a bearish downtrend as each price spike is met with many sellers waiting patiently to enter in the direction of the trend, and eventually pushing the contract lower with each bearish thrust of price momentum. www.econmatters.com Trading Philosophy Now I will talk a little about the psychology and underlying trading philosophy that plays out in the price discovery process. Wheat is a commodity, and commodities trend, and there are two main types of traders in these markets. 1) The traders who are looking at value in relation to historical Wheat prices the last two years, and they are looking for areas to buy and go long. 2) Then there are the traders who look at the market in the exact opposite manner. They see Wheat at these lower levels as a sign of weakness, and they are looking to sell new lows.¬†It is a battle that plays out in price in many instruments, and one side eventually wins, forcing the other side to cover their position. There isn`t a rigid definition on why one side will always win because at some point it is definitely wrong to sell a bottom and buy a top, just look at the historical tops and bottoms on the charts provided to ascertain that conclusion. Some buyers and sellers bought the very top and sold the very bottom of the Wheat market the last five years.¬† www.econmatters.com Prudent Money Management This is where proper money management techniques with strategically placed stops come into play. The ability to understand that momentum has shifted, the trade is invalidated, and price is going the other direction. Furthermore, it is underestimated the importance of being able to be flexible to get on the train going in the opposite direction of the original price assumption.¬† www.econmatters.com Invalidation Signals Price tells them where the trade is invalidated; it literally forces the other side to cover at key technical reversals, which is your sign to be out of a trade if large numbers of positions are going to be forced out automatically via stops at key technical invalidation levels.¬† Always look for technical areas where other traders would think the trade is invalidated, and place their stops. Sure there are stop runs and trading noise; and this is where feel comes into trading and strategically placing stops to avoid the creative stop runs and noise, and be on the right side of the price action to come in the direction of the trend.¬† www.econmatters.com And the winner is‚Ä¶ So there will be a lot of battles to come in the Wheat market between these two trading camps the value buyers and the trend sellers, and it is your job to determine who is going to ultimately win out, and the charts and technical analysis is your tool to help you in this quest. The Fundamentals Sure the fundamentals are underlying these moves, and with high prices over most of the last 4 years, soaring farm land prices, and wealthy and fat farmers, things have been good in the agriculture space, and this probably plays out in some bumper crops if the weather cooperates. This is economic theory playing out putting downward pressure on Wheat prices.¬† Be careful of ‚ÄúValue Traps‚Äù! So at what price does the market determine that Wheat prices are a value? This should be taken into an analysis along with the fact that commodities trend, and they gain momentum runs, and areas where buyers and sellers have thought represented real value, failed to offer that for these investors, and their having to cover their ‚Äòvalue investments‚Äô provided additional fuel in the direction of the trend, i.e., prices can go in a trending direction far more than any investor rationally thinks is possible.¬† Just look at the chart and that $13.00 a bushel Wheat price was a pain induced short covering rally that investors who came in ‚Äòvalue shorting‚Äô at $10.00, $11.00 and $12.00 a bushel thought was unreachable, i.e., or they would have waited until $13.00 to come in and short. So price can always go far lower or higher than one would think ahead of time in any market, but in commodities especially be careful not to make price assumptions.¬† Blood in the water In summary, if Wheat gains momentum to the downside due to larger than expected bumper Wheat crops, and some key technical levels are broken, the trend traders will be piling on, and the value investors will be testing their pain threshold.¬† Additional sharks will appear as the blood in the water of lower prices in a down trending market brings even more attention to the Wheat market, and before you know it outsiders who never thought of trading Wheat are pushing the contract lower causing more pain; that is how extreme levels in price get established in a forced liquidation process. If the Wheat market gains some more downward momentum, traders will see just how far they can push it lower. One has to be careful in picking bottoms because of this very fact, price invariably goes so much lower than you think is rationally possible.¬† Bottom Picking &amp; Rewards But as always the flip side is that if you pick the near term bottom, then you can get some exceptionally profitable bargains because price was pushed way to low or way to high. It helps if a big buyer or seller steps in right after the levels that you decide to enter the trade, as then you can comfortably move your stop up to guarantee a riskless free-roll on a trade.¬† These are the holy grail moments in trading: you pick a top or bottom and a big player agrees with your market assumption; your trade is instantly profitable, highly protected, you experience no heat, and your only concern is where to place the stop to protect your profit but remain in the trade for the potential of a sustained trend in the new direction of the market.¬© EconMatters All Rights Reserved | Facebook | Twitter | Post Alert | Kindle     Read more posts on EconMatters ¬ª
Republican House Budget Chair Paul Ryan laid the blame on Democrats Sunday for failing to avoid the sequester, accusing the Senate and the White House of showing "no leadership" on budget issues.† ìThereís no leadership on the other side of the aisle and therefore no agreement," Ryan said in an interview with ABC's "This Week." ìThe Senate hasnít passed a bill to replace the sequester. The president gave a speech showing that heíd like to replace it, but he hasnít put any details out there. So that is why I conclude I believe itís going to take place."† Ryan also dismissed the proposal released by Senate Democrats last week, which would replace the sequester for 10 months through a combination of new tax revenues and spending cuts.† ìIíd be curious to see if they could actually pass that, number one. Number two, the president got his tax increases last year. He got those higher revenues,î Ryan said. ìBut taking tax loopholes, what weíve always advocated is necessary for tax reform, means youíre going to close loopholes to fuel more spending, not to reform the tax code.î
There was something important coming from the G20 meeting, but it is not the currency wars that have captured so many imaginations in the media and blogosphere. It was about corporate taxes, but before turning to it, let's try to put the currency statement in perspective. As many recognize, the currency market is prone to being used to pursue beggar-thy-neighbor policies of competitive devaluations. ¬†The danger is that it leads to trade wars and then shooting wars. ¬†The rules of engagement, as they have evolved over the last quarter of a century or so, are essentially three-fold. First, exchange rates are not proper goals of policy. ¬†Economic growth and price stability are the proper goals of policy. ¬†Second, foreign exchange prices are best set by the market in a flexible way to help foster the adjustment process and a reduction of global disequilibrium in terms of trade and capital flows. ¬†Third, while avoiding excess volatility, currency prices ought to reflect underlying economic fundamentals and avoid chronic exchange rate misalignments. ¬† On those rare occasions when action, is needed, it should be coordinated and not unilateral. ¬† The G20 statement, like the G7 statement earlier in the week, restated these longstanding principles. ¬†That members agree not to target exchange rates for competitive purposes was a pointed reminder to Japanese officials to refrain from talking about bilateral exchange rate targets. ¬†And indeed, over the past couple of weeks, Japanese officials have changed their rhetoric and have not talked about specific dollar-yen rates. ¬† Rarely in stories about currency wars has China been cited. ¬†Yet, it is an indicated co-conspirator, as it were. ¬†The G20 reference to moving more rapidly toward market determined exchange rates ¬†and the importance of avoiding persistent misalignments was clearly addressed to China, and some other East Asian and Middle East countries. The rules of engagement allow and encourage countries to pursue monetary and fiscal policies directed at domestic goals. ¬†For several years Japan has been encouraged to reflate its economy. ¬†That it appears to be doing so is not problem. ¬†No one in the G7 or the G20 have objected to that. ¬†The criticism levied against Japanese officials is when they try to manage the currency, suggesting certain targets, and/or overt attempts by the government to undermine what is seen as the independence of the central bank (which we have argued here and here it is not quite what it seems). It also means that the (unconventional) easing of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve is also not an act of (currency) war. ¬†Leaving aside the occasional comment by Brazil's finance minister and a rare comment by a Chinese official, few in positions of responsibility accuse the US of engaging in a competitive devaluation. ¬† The referees of the rules of engagement as it were, like the IMF, the G20 and the G7 generally agree that although the risks may be there, the conditions and practices now do not meet the threshold of competitive devaluations, a currency war or trade war. ¬†We expect the rhetoric in the traditional and social media about currency wars will die down in the coming period. II¬† The focus on currency wars distracts from other and arguably more important issues. ¬†Much of coverage of the G20 statement focused on the foreign exchange market, but has missed what is likely an even more important story. The G20 have begun a process that could lead to the largest overhaul of international corporate tax practices since the 1920s. ¬†The combination of the fiscal pressures at home and the increased importance of intellectual property (e.g., royalties, licensing fees) and questionable transfer pricing corporate practices has elicited a response. ¬† The official goal is to develop measures to stop tax arbitrage--the shifting of profits from home countries in order to pay lower taxes elsewhere. ¬†A recent OECD study found multinational companies were increasingly booking profits in different countries from where they were generated in order to avoid taxes. The role of intangibles, like intellectual property rights, services and brands have grown in importance but are difficult to value. ¬†International royalty and license fee payments paid to different subsidiaries within the same business group have soared. ¬†The growing volume of e-commerce also raises issues of the proper tax jurisdiction that are not handled well by the current tax rules. ¬† This comes even as OECD government have cut statutory corporate tax rates from an average of 32.6% in 2000 to 25.4% in 2011. ¬†The effective tax rate, which is what corporations actually pay, is often much lower due to assorted deductions and allowances. Recent reports showing that a number of large well-known global companies, such as Starbucks, Apple, Google, Amazon used complicated inter-company transaction to reduce their tax liabilities has helped spur official action. ¬† The big accounting firms are also being called out for the assistance they provide in helping businesses avoid taxes. ¬† Essentially, the OECD has called for, and the G20 appears to have signed off on, a new effort to modernize the international tax architecture, which could be ready in the next couple of years. ¬†Three committees have been established and more from them will likely be heard around the July G20 meeting. ¬† The UK will head up a committee to look at transfer prices and the sales to subsidiaries to shift profits from high to low tax jurisdictions. ¬†It is illegal, for example, to structure a particular transaction for the purpose of skirting the law (it is sometimes referred to as "kiting"). ¬†For example, it is unlawful for one to withdraw $5000 twice instead of withdrawing $10,000 once in order to avoid reporting requirements. ¬†Can the same principle apply to businesses?¬† Germany will head up a committee that investigates way in which companies have reduced the tax base in the accounting of income and assets. ¬†France and the US will lead the third committee, looking at e-commerce in particular, and the proper tax jurisdictions. ¬† The Obama Administration has been wrestling with the same issue. ¬†Once we get past the sequester and the continuing resolution (authorizes government spending even without a budget), look for corporate tax reform to become more salient. ¬†The fact that it will come after the other events, gives Obama some leverage with the business community, even when it came to the fiscal cliff. ¬† It is ironic that Obama, who has been accused of being a socialist, is on record of favoring corporate tax reform that include a cut in the top corporate rate to 28% from 35%. ¬†More important than the loopholes he wants to close to pay for the tax cut, is how overseas earnings should be taxed.¬† Currently, the US taxes corporate profits earned abroad only when it is repatriated--brought back to the US. ¬†Last month, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service reported that US-based companies are increasingly shifting profits to tax havens such as Bermuda and Switzerland. ¬†Senator Sanders (VT) has introduced legislation to end the current tax deferral and force companies to pay taxes on their foreign earnings. ¬†Some studies suggest that the higher levels of cash ¬†US corporations are holding is partly a function of these tax avoidance efforts. At the end of last year, Obama expressed some sympathy for some form of territorial system, which taxes domestic not foreign income. ¬†It could exempt offshore corporate profits from US taxes, seemingly shifting the stance of the 2012 election campaign. ¬†Currently, France, the Netherlands, Belgium and Hong Kong employ a territorial tax system.¬† The currency wars have been over-hyped. ¬†There is less there than meets the eye. ¬†The rules of engagement allow for countries to use monetary and fiscal policy for domestic goals. ¬†It does not sanction foreign exchange targeting. ¬†The real news from the G20 meeting is the formal beginning of a process that could very well lead the largest substantial change in international corporate tax system in almost a century. ¬† Read more posts on Marc to Market ¬ª
The first article of this series identified the typical financial conditions that resulted in bank closings by the FDIC and then showed how those same conditions have tracked for the entire banking industry throughout the entire period of our most recent financial crisis. In todayís article I will present a view of the Income side of the banking industryóprior to and throughout our recent banking crisis, which by the way, is just now finally returning to a more steady state level of business similar to pre-crisis levels.† In doing so, I will provide the reader information that will enable income comparisons to be made between the following four banks: (1) Bank of America, (2) JPMorgan/Chase; (3) Citigroup, (4) Wells Fargo, and the rest of the U.S. banking industry. The approach to my analysis is financially-sound and can be replicated by anyone who has access to the internet and the FDICís banking database, which is essentially everyone in the world, including the banking regulators in Washington, DC. ††Here are the steps to that approach: Exhibit 1 provides a good example of how to use this approach to evaluate the most significant of the banking crisis income statement categoriesóLoan Loss Provisions, the income statement category that the banks use to write off loan losses. Exhibit 1 † Jim Boswell Besides many other things Exhibit 1 offers the neophyte a good look at what a typical housing banking crisis looks like throughout the crisis lifespan.† Here are some of the more important things to recognize. Exhibit 1 could have been plotted in terms of loans loss provisions to ìloan assetsî in lieu of ìtotal assetsî.† The magnitude of the curves would have plotted differently, offering additional insight relating to bank loan performance; however, in order to be consistent throughout this particular income set of analysis, it was more appropriate to use the same parameter (total assets) for every income statement line item.† In this particular analysis I used the eleven-quarter period (03/31/2005 to 09/30/2007) to establish my benchmark measurements for the pre-crisis period.† Why that period?† Well first of all, eleven quarters of data were sufficient to establish a steady state benchmarkóusing more quarters would not have changed the results.† And secondly, by the quarter ending 12/31/2007 (three quarters prior to TARP) the banks and the regulators should have known a problem was brewing because two major operational benchmarks (non-performing assets and real estate owned properties) had already doubled from steady state levels and the provisions for loan losses as shown in Exhibit 1 had already nearly quadrupled. What I believe is important to understand is that essentially the area below each line in Exhibit 1 and above the steady state level (shown as the horizontal line 0.78%) from the period from 12/31/2007 onward represents bank losses above and beyond those of the prior pre-crisis period.† Exhibit 2 shows the results for each of the Big Four Banks and the rest of the U.S. Banking community using this same approach for the major income/expense categories on the standard banking income statement. † Exhibit 2 Bank Gains (Losses) by Income Statement Category Above Pre-Crisis Levels Over Last Five-Year Crisis Period (Dollars in Billions) Jim Boswell One exampleóLoan Loss Provisions for Bank of America--should suffice to explain the above table.† From the data plotted in Exhibit 1, the difference in Bank of Americaís ìAverage Quarterlyî Loan Loss Provisions between pre-crisis ($0.0986 per $100 of Assets) and crisis period ($0.3630 per $100 of Assets) is $0.2644 per $100 of Assets.† Over the twenty-quarter crisis period, Bank of America had on average $1.715 Trillion in Assetsóthus the calculation -$0.2644 times ($1,715,000,000,000/100) times 20 quarters = $90.7 billion.†Interestingóisnít it?† I will leave it to the reader to decipher most of the above table on his or her own; however, a few things are worth pointing out. One thing that may not be clear from the above table is that the banks ìdid not actually lose moneyî during the crisis.† But isnít that a contradiction from what you have just been showing us, Jim? Not really.† You must remember, what I have presented is the difference between what the banks made during the last five-year crisis period compared to what they would have made if they would have continued to make money at the rate they did prior to the crisis.† Exhibit 3 may provide you a better way to view the real impact on the Big Four banks and the rest of the U.S. banking community.† Exhibit 3 †Jim Boswell Exhibit 3 shows the overall quarterly income to asset level as reported by each of the Big Four banks and for the rest of the U.S. banking community for (1) the eleven-quarter pre-crisis period; (2) the five-year crisis period; and (3) the last four quarters of our crisis.† I believe the Exhibit speaks for itself and will point out only that the percentage figures shown on the Last Five-Year and Last Four-Quarter bars are in relation to the Pre-Crisis bar for each of the entities shown.† Note that in no case in the above graph did the income/asset ratio become negative. Now I would like to end by saying this.† It is very difficult to cover up mistakes within regularly reported and standardly-accepted financial data over an extended period of timeóespecially from ìquantsî and regulators that know what to look for.† And in todayís world the problem with identifying crises before they happen is not generally due to a lack of data, but with those people in charge who do not know what to look for. Well, that is it for todayís discussion relating to bank transparency.† Next week, depending upon feedback, I intend to dig deeper†into my†income analysis, otherwise I may turn my attention more towards how the different bank balance sheet asset categories have changed between the pre-crisis and post-crisis periods.† That, too, is an interesting subject on its own.
Joe Scarborough, a man comically ill at ease with†numbers,†Powerpoint, or any analysis that doesn't involve polling Beltway insiders, thinks Paul Krugman is†crazy†for worrying more about unemployment than the long-term debt right now.† In other words, Scarborough can't believe Krugman says we can wait until Medicare spending is a problem before doing more about it. Of course, the arithmophobic Scarborough can't explain why Krugman is wrong ó aside from saying everybody he talks to thinks so too ó which is why Scarborough outsourced the job to the senior economist at the RAND corporation. But, unfortunately for Scarborough, he seems to have found an economist who doesn't know much about the subject ó at least judging from the freshman-level errors throughout. Here are the lowlights from this piece, ostensibly arguing that long-term debt is our gravest short-term economic problem. (Note: Excerpts are italicized). 1) From the beginning of 2002, when U.S. government debt was at its most recent minimum as a share of GDP, to the end of 2012, the dollar lost 25 percent of its value, in price-adjusted terms, against a basket of the currencies of major trading partners. This may have been because investors fear that the only way out of the current debt problems will be future inflation. It wasn't. Inflation was low, and investors didn't expect that to change, over the last decade. Core PCE inflation averaged 1.9 percent over this period, while 10-year breakevens, which tell us market expectations of future inflation (going back to 2003), averaged 2.18 percent. Now, the financial crisis depressed both inflation and inflation expectations, but, as you can see in the chart below, the latter mostly leveled off around a healthy 2.5 percent for most of the last 10 years. If markets feared future inflation in the face of mounting debt, they sure had a funny way of showing it. The Atlantic This persistently low inflation, and expectations thereof, meant the Fed could, and did, keep interest rates low ó and lower rates tend to cause a lower dollar. In other words, this wasn't a story about debt. Indeed, as you can see in the chart below, the big decline in the dollar happened between 2002 and 2007, when debt levels were relatively low, while the dollar is actually higher today than it was in 2008, despite the big debt run-up. The Atlantic 2)†More troubling for the future is that private domestic investmentóthe fuel for future economic growthóshows a strong negative correlation with government debt levels over several business cycles dating back to the late 1950s. Continuing high debt does not bode well in this regard. This is a correlation masquerading as a legitimate point. Recessions happen when private investment falls, and recessions increase deficits and debt due to lower revenues and higher safety net spending. In other words, deficits and debt rise because investment has fallen, not vice versa. Now, it's true that too-big deficits can crowd out private investment during a boom ó that's the legitimate point ó but we know that's not a problem now since interest rates are still so low. 3) But the economics profession is beginning to understand that high levels of public debt can slow economic growth, especially when gross general government debt rises above 85 or 90 percent of GDP. As†Mike Konczal†of the Roosevelt Institute points out, the idea that growth slows down when debt hits 90 percent of GDP has not been proven. It's just a correlation. And, again, it probably gets the causation backwards ó low growth causes high deficits and debt, not vice versa. 4) The U.S. share of global economic output has been falling since 1999óby nearly 5 percentage points as of 2011. As America's GDP share declined, so did its share of world trade, which may reduce U.S. influence in setting the rules for international trade. It's not clear what cutting Medicare would do about China's rapid rise. Poorer countries tend to grow faster than richer ones ó that is, they converge ó and that won't change regardless of whether we raise the eligibility age for Medicare or not. And besides, a richer China (and India, and Brazil, and ...) is good for us, if not our power, since it means more markets for our goods. It's odd that the same people who argue against progressive taxation because growth isn't zero-sum take a decidedly different view when it comes to international growth. *** This entire debate is a bit surreal. Nobody disputes that healthcare spending, including Medicare, is on an unsustainable trajectory. It's a matter of what to do to "bend the curve" and when to do it. Scarborough wants to increase the eligibility age, and he doesn't think it can wait, because ... well, it's not clear why.†He's not saying anything bond investors don't already know, and yet the inflation-adjusted yield on the 30-year bond is only†0.61 percent. If Scarborough is right and bond investors are wrong, then there's a tremendous money-making opportunity in shorting long-term bonds. I wonder if he has the courage of this particular conviction. But there's another reason, quiescent bond vigilantes aside, for waiting to deal with our long-term debt. We need more time to figure out how to do it. If we knew how to slow healthcare inflation, we would have slowed healthcare inflation. But we don't. Now, Obamacare introduced payment reforms and "death panels" (IPAB ó the Independent Payment Advisory Board) to try to restrain spending, but we don't know if or how much they'll work, though there are some hopeful signs. The CBO just reported that healthcare spending has slowed so much the past few years that it's revised down projected federal healthcare spending by†$200 billion over the rest of the decade†ó or $50 billion more than†raising the eligibility age†from 65 to 67 would save. In other words, the things we know how to do won't save that much, and the things we don't know how to do might save much more. That's why we should play for more time. Our elites are good at manufacturing crises, if nothing else, but Scarborough can't manufacture a debt crisis today. Markets won't cooperate ó and with good reason. They're more concerned about growth than debt, because they've†done the math and realize the†former is the only solution to the latter.† Don't tell anyone, but Powerpoint might have been involved.
Wikimedia Commons/ America's WallpapersWith so many different types of market players on Wall Street these days, we're always curious about how they go about executing various strategies.† Las Vegas-based volatility trader Robert Blau, the founder of RABCO, spoke with Business Insider about his strategy and outlook for the markets. This is especially timely because volatility is at multi-year lows.† We've transcribed our interview below. †(Note: It has been lightly edited for clarity). † JL: I see you have a "collateralized options trading strategy," could you explain what that means? † RB:†Sure. What I started doing about fifteen years ago is trading options, primarily selling options, selling volatility. So I'm what you would call a volatility trader. †And the collateral part is basically when you're selling options you need to post collateral, generally in the form of cash, Treasury bills, could be municipal bonds. †They just want to see that you have the way to pay off if the options sale doesn't work out. That's why we call it 'collateralized options trading strategy.' JL: Why is it that options markets are so inefficient compared to the S&amp;P? RB: Well, I don't know if I would say that they're 'inefficient.' †I think that the options strategy that I employ is selling options on the S&amp;P 500 index. †Primarily, what I'm doing on the put side is selling disaster insurance. So if a hedge fund, for example, is concerned about some kind of macro event that is going to occur and they want to reduce their exposure they are buying this type of insurance to hedge their portfolio rather than just sell their stock and sell their position. And so generally there's more demand for this product that there are sellers and what happens is that premium that kind of gets built into the pricing due to the fact that most people really don't want to sell the insurance. So the people who would be critics of this strategy would say that 'theoretically you're selling this insurance, but you could blow yourself up.' My answer to them would be that over long periods of time that natural, historical volatility in the market is less than the implied volatility that these hedge fund managers end up paying to buy it. And so, again, it has been considered a risk strategy, you know it's certainly not a conservative strategy, but the management of the options is really the key to my success and that comes from many years of battle wounds living through you name itóSeptember 11th, Flash Crash, and all the crazy stuff that's happened over the last 15 years. †The list is very long. †† JL: Would you say this is analogous to how some insurance companies make their money? † RB: Absolutely. It's analogous to insurance. †The best way to describe it is when people ask me to put it into plain English for non-Wall Street people, it's definitely like selling insurance. It's kind of like you live in New York and you hear that the hurricane is forming out in the Caribbean and someone comes up to you and says, 'Do you want to buy hurricane insurance?' and you're saying, ''Nah, I don't really think so,' and they're saying, 'c'mon, it's only a $1,000' and you're like, 'Nah, forget it.' And then the hurricane starts moving up and now it's in Florida and they come back to you again and say, 'do you want to buy hurricane insurance?' and you start to think about it a little bit more, but now the price is $2,000. And then eventually when the hurricane gets to Washington, D.C., the price is $5,000 and you're ready to buy it. So it is analagous to that. †The other side of the coin is when you think of it like car insurance, and you say 'Well, I need a policy for the year for my family.' It's a $12,000 policy and three months goes by and you turn around to your insurance agent and you say, 'I'm canceling. †I want my premium back.' What happens to those three months? They earn premium. They keep your money and at the end of the day that's how they make money. †So yes these types of puts and insurance premiums are very often done. †Warren Buffett sells puts on the S&amp;P. †Basically, they used options, not my S&amp;P options, but it was all these options that were being sold you know basically that's what the CDS wasóthey were options on these bonds that no one ever thought would collapse. So people thought they were collecting free premiums, but ended up getting blown out. †So there's a fairly ugly side to options. I think that's why people tend to shun them. †But I think if it's done with experience and with a good degree of fear, you have to be scared of it and understand what you're dealing with, I think there are crumbs that can be made you know from people who are paying up very often what's overpriced. JL:†OK. †So when I look at your returns from your performance it looks like, it kind of looks like how when the casino has to pay out the jackpot. †There are some months in here that are volatile like April 2007, October 2008, August 2011 would that be analagous...? RB:†Yes. The nature of the strategy and the nature of the "bets" so to speak if you want to call them that what I make is that 80 to 90% of the time they work in my favoróI'm like the house. But upon occasion...the snakeyes comes up and the casino loses. †So yes, that's exactly, you hit it right on the head, that's exactly analagous to kind of being the house in a casino.† JL: †But I also see a lot of really consistent returns. †Why do you think you manage to generate such consistent returns and you know what is it about options that produces this sort of opportunity?† RB:†Well, like I said the nature of the strategy is that...The way I do it is I sell very low probability bets meaning †low probability for the buyer and high probability for me. So the majority of times I'm going to win. †Usually you have some kind of event once every twelve months and that event may be a very large one like August of 11 with the downgrade of the credit rating, which kind of caught me by surprise. Once they raised the debt ceiling I thought the waters were clear only to get turned around on the downgrade, which affected me badly. †But with that being said, the majority of times I win so the majority of times I do get that consistent return. †The trick is to manage you know the September 11th event or the downgrade event. †When those events happen, you have to manage it. You can't be a deer in headlights. You have to work and that's probably the biggest dilemma that people have had doing this is that if they don't manage effectively and those certain moments they can really lose a lot of money. †I think the consistency there is because the nature of the bets I'm selling have a very low probability of success of the buyer of the options and a high probability of success for me. And why I think that would exist is because you know is when you think about insurance ó car insurance companies, hurricane, all kinds of insurance that someone would buy ó overtime... What happens if there's a Hurricane Sandy? You know yes they take a loss. But what happens for the next three years in that region? Everyone's premiums are going to go up to reflect it. So the insurance business as a business in general has been a huge successful cash flow type of business for you know lots of companies...all making money basically selling a degree of risk and if there is an issue the premiums come up to follow it. †If you kind of look a little deeper into the returns, you'll see when I have two kind of bad months so to speak the following three to six months thereafter are usually pretty strong because the options in market place are trading much higher and people are willing to pay much more when they're coming off a scary event. So you do take a loss, but you do also then get the opportunity to sell you know future months a much higher implied volatility.† JL: Is this a strategy that most people could execute, or does it take a lot of experience?† RB: You could read about it in a book. †It's not that I've invented anything new as far as selling options, but the experience yes. †The experience is going through staring at the market, watching how the market behaves and knowing how to manage when the problems occur. And that's something someone could talk to you about, but until you're in the middle of one of those types of events when you have a 500 point swing day, a 1,000 point swing day and these option prices are starting to scream. †That experience is irreplaceable, so yeah I would say the experience and the management of the strategy is really more of the key than anything else. JL: So where do most people who execute this type of strategy makes mistakes?† RB: They make mistakes in not cutting losses and managing positions in a timely and effective manner. † Just one little side note, back to your last question...I had a mentor who was doing this who kind of took me under his wing. †That's kind of where you know I learned on the job, but going back fifteen years when I first started it wasn't that I was all on my own. I had someone who was doing this for many years prior. He absolutely was one of the largest retail accounts at Goldman Sachs who was doing this strategy and he kind of took me under his wing and looked over my shoulder and coached me, so maybe that gives you a little better explanation.† JL: OK. †The biggest mistakes would be not cutting losses, not managing positions...† RB:†Right. When you're a trader, you have to have trading discipline and I think the biggest mistake that people make is not adhering to their trading plan and their trading discipline. JL: So you've been doing this for fifteen years. What did you do before that? RB: †Prior to starting this strategy, which really I started for myself, friends and family and really I run it as a small business. †It's not a huge, big hedge fund. †But prior to that I was very involved in many different entrepreneurial ventures in and around the Tri state area when we lived in New York. †Some of them were entertainment related. So it's kind of interesting that Justin got involved in show business.†(Note: Blau's son Justin is DJ 3LAU) ...As you've heard his story. My hope would have been that he went into finance at least initially, but now I'm thrilled about what he's doing.† JL: †What's your outlook for the market this year and are there any big themes that you're looking at?† RB: "For me, the decisions that I make primarily are based on technical analysis more than fundamental analysis although when you have these Greek votes and these debt ceiling dates and all these kind of timelines certainly have to get factored in. For me, I'm looking more at volatility so you know right now the volatility is multi-multi-year low.† JL: Right, the VIX. RB: You've got the VIX and the VIX is very low. The VIX is very low because, you know, yes it's directly related to central banks printing money and this general sense that government's will interfere with the markets in anyway that they can to kind of stabilize things and that has kind of eliminated a lot of the fear prospect. But that will change. Over 15 years there have been these †kind of periods. And if you look back kind of at a chart of the VIX over extended periods of time you'll see that when you start getting down to these 12, 13, 10 kind of levels, at least over the last 15 years, look what happens next on the chart. You know the chart is, the VIX is shooting up. So something is going to happen. We don't know what it is if it's going to be a war, if it's going to be Bernanke when they stop printing $85 billion a month of money maybe that's...Something's going to happen and the volatility will increase. It won't stay at this level and that's really what I'm looking at... JL: Since volatility has compressed recently, is it more difficult to execute they type of strategy?† RB: Well I would say that through the course of the year as volatility moves up and down there are better times and worse times... So yeah it's a little tougher right now, but you never know what's right around the corner. Usually you get enough cycles through the year...There's enough opportunities throughout the year cycle where I will be able to achieve my desired goals.† JL: Thank you so much.

Loeb, who runs Third Point, started selling a few weeks ago and has continued to trade around the position, the source said, including this past Friday when shares surged. Third Point maintains a position in Herbalife, the source said. Loeb's initial investment placed him squarely against another hedge fund titan, William Ackman, whose billion dollar short bet and fiery battle with Carl Icahn has been the talk of Wall Street ever since the two men brawled on CNBC's "Halftime Report" on Jan. 25. (Read More: Icahn, Ackman in Epic Showdown of Billionaires) Icahn revealed on Thursday evening, through a filing, his own long position in the company which caused shares to soar. In a live interview on CNBC on Friday, Icahn said he believes the company is undervalued.

In the past few weeks global markets have focused on the weakening yen, as politicians and business leaders, particularly in Europe have called for a halt in Japan's "weak currency" policy. Tokyo's efforts to stimulate it's export sector have become front and center topic in the financial media, as global businesses become increasingly concerned about the currency war. In fact the number of FT articles containing the word "yen" hit a record recently. Sober LookNumber of FT articles containing ‚Äúyen‚Äù (source: Merrill Lynch) Similarly, Google search frequency for "JPY" rose recently as well. ¬†Sober LookGoogle Trends for "JPY" Public's attention has therefore turned to the G20 meeting this week, where some have hoped Japan would be asked to moderate its policy. The Eurozone is particularly concerned that the relative strength of the euro will delay its exit from the economic malaise. Germany for example is in direct competition with Japan in auto sales, and a relatively small change in the EUR/JPY levels could result in major differences in sales and profit margins. But with the world watching and the Germans hoping for action against Japan, the US quickly stepped in to support Japan's policy. After all the US has been following a similar policy itself. This NY Times article described the situation quite well: NY Times: - Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, strongly indicated on Friday that the United States did not intend to censure Japan for weakening its currency over the last several months, something that has aided Japanese exporters and angered its competitors.Mr. Bernanke spoke in brief introductory remarks at a conference in Moscow of the Group of 20, a club of the world‚Äôs largest industrial and emerging economies.At issue are stimulus programs backed by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who is also maintaining pressure on the Bank of Japan to keep interest rates near zero and flood the economy with money to support Japanese manufacturers. As a result, the yen has lost about 15 percent of its value against the dollar over the last three months, meaning products made in Japan, like some Sony electronics or models of Toyota cars, are relatively cheaper.Japan‚Äôs maneuver touched off fears that other countries and the European Union might follow suit in a so-called currency war, which has been the main topic of the Group of 20 meeting here, which runs through Saturday.Initially, it seemed the world‚Äôs largest economies might agree on a firm statement at the end of the meeting to condemn a currency war, or competitive devaluations. This tactic is now widely seen as a beggar-thy-neighbor approach to creating growth that would ultimately harm a global recovery and is understood to be a cause of the lingering nature of the depression in the 1930s. This is likely to drive a further wedge between the Fed's and the ECB's policy, while angering many politicians in Europe. Through his statements at the G20 meeting, Bernanke in effect just gave his nod to the continuation of the currency war.
By EconMattersTrading: State of the UnionI was visiting a large Oil trading floor last year, and they were having their big state of the union town hall on the floor and the CEO of the group that trading and marketing rolled up into talked about the dying volatility in general saying that they could hold on for a couple more years with this level of volatility, but if this continued for 5 or 6 years they were in trouble, and would have to find new ways of making money, i.e., new business models for trading and marketing.

CITI has already restructured, and promised more layoffs in the future, and J.P. Morgan announced substantial job cuts in their equities division on Friday. Dead MarketsJust watch markets lately and one realizes rather fast that more job cuts are on the way, and in a major way all across the spectrum from financial analysts, stock analysts, traders in most products, back office support staff, and management. More Layoffs InevitableI would say that all firms probably need to cut staff by at least 1/3 over the next two years, with current and trending market dynamics in the industry over the last five years, these positions are just not needed today. Frankly, these jobs are dead weight on firms‚Äô balance sheets, and it is amazing how long it has taken firms to reduce staff given the evolution in financial markets. Changing Market DynamicsFirst of all be sorry for what you wish for in Fed induced liquidity taking all the volatility out of markets; and trading profits are sure to decline in trading shops all along the spectrum of products. Next, with the evolution of computer trading and computer driven Algos not only has this reduced volatility, but traders‚Äô jobs in the process. Third, with highly correlated markets and more money flowing into ETFs, stock and commodity differentiation is less relevant than in the past requiring fewer analysts. Fourth, with major consolidation in the industry due to the collapse of Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch this has reduced the overall size of market competition, shrinking volatility further, and reducing overall trading volume. Fifthly, the overall sluggishness of the global economy where many countries have debt problems and are still in the deleveraging phase has severally shrunken GDP growth which hampers private capital infusion into businesses which hurt the IPO and investment banking markets for the financial industry. And finally as the chart of the 10-year note versus the S&amp;P 500 futures contract illustrates asset class differentiation over the last five years has reduced significantly requiring less investment expertise than in the past. All of which is bad for jobs in an industry struggling to redefine itself after the financial crisis. Revive Markets=More Industry JobsIn watching financial markets there are many products which are simply deteriorating before my eyes from¬† a volume, volatility and profitability standpoint, and the more of these markets that pop up each year means that many more job cuts in the industry are on the horizon.¬†¬© EconMatters All Rights Reserved | Facebook | Twitter | Post Alert | Kindle     Read more posts on EconMatters ¬ª
Biases creep into the investment process at two important stages. First, when forming estimates. The starting point (baseline) is key, and rather than using industry dynamics (an outside view), estimates may be influenced by company guidance (vulnerable to vested interests and dated industry dynamics given complex reporting lines), consensus estimates (themselves vulnerable to bias) or an emphasis on well-known newspaper articles. Adding detail to a scenario may make it more memorable, but the detail itself will reduce its likelihood (more is more fallacy). Data may be selected to support a pre-supposed thesis (confirmation bias) and presented as such (positive framing). And expectations may be altered by share price performance on the day of an announcement(causal thinking). Second, biases find their way into the investment decision. Even a bias-free upside calculation may be ignored and over-ridden when the share price is falling (herding with other fearful investors) or the company has been subject to a recent negative press story (recency bias, availability bias). Stocks may be held rather than sold because they‚Äôre in negative territory (loss aversion), the evidence for change doesn‚Äôt seem strong enough (status quo bias) or we think we knew it all along (hindsight bias). Low-growth segments of a business may look attractive when presented by a strong management team (halo effect) and the question ‚Äòis the stock fairly valued‚Äô may be interpreted as ‚Äòdo I like the stock‚Äô when forming the investment case (substitution effect). These biases really matter. Overcoming them and applying systematic rules can enable significant alpha creation, from creating a ‚Äòquality control‚Äô check on additions to a portfolio, to applying a stop-loss when stocks underperform. From bias to error These biases aren‚Äôt just interesting observations. They lead to estimate errors (garbage in, garbage out) and inappropriate stock recommendations. While many errors are analyst-specific, and hidden beneath the surface when aggregated within consensus, some persist from analyst to analyst and quarter to quarter. And we can measure them. We make three key observations: Clustering at mediocrity First, top-line variability is consistently underestimated. Consensus revenue growth forecasts will typically start in the 5%-6% range for the market at large, but the true outcome almost always turns out to be a significantly higher or lower level. While nine of the last ten years‚Äô consensus revenue growth forecasts have been initially in the 5%-6% range, no year saw actual growth within that range. Analysts are reluctant to take a significant view on growth ahead of the date (conservatism, risk aversion), and/or are anchoring to economists who themselves are making the same mistake.  Put another way, over the last decade analysts have typically expected 50% of companies to report sales growth in a 2%-8% range, yet only 23% have actually delivered sales within this range.  Conservative in cash-use Second, analysts will typically underestimate the extent of reinvestment via capex or M&amp;A. Net debt used to fund this reinvestment has been revised upwards in seven of the last ten years, irrespective of the market environment. This may reflect conservatism and a lack of incentive to take a view on lumpy investment. It may also reflect anchoring to company guidance, which itself is disincentivised to announce investment plans early (take a look at the consensus 2013 and 2014 deleveraging assumption. In an environment of ageing assets and rising visibility, are companies really going to buck the trend and de-lever rather than reinvest?).  The wood from the trees Third, analysts will frequently revise estimates post company results, but will less commonly revise estimates in the intervening period. As such, analysts will over-weight information presented by the company, but under-weight data on the broader market (GDP, inflation, unemployment) or the company‚Äôs position within it (pricing power, barriers to entry etc, potentially sourced via primary research). Analysts can miss out on the full picture, or the representative dataset, which can distort estimates.  The consequence... bifurcation underestimation... The demonstrable biases above are probably just the tip of the iceberg. But, each one will have a meaningful impact on long-term earnings estimates, and these will discriminate from company to company. One group of stocks standing to benefit is those with profitable growth opportunities. Company managements will rarely disclose the full extent of future capex plans (conservatism, lack of incentive) and yet their commentary can be disproportionately weighted (manifestation #3 above) and as such the extent of reinvestment and releveraging will be underestimated (manifestation #2). Who cares? All this focus on estimates, but do they really matter? Can‚Äôt we just rely on average estimates but decent models? Unfortunately we can‚Äôt. Just as the conclusions of classical economic theory have been challenged, because the assumption of human rationality is unrealistic, so recommendations taken from inaccurate estimates (irrespective of models) can yield underperformance. To provide an example, buying Stoxx 600 companies on low P/E multiples (and selling high) would have generated c.25% annual alpha over the last decade using 12-month forward actual reported earnings, but would have lost c.3% per annum using consensus estimates. Interestingly, you would lose less money applying historical earnings (-2% alpha pa) than by using consensus estimates.  ¬† Simply put, biases make consensus estimates worthless.
