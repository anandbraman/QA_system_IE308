jujunosh/statigr.amThere's a fine line between calling positive attention to yourself at work and seeming like a braggart. In the business world, you need to learn how to walk this line or risk limiting your chances of success. In her new book "The Essentials Of Business Etiquette," Barbara Pachter offers six suggestion to promoting yourself successfully: "Get involved at your company. Join any company clubs or activities that interest you. Use the work gym, if there is one. Volunteer for assignments. Offer to make presentations, and volunteer to train others." There's a simple reason that being visible is important: If you're at the forefront of your boss' mind, he'll think about you when there's an opening in the company. Visibility also makes you seem available and approachable, meaning you'll have more chances to discuss your accomplishments and responsibilities with others. "A lot of people avoid doing this â€” they say itâ€™s too self-serving. Yet, winning awards is a way for people who know you, but especially those who donâ€™t know you, to find out about your talents. It builds your credibility. And make sure you promote your successes." Many of us were taught to be humble so entering competitions and applying for awards seems like we're telling the world we're great. However, in a professional setting, you do have to tell everyone that you're great or they might never know. "However, be careful not to mention the same accomplishment over and over. You can overdo it and make yourself sound like a braggart. There is a balance. You must speak of other things, not just about what you do well." A trick to this is to thank other people for your award on your social media accounts. This way, you're not announcing your accomplishments outright, even though you're mentioning them by thanking others. "You may find yourself in situations in which you have to introduce yourself. Being prepared will allow you to be comfortable speaking about yourself. Make sure you say your full name and add a few brief comments about yourself." Have your story prepared ahead of time because you'll have to repeatedly tell others this story for the rest of your professional life. Be able to discuss your passions and career goals with confidence. "If someone asks you how you are doing at work, it is your opportunity to mention your accomplishments. Without going into too much detail, tell the person about any recent promotions, new projects, additional responsibilities, and so on." This is also a great time to discuss any new projects or positions you want to try out in the future. This way, you will be remembered if an opportunity does come up. "For example, when I talk in seminars about how men tend to interrupt more than women during meetings, I mention comments from my seminar participants in Oman, in the Middle East. These remarks add to the discussion, and they also highlight my international experience." Always start small and subtle when weaving your accomplishments into conversations. You can ask your boss for help or seek advice from others. This way, you're letting them know what you're working on without actually screaming that you're a superstar.
Meanwhile, another source said JPMorgan is close to reaching a settlement with securities regulators over the trading loss. The trader, Bruno Iksil, who worked in JPMorgan's chief investment office in London and incurred losses on oversized positions in a derivatives market, is cooperating with government investigators, the source said. The Federal Bureau of Investigation in New York and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, along with regulators in the UK, opened probes last year into the activity surrounding the costly bets, which earned Iksil the nickname "the London Whale" from fellow Wall Street traders. The case is still open, but JPMorgan is close to a deal with the SEC that will require the bank to pay a penalty and admit faults, according to a person familiar with the matter. While the company has apologized repeatedly for the debacle and described short-comings in its risk controls, the source was not clear on exactly what the bank will have to admit to settle the matter. The settlement is expected to be completed by the end of the year. It was first reported by The New York Times on Thursday. The fate of a potential criminal case against JPMorgan or other individuals who worked for the bank during the incident remains unclear. Spokesmen for the FBI and the SEC declined to comment. A spokeswoman for JPMorgan did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokeswoman for Preet Bharara, the U.S. attorney for Manhattan, declined to comment. Iksil's lawyer also declined to comment. In March, a U.S. Senate committee reported findings from its own investigation, concluding that JPMorgan ignored risks, misled investors, fought with regulators and tried to work around rules as it dealt with mushrooming losses in the portfolio for which Iksil was trading. Emails from Iksil to superiors that were later made public in conjunction with the Senate report show he tried to exit the positions he had taken once he realized he was being squeezed by traders taking the opposing positions in the small, illiquid market. "The guys have a huge skew trade on and they will defend it as much as we do," Iksil wrote in a January 30, 2012, email to a supervisor. "I think I should take the pain fast over the next month....It is pointless in my view to go for a fight....I have to let it go." Even so, Iksil continued to add to his trading positions for weeks afterward; his office did not begin to unwind the positions until early April, when information about JPMorgan's trades became public. Iksil, who worked in London but is French and lives with his family in Paris, was fired from JPMorgan along with two supervisors last year in the wake of the scandal.

AlthoughÂ Kosta Kartsotis is the CEO of Fossil Group, a public company with a $7 billion valuation, hardly anyone knows what he looks like.  Kartsotis refuses to share any photos of himself and he won't let his company publish or share an executive shot either, reports Bloomberg's Jordan Robertson. He's not on Twitter, hasn't appeared in a YouTube, and if this really is his LinkedIn profile, it's a photo-less bare bones thing. The company's PR team even declined to send a photo when Bloomberg wanted to feature Kartsotis in an article, Robertson reports. In addition to being camera shy, he's also not greedy. While many a CEO takes $1 salary, Kartsotis has taken no salary since at least 2008. And the company, which makes high-fashion watches and jewelry, doesnâ€™t pay dividends, Bloomberg reports. His net worth is reliant on how well his company's stock performs. That might want to make you shake his hand the the next time you see him. Unfortunately, you probably won't recognize him.
Wikimedia CommonsShiva, destroyer of all that is inferior.With stock prices near all-time highs, investors have grown increasingly uncomfortable about where the markets may head in the near-term. Perhaps the better idea is to think long-term. In a new report titled, "The Search for Creative Destruction," the analysts at Goldman Sachs do just that. "We showcase eight secular disruptive themes that we believe possess the potential to command greater attention in the coming years," wrote lead analyst Robert Boroujerdi. "Indeed, these stories through product or business innovation are poised to transform addressable markets or open up entirely new ones, offering growth insulated from the broader macro environment and creating value for their stakeholders, in our view." Goldman's themes cut across all industries from manufacturing to finance to tobacco. We've put together the most important data within each "destroyer," describing what it does and quantifying its growth potential.

For more visit Business Insider's new Wealth Advisor vertical. 5 Signs Your Advisor Is A Financial Zombie (Marketwatch) Marketwatch's Brett Arrends tells investors there are many financial zombies on Wall Street. He writes that investors can be sure their advisor is a financial zombie if they utter these five things we often hear bandied about by pundits on television. 1. "...Cash on sidelines... market going higher. â€¦No money has 'come into' the market at all. This is a matter of simple logic, yet the cash-on-the-sidelines mantra refuses to die." 2. "...Great rotation coming... out of bonds... into stocks." 3. "Households in good shapeâ€¦debt trouble over." Debts are still at 2006 levels argues Arrends. 4. "...Corporate balance sheets so greatâ€¦." 5. "Stocks... will... earn... 9% a year." Bill Gross: Here's How To Adapt In The Upcoming Bond War (PIMCO) The bond wars are coming writes Bill Gross in his new investment outlook. And bonds like other investments have "weapons" that can be used "to defend against higher interest rates." These weapons are "carry" which comes in the form of maturity extension, but also other forms of carry that "not necessarily yield or interest rate dependent." Bonds also have carry in the form of maturity risk, credit risk, volatility risk, curve risk, and currency risk.Â  "Bonds issued by less than Aaa sovereign countries and all corporations have a credit spread that can provide a significant or even higher risk-adjusted carry than does maturity extension. These spreads might widen as interest rates rise, but historically they have not, acting as a diversifier rather than a bear market enhancer. Bonds also have a volatility premium that produces carry, a premium more susceptible to negative consequences if yields rise suddenly like May/June but not during a more gradual increase like one that PIMCO forecasts over the next few years. In addition, bonds have a carry component inherent in the yield curve itself, one which refers to choices between a bullet or a barbell strategy â€“ the bullet providing historically more carry than the barbell under most market conditions. And a bond can be denominated in non-dollar currencies, all of which provide the potential at some point to enhance carry." "â€¦Capitalism depends on the successful offering and capture of carry in its multiple forms. If capitalism is faltering (recession) in developed/developing economies and yields are close to the zero bound, then portfolios should have less carry than before. If prospects are mediocre, portfolios should be overweight carry. If prospects are very bright, they should again be underweight bond carry. If we can be mindful of this, and accurately forecast it, we will be successful." JEREMY GRANTHAM: Don't Try To Pretend Like The Fed's Next Move Matters (Bloomberg Businessweek)  GMO's Jeremy Grantham is a legendary long-term investor. This is why he isn't worried about the Fed taper. In an interview with Businessweek, when asked if the Fed can take taper without shocking the markets he replied: "Who cares? This is the game Iâ€™m complaining about. We will prosper by the quality and quantity of our labor and capital. Do not pretend that how they twitch around has any material effect." SEC Commissioner Says New Custody Rules Won'tÂ  Hurt Brokers (Investment News) New rules approved by the SEC require brokers that control their clients' money to file a quarterly Form Custody with information on the amount and location of the funds. They also have to file an annual compliance report. The idea is that this will help curtail Ponzi schemes, though some have complained about the costs to broker-dealers. "Any well-run operation should be able to implement the rules without difficulty," SEC Commissioner Luis Aguilar told Investment News in an interview.Â  "Investors need to have confidence that the assets they hand over to broker-dealers will be protected. Without such confidence, investors are likely to stay out of the markets, which isnâ€™t good for the economy."

Google Images&gt;Detroit emergency manager Kevyn Orr is trying to come up with ways to plug the city's estimated $18.5 billion debt problem. So this week, he announced he had engaged Christie's to appraise the city's art collection.Â  The move has generated controversy â€” both from those who say the collection should remain untouchable, and from camps who believe the city should never have owned the works in the first place. Unusual among major cities, Detroit owns the entire collection at the Detroit Institute of Arts. The Detroit Free Press reached out to art dealers in May to provide a rough estimate of the collection's overall value. The group came up with a final tally of at least $2.5 billion.Â  We wanted to dig into the collection to get a better sense of what the city could end up losing.
REUTERS/Jim YoungIn the past five years passive investing and indexing have outperformed active investing. Charles Schwab appears to be capitalizing on this hot investment trend. Schwab has unveiled six new Schwab Fundamental Index ETFs will begin trading next week. These ETFs will track the Russell Fundamental Index Series. Market-cap weighted indexes are often criticized for focusing on popular stocks. The argument for fundamentally weighted strategies is that they are more objective and draw on fundamentals like adjusted sales, cash flow and so on. First a quick look at the six ETFs that will be available to investors commission-free, online in Schwab accounts starting August 15. "These ETFs add a new flavor to our ‘pure vanilla’ ETF market-cap line-up and further demonstrate our commitment to offering core products that help investors build their portfolios and potentially achieve better outcomes," Marie Chandoha, president of Charles Schwab Investment Management (CSIM) said in a press release. The ETFs will be added to Schwab ETF OneSource platform.

This morning Bill Ackman announced that he would be looking for a new CEO for JC Penny. As a result, the stock shot up. Unfortunately, now it seems like the rest of the company's board feels that Ackman, who owns 17.74% of the retailer, spoke too soon. Bloomberg reports that the rest of the board does not agree with Ackman's decision to fire CEO Mike Ullman after just 4 months, and that they're pushing back. "His latest actions are disruptive and counterproductive at an important stage in the Company's recovery," said the rest of the board in their statment. Here's the full statement from JC Penney's board (emphasis ours): Plano, Texas (August 8, 2013) - Thomas Engibous, Chairman of the Board of Directors of J. C. Penney Company, Inc. (JCP), today responded to the public disclosure of a letter to the Board of Directors from William Ackman, head of the investment firm Pershing Square Capital Management, L.P. and a J. C. Penney director.On behalf of the Board of Directors, Mr. Engibous said, "The Company has made significant progress since Myron E. (Mike) Ullman, III returned as CEO four months ago, under unusually difficult circumstances. Since then, Mike has led significant actions to correct the errors of previous management and to return the Company to sustainable, profitable growth." Mr. Engibous noted that this includes critical work to stabilize the organization, improve the Company's financial position, bring inventory back to appropriate levels across all businesses, restore successful private brands - notably in time for back-to-school - address issues in the Home business, make the stores easier to shop, and reintegrate the online business with stores. "Mike is the right person to rebuild jcpenney by stabilizing its operations, restoring confidence among our vendors, and getting customers back in our stores. He has the overwhelming support of the Board of Directors, and we are confident the Company is in good hands." Mr. Engibous continued, "When Mike returned, it was understood that there would be an effort to rebuild the management team, including a search process to identify his successor. The CEO search process, which began in earnest three weeks ago, will be careful and deliberate to ensure we find the right long-term leader for jcpenney. In the meantime, Mike and the leadership team will continue the work under way to improve the Company's performance and get back on a path to profitable growth." Mr. Engibous concluded, "The Board of Directors strongly disagrees with Mr. Ackman and is extremely disappointed that his letter was released to the media at the same time that it was sent to the Board. Mr. Ackman has been integrally involved in the Board's activities since he joined two years ago. This includes leading a campaign to appoint the Company's previous CEO, under whose leadership performance deteriorated precipitously. His latest actions are disruptive and counterproductive at an important stage in the Company's recovery."

BCV, BofA Merrill Lynch Global ResearchA lot of countries hold gold as a portion of their foreign reserves. According to BofA Merrill Lynch economist Francisco Rodriguez, Venezuela's central bank holds 72% of its reserves in the form of monetary gold â€“ an asset that has lost 27.2% of its value already in 2013. "Venezuelaâ€™s international reserves have fallen 23% [year-to-date] to their lowest level since 2004," writes Rodriguez in a note to clients. "A close look at the data reveals that almost the totality of the decline in reserves can be explained by gold prices falling from their peak in [the third quarter of 2012]." Rodriguez writes: Reverse Midas  Seventy-two percent of Venezuelaâ€™s central bank reserves are held in the form of monetary gold. The central bank values these holdings at the six-month moving average of the London fixing price for gold. An effect of the moving average valuation is that the full effect of price movements is incorporated into the data with a lag. This explains, for example, why gold reserves fell 7.4% since the end of June even as gold prices were recovering (Chart 4).  Valued at market prices, gold reserves have fallen $4.2bn ytd and $5.5bn from their September 2012 peak. Not all of this decline has been incorporated into the reserves figure reported by the central bank due to the smoothing effect of the moving average formula. If gold remains at its current price, we can expect reserves to decline by an additional $1.1bn due to this effect.  Non-gold reserves now stand at $6.4bn. Of this, $3.9bn are SDRs and net credit positions before the IMF, leaving $2.6bn of FX holdings, 70% of which is in liquid instruments. The $2.6bn of reserves ex-gold and IMF may appear low compared to December ($6.0bn) or June ($4.2bn), but that largely reflects seasonal factors associated to PDVSA transfers to the central bank at the end of every semester. The current level is only moderately lower than the $3.2bn August 2012 level. "Our baseline scenario actually contains a slight improvement in the total value of cash holdings, as our commodities team expects the price of gold to recover and reach $1495/oz by year-end," says Rodriguez. "We expect the total value of public sector FX holdings to stabilize through year-end at $54.4bn, a similar level to that of 2012 ($54.0bn), even as total reserves end the year at around $23.2bn, $6.6bn lower than at the end of 2012."

Brazilians are probably blasting the celebratory samba music after last night's rosy Chinese trade numbers (if you believe in that sort of thing). Some of the country'sÂ  most important stocks are up on the news after months of misery. To review: China reported that exports jumped 5.1% year-over-year â€” stronger than the 2.0% economists expected â€” and imports surged 10.9%, surging past expectations for 1.0% growth. That means relief for Brazil, whose stock market, Sao Paolo's Ibovespa, has fallen 24% year to date. The almost 300 publicly traded stocks in Brazil have lost $203 billion year to date. This weekend, one of the country's former Central Bank Presidents, Arminio Fraga, said that decline was, in part, due to weakened Chinese demand for Brazilian raw materials. And today, on all that China trade number positivity, the Ibovespa has gained 4.4%. The iShares MSCI Brazil Index Fund (EWZ) â€” an ETF â€” that was getting pummeled earlier this summer during protests is rallying too. It's up 3.5% Over a quarter of EWZ's weight is made up by two stocks â€” Vale,Â  a mining company that sells a lot of iron ore to China, and Petrobras, the state oil and gas company. Both are rallying today up over 4.5%. Now you may be saying to yourself â€” 4%... who cares? To put in perspective, both companies have had miserable 2013s. Petrobras is still down 31% year to date, and Vale is down 34% year to date. So every little bit helps.
Steve Marcus/ReutersPoker buffs have long argued that their game is one of skill, not luck.  Even a district judge agreed last year, letting a man who organized Texas Hold 'Em games in a Staten Island warehouse off the hook. Poker, unlike lesser games, didn't really violate anti-gambling laws, the judge concluded. This week the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York disagreed, reversing the decision. From Forbes: “The ‘game of skill’ argument to support the legality of poker was a lie perpetrated by Online Poker companies to deceive consumers into depositing money on their gambling Internet sites,” said [Gambling Law attorney Mark] Lavery to FORBES.  ”I think this decision renders the skill argument a dead letter for loophole gambling like online poker and the so-called emerging ‘Daily Fantasy Sports’ craze.  This ruling should not have an Impact on the Internet Poker Freedom Act.  That bill tries to legalize what is illegal gambling in almost all states —  online poker.” Essentially, the court ruled that the whole "luck vs. skill" argument is immaterial. Poker is still gambling under New York state law and federal statutes. 
This just in from CNBC's Twitter account via Reuters. After getting publicly accused of a crime by hedge-fund manager Bill Ackman last week, George Soros is yanking all of his money out of Bill Ackman's hedge fund. Last Wednesday, CNBC's Scott Wapner reported that Soros had amassed a large long position in Herbalife.  The stock surged on the news. Herbalife, a multi-level marketing firm that sells nutrition products, is the stock that Ackman's $12 billion Pershing Square Capital Management is short.   Late last year, Ackman publicly revealed that he's shorting more than 20 million shares with a price target of $0.  Ackman believes the company is a "pyramid scheme" and that regulators will be persuaded to investigate it.  Not everyone has agreed with him and Herbalife has become the focal point of an epic clash of hedge fund billionaires.  Ackman's big rival, billionaire investor Carl Icahn, purchased a massive stake in the company and said that he thinks Ackman will be the victim of the "mother of all short squeezes."  Soros' family office hedge fund is just the most recent investor to snap up a long position. Also, Soros works in the same building as Ackman at 888 Seventh Avenue.
The analysts at Goldman Sachs just presented their  list of eight technologies that will reshape how we do business in the coming years. To illustrate how fast new innovations can come on the scene and wipe out enterprises, they offer the following startling statistic: of the firms listed on the NASDAQ 100 as of 2001, just 31% remain today. "In our view, the higher turnover of NDX constituents is marked by the predominance of technology-driven names on this index," the write. "In Exhibit 2, we review the change in index composition at three-year intervals since the start of 2001 through now. While we acknowledge this exercise is somewhat simplistic, as it focuses only on publicly traded companies and does not account for M&amp;A activity, we believe it serves as a useful proxy with which to assess change." There remain just 56% of 2001-listed firms on the S&amp;P500, they add.Goldman Sachs, Business Insider
The area of land used for producing cocaine in Colombia has fallen to its lowest level since experts started tracking the numbers, Bloomberg reports. In 2012 the amount of land used fell 25%. The country has been using manual and aerial spraying to eradicate coca bushes per a Clinton Administration counter-narcotics program called Plan Colombia. This is all in a report by the United Nation's Office of Drugs and Crime. Check out more details in their release below: 8 August 2013 - The area under coca crop cultivation in Colombia fell by a quarter in 2012 to 48,000 hectares (ha), down from 6 4,000 ha in 2011. This was the national picture at the end of 2012.A survey jointly conducted by the Government of Colombia and UNODC shows that coca bush cultivation affected 23 of the country's 32 departments; decreased in 17 departments; increased in the 3 departments of Norte de Santander, CaquetÃ¡ and ChocÃ³; and remained unchanged in the remaining 3. Satellite images and field surveys showed that some 80 per cent of cultivation was concentrated in 8 departments, with roughly half taking place in 3 of those departments. NariÃ±o, Putumayo, Guaviare and Cauca saw the greatest declines and 7 departments are now below the 100-hectare level. The Government manually eradicated almost 30, 500 ha of coca bushes in 2012 and sprayed nearly 100,550 ha of coca crops from the air, similar to 2011 levels. These efforts thus curbed the area affected by coca cultivation in 2012 from 135,000 ha to 48,000 ha by the end of the year. The farm-gate value of coca leaf and derivatives (coca paste, cocaine base) in 2012 was estimated at US$ 370 million, down from the 2011 value of US$422 million, and worth 0.2 per cent of national GDP and 3 per cent of the GDP related to the agricultural sector. In contrast, prices remained stable for cocaine base (+3.9 per cent), paste (-0.4 per cent), and chlorhydrate (-2.4 per cent). Recent studies show that the coca leaf yield per hectare has decreased. The number of households involved in coca cultivation fell 3 per cent from 62,400 in 2011 to 60,600 in 2012. Annual yields of coca leaf have been decreasing since 2005 but the market price has picked up almost 10 per cent. The production of 100 per cent pure cocaine ranged from between 240 and 377 tons. Since estimates are uncertain, the 2012 figure may be calculated at 309 tons, which is comparable to the 2011 figure. Cocaine seizures of unknown purity rose 21 per cent from some 156 metric tons in 2011 to around 188 tons in 2012. With the average gross income of a farmer selling coca leaf is estimated at USD $1, 220 per year, coca production does not fetch the same lucrative rewards as in the past; in 2005, 82 per cent of coca growers were dependent on the crop and its derivatives, whereas the latest survey points to some 60 per cent of farmers - 30 per cent fewer - considering coca-related activities as their mainstay. Some 30 per cent of farmers are currently involved in the conversion of coca leaf into base cocaine, half the 2005 figure. "The impact of the government efforts to eradicate illicit coca crop is visible. However, the 2012 and previous surveys show that after eradication takes place, cultivation often resumes in new or previously cleared fields. Therefore, crop eradication, even when it yields positive results, must be complemented by alternative livelihood schemes to improve social, economic and environmental conditions and to achieve a sustainable reduction in the area under cultivation" said Bo Mathiasen, UNODC Representative in Colombia. In 2012, investments of almost US$250 million were made in the framework of the Policy of Territorial Consolidation to tackle the factors making territories vulnerable to coca cultivation while promoting development, notably in the provinces of NariÃ±o, Antioquia, Putumayo, Huila and Cauca.

flickr/Adam SelwoodGluskin Sheff's David Rosenberg has joined the "peak oil is dead" caravan. In a note this morning, Rosenberg echoes what others have been saying this year: that demand for crude oil is slowly but surely being destroyed by the rise of natural gas, improving efficiency standards and increased environmental awareness in emerging markets. As a result, the cost of producing goods — and the price paid to transport them and pick them up a store — is going to fall, he says:   A substantially lower energy price environment is singularly the most bullish underpinning to the global cost curve and real purchasing power (the U.S. in particular), which is very constructive for capital goods industries that are highly energy intensive, not to mention the positive impact on disposable incomes (and cyclical consumer spending as a result) There is evidence that this effect is not as big as Rosenberg makes it out to be, at least for now. Goldman's Jan Hatzius and Deutsche Bank's Peter Hooper both have said the net benefit of reduced energy costs in energy-intensive industries, and thus the knock-on effect for the broader economy, may be limited. But it's hard to argue we're not heading in the right direction.
Last night on MSNBC, Ezra Klein and I debated whether New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg was out of line when he suggested New York risked a Detroit-like decline if his successor implemented the wrong policies. I actually think Bloomberg was onto something. Here's the video:  Visit NBCNews.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy Ordinarily, I think these kinds of comparisons are off-base. But New York is, in one very important way, like Detroit: Its economy is dominated by one industry, and it doesn't have a good repositioning plan in place for when that industry falters. New York has the highest taxes in the U.S., providing very generous pension and health care benefits to public workers that now consume 1/5 of the city's budget, with a vast social services apparatus that in most other places would be left to the state government to manage. And that all works because Wall Street is a money machine. Bankers make way more money here than they could make if they moved their businesses elsewhere, and they love living here, so they will put up with high taxes, high rents, and all the other aspects of New York that make life here expensive. And they really do pay the city's bills. In 2008, 44% of wages earned in New York City went to people working in the finance and insurance sector; even in the depth of the financial crisis, that share only declined to 37%. Those figures actually understate finance's importance to the city's tax base — after all, who's hiring high-paid lawyers and going out to fancy restaurants and buying apartments in luxury towers that construction workers build? Bankers. In fact, these huge salaries and profits are what saved New York from its last great fiscal crisis, which we experienced when, like in Detroit, our economic and population base shrank to a point where they could no longer support the city's financial commitments. New York was once America's greatest manufacturing hub. All the charming old buildings that hipsters are colonizing in western Brooklyn (and, 25 years ago, in SoHo) used to be industrial. New York City made heady financial commitments on the back of that industrial base, including some agreements with public employee unions that would later prove to be very unwise. And as that industrial economic base and the city's population declined, New York City found itself unable to meet its financial commitments. In the 1960s, the city started depending on short-term borrowing to make its books balance. Eventually, the bond markets decided that the city was in over its head, and bankruptcy became a real risk. In 1975, it took a rescue from the government of New York State to save the city from insolvency. While fiscal rectitude played a key role in righting the city's finances in the 1980s, the really important story was the very good fortunes in its largest economic sector. Finance doubled as a share of the U.S. economy over the last 30 years, and many of the big banker salaries and big bank profits that came along with that are taxed in New York City. Another money spigot started up under New York City at the exact time we needed it. Of course, automaking was once a money spigot for Detroit, too. The question for New York is, what happens if banking declines? There's good reason to think that's a risk over the long term. The financialization of the U.S. economy has produced great things for New York, but it's not clear the country as a whole is benefiting. The vast expansion of finance does not appear to have boosted innovation or GDP growth. New York should be worried about public policies that would aim to reduce finance to the role it played in the economy before 1980. That's why Bloomberg's message this week about what the next mayor must do to prevent risk of a fiscal crisis had two prongs. One was getting pension and health care commitments to public employees under control, in case the city's tax base can no longer support the current largesse. The other was diversifying New York's economy, so that the city is less dependent on the financial sector. Bloomberg has taken some steps in this direction, including drawing a new science and technology-focused university campus to Roosevelt Island. He's also pushing, as his last major initiative, an upzoning of the area of Midtown right around Grand Central Station that would allow even more skyscrapers in an already-dense area of Manhattan. Adding more supply would help non-financial firms compete with the banks that bid up prime Manhattan office rents. If the financial sector starts to shrink, New York's cost problem will partly fix itself, as office and residential rents will decline. But the related decline in real estate values would be hugely disruptive to the economy even as it lowers the cost of doing business. And other legacy costs in New York, like servicing the pensions on which the city spends 17 times as much as it did 13 years ago, won't decline unless policymakers actively choose to push costs down. Detroit's problem was that it didn't have a plan for life after automaking, and didn't have a strategy for making the city attractive to firms that might come into replace lost manufacturing jobs. New York needs a strategy for life after banking, and part of that strategy has to involve being less outlandishly expensive. That's the reason it was reasonable for Bloomberg to invoke Detroit, even though municipal insolvency isn't on the horizon.
Private equity goddess Lynn Tilton, the founder of Patriarch Partners, is featured in Bloomberg Businessweek's interview edition.  As part of her job, Tilton—who is known for wearing tight and short Gucci and Cavalli dresses paired with dominatrix-like high heels—spends time with Saudis doing business deals.   Apparently one of the Saudis suggested that she run for President of the United States.   From BW:  Do you handle the sales?I deliver a lot of helicopters. I delivered the helicopter to the president of Costa Rica. I will do a big ceremony for the prime minister of Kurdistan. I have met with the king of Jordan multiple times. What do they make of you in Saudi Arabia? Do they ask you to wear a head scarf?In Saudi Arabia, one dresses as the Saudis do. But I meet with Saudis here and in Dubai. The generals from Saudi Arabia were here, and we were all eating burgers and fries and salads, and one general asked me to run for president of the United States. What was your response?I said I have 75 companies and 120,000 people that need me. Maybe someday.... There you have it folks. Maybe one day. 
Flickr/USFWSHQBloomberg Businessweek's second annual "interview issue" hits newsstands Friday, offering Q&amp;As with bigwigs like Bill Gates, Barbara Walters, Rand Paul, and the Winklevoss twins. But the best tidbit from the issue comes from this bizarre exchange with UPS CEO Scott Davis. From Businessweek: Have you shipped live sharks?Yeah. We probably ship a little bit of everything, whales, you name it. Weâ€™ve got to be able to handle any precious commodity, and health care is obviously the area weâ€™re moving into. So while weâ€™re doing sharks and lobsters and whales, at the same time people are waiting on the operating table for some things that weâ€™ve got to get to them. Isnâ€™t that dangerous, shipping live sharks?It can be. Youâ€™ve got to have experts help you. How do you ship a live whale?Itâ€™s a big container. This has been a banner week for sharks.
AP According to the latest World Bank data, Nigeria had a population ofÂ 168,833,776 in 2012, compared with a population ofÂ 313,914,040 in the United States. In 30 years, the world will likely look very different. "Secular population trends still favor Emerging Markets, as working population growth in Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa will easily outpace growth in the West," says BofA Merrill Lynch chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett. "Demographic trends in Africa are of particular note with the population of Nigeria set to overtake that of Indonesiaâ€™s by 2034, and the US population in 2045." BofA Merrill Lynch Global Investment Strategy, Haver Labor force demographics also arguably favor emerging markets vis-a-vis the West. The charts below from ISI show forecasts for how the labor forces in both the emerging and the developed world are likely to evolve. "The more developed country total labor force will soon begin to shrink at an accelerating rate for many albeit not all developed countries," writes ISI lead analyst and head of global demographics research Dick Hokenson in a recent report. "This implies slower real GDP growth unless productivity increases at a faster rate." ILO, ISI "Although the less developed country total labor force will essentially comprise all of the net growth in the worldâ€™s labor force," says Hokenson, "the rate of increase slows from 1.86% per year from 2000-2010 to 1.43% per year this decade."

Tesla was up 15% to $154.81 earlier today. Tesla is now up 17.6% to $157.87. Shares surged after-hours on Wednesday after Tesla's Q2 earnings report beat expectations. The company reported Q2 profit of $0.20 per share, on revenue of $405 million. This beat expectations for a loss of $0.19 per share, on revenue of $387.9 million. Goldman Sach's Patrick Archambault has since raised his six-month price target to $95 from $84. But he thinks at today's price, the stock is expensive, even in their most optimistic scenario. Here's a look at Tesla's intra-day chart: Google Finance
TumblrOn Wall Street, you work long hours, so a coffee addiction is almost inescapable. It's not just that you need that caffeine, it's that it's a part of the job's culture. When you start out as a young analyst, the boring hours between spreadsheets and pitch books are spent going on Starbucks runs. Unless you can get the interns to go get it, of course. Our love of coffee noted, it's very possible to drink too much coffee, and that can be harmful to your body. Research shows that ingesting too much caffeine (500-600 milligrams or 5 or more cups of coffee) can cause anything from restlessness to muscle tremors. So keep all this in mind when you order your next double shot of espresso.
U.S. private equity firms' fundraising volume rose to $42 billion last quarter, a 147% jump from the first quarter of 2013. The level was the highest since March 2009. After a slow first quarter, portfolio company sales (or "exits") doubled from Q1 to Q2, to $42 billion as well. Last month, a report from Preqin summed up the Q2 results: Private equity fundraising was very strong in Q2 2013, with the highest quarterly value raised since the onset of the financial crisis in late 2008. The fact that the average size of private equity funds closed in Q2 2013 was $800mn and experienced managers dominated the fundraising environment, shows that investors are increasingly looking to back fund managers with a demonstrable track record. And these charts, viaÂ the Private Equity Growth Capital Council, show the state of the industry. PEGCC PEGCC PEGCC PEGCC PEGCC PEGCC
Reuters/ Shannon Stapelton Hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, the CEO of Pershing Square Capital ManagementCNBC's Scott Wapner reports that JCPenney is looking for a new CEO to replace interim chief executive Mike Ullman, according to letter from hedge fund manager Bill Ackman.  Ullman took over the helm again after Ron Johnson stepped down back in April. What's more is Ackman writes that Allen Questrom, the former JCPenney CEO who was one of Johnson's most vocal critics, might be returning to the board as chairman if he approves of the new CEO, according to Wapner. Ackman is the largest shareholder in JCPenney and he has a seat on the retailer's board.  His $12 billion Pershing Square Capital Management owns a 17.74% stake in JCPenney, according to the latest 13F regulatory filing for the fund. Ackman, who has been a big cheerleader for the struggling retailer over the past couple of years, has taken a bath on the stock so far.  Shares of JCPenney are trading up more than 9% on that news.  Here's the chart:  Yahoo!

ReutersMulally is the second from the left.China has become an area of tremendous potential for companies as the nominally communist country has embraced capitalism. The hybrid result, according to Ford CEO Alan Mulally, is in some ways an improvement on what's been a pretty sluggish and inefficient democratic process elsewhere in the world. In a Q&amp;A with Keith Naughton and Craig Trudell for Bloomberg Businessweek's interview issue, Mulally is effusive in his praise for the party and the government in China, where Ford's sales are up massively. Asked if they're easier to work with than democracies, Mullaly replied: "They are a pleasure to work with. You’re welcomed, you’re part of the fabric. 'What can we do to help? What can we do to work together?' There’s nothing like it in the world." When questioned about the odd dichotomy between communism and full-throated capitalism, Mulally adds: "It’s fantastic. The working relationship between the party and the government is tight. They both have the same objective, to grow the economy." The obvious contrast is with Ford's home in the United States, where politics and the government frequently serve as an impediment, rather than an economic booster, especially from the viewpoint of business. The tenor of his answers might be colored by his need to maintain good relations with China's ruling elite. Mulally's relationship with the country goes back a long way. In the interview, he describes taking a lead role in China in the '70s and '80s during his time at Boeing. The country became a key part of his strategy at Ford from the beginning, and the business has been increasingly successful. Other companies haven't had as positive an experience. KFC saw sales plummet massively after a government investigation into its supply chain. And British drug-maker GlaxoSmithKline is embroiled in a bribery controversy and investigation. It's great to be a favored partner, but awful to be in the government's bad graces.
We're glad you're back and doing great, Mr. Gecko. But how about something for the rest of us???As I've explained before, one big reason U.S. economic growth is so crappy these days is that big American companies are hoarding cash and "maximizing profits" instead of investing in their people and future projects. This is contributing to record income inequality and starving the primary engine of U.S. economic growth â€” the vast American middle class â€” of purchasing power. (See charts below). If average Americans don't get paid living wages, they can't can't buy many products and services. And when average Americans can't buy products and services, the companies that sell products and services can't grow. So the profit obsession of America's big companies is, ironically, hurting their ability to grow. One obvious solution to this is for big companies to pay people more â€” to share more of the vast wealth that they create with the people who create it. Another is for the companies to invest more in future projects. The companies have record profit margins, so they can certainly afford to do this. But, unfortunately, over the past three decades, what began as a healthy and necessary effort to make our companies more efficient has evolved into a warped consensus that the only value that companies create is financial (cash) and that the only thing managers and owners should ever worry about is making more of it. This view is an insult to anyone who has ever wanted to work for something more than money. And it is a short-sighted and destructive view of capitalism, an economic system that sustains not just this country but most countries in the world. It's no mystery where this consensus is coming from, though: Wall Street. Economic Policy InstituteAlmost all of America's income gains over the last three decades have gone to the "owners."Over the past three decades, Wall Street's asset-management industry has become ever more lucrative and professionalized. As this has happened, many of the country's most promising business executives have "followed the money" to Wall Street, where they become investors and seek to add value (and enrich themselves) by reminding the people who make America's products and services who they work for and what is expected of them. In the asset-management business, the quality of the "product" is judged only by one simple measure--the financial return. So with so many talented, ambitious, and smart people flooding into the industry, it's no surprise that America's big companies have been heckled, berated, threatened, and incented until their managers view their teammates as "costs" and come to care about only one thing: The bottom line. To make sure senior managers obsess about financial value over the other kinds of value that great companies create--value for customers and employees--Wall Street's asset managers have also learned to compensate the senior managers with big helpings of stock. This way, the senior managers are also incented to view rank-and-file employees as "costs" and minimize them in order to deliver the highest possible return. And woe to to the CEO or senior management team that dares to share the value a company creates with the folks who create it (the employees)! An "activist" investor will immediately attack the company, get the CEO and senior managers fired, and install a management team that knows that job number one is to kiss the Wall Street ring. Business Insider, St. Louis FedAmerica's big companies are more profitable than they have ever been.Now, in defense of Wall Street, this behavior is understandable. Wall Street executives, like other professionals, want to do a good job. It's just that what doing a "good job" as an asset manager means these days is dumping or attacking companies that balance and share the value they create with all of their constituencies (customers, employees, and shareholders) and buy the ones that steer every penny possible into the pockets of the shareholders. Wall Street, in other words, is just doing what it is ordering every big American company to do: "Maximize earnings." In the process, however, it is destroying the health of the American economy by treating hundreds of millions of Americans as "costs" and keeping a staggering percentage of the country's wealth for itself. Business Insider, St. Louis FedThe same companies, meanwhile, are paying the lowest wages in history.And, as previously noted, Wall Street is also sacrificing long-term returns in the service of its short-term greed. If some of those quarterly profits that Wall Street insists be "maximized" were instead invested in paying existing employees more, hiring new employees, and investing in other promising projects, the future growth of the companies Wall Street owns would almost certainly accelerate. And this, in turn, would produce higher long-term profits and make Wall Street even richer. In short, in the ever-present tension between "labor" and "capital," capital has Â won. The Wall Street industrial complex has done its job so well--so much of the wealth of America's big corporations is being devoted to enriching shareholders--that tens of millions of hard-working fully-employed Americans are living in poverty. And tens of millions of other Americans aren't working at all--casualties of the "maximized profits" and lack of investment that Wall Street so aggressively insists on. Business Insider, St. Louis Fed, Bureau of Labor StatisticsAs a result, the share of America's income that is going to the people who make the products and services ("labor") is plummeting. Wall Street investors, meanwhile, have never had it so good.Importantly, if big American companies were struggling to make money, or were making only average profits, there would be no need to have this conversation. But they aren't. America's big companies are currently generating the highest profit margins in history. Meanwhile, they are paying the lowest wages in history. The solution to this problem is not to make companies pay out all of their earnings to their employees. Shareholders deserve a cut, too. The solution is merely to get companies to balance the interests of their shareholders, customers, and employees--to take some of their profits and re-invest them in people and future projects. Importantly, in doing this, Wall Street and America's senior managers would not so much be sharing their wealth as "reinvesting" it. Â Any cash that America's big companies spend instead of hoarding (or buying back stock) will become revenue for other companies. And this revenue, in turn, will accelerate the growth of most American companies. Business Insider, St. Louis FedAnd, of course, America's big companies have cut so many "costs," that fewer Americans are working than any time in the past three decades.(And for those managers and owners who just can't stomach the idea of sharing their wealth with the people who generate it, there is another option, too: Just cut prices. If companies reduce the prices for their products and services, they will make them more affordable for customers, a.k.a., normal Americans. And for these customers, a penny saved is a penny earned.) So that's the solution to America's economic woes. It is persuading (or, if necessary, forcing) Wall Street and America's senior managers to better balance the interests of customers, shareholders, and employees--and, in so doing, share more of the vast wealth of America's big companies with the people who generate it. Business Insider, St. Louis FedIn short, the problem is this. America's big companies have the highest profits in history...and are sharing a record-low amount with their employees.These employees, after all, are consumers. And unlike most Wall Street investors and senior managers, who make more money than they know what to do with, these consumers will turn around and spend every penny that they earn. So, come on, Wall Street! Give America a raise! In short, here's the solution to our economic woes: Lower profits. Higher wages. Business Insider, St. Louis Fed
CPSL via VimeoGMO's Jeremy GranthamGMO's Jeremy Grantham is one of the most successful investing minds in history. His focus is on the long-term, which is why he is concerned about things like climate change. And this is why he's not too worried about when the Fed may begin to taper its stimulative asset purchase program and tighten monetary policy. From an interview with BloombergBusinessweek's Nick Summers: Can the Fed take away easy money without jolting the markets?Who cares? This is the game I’m complaining about. We will prosper by the quality and quantity of our labor and capital. Do not pretend that how they twitch around has any material effect.

Flickr/southbeachcarsFifty years after its founding, Mary Kay Inc. — the company famous for rewarding its top salespeople with pink Cadillacs — has made its founder a billionaire. Richard Rogers was 20 years old when his mother, the eponymous Mary Kay Ash, founded what is now the third-largest direct seller of cosmetics and skincare products, according to Bloomberg. The company nets annual wholesale revenue of $3 billion and has 3 million salespeople across the globe. Rogers owns half of the company, valued at $2.6 billion.  And the multi-level marketing industry has received a strange amount of attention recently, fueled by the feud between billionaire investors Bill Ackman and Carl Icahn over the stock of Herbalife, another such company. From Bloomberg: About 350,000 Mary Kay businesses were started globally in the past year, including 90,000 in the first quarter of 2013, according to a company press release. About half of Mary Kay’s U.S. sales agents are 35-years-old or younger. March was the company’s highest-grossing month on record. Who knows if Herbalife will have Mary Kay's shelf life. Bill Ackman, who is short the stock and has already reportedly lost $300 million, surely hopes not.
Tinkoff Credit SystemsIn 2008, Dmitry Agarkov received an unsolicited letter from Tinkoff Credit Systems (TCS)Â offering the 42-year-old Russian man a credit card with what he found to be unattractive rates. While most people would have just thrown away the letter, Agarkov decided to do something different. He scanned the contract in the letter into his computer and altered it in his favor, including, for example, a 0% interest rate, no fees, and no credit limit. Moreover, every time the bank didn't stick to these rules, they'd be fined 3 million rubles â€” $91,000 â€” which of course would go to Agarkov. If they broke the contract, they'd have to pay Agarkov 6 million rubles ($182,000). Agarkov's altered contract was, surprisingly, accepted and he received a credit card. "The Bank confirmed its agreement to the client's terms and sent him a credit card and a copy of the approved application form," Agarkov's lawyer Dmitry Mikhalevich told Kommersant this week. Two years later TCS sought to close the account due to overdue payments, and at this point, things began to get difficult. Russia Today reports that in 2012 TCS decided to sue Agarkov for 45,000 rubles ($1,363), an amount that featured fees and charges not included in the altered contract. This week a Russian judge decided that Agarkov was right â€” as the bank had signed the contract (apparently without looking at it), they were legally bound to it, and Agarkov was only asked to pay his outstanding balance of 19,000 rubles ($575). TCS isn't out of trouble yet either. Agarkov has reportedly decided to sue the group for breaking the terms of the contract, allegedly for 24 million rubles ($727,000). The court will review his case in September, Russia Today reports. In a counter move, RAPSI news agency reports that TCS is attempting to start a criminal case for fraud against Agarkov. TCS founder Oleg Tinkov took to Twitter to say that his lawyers think the 24 million rubles figure is a "pipe dream" and that Agarkov will get four years in prison for fraud. Agarkov's lawyer told TV Rain that these comments made his client fear for his safety.

On Tesla's Q2 earnings call last night, Elon Musk taunted his competitors, laughing out loud at an analysts' question about the BMW i3. "I'm glad to see that BMW is bringing an electric car to market," Musk said giggling. "That's cool. There's room to improve on the i3 and I hope that they do." And then there was more laughter... for a while. It was obvious that he actually didn't think it (the i3) was that "cool", or that BMW was that "cool" for that matter. What Musk was doing was trolling â€” it was a CEO troll. Now if a Wall Street CEO did something like that, people wouldn't be saying 'oh that eccentric genius.. he can do the impossible, anything even... what's a little giggle?' No, if Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein was on a conference call and laughed at the idea that, say, Wells Fargo was trying to build up a serious sales and trading division you can already cue the etiquette alarms. In fact, back in February, JP Morgan's CEO Jamie Dimon took some heat for unprofessional conduct during a Q&amp;A session. Rolling Stone  called him obnoxious for answering an analysts' question by saying "that's why I'm richer than you." And maybe he was being obnoxious. The point is, he got called out on it. Musk was on an earnings call, not a school yard. If CEOs want to make fun of people (or companies), they should save it for a more private moment. TrollingÂ  just makes them (or anyone) look immature. Additionally, don't forget that BMW has made a lot of excellent cars in its history. It's disrespectful to think they â€” or any of their peers â€” couldn't do it again just because Tesla's disruptive to the status quo. Not to get all Miss Manners on you guys, but seriously, lets keep it together. Listen to Musk giggle below:
Flickr / thinkpanamaThe current crisis in business travel has a lot of parallels to the late 1990s when travelers began to defect from the practice of visiting or phoning their local travel agencies in favor of booking their trips online. Corporate travel agencies such as American Express Global Business Travel and Carlson Wagonlit Travel, and the major corporations they service, are faced with the prospect that droves of their Gen-X and Gen-Y employees are ignoring their mandates to use the prescribed corporate booking tool to book a negotiated rate at Marriott or an American Airlines flight, for example. Instead, these rogue bookers-gone wild want to stay at a Sheraton or W closer to their meeting, fly JetBlue, and they feel compelled to book unauthorized brands so the travelers can wrack up their Starwood Preferred Guest or True Blue points and miles instead. Consider then the position of Alicia Tillman, vice president of marketing and business services for American Express Global Business Travel, who is charged with stemming the tide and plugging what the industry not-so creatively calls â€œleakage.â€ â€œWe have an obligation to solve that,â€ Tillman says, in an interview with Skift. Tillman concedes that this huge challenge to compliance with corporate travel policies is only going to get â€œworse.â€ So Tillman and American Express have come up with what they hope will be the beginnings of a solution: Gamification. American Express has partnered with BadgevilleÂ to use its gamification solution, and just began a pilot with Citrix, a mobile-solutions company, to see if Citrixâ€™s techie employees can be enticed with badges, leader boards, and perhaps some perks like hotel upgrades and free nights, to stick with prescribed corporate travel policies.  With young employees these days used to booking on mobile and websites scattered across the Internet, Tillman is thus fighting that trend and road warriorsâ€™ desire to stick with their favored loyalty programs, using badges, mayorships, leader boards and some upgrades. Based on the demographics of the employees, Tillman argues that gamification is more likely to work in some industries than others. Carlson Wagonlit Travel, too, has its own gamification initiative. To be fair, Tillman admits the pilot with Citrix, which is scheduled to run 30-45 days, is only a first baby step, and Amex will study over the next few months ways to entice engagement with its clientsâ€™ travelers across numerous platforms. â€œWe are going to start here, but we are going to spend the next few months exploring where there are other opportunities,â€ Tillman says. But, with lots of travelers and early adopters already having tired of badges, mayorships and check-ins in social media outlets such as FourSquare, isnâ€™t American Express trying to make workable an idea thatâ€™s already lost its luster? Tillman counters that gamification has never been tried in business travel, and American Express is willing to experiment to see it if can help with travel-policy disruptions. The trend of rogue bookers in business travel was an underlying theme throughout the just-completed GBTA conference in San Diego. Concurâ€™s Open Booking initiative, which is in its very early days, attacks some of the same problems that gamification addresses, albeit in a more comprehensive way. Philip Wolf, the former PhoCusWright chairman, was moderating one of the big sessions at GBTA, and he asked attendees how many supported Open Booking, how many were on the fence, and how many oppose it. The opponents generated the loudest applause, although the other two categories were well-represented. Asked what American Express has against Open Booking, Tillman said the development and infrastructure changes it would require would be cost-prohibitive. Tillman cited the extensive investments that American Express, other travel management companies, and the global distribution systems have ploughed into the current business travel ecosystem. Tillman didnâ€™t say this, but mega travel agencies are essentially constrained by those investments, and arenâ€™t about to abandon them for what they consider might be the flavor du jour. Consider the analogy that it was easier for HotelTonight, starting from scratch, to create a mobile-only hotel app than it was for a much older Hotels.com to mimic it. Letâ€™s be frank: Much of the travel management establishment opposes Open Booking, and any real move toward capturing these rogue bookings on a widespread basis would take years. After well over a third of the GBTA attendees indicated with their applause that they oppose Open Booking, Wolf likened that response to a conference he attended years ago when he told the audience at that time that one day the majority of travel would be booked online. The audience at that earlier conference, Wolf recalled, scoffed at the notion.

You are more likely to be born with an extra finger, get struck by lightning, or die from an insect sting or plane crash. But Shanghaiist notes that one man in Shanghai thought lottery odds were more in his favor, so he spent his entire life savings on tickets. At one point, the 46-year-old was spending 20,000 yuan ($3,200) a day, according to Shanghai Daily. In total, the man hawked four apartments and four cars worth around $967,000 to buy tickets. From Shanghai Daily: He was caught in the destructive cycle of buying tickets; not winning; wanting to win to make up losses; buying more tickets. “I couldn’t stop,” he admitted. Xiao sold his apartments, cars and watches. Then last year, his wife asked for a divorce. Lady Luck did briefly smile on Xiao early this year when he won 400,000 yuan. But this made little impact on his growing losses. Besides, in Macau and some areas of Hong Kong, gambling is illegal in China, but numerous underground rings exist.
Mark Wilson / Getty ImagesJamie DimonJPMorgan Chase disclosed on Wednesday that it faces a criminal and civil probe over whether the bank sold risky mortgage-backed securities to investors before the financial crisis, reports New York Times DealBook. In a quarterly regulatory filing, the bank said a civil division of the US attorney's office has "preliminarily concluded" that JPM violated federal laws when it hawked subprime securities from 2005 to 2007. There's also a parallel criminal inquiry "in a more preliminary stage," according to DealBook. A representative from JPMorgan declined to comment. Another massive problem for JPM here is that the Justice Department is piling onto a bunch of other probes. Attorneys General and prosecutors in California, New York, and Pennsylvania are all carrying out their own investigations. The move comes at a time when the Obama administration is ratcheting up efforts to bring America's banks to court over dangerous practices during the run-up to the financial crisis. On Tuesday, the Justice Department and the SEC accused JPM's contemporary, Bank of America, of similar transgressionsÂ â€” exaggerating the quality of the mortgage loan pool backing $850 million in securities. JPM, the largest U.S. bank by assets, recently ran afoul of energy regulators over alleged market manipulation. The bank agreed to a $410 million settlement.
A tipster sent us this photo of an enterprising young man outside the Battery Park ferry terminal near Goldman Sachs and the NYMEX giving out free donuts and coffee so he can get hired.Â  His name is Michael Penn and he's 23 years old.Â  We caught up with Penn over the phone moments ago. He told us that he wants to get into the investment banking industry in any type of business development role. Setting up this stand outside of the ferry terminal by Goldman was one way to get his name out there. Â  "People were coming up to me. They thought it was a genius idea," he told us, adding, "I wanted to do something innovative and unique and this is a way of differentiating myself amongst the general population. I really enjoyed doing it." Â  According to his website, he graduated from the University of Arizona. He studied abroad with the University of Virginia-sponsored Semester at Sea. Students from that group co-founded an NGO called Finding Refuge, which works with City of Refuge in Ghana to help eradicate child slavery. Penn is currently enrolled in graduate school at Fordham where he's pursuing a master's degree in global management. Â  He's also a chess player. In 1999, when he was 9 years old, he was a U.S. Chess Federation National Co-Champion. Â He was ranked No. 1 in the U.S. for chess in his age category back in 1998, according to his website.Â 
Note: This letter originally appeared in the New York Times and was republished with the paper's and author's permission. The choice being debated in Detroit — whether to sell works from the Detroit Institute of Arts to help pay the city’s debts — is agonizing.  How can we equate a few pieces of canvas with paint on them with the pensions of thousands of firefighters, nurses, police officers, teachers and other civil servants? The same choice is being played out in many other communities across the country. In a sense, we have always had this dilemma, but this time, there are several special factors. One is that cities and towns are going bankrupt, and they can’t continue to provide basic services, let alone support for art museums. Another factor is the stunning rise in prices for works of art. Thousands of works go for over a million dollars every year; eight- and even nine-figure prices are common. Mixed into this is the fact that museums have become dependent on support from federal, state and local government in the form of tax subsidies, tax exemptions, especially from real estate tax, and, most important, tax deductions. At the same time, private donors are being asked to give more and more; how long will the 1 percent agree to subsidize a service for the 99 percent? There are more than 100,000 nonprofit arts organizations in this country, all with their hands out. How can museums justify this kind of support? We claim to be moral institutions, open to all, providing the best to the most, and we all work hard to do just that. But is that really our audience? Don’t we, for the most part, serve the affluent, the educated, the converted, those who are on our side of the income and education gap? Museums make a determined effort to widen their audience — the Detroit Institute of Arts is a leader in that effort — but we are still falling short. The shortfall is where that agonizing question arises: How many lives is a Rembrandt worth?
Greece's jobless rate climbed to 27.6% in May, a new record high. Amid unpopular austerity measures like wage cuts and tax hikes, Greece's figure is more than double the 12.1% average June rate in the eurozone, Reuters reports. Greece's youth population continues to struggle the most, with the jobless rate at 64.9% for those aged 15-24. For the 25-34 crowd, the rate was 37.7%. This chart via Reuters' Pedro da Costa shows just how bad the situation has gotten. Reuters
Yesterday, Tesla Motors beat second quarter earnings expectations by posting a surprise profit.Â  The stock was trading up more than 13% in the pre-market.Â It was last trading around $152 per share. The stock has been on an absolute tear this year.

REUTERS/Joe SkipperDoug KassDoug Kass, the fund manager at Seabreeze Partners, quit Twitter in June. Lots of people were bummed, as Kass can be extremely colorful. In an interview yesterday on CNBC's "Fast Money", he explained his decision to abandon the medium where he'd seemingly be at home: Twitter has some value to day trader; it has little to no value to the real long-term investor. I went off because I felt the digital feed of Twitter empowers mean, weak, angry, misinformed people who hide uder this shroud of anonymity. To me, life is too short to be a punching bag for small people with large egos. And I concluded that it's not worth navigating through a series of sharks to get to the good fish. ... Asked why he didn't simply block those followers he found bothersome, Kass responded: Haters are capable of unblocking themselves. I've learned that these haters are flawed, sometimes very flawed, and often have alternative motives behind the Tweets or ad-hominem attacks — and usually it's to sell something that's not worth that much.  As far as market commentary, Kass admitted that "the last six weeks have not been fun for the ursine crowd," but that he remained net short based on the slowdown in China, mixed economic data and rising interest rates. Here's the full clip:  
Tesla announced its Q2 financial results after the closing bell yesterday, and management shocked investors with a second consecutive quarterly profit. Adjusted EPS came in at $0.20. Analysts were looking for a loss of $0.19. The stock shot up to an all-time high of $154 after the announcement, up 14% from the closing price. "We increase our 6-month price target to $95 from $84 to reflect higher earnings estimates and is based on average stock price implied under 3 scenarios," wrote Goldman Sachs' analyst Patrick Archambault in a note to clients this morning. Obviously, Archambault's target is well below the current price. But,  he can't justify today's price even under his most optimistic scenario. Archambault's model is based on forecasts for 2018, which are discounted to present day.  Here's some color: "...In the first scenario, we assume total sales of 106K (Model S: 56K units, Next Gen: 50K) and operating margins of 15.4% implying an EPS of $6.91. Layering on a 20x multiple given the growth prospects implies a value of $138 which discounted at 20% implies a stock price of $67. We then look at a bull case where we assume that TSLA will be able to get approximately 3.5% global market share in the entry lux and mid-lux category suggesting total volumes of 200K units. The 3.5% market share assumption is consistent with the typical 3-5 year share gains seen by the most successful industry players across multiple luxury sub-segments over the past decade. We assume an operating margin of 15.6% in this scenario as we see TSLA benefitting from better operating leverage given higher volumes. The implied stock price in this scenario comes at $125. We also value Tesla in a mid-case where we assume volumes of 150K units and operating margins of 15.5% which is broadly the mid-point of the two scenarios. The implied price in this scenario is $93. Finally, we take the average of these three scenarios to get our six-month target price of $95..." Under these three scenarios, Archambault is able to yield prices of $67, $93, and $125. Still, he has just a neutral rating on the stock. "The primary risks are the sustainability of demand longer term," he warns.
bytemarks / FlickrThe Department of Labor's latest weekly reading of weekly initial unemployment claims is out, and it's basically in line with expectations. Claims climbed to 333,000, a level which was slightly lower than the 335,000 expected by economists. Last week's reading was revised up to 328,000 from an earlier reading of 326,000. The four-week average is at its lowest level since November 2007.
Last night, during Tesla's earnings call, Elon Musk had a parade. This morning, though the company beat Q2 earnings expectations, Wall Street's shorts still want to rain on it. Tesla reported Q2 profit of $0.20 per share, on revenue of $405 million.  This beat expectations for a loss of $0.19 per share, on revenue of $387.9 million. As a result, the stock shot up 14% in after hours trading. But if you're a Tesla bear, those numbers aren't going to satisfy you.  First, you're thinking that Tesla's earnings beat didn't include lease accounting, certain non-cash items, and one-time charges of $16 million associated with the payoff of the company's DoE loan nine years early (if it had, the company would've reported a net loss of $31 million, or $0.26 a share).  More importantly, if you're a Tesla bear, you're looking at how the company is growing and burning cash.  Musk said on the earnings call that he was "aspiring" to make improvements to their cash position quarter over quarter but wouldn't give any specifics on how that would be managed. And then there's this, from Tesla's letter to shareholders: Q2 revenues were $551 million on a non-GAAP basis and $405 million on a GAAP basis. While deliveries increased by 5% from Q1, overall revenues were flat due to an expected drop in ZEV credit revenue. ZEV credit Tesla Supercharger revenue fell to $51 million this quarter from $68 million last quarter.  Think about that: Deliveries increased, but revenue was flat due to ZEV (zero emission vehicle credits). Those are payments the state of California requires other car companies to pay Tesla to make up for their lack of an electric car model.  As other companies catch up to Tesla and try to enter that market, ZEV revenue will continue to decline. Tesla noted that it would make an impact on their Q3 gross margin at the end of their letter. The question is whether the company can increase deliveries quickly enough to catch up with that loss of revenue, especially given admitted bottle necks in its supply chain. On the call, Tesla's CFO Deepak Ahuja disclosed additional regulatory credits of about $18 million. And there's more, namely Tesla's ambitious plans for growth in Europe and Asia; its expansion of stores, charging stations and its own factory; and its multi-product strategy which forces the company to pour cash into research and development. In short — cost. This is what Bank of America analyst John Lovallo focused on when he took the floor during Tesla's earnings call. First he asked what the company expected for R&amp;D and SG&amp;A in the second half of the year. Ahuja responded that R&amp;D expenditure would be higher in the coming quarter "than you've seen in the last couple of quarters," but didn't get specific. On the SG&amp;A front, he said that the company was improving infrastructure globally "on a variety of fronts." That was all. Then Lovallo really dug in: "If we think about cash flow for a minute... free cash flow was a use of about $79 million in the quarter, and I think if you make the adjustments you guys were talking about... $11 million for the DOE payment, a $67 million increase in receivables that may not occur. That looks like the use of about a million dollars. Now, you have cap ex ramping up in the back half of the year so how are you thinking about free cash flow generation through the remainder of the year into 2014?" Ahuja responded that in the shareholder letter he and Musk wrote that they intended to generate cash flow from operations, but that Lovallo was right in pointing out that it would be offset by capital expenditures.  "We want to be very careful about burning cash," said Ahuja. "We want to stay as close as we can to a free cash flow position... but that's not something we necessarily want to guide to. We're going to manage it... and spend the cap ex where we need to to ensure we're growing at the right pace." Lastly, Lovallo suggested that generally, when it comes to a new vehicle's ramp curve after it launches, volumes tend to peak 7-8 quarters out. Musk broke in saying simply, "I don't think that's going to be the case for the Model S." "The traditional model doesn't apply here," added Ahuja. And that very well may be true, Tesla faithful, but doubts surrounding that are enough to keep the bears out of their caves. Don't shoot the messenger. 
Hero? Or goat?I was minding my own business last night when I got the note below from a respected investor. As you will see, the investor has had it with all the adulation and sympathy being showered on newspaper families like the Grahams, who are being extolled for their decades-long "stewardship" of institutions like the Washington Post and New York Times and pitied for the terrible misfortune they and society have recently endured. In the common telling, the investor observes, the Grahams and other newspaper families are cast as victims of an unforeseeable and horrible trend--the unstoppable rise of an invasive technology that has crippled the newspaper business and threatened a profession that has held society together for decades. The Grahams have done their heroic best, this story goes, but the forces of evil have just been too numerous and overwhelming. Now, finally, the brave and intrepid Grahams have had no choice but to surrender. So the world will now go to the dogs. The real story, the investor believes, is that the Grahams and other 'newspaper families' enjoyed decades of easy money and fame and then were confronted with a significant business challenge. Unlike many business owners, however, the Grahams failed to adapt to it: I can't take it anymore.  All of this high-minded windiness on the Post, the Grahams, journalism, democracy, etc. I took a screenshot of the Post home page the day of the big story itself [see below]. Note the big ad in the upper right of the home page. The CPM [price per thousand views] on that was, what, 5 cents? Slate, ironically, [a Washington Post Company company] analyzed those particular ads a few days ago: These are bottom-of-the-barrel remnant ads. They degrade the user experience, and are essentially consumer fraud on top of that. And that's the best they can do for the main ad on their home page.What we have here is not a story of the decline of newspapers in America blah blah blah.  What we have here is a story of basic business incompetence.  Washington PostI agreed with the investor that the sympathy and adulation for the newspaper families was overblown. If there is another formerly fantastically profitable business in which the mogul owner gets to be referred to as a "steward," for example, I haven't heard of it. But I did point out that what's happening to the newspaper business is classic disruption--an attack from below by cheaper, easier, and simpler services (digital delivery and advertising)--and that getting disrupted is an extremely difficult challenge for a business to overcome. The investor was undeterred. He brought up a print media company in Germany, Burda Media, that has adapted just fine to the rise of the Internet--by quickly diversifying into many successful digital businesses: Do a compare and contrast of the Washington Post Company (or for that matter the New York Times Company) with Burda Media. Hubert Burda was the first media CEO to proactively visit a little Silicon Valley startup called Netscape and has built an amazing digital business since, from very similar starting points (and from Germany!).  Today, Burda employs 10,000 people and is thriving.There was nothing preventing the leadership of American newspaper/magazine companies from doing the same thing over the same period. The investor is right about Burda. They've done an excellent job. And he's right that there was nothing preventing American newspaper companies from doing the same thing.  And the Grahams actually did do the same thing, of course. They bought an education company that quickly became larger and more profitable than their newspaper. That education company, and some other assets (TV), will remain in the family portfolio now that the Washington Post has been jettisoned.  Interestingly, what the Grahams did not do was invest the quite-considerable profits from their other businesses in the future of the Post--a fact that should probably be noted in some of the Graham hagiographies. Instead, they dumped the paper the moment it stopped making them money.  It's easy to "steward" a business when it's also making you rich. It's more difficult when the going gets tough. The good news for the Post, as well as the readers who love it and most of the folks who work there, is that the Post's new owner is perfectly willing to endure losses while investing in the future. (Amazon has been investing in the future for going on 20 years). The Post also has a perfectly healthy and growing digital business. The current digital business won't sustain the print-paper's high cost structure--nothing will--but it will still allow the Post to continue to produce an amazing amount of superb journalism.  And if the Post's new owner, Jeff Bezos, is successful with his "experimentation" over the next few years, the Post's digital business will become a healthy, vibrant, and profitable growth engine. So, let the experimentation begin! SEE ALSO: Here's Why I Think Jeff Bezos Bought The Washington Post

REUTERS/Stephen LamGood morning! Here's what you need to know.
One of the more encouraging accelerator relationships that I track is the close one between real capital spending in the GDP accounts and S&amp;P 500 forward earnings. During the two previous business cycles they both rose to new record highs at the same time. This time, however, forward earnings has been rising into new high ground ever since early 2011, yet real capital outlays still are hovering near the previous cyclical peak. The dramatic rebound in the M-PMI from 50.9 in June to 55.4 in July and in the NM-PMI 52.2 to 56.0 over the same period may be the triggers that boost capital spending to new highs in coming quarters. Our “Second Recovery” scenario seems to be playing out as pent-up demand for autos and houses is finally boosting economic activity. Another happy surprise is that US exports rose to a new record high during June. Contributing to a possible capital spending boom might be a shortage of workers. Yes, I know that the unemployment rate is still very high at 7.4%. However, there is a shortage of knowledge workers, including those with basic manufacturing skills and work experience. The unemployment rate for workers with a college degree is only 3.8%. Businesses may have to rely increasingly on high-tech equipment and software to do the work.  Dr. Ed's Blog Today's Morning Briefing: The Accelerator Effect. (1) The circle of life: GDP and profits drive capital spending, which drives GDP. (2) Hunkering down this time. (3) Lots of cash for dividends and buybacks. (4) Lots of pent up demand for capital goods. (5) Forward earnings is bullish for Industrials. (6) A shortage of knowledgeable and experienced workers. (7) Capital goods output popping in Germany, the UK, and the US. (8) Overweight-rated Industrials are outperforming. (More for subscribers.)
Wikimedia CommonsNo country in the euro zone was safe from the global financial crisis and the ongoing euro crisis. But some countries have fared better than others. Andrew Sheets, Morgan Stanley's top European credit strategist, included the chart below in a presentation he gave on Wednesday. It shows the GDP levels of eight major economies in Europe, indexed to 2008. As you can see, Germany is all the way back to pre-crisis levels and then some.  France and the UK don't have much to complain about either. But among the debt-laden PIGS (i.e. Portugal, Italy, Greece, and Spain) of southern Europe, Greece's current GDP is stuck in ancient Greece. While other eurozone economies are glad they're not Greece, they're still tied to the depressed country through a shared currency. Morgan Stanley
The Bank of Japan wrapped up its two-day monetary policy meeting today, and as expected it made no change to its current policy. "The BoJ will continue to conduct money market operations so that the monetary baseÂ  (Â¥173.3trn as of end-July) will increase at an annual pace of about Â¥60-70trn to reach around Â¥200trn by end- 2013 and Â¥270trn by the end of 2014," said Societe Generale's Takuji Alda and Kiyoko Katahira in a note to clients. However, BoJ head Haruhiko Kuroda stressed the importance of fiscal discipline. â€œEnding deflation and raising the sales tax are achievable at the same time,â€Â  said Kuroda according to Bloomberg's Toru Fujioka and Masahiro Hidaka. â€œRestoring fiscal health is absolutely necessary and important by itself, but once fiscal discipline is loosened, itâ€™s true that that will indirectly make a negative impact on monetary measures.â€ For now, the big question is how long will the BoJ stay on its current path before making any changes. "We think that the best timing for the BoJ to strengthen its QE is when the effect of current QE on the USD/JPY fades out," said the SocGen analysts. "We believe the most likely timing for the next BoJ move is Q2 2014, or perhaps even earlier (Q1 2014). Toru Fujioka &amp; Masahiro Hidaka
Bryn Lennon/Getty ImagesMost markets around the world are up. The U.K.'s FTSE is up 0.2%. Germany's DAX is up 0.1% Spain's IBEX is up 0.3%. Italy's FTSE MIB is up 0.4% France's CAC 40 is flat. Gains in Europe follow mixed moves in Asia, where new Chinese trade numbers crushed expectations, bringing hope that the world's second largest economy wasn't doomed for a hard landing. Japan's Nikkei fell 1.3%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng climbed 0.3% China's Shanghai Composite fell 0.1%. Korea's Kospi climbed 0.3%. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX increased by 1.0% U.S. futures are up modestly ahead of what's expected to be another quiet day for economic data. Later this morning we'll get the latest weekly reading of initial U.S. jobless claims, which are expected to be up slightly from a week ago.
China's July trade growth numbers are out, and they crushed expectations. Exports jumped 5.1% year-over-year, which was much stronger than the 2.0% expected by economists. Imports surged 10.9%, blowing away expectations for 1.0% growth. Assuming they're true, the numbers are definitely welcome consider all of the scares of an economic hard landing amid evidence of a major slowdown. Unfortunately, economists have been quick to raise doubts about the number. "One important question in investors’ mind is whether we can trust the quality of these trade statistics because they were significantly manipulated between October 2012 and April 2013," noted Bank of America Merrill Lynch's Ting Lu. "As RMB/USD stopped appreciating, hot money started flowing out and the government took severe measures to crack down on fake trade after April, we believe the quality of trade data was improved a lot." Lu actually has a proprietary method that accounts for the potential trade data manipulations, and on the bright side, his adjusted numbers were still encouraging. "Using our adjustment method for fake trade (developed in May), adjusted export growth in July rose to 3.5% yoy from -4.3% in June and adjusted import growth rose to 10.3% yoy from -1.2% in June," he said. So even though some might think the officials numbers were massaged, the numbers were probably directionally correct at the least. "Together with the rebounding official PMI to 50.3 in July from 50.1 in June, July trade data are supportive of a better economic outlook for China and will surely help boost market confidence," said Lu. "We are happy to maintain our above-consensus prediction of 7.5% yoy GDP growth for 2H13 and a sequential recovery to 1.9% QoQ in 2H from 1.7% in 2Q."
