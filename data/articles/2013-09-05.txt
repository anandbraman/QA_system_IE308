This year, more than thirty private high schools in the U.S. are charging more than $40,000 in tuition,Â with the most expensive reaching almost $45,000 â€” more expensive than many colleges.  But with premium costs come premium perks like iPads, state-of-the-art athletic and learning facilities, and clubs for every interest imaginable. We calculated the most expensive private schools based on day student tuition plus mandatory fees (including one-time fees, where listed). Boarding-only schools and schools for students with special needs were not included. If you think we missed a school, tell us in the comments and we'll check it out.
REUTERS/Heino KalisAll eyes will be on Friday's August jobs report. "We expect a 200k gain in nonfarm payrolls in August, modestly above consensus expectations of 180k and in line with the 6- and 12-month moving averages," wrote Goldman Sachs' David Mericle in a note blasted to clients. "We expect that the unemployment rate held steady at 7.4% after a two-tenths decline in July, with some risk of a further decline to 7.3%." Mericle points to five reasons why he thinks it'll be strong. We paraphrase: The report comes out at 8:30 a.m. ET on Friday. We'll cover it live at BusinessInsider.com.
A hearty thank you to BarStoolSports for posting this video of two men duking it out on the Metra because one of them insisted on taking a phone call on the quiet car. The fight being on the Metra means it was in Chicago, which makes sense since the guy who made the phone call screamed "I sit on the Board of Trade. I will cut you in half!!!" during the fight. That was after his opponent screamed "You're a d---. You're a d---." No, this video is NSFW. Now, say what you want, but the rules are to be quiet, so we understand why this happened. It's just amazing that it was caught on video. If you video taped this, e-mail me. Seriously. Watch below: 
REUTERS/Robert Galbraith FA Insights is a daily newsletter from Business Insider that delivers the top news and commentary for financial advisors. Muni Bonds Are Still An Attractive Long-Term Investment (Vanguard) Detroit's bankruptcy filing again raised concerns about muni bonds. But Vanguard's municipal bond expert, Chris Alwine thinks muni bonds are attractive on a historical valuation basis. While they do face risks form Fed tapering and the debt-ceiling debate he thinks it is important for investors to "tune out short-term noise." "Muni bonds remain an attractive long-term investment despite the headwinds we've been facing. Even with rising rates, munis play an important diversifying role in a long-term asset allocation strategy. In our view, muni bonds are attractive compared with taxable bonds on a tax-equivalent yield basis. Also, muni yields have historically been less sensitive to rising rates than Treasuries, adding a stabilizing dimension to an investment portfolio." Focus On Process Not Past Performance (Think Advisor) That past performance has no predictive value when it comes to investing is accepted. But the investment industry largely relies on performance goals instead of process. But there are two "notable pockets of opportunity where we can find funds and fund managers that focus exclusively on processâ€”one relatively small and the other very large," writes Marhsall Jaffe of Jaffe Asset Management for Think Advisor. "There is a small universe of talented and successful investor/managers who run funds that do not stray from their (human and evolving) investment process, irrelevant to market direction, investor sentiment or headlines. Most of these managers invest heavily in their own funds and could care less about benchmarks, sectors or asset classes. They are just buying businessesâ€”one at a timeâ€”and holding them, sometimes for decades. They keep to their knitting, learn from their mistakes and donâ€™t sweat over the things they canâ€™t control. "It might surprise you to learn that the single most popular investment choice today are specialized funds driven purely by process; but I doubt investors are thinking in those terms when they decide to buy index funds. Even though the process of an index fund is mechanical and unvarying, index funds still outperform most managed funds. And thanks to Dr. Tuckett we know why: In an obsessive but fruitless drive for performance too many fund managers compromise the single most important weapon in their arsenal: their investment process." The Stock Market Has A Track Record Of Bottoming Days Before A Military Strike (LPL Financial) "Although the circumstances surrounding prior conflicts have been varied, investors have experienced the same emotional response and, as a result, the markets yielded a similar outcome," writes Jeff Kleintop of LPL Financial.Â  "Most military conflicts have prompted a common pattern in the stock market: impending was acted as a negative from when the United States committed to action until action began; once action began, markets rebounded. â€¦In recent decades, the pattern changed slightly, with the stock market bottoming and starting to recover ahead of the military strike." LPL Financial Generation Z Is Getting More And More Worried About Their Finances (Investment News) 46% of Americans between the ages of 14 and 23 that are often dubbed Generation Z are worried about student debt, according to a survey for TD Ameritrade. This is up from 39% (between the ages of 13-22) in 2012, according to Investment News. And Generation Z is already getting antsy about retirement, with 39% saying they won't be able to count on social security, compared with 31% in 2012.Â  Carrie Braxdale at TD Ameritrade however told Investment News Generation Z needed to be better informed in terms financial planning. 44% said a savings account was the best way to save for retirement, compared with 11% that said investing in the stock market is the best way to save for retirement. That Correlation Between Stocks And The Fed Is Disappearing (Pragmatic Capitalism) There has been a positive correlation between S&amp;P500 returns and the Fed's quantitative easing program. But this has changed. "In fact, the 26 week rolling average between the S&amp;P 500 and changes in the Fed balance sheet have been notably negative in the last few months," writes Cullen Roche of Pragmatic Capitalism. "This doesnâ€™t mean the 'tapering' doesnâ€™t matter, but it does appear as though the equity market is becoming less concerned with the risk of a reduced balance sheet." Morgan Stanley

REUTERS/Tony GentileDaniela Santanch talks to Silvio BerlusconiFollowing a court decision that found him â€” finally â€” guilty of a crime, sentenced to jail time, and banned from political office, Silvio Berlusconi has a stunning response: his allies may pull out of Italy's coalition government unless he receives a pardon or some other kind of clemency. That's a pretty brutal threat. Berlusconi is effectively holding his own country hostage â€” the coalition would collapse without the support of his PdL party, and markets are terrified of more political instability in the country. Would Berlusconi really go through with it? He certainly wants people to think he's serious. According to Reuters, Daniela Santanche, a key ally called the "the pythoness" due to her support for the billionaire former Prime Minister, announced today that Berlusconi has prerecorded a video that he plans to release when the government collapses. "It's ready, Berlusconi will decide when to broadcast it and I think it is absolutely imminent,"Â Santanche said. "Personally, I don't think we can remain sitting next to people who want to be the butchers of Berlusconi." 
APIt looks like Bill de Blasio is about to become the next mayor of New York City, and one of his signature policy proposals is an income tax increase on wealthy New Yorkers to pay for pre-Kindergarten and after school programs. He'd raise New York City's top income tax rate from 3.876% to 4.41%, but only on incomes over $500,000. Here's what you should know about the tax: So, all that said: Is De Blasio's tax plan a good idea? I'm actually agnostic on it. I don't think New York City government needs more money; we already have some of the highest taxes in the country, on income and also on rental and commercial property. Our sales tax rate is also high, though lots of items are exempt from sales tax. The city uses those receipts to finance an unusually high level of per-capita spending. Over the last decade, much of the city's rising tax receipts have gotten sucked into a vortex of pension and employee health care costs that the Bloomberg administration has been unable to control. All of which is to say, if it's important for New York City to make new investments in pre-Kindergarten and after school programs, it ought to be able to find the money by cutting the budget elsewhere. De Blasio even nods to this by making the tax proposal temporary; he told the New York Times that after five years he'd seek to replace the tax with another funding source or cost cuts elsewhere. Perhaps he's hoping to negotiate savings on pension benefits or employee healthcare in the meantime. That said, I think the risk of economic damage from higher income taxes is oversold, at least in the specific context of New York City. It's not that taxes don't influence economic decisionmaking; the whole reason that Greenwich and Stamford have emerged as centers for the hedge fund industry is a desire to avoid taxation in New York. But New York has changed over the last few decades in ways that make it more desirable than ever as a place for the global elite to live and work. You can see this in soaring prices for luxury real estate. New York City's capacity to get away with taxing the hell out of the wealthy is likely higher than ever. The principal barriers to job creation and growth in New York City are non-tax factors, with the extremely high cost of both housing and commercial real estate are at the top of the list. The city also has a punishing regulatory environment. Some industries (think banking, advertising, media, fashion and law) have good reasons to put up with the cost and hassle; others get pushed out. If the next mayor implements effective policies to bring down the pre-tax cost of living and working in New York (a big if), that would more than offset any economic damage that would come from a 0.534% increase in income tax rates on New York's wealthiest residents. So if you're worried about New York's economy, you should probably focus on what the candidates have to say about real estate development more than their tax plans.
The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note just passed 3.0% for the first time since July 2011. Reuters' Jennifer Ablan tweeted the news at 4:48 p.m. ET. For much of the day the yield had been sitting above just above 2.9%. Interest rates started to rally notably in back in May, which was when the Federal Reserve began to warn the markets that it would begin to taper its quantitative easing program (QE). QE, formally known as the large-scale asset purchase program, consists of the monthly purchases of $45 billion worth of Treasury bonds and $40 billion worth of mortgage bonds. QE has helped keep government borrowing costs and mortgage rates extremely low. The Taper Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said the tapering could begin this fall if the health of the labor market and the direction of inflation could support it. Here's Bernanke on June 19: "If the incoming data are broadly consistent with this forecast, the Committee currently anticipates that it would be appropriate to moderate the monthly pace of purchases later this year; and if the subsequent data remain broadly aligned with our current expectations for the economy, we would continue to reduce the pace of purchases in measured steps through the first half of next year, ending purchases around midyear." Most market economists have projected that the taper would be announced on September 18 at the conclusion of the Federal Reserve's next two-day Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. However, all economists have also said that the Fed would likely wait for the August jobs report, which comes out on Friday morning, before it makes any final decisions. The Jobs Report "August employment takes on more significance than usual because it is the last employment report that Fed policymakers will have before they sit down for a two-day FOMC meeting later this month (September 17-18)," wrote Deutsche Bank's Joe LaVorgna in a note to clients today. Most indicators have confirmed that the August jobs report would come in at least near the 180,000 currently forecasts by economists. Earlier today, we learned that the four-week moving average for initial unemployment insurance claims fell to its lowest level since October 2007.Â  Minutes later, we learned that the August employment sub-index of the widely-followed ISM services index surged to 57.0 in August from 53.2 in July. "While the ISM employment measures are not the best m/m indicator of employment growth, they are certainly consistent with a strengthening trend," said UBS's Drew Matus. "Taken with the continued improvement in jobless claims along with other recent positive labor-related data, we have pushed up our payroll forecast for August. We now expect 210k on payrolls (cons: 180k), up from our earlier 170k estimate." Economists including those at JP Morgan and Nomura also said that the ISM report presented "upside risk" to tomorrow's jobs report. All of this firmed the conviction of those forecasting a September taper. Here's a year-to-date look at the 10-year yield via Bloomberg.com. Bloomberg.com

acrossthefader.orgMcDonald's Dollar Menu could soon get more expensive.  Food price inflation has made items on the Dollar Menu less profitable, with the $1 burger especially problematic after last year's droughts, reports Leslie Patton at Bloomberg News.  McDonald's needs to start charging $1.50 or $2 for Dollar Menu items, Peter Saleh, an analyst at Telsey Advisory Group, told Bloomberg.  But McDonald's will have to tread carefully to keep price-conscious customers coming back.  The Big Mac (at an average price of $3.57) is too expensive for many Americans. Instead, McDonald's is promoting its $1 cheeseburger, fries, drinks and wraps, according to the Wall Street Journal. "Value is critical right now," Lynne Collier, restaurant analyst at Sterne Agee, told WSJ. "The consumer is still very weak, facing higher gas prices, the payroll tax increase and employment barely inching up. Value is the No. 1 driver of traffic, and all these restaurant companies are dying for traffic."

The official prediction for tomorrow's jobs report is 180,000 new jobs. But here's a chart getting passed around that we just saw from Dave Lutz of Stifel, Nicolaus. It shows the employment subindex from the ISM non-manufacturing report (red line) vs. the monthly change in Non-Farm Payrolls (blue line). If Non-Farm Payrolls matches the rise in the ISM then we're looking at a number of over 300K. FRED
Michael Loccisano/Getty ImagesEconomists expect the Federal Reserve to announce later this month that it is tapering its monthly purchases of $45 billion worth of Treasury bonds and $40 billion worth of mortgage bonds. However, if tomorrow's jobs report (est. +180,000 payrolls, 7.4% unemployment rate) is really terrible, the Fed may be forced to delay the taper. This is probably unlikely. As long as the jobs report is mediocre or better, there will be tapering, say economists. But, that's where the debate begins. It's not just about when the taper will begin. Rather, the bigger issue may be how fast and furious will the taper be. Here's Deutsche Bank's Joe LaVorgna with his take: A more sizeable gain in August payrolls coupled with upward revisions and an even larger drop in the unemployment rate below our forecast, would likely engender a much larger-than-expected tapering of QE than what some market participants expect—we anticipate a $25 billion reduction in asset purchases split as follows: -$10 billion in mortgages (to $30 billion per month) and -$15 billion in treasuries (to $30 billion per month). If, however,[Friday]'s results are much weaker than expected, then a taper-light situation should ensue, meaning that we would likely get a reduction of $15 billion (-$5 billion in mortgages and -$10 billion in treasures). We suspect that [Friday]’s data will leave the taper-big versus taper-light debate unresolved, which means the remainder of the economic data between now and September 17-18 (i.e., retail sales, jobless claims, industrial production, CPI and housing construction) will dictate the outcome of the meeting. LaVorgna forecasts 190,000 nonfarm payrolls in August with the unemployment rate falling to 7.3%. Here's a chart of how the Fed's Primary Dealers see the taper rolling out. It also includes the path forecasted by the analysts at Societe Generale. Societe Generale
REUTERS/ Jim YoungThose watching tomorrow's job report will be looking to the figures on part-time jobs, which have been the major contributor of overall job growth so far this year. Last month, part-time jobs jumped by 174,000 to 28,233,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' household study. Some economists have pointed to the Affordable Care Act's employer mandate as reason for the pattern. Because the government will require firms with over 50 employees to offer health insurance, companies have been scaling back hours to cut costs, the theory goes. Though, the White House said earlier this summer it would delay enforcement of the mandate until 2015. Guggenheim's Scott Minerd points to the potential problem with this trend: Over the past seven months, the average monthly growth in full-time jobs has been 32,000, while the average number of new part-time jobs was 104,000. After falling from the recession peak of 20 percent, the share of total jobs which are part-time has recently rebounded to 19.6 percent. The increase in part-time jobs may be partially attributable to the upcoming change in health care laws, requiring employers to provide health insurance to full-time employees but not for part-time workers. If the trend continues, the increasing share of part-time workers may add downward pressure to aggregate labor earnings and reduce consumption growth. Guggenheim
Morgan StanleyItâ€™s generally noted that QE and the S&amp;P 500 have been positively correlated. Â But that positive correlation hasnâ€™t remained true through all of the various QE programs. Â In fact, the 26 week rolling average between the S&amp;P 500 and changes in the Fed balance sheet have been notably negative in the last few months. Â This doesnâ€™t mean the â€œtaperingâ€ doesnâ€™t matter, but it does appear as though the equity market is becoming less concerned with the risk of a reduced balance sheet. Â Hereâ€™s more via Morgan Stanley: While Fed tapering has dominated much of the conversation since June, we feel compelled to reiterate our stance that theÂ Fed will remain extremely accommodative. It is true that theÂ correlation between the week-over-week change in the FedÂ balance sheet and S&amp;P500 performance began to diminish earlier in the year (Exhibit 6). It is also true, however, thatÂ tapering to $65 billion per month of purchases this month wouldÂ be equivalent to the announcement of QE2. In other words,Â we are very far from tightening and expect accommodation to reign.

Markit Economics today published August's JPMorgan Global All-Industry Output Index, a metric that takes a weighted average of all of the world's manufacturing and services purchasing managers indices (PMIs). The composite index climbed to 55.2 in August, up from 54.0 in July. This is the highest level since February 2011. "New order growth also hit a 30-month high, stimulating one of the steepest gains in payroll numbers for over two years," noted the Markit economists. "Growth of global economic activity accelerated to a two-and- a-half year high in August," said JPMorgan's David Hensley. "Manufacturing is showing renewed signs of strengthening to support the recent solid upswing in the services sector. The pass-through of higher activity to the jobs market is taking greater hold and should improve further as the GDP upturn continues in coming months." All good news. Markit Economics / JPMorgan
Danielle Buma via www.flickr.com creative commonsSilicon Alley beats Silicon Valley for entrepreneurship in at least a few areas. GGV Capital venture capital associate Andy Manoske laid out the advantages in a post on Quora, reprinted below with permission: With regards to venture capital/startup economics and not nightlife, quality of restaurants, and the existence of an actually-functional public transportation system (even though these are all important):Â Â  All of these points apply just as much for investors as they do for startups. There are a lot of VCs on the east coast with a strong background in consumer products, fintech, and adtech that are based in NYC. Similarly, the strategic investment arms for major east coast financials and east coast brands are also heavily represented in NYC. We asked Manoske in an email whether he thought New York was ultimately better for entrepreneurship. He said he wouldn't go that far: I think there isn't an absolute "better" or "worse" for VCs when it comes to geography. San Francisco and Silicon Valley certainly have many regional benefits due to the sheer size of their entrepreneurial community. But many other areas of the country - NYC being one of them - benefit from having unique characteristics conducive to building certain kinds of businesses there. I covered this a bit in my question, but it's arguably easier to build some kinds of ad tech, consumer internet, and fin tech companies in NYC. The price economics of other critical resource marketsÂ  (i.e.: hiring engineers) is also potentiallyÂ betterÂ in NYC due to the smaller and less culturally/economically-dominant tech sector in places like Manhattan and Queens.Â  Where successful companies go, VCs will follow. If you're a VC focused on tech sectors that do very well in NYC for any of the above reasons, it makes a lot of sense to set up shop somewhereÂ veryÂ far east of Sand Hill Road. And you can probably do pretty well there too. You can find more commentary on the advantages of New York City for VCs at Quora.
Reuters/Rebecca CookThis morning we saw the ISM non-manufacturing figureÂ unexpectedly climbÂ to 58.6 in August, up from 56.0 in July.  But it was the employment sub-index â€” which spiked to 57.0 from 53.2 in JulyÂ â€”Â that has economists really pumped for Friday's job report. The ISM report has spurred UBS economist Drew Matus to up his firm's call for Friday to 210,000 on payrolls (their earlier estimate was 170,000). Matus explains in a new note to clients: Similarly, ISM employment indexes look consistent with payroll gains of around 300k per month (see chart on page 2). While the ISM employment measures are not the best m/m indicator of employment growth, they are certainly consistent with a strengthening trend. Taken with the continued improvement in jobless claims along with other recent positive labor-related data, we have pushed up our payroll forecast for August. We now expect 210k on payrolls (cons: 180k), up from our earlier 170k estimate. We continue to expect a pause in the unemployment rate at 7.4%, after a 0.2 pt drop in July. Initial jobless claims fell more than expected in the week of August 31: -9k to 323k (cons &amp; UBSe 330k). The prior week was revised to 332k from 331k. A Labor Dept. analyst mentioned that three states estimated claims in the latest week, but that the estimated states had little effect on the drop. Smoothing through the weekly data, new claims have suggested further improvement in the labor market. The four-week average, at 329k, was down from 332k the prior week, 342k at the end of July and 346k at the end of June. "For the ISM, the level continues to indicate a rebound in growth in H2 after H1â€™s sluggish performance," Matus wrote. Like Matus said, the median forecast for tomorrow nonfarm payrolls report is +180,000.
Capital One Bank, my business bank since 2004,[1] called me yesterday. â€œGreat News!â€ chirped the person who introduced herself as my business account manager, but who Iâ€™ve never met, and who has had no previous conversation with me before, ever. â€œOk,â€ I replied flatly, immediately wary, because banks are not generally in the Great News business, in my experience. â€œWeâ€™re in the process of switching all of our business customers over to new checking accounts by January 2014, and I thought Iâ€™d give you a call to tell you about the two great options you can choose from!â€ â€œOk.â€ â€œYou have previously been in the Completely Free Checking account, but weâ€™re transitioning all of our customers away from that account, and you can choose from either a Cash Back Account, or an Interest Checking Account!â€ â€œOk.Â  Tell me about the Cash Back Account.â€ â€œAssuming you have a balance of at least $2,000, then for every transaction you make per month, whether a deposit or withdrawal or transfer, weâ€™ll credit you with $0.10!â€ â€œI donâ€™t make many transactions per month, but it sounds nice, whatâ€™s the catch?â€ â€œWe limit the number of transactions in the Cash Bank Account to 100 per month.Â  If you go over that many, we charge $19.95!â€ â€œOk.Â  What about the other account?â€ â€œWith Interest Checking, if you keep an average balance of at least $10,000 we pay you interest, and you have an unlimited number of transactions.Â  If you have less than a $10,000 balance in the account, we charge $19.95!â€ â€œWhat kind of interest?â€ â€œRight now we pay 0.2%!â€ â€œOk.â€ â€œSo which one would you like to choose?â€ â€œWell, let me see if Iâ€™ve got my math straight here:Â  With the first type of account you give me â€˜cash backâ€™ but that is capped at a total of $10 maximum, but above 100 transactions Iâ€™m paying $19.95 per month.Â  So I earn an increasing amount up to $10 the more activity I have, but then suddenly I pay $20 just after I qualify for the $10 â€˜Cash Back.â€™ Â Â And then with the second type of account, letâ€™s say I keep my $10,000 balance in your account, you will pay me $20 per month on that size balance, but again you get the right to ding me basically that same $20 anytime I dip below $10,000.â€ â€œThatâ€™s right!Â  Which one would you like to choose?â€ â€œWell, really, neither.â€ Then, the cross sell The conversation went on from there, and involved her trying to get me to take out a business credit card with Capital One (I donâ€™t need another business credit card) because that could eliminate my fees if I had at least one transaction per month on the card. Of course I actually do have a business credit card with Capital One, but with a different business entity, but that doesnâ€™t count, because that would involve logic and human decision-making and taking into account a customerâ€™s actual business relationship, which as Iâ€™ve written before has absolutely no place in modern banking. Whatâ€™s my problem here? So why did this phone call remind me of why banks suck? Itâ€™s not precisely the dehumanization, the elimination of judgment, that I complained about before. And I swear itâ€™s not because they want to change me from completely free to charging fees. Well, itâ€™s partly that, but in a really specific way. I donâ€™t mind paying some fees, and I do believe banks should charge for their services, one way or another. No, what really gives me diaper rash in this situation is Capital Oneâ€™s introduction of an essentially hidden, complicated, and disingenuous pricing scheme. â€œCash Back Checking?â€ Itâ€™s called â€œCash Back Checkingâ€ but your number-of-transactions algorithm means I either get a fraction of $10, or I pay $19.95?Â  And the way you charge me month-to-month could toggle back and forth, just like phone plans with a limited number of minutes that suddenly fall over the cliff and get expensive when I go over the limit? All that means is that I canâ€™t predict what Iâ€™m paying for the service on a monthly basis.Â  Meanwhile Capital One has all the information for determining fees.Â  In case I want to inquire, Iâ€™m facing long waits in voicemail and call-center hell. â€œInterest Checkingâ€ Also, your â€œInterest Checkingâ€ is a joke as well.Â  $20 on a $10K balance, but with the right to charge $20 when the average balance drops? Â Obviously consistently larger business balances will go to higher interest-bearing accounts, and much more so, when rates actually rise to something meaningful. Itâ€™s the toggling back and forth between â€œinterestâ€ and â€œfees,â€ when the interest is hardly significant in the first place, that shows the point here is not a straightforward fee structure, but rather the smoke-and-mirrors of a bait and switch. So itâ€™s not really the fees that scratches the rash, itâ€™s the opacity. Opacity is always a bankerâ€™s friend.Â  Opacity is also a reason to end a friendship. &nbsp; Please also see related post:Â  Why You Hate Your Bank and Maybe there&#8217;s hope, The kitty called me back [1] Actually I signed up with North Fork Bank, a business-oriented bank built up on Long Island, then making an aggressive push into Manhattan at the time I started my business.Â  Their Free Business Checking was of course why I went with them in 2004.Â  But in an era of constant bank mergers, it makes no sense to expect a bank to maintain the same deal over the years, or to expect any personnel to stay in place.Â  North Fork fatefully bought Alt-A giant Greenpoint Mortgage in 2005 (seemed like a good idea at the time!), then got bought by Capital One in 2006.Â  Capital One announced the elimination of Alt-A lending in August 2007 and took a massive hit on that investment.Â  Ah, shareholder-wealth destruction via bank mergerâ€¦good times!

REUTERS/ Yuriko NakaoThanks to strict termination customs in Japan, some workers have avoided firing by staying in job purgatory at their companies — banished to "chasing-out rooms" to surf the web and read the newspaper. The New York Times' Hiroko Tabuchi reported last month on the trend in Japan, where lifetime positions are the expectation. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Japanese firms hope to reverse the social taboo against massive layoffs in order to revitalize the economy. But many employees are resistant. From the Times: Sony, Mr. Tani’s employer of 32 years, consigned him to this room because they can’t get rid of him. Sony had eliminated his position at the Sony Sendai Technology Center, which in better times produced magnetic tapes for videos and cassettes. But Mr. Tani, 51, refused to take an early retirement offer from Sony in late 2010 — his prerogative under Japanese labor law. So there he sits in what is called the “chasing-out room.” He spends his days there, with about 40 other holdouts. “I won’t leave,” Mr. Tani said. “Companies aren’t supposed to act this way. It’s inhumane.” That's somewhat of a contrast from the United States, where firings are so intrinsic to American culture that the art of termination was made into a George Clooney movie.

Flickr/vitamintakerNo, this is not the beach, but it probably looks like this one.All Suffolk County wanted to do was sell a little strip of beach front property 1-foot-wide by 1,885-feet-long. The county set the bidding at $10, according to Newsday, and contacted the adjacent owners. Simple, right? Wrong. Enter two bankers that would stop at nothing to get that strip â€” Kyle N. Cruz, a managing director at Centerbridge Partners LP and Marc Helie of Chevalier Investments. Both men showed up armed with $1,500 and the title to their properties on May 30. And then it was war, according to the Suffolk County property manager (from Newsday): "We've had one or two pieces start off at $400 and maybe go to $10,000, but never like this," Wayne R. Thompson said. "But you know what water's worth . . . You can say, 'Oh, yes, I have a right of way to the water.' " Yes, Suffolk County is home to the Hamptons, and this specific piece of land sits in Napeague, a village of super-expensive homes just west of Montauk (where all the hip kids are going these days), and gives the owner beach access. So maybe it's worth what was ultimately a bidding war that went back and forth 34 times and ended with a $120,000 price tag (Helie won, for the record). Thompson told Newsday that he "gathered" that one man "really did not want the other one walking over his property to the water." Cruz will now have to walk over Helie's property to get to the ocean a few hundred feet away. Competitive much?
HotelTonightSam Shank, HotelTonight CEOSam Shank's on-demand booking app, HotelTonight, has raised a $45 million Series D round, bringing its total fundraise to $80.5 million. HotelTonight works with 3,000 hotels in 120 cities to help fill open rooms at the last minute. It offers the rooms at a heavy discount to 6.5 million people who have downloaded the app.Â  The lead investor is Coatue Management, a hedge fund that has a lot of experience with the online travel sector. It was a large shareholder in Expedia and Priceline, for example, and it has a robust research team that will help Shank dig up industry insights. GGV Capital, Battery Ventures, Accel Partners, U.S. Venture Partners and First Round Capital also invested.Â  Increasingly, hedge funds like Coatue Management are investing in startups. That's because companies are staying private for longer than ever before. If hedge funds want to be in big companies, they have to get in early.  In 1996 more than 800 companies went public, according to a report by SecondMarket's Barry Silbert. Most companies raised less than $50 million and took an average of four years to IPO or get acquired. Now the average IPO time has doubled to ten years. Shank isn't eying an IPO anytime soon, but a mobile-first startup like his has the potential to become the next Kayak. His team has already seen a change in behavior on its platform; having information at your finger tips is becoming the norm. This mentality helped Uber become a $3.5 billion company.  While Shank's 6.5 million downloads may not sound like much, most of those users are completing transactions on his platform. Shank says both revenue and the number of transactions on HotelTonight have increased 300% in the past year. Shank has raised a lot of money because he says he wants to continue to "move fast and be aggressive." It also takes a period of time before each new HotelTonight city reaches profitability. While Uber, another on-demand app, has created a big business by focusing on logistics, Shank is focused on bookings. Someday, those bookings may expand beyond hotels, the same way Orbitz handles everything from hotels, to car rentals, to flights. "There's a lot of ways we could expand and we know a lot about people who have an on-demand need for a product or service â€“ more than just about anyone, so we're uniquely positioned [to expand]," Shanks says. "That said, we're more focused on shelter and finding a place to stay when you're not at home."
We just told you that if current rates hold, there will be one new solar installation built in the U.S. every 83 seconds by 2016, for a total of 9 gigawatts. Deutsche Bank's Vishal Shah, Jerimiah Booream-Phelps and Susie MinÂ are out with an even more bullish projection: they think that the U.S. could hit 50 gigawatts (although this would still only be 2% of the entire U.S. energy picture): Deutsche Bank Â They offer five reasons for their outlook: 1) Â Solar is already cost competitive in 10 states. Deutsche Bank estimates the levelized cost of energy for solar to be $0.11 to $0.15 per kilowatt hour, compared with $0.11 to $0.37 kilowatt hour for retail electricity, for states including New Jersey, New York, Connecticut and Vermont (along with the usual suspects like California). "Considering the improved economics of solar in these markets along with other growth enablers such as solar leasing, availability of low cost financing, we expect installed capacity growth of ~600% over the next 4 years," they write. 2) Â Solar will soon be cost competitive in 12 other states. Electricity in the existing parity states is slightly more expensive. But Deutsche Bank predicts the overall cost of solar will decline to $2.50 from $3.00 over the next 18 months, at which point states that enjoy historically cheaper electricity including Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and Maryland, along with Washington DC, will see parity. 3) Â Renewable corporations are getting smarter about how they're structured.Â  More companies are creating "C" corporations that act as holding companies for renewable assets. These are also known as YieldCos. RenewableGridMag has compared YieldCos to REITs and MLPs, which enjoy special tax breaks. "If investors value MLP and REIT assets at 7% to 8% distributable cashflow yield, there is good reason to believe they will value renewable assets at similar, if not lower, yields."Â Â Deutsche Bank says the tax benefits enjoyed by YieldCos canÂ reduce solar financing costs by up to 300 bps, "in addition to providing significant amount of liquidity within the solar sector." Ultimately, YieldCos can bring the levelized cost of energy down toÂ $0.08-$0.14 per kilowatt hour from $0.10 to $0.16. 4) Â The expiration of the solar investment tax credit in 2016 could see a flurry of new installations coming on line. Currently, the ITC stands at 30% of the cost of purchase. Deutsche Bank assumes there will be a big new push into solar as the ITC expires. But if it's extended Deutsche Bank estimates a full 47 states will be able to reach grid parity. 5) Â Solar leasing is booming. Solar leasing allows residents to get solar installed on their home for free, and pay nothing for maintenance. Deutsche Banks says solar leasing firms are already "highly profitable" and will see greater incentive to go after users before the expiration of the ITC in 2016. The revolution is real.
Julia La Roche for Business InsiderQuestion-and-answer site Quora tweeted a link this morning to a thread calledÂ "What is it like being a woman on Wall Street?"Â  An anonymous Ivy League-educated woman, who says she worked on Wall Street for 10 years, has a fascinating response full of anecdotes from her time in finance. She left Wall Street more than five years ago and notes that things may have changed.Â  In her response, she describes challenges she personally faced, like when men in the office would address internal mail with her bra size next to her name, or when married traders would get smashed and call her up late at night and hit on her.Â Â  The anonymous former finance worker also says that it was difficult to report bad behavior in the industry because she was afraid she might lose her job. She writes about how one of her married superiors "got too physical" over cocktails and she slapped him in front of another male colleague. Â She said she was the one who had to apologize for the incident.Â  Her response doesn't paint a totally grim picture for women working in Wall Street.Â  She says that she really liked working in finance and that she learned extremely valuable skills. Â She also says that there were several instances when male co-workers would stand up for her. Â  Here's her full response from Quora: Â  I liked working on Wall Street, in an industry overwhelmingly dominated by men, and very smart people who are amply rewarded.Â  It's fast-paced, exciting, brash, and you have to be on top of your game, all the time.But there are many challenges.Â  I worked on Wall Street for over a decade; and following is a very small sample of what I experienced: There are many more stories like this; none particularly awful, I guess. Heck, that's why I got an Ivy League education and graduate degree, so I could learn how to brush aside that kind of nonsense.Â  Right?These were a few of the lessons learned:Â  There are some clubs I don't want to be a part of, even if they're elite and powerful.Â Â  I think similar rationales are part of the reason why there aren't more women, still, in the most senior ranks of Wall Street.Â Â There were also times when the men I worked with stood up for me, set me up for promotions and supported me professionally and personally, in ways that I can't begin to repay them for.Â Â One time, at a dinner at a very nice NYC restaurant, while we were waiting for a table and I was at the bar, some guy wandered over and started trying to hit on me.Â  I could see my boss's boss watching from a table in the cocktail area.Â  I couldn't shake the guy. So, finally, my boss's boss walked over, and said "hey buddy, can't you see she doesn't want to talk to you?" The guy looked at him and said "what's it to you? you like her boyfriend or something?" And my boss's boss just called the bartender over and said "this man is leaving.Â  pick up the tab and get out of here".Â  And the guy pulled out his black card, paid the tab and left.Â  My boss's boss was very good at keeping expenses down.Â  Some of those guys were like my brothers; and I respect and adore them and their families, and stay in touch.Â Occasionally, even positive feedback could be awkward; there's a slightly bitter flavor to the promotion or the bonus that comes with -" you're good at this, better than john and bill and bob. Our performance/numbers shows it.Â  Plus, you're nicer to look at."Â  All you can do is smile, and say "thank you."Â  Because, you know - that matters.Â Things may have changed, or maybe it's just become subtler and more insidious.Â  I left over 5 years ago, because my husband got a job offer in another place.Â  He finally got to a point in his career where he was making close to as much money as I was; even though the opportunity for increased financial success in his career was much less than my potential earnings at the time, we wanted to have a family, and I wanted to have a family life.Â  That wasn't possible so long as both of us were working in highly competitive, stressful jobs.Â Â  For me, living a full life isn't about the money, or the adrenaline.Â Â The skills I learned while working on Wall Street were invaluable, and to some extent, transferable.Â  Selling yourself, getting people to trust you, and making the client feel good about themselves has a lot to do with success in business.Â  I learned how to do that with my co-workers and supervisors as well as with clients, on Wall Street.The real secret of success on Wall Street, as almost anything, is to persevere and consistently add value; and find a place and space that welcomes you, recognizes your contribution, and treats you with the respect that you deserve.Â  There are some incredible female role models on Wall Street;Â  they are extraordinarily talented, hard-working, and lucky, and often have made significant personal sacrifices.Â Â  There are companies that have a culture that supports and foster talent, no matter gender.Â  There are many sacrifices you make throughout your career, no matter what your gender is.Â  What's acceptable and fun at one point in your life might not be so positive, later on; and vice-versa.Â  Things change.Â  And maybe, patterns of sexual harassment and discrimination on Wall Street have changed for the better, too; but maybe they've just gone further underground.

flickr: brewbrooksA technician has many many tools. But what a lot of people fail to realize is that all of these are just a supplement to the most important thing we have, which is price. Over the past few months Iâ€™ve received a bunch of emails and comments questioning the significance of Fibonacci numbers and people asking me to explain how I use it as a tool. So letâ€™s start with how the Fibonacci Sequence was first discovered. Liber Abacci, first published in the year 1202, was a book on arithmetic written by Leonardo of Pisa. We know him today as Leonardo Fibonacci. In the book, a problem is posed that first gave rise to this sequence of numbers: 1,1, 2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144, and so on to infinity. The problem was this: How many pairs of rabbits placed in an enclosed area can be produced in a single year from one pair of rabbits if each pair gives birth to a new pair each month starting with the second month. From Elliott Wave Principle: â€œIn arriving at the solution, we find that each pair, including the first pair, needs a monthâ€™s time to mature. But one in production, begets a new pair each month. The number of pairs is the same at the beginning of each of the first two months, so the sequence is 1, 1. This first pair finally doubles its number during the second month, so that there are two pairs at the beginning of the third month. Of these, the older pair begets a third pair the following month so that at the beginning of the fourth month, the sequence expands 1,1,2,3. Of these three, the two older pairs reproduce, but not the youngest pair, so the number of rabbit pairs expands to five. The next month, three pairs reproduce so the sequence expands to five. The next month, three pairs reproduce so the sequence expands to 1,1,2,3,5,8 and so forth.â€ So basically the sum of any two adjacent numbers in the sequence forms the next higher number in the sequence: 1 plus 1 equals 2, 1 plus 2 equals 3, 2 plus 3 equals 5, 3 plus 5 equals 8, and so on to infinity. Why is this important? Well after the first several numbers in the sequence, the ratio of any number to the next one higher is approximately .618 to 1 and to the next lower number approximately 1.1618 to 1. The further along the sequence, the closer the ratio approaches 0.618 (or 61.8%). Between alternate numbers in the sequence, the ratio is approximately .382, whose inverse is 2.618. How do we use these numbers to our advantage? Well, we find them all around us everyday in nature. From the sizes of our arms relative to our torso, to the construction of Hurricanes, to Rams horns and even in our DNA. The more you dig into it, the more amazing this phenomenon becomes. But regardless of all that, the market cares. So we care. Go back to the market lows after the crash of 1987 and see where the 2009 bottom was after correcting from the 2007 top. Amazing stuff. When markets are trending and a correction comes, and I mean any market: stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies, they tend to stop at certain levels before resuming the underlying trend. These levels are 38.2% and 61.8% of the previous move higher (or lower in a downtrend). We see this time and time again. But weâ€™re not just buying because weâ€™re at a Fibonacci level, itâ€™s when these levels coincide with former support and resistance areas that it really becomes valuable. As I mentioned in paragraph 1, sentence 2 of this post, Fibonacci is just a supplement to price like everything else. If price says you have a good risk/reward AND youâ€™re at a key Fibonacci level, I pay more attention, and will probably put on bigger size. Throw in a momentum divergence and maybe some sentiment extremes and you could have a home run trade. Here is a good example of the Nasdaq100 finding support in April near 38.2% of the rally that started in November, before resuming its uptrend:  Fibonacci also comes into play when weâ€™re at levels never seen before by a market. Weâ€™ve had this dilemma throughout the year as S&amp;Ps were breaking out to all-time highs and weâ€™ve had nothing to refer to in the past because we had never been up there. What I like to do then is take the most recent correction in the market, and once we breakout to new highs, figure out what the 1.618% and 2.618% extensions of that prior move would be to come up with an area of potential supply. You can use that level to take profits or even put on a short, if thatâ€™s what youâ€™re into. Hereâ€™s a good example:  And these are the 2 biggest ways that I use Fibonacci. But thatâ€™s just me personally. I also get asked a lot whether I prefer to use absolute highs and lows or closing prices. The answer is I use both. You can see in the example above that Regional Banks ($KRE) could barely hang on to the 161.8% level and was barely able to exceed it to run into the 2.618% extension of closing prices. I thought that cluster of extensions was interesting. Time is a big factor as well. I know some smart guys that use the Fibonacci sequence in their cycle work and has helped them spot key turning points in the market. Like anything else in life, I canâ€™t use every tool and indicator that we have at our disposal. But feel free to dig deep and see how Fibonacci can help you. Everyone is different. But I thought I would share how it helps me. Hereâ€™s to our boy Leo Fibonacci, one of the great mathematicians in history.

Twitter.com/aswatchdamodaranAswath Damodaran, NYU's legendary finance professor who predicted the top in Apple, and the bottom for Facebook, has just unveiled his fair price for Tesla.Â  The stock has been on a tear, surging over 400% since the beginning of the year to $170.62, its closing price on Wednesday. But in a new blog post, the valuation guru thinks Tesla is worth just $67.12 today. Using "standard metrics the company seems overvalued," he wrote. Of course he does point out that with companies as young as Tesla, we shouldÂ  derive value not from earnings and revenue today, but expectations for these in the future. Here are Damodaran's assumptions for his current valuation: Aswath Damodara/Musings On Markets So what's Damodaran's "bottom-line"? For a young company to mature it has to 1) grow revenues, 2) start posting profits, 3) generate enough money for reinvestment. "I am assuming all of these at Tesla but my estimated value per share of $67.12 is well below the market price of $168.76." He reiterates his assumptions are very optimistic. Earlier today he tweeted, "Assuming Tesla grows to have Audi-like revenues ($67 b) &amp; Porsche-like margins (12.5%), I can't get past $70/sh." You can see Damodaran's valuation spreadsheet here. 
Because of the lack of ports along the Arctic shores, and tight beam and draught limits for vessels to navigate the eastern Laptev and Sannikov narrows, ten new Russian navigational and emergency centres will be installed over the next decade to bring the new traffic under Russian supervision and regulation. But there are technical problems with the maintenance of hundreds of strontium-90 powered navigational beacons installed along the coast line. Customs, coast guard, and special forces units are also being reinforced and tested to give the Russian regulatory authorities teeth to react to what the Kremlin considers foreign territorial or commercial threats. Ironically, according to one Moscow source, the satellite imaging used by the Russians to identify and navigate around thick ice concentrations is Canadian, not Russian. Decrees issued by former President Dmitry Medvedev and President Vladimir Putin have ordered state funding for three new nuclear-powered icebreakers, built according to new designs by the Iceberg Bureau of St. Petersburg. The first, already under way at Baltic Shipyard in St. Petersburg, will be ready by 2017; the second and third by 2020. The federal ministry of Finance is planning to spend Rb100 billion ($3.1 billion). After the US and Germany tried, then abandoned their efforts to create comparable nuclear-powered icebreakers, Stanislaus Golovinsky says Russia now has an â€œabsolute monopolyâ€ on this segment of shipbuilding and operation; Golovinsky is Deputy Director General of Rosatomflot, the state agency in charge of the new icebreaker fleet. Japan operates the nuclear-powered Mutsu icebreaker, but it is no more than a research vessel. China tested the route with the Xue Long, a diesel-powered icebreaker, a year ago. It wasnâ€™t until 2008 that Rosatomflot was put in charge of the nuclear-power icebreakers, after more than a decade of semi-commercial icebreaking by the Murmansk Shipping Company. The new Russian vessels will replace the five icebreakers currently available for the Northern Sea Route. Unlike diesel powered vessels, however, the nuclear ones arenâ€™t limited in range or operation by the need to make port for refueling. According to a recent study by the Arctic Institute, an American-backed think-tank without Russian participation, â€œthe ice-free period along the Arcticâ€™s main shipping routes is expected to increase from around 30 days in 2010 to more than 120 days by the middle of the century.â€ Not since Operation Wunderland of 1942, a German Navy operation to attack and sink Russian convoys moving east and westward through the Northern Sea Route, has there been so much planned vessel movement through the Arctic seas. The perception of potentially hostile or competitive foreign threats in the region spurred the Kremlin and the State Duma to enact new legislation last year, establishing the Northern Sea Route Administration, and following with new regulations and new charges covering foreign vessel navigation, vessel to shore communication, weather and hydrological services, icebreaker operations, rescue and spill response. The Northern Sea Route Administration opened for business in Moscow in March of this year. Its new rules require vessels applying for permits to transit the route to accept Russian icebreaker assistance, which is determined by whether ice conditions at voyage time are judged to be heavy, medium or light. Russian maritime statistics indicate that in 2012 46 vessels sailed through the Northern Sea Route. They carried about 2 million tonnes of cargo; this compares with 7 million tonnes in 1987, the peak volume during the Soviet period. There was almost nothing when Boris Yeltsin took over the presidency in the 1990s. Slightly more than half these vessels sailed eastwards compared to those moving in the opposite direction. Petroleum product cargoes still dominate, compared to bulk iron-ore, fish or ballast. For the first time last year cargoes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Norway were transported eastwards, while one Norwegian product tanker set the record at 66,462 tonnes of jet fuel on the route eastwards from South Korea to Finland. On the westwards route, the Dynagas gas carrier,Ob River, delivered a record 84,682 tonnes of LNG to Tobata, in Japan, in May 2012. It is worth noting for comparison that in 2012 through the Suez Canal 17,225 vessels made the passage, carryingÂ 928.5 million tonnesÂ of cargo. The first Chinese cargo vessel to transport containerized cargo westwards through the Northern Sea Route is currently under way; Coscoâ€™s Yong Sheng is enroute from Dalian to Rotterdam between August 27 and September 11. The latest data from the Northern Sea Route Administration indicate that as of August 23, this year, the number of vessels making the complete transit voyage was only 16, carrying 433,000 tonnes of cargo â€“ significantly less than a year ago. Vessel applications for operating permits in the area currently number 547; permits granted, 467, indicating a refusal rate of 15%. When Novatekâ€™s LNG refinery starts operating on the Yamal peninsula in 2017, and LNG shipments commence eastwards and westwards from the new Kara Sea port of Sabetta, a new fleet of 16 LNG carriers will depend on the Russian icebreakers to move more than 16 million tonnes per annum of LNG; the tankers will each have a rated capacity of 150,000 tonnes. Russian experts told Fairplay there may be as much as a billion tonnes of fuel to be lifted and shipped in the Arctic region â€“ without Russian icebreakers, though, it is bound to stay where it is. The Russian government agency in charge of Arctic emergencies, including oil spills, is called Gosmorspassluzhba (â€œState Marine Emergency Serviceâ€). Deputy director Andrei Haustov told Fairplay the agency doesnâ€™t monitor oil spill risks, but is called into action when they happen. Seismic risks, he added, also threaten to breach oil and gas pipelines which are being laid on the Arctic seabed. At a conference last month [August] he acknowledged that his agency needed to â€œstrengthen preparedness to deal with oil spills both from the Ministry of Transport of Russia, as well as [from] oil companies engaged in exploration, extraction, processing, transportation and storage of oil, in terms of whether they have enough equipment for oil spill response.â€ Vladimir Chuprov, head of the Russian Greenpeace energy programme, told Fairplay there is a conflict between the oil and gas companies and the Northern Sea Route Administration and Atomflot. The companies want to keep the price of the nuclear icebreakers down to a minimum, and pay only for the time the vessels are in use. By contrast, the route and fleet bureaucrats who are starved of state budget money want to lift the icebreaker, navigation, and security charges, adding possibly an all-year-round access fee for operators, as is the practice in Scandinavia. â€œOn the one hand, there are the oil and gas projects for which this costly state presence has been created,â€ Chuprov says. â€œAnd on the other, there are the commercial interests. They contradict each other, and for the time being the oil and gas interests are prevailing.â€ In August, the Northern Sea Route Administration refused to issue a transit permit for the Greenpeace vessel, icebreaker Arctic Sunrise, on grounds that it lacked the required ice classification. According to Greenpeace, the regulations are being manipulated to prevent Greenpeaceâ€™s protest against Russian and other oil company exploration in Arctic waters. A Greenpeace statement claims: â€œNone of the six oil exploration vessels operating for Rosneft and ExxonMobil in the area has an ice classification as high as the Arctic Sunrise. More than 400 vessels have been granted access to the Northern Sea Route this year, many of them with an inferior classification to that of the Arctic Sunrise, which is classed as an icebreaker.â€ Greenpeace is considering charging the Russian regulators with violating â€œRussiaâ€™s obligation under Article 58 of the Law of the Sea Convention to allow foreign vessels freedom of navigation in its Exclusive Economic Zone, and its obligations under Articles 10 and 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights to refrain from unjustified interferences with freedom of expression and peaceful assembly.â€ The Russian Coast Guard has claimed the right to impose a 4-mile exclusion zone around a Rosneft oil exploration vessel to prevent an approach by the Arctic Sunrise. â€œThe environmental standards that exist today in Russia are catastrophically low,â€ Chuprov says for Greenpeace. â€œThat is, they do not encourage companies to behave in what is called an â€˜environmentally friendlyâ€™ fashion.â€ Chuprov also warns that Russia is running a much bigger risk in the Arctic than there will be oil profits to justify the state outlays and subsidies. According to Greenpeace calculations, by the year 2025 the Russian government expects that the Arctic shelf projects now in planning will be able to produce 13.5 million tonnes of oil. But in terms of aggregate Russian oil production elsewhere on the continent, that would amount to just 3%. According to Chuprov, there is a serious risk that for all of the special subsidies and tax incentives to encourage Arctic shelf oil projects, the price of oil may not justify the state budget outlays and tax losses. And if thatâ€™s the risk facing the oil and gas companies, all the other costs of the Northern Sea Route may turn out to be too high, too uncertain, too risky after all.

Here's an incredible chart that shows how rapidly solar power is being installed in America. In 2006, just 7 years ago, there was one new installation of a solar unit every 80 minutes. Today? There's one installation every four minutes. The U.S. is on pace to see one new solar installation every 83 seconds by 2016, renewable energy research group Greentech Media says. GreenTechMedia Perhaps even more amazing:Â two-thirds of all "distributed," or localized, solar in the U.S. has been installed in the past 2 1/2 years. Greentech VP Shayle Kann told us that by 2016, New Jersey will have surged to the No. 2 solar producer in the country, leapfrogging Arizona. Meanwhile, New York will surge from 10th to 5th, thanks to its renewable portfolio standard that dictates 29% of all the state's energy needs must be renewably sourced by 2015.

The euro is making an ugly downward move right now. This comes as ECB President Mario Draghi gives his live post-policy meeting press conference. "The risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area continue to be on the downside," he said. Here's a look at the euro against the dollar via FinViz: Finviz
European Parliament / FlickrECB President Mario Draghi is giving a live press conference right now, reiterating that the central bank's monetary stance is "geared toward" accommodation. The ECB will keep rates at their record lows for an extended period as the Euro area begins to recover, he said. Draghi said that confidence indicators confirmed improvements in growth across the continent. "The overall improvement in financial markets since last summer seem to be gradually working their way through the real economy," he said. Draghi also raised GDP projections in 2013 to -0.4% (up from -0.6%), and lowered 2014 GDP projections to 1.0% from 1.1%. "Inflation expectations for the euro area continue to be firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term," he said. In terms of the European recovery, Draghi qualified that the "shoots are still very green." Here is Draghi's entire statement: Ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. I will now report on the outcome of today’s meeting of the Governing Council. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the  key ECB interest rates unchanged. Incoming information and analysis have further underpinned our previous assessment. Underlying price pressures in the euro area are expected to remain subdued over the medium term. In keeping with this picture, monetary and, in particular, credit dynamics remain subdued. Inflation expectations for the euro area continue to be firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. At the same time, real GDP growth in the second quarter was positive, after six quarters of negative output growth, and confidence indicators up to August confirm the expected gradual improvement in economic activity from low levels. Our monetary policy stance continues to be geared towards maintaining the degree of monetary accommodation warranted by the outlook for price stability and promoting stable money market conditions. It thereby provides support to a gradual recovery in economic activity. Looking ahead, our monetary policy stance will remain accommodative for as long as necessary, in line with the forward guidance provided in July. The Governing Council confirms that it expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time. This expectation continues to be based on an unchanged overall subdued outlook for inflation extending into the medium term, given the broad-based weakness in the economy and subdued monetary dynamics. In the period ahead, we will monitor all incoming information on economic and monetary developments and assess any impact on the medium-term outlook for price stability. With regard to money market conditions, these have also been influenced by a gradual reduction in excess liquidity. Repayments of funds taken up in the context of the three-year longer-term refinancing operations reflect improvements in financial market confidence, some reduction in financial market fragmentation and the ongoing deleveraging by euro area banks. We will remain particularly attentive to the implications that these developments may have for the stance of monetary policy. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Following six quarters of negative output growth, euro area real GDP rose, quarter on quarter, by 0.3% in the second quarter of 2013. This increase is partly explained by transitory effects related to weather conditions in the first half of this year. Since then, survey-based confidence indicators up to August have improved further from low levels, overall confirming our previous expectations of a gradual recovery in economic activity. Looking ahead to the remainder of the year and to 2014, in line with our baseline scenario, output is expected to recover at a slow pace, in particular owing to a gradual improvement in domestic demand supported by the accommodative monetary policy stance. Euro area economic activity should, in addition, benefit from a gradual strengthening of external demand for exports. Furthermore, the overall improvements in financial markets seen since last summer appear to be gradually working their way through to the real economy, as should the progress made in fiscal consolidation. In addition, real incomes have benefited recently from generally lower inflation. This being said, unemployment in the euro area remains high, and the necessary balance sheet adjustments in the public and private sectors will continue to weigh on economic activity. This assessment is also reflected in the September 2013 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual real GDP declining by 0.4% in 2013 and increasing by 1.0% in 2014. Compared with the June 2013 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the projection for 2013 has been revised upwards by 0.2 percentage point, largely reflecting incoming data. For 2014 there has been a downward revision of 0.1 percentage point.  The risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area continue to be on the downside. Recent developments in global money and financial market conditions and related uncertainties may have the potential to negatively affect economic conditions. Other downside risks include higher commodity prices in the context of renewed geopolitical tensions, weaker than expected global demand and slow or insufficient implementation of structural reforms in euro area countries. According to Eurostat’s flash estimate, as expected, euro area annual HICP inflation was 1.3% in August 2013, down from 1.6% in June and July. On the basis of current assumptions for energy and exchange rate developments, annual inflation rates are expected to remain low in the coming months, owing in particular to energy price developments. Taking the appropriate medium-term perspective, underlying price pressures are expected to remain subdued, reflecting the broad-based weakness in aggregate demand and the modest pace of the recovery. Medium to long-term inflation expectations continue to be firmly anchored in line with price stability. This assessment is also reflected in the September 2013 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP inflation at 1.5% in 2013 and 1.3% in 2014. In comparison with the June 2013 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the projection for inflation for 2013 has been revised upwards by 0.1 percentage point, while the projection for 2014 remains unchanged. The risks to the outlook for price developments are expected to be still broadly balanced over the medium term, with upside risks relating in particular to higher commodity prices as well as stronger than expected increases in administered prices and indirect taxes, and downside risks stemming from weaker than expected economic activity. Turning to the monetary analysis, data for July confirm that underlying broad money (M3) and, in particular, credit growth remained subdued. Annual growth in M3 decreased further in July to 2.2%, from 2.4% in June. Annual growth in M1 remained strong but decreased to 7.1% in July, from 7.5% in June. M3 growth continued to be mainly supported by net capital inflows into the euro area, while the annual rate of change of loans to the private sector weakened further. The annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) remained at 0.3% in July, broadly unchanged since the turn of the year. The annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) was -2.8% in July, compared with -2.3% in June. Weak loan dynamics continue to reflect primarily the current stage of the business cycle, heightened credit risk and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. Since the summer of 2012 substantial progress has been made in improving the funding situation of banks and, in particular, in strengthening the domestic deposit base in a number of stressed countries. In order to ensure an adequate transmission of monetary policy to the financing conditions in euro area countries, it is essential that the fragmentation of euro area credit markets declines further and that the resilience of banks is strengthened where needed. Further decisive steps to establish a banking union will help to accomplish this objective. To sum up, the economic analysis indicates that price developments should remain in line with price stability over the medium term. A  cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms this picture. In order to further reduce imbalances and to foster competitiveness, growth and job creation, euro area countries need to continue with their reform agenda. As regards fiscal policies, governments should not unravel their efforts to reduce deficits and put debt ratios on a downward path. The composition of fiscal consolidation should be geared towards growth-friendly measures which have a medium-term perspective and combine improving the quality and efficiency of public services with minimising distortionary effects of taxation. In terms of economic policies, product market reforms to increase competitiveness will facilitate the creation of new businesses, support the tradable goods sector and foster job creation, while high unemployment rates require decisive structural reforms to reduce rigidities in labour markets and to increase labour demand. I am now at your disposal for questions. 
bytemarks / FlickrThe Department of Labor's latest report on weekly unemployment insurance claims is out. Claims dropped to 323,000 from 332,000 a week ago. Economists were looking for a reading of 330,000. "[T]he fact that jobless claims have been consistently below 350kâ€”a key level that has been commensurate with 200kplusnonfarm payroll growth in the pastâ€”bodes well for Fridayâ€™s report," said Deutsche Bank's Brett Ryan in a note before the release. Today's number was just a hair about 322,000, the level reached three weeks ago, which was also the lowest level since January 2008. The four-week moving average has fallen to 328,500, down from 331,500 a week ago. This is the lowest level since October 2007.
DeGolyer Library, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, Texas The ADP jobs report came in at just 176K. That'sÂ  slightly below the 184 that was expected by economists. And it's below the 198K that we saw last month. This isn't a horrible number of anything, but it's still kind of meh. Tomorrow's official Non-Farm Payrolls report is going to be huge, as it could strongly influence the Fed decision coming up in just a few days. The full report is here.

And US 10-year rates are up to 2.95%, which is a new high for the recent cycle. The debate about whether this is the result of "tapering" fears or mere normalization after the crisis-inspired plunge inr ates is something others can debate.

REUTERS/John GressNew York Yankees Alex Rodriguez heads back to the dugout after being called out in the seventh inning while playing the Chicago White Sox in their American League MLB baseball game in Chicago, August 7, 2013. Titled "Seventh Inning Stretch," Bill Gross's September Investment Outlook to PIMCO clients is riddled with baseball analogies. But what's somewhat surprising was his tirade against the sport. This is interesting because we know that PIMCO CEO Mohamed El-Erian is a big Mets fan. From Gross's note: Having mentioned Jack and the game of baseball, let me give you some opinions that come close to being hard cold facts, not wishes. First of all, baseball is the most boring game in the world next to cricket. I donâ€™t know how to play cricket, which is the only reason I rank it second. CNN Sports did an actual survey of how much time during an average two hour and 39 minute game that baseball players are actually moving â€“ you know, swinging a bat or running to first base. Five minutes and 13 seconds! The rest of the time the boys of summer are actually just standing around, scratching you know where, and spitting tobacco juice onto the nice green grass. Most disgusting, Iâ€™d say. And why, I wonder, does a baseball â€œseasonâ€ consist of 162 individually boring games? In football you only need 16 or so to declare a champion, in boxing sometimes three minutes or less. Now for some controversy: steroids, HGH and juicinâ€™? I say, why not. They canâ€™t be cheating if theyâ€™re all cheating together. And as a matter of fact, management and owners â€œcheatâ€ all the time. If they have a lineup heavy with left-handed hitters, they will shorten the right field fence. The Yankees and now the Dodgers just â€œbuyâ€ championships with money from the gameâ€™s most gargantuan TV rights (whoâ€™s watching?). Thatâ€™s playing by the rules? If your counterpoint on drugs is that itâ€™s unnatural and harmful to the body, I wonder whatâ€™s so healthy about the way they conduct spring training or do their pregame warm-ups. Two or three half-hearted sprints in the outfield and theyâ€™re done. If baseball was concerned about health or addiction, theyâ€™d be testing for lip cancer or diabetes. Modern day relief pitchers, who now â€œexerciseâ€ for two innings or less on the mound, have pot bellies that would make a sumo wrestler proud. Why, the Babe was so fat he could hardly waddle back around to home plate 60 times in one season. Last point, because I know youâ€™re dying to hear my opinion on Pete Rose and the Hall of Fame. I say anyone as ugly as Pete deserves a free pass to Cooperstown or any town for that matter, maybe the same free pass that youâ€™d have to give me to go to a baseball game again. Take me anywhere, but donâ€™t take me out to the ball game and make me stretch during the seventh inning while Iâ€™m eating my Cracker Jacks. Reality can smack you in the face sometimes, like it did Pete Rose, but if Iâ€™m gonna be smacked itâ€™ll have to be on the gridiron or the hardwood, not Yankee Stadium. Of course, no one could accuse El-Erian's Mets of "buying" championships. Anyways, it's not too hard to imagine what kind of parallels Gross draws to the economy and financial system. Fast-forward to his recommendations (emphasis added): So what to do here, folks? For those of you who are still fans of the old American pastime â€“ in this case capitalism and the making of money as opposed to baseball â€“ how do you play on this rather unstable field of our own making? Which pitch do you swing at? Well, commonsensically, in an unstable global economy that is increasingly difficult to stabilize, an investor should seek out the most stable of assets. At the extreme, that would be cash in the worldâ€™s most stable currency. But whether dollars, euros, or pounds be your first choice (ours being dollars), cash or overnight deposits in any of them yield next to nothing. So say you want something but donâ€™t want to lose your money either; a modern day Will Rogers. More concerned about the return of your money than on your money but still a little greedy (or perhaps just needy) too. Well, some say stocks â€“ the only game in town. But I donâ€™t know. When the Fed stops the QE game, it seems that stocks might be at risk. After all, havenâ€™t they more than doubled in price since 2009 in part because of it? Without Big Government deficits and Big Bank check writing and with the advancing risks posed by Big Regulation and the technical whimsy of Big Investor, the safest pitch to swing at may not be stocks but the asset that will soon be the nearly sole focus of central banks. Instead of QE, central bankers are shifting to â€œforward guidanceâ€ which, if reliable, allows financial markets and real economies to plan several years forward in terms of financing rates and investment returns. If unemployment and inflation rates can be at least closely guesstimated, then front-end yields become the most reliable bet in the ballpark, Pete Rose notwithstanding. While low, they can at least form the basis for curve rolldown and volatility strategies that have higher return/risk ratios than alternative carry options such as duration, credit or currency. With Big Investor unsure or perhaps unable to catch stock, long bond or currency fly balls in todayâ€™s afternoon sun, itâ€™s perhaps best to field boring slow-rolling grounders based on policy rate stability for â€œan extended period of time.â€ Recall as well that the result of Minskyâ€™s â€œBig Governmentâ€ and â€œBig Bankâ€ policies has always been accelerating inflation at some future time. We recommend longer-dated TIPS as insurance against just such an outcome. Read Gross's entire outlook at PIMCO.com.
cinemafestival / Shutterstock.com AustralianÂ billionaireÂ businessmanÂ Clive Palmer, whose Palmer United Party (PUP) is running in the upcoming federal election, said on Thursday (September 5) he intended to sueÂ Rupert Murdoch's newspaper, The Australian. Palmer said he was suing Murdoch over an article which questions Palmer's claims of wealth, being a mining magnate and a university professor, and whether voters should enable Palmer to gain "great political power," local media said. "Rupert MurdochÂ will be sued by me today and he'll be brought toÂ AustraliaÂ to answer these questions in theSupreme Court. It's time that this fellow was brought to account, this foreigner that tries to dictate what we do," Palmer said on theÂ Seven Network's Sunrise programme. The broadsheet is backing conservative opposition leaderÂ Tony AbbottÂ to win the election and said it had spent months examining Palmer's track record. Palmer also appeared on theÂ Nine Network's Today Show and accused Murdoch's estranged wife, Wendy Deng, of being a spy forÂ China. "You know,Â Rupert Murdoch's wife,Â Wendi Deng, is a Chinese spy and that's been right across the world. She's been spying on Rupert for years giving money back toÂ Chinese intelligence. Read the truth about it. She was trained inÂ southern China. I'm telling you the truth.Â Wendi DengÂ is a Chinese spy, that's whyÂ Rupert MurdochÂ got rid of her, and that's the truth. This guy wants to control Australian politics," Palmer told Today Show host,Â Karl Stephanovic. Palmer has predicted that his PUP will win 10 seats in Saturday's (September 7) election, local media reported. 

Sadik Gulec / Shutterstock.comIt's no surprise that one of the ugliest charts of the day would belong to an Emerging Market. The Turkish lira is getting slammed, falling more than 1% a record low. Turkey is one of a handful of Emerging Market's whose massive current account deficits have currency traders running for the exits. Here's the WSJ's Yeliz Candemir on new Bank of Turkey comments: Turkey's currency previously hit a record low of TRY2.0733 against the dollar last week after Governor Erdem Basci ruled out rate increases even as he said officials would defend the lira "like lions," forecasting it would be up to TRY1.92 against the dollar by year end. The central bank had appeared to back away from this position Wednesday when Deputy Governor Turalay Kenc was quoted as saying: "The exchange rate at year end may be below or above that level," by several economists who attended a monthly analysts' meeting.

REUTERS/Mikhail KireevChina's Vice Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao attends a briefing at the G20 Summit in Strelna near St. Petersburg, September 5, 2013.ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (Reuters) - China warned on Thursday that military intervention in Syria would hurt the world economy and push up oil prices, reinforcing Vladimir Putin's attempts to talk U.S. President Barack Obama out of air strikes. The rift over Syria could overshadow a summit of the Group of 20 (G20) developed and developing economies in St. Petersburg at which global leaders want to forge a united front on growth, trade, banking transparency and fighting tax evasion. The club that accounts for two thirds of the world's population and 90 percent of its output is divided over issues such as turmoil in emerging markets and the Federal Reserve's decision to end its program of stimulus for the U.S. economy. But no rift is wider than the one between the U.S. and Russian leaders on possible military intervention in Syria to punish President Bashar al-Assad over a chemical weapons attack that killed hundreds of people on August 21. Putin was isolated on Syria at a Group of Eight meeting in June, the last big meeting of world powers, but now has China to back him at the G20 summit in Russia's former imperial capital. "Military action would have a negative impact on the global economy, especially on the oil price - it will cause a hike in the oil price," Chinese Vice Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao told a briefing before the start of the G20 leaders' talks. In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei reiterated that any party resorting to chemical warfare should accept responsibility for it but said unilateral military actions violate international law and would complicate the conflict. Like Moscow, one of Syria's main arms suppliers, Beijing has veto powers on the United Nations Security Council. Obama is unlikely to win Security Council approval for military action but is seeking the approval of the U.S. Congress. France echoed Obama's call for action over the gas attack, which Washington blames on Syrian government troops and Moscow says may have been carried out by rebels trying to oust Assad. "The position of France is to punish and negotiate," Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius told France 2 television before travelling to St. Petersburg, where Putin is hosting the summit in a tsarist palace on the coast. "We are convinced that if there is no punishment for Mr. Assad, there will be no negotiation," he added. "Punishment will allow negotiation, but obviously it will be difficult." Fabius, whose country is preparing to support the U.S. military action with own forces, said Syria would be discussed at the summit even though it is not formally on the agenda. Putin has said he would like to hold one-on-one talks with Obama but a Kremlin spokesman said no such meeting was planned. Last month, Obama pulled out of talks with Putin that had been scheduled for Wednesday, and U.S.-Russian ties are in freefall. Foreign ministers from key states in the G20 - which includes all five permanent U.N. Security Council members - will also discuss Syria on the sidelines of the meeting. Any G20 decision on Syria would not be binding but Putin would like to see a consensus to avert military action in what would be a significant - but unlikely - personal triumph. Obama used a visit to Sweden on Wednesday to build his case for a military response, saying: "The international community's credibility is on the line." Putin increased the volume as well, accusing Secretary of State John Kerry of "lying" by playing down the role of the militant group al Qaeda with rebel forces. LOSS OF HARMONY The G20 achieved unprecedented cooperation between developed and emerging nations to stave off economic collapse during the 2009 financial crisis, but the harmony has now gone. There are likely to be some agreements - including on measures to fight tax evasion by multinational companies - at the summit in the spectacular, 18th-century Peterhof palace complex, built on the orders of Tsar Peter the Great. An initiative will be presented to leaders on refining regulation of the $630-trillion global market for financial derivatives to prevent a possible markets blow-up. Steps to give the so-called 'shadow banking' sector until 2015 to comply with new global rules will also be discussed. But consensus is proving hard to achieve among developed economies as the United States takes aggressive action to spur demand and Europe moves more slowly to let go of austerity. Meanwhile, emerging economies in the BRICS countries - Brazil, Russia, China and South Africa - are divided over the role of the U.S. dollar in the world economy. And there has been no sign of them rallying behind the fifth BRICS member, India, after it called on Friday for joint currency intervention. Russia and China also joined forces in warning about the potential impact of the Fed ending its bond-buying program to stimulate the economy. Zhu urged the United States to be "mindful of the spillover effects and work to contribute to the stability of the global financial markets and the steady recovery of the global economy". The International Monetary Fund will call at the meeting for strengthened global action to revitalize growth and better manage risks, according to an IMF document seen by Reuters. But with the United States and other advanced economies picking up speed, the IMF said it still expected global growth to accelerate in 2014 from this year, helped by the highly accommodative monetary conditions in the rich world. Further friction on the fringes of the summit could be caused by Obama's plans to meet human rights activists including members of a gay rights group which staged protests against a law Putin signed banning "gay propaganda" among children.

The markets were most focused on an impending military strike on Syria last week. While prospects for an imminent strike have faded, the likelihood of military action in the near future remains. Unfortunately, the past offers us many periods of military action. Looking back at these can help us draw parallels and gain perspective on the most likely outcome for the markets. Although the circumstances surrounding prior conflicts have been varied, investors have experienced the same emotional response and, as a result, the markets yielded a similar outcome. Most military conflicts have prompted a common pattern in the stock market: impending war acted as a negative from when the United States committed to action until action began; once action began, markets rebounded. The rebound can come quickly, as it did in WWII when Doolittleâ€™s raid in April 1942 retaliating for the December 1941 Pearl Harbor attack turned stocks higher despite a war that lingered for years. The buildup to the Korean War caused a sharp market drop in mid-1950, but losses were quickly reversed as soon as U.S. troops were engaged. In recent decades, the pattern changed slightly, with the stock market bottoming and starting to recover ahead of the military strike [Figure 1]. Examples include: LPL Financial LPL Financial The historical pattern suggests that if a strike on Syria begins soon, then the S&amp;P 500 may have bottomed last week after a 4.6% pullback from its peak on August 2, 2013. However, this stock market pullback began well before the August 21, 2013 chemical attack and has more to do with domestic economic and policy concerns than with foreign policy. Instead, the outlook for economic and profit growth, along with the potential for volatility related to the Federal Reserve (Fed) tapering its bond-buying program and the fiscal fights in Washington, are likely to again take precedence in the minds of investors. This weekâ€™s economic reports, including the widely watched Institute for Supply Management (ISM) manufacturing report on September 3 and the employment report on September 6, provide important data points on the Fedâ€™s decision whether to begin tapering this month. On the fiscal front, the continuing resolution funding the federal government runs out at the end of this month, and the debt ceiling is likely to be hit in mid-October with Congress jointly scheduled to be in session only nine days in September. The combination of factors may contribute to another volatile month for investors in the stock market. It can be a challenge for investors to remain disciplined in an environment of economic uncertainty and military conflict, especially after the long trek back to even for many investors after the steep losses suffered in the financial crisis of five years ago. We do not think this is a time to sell or that investors need to fear a major stock market decline. Instead, we continue to believe investors should expect these 5â€“10% pullbacks more frequently as part of a return to normal market volatility as the four-and-a-half year old bull market matures â€” but continues.
Yoshikazu Tsuno/AFPFishmongers inspect bluefin tuna at Tokyo's Tsukiji fish market on January 5, 2013Asia-Pacific fishing nations and territories agreed on Thursday to cut catches of young bluefin tuna by 15 percent, with an agreement environmentalists said would not stop overfishing. Nine economies, including the United States, China, South Korea and Taiwan, concluded a four-day meeting of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) in Fukuoka, western Japan. The participants agreed to reduce the amount of bluefin tuna aged three years or younger in 2014 by 15 percent of the average between 2002 and 2004, a Japanese fisheries agency official said. The United States had proposed a 25-percent reduction, but a majority of participants, concerned about the impact on local fishing industries, agreed on the 15-percent cut proposed by Japan, the official said. The accord will be endorsed at the commission's annual assembly in December in Australia, the official added. Greenpeace immediately denounced the reduction, saying only a total ban on catching bluefin tuna -- at least until a sign of clear recovery of the species can be confirmed -- was enough. Greenpeace also called on Japan -- the world's biggest consumer of tuna -- to take the lead in adopting effective measures "to assure the sustainability of fishing bluefin tuna in the Pacific". Environmentalists say industrial-scale fishing that takes large amounts of young tuna from the ocean before they are old enough to breed is destroying the population of a fish highly-prized in Japan's sushi restaurants. The WCPFC was formed in 2004 based on a UN treaty to conserve and manage tuna and other highly migratory fish stocks across the western and central areas of the Pacific. Copyright (2013) AFP.

Later today, we'll get monetary policy announcements from the Bank of England and the European Central Bank. "Unlike El Guapo with his plethora of pinatas, each filled with â€œlittle surprisesâ€, we are unlikely to find great surprises among the plethora of G10 central bank meetings today," wrote the currency analysts at Societe Generale this morning. "Given the upcoming Fed taper announcement (on 18 September), we expect Draghi to reiterate the ECB's forward guidance with reference to the possibility of lower rates," they added. 'He needs to keep a lid on peripheral bond yields. Although the EA is undergoing a recovery, money supply and credit growth remains weak and the disinflationary trend is still evident." Over in Asia, the Bank of Japan announced no change in its ongoing stimulus program. However, it raised its assessment of the economy, which now has experts thinking that a sales tax hike is on its way for the country. Japan's Nikkei closed barely above breakeven.

Reuters/Eric VidalJeroen DijsselbloemBRUSSELS (Reuters) - Greece's financial troubles will not end in 2014 and it is therefore realistic to expect the debt-laden country will need additional money from the euro zone before it can return to markets, the head of euro zone finance ministers said. International lenders estimate that Greece will need around 10-11 billion euros ($13.1-14.4 billion) from the second half of 2014 to keep it going next year and in 2015. But several euro zone governments are reluctant to extend any further loans because of negative public opinion, with voters tired of bailing out other countries after three years of the sovereign debt crisis. "As far as the potential need for a third program for Greece is concerned, it's clear that despite recent progress, Greece's troubles will not have been completely resolved by 2014," Jeroen Dijsselbloem told the European Parliament. "It is realistic to assume that additional support will be needed beyond the program. In this context, the Eurogroup has indicated clearly that it is committed to providing adequate support to Greece during the current program and beyond until it has regained market access," he said. Dijsselbloem, who is also Dutch finance minister, said that separately, once verified Greek public finance data for 2013 is available in April 2014, the euro zone may consider some further form of debt relief for Athens. "The Eurogroup agreed last year to consider additional measures if necessary, such as further reductions of the interest rates on Greek loan facilities... if Greece were to meet precise conditions," Dijsselbloem said. "We will not be any position to assess whether these conditions have been fully met until April next year," he said. (Reporting by Robin Emmott and Jan Strupczewski; editing by Charlie Dunmore)
REUTERS/Yuya ShinoA woman holding a wallet walks past an advertisement poster in the style of a traditional Japanese painting, outside a restaurant in Tokyo, September 5, 2013.TOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan declared the world's third-largest economy is recovering as it voted on Thursday to maintain its monetary stimulus, offering a more upbeat view than last month on growing signs the benefits of its expansionary policy are broadening. A slew of positive data has underscored the view that robust household spending and the feel-good mood generated by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's pro-growth policies are gradually prompting companies to increase capital spending and hiring. The BOJ's upgraded view may heighten the case for Abe to go ahead with a planned sales tax hike from next year, a move seen as necessary to start reining in Japan's huge public debt. As widely expected, the central bank voted unanimously to maintain its pledge of increasing base money, or cash and deposits at the central bank, at an annual pace of 60 trillion yen ($603 billion) to 70 trillion yen. "Japan's economy is recovering moderately," the BOJ said in a statement, revising up its assessment from August when it said the economy was "starting to recover moderately." The government is leaning toward raising the tax as planned from April and cushioning the impact with fiscal stimulus. The central bank may also come under pressure to act, although it is in no mood to ease pre-emptively to counter the expected drag on growth. "The BOJ's upgrade seems appropriate because revised GDP is likely to show that capital expenditure turned positive," said Shuji Tonouchi, senior fixed income strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. "Our main scenario is that the BOJ will ease again around the time of the first tax hike next year. There are risks from the Middle East and overseas economies, but if the BOJ eases again it will be for domestic reasons." ENCOURAGING DATA Japan emerged from recession in 2012 and data for much of this year has shown the benefits of Abe's reflationary policies and the BOJ's aggressive stimulus. Recent data have been particularly encouraging, with the jobless rate at the lowest in almost five years, summer bonuses increasing and core consumer prices rising at the fastest pace in nearly five years. Finance ministry data on Monday also showed a healthy increase in corporate capital spending, pointing to a sharp upward revision to second-quarter GDP data due next week from a preliminary 2.6 percent expansion. That gives advocates of the tax hike ammunition to counter the views of opponents that Japan should delay or water down the tax increases to prevent the economy from faltering again. Unless Abe changes the plan, the sales tax will be raised to 8 percent from 5 percent in April and to 10 percent in October 2015. He will decide early next month, taking into account the BOJ's "tankan" business sentiment survey due on October 1. The BOJ has consistently called for the need to fix Japan's tattered finances and has argued that the sales tax hikes won't threaten the economic recovery or delay an end to deflation. At a post-meeting news conference, BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda may reiterate the need to keep up efforts to restore fiscal health and argue that any damage from the expected sales tax hike could be overcome without additional monetary stimulus. Central bankers say they are ready to ease again if risks to growth exceed their expectations and derail the path toward achieving 2 percent inflation in two years. But that does not mean the BOJ will automatically act in response to the government's decision to raise tax, they say.
