NEW YORK (AP) ó David Rubenstein gave millions to repair the Washington Monument after a 2011 earthquake left cracks in the stone obelisk. He hopes a fractured Congress can fix itself after nearly collapsing the economy. Rubenstein, co-founder of the Washington, D.C-based private equity firm Carlyle Group, says he was disappointed, saddened and embarrassed by the partial government shutdown and near-breach of the nation's borrowing limit. Rubenstein may not be a household name, but in the world of philanthropy and finance, he is a celebrity. Rubenstein, 64, and two partners co-founded Carlyle in 1987 with $5 million in capital. After starting off investing primarily in the defense industry, Carlyle quickly expanded. The firm has gone on to invest in companies like Dunkin' Donuts, Nielsen, and Hertz. The bread and butter business for private equity is the leveraged buyout, where a firm uses debt to buy a company in hopes of turning it around for a profit. Private equity has expanded into other products, however, including ones aimed at average investors. Carlyle is now the second-largest private equity firm after Texas-based TPG. Rubenstein is worth roughly $2.6 billion, the 206th richest person in the U.S., according to Forbes magazine. Like Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, Rubenstein has pledged to give away the bulk of his fortune. He gave $7.5 million to help repair the Washington Monument. The panda enclosure at Washington's National Zoo is named after Rubenstein. He's made numerous other donations to the arts and humanities throughout the country as well. Rubenstein sat down with The Associated Press recently to discuss the government shutdown and his outlook for the economy. Rubenstein also spoke about a future in which private equity, an investment traditionally reserved for pension funds or rich families, will be accessible to all. The interview is edited for length and clarity: Q: What is your outlook for the economy? A: The U.S. economy is not in a recession, technically, but maybe this period should be called a recession in the future. The economy is struggling to come back and it's growing at a slower pace than we would like. The recession reduced a lot of people's willingness to invest, to buy homes, to build homes, a whole variety of things. We've accumulated so much debt on our government's balance sheet that it's slowing the growth of the economy. We have growing economic inequality. It's getting much worse as a result of the recession and we have to do something about that. We have a dysfunctional government that's unable to give direction to business people and workers on where the country is going. You add all those factors up; it does make people a little bit nervous spending money, borrowing money, taking some risk. We are slowly fixing those problems. However, it's going to be a slow recovery and I don't think we will see 4 percent growth any time soon. Q: What was your reaction to the 16-day government shutdown and the near breach of the nation's debt ceiling? A: I am relieved that the shutdown and debt ceiling crisis are behind us. Hopefully something like this will not occur again. But I am disappointed, saddened and embarrassed for our country that our democracy did not work as the founding fathers had hoped. Q: What should Congress tackle first ó now that the debt ceiling and shutdown is resolved? A: They should try to reassure the country ó and the world ó that the last few weeks were an aberration and not likely to be repeated early next year. Once that re-assurance occurs, focus on how to spur economic growth ó while reducing economic disparity ó (which) would be a great plus for everyone. Q: What is the state of the private equity industry? A: Deal volume is less than half of what it was in 2007 and fundraising is now 46 percent of what it was. One bright spot is that distributions (to investors) have just about fully returned to their pre-recession peak. As a result, the private equity firms have also re-tooled themselves. There is much more hands-on work with the companies than there ever was before, and far less financial engineering. A number of the firms have gone public as well. While they're not household names, they are now publicly traded and operate in a different model than they ever did before. You also see much more emphasis on investing outside the U.S. Q: If private equity is about turning around companies, why have you focused on the emerging markets rather than the U.S., particularly with what companies went through in the recession? A: The first rule of investing is to diversify. In the U.S. and developed markets, you have aging populations, large government debt, large government entitlement programs and very slow growth. Compare that to emerging markets where you have modest debt levels, much younger populations, larger GDP growth and fewer government entitlement programs. If you're going to participate in the global marketplace, you should invest in these markets. Take China. China is the second-largest economy in the world and we still call it an "emerging market." To me, anyone who wants to have a diversified investment program should invest outside of the U.S. and take advantage of those factors. Q: Your industry has been expanding into other products aimed at a broader array of investors. Do you see a time when the average American will have a segment of their retirement invested in private equity, just like they do with bonds or stocks? A: Anybody who has an investment portfolio should include the usual assets like fixed income and stocks but also should include alternatives. For individuals, alternative investments should be 5 percent to 15 percent, which would include private equity, buyouts, growth capital, and real estate. We think investors would be interested in our brand name, our quality of investing. In the long run, it would strengthen our company as well to have that type of diversification Copyright (2013) Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Flickr/ricinThe stock market closed at a fresh all-time high today. And some investors are understandably nervous about what's next. For the most part, the experts aren't recommending dumping stocks. However, at least four of Wall Street's top strategists have reduced their bullish positions to something much more neutral. "U.S. equities have gained 25% year to date and the S&amp;P 500 is above 1750, which is the outer end of the range we estimated at the start of the year," said Nuveen Asset Management's Bob Doll. "We believe the risk-reward tradeoff has become more neutral."  "Our view is S&amp;P 500 trades at fair value and the forward path of the index will follow the trajectory of profit growth," said Goldman Sachs' David Kostin in a new note to clients. BlackRock's Russ Koesterich shares Kostin's view. "U.S. stocks are now trading at roughly 2.5x book value, a 15% increase from the end of 2012," said Koesterich last week. "In other words, the majority of this year's gains have come through higher multiples, not a boom in corporate earnings. And while U.S. stocks still look reasonable compared to history, they are looking fully valued relative to an environment of 2% growth. This does not mean the market is due for a correction, but simply that going forward, gains need to be more driven by earnings growth; otherwise, U.S. stocks will start to climb into overvalued territory." Morgan Stanley's Adam Parker has definitely been one of the more cautious strategists on Wall Street.† But in recent months he's been increasingly bullish because of how he interprets the complicated calculus of the markets. From his note to clients today: The confusion for investors may be that even though the current corporate conditions seem mediocre, if tapering isn't an issue until 2014, it gives investors a green light between now and year-end to take risk. That's why we have remained bullish through the last three months and why we remain constructive today: mediocre base case below the consensus expectations + low probability of bear case = market rally? The takeaway from Parker's statement is that he's "constructive," which is one of the more lukewarm endorsements for stocks without explicitly expressing bullishness. "Our investment advice has been to keep the portfolio beta near 1.0x," said Parker. In other words, don't get too fancy with you equity investments ó your best bet is to just stick with the S&amp;P 500. "Neutral," "fair value," "fully valued," and "constructive" are definitely not as exciting as "buy," "overweight," "attractive," and "undervalued."

The Popular Risk Parity Asset Allocation Strategy Can Help Us Avoid Perfect Storms (The Wall Street Journal) Many advisors have been in favor of using risk parity as an allocation strategy, but others have pointed out some fundamental flaws. Risk parity refers to allocating in a a way that puts an equal distribution of risk among the "forces" that drive various asset classes in a portfolio. In a new WSJ column, Kevin Kneafse senior advisor to Schroders Multi Asset Investment and Portfolio Solutions, writes that despite some criticism it has received, risk parity does offer value. "Risk parity is good at harnessing the power of diversification, but diversification is blind to what you pay to gain balanced exposure," Kneafsey writes. A traditional portfolio of 60% stock and 40% bonds has risk "highly concentrated in one return driver: economic growth." And it's exposure to this sort of risk that has given us perfect storms. "If your income is a function of the economy's strength and the assets in your portfolio are concentrated in equities, when economic growth slows, you're going to get hit on both fronts. ÖThat's what we think we can avoid by using a risk parity approach. It allows us to begin by mitigating risk before we bring the additional information we have as advisers--asset valuation, managing market extremes--to bear on the portfolio." Why Investors Are Loving European Stocks (Investment News)  European stocks have become the new hot investment. Chris Alderson, president of T. Rowe Price International told Investment News that the interest in European stocks is being driven by the improvement in European economies. "The tail risk is off the table. Maybe most importantly, they're a lot cheaper than stocks here in the U.S.," he said.† He also pointed out the areas of the eurozone in which he sees the most opportunities. "We've recently moved our focus from luxury exporters, such as Gucci (GUCG) and Ferrari (FERI), to more domestic stocks in Spain and Italy. We've seen significant improvement in those economies. International small-caps could pick up, too. They haven't had anywhere near the rally small-caps have had in the States." 5 Ways Your Brain Tricks You Into Making Horrible Investment Decisions (Value Stock Guide) When it comes to investing, your brain is often your worst enemy. Valuestock highlights five common ways the brain tricks people into making bad investment decisions.† 1. Herd behavior in which investors do what everyone else is doing. This "forces investors to miss out on the bottom floor of booming markets," and prevents them from "getting out before the market hits the top" or when they sense danger. 2. The brain confuses cheap and good value. 3. You throw good money after bad because of the time and money already invested in it. 4. You practice loss aversion which in turn leads to bad choices. 5. Your brain tricks you into thinking the "future is more unpredictable than it really is." Six Things Advisors Can Do To Become Better Leaders (Advisor Perspectives) The financial industry needs to work on its communication and people skills, according to practice management consultant, Beverly Flaxington. In a new Advisor Perspectives column, she highlights six simple things that can help improve communication and make advisors better leaders.† 1. "Learn how to present with confidence." 2. "Remember that they can work elsewhere." 3. "You can never communicate enough." 4. "Learn what the people below you do every day." 5. "Let them bring forth both problems and solutions." 6. "Recognize that itís not all about the money ñ or assets." Chase Wealth Management Gets New CEO (Marketwatch)  JP Morgan has named Michael Boardman the CEO of Chase Wealth Management.

A deal was†announced†in April 2010, after 18 months of begging. BYD would set up its North American headquarters in Los Angeles. It would build a manufacturing plant for solar panels, electric batteries, and electric cars nearby. It would employ 150 people in the first year and could hire up to 2,000 more people in the following years. It would spend $100 million on construction and create 1,600 construction jobs. And taxpayers would cough up massive subsidies. ìWith all that Los Angeles was offering, it was hard to refuse coming here,î BYD Chairman and billionaire founder Wang Chuan-fu gloated at the press conference. Schwarzenegger hyped Californiaís ìmarket-friendly energy and environmental policiesî and smiled victoriously. ìThis is just the start,î added L.A. Mayor Antonio R. Villaraigosa. ìBYD will be creating the high-paying green-collar jobs that we want....î Today, BYDís headquarters is in a refurbished building in downtown L.A. The manufacturing site in Lancaster, a suburb of L.A., is an RV plant that had been closed. Nothing was built. ìThe plant is still mostly vacant save for a small number of local workers,î reported the†New York Times. And ìthree engineers from China were working to install factory equipment.î In total, fewer than 40 people are working for BYD in California ñ and even fewer Americans. What†has†come to California are BYDís Chinese workers, and they got paid $1.50 per hour, plus a $50/day allowance. ìYou cannot pay people in Chinese dollars with Chinese standards while they are doing work in America,î state labor commissioner Julie Su told the†Times. ìIf this is the tip of the iceberg, you could see this ruining all kinds of industries.î After an investigation, BYD was fined $99,245 for, among other things, minimum wage violations and failure to provide workersí comp insurance. ìWorkers in this kind of underground economy may not know what their rights are,î Su pointed out. ìIt doesnít matter where a company is based, if an employee is working here, the company has to abide by California law when theyíre doing work in California. In no scenario is it permissible to cycle people through to get around our stateís laws.î But BYDís Chinese execs didnít seem to think so. They said theyíd appeal the citation, as the†Times†put it, ìarguing that Chinese workers here on legal work visas are not subject to state labor laws, including the minimum wage.î BYD has signed contracts this year to†supply 35 K9 battery-powered electric buses†to Long Beach and Los Angeles. $40 million are at stake. BYD is also testing a bus in Manhattan. Currently, it builds these buses in China. But the contracts stipulate that the buses meet ìBuy Americaî procurement guidelines: final assembly must be in the US, and US content,at least on paper, must be 60% of the cost of the bus. † At the end of April, BYD announced with fanfare that it would build the buses and the iron-phosphate batteries that power them in Lancaster, starting May 1. It might employ a few dozen people. ìWe are starting small,î said Stella Li, BYD senior vice president. The†Wall Street Journal†noted at the time: ìBut the benefits of BYDís move will be immediate, allowing it to sell its buses to local transit companies at a huge discount ñ with the federal government picking up the rest of the tab.î Taxpayers are digging deep into their pockets to support the arrangement: Federal grants for zero-emission buses and other Federal and California subsidies cover up to 80% of the cost of the buses. BYD spokesman Michael Austin admitted that subsidies were ìone of the main motivationsî behind the deal. Itís not like there isnít already an American company eager to sell electric buses: South Carolina-based†Proterra, which has buses operating in a number of American cities, wanted to bid on the deal but didnít get very far. BYD already has a stellar record. In order to finagle the Long Beach deal, BYD had claimed that it ìhad already deployed several buses within the US ñ particularly to Apple in Cupertino and Hertz in Los Angeles,î the†Long Beach Post†reported in March. However, the paper checked with ìseveral Apple and Hertz executivesî and found that ìthe claims BYD presented to Long Beach Transit are false.î BYD also†appears to have fabricated claims†of units in service in Milan and Holland. And there are performance shortcomings. A Chinese-made BYD bus did a trial run for Hertz in L.A. last December. ìThe companyís state-of-the-art electric buses provide a range of over 155 miles on a single charge, BYD claimed on its†website. Thatís important because recharging the thing takes three to four hours. However, the results of the Hertz trial that theLong Beach Post†obtained showed that the bus actually had a range of only 123 miles, without using heating or air conditioning. ìOn a hot day with a full passenger load, the bus performance would actually result in about a 65 mile range.î†Less than half†the claimed range! The bus is also way overweight due to the massive battery ñ so overweight that it would take a toll on streets and raise maintenance costs, according Long Beachís Chief Traffic Engineer, David Roseman ñ a problem that had been known since†before†the contract was signed, but Long Beach Transit officials had swept it under the rug. Then there was the debacle of testing the bus for efficiency and structural soundness at the federal†Altoona Bus Research and Testing Center†in Pennsylvania. With no American-made bus available, BYD had a Chinese-made bus tested there. By July 12, after six of the 17 tests, and after about 2,600 miles, visible cracks appeared above the rear door. BYD yanked the bus out of the testing program and†claimed†that the problem was due to crummy welding, rather than a design flaw. Now somewhat leery, Long Beach Transit decided to have an American-made bus, when available, tested at Altoona before completing the purchase of its ten buses. This pushed the completion date ñ originally January 2014 ñ to January 2015. When Long Beach Transit inspectors headed to China to inspect the buses, they ìdiscovered ëunacceptableí issues with the bus frames, including ëimproper bracket installationí on the bus sidewalls and roof assemblies and inconsistencies with steel subassemblies on the chassis, according to a staff report,î the†Long Beach Post†reported on October 8. The company promised that it would put 20 engineers to work to figure out what to do about the flawed frame before the first bus for Long Beach Transit would be built. Turns out, that wasnít true either, as the paper found out: ìA staff report indicates that the frame for LBTís pilot bus has already been built and inspected.î BYD stands for ìBuild Your Dream.î And maybe thatís what theyíre trying to do in China. But here theyíre building a nightmare, lushly funded by hapless American taxpayers ñ and they paid Chinese workers in California $1.50 per hour to do it. Next time Gov. Brown and et al. go on begging missions to China, they need to keep that in mind. Consumer spending hasnít exactly been hot. With one big exception: auto sales. At 20% of total retail sales, theyíve been phenomenal and propped up overall retail sales. But in September, there was a downdraft. The calendar got blamed. And in October, there was the government shutdown and debt-ceiling debacle. And now all bets are off.

REUTERS/Toby MelvilleThe sports-betting affiliate of Cantor Fitzgerald is under investigation for money laundering, sources tell the Wall Street Journal's Alexandra Berzon and Michael Rothfeld. While Michael Colbert, the former chief bookmaker of Cantor Gaming, pleaded guilty in August to fraud conspiracy, the Journal reports that a federal investigation is looking further up the chain at whether Colbert's boss had a role in accepting illegal sports bets. From the report: Investigators at multiple government agencies are also examining whether Cantor Gaming personnel allowed the laundering of millions of dollars of illegal gambling money flowing through its accounts, people familiar with the probes said. They described investigators as focused in part on whether Cantor accepted deposits it shouldn't have and failed to report suspicious transactions to the government. A spokesman for parent Cantor Fitzgerald said that "the company knows of no wrongdoing other than by Mr. Colbert." Nevertheless, about a half dozen agencies ó like the Treasury Departments Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and the IRS ó are reportedly probing the company, the Journal reports.

ReutersThinking of switching banks? You're not alone. According to a J.D. Power and Associates survey released in February this year, 9.6 percent of customers had switched banks during the past 12 months. That figure is on the rise, up from 8.7 percent in 2011 and 7.7 percent in 2010, according to the survey. And while reasons for switching banks vary, experts warn that certain indicators mean you should leave your current bank, and do so quickly. To keep your money safe and satisfaction high, here are five signs it may be time to store your cash in a different bank. To see how your bank is holding up financially, routinely check the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.'s website, says Jim Angleton, president and CEO of AEGIS FinServ Corp., a firm that provides debt resolution and other financial services. There you can see if your bank is maintaining its FDIC insurance. This insurance covers all deposit accounts, including checking and savings accounts, money market deposit accounts, and certificates of deposit. The standard insurance amount is $250,000 per depositor per insured bank. That means if you have $250,000 or less stored at your bank and the bank fails, you'll still receive your cash. On the other hand, if your bank is not maintaining its FDIC insurance, consider it a red flag. If the bank goes under, none of your deposits will be insured. Currently, larger banks are making a push to increase fee revenue to offset the loss of credit card fees associated with regulatory changes, says Randy Jarvis, president of Union National Bank in Sparta, Wis. This means you might see new charges popping up, such as maintenance fees on debit cards and checking accounts, ATM fees, online banking fees and transaction fees. While banks vary, you might find that a local institution has lower costs, Jarvis says. "Most community banks are more hesitant to introduce such fees, and have typically had lower fees even before the regulatory changes," he says. Maybe at one time, your bank fit your lifestyle perfectly, yet shifts in your job responsibilities, working hours and even your marital status can lead to a less-than-ideal arrangement. Say you belong to a local credit union, but now you travel frequently for work. You may need a bank with a national presence that has branches in the cities you visit most often, says Michael Hermens, president of Finance Forward LLC, a financial advisory firm in Dallas. The same holds true for bank hours. If you regularly leave the office at 6:30 p.m. and want to swing past the bank on your way home, you might need a place with extended hours. For newlyweds with accounts set up at different banks, it may be time to compare the two options. Sort through the costs of each, such as what you'll pay for checks, wire transfers, overdraft protection charges and account maintenance. If the costs at one or both banks seem too high, take it as a warning sign. "If you have to change your habits or your lifestyle to cut down on banking costs, it's time to look for another bank," Hermens says. Do you find that every time you walk into your current bank, you get greeted (or ignored) by a stressed-out staff? Are you asked to repeat your account number three times in a 10-minute span? Do your questions on banking remain unanswered? "A banking relationship is much like any other relationship. If you are unhappy with the way you are being treated, you can do something about it," says John Rosenfeld, executive vice president of retail deposit products at TD Bank with co-headquarters in Portland, Maine, and Cherry Hill, N.J. To find a bank that meets your expectations, look for one that offers customer service beyond a teller, Rosenfeld says. Check for institutions that have a 24/7 help line and customer service phone numbers that lead to real representatives as opposed to an automated voice message. Also look for online tools, such as a live chat with a customer representative. Some banks are available to customers via Twitter. If your banking institution is low on technology-based offerings, you may be better off money-wise looking for a place with a wider array of online and mobile banking options. "Having real-time account information at your fingertips can help you make better financial decisions," Rosenfeld says. You'll be able to access account information such as your current balance, any pending transactions and banking history with online tools. Some banks let you set up an alert to notify you when your balance has reached a certain amount or when a new online statement is available. You also may be able to pay bills online, order new checks, transfer funds between accounts and access deposit accounts.
BEA, SG Cross Asset Research Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale economists Aneta Markowska and Brian Jones are slashing the bank's forecasts for Q3 and Q4 2013 U.S. GDP growth, citing the effects of the government shutdown that spanned the first two weeks of October. In a note to clients, Markowska and Jones write: Hitting a reset button on our economic forecasts Data available to date suggests that the economy clocked in a 2.3% annualized growth rate in¬†Q3, i.e. marginally lower than our published forecast of 3%. The chart below shows a breakdown of contributions to growth by sector. While nearly every sector of the economy has shown some deceleration vs. Q2, consumer demand is the major reason for our revision, with real consumption now assumed to have grown at just 1.5% (tomorrow‚Äôs retail sales will be the¬†next key data input into this estimate). We are also revising down our Q4 forecast from 3.6% to 3.0% to account for the effects of the government shutdown and for the slightly weaker momentum coming out of Q3. We remain fundamentally bullish on the US growth. Since the start of the year, we have been calling for an inflection point around mid-year as the last of the headwinds began to dissipate. While the government shutdown has prolonged the period of fiscal uncertainty, the reality remains that new austerity ‚Äì above and beyond what was legislated at the start of this year ‚Äì is quite unlikely. Policy uncertainty is also on a downtrend, notwithstanding recent spike. And, housing should continue to be supported by declining real mortgage rates. Earlier this month, Bank of America became the first major bank to slash its U.S. GDP growth forecasts for Q3, Q4, and even Q1 2014, citing the effects of the government shutdown and the debt ceiling debate that gripped markets over the first half of October. In a note to clients, BAML economist Ethan Harris wrote: As we have noted before, the shutdown has made the economic and Fed outlook much more uncertain. Prior to the shutdown, the economy seemed to be still stuck at 2% growth, but with hope of stronger growth ahead. The shutdown caused both an austerity shock ‚Äî cuts in government spending ‚Äî and an uncertainty shock. The shutdown has hurt sentiment a lot, pushing many survey measures lower. Looking ahead, the issue now is does sentiment quickly go back to pre-crisis levels or does it linger lower? The latter is likely if people worry about a sequence of shutdowns. Hence we need to wait for post-crisis survey data to get a clear sense of the lasting damage. Given release lags, it will take even longer to judge the impact on hard data. The results of the first post-shutdown surveys were not pleasant. Markit's flash U.S. manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index survey¬†revealed the first monthly contraction in manufacturing output¬†in October since September 2009. The University of Michigan's consumer confidence survey¬†revealed a sharp drop in sentiment¬†over the course of October. Though Wall Street largely expects the U.S. economy to finally accelerate in 2014, a new "shadow consensus" of slow growth and continued monetary easing is beginning to emerge.
Revenue, EPS, and iPhone sales are ahead of expectations. iPad sales were a little worse than expected, but not too bad.¬† The stock initially tanked after the numbers were out thanks to weaker than expected margin guidance.

REUTERS/Jim YoungParticipants take part in an attempt to set a new Guinness World Record for the largest pillow fight, in Chicago, October 27, 2013. The stock market sits near all-time highs. First, the scoreboard: And now the top stories:
Associated PressPARIS (Reuters) - Francois Hollande has become the most unpopular French president on record, an opinion poll showed on Monday, with the Socialist leader hit by anger over tax hikes, unemployment and rows over the government's immigration policy. Hollande's popularity has sunk to 26 percent of those surveyed, the first time the BVA poll has seen a French president's approval ratings fall below 30 percent. Hollande's approval rating had started sinking quite soon after he was elected in May 2012 but this survey shows his popularity lower than that of any other president at any time in their term in the 32 years the BVA survey has been carried out. This underlines the task facing Hollande and his government in reviving their popularity at a time when record high jobless numbers and wrangling over tax levels have clouded efforts to revitalize a sluggish economy. The poll shows a near-unanimous unpopularity among right-wing voters: 97 percent have a bad opinion of Hollande, a level never reached by any president among supporters of other parties, even former conservative president¬†Nicolas Sarkozy, although he deeply antagonized many left-wing voters. While Hollande is dragging his¬†Socialist party's approval ratings down, the far-right¬†National Front¬†keeps progressing, with the two parties now with the same approval ratings. Some 84 percent of those surveyed on October 24-25 believed government policy was not efficient and 74 percent said it was not fair. Hollande has seen his popularity sink further after he was widely criticized for offering to allow a deported immigrant teenager to return to¬†France¬†but without her family. In a Harris Interactive poll on Thursday, four fifths of French voters said they believed Hollande would not win the next presidential election in 2017. The outgoing president traditionally represents his party in the next election and in past decades most, with the exception of Sarkozy, won a second mandate.

Puerto Ricans are enduring another round of austerity cuts as it works to close an $820 million deficit and satisfy bondholders who own $70 billion-worth of Puerto Rican debt. Now, there's been a rash of break-ins because the island's school system cannot afford nighttime guards, according to the island's El Nuevo Dia newspaper. On Friday, a middle school reported $30,000 worth of electrical equipment had been lifted.† And earlier this month, two computers were stolen from an elementary school. Two men were also arrested for having stolen $20,000 worth of supplies in August. One legislator has introduced a bill that would up the penalty for stealing from the state school system. "Given the relative lack of funds that we're experiencing, we must safeguard property and guarantee that the education of our students won't be affected," El Nuevo Dia quoted†Rafael ìTatitoî Hern·ndez†as saying. "Stealing from children must be met with the full weight of the law, which is we are submitting this bill. We cannot be soft when it comes to stealing from schools." † Last week, S&amp;P confirmed its outlook for the rating for the island's as BBB- with a negative outlook.
REUTERS/Brendan McDermidCalifornia-based multi-level nutritional†products seller†Herbalifeóthe company at the center of an epic clash of billionaire hedge fund titansó is scheduled to report third quarter earnings results today.† On average, analysts expect Herbalife to report adjusted earnings per share of $1.14, up 9.8% year-over-year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales are expected to come in at $1.197 billion, up 17.7% year-over-year. Net income adjusted is expected to come in at $122.333 million, up 3.9% year-over-year, Bloomberg data shows. † Herbalife, which sells products such as weight loss shakes and supplements, has been caught in the middle of a hedge fund war.† Late last year, hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, who runs Pershing Square Capital, publicly declared that he was shorting†20 million shares, or $1†billion, worth of Herbalife stock with a price target of $0. Ackman believes the company is a "pyramid scheme" that targets lower income†people, especially from the Hispanic population. †He thinks the Federal Trade Commission will be†persuaded to investigate and shut the company down. A bunch of other hedge fund managers have disagreed with Ackman. †A few of them even snapped up long positions after he gave his 342-slide†presentation.†The most notable is Carl Icahn, Ackman's long time rival. Icahn is the largest shareholder in Herbalife with more than 16.9 million shares, or a 16.46% stake.†He has said that he believes Ackman†will be the victim of the†"mother of all short squeezes." Icahn told Fox Business Network today that he thinks Herbalife will continue to grow. He also said he doesn't think the company hurts anyone.† Daniel Loeb of Third Point had a sizeable stake in the company earlier this year. †He exited that position for a nice profit. George Soros' family office hedge fund owns more than 5 million shares of Herbalife. Ackman complained to the SEC that Soros' fund†securities laws when that Herbalife stake was revealed. †Days later, it was reported that Soros redeemed all his money from Ackman's Pershing Square.† So far, Ackman's short has been disastrous for him. Since December 2012, shares of surged more than 56%. † What's more is Ackman had to reposition his short at the beginning of this month in an effort to reduce risk.†Pershing Square swapped more than 40%†of its equity short position in Herbalife for put options. Still, Ackman remains confident in his "pyramid scheme" belief, according to the fund's investor letter from earlier this month.†
In my view, this kind of parabolic-looking jump has developed out of quite a silly situation, and one I think is a good exhibit of just how irrational and weird markets can sometimes be. London real estate prices have been rising strongly for a long while, and a large quantity ó†over half for houses above £1 million†ó of the demand for London real estate is coming from overseas buyers. It is comprehensible that London is a desirable place to live, and that demand for housing in London might be higher than elsewhere in the UK. It is a diverse and rich place culturally and socially, boasting a huge variety of shopping, parks, art galleries, creative communities, restaurants, monuments and landmarks, theatres and venues, financial service providers, lawyers, think tanks, technology startups, universities, scientific institutions, sports clubs and infrastructure.†Britainís legal framework†and itsstraightforward tax structure for wealthy foreign residents†has proven highly attractive to the global super rich. With London real estate proving perennially popular, and with the global low-interest rate environment that has made borrowing for speculation cheap and easy, it is highly unsurprising that prices and rents have pushed upward and upward as the global super rich ó alongside pension funds and hedge funds ó sitting on large piles of cash have sought to achieve higher yields than cash or bonds by speculating in real estate. In some senses, London real estate (and real estate in other globally-desirable cities) has become†a new reserve currency. And while this has occurred, price rises have proven increasingly cyclical as both London residents and speculators have sought to buy. The higher prices go, the more London residents become desperate to get their feet on the property ladder in fear they wonít ever be able to do so, and the more speculators are drawn in, seeing London real estate as an asset that just keeps going up and up. Yet the bigger the bubble, the bigger the bust. And I think what we are seeing in London is a large psychological bubble, a mass delusion built on other delusions. Chief among these delusions is that real estate should be seen as a productive investment,†as an implicit pension fund, or as a guaranteed source of real yield.† While investors can look at real estate however they like, there is no getting away from the fact that†real estate is a deteriorating asset. Sitting on a deteriorating asset and hoping for a real price gain ó or even to preserve your purchasing power ó is a speculation, not a productive investment. For commercial enterprises buying as a premises for business, or for residents buying as a place to live this is not in itself problematic. But as an investment this can be hugely problematic. It is just gambling on a deteriorating asset under the guise of buying a ìsafeî asset. Of course, in the UK where housing has been treated by many successive governments as an investment, and as a haven for savings and pensions, real estate owners have done particularly well. Governments have been willing to prop up the market with liquidity via schemes like†Help To Buy†and via restrictive planning laws to rig the market to restrict supply. This may make investors feel particularly secure, but governments can be forced ó not least by demographics ó to swing in another direction. An important side-effect of continually rising prices and a restricted supply of housing is that†many people will not be able to afford to buy a home.†With the house prices-to-wages ratio sitting far above the long-term average, the next UK government will come under severe pressure within the next few years to allow ó and probably subsidise ó much more housebuilding to bring down housing costs for the population. The past-trend of government-protected gains may have inspired a false sense of security in investors. But such a reversal of policy would not in itself crash the London real estate market. After all, London is a unique place in Britain, and the majority of the new housebuilding may take place away from London. More likely, the bubble will simply collapse under the weight of its own growth. Sooner or later, even with liquidity cheap and plentiful, the number of speculators seeking to cash out will exceed the number of speculators seeking to cash in, and confidence will dip. Sometimes, this simply equates to a small correction in the context of a large upward trend, but sometimes ó especially when it can be negatively rationalised ó it manifests in to a deeper malaise. When this occurs, one probable rationalisation is as follows. †Domestically, many of the relatively low-income artists, designers, technologists, musicians, students, artisans, academics, service workers and professionals (etc) who make London London are priced out, then they will go and contribute to communities elsewhere where rents and housing costs are lower ó Birmingham, Manchester, Glasgow, Paris, Berlin, out into the sprawl of the home counties, and deeper into the English countryside, to places where a four bedroom house costs the same as a studio apartment in central London. Where once this would have been culturally, professionally and socially prohibitive, fast, ubiquitous internet allows for people to live a culturally and socially connected life without necessarily living in a big city like London. Internationally, other cheaper cities and jurisdictions will simply catch up with London in terms of amenities and desirability to the global super class. Competition for global capital †is huge, and while London as an Old World metropolis has done well since 2008, it may suffer in the wake of renewed competition from newer, cheaper, faster-growing Eastern metropolises. When the bubble begins to burst ó something that I think could occur endogenously within the next five years, especially if the fast increases continue ó speculators, and especially speculators who are heavily leveraged may face severe problems, resulting in a worsened liquidation and contraction, and possibly threatening the liquidity of heavily-invested lenders. As many people at the table are sitting on big gains, they may prove desperate to cash out.† Just as many presently feel pressured to get in to avoid being priced out of London forever, a downward turn could be severely worsened as many who are heavily invested in the bubble and scared of losing gains on which they hoped to fund retirements (etc) feel pressured to get out. Such an accelerated liquidation could easily lead to another recession. While I doubt that London prices will fall below the UK average, prices may see a very sharp correction. The psychological bubble is composed of multiple fallacies ó that housing is a safe place to put savings and not a speculation,†that†deteriorating†real estate should yield higher returns than productive business investments, that the UK government will continue to protect real estate speculators, that large flows of capital from overseas speculators will continue into London. A bursting of any of these fallacies could begin to bring the whole thing into question, even in the context of continued provision of liquidity from the Bank of England.
Skybridge Capital's Anthony "Mooch" Scaramucci went on an epic rant this afternoon on CNBC's "Fast Money" after the news broke that SAC Capital and U.S. prosecutors could reach a settlement deal in the coming days.¬† Scaramucci has been a vocal supporter of embattled billionaire hedge fund manager Steve Cohen. Cohen's Stamford, Connecticut-based SAC Capital has been criminally charged for insider trading. ¬†SAC was¬†charged with four counts of securities fraud and one count of wire fraud. SAC could face a possible fine north of $1 billion and have to admit guilt.¬† Anchor Scott Wapner asked Scaramucci, who runs a fund of funds, about the possibility of Cohen not being able to manage money and the impact on his business. ¬† He didn't really answer the question, though.¬† "I think it's sad for the people who have their money managed by Steve. He's had a great performance this year. You guys know how I feel about him personally. I hope that this is the cycle of the witch hunting ending for the Department of Justice and the SEC."¬† Wapner replied, "I understand...Guilty plea changes things a little bit doesn't it? "Scott, when they paint you into the corner and they have unlimited resources OK. And you're trying to get on with your life. It's sort of one of the only things you can do on the Venn Diagram. ¬†The Department of Justice and the SEC are gone crazy in these matters. OK look at JPMorgan. Not just SAC/Cohen. They're after everybody. I think it's unfair. I'm one of the few people who's bold enough to speak out about it."¬† It didn't end there, though. ¬†A few minutes later Scaramucci took over the conversation again. ¬† "They've got to scapegoat a few people, OK. And what they hope ot do is they hold those people up as an example to scare the rest of the people. And Marc Cuban, in Marc Cuban's case, they had to drop the case."¬† Then, as the music was coming on for the commercial break, Wapner stopped it so Scaramucci could make his point. ¬† Scaramucci kept on comparing the SAC Capital case to Salem witch hunts. He believes the SEC is just upset because they messed up the Bernie Madoff ponzi scheme case.¬† "OK. Look, they're upset. I know you guys didn't get the Madoff thing right. You went in there and investigated him several times and blew it. So now you're on a witch hunt for everybody. Why don't we just stop it at this point."¬† Kate Kelly jumped in and pointed out that a recent survey of hedge fund professionals showed that people had witnessed bad or illegal behavior in their workplace.¬† Scaramucci dismissed that.¬† "Like any profession, doctors, etc., there are bad actors everywhere but what we do in the media is we focus on two or three things and make it look like the whole industry is tainted when we really know that's not the case. Moreover, when someone is answering a survey like that, I think they have an inclination to create fires. So that's my opinion and I'm going to hold to it," he said.¬† He also went on to point out that the hedge fund industry is also for blue collar workers.¬† "There's two-and-a-half trillion dollars in the hedge fund industry for a reason. People have done an amazing job in the hedge fund industry for clients and let me give a news flash for the SEC‚ÄîMany blue collar workers are inside hedge funds, including SkyBridge, where we do a phenomenal job taking care of them, guiding them toward actuary numbers for their retirement."¬† "Now I hope the witch hunt is over. You're probably going to get the guy to plead guilty on something. You had ten years to try to find something to plead him personally guilty and you couldn't find it. He's stuck in the corner now and he's going to have to please guilty for his corporation and I hope it's over with."¬† We could only find part of Scaramucci's "Fast Money" appearance online. It also comes with a disclaimer about how his opinions are not those of CNBC or NBCUniversal.¬† Check it out:¬† 
Apple will report earnings on Monday afternoon when the market closes. We‚Äôll have the numbers as soon as they hit, so make sure you tune in for the results¬†and analysis of Apple‚Äôs performance. This is going to be the most interesting Apple‚Äôs earnings call of the year. As far as we can tell, Apple has announced all its major products for the year, so now it‚Äôs time for management to provide clues about how those products are performing. (Maybe it‚Äôs not done for the year, and has another product planned. If so, we expect to hear a clue about that.) The product line ‚Äî iPhone 5S, iPhone 5C, iPad Air, and iPad Mini ‚Äî was largely known in advance/expected by analysts. What they don‚Äôt know is how those products are performing. And, if Apple is struggling to make those products.¬† We want to hear Apple management talk about the iPhone 5C. The 5C was expected to be a ‚Äúcheap‚Äù phone. It is not. Compared to other mid-level phones, it‚Äôs expensive. As a result, sales are reportedly weak, and Apple is said to be cutting orders. Apple will probably not have much direct to say on the 5C, but we‚Äôre looking forward to hearing why it was priced the way it was, as well as what kind of consumer reaction Apple is seeing. The iPhone 5S is still in short supply, so we want to hear when Apple will get that fixed. As for the iPad business, it contracted in the June quarter. Will that happen again? If it does, what does this mean for the iPad business overall? Can it be the mega-product that complements the iPhone? Or is it going to be a smaller than expected piece of the business? We‚Äôre also curious to see what Apple has to say about the iPad Mini with Retina display. Apple made the unusual decision to announce it without a release date. This suggests it‚Äôs struggling to make the new iPad Mini. We‚Äôre looking for information on the Retina supply for the holiday season. Other random stuff: We‚Äôd love for an analyst to ask Tim Cook for his thoughts on Samsung‚Äôs Galaxy Gear smart watch, which was a critical flop. Apple is reportedly exploring the space, and perhaps Cook would tip his hand a little bit. We‚Äôd like any clues or hints on future products. Is the iWatch coming next year? What about an Apple television? This is a really exciting earnings report with more questions to be answered than usual. You‚Äôre not going to want to miss it. Here are the big numbers people are expecting. Revenue and EPS are via Yahoo Finance, and product lines are from buy-side analysts, via Gene Munster of Piper Jaffray:

On Friday, the big automakers will report their October sales stats. Analysts believe sales accelerated to an annualized pace of 15.4 million units, up from 15.3 million units in September. "[I]ndustry surveys indicate that increased consumer caution during the government shutdown led to weak sales results in the first half of the month," said Morgan Stanley's Ted Wieseman. "Retail demand appears to have improved significantly after the shutdown ended, and fleet sales picked up, but with the weak start only a modest rebound in sales for the month as a whole is expected." In the near-term, bullish forces remain in place for the auto industry. "One factor supporting further gains for the automotive sector is the age of the US Auto Fleet, which R.L. Polk puts at 11.4 years in 2013," noted Oppenheimer's John Stoltzfus in a note to clients this week. "Although quality improvements are likely allowing people to drive their vehicles longer, we think many have held off replacing their vehicles due to concerns about the economy. "As employment and economic security increase in coming months, we believe we could see a sharp rise in auto sales as drivers trade in for new vehicles." Oppenheimer

A Tesla Model S caught fire after crashing through a concrete wall and into a tree in Mexico last week. According to Mexican paper Progreso Hoy, the driver was speeding. He was not seriously injured, and has asked for expedited delivery of his next Model S, according to a Tesla spokesperson. Earlier this month, a Model S in Washington State caught fire after it hit a large metal object in the street. In a blog post, CEO Elon Musk noted that was the first time a Tesla caught fire on a public road, and that the flames never entered the passenger compartment. Progreso Hoy posted this video of the aftermath of the Mexico crash, which shows the car on fire, and an explosion at the 0:15 mark:  ¬†Here's the full statement from Tesla: "We were able to contact the driver quickly and are pleased that he is safe. This was a significant accident where the car was traveling at such a high speed that it smashed through a concrete wall and then hit a large tree, yet the driver walked away from the car with no permanent injury. He is appreciative of the safety and performance of the car and has asked if we can expedite delivery of his next Model S.‚Äù
REUTERS/Steve MarcusFederal prosecutors are close to finalizing a settlement with SAC Capital that would end a painful chapter for the embattled hedge fund, according to people familiar with the matter, who added that a deal could be announced as early as this week. Any settlement between the U.S. Attorney for New York's Southern District and SAC, which was indicted on criminal securities and wire fraud in July, would involve a guilty plea, according to one of these people, and a fine of more than a billion dollars, others familiar with the matter have said. The basic terms of the settlement have already been hammered out, one of these people added, but a number of more technical issues still need to be resolved. Spokesmen for the U.S. Attorney's Office and SAC declined to comment. For SAC, which manages about $13 billion, the admission of guilt is probably more significant than the payout. Although the exact details of the anticipated plea could not yet be determined, any admission of guilt will probably render SAC unable to manage public money in the future. That means the firm either will have to convert quickly to a so-called family office, solely managing founder Steve Cohen and his senior employees' money, or shut down entirely. If SAC opts to close, said securities lawyers and a person familiar with the matter, it can move its remaining capital and its staff into a new money-management firm with a new name. But even after that, Cohen, who was sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission in July for failure to supervise errant employees, faces the prospect of a securities-industry bar that would restrict his trading abilities dramatically. Prosecutors reportedly told SAC that any settlement deal would have to be completed before Nov. 18, which is when the federal trial against longtime SAC manager Michael Steinberg commences. Eyeing that date and aware of the firm's desire for resolution, SAC employees have been expecting a deal this week, according to someone who works there. The government has reportedly demanded a fine of $1.8 billion. SAC has held out for a figure lower than that, said someone familiar with the matter, and a deduction from the eventual fine of $616 million it paid earlier this year to settle related SEC charges. Whether they have prevailed, however, is not yet clear.
CNBCJeremy SiegelWharton School professor Jeremy Siegel told CNBC on Monday that the Dow Jones Industrial Average could rise 10 percent or more in 2014. That may not be on par with this year's roaring return but is still historically robust, he said, considering that 2013 has been an "extraordinary year" for stock gains. In a "Squawk Box" interview, Siegel said that the Dow could finish out 2013 with another 6 percent, on top of the blue-chip index's 25 percent gain year-to-date. "November and December are usually pretty good months," he said. "There's no major uncertainties that are hanging over the markets, at least in these two months coming up." Barring a major selloff this week, the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq will all be positive for September and October. That is relatively rare, happening only four other times in the past 30 years: 2010, 2007, 2006 and 1998. Looking ahead, Siegel also said he sees GDP accelerating next year to "3 [to] 3.5 percent from the 2 percent we're stuck in this year." That will make for a very "good climate for earnings growth," he added.

"Don't forget, the first rate hike is not expected‚Äîright now if you look at the futures market‚Äîuntil April or May of 2015." The Fed is scheduled to begin its two-day October meeting Tuesday.

Much has been made in the press about how NYSE margin debt is at an all-time high, suggesting that investors are excessively bullish. However, stock markets themselves are also at all-time highs ‚Äî so perhaps the level of margin debt doesn't really tell us much that we don't already know. A post on the blog Philosophical Economics (flagged by Josh Brown) explains the mechanism whereby increases in the stock market translate to increases in margin debt: Now, why does total margin debt rise with the level and total capitalization of the market? There is a simple, intuitive answer. ¬†In any environment, a certain percentage of investors borrow against their portfolios. ¬†They borrow for a number of reasons. ¬†Examples include: (1) They may be engaged in investment strategies that hedge and pare risk by applying leverage to uncorrelated assets. (2) Margin debt might be the cheapest type of debt they have access to, and therefore they may use it to pay off other more expensive debts. (3)¬†They might be waiting for money to arrive at a broker, and need temporary liquidity to fund purchases. Or (4), they might just be really bullish and really reckless. We should expect the amount of margin debt that these investors take on to vary with the size of the portfolios they are borrowing against. ¬†Thus, we should expect the¬†total quantity of margin debt¬†in existence to vary with the¬†total capitalization of the stock market (the sum of the value of all equity portfolios). ¬†That is roughly what we see. That brings us to the only margin debt chart that matters: NYSE margin debt as a percentage of stock market capitalization, which shows how the use of margin is growing¬†relative to the pace of the rise in stock prices. Philosphical Economics Why has this measure been rising? Philosophical Economics chalks it up to the evolving investment landscape: Hedge funds have grown dramatically since the early 1990s. ¬†The strategies they employ to smooth out and optimize their risk-adjusted returns involve more leverage than the rest of the market has traditionally used. Additionally, the cost of borrowing against a portfolio has fallen significantly since the early 1990s. ¬†Borrowing on margin is cheaper now than it has ever been, not only because interest rates are at record lows, but also because brokerage competition has produced an outcome where clients are offered much better terms. Finally, with the development and mass expansion of online trading, portfolios are easier to monitor and quickly adjust. ¬†This reduces the stress of being on margin.

REUTERS/Lucy NicholsonPuerto Rico's Javier Culson lies on the track next to Angelo Taylor (C) and Michael Tinsley (R) of the U.S. after the men's 400m hurdles final at the London 2012 Olympic Games at the Olympic Stadium August 6, 2012. Municipal bond funds saw their worst outflows ever in 2013. Fears over rising interest rates and the dire credit environment for Detroit and Puerto Rico combined to create 22-straight weeks of redemptions, totaling $58 billion. ‚ÄúIt's the worst period in my 25-year career,‚Äù Tom Metzold of Eaton Vance Management told Investment News' Jason Kephart. But Bloomberg's Michelle Kaske reports the run may be at an end: the discount-to-asset-value¬†of the largest exchange-traded fund tracking muni bonds has narrowed to July lows of 0.03%, compared with a gap of 2.86% in June. Kaske reports: "The shift suggests that buyers will return to local debt in the next few months, said Bart Mosley, co-president of Trident Municipal Research in¬†New York. ‚ÄúAt least it means that those outflows will subside,‚Äù Mosley said. ‚ÄúThe narrowing or the elimination of a discount on ETF products reflects the renewed comfort of investors with fixed-income generally.‚Äù The Fed has now repeatedly signaled it wants to hold interest rates at bay. And while there remains some uncertainty over the target and extent of haircuts in Detroit, investors seem to be taking a wait-and-see approach toward Puerto Rico, whose just above investment-grade rating S&amp;P confirmed last week. ‚ÄúThe market still has some long-term concerns about Puerto Rico, but there‚Äôs not a near-term event which might lead to some re-pricing of Puerto Rico debt,‚Äù BlackRock's Matthew Tucker told Kaske. Puerto Rico's El Nuevo Dia reported last week that Puerto Rican officials met with heads of major financial and industrial firms in New York to reassure them that fiscal reforms designed to reduce the country's large deficit are on track.
Former Amazon employee Eugene Wei has a thorough analysis of Amazon's business model, and why everyone seems to misunderstand the company.† Last week, Amazon reported its second straight quarterly loss. Instead of dumping the stock, investors bought more pushing Amazon to new heights and prompting analysts to slap $400+ price targets on it.† This oddity ó Amazon getting rewarded for not making money ó led to the usual jokes on Twitter about Amazon being a charitable organization, as well as skepticism that it can ever make money. Wei explains that both the jokes and the skepticism are wrong. Amazon is†profitable in its retail operations, but it's losing money overall because it's investing in big opportunities to expand globally and crank up sales.† He has a great analogy for explaining how Amazon works:† To me, a profitless business model is one in which it costs you $2 to make a glass of lemonade but you have to sell it for $1 a glass at your lemonade stand. But if you sell a glass of lemonade for $2 and it only costs you $1 to make it, and you decide business is so great you're going to build a lemonade stand on every street corner in the world so you can eventually afford to move humanity into outer space or buy a newspaper in your spare time, and that requires you to invest all your profits in buying up some lemon fields and timber to set up lemonade franchises on every street corner, that sounds like many things to me, but it doesn't sound like a charitable organization. Catch that? Amazon has a profitable business. It has figured out how to make money. Now, it's investing in expensive stuff like fulfillment centers to create a more profitable, global business.† His full analysis is worth a read, but if you're short on time, here are the key points: Read the full post here ª
San Francisco FedThe¬†results of the Dallas Fed's October Manufacturing Activity survey are out. The headline index fell to 3.6 from September's 12.8 reading. Economists predicted a much more moderate decline to 10.0. The drop puts the index below August's 5.0 level, and suggests that the pace of growth in Texas manufacturing is slowing. The Dallas Fed survey polls manufacturers across Texas, southern New Mexico, and northern Louisiana. Below is the full text of the release: Texas factory activity picked up further in October, according to business executives responding to the Texas Manufacturing Outlook Survey. The production index, a key measure of state manufacturing conditions, rose from 11.5 to 13.3, suggesting output increased at a slightly faster pace than in September. Other measures of current manufacturing activity also indicated a slightly stronger expansion in October. The new orders index came in at 6.2, slightly above its September level, and marked a sixth consecutive month of increased demand. The capacity utilization index edged up to 11.9, and the shipments index rose 3 points to 13.2. Perceptions of broader business conditions were less optimistic in October. The general business activity index remained positive but fell to 3.6 after rising sharply to 12.8 in September. The company outlook index posted a fifth consecutive positive reading but moved down to 5.4. Labor market indicators reflected continued employment growth and longer workweeks. The October employment index was 9.6, largely unchanged from its September level. Seventeen percent of firms reported hiring new workers compared with 7 percent reporting layoffs. The hours worked index turned positive for the first time in three months, coming in at 3.9, indicating an increase in average workweek length. Upward pressure on prices continued in October, and compensation costs picked up notably. The raw materials price index moved up to 22.7, posting its highest reading in nine months. The finished goods price index remained positive for the third month in a row but fell 7 points to 3.5. The wages and benefits index rose sharply from 9.7 to 20.4, reaching its highest level since July 2012. Looking ahead, 39 percent of respondents anticipate further increases in raw materials prices over the next six months, while 34 percent expect higher finished goods prices. Expectations regarding future business conditions remained optimistic in October. The indexes of future general business activity and future company outlook declined from September levels but remained in strongly positive territory. Most indexes for future manufacturing activity also fell while remaining solidly positive. The Dallas Fed conducts the Texas Manufacturing Outlook Survey monthly to obtain a timely assessment of the state‚Äôs factory activity. Data were collected Oct. 15‚Äì23, and 82 Texas manufacturers responded to the survey. Firms are asked whether output, employment, orders, prices and other indicators increased, decreased or remained unchanged over the previous month. Survey responses are used to calculate an index for each indicator. Each index is calculated by subtracting the percentage of respondents reporting a decrease from the percentage reporting an increase. When the share of firms reporting an increase exceeds the share reporting a decrease, the index will be greater than zero, suggesting the indicator has increased over the prior month. If the share of firms reporting a decrease exceeds the share reporting an increase, the index will be below zero, suggesting the indicator has decreased over the prior month. An index will be zero when the number of firms reporting an increase is equal to the number of firms reporting a decrease. Data have been seasonally adjusted as necessary.

Business Insider/Matthew Boesler, data from BloombergAll of a sudden, everybody is talking about the euro. The currency has risen 8% against the U.S. dollar since July 9, when selling induced by Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke's June 19 press conference ‚Äî in which he hinted at tapering quantitative easing, causing strength in the dollar ‚Äî culminated. Today, the euro trades just below $1.38. Steven Englander, global head of G10 FX strategy at Citi, just returned from client meetings in South America, and he said the thing everyone was asking about the most was the euro. "The bulk of questions received were on EUR/USD, and our views were into year end," he writes in a note. "Most clients were happy to see it lower, but conviction was low as to the timing of the move. Views for significant EUR/USD upside were again also limited. Several accounts were buying EUR/USD presently, but discussions of the trade tended to lack medium-term justifications, although several clients cited technical reasons. The dominant view was EUR/USD could rise to 1.40, although investors in European assets were looking to establish hedges on their underlying exposure." Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale global head of economics Michala Marcussen also says the number-one question from her clients is about the euro. In a note, she writes: TOP CLIENT QUESTIONS WHY IS THE EURO SO STRONG? Investor inflows is the most common answer Hitting a two-year high against the U.S. dollar last week of just over $1.38, euro strength appears to be defying the traditional fundamental explanations of the relative monetary policy stance, external balances and growth differentials. Foreign investor inflows - attracted by abating tail risks, attractive valuations and green shoots of recovery ‚Äì now appears the most common answer. There is an obvious, if undesirable, self correction mechanism to this logic, should foreign investors ultimately be disappointed by the euro area recovery. A scenario that becomes more likely, the longer euro strength continues.¬† SocGen global strategist Kit Juckes penned a note in response to Marcussen's, expanding on the reasons for the higher euro: I have been bandying around ultra-simple two-factor models of EUR/USD for a while. They help me to think about what kind of currency move I can expect from the two big drivers of the euro‚Äôs fortunes ‚Äì rate spreads, and risk aversion as shown by the 3-year Spain/German spread. The one below suggests that if the 'neutral' Spain/German spreads is 200 basis points, and 2-year swap rates are identical in the U.S. and euro area, EUR/USD will be at 1.34. That 'feels' high to lots of people, but when you run a current account surplus and employ a central bank in which Germany has a voice, it's what you get. Today, we are at 1.38, about 1% above the simplistic 'fair value'. The reason the fair value is so high is that 3-year Spain/German spreads have fallen to 165 basis points, the lowest level in 2 ¬Ω years, and 2-year euro rates are above U.S. ones. This is 'why' we are here. Juckes says the reason this caught everyone off guard is that "we didn‚Äôt expect that the market would be more hawkish about¬†ECB than Fed policy at a time when the euro area economy is barely growing, nor did we¬†expect to see the endless grind of Spanish bond out-performance go quite this far." In the week ended October 23, investors poured $5 billion into European equity funds, marking the biggest weekly inflow ever into the asset class. These funds have seen nothing but inflows for the past 17 weeks ‚Äî since the beginning of the second quarter, when PMI surveys suggested the eurozone was finally emerging from recession. Investor sentiment toward eurozone assets seems to have been spurred by recent improvements in the currency bloc's economic picture. "Why won't the euro go down when everyone says it will?" says Neville Hill, head of European economics at Credit Suisse. "The euro area's current account has skyrocketed to a record 2.5-3% of GDP...we think that's why euro shorts are consistently disappointed!" Matthew Boesler/Business Insider
Damir Sagolj / REUTERSAn official measures radiation on a car leaving the exclusion zone near the tsunami-crippled Daiichi nuclear power plant in Fukushima prefecture near the town of Tomioka September 13, 2013.  NIIGATA,†Japan†(Reuters) -†Tokyo†Electric Power Co &lt;9501.T&gt; must give a fuller account of the Fukushima disaster and address its "institutionalized lying" before it can expect to restart another nuclear station, the world's largest, said a local government official who holds an effective veto over the utility's revival plan. "If they don't do what needs to be done, if they keep skimping on costs and manipulating information, they can never be trusted,"†Niigata†Prefecture Governor†Hirohiko Izumida†told Reuters in an interview on Monday. Izumida must approve the embattled utility's plans to restart the reactors at Kashiwazaki Kariwa, the world's biggest nuclear complex on the†Japan†Sea coast some 300 kms (180 miles) northwest of†Tokyo. A former economy and trade ministry bureaucrat who has emerged as a leading critic of†Tokyo†Electric, or Tepco, Izumida said he would launch his own commission to investigate the causes and handling of the Fukushima crisis and whether strengthened regulatory safeguards were sufficient to prevent a similar disaster. Izumida, 51, declined to provide a timetable for completing that review - a process that could force the utility to scrap or abandon one of the key assumptions behind its turnaround plan. "If†Tokyo†Electric doesn't cooperate closely with the prefecture nothing will be solved," he said. "Unless we start we won't know," he added when asked how long his review could take. "If they cooperate with us, we will be able to proceed smoothly. If not, we won't." Even if†Japan's nuclear safety regulators approve Tepco's restart plans for its†Niigata†reactors, Izumida can effectively block it because of the utility's need to win backing from local officials. That gives Izumida, a political independent, a platform for calling for a wider reform of†Asia's largest listed electricity utility, which provides power to 29 million homes and businesses in and around†Tokyo. REMOVE TEPCO FROM FUKUSHIMA CLEAN-UP Izumida urged†Japan's government†to strip Tepco of responsibility for decommissioning the wrecked Fukushima reactors, and consider putting it through a taxpayer-funded bankruptcy similar to the process used to restructureJapan†Airlines &lt;9201.T&gt;. Without that kind of sweeping restructuring, Izumida said, Tepco could be left without the resources needed to ensure the safety of its remaining nuclear plants. In its current form, the utility threatens to be distracted by how to fund the dismantling of the Fukushima reactors over the next 30 years and the more immediate problem of containing contaminated†water†at the Fukushima site, Izumida said. "Unless we create a situation where 80-90 percent of their thinking is devoted to nuclear safety, I don't think we can say they have prioritized safety," he said. Izumida also called on the government to make more than 6,000 workers involved in decommissioning at Fukushima public employees. A Reuters investigation of working conditions at the plant found widespread abuses, including skimmed wages and the involvement of illegal brokers. "The workers at the plant are risking their health and giving it their all. They are out in the rain. They are out at night," Izumida said. "The government needs to respect their efforts and address the situation." A Tepco spokesman said the utility would cooperate with Izumida's investigation. "Safety is our utmost priority and we are not acting on an assumption of nuclear restarts," said†Yoshimi Hitotsugi. "We want to work on this issue while gaining the understanding of the local population and related parties." BEHIND SCHEDULE Tepco has posted more than $27 billion in losses since a massive earthquake and tsunami in March 2011 crippled the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear plant. The disaster knocked out cooling systems, triggered meltdowns in three reactors and a†radiation†release that forced more than 150,000 people from nearby towns to evacuate. It is behind schedule on its initial business turnaround plan, which had called for firing up at least one reactor at Kashiwazaki Kariwa by April. The utility says it can return to profitability in the business year to March without restarting the sprawling complex. But if all seven of the†Niigata†reactors were operational, Tepco says it would save $1 billion in monthly fuel costs. The utility's admission in July - following months of denials - that the†Fukushima plant†was leaking radioactive substances into the Pacific Ocean was evidence that Tepco has not changed, Izumida said, adding the utility developed a culture of "institutionalized lying." He said that unless the utility changes its corporate culture he won't be able to trust it to run the nuclear plant in the prefecture. "There are three things required of a company that runs nuclear power plants: don't lie, keep your promises and fulfill your social responsibility," Izumida said.

AP PhotoArgentina President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner's hopes of changing the country's constitution to enable her to run for a third term have been dashed. Yesterday, the country held elections for its upper and lower legislative houses, and President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner's party lost big. Her party garnered only 28% of the vote nation-wide, as opposed to the 54% it garnered in 2011. Across the country, newspapers are calling this the "el fin de la hegemonÌa K" ó "the end of the Kirchner hegemony." CFK needed to keep a two-thirds majority in Congress to be able to change the constitution with ease ó that's how she passed the nationalization of YPF and other controversial legislation. Now her party only has a slight majority in both houses. And what's worse for CFK, is that credible, as well as glamorous alternatives to her rule have been given even more legitimacy. Smiling, picture-perfect photos of Buenos Aires legislator Sergio Massa and his family are everywhere (check out† a bunch of the newspaper covers here). AP PhotoMassa's a former CFK friend ó a cabinet chief turned dissident. Now he leads an anti-Kirchner wing of the Peronist party, and as representative of Argentina's most populous province ó one that makes up 36% of the country's GDP ó he'll have even more power. He beat CFK's hand-picked candidate for the lower house post by 12 points. Massa has called for an end to arrogance and confrontation, which has given bond markets a signal that he'll negotiate payment for Argentina's debts, something CFK has not done. Because of that, bond markets are warm to him. From Bloomberg: Argentine dollar-bonds have rallied 14 percent since Massa won Aug. 11 primaries and the ruling alliance garnered about 30 percent of votes on expectations that Fernandez will be replaced by a more market-friendly president when she ends her mandate in 2015. Massa has yet to announce his candidacy for the presidency in 2015, but another opposition candidate, Buenos Aires Mayor Mauricio Macri, has. Macri and his PRO party are even farther away from CFK in terms of his politics, and they managed to score a bunch of seats in the upper and lower houses yesterday. Meanwhile, for the past few weeks CFK has been recovering from brain surgery due to a blood clot. She also has a heart condition, and some speculate that she'll need minor surgery for that in the coming months as well, according to MercoPress. Bottom line, if CFK wants to stay on top, she'll need to come up with a new strategy to do it.
REUTERS/Richard ClementPending home sales plunged 5.6% month-over-month in September. This missed expectations for the index to stay flat. Meanwhile, August's number was unchanged showed a 1.6% fall. Year-over-year the index was up 1.1%, compared with a 2.8% rise in August. This was the first time in 29 months that pending home sales weren't above year ago levels. "Declining housing affordability conditions are likely responsible for the bulk of reduced contract activity," said Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors in a press release. "In addition, government and contract workers were on the sidelines with growing insecurity over lawmakers‚Äô inability to agree on a budget. A broader hit on consumer confidence from general uncertainty also curbs major expenditures such as home purchases." Here's a look at the regional breakdown: In the Northeast, the pending home sales index (PHSI) fell 9.6% on the month, and is down 6.4% from a year ago. In the Midwest, the index is down 8.3% on the month, but up 5.7% from a year ago. In the South, the index fell 0.4% on the month, but is up 2.0% from a year ago. In the West, it is down 9.0% on the month, and is down 9.8% from a year ago. The PHSI looks at all homes where a contract has been signed but the sale is not complete. Investors watch this number because it is considered a leading indicator of the housing market. The Commerce Department calculates that 80% of signings will become existing home sales transactions within two months," points out Andrew Wilkinson of Miller Tabak in a note to clients. So this is likely to weigh on the existing sales numbers down the line.  Here's a look at the trajectory of the pending home sales index: NAR
Dealbook's Susanne Craig has a fascinating piece†this morning about Goldman Sachs redeeming itself since the financial crisis via charitable giving.† The Goldman Sachs Foundation has helped the investment banking giant establish itself as one of the biggest corporate philanthropists, the report said. † However, some Goldman insiders have become bitter because the foundation, which gives away hundreds of millions, has been getting more resources while other areas at the bank have seen cuts, according to DealBook citing unnamed executives. What's more is some of these Goldman insiders are also bitter that Dina Habib Powell, the head of Goldman's corporate engagement, has been receiving a sizeable paycheck even though her job isn't about making money.† From DealBook (emphasis ours): † But this is still Wall Street, where money is the ultimate measure of worth, and how it is allocated creates resentments. Executives inside the bank say the Goldman Sachs Foundation, the clearinghouse of the companyís giving, has been given more resources at a time when the bank itself has been cutting back sharply on expenses ó and people ó on big trading desks. This has created bitterness among some employees ó bitterness stoked by the favored status seemingly granted to Dina Powell, who runs the foundation. At a firm where pay is almost always tied to what money you bring in, Ms. Powell, who is in charge of giving money away, has made roughly $2 million annually in some recent years, according to people familiar with her compensation but not authorized to speak on the record. Her pay, which is considered high to some at the firm, is up there with some of the leaders of the best-paying charities, who receive between $1.8 million and $3 million, according to the Chronicle of Philanthropy. Those inclined to look for signs of status also note that the 20-year-old daughter of Goldmanís chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, worked as an intern in Ms. Powellís department last summer. Powell, 40,†joined Goldman in 2007. †In 2010, Goldman made her a "partner"óone of the most highly-coveted titles on Wall Street. Under her leadership, Goldman launched its 10,000 Women programóa $100 million initiative that trains underprivileged women running small businesses around the world.† Before she worked for Goldman, Powell was the Assistant Secretary of the State for Educational and Cultural Affairs during the George W. Bush administration. †She also served as the Deputy Undersecretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs. † Powell is married and has two daughters.  She graduated from the University of TexasóAustin.†

Barnshaws/FlickrSeptember U.S. industrial production data are out. Total production rose 0.6% in September. Economists predicted an unchanged pace of growth from August's 0.4% clip. Capacity utilization rose to 78.3% from an upward-revised 77.9%, exceeding economists' predictions for a smaller rise to 78.0%. That's the highest level since July 2008. Manufacturing production growth, however, slowed to 0.1% in September (economists predicted a 0.3% advance). August manufacturing production growth was revised down to 0.5% from 0.7%. Production of automotive products was up 12.9% from a year earlier in September, while textile production was down 5.4% year over year. Below is a breakdown of the data from the release: The production of consumer goods increased 0.8 percent in September but declined at an annual rate of 1.1 percent for the third quarter as a whole. The index for durable consumer goods advanced 0.7 percent in September, as a gain in the output of automotive products more than offset declines in the production of home electronics; appliances, furniture, and carpeting; and miscellaneous goods. The output of durable consumer goods increased at an annual rate of 2.1 percent for the third quarter as a whole. The production of nondurables rose 0.9 percent in September. The increase was driven by a gain in the output of energy products, which moved up 3.9 percent, while the output of non-energy nondurables decreased 0.2 percent, a third consecutive monthly decline. Within non-energy nondurables, the indexes for foods and tobacco and for chemicals both declined 0.3 percent. In contrast, the output of clothing increased 1.6 percent and was 4.5 percent above its September 2012 level. The output of nondurable consumer goods decreased at an annual rate of 2.0 percent for the third quarter as a whole. The output of business equipment moved up 1.2 percent in September and increased at an annual rate of 1.2 percent for the third quarter as a whole. All major categories of business equipment advanced in September. The production of transit equipment increased 2.3 percent and was 5.5 percent above its year-earlier level; the output of industrial and other equipment rose 1.2 percent in September, its first monthly gain since June; and the index for information processing equipment edged up 0.1 percent in September following an increase of 1.2 percent in August. The overall index for business equipment in September was 3.7 percent above its year-earlier level. The output of defense and space equipment rose 0.4 percent in September and was 1.8 percent above its September 2012 level. For the third quarter, the index increased at an annual rate of 4.2 percent. Among nonindustrial supplies, the output of construction supplies moved up 0.6 percent in September, its fourth consecutive monthly increase, and advanced at an annual rate of 4.8 percent in the third quarter. The production of business supplies rose 0.7 percent in September. The output of materials to be processed further in the industrial sector increased 0.3 percent in September and advanced at an annual rate of 4.2 percent for the third quarter. The gain in September was due to a 1.0 percent increase in the production of energy materials. For the third quarter as a whole, the index for energy materials moved up at an annual rate of 7.5 percent. The output of durable materials was unchanged in September following a gain of 1.2 percent in August. The production of equipment parts declined 0.2 percent in September, while the output of consumer parts and of other durable materials both edged up 0.1 percent. The production of nondurable materials moved down 0.4 percent in September; the indexes for textile materials and chemical materials both declined, and the index for paper materials was unchanged. This release was originally scheduled for October 17, but the Federal Reserve postponed it because the report relies on a number of government-released indicators that were delayed due to the government shutdown that spanned the first two weeks of the month. The data don't reflect the effects of the government shutdown. However, there have been signs of a slowdown in other measures of the economy prior to October, like nonfarm payrolls and core durable goods orders. Meanwhile, the first data releases covering the October period affected by the shutdown have been downright ugly. American manufacturing output contracted this month for the first time since September 2009, and consumer confidence plummeted. Still, Wall Street economists largely expect the American economy to accelerate in early 2014. However, a new "shadow consensus" predicting continued slow growth and monetary easing is beginning to emerge. Dominic Konstam, global head of rates research at Deutsche Bank, believes the U.S. economy may already be entering into a "late-cycle" stage. One of the major implications for markets is that the Fed may have missed its chance to taper back its quantitative easing program in September.
The S&amp;P 500 closed at an all-time high on Friday, leaving investors very happy and some market-watchers in awe. Two truly extraordinary stats about the market crossed Twitter this morning. The first came from @StockTwits, which pointed to J. Lyons Fund Management who observed that the S&amp;P 500 hasn't seen a single day in 2013 when it traded negative year-to-date.¬† That has only happened twice since 1960. The second came from CNBC's @CarlQuintanilla, who credits Peter Shack for observing that the S&amp;P 500 is just days away from closing positively in both September and October. "That's happened only 4 times in past 30 yrs." Bloomberg
S&amp;P 500 futures have been slowly trending lower all morning, but they just took a sharp turn downward and are now negative. Right now, futures are trading at 1752, down 0.1% from Friday's close and 10 points off the overnight highs. Gold, oil, and 10-year U.S. Treasury futures are all down slightly as well. The dollar is up marginally against both the euro and the yen. At 9:15 a.m. ET, September industrial production data are released. At 10 a.m., we get September pending home sales, and at 10:30 a.m., the Dallas Fed's October manufacturing activity survey. This week is the last major week of third quarter earnings reporting season. "27% of equity cap, 126 companies, is set to report," says Goldman Sachs strategist Amanda Sneider. "Half of Energy and Utilities market cap will announce results next week. 30% of the Health Care, Materials, and Info Tech sectors will also report." Sneider outlines the three biggest takeaways from Q3 earnings reporting so far in a note to clients: "(1) 3Q earnings positively surprise, driven by Financials and higher than expected margins; (2) Revenues have been in line with expectations and trailing four-quarter margins remain stable despite positive surprises in 3Q;¬†(3) Negative revisions to 4Q EPS estimates." In a separate note, Goldman Sachs chief U.S. equity strategist David Kostin said the¬†three questions dominating his discussions with clients¬†about the stock market over the past week were "(1) the forward path of the US equity market; (2) prospective return of the S&amp;P 500 compared with other global stock markets; and (3) investment strategies through year-end after a stellar 22% rally during the first 10 months of 2013." On the first question, Kostin says the debate among Goldman clients can be characterized in three words: "Fama vs. Shiller" (the names of two economists who won this year's Nobel Prize in economics).¬†Read more here ¬ª The chart below shows the drop in S&amp;P 500 futures.

The Federal Reserve shocked the world in September when it refrained from tapering its open-ended large-scale asset purchase program (LSAP).¬† Also known as quantitative easing, LSAP consists of monthly purchases of $85 billion worth of bonds in an effort to stimulate the economy. In the wake of the announcement, economists quickly began pushing back their initial tapering expectations to December.¬† And then those expectations got pushed back to March 2014, which is when current Vice Chair Janet Yellen is expected to be at the helm of the Fed. But in another twist, Morgan Stanley's Matthew Hornbach throws out the possibility that the Fed might wait until June 2014 to taper.¬† From Hornbach's latest note (emphasis added): The Case for the First Taper in June 2014What could keep the Treasury market supported beyond the end of 2013? Or what could send Treasury yields even lower than our expected range over the near-term ‚Äì i.e., below 2.20-2.40%? In our view, the market would have to shift the largest probability of tapering past the March 2014 FOMC meeting. What could cause that to happen? If the market comes to believe that the Fed needs to see acceleration in real GDP growth in order to feel comfortable tapering, the market will focus on the timing of when that growth acceleration is likely to show up in the data. If the market believes that the acceleration in real GDP growth is unlikely to show up in 4Q13 (Morgan Stanley economists believe 4Q13 real GDP growth is tracking below 2.0% annualized, currently), then 1Q14 is the first quarter where growth could accelerate above the recent 2% annualized trend. If the Fed waits until the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) reports real GDP growth for 1Q14 (end of April 2014 for advance release), it could possibly taper at the April 29-30 FOMC meeting. If it wants to wait for the first revision of 1Q14 GDP (end of May 2014) because of the downward revisions to 1Q13 that occurred this year, the Fed might not taper until the June 17-18 FOMC. Additionally, most GDP forecasts by economists currently assume that the law that triggers an automatic sequester in 2014 as a part of the Budget Control Act of 2011 will not be implemented to full effect in 2014. However, if the Congress is unable to agree on a delay to the sequester, it could lead to more fiscal drag in early 2014 than currently expected. Such a fiscal drag would be a headwind to the acceleration in growth that the Fed might be seeking. This may lead the Fed to delay tapering until much further beyond the first or second quarters of 2014 to better assess the negative consequences of the fiscal drag. While this is not the base cases of our economists, it is a plausible scenario the market may consider pricing in. This would take 10-year Treasury yields further below our 2.20-2.40% target range into year-end. As seen by the recent government shutdown, Congress has proven to America that it can't be counted on even when the economy is on the line.¬† As such, the odds of a June 2014 taper is certainly above zero.
Wikimedia CommonsEconomists and traders will be very busy digesting tons of fresh information on the economy. "[This] weekís data release calendar is heavier than usual because it contains reports that were postponed due to the government shutdown," said Credit Suisse's Jay Feldman. "October consumer and business surveys should be hit with government shutdown headwinds, but a gain in October vehicle sales should indicate consumer resilience. We look for another modest gain in September retail sales, moderate increases in September industrial production, and contained and subdued September CPI and PPI inflation reports. In addition, the questionable quality of the October official jobs report places a higher premium on next weekís October ADP employment report." That questionable October jobs report release has been delayed to Nov. 8 from its originally scheduled release date of Nov. 1. Here's your Monday Scouting Report: Top Story Economic Calendar Market Commentary The stock market established new all-time highs last week. And for the most part, Wall Street's top strategists are still bullish. "We remain comfortable being ìslow buyers of equitiesî even as the market remains close to all-time highs," said JP Morgan's Tom Lee. "Despite the doomsayers the worriers and those calling curtains on the rally, our clients continue to believe, as do we, the bias is to the upside for now," said BTIG's Dan Greenhaus. "If the central bank stays accommodative and earnings keep doing what theyíre doing, why not?"

The insanely-hot London housing market has become the subject of global fascination. But who's buying it all? Deutsche Bank is out with a new report on the London housing market, and it includes this fascinating chart, which breaks down origin of purchaser by price range. As you can see, at the low end, the dominant share of buyers is domestic UK buyers. But at the high end, UK-based purchasers make up a tiny slice of the pie. A massive swath of the buyers is Eastern European or Russian. Chinese and Middle Eastern buyers are also quite significant. Chinese buyers actually make up a bigger purchase of the slightly cheaper ranges. So basically, tons of Chinese buyers at the expensive levels, and then at the ultra-rich level it's a lot of Russian and Eastern European money. Deutsche Bank, Knight Frank And as for why they're buying so much. Lots for investments, and some are buying for their children. Deutsche Bank
Good news. The economic data is going to come hot and heavy this week as the floodgates re-open in the wake of the government shutdown. And fortunately, the data should give is some insight into what happened to the economy in October, while the government was shut down, and the flirted once again with breaching the debt ceiling. Sam Ro put together a great guide to all the data that's coming out this week. Among the big things we'll be watching: The ADP Jobs report on Wednesday (which will give us insight into the private sector), Chicago PMI on Thursday (regional manufacturing data) and the ISM on Friday, which will be one of our highest quality indicators for the month of October so far. Already we've had Markit's Flash PMI, which was not good. Here's the key chart (via SoberLook) indicating that manufacturers hit the skids during October amidst all the Washington stuff. Markit By the end of this week, we'll have a much better sense of how much the economy got derailed.
Here's a fascinating nugget from SocGen strategist Kit Juckes, who just spent some time in Dubai. Everyone knows that there's a huge real estate boom there again, but what's really interesting is why. It turns out that the Arab Spring has resulted in a lot of rich people in the region looking for a safe space to park their money, and however bubbly Dubai is, at least it's safer then their home country. Here's Juckes: In the spring of 2010, I managed to get stuck in Dubai thanks to† an Icelandic volcano. Dubai World had re-structured its debt, hitting financial markets at the end of November 2009, just days before similar concerns emerged about Greece's finances. That prompted the euro to fall from $1.50 to $1.20 in a matter of months.†††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††† This week, as I wandered around the region, I read reports of a 16% y/y increase in rents in Doha, an even bigger annual increase in footfall in Dubai shopping malls, and stories of booming real estate everywhere. It's not a bubble, it's a boom, the papers tell us. At first glance, my assumption was that this was Ben's mad monetary policy at work again as fixed exchange rates and zero Fed Funds, not to mention QE, do their thing. Here we go again, I thought. But there is an additional driver of demand that didn't exist in the mad credit frenzy of 2003-2008 - the influx of money and people that has come as a result of the Arab Spring. The rich are either sending their money to the Gulf, or sending themselves there too. It isn't easy to quantify but the planes are full, the hotels are booming and the anecdotal evidence is plain to see. This is one of the funny effects of global crises: They can produce bubbles in safe-haven countries. We've seen it in London and Germany, as European peripheral money sought out stable alternatives. And now it's being seen again as the rich citizens of troubled Arab Spring nations snap up property in the one area that's shown impressive stability and resilience.
YouTube"Any FOMC effort at balance will come across as hawkish." That's from Steven Englander at Citi, and it's a perfect preview of this week's Federal Reserve meeting, which takes place on Tuesday and Wednesday. Essentially, the market totally sees the Fed as being "on hold" and likely to not taper QE until March. Any hint that the Fed is chomping at the bit and being more balanced will be seen as hawkish.
China should dismantle its widely loathed residency registration system, which restricts access to medical insurance and other benefits for hundreds of millions of migrants, a government-affiliated think tank said, according to reports Monday. The Development Research Centre (DRC) of the State Council, or cabinet, issued a list of far-reaching reform proposals ahead of a key meeting of the ruling Communist party due next month, when changes are expected to be approved. Residency is a key controversy in China, where those who hold urban "hukou", or permits, have greater rights to state medical insurance, education and other services in each area, often excluding the hundreds of millions of people who have moved to China's cities over recent decades in search of better incomes. The DRC said the system should be replaced with a "basic social safety package", including pension and medical insurance, reports said. "All the benefits should be recorded in a personal social security card... that can be used nationwide," it said, according to excerpts published by the semi-official China News Service. "With the moving of the time and the expansion and improvement of the plan, it is expected to eventually replace the residency registration system." The measure is aimed at "promoting the free migration of the people, ensuring the basic social benefits for the citizens, optimising the distribution of resources and the improvement of productivity", the report added. The proposals have been submitted to the Communist party's third plenum meeting, the China Business News said Monday, adding that one of the authors was Liu He, who has a leading role in drafting the official reform plan and is a vice chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission, China's top economic planning agency. But several other competing sets of proposals are also expected to be made. Other ideas in the DRC report -- which did not give specific timetables -- included publishing officials' personal assets; restructuring the state-monopoly railway, energy, telecommunications and financial sectors to open them to competition, and making the yuan an international currency within 10 years. Property tax, which is being collected on a trial basis in some areas, should be rolled out nationwide and become a major income source for local governments, which should be banned from buying farmers' land at low prices and reselling it to developers at huge profits, it said.
