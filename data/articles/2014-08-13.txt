Thomson ReutersA pedestrian looks at an electronic board showing the stock market indices of various countries outside a brokerage in TokyoBy Wayne Cole SYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian shares pushed higher on Thursday after a flood of soft economic data led investors to wager on a ceaseless fountain of stimulus from major central banks, sending bond yields tumbling across the globe. An economic contraction in Japan, a shock fall in Chinese loans, a surprisingly dovish turn by the Bank of England and a sluggish reading on U.S. retail sales all combined to make any tightening in policy seem a very distant prospect. Indeed, investors suspect further easing is in the cards with data on euro zone growth and inflation later Thursday expected to pressure the European Central Bank for more action. Yields on Germany's two-year debt  actually went negative, meaning investors were paying for the privilege of lending Berlin money. "Risk-correlated assets have responded positively to weak activity data in the U.S., China, the euro area and Japan," summed up Barclays forex strategist Aroop Chatterje. "Euro area inflation remains subdued, which could put pressure on the ECB." But it is hardly alone.  "China's growth recovery remains fragile," he added. "More forceful policy easing such as interest rate cuts is likely needed for the government to achieve its growth target." The Bank of Korea is widely expected to cut its rates by 25 basis points to 2.25 percent on Thursday. That would be the lowest since early November 2010 and a marked turnaround from just a month ago. The thought of endless stimulus helped take the sting out of the disappointing economic news and underpinned equities. Japan's Topix  rose 0.6 percent, while the Australian market added  0.4 percent. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan  was up 0.1 percent. On Wall Street the Dow  ended Wednesday 0.55 percent firmer, while the S&amp;P 500  added 0.67 percent and the Nasdaq  1.02 percent. All 10 S&amp;P primary sector indexes gained, while the Nasdaq Biotech Index  led the charge with a 2.1 percent advance. MSCI's world stock index  rose 0.6 percent. Brazil was one of the few markets to lose ground as news that presidential candidate Eduardo Campos was killed in a plane crash knocked the Bovespa index  down 1.5 percent.  NO HIKES HERE Bond investors were also enticed by the outlook for easy money as subdued U.S. retail sales led markets to again push back the day when the Federal Reserve might first raise rates. Fed fund futures for June next year  closed at their highest in over two months at 99.75, implying a rate of just 0.25 percent. Two-year U.S. Treasury yields dived to their lowest close in nine weeks at 0.4159 percent , rallying from a top of 0.59 percent in just 10 sessions. Across the Atlantic, the Bank of England caused a major surprise by slashing its forecast for wage growth and saying higher rates hinged largely on an improved outlook for pay. With traders abandoning bets for a near-term hike, yields on two-year gilts  plunged 10 basis points to 0.719 percent, the biggest daily fall since late June 2013. The pound dropped to its lowest in four months around $1.6680 . It also plumbed a near seven-week low at 80.20 pence per euro  and slid 0.7 percent on the yen to 170.79 . The setback for sterling helped the dollar index  edge up to 81.611. The euro held steady at $1.3364 , though it could come under pressure if growth and inflation figures later in the day prove soft.  In commodity markets, worries about Chinese demand sent copper to a seven-week low below $6,874 per metric tons (7577 tons) . Spot gold, in contrast, found support from the outlook for loose monetary policy and edged up to $1,311.40 an ounce . Prices for Brent crude oil  touched a 13-month trough at $102.37 a barrel before steadying at $103.99. U.S. crude  was down 21 cents at $97.38.  (Editing by Shri Navaratnam) FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersA General Electric Company (GE) logo is seen on a toggle switch package in New York(Reuters) - General Electric Co  is reportedly in talks with Sweden's Electrolux AB  and Quirky Inc to sell its household appliances unit, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Sale of the century-old appliances business may fetch about $2 billion, Bloomberg quoted the people as saying. (http://bloom.bg/1lVXmEj) The business sells home appliances under the GE Monogram, GE Cafe and Hotpoint brands. The U.S. conglomerate recently decided to try selling its home appliances unit again as Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Immelt focuses on industrial operations, Bloomberg reported. Quirky, a consumer development startup, will tie up with private-equity firms to acquire a majority stake in the business, Bloomberg said, citing the sources. GE spokesman Seth Martin declined to comment. GE has outlined plans to divest $4 billion worth of industrial businesses this year to focus its portfolio on businesses with high returns. Electrolux could not immediately be reached for a comment. Quirky was not available to comment outside of normal business hours.

REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch On Thursday we'll get the freshest GDP data for Europe. And it's not expected to be good. We wrote a few days ago, about how Europe's huge economic policy failures were about to be on full display with these reports. Essentially, Europe got one thing right in the last few years, when in the summer of 2012, Mario Draghi put an end to the sovereign debt crisis by implicitly backstopping all the countries. But since then there's been no substantial economic recovery at all, and nothing good is even in sight. As for tomorrow, economists expect mere 0.1% growth. In Germany they actually expect economic contraction. And France is only expected to grow by 0.3%. Just really dismally low numbers all around. FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Nikita Paukov Russian convoy of trucks carrying humanitarian aid for Ukraine stops along a road in the city of Voronezh August 12, 2014. A mysterious convoy of 280 Russian trucks that have been driving toward the Ukrainian border could lead to outright military conflict, according to a note from Nomura senior political analyst Alastair Newton. Moscow claims the trucks contain 2,000 tons of supplies including cereals, sugar, baby food, and medical supplies and are part of a Red Cross-endorsed aid mission to war-torn eastern Ukraine. The Red Cross has denied its involvement, however, and there are reports that the trucks are military vehicles painted white with no license plates and that soldiers were seen operating them. Newton wrote in a Wednesday note that most investors have not recognized how bad this could be: "Markets appear to take the view that the imminent arrival of a Russian 'humanitarian aid' convoy in eastern Ukraine marks a de-escalation in tensions. In my opinion, as Moscow appears to be acting without co-ordinating appropriately with either Kiev or the Red Cross, which is not only unproven but also potentially dangerously complacent. The convoy may be just what Moscow claims; but – reminiscent of South Ossetia in August 2008 – it may also be designed to try to provoke Kiev into actions which would give Russia a pretext for military intervention." The supposed aid convoy was reportedly at a Russian military base 200 miles east of the border on Wednesday night, reports Neil MacFarquhar of The New York Times, and Moscow has refused to say where it is headed. Kiev and the West warn that the convoy may be a provocation as Russia could send the trucks into Ukraine without inspection — a crucial requirement for the Red Cross to take responsibility for the convoy. “The Russians and the Ukrainians have not agreed on the first step,” Pascal Cuttat, the head of the Red Cross delegation in Moscow, told The Times. The approach of the convoy presents Kiev with a dilemma. Ukraine says it fears it could become the focus of tension and conflict once on its soil and provide pretext for a Russian armed incursion. At the same time, Kiev does not want to seem to be blocking aid and providing a moral basis for Kremlin action. Russia, which sees Russian-speakers in the east under threat from a government it considers chauvinistic, said any suggestion of a link between the convoy and an invasion plan was absurd. Ukraine Defense MinistryThe military situation in eastern Ukraine, according to Ukraine.A presidential spokesman said that the Ukrainians, at a meeting late on Tuesday night, had agreed to accept the aid for Luhansk region in a bid to prevent "a full-scale invasion" by Russia. Four months of fighting in the east has produced a humanitarian crisis in parts of eastern Ukraine. People in the main cities of Donetsk and Luhansk, on the border with Russia, are suffering acute shortages of water, food and electricity. The last few weeks has seen significant government successes against rebels who have abandoned a string of towns under heavy fire. Kiev says rebel leaders, some of whom are Russians and who seek union with Russia, are receiving arms from Moscow, something the Kremlin denies. U.N. human rights spokeswoman Cecile Pouilly said the estimated death toll had risen to 2,086 as of Aug. 10 from 1,129 on July 26. The figures included Ukrainian soldiers, rebel groups and civilians, but were "very conservative estimates." "This corresponds to a clear escalating trend," she told Reuters in response to an inquiry. Wednesday saw increased Russian military activity by the border, and there is the ongoing specter that Russia is fully capable of invading Ukraine from several angles if Vladimir Putin decided to go with Plan B. "Absent more transparency in Moscow and full co-operation with Kiev and the Red Cross, I believe that the Russian aid convoy, no matter how innocent in reality, runs the risk of triggering a dangerously volatile situation once it gets to the border," Newton concludes. "As such, it poses a potential threat to which markets should pay careful attention." FREE AppDownload
Wikimedia CommonsRisk premiums. I don’t know anyone who seriously maintains that risk premiums are anywhere close to normal. They more closely resemble what we see just before a major bear market kicks in. Which doesn’t mean that they can’t become further compressed. My good friend John Hussman certainly wouldn’t argue for such a state of affairs, and this week for our Outside the Box we let John talk about risk premiums. Hussman is the founder and manager of the eponymous Hussman Funds, at www.Hussmanfunds.com. Let me offer a few cautionary paragraphs from his letter as a way to set the stage. I particularly want to highlight a quote from Raghuram Rajan, who impressed me with his work and his insights when we spent three days speaking together in Scandinavia a few years ago. At the time he was a professor at the University of Chicago, before he moved on to see if he could help ignite a fire in India. Raghuram Rajan, the governor of the Reserve Bank of India and among the few economists who foresaw the last financial crisis, warned last week that “some of our macroeconomists are not recognizing the overall build-up of risks. We are taking a greater chance of having another crash at a time when the world is less capable of bearing the cost. Investors say ‘we will stay with the trade because central banks are willing to provide easy money and I can see that easy money continuing into the foreseeable future.’ It’s the same old story. They add ‘I will get out before everyone else gets out.’ They put the trades on even though they know what will happen as everyone attempts to exit positions at the same time.” As a market cycle completes and a bull market gives way to a bear market, you’ll notice an increasing tendency for negative day-to-day news stories to be associated with market “reactions” that seem completely out of proportion. The key to understanding these reactions, as I observed at the 2007 peak, is to recognize that abrupt market weakness is generally the result of low risk premiums being pressed higher. Low and expanding risk premiums are at the root of nearly every abrupt market loss. Day-to-day news stories are merely opportunities for depressed risk premiums to shift up toward more normal levels, but the normalization itself is inevitable, and the spike in risk premiums (decline in prices) need not be proportional or “justifiable” by the news at all. Remember this, because when investors see the market plunging on news items that seem like “nothing,” they’re often tempted to buy into what clearly seems to be an overreaction. We saw this throughout the 2000-2002 plunge as well as the 2007-2009 plunge. Yesterday evening, another astute market observer in the form of my good friend Steve Cucchiaro, founder of Windhaven, joined a few other friends for an entertaining steak dinner; and then we talked long into the night about life and markets. It is difficult to be “running money” at a time like this. The market is clearly getting stretched, but there is also a serious risk that it will run away for another 10 or 15%. If you are a manager, you need to be gut-checking your discipline and risk strategies. If you’re a client, you need to be asking your manager what his or her risk strategy is. It’s not a matter of risk or no risk but how you handle it. What is your discipline? What non-emotional strategy instructs you to enter markets and to exit markets? Is it all or nothing, or is it by sector? Are you global? If so, do you have appropriate and different risk premiums embedded in your strategies? Just asking… John’s piece today should at least get you thinking. That’s what Outside the Box is supposed to do. [Editors Note: Mr. Mauldin's introduction was edited for length.] By John P. Hussman, Ph.D. Through the recurrent bubbles and collapses of recent decades, I’ve often discussed what I call the Iron Law of Finance: Every long-term security is nothing more than a claim on some expected future stream of cash that will be delivered into the hands of investors over time. For a given stream of expected future cash payments, the higher the price investors pay today for that stream of cash, the lower the long-term return they will achieve on their investment over time. The past several years of quantitative easing and zero interest rate policy have not bent that Iron Law at all. As prices have advanced, prospective future returns have declined, and the “risk premiums” priced into risky securities have become compressed. Based on the valuation measures most strongly correlated with actual subsequent total returns (and those correlations are near or above 90%), we continue to estimate that the S&amp;P 500 will achieve zero or negative nominal total returns over horizons of 8 years or less, and only about 2% annually over the coming decade. See Ockham’s Razor and The Market Cycle to review some of these measures and the associated arithmetic.   What quantitative easing has done is to exploit the discomfort that investors have with earning nothing on safe investments, making them feel forced to extend their risk profile in search of positive expected returns. The problem is that there is little arithmetic involved in that decision. For example, if a “normal” level of short-term interest rates is 4% and investors expect 3-4 more years of zero interest rate policy, it’s reasonable for stock prices to be valued today at levels that are about 12-16% above historically normal valuations (3-4 years x 4%). The higher prices would in turn be associated with equity returns also being about 4% lower than “normal” over that 3-4 year period. This would be a justified response. One can demonstrate the arithmetic quite simply using any discounted cash flow approach, and it holds for stocks, bonds, and other long-term securities. [Geek's Note: The Dornbusch exchange rate model reflects the same considerations.] However, if investors are so uncomfortable with zero interest rates on safe investments that they drive security prices far higher than 12-16% above historical valuation norms (and at present, stocks are more than double those norms on the most reliable measures), they’re doing something beyond what’s justified by interest rates. Instead, what happens is that the risk premium – the compensation for bearing uncertainty, volatility, and risk of extreme loss – also becomes compressed. We can quantify the impact that zero interest rates should have on stock valuations, and it would take decades of zero interest rate policy to justify current stock valuations on the basis of low interest rates. What we’re seeing here – make no mistake about it – is not a rational, justified, quantifiable response to lower interest rates, but rather a historic compression of risk premiums across every risky asset class, particularly equities, leveraged loans, and junk bonds. My impression is that today’s near-absence of risk premiums is both unintentional and poorly appreciated. That is, investors have pushed up prices, but they still expect future returns on risky assets to be positive. Indeed, because all of this yield seeking has driven a persistent uptrend in speculative assets in recent years, investors seem to believe that “QE just makes prices go up” in a way that ensures a permanent future of diagonally escalating prices. Meanwhile, though QE has fostered an enormous speculative misallocation of capital, a recent Fed survey finds that the majority of Americans feel no better off compared with 5 years ago. We increasingly see carry being confused with expected return. Carry is the difference between the annual yield of a security and money market interest rates. For example, in a world where short-term interest rates are zero, Wall Street acts as if a 2% dividend yield on equities, or a 5% junk bond yield is enough to make these securities appropriate even for investors with short horizons, not factoring in any compensation for risk or likely capital losses. This is the same thinking that contributed to the housing bubble and subsequent collapse. Banks, hedge funds, and other financial players borrowed massively to accumulate subprime mortgage-backed securities, attempting to “leverage the spread” between the higher yielding and increasingly risky mortgage debt and the lower yield that they paid to depositors and other funding sources. We shudder at how much risk is being delivered – knowingly or not – to investors who plan to retire even a year from now. Barron’s published an article on target-term funds last month with this gem (italics mine): “JPMorgan's 2015 target-term fund has a 42% equity allocation, below that of its peers. Its fund holds emerging-market equity and debt, junk bonds, and commodities.” On the subject of junk debt, in the first two quarters of 2014, European high yield bond issuance outstripped U.S. issuance for the first time in history, with 77% of the total represented by Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain. This issuance has been enabled by the “reach for yield” provoked by zero interest rate policy. The discomfort of investors with zero interest rates allows weak borrowers – in the words of the Financial Times – “to harness strong investor demand.” Meanwhile, Bloomberg reports that pension funds, squeezed for sources of safe return, have been abandoning their investment grade policies to invest in higher yielding junk bonds. Rather than thinking in terms of valuation and risk, they are focused on the carry they hope to earn because the default environment seems "benign" at the moment. This is just the housing bubble replicated in a different class of securities. It will end badly.  Raghuram Rajan, the governor of the Reserve Bank of India and among the few economists who foresaw the last financial crisis, warned last week that "some of our macroeconomists are not recognizing the overall build-up of risks. We are taking a greater chance of having another crash at a time when the world is less capable of bearing the cost. Investors say 'we will stay with the trade because central banks are willing to provide easy money and I can see that easy money continuing into the foreseeable future.' It's the same old story. They add 'I will get out before everyone else gets out.' They put the trades on even though they know what will happen as everyone attempts to exit positions at the same time." While we’re already observing cracks in market internals in the form of breakdowns in small cap stocks, high yield bond prices, market breadth, and other areas, it’s not clear yet whether the risk preferences of investors have shifted durably. As we saw in multiple early selloffs and recoveries near the 2007, 2000, and 1929 bull market peaks (the only peaks that rival the present one), the “buy the dip” mentality can introduce periodic recovery attempts even in markets that are quite precarious from a full cycle perspective. Still, it's helpful to be aware of how compressed risk premiums unwind. They rarely do so in one fell swoop, but they also rarely do so gradually and diagonally. Compressed risk premiums normalize in spikes. As a market cycle completes and a bull market gives way to a bear market, you’ll notice an increasing tendency for negative day-to-day news stories to be associated with market “reactions” that seem completely out of proportion. The key to understanding these reactions, as I observed at the 2007 peak, is to recognize that abrupt market weakness is generally the result of low risk premiums being pressed higher. Low and expanding risk premiums are at the root of nearly every abrupt market loss. Day-to-day news stories are merely opportunities for depressed risk premiums to shift up toward more normal levels, but the normalization itself is inevitable, and the spike in risk premiums (decline in prices) need not be proportional or “justifiable” by the news at all. Remember this because when investors see the market plunging on news items that seem like “nothing,” they’re often tempted to buy into what clearly seems to be an overreaction. We saw this throughout the 2000-2002 plunge as well as the 2007-2009 plunge. As I’ve frequently observed, the strongest expected market return/risk profile is associated with a material retreat in valuations that is then joined by an early improvement across a wide range of market internals. These opportunities occur in every market cycle, and we have no doubt that we will observe them over the completion of the present cycle and in those that follow. In contrast, when risk premiums are historically compressed and showing early signs of normalizing even moderately, a great deal of downside damage is likely to follow. Some of it will be on virtually no news at all, because that normalization is baked in the cake, and is independent of interest rates. All that’s required is for investors to begin to remember that risky securities actually involve risk. In that environment, selling begets selling. Remember: this outcome is baked in the cake because prices are already elevated and risk premiums are already compressed. Every episode of compressed risk premiums in history has been followed by a series of spikes that restore them to normal levels. It may be possible for monetary policy to drag the process out by helping to punctuate the selloffs with renewed speculation, but there’s no way to defer this process permanently. Nor would the effort be constructive, because the only thing that compressed risk premiums do is to misallocate scarce savings to unproductive uses, allowing weak borrowers to harness strong demand. We don’t believe that risk has been permanently removed from risky assets. The belief that it has is itself the greatest risk that investors face here.

OverstockOverstock.com CEO Patrick Byrne says Bitcoin holders have boosted his company's bottom line as a reward for his decision earlier this year to become the first major retailer to accept the digital currency. Reached by phone by Business Insider Tuesday, Byrne confirmed a report from Reuters' Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss that Bitcoin sales had exceeded $2 million since the Utah-based company began accepting the  cryptocurrency in January. He added that he expected up to $8 million in total sales for the year, and forecast Bitcoin revenues would be responsible for $0.04 in earnings per share.  Byrne told Chavez-Dreyfuss he expects total 2014 earnings attributable to shares to reach $0.75-$0.89. In 2013 the company had diluted full-year earnings attributable to common shares of $3.64. The average daily sales clip has now reached $15,000 a day, or $300,0000 per month, he said, though that rate was only recently achieved.  "What I get at conferences is, 'I switched my purchases to you online as a show of support,' " he told BI. "That’s what I get in the Bitcoin community. It's become part of the Bitcoin ethic to go and buy something on Overstock.com." "We’re associated with Bitcoin at this point," he added.  Almost 90% of Overstock's Bitcoin shoppers are male, but they're often buying products like bedding or furniture more regularly purchased by women, Byrne said. The average size of a Bitcoin order is $240 versus $165 for regular items.  Overstock saw $330 million in revenues in its quarter ended July 28, and that there is no plan to breakout Bitcoin volumes in quarterly filings — at 1/4 of 1%, the overall amount remains insignificant to topline data. "There's a ramp to it," he said.  Besides Overstock, 2014 has also seen Dell, Dish Network, Newegg and Reddit announce they would accept Bitcoin payments.   FREE AppDownload
Flickr/kryptoFA Insights is a daily newsletter from Business Insider that delivers the top news and commentary for financial advisors.  The Recent Junk-Bond Sell-Off Is A Good Reminder Of The Potential Volatility Of The Asset Class (BlackRock) Recently there has been a high-yield sell-off. No doubt the elevated geopolitical risk, the Argentina default, and weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs report contributed to this, writes BlackRock's Matthew Tucker, CFA. In the past few months, BlackRock has been neutral on high yield because it has "offered more income potential than other asset classes" and it remains a "potential source of income in a diversified portfolio." However, the potential price appreciation is limited. "The recent sell-off is also a good reminder to investors of the potential volatility of the asset class," writes Tucker. "Given current yields, investors have to weigh whether they are being paid enough to take on this volatility and the underlying credit risk. Another consideration is whether recent price movements represent a temporary setback for the high yield market or the beginning of a broader re-pricing of corporate bonds. Given overall economic conditions I doubt that there will be any contagion into investment grade debt. For now, I continue to be neutral on high yield."  BlackRockBloomberg, Barclays and BlackRock as of 8/7/2014 There Are Opportunities In The Misunderstood Alternative Asset Management Industry (Morningstar) Stephen Ellis writes that the "alternative management industry is structurally attractive and generally misunderstood by investors" because it is relatively new and the accounting is rather complex. Additionally he writes that "investors do not fully appreciate the business quality or growth prospects for the biggest and best alternative managers" which have for the most part "greatly" expanded beyond their "initial roots in private equity." "The sell side has made some attempts to value the industry using a modified sum-of-the-parts model, but we think that this methodology only adds to the confusion as it deeply undervalues incentive income and relies too heavily on accrued incentive income (which, in our view, is too volatile a metric to be useful)." Some Bond Investors Are Ignoring A Lurking Risk (AllianceBernstein) In the current low-rate environment junk bonds have become popular. "But market complacency has caused callable-bond investors to ignore a lurking risk: duration extension in a rising-rate scenario," writes Ivan Rudolph-Shabinsky at AllianceBernstein Blog. And issuers end up with the "upper hand.""Historically, high-yield callable bonds’ yield advantage over government bonds provided a cushion against rising rates. But with this yield advantage diminished today, that cushion is not as large. At the same time, rising interest rates often dictate the decision an issuer makes with its callable bonds."If rates and yields rise enough, issuers will likely choose to not call their bonds until a later call date or simply wait until the maturity date to refinance. Investors could be left holding on to bonds they didn't plan to own so long — bonds now trading at lower prices due to rising yields. And if the bond isn’t called, investors can’t reinvest the proceeds in newer bonds with higher yields. This is known as extension risk." Tell Your Clients About The Benefits Of Not Retiring At Age 66 (Financial Planning) It's an unpleasant reality, but many clients might now have to work past their expected retirement age, though they might not be considering this possibility. Financial Planning highlights a few key ways that advisers can help clients better understand the circumstances.  Only 50% of U.S. households are expected to maintain their standard of living upon retirement at the age of 66. However, if these same people delay retirement by 4 years, then "86% can expect to enjoy a comfortable retirement." The longer they work, the more then can save. If your clients don't take Social Security immediately, their payout and cost-of-living adjustments will keep growing. Additionally, delaying retirement "means that savings continue to grow." If your client is still working after the age of 70 and a half, they can "defer 401K withdrawals until April 1st of the year they retire." Clients Won't Listen To Your Advice If Your Tone Is Wrong (The Wall Street Journal) "If you don't strike the right tone, your advice won't be heard no matter how good it is," Karol Ward, a New York psychotherapist, told the WSJ's Veronica Dagher. But if you can strike the right tone, client will be "more loyal and apt to refer the advisor's services to their friends." Sometimes advisers use defensive tones when "clients question an advisor's recommendation," but a better response would be to "explain the thinking behind the investment" and to express that you understand why the client is concerned. If advisers believe that they have "offended a client with their tone, it's best to address it directly and promptly," and say something like, "I sometimes share too much technical information. I hope that doesn't come across as condescending — that's not my intention. My desire is to provide the best level of insight and wisdom to your particular situation." FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Steve MarcusJohn Chambers, chairman and CEO of Cisco SystemsCisco CEO John Chambers had some disappointing things to say during his company's quarterly earnings conference call. "Latin America declined 6% with ongoing pressures in some of the largest countries including a decline of 13% in our business in Brazil," said Chambers. China got slammed with sales down 23% in the region. As a global provider of networking systems, Cisco serves as a valuable bellwether of economic activity. It's worth noting that Cisco's operations in China have more to do with industry-specific woes rather than broader economic trends. "Cisco executives have publicly blamed the company's disappointing results, in part, on disclosures about surveillance activities by the National Security Agency, which they say worry Chinese customers," said CNBC's Mark Berniker and Josh Lipton. Looking forward, Chambers warned he saw no material rebound in emerging market conditions. "Unfortunately as we look out, we don't see emerging markets growth for several quarters," he said. "We believe it possibly could get worse." Barron's Tiernan Ray, who was also listening to the call, noted that in the emerging markets "15 of the nations there collectively declining in order rate by 9%." Once the world's most reliable source of growth, the emerging markets have run into all sorts of problems in recent years with growth slowing while inflation remains high. FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersThe American Apparel factory headquarters is pictured in Los Angeles(Reuters) - Struggling retailer American Apparel Inc  named Google Inc  executive Laura Lee as the second woman director on its board. Lee is head of East Coast content partnerships for Google/YouTube. The company, which for years aired racy ads and battled sexual harassment lawsuits, last month appointed Colleen Brown, former Fisher Communications Inc chief executive, in a board reshuffle. American Apparel is still looking for a replacement for its CEO and founder Dov Charney, who was suspended for allegedly misusing corporate funds and helping spread nude photos of a former employee. The hipster retailer on Tuesday reported a bigger-than-expected loss for the second quarter ended June 30 and said it was delaying filing its full financial results as its new board needed additional time to review them.

AP/Charlie RiedelI was recently sitting at a conference table with two men and two women. Both guys were wearing suits. One of the ladies asks, “Can you tell what kind of suits these guys are wearing? How much do you think they cost?” Hmm. Field test. Well, the one guy was wearing a Suit Supply suit. I could tell immediately by the on-trend light navy fabric and the shape of the lapels – oversized but in a high-fashion way, not an old-fashioned way. He was in his mid-20s and was hip to the blog game, but he wasn’t spending big money on Italian suits. The other guy was slightly older and wearing a slightly more conservative suit. The dark pinstripe fabric was a little too rich and sheen-y for Brooks Brothers, and it looked more Italian than British. My guess was Canali. It was Brioni — which kind of surprised me. Pretty close though, all things considered. So that conversation got me thinking. What are the quality hallmarks of a fine suit? Are they noticeable to the average person? Do they matter? To whom? Before proceeding — this piece is not meant to talk down on cheap suits. In fact, I own a couple of very cheap suits (one from Uniqlo and one from Macy’s Inc.). I think a cheap suit is perfect for a trendier piece that you won’t get much use out of. For example, I scored this white linen suit for less than $100 on clearance. With the proper alterations, it looks like a much finer suit. As we’ve said a million times, it’s not so much about what you’re wearing, but about how you’re wearing it. With all that said, this is a quick piece on about easy ways to spot a cheap suit. TSBmen Do the buttons look cheap, flimsy, and painted? They probably are. They’re also very breakable. Good news — it’s easy to upgrade them to genuine horn. TSBmen Classic cheap Hong Kong tailor move. TSBmen Cheap linings are usually made of polyester, which traps heat and doesn’t breathe at all. It’s especially bad if it makes a “scrunchy” or “swishy” sound when you move it around.  TSBmen Just avoid shiny, stiff, sweaty synthetic fibers. Go all natural. And a suit should be cut slightly more precisely than “Small,” “Medium,” or “Large.” It’s not a T-shirt, so don’t buy it like one. TSBmen The roughly 3 1/2 yards of cloth it takes to make a suit is the majority of its cost. A cheap manufacturer will cut all the excess — including the fabric under the hem needed to lengthen the trousers and the fabric inside the seat needed to let out the waist.  TSBmen On top of providing durability and shapeliness to the garment, a chest canvas can also physically determine the angle and placement of the lapel roll line (all the way to the button stance). Crappy fused-front jackets can lose their proper roll and begin to close up, especially if not pressed properly. TSBmen This is the sign of a “fused front” (ie. glued together) chest piece. The chemicals used in dry-cleaning can affect the adhesion of this fusing, causing it to bubble up like a do-it-yourself window tint. TSBmen A low armhole is just bad design. It’s a carry-over from old-school patterns that weren’t adjusted for the more active lifestyle of today’s modern man. Not only do they look boxy and unshapely, they also restrict a man’s range of motion, causing a wing-like shape that pulls the jacket up when lifting an arm.  TSBmen The lapel is a focal point of the suit. It should have a soft, gradual, three-dimension roll that gives dimension and life to the jacket. A cheap one has a stiff crease caused by ironing a glued-back fabric. TSBmen The shoulders are a critical point of a suit. They should have a clean smooth line. Not a bumpy mess like Towni’s suit from H&amp;M that has been to the cleaners one too many times.

Thomson ReutersA general view of the lobby outside of the Carlyle Group offices in WashingtonNEW YORK (Reuters) - Buyout firm Carlyle Group LP  has hired banks for an initial public offering of Axalta Coating Systems LLC, according to people familiar with the matter, just a year and a half after it acquired the company from Dupont  for $4.9 billion. Citigroup Inc and Goldman Sachs Group Inc  have been given leading roles in the potential IPO of the performance coatings company, the people said on Wednesday. The IPO could raise as much as $1 billion, one of the people added. The sources asked not to be identified because the discussions are private. Bloomberg News reported on Axalta's IPO preparations earlier on Wednesday. Carlyle, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs declined to comment, while an Axalta spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Based in Philadelphia, Axalta makes liquid and powder coatings for the automotive and general transportation industries. It operates 35 manufacturing centers and does business in more than 130 countries, according to its website. Private equity firms typically hold on to companies between three and five years before they sell them. Carlyle's plans to take Axalta public in such a short time frame reflect the strength of the equity markets as well the private equity firm's confidence in Axalta's prospects as a public company. These plans, however, may not necessarily lead to a quick exit for Carlyle. For example, it took the Washington, D.C.-based firm more than six years for it to sell its shares in Hertz Global Holdings Inc . Carlyle took Hertz public in November 2006, just seven months after it acquired the company together with Clayton Dubilier &amp; Rice LLC and Merrill Lynch Private Equity in a $15 billion deal. Other private equity firms have also rushed to take some of their biggest portfolio companies public. Apollo Global Management LLC  floated oil and gas producer EP Energy Corp  in the stock market in January, just eight months after acquiring it from Kinder Morgan Inc  for $7.15 billion.

Reuters, Marcos Brindicci An Argentine propaganda poster depicting American Judge Thomas Griesa as a vulture.Political theater in Argentina is reaching a fever pitch, and you need only check out this picture of American Judge Thomas Griesa's head on the body of a vulture to get a sense of how intense things are getting. (Via Shane Ferro) The poster says "Griesa wants your house, your job and your food." You'll also note that in the bottom left corner there's a picture of President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, embracing her husband late-President Nestor Kirchner. Behind them is the image of former First Lady, Evita Peron. This is just one example of Argentina's mass display of discontent with the way a roughly decade-long lawsuit is shaking out. Eight thousand Argentines flooded the streets on Tuesday, joining their government in protesting Judge Griesa's order that the country pay a group of hedge funds over $1.3 billion worth of sovereign debt. The hedge funds, led by Elliott Management's Paul Singer, bought this debt for pennies after Argentina's last default in 2001. Since then they've insisted on claiming 100 cents on the dollar for their investment, while over 90% of investors have accepted haircuts of up to 70%. To get their money, Singer and his fellow holdout creditors took Argentina to Court and won. So on July 30th, Argentina was supposed to pay the holdouts, as well as the other investors who took haircuts. Argentina did not. The country was declared in default. Since then, Argentina has told anyone and everyone that it is not, in fact, in default. The Republic's politicians insist that because the country sent money to all the other bondholders aside from the holdouts — money that still sits in the country's custodial bank, Bank of New York Mellon— they have fulfilled their obligations. Argentina even took out full page ads in the New York Times and other publications explaining this position. For that, Judge Griesa threatened to issue an order saying the country was in contempt of the Court on Friday. But Argentina did not care. “The proper conditions do not exist to negotiate,” Capitanich told reporters in Buenos Aires on Wednesday. “His lack of decision clearly comes from not understanding the process, not understanding Argentina’s status as a sovereign country."' The process, however, is not Argentina's to decide either. That power is in the hands of the ISDA — the International Swaps Derivatives Association. The ISDA also took some time deliberating whether or not Argentina was in default after June 30th, but on Wednesday it decided to support that declaration. ISDA is now calling for an auction of Argentine credit default swaps on August 21st. Meanwhile, Singer and the holdouts are still going after Argentina's money wherever it may be around the world. Their most recent attempt to uncover some cash has resulted in a small victory. A Nevada Judge has granted the holdouts discovery into 123 shell companies held by an Argentine business man by the name of Lazaro Baez. Baez is accused of launder $71 million for the Argentine government. “If Baez is convicted of embezzlement, any funds traceable to the embezzlement scheme would be property of Argentina available to satisfy NML’s judgements against Argentina,” the hedge fund said in its April 1 request. That's not the whole billion, but it's something — and it will certainly cause some headaches in Buenos Aires. FREE AppDownload
Adam Berry/Getty ImagesRetail sales went nowhere in July. The latest release from the Census Bureau showed that in July retail sales were flat. Expectations were for sales to increase 0.2%. Ian Shepherdson at Pantheon Macroeconomics said the report was "a bit disappointing." Shepherdson noted that, "Decent gains in clothing, miscellaneous and healthcare were offset by a hefty 0.5% drop in general merchandise and 0.1% dips in furniture, electronics and non-store." Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi, who has been a major bull on the economy in the last few months, said of the report: "Net net, it was one of the wettest June’s in years, but retail sales somehow slowed further in July from 0.2% in June and 0.4% in May." Paul Dales, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics, said that the weakness in the July retail report is, "at odds with the recent acceleration in income growth, rises in household wealth and greater availability of credit, which all suggest that the outlook for consumption is improving." Earlier this year, retail spending rallied after a historically brutal winter, but over the balance of this year retail spending has looked much like it has since the financial crisis. Which is to say, kind of meh. FRED Second quarter earnings season, which is coming to an end, also saw a number of less than encouraging reports come from retailers, both on the high- and low-end of the consumer segment. According to data from FactSet, of 176 retailers tracked by the firm during second quarter earnings, 49.4% of companies have reported same-store sales above expectations, while 46.8% of companies came in below estimates. FactSet also said that recent guidance for same-store sales for the rest of this year has deteriorated "significantly" over the past two months, with just 12.7% of companies issuing positive guidance while 21.4% have given negative outlooks. In early July, companies including Bob Evans, The Container Store, and Family Dollar — which are highly dependent on consumer spending — each reported less than stellar earnings. Howard Levine, CEO of discount retailer Family Dollar, said at the time, "Our results continue to reflect the economic challenges facing our core customer and an intense competitive environment." But on the other end of the consumer spectrum, a number of companies have also reported earnings that haven't impressed investors. Designer accessories maker Kate Spade shares fell more than 25% on Tuesday after the company's outlook disappointed. Macy's shares were down more than 5% on Wednesday after the company's earnings missed expectations and Michael Kors shares fell nearly 6% in early August after its earnings report And on Thursday morning, we get earnings from the biggest consumer bellwether in the market: Walmart. But the outlook for this report isn't great. According to data from Bloomberg, adjusted earnings per share are expected to fall 3% from last year. Revenue is expected to grow 1.7% over last year, though the retailer has missed expectations in each of the last 8 quarters. In the middle of second quarter earnings season, we got the first estimate on second quarter GDP, which showed the economy grew at a 4% annualized pace during the quarter. This was up from a revised 2.1% annualized decline in the first quarter. BI's Rob Wile noted, however, that 1.66% of this growth was due to a rise in business inventories, which can potentially signal future cutbacks in production.  But like retail sales, taken as a whole since the financial crisis, GDP growth has also been inconsistent at best. FRED Dales still sees GDP expanding at a 3% annualized rate in the second half of the year, but said Wednesday's retail sales made "clear that spending started the third quarter slowly." There are a number of economic factors that you can point to in efforts to explain the so-so retail spending. But when companies targeting customers at a variety of parts of the economic spectrum, looking at wage growth is particularly instructive. Wages also haven't really done anything since the financial crisis, just barely keeping pace with inflation over that period. FRED Through this period, however, the S&amp;P 500 has moved higher, recently making all-time highs. And until it seems like the economy is growing consistently and meaningfully, optimism surrounding the economy — and the companies most highly exposed to consumers — will remain, well, kind of meh.

PayPal "PayPal Credit," the new name of PayPal's "Bill Me Later," is exactly what it sounds like: It's a credit line that you can access through PayPal. When you apply for PayPal Credit, you provide your date of birth and the last four digits of your Social Security number, and their partner Comenity Capital Bank will let you know if you're approved "in seconds," according to their FAQs. If you're approved, you can access at least $250 worth of credit, and in some cases you might get a small bonus, such as $10 back. Available anywhere that accepts PayPal, "as well as thousands of other online stores," PayPal Credit lets you hold off paying for purchases for up to six months without any interest. No doubt, this will interest some people, but there are a few reasons why you should hesitate to sign up. • This is a line of credit. As such, setting it up will make a hard inquiry on your credit report, which may temporarily lower your credit score by a few points. • Like any credit card, PayPal Credit will charge you for late payments. In this case, it's a fee, plus a relatively high 19.99% APR. • Currently, a customer service rep explained on the phone, PayPal doesn't report your credit activity to the credit bureaus after the initial inquiry to set you up, which means your activity on this line of credit doesn't affect your credit score. Delinquencies don't damage it, but good behavior doesn't improve it. Take that as you will. • After your initial $10 (if you get that offer), there aren't any major bonuses like a cash-back or miles card might provide. The chief reward for this line of credit is that you get extra time to pay your balance, and for many consumers, that isn't very impressive. In short, PayPal Credit is fairly innocuous, but also pretty unnecessary. The best thing you get out of the line of credit is increased time to pay for larger purchases, but if you can't pay for discretionary items in cash today, you probably shouldn't be buying them. Signing up also may lead consumers to buy more: TechCrunch reported that PayPal users spend 30% more after signing up for credit. That's not exactly a good thing. If you have the money and just don't feel like handing it over, the waiting period still introduces an element of human error — that is, the chance for you to forget to pay your bill. Even if you decide you really need to buy said product right now (or you've calculated it out and decided that the money you aren't using to pay this individual bill will get greater returns if it's invested over the relatively short span of six months), the only reason you'd do it with a credit line that doesn't affect your credit score is if you're trying to disguise bad credit behavior, i.e. expecting to be unable to pay. And if you're unable to pay when the bill comes through, like with any credit card, it's going to charge you a fortune. PayPal in its original form is already pretty convenient — so why wouldn't you just stick with that? FREE AppDownload
ChipotleFor the past decade, Chipotle's growth has been unstoppable.  The burrito chain has a market value of $19 billion, and more than 1,600 locations. The stock price has increased nearly 70% in the past year.  But Ken Kurson at Esquire makes a compelling case for why Chipotle's growth is unsustainable.  "Next time you're in a Chipotle, look past the attractive design and friendly employees," Kurson writes. "Would you buy that location (which almost certainly doesn't even own its real estate) for $12 million?" Here are a few reasons he says the growth could stop.  1. Food and labor costs are rising. Earlier this year, Chipotle raised prices, citing commodity costs. Two key ingredients, beef and avocados, have proved especially costly. At the same time, the jobs market is recovering and fast food workers are striking for better benefits and pay. If business costs continue to rise, Chipotle's profits will suffer.  2. The reason for Chipotle's success is "fragile." Chipotle's success is largely dependent on its "food with integrity" values, according to Kurson. So far, customers have been willing to shell out more for burritos that are higher-quality than many fast food competitors. But as Chipotle expands, it runs the risk that new customers won't be as perceptive. "Will customers at airports and military bases and mall food courts—all cited as growth areas by the company—care as much about food with integrity?" Kurson asks.  3. The company risks saturation. Chipotle has 1,600 locations, with plans for more expansion. Kurson argues that in order to live up to its high share value, the company would have to open considerably more locations. This could result in cannibalization — visitors stop frequenting one Chipotle in order to go to a closer one. The company could also have trouble finding customers  willing to shell out for its burritos.  Kurson reassures readers not to think that Chipotle is in trouble or going out of business.  "Bottom line: This is a great company with great food and a bright future," he writes. "But the stock is way ahead of itself." FREE AppDownload
Giles Clarke/Getty ReportageThe bloodiest conflicts in Europe since WWII, the Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s had a devastating effect that some areas still haven't recovered from. The city of Mostar, which now lies in the southern part of Bosnia and Herzegovina, still shows signs of war, both physically and psychologically. Bullet-riddled and half-leveled buildings remain untouched and un-repaired, standing as de facto monuments to the lives lost in the region's ethnic clashes. Official monuments to the war have been destroyed, pointing to lingering tensions. Mostar is rich in history. When Bosnia was part of the Ottoman Empire, the city was a crucial stopping point on trade routes to the Adriatic Sea. A centuries-old arched bridge over the Neretva River, known as the Stari Most, was a renowned landmark and became a symbol for the town and the Empire. In 1992, whenYugoslavia was crumbling and multi-ethnic Bosnia and Herzegovina declared independence from an increasingly nationalist, Serb-led Yugoslav government in Belgrade. Bosnian and Croat Mostar soon fell under a lengthy siege from Serb forces. For 18 months, heavily-armed Serb paramilitaries fought combined Bosnian and Croatian forces along a front-line running through the center of town. Later, the Bosnian and Croatian armies began fighting against each other, pushing Bosnian Muslims out of the Western part of the city and causing further destruction and casualties. Many historical structures were razed during the conflict, including the Stari Most, which collapsed under Croat shelling in November of 1993.  Photojournalist and human rights activist Giles Clarke recently visited Mostar to document the current state of the city. Clarke's guide, a former soldier for the Bosnian army, still lives in Mostar. He joined the Bosnian army after it's break with the Croats in 1993. The guide, who asked not to be named, was shot and injured twice during the conflict. "There were 2000 grenades falling a day. Mostar was left in dust and flames," he told Clarke. Unrest still brews in Mostar, despite nearly 20 years of peace. Earlier this year, political gridlock and a down economy sparked protests and riots in Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as in Mostar. More recently, elections in Mostar were postponed, due to conflicts between Bosniak and Croat parties.  "It's still divided," Clarke's guide says. "The government is still the same people from 20 years before."  
Thomson ReutersA trader looks at his screen as he works on the floor of the New York Stock ExchangeWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Companies even partly owned by individuals sanctioned by the U.S. government could find themselves blacklisted as the result of a rule change announced on Wednesday by the Treasury Department. Treasury, which is responsible for applying and enforcing U.S. sanctions, has had the power to blacklist any company in which a U.S.-sanctioned individual owned at least a 50 percent stake. Under the new rule, companies could see their assets frozen and be prevented from doing business in the United States if the aggregate ownership stakes of all individuals sanctioned by the U.S. government reached the 50 percent threshold. Douglas Jacobson, a lawyer in Washington who specializes in trade and sanctions, said the amendment "represents a significant change" that would force firms to re-evaluate which entities could be blocked under U.S. law. Any company owned by at least two of the three U.S.-sanctioned Russian billionaires, Gennady Timchenko and Boris and Arkady Rotenberg, for example, could be blacklisted even if each stakeholder only had a 25 percent interest. The United States added the three men, who are close to Russian President Vladimir Putin, to its sanctions list in March after Russia rushed to consolidate its annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region. U.S. sanctions were expanded to include Russian banks and energy and defense companies in recent months, as part of an effort to punish Russia for what the United States and other Western nations view as its role in fueling a separatist rebellion in eastern Ukraine.

Thomson ReutersFile of a view from the boardwalk of several casinos in Atlantic City, New JerseyBy Daniel Kelley (Reuters) - Atlantic City's supporters have launched an ad campaign to reverse what they see as an onslaught of bad publicity about the New Jersey seaside resort, where four of 12 casinos have recently announced plans to close. Full-page ads to appear on Thursday in the Philadelphia Inquirer, Newark Star-Ledger and Wall Street Journal show the city's beach earlier this month during a free concert by country stars Lady Antebellum attended by 65,000 people. Atlantic City Alliance, the marketing agency behind the city's "Do AC" slogan, bought the ads, which will run two days after the city's newest casino, the $2.4 billion Revel, said it would shut down after less than three years in business. "The image is that this city is dead," said Liza Cartmell, the president of the Atlantic City Alliance. "In reality, our boardwalk is packed, our beaches are packed. We have a lot of reporters coming down to do stories on these closures, and they say, 'Why can't I get a room?'" Room occupancy rates in Atlantic City have topped 95 percent, the alliance says, while some hotels that are not associated with casinos are experiencing double-digit growth. Cartmell hopes the ads will highlight non-gaming activities as Atlantic City tries to reposition itself as a family-friendly leisure and entertainment destination. Gaming revenue for Atlantic City, which once held a lucrative East Coast gambling monopoly, has dropped from its 2006 peak of $5.2 billion to $2.8 billion, according to state gaming regulators. The trend follows the introduction or expansion of gaming in neighboring states, including Pennsylvania, Maryland and New York. The Revel's closing could leave Atlantic City with a third fewer casinos than at the start of the year, when 12 were in operation. In July, Trump Plaza Hotel said it would close in September. The Atlantic Club casino was sold and shut down in January and the Showboat Atlantic City, one of the city's largest properties, has said it will close at the end of August. The alliance wanted the ads to run in the Philadelphia and northern New Jersey newspapers to reach the resort's traditional consumers. The ad in the Wall Street Journal, which is identical to the one in the other papers, was meant to reach the investment and financial community, Cartmell said.

AP PhotoFormer governor of Pernambuco state and Brazilian Socialist Party (PSB) presidential candidate Eduardo CamposSocialist Brazilian Presidential candidate Eduardo Campos died in a tragic plane crash on Wednesday, potentially changing the outcome of an election that Wall Street has been watching very closely. What the Street is watching for is another shift in the dramatic story of Brazil's growth. Once thought to be on the path to massive economic wealth, Brazil's economy has slowed down while its inflation rate has sped up. Protests before the World Cup showed that Brazilians were unhappy with their standard of living and President Dilma Rousseff's regime. It seemed like change was afoot — and prominent investors, like Mike Novogratz of Fortress Investment Group, have been betting that regime change will mean good things for the economy. In Nomura's opinion, that change could still come if Marina Silva, Campos' running mate, decides to run in his place. Campos was third in the field, which included Rousseff (in first) and economist former Brazilian governor Aécio Neves. Nomura analyst Tony Volpon is not, however, sure that Silva can be a lasting candidate if she remains in the race, as she trails her competitors in terms of resources. What we can say is that Marina<U+201F>s entry into the race raises the chances of the election going to a second round, a negative for President Rousseff. Marina appeals to younger, urban voters, many of whom are undecided. Many analysts have pointed to the need to get these voters to the polls to get the election in a second round, and we believe this will now happen. It also bears nothing that in 2010 exit polls showed that 50% of her votes went to opposition candidate Serra of the PSDB and 29% to then candidate Dilma Rousseff. The bank maintains its view that in a three-party election, it will go down to Rousseff and Neves, and that Neves will emerge victorious. But, naturally, there are other ways to see this. The Economist Intelligence Unit's Brazil analyst, Robert Wood, also thinks that Silva's introduction to the race would make a second round runoff more likely, which is bad for Rousseff. However, if Silva decides not to run, her party will be without a candidate with her level of national star power. In that case, Rousseff could very well remain in office. We'll be watching closely.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermidHigh-yield bonds’ attractive income has made them popular in today’s low-rate environment. But market complacency has caused callable-bond investors to ignore a lurking risk: duration extension in a rising-rate scenario. The vast majority of high-yield (also known as noninvestment-grade) bonds are callable. At any point after a predetermined number of years following a bond’s issuance, the issuer can “call” it—meaning take the bond back from the investor before it matures. For example, a bond with a 10-year maturity is typically callable five years after issuance. The “no call” period before the call date provides investors some protection by preventing an early call. And when issuers do call a bond, they typically pay investors a premium above the face value, which provides further insulation. But investors often overlook an important risk: the chance that a bond won’t be called, especially when interest rates rise. Issuers Hold the Upper Hand Historically, high-yield callable bonds’ yield advantage over government bonds provided a cushion against rising rates. But with this yield advantage diminished today, that cushion is not as large. At the same time, rising interest rates often dictate the decision an issuer makes with its callable bonds (Display). AllianceBernsteinIf rates and yields rise enough, issuers will likely choose to not call their bonds until a later call date or simply wait until the maturity date to refinance. Investors could be left holding on to bonds they didn’t plan to own so long—bonds now trading at lower prices due to rising yields. And if the bond isn’t called, investors can’t reinvest the proceeds in newer bonds with higher yields. This is known as extension risk. Of course, if interest rates are lower, issuers have an incentive to call bonds and issue new ones that pay lower coupon income. This cuts issuers’ interest expenses but lowers the returns for investors. There’s a good chance that a bond will be called if it’s trading at a price higher than its call price (for example, a bond callable at $103 but trading at $105). Sometimes issuers will call a bond even if rates aren’t lower, to maintain financial flexibility. They can refinance when there’s demand from investors, and they don’t have to risk waiting until the maturity date, when market sentiment may be much worse. Issuers will only postpone a call and let the bonds extend if rates rise enough to overcome their need for flexibility in financing. Unfortunately, it seems the market isn’t properly pricing extension scenarios into callable bonds. Because we’ve seen a long string of interest-rate declines since the high-yield market was developed, we haven’t experienced prolonged rising-rate scenarios. The result is complacency about extension risk. Managing Extension Risk We think that investors should focus on high-yield strategies that work to minimize extension risk. This can be accomplished through the use of derivatives such as credit default swaps (which aren’t callable) or by carefully studying bond prices, call features and maturity dates—and knowing when to avoid bonds that don’t provide enough risk compensation. High yield may still be the best answer to today’s low-yield environment, but fully understanding extension risk and how it factors into callable bonds can reduce the chances of an unpleasant surprise for investors if rates rise.

REUTERS/Jason ReedU.S. Secretary of State John Kerry speaks with five-year-old Dara Edwards, the daughter of an American staffer at the U.S. Consulate in Sydney, as he meets embassy and consular staff in Sydney.Stocks surged despite some disappointing economic data, both from the U.S. and overseas. First, the scoreboard: And now, the top stories on Wednesday: 1. Retail sales for July were flat compared to June, the worst reading in six months. Economists were expecting retail sales to climb 0.2%. Excluding autos and gas, retail sales were up 0.1%, missing expectations for a 0.4% gain. "Clothing increased 0.4% primarily on the extreme discounting at related stores as many retailers rid the shelves of summer apparel, making way for the back-to-school season — the second largest season after Christmas holiday spending," said Bloomberg economists Richard Yamarone and Josh Wright. Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics said the report was "A bit disappointing but the trend is OK and August should be better."  2. Overnight, Japan reported second quarter GDP that fell 6.8% on an annualized basis. The drop was expected, as Japan enacted a new consumption tax in April, but is still a severe decline for the world's third-largest economy, which grew 6.1% annualized in the first quarter. 3. In addition to the poor retail sales report, retail giant Macy's reported earnings and revenue that disappointed, and shares of the company fell more than 5%. Macy's reported earnings per share of $0.80, missing the $0.86 that was expected by analysts on revenue of $6.27 billion, which also missed the $6.3 billion Wall Street was looking for. Macy's said it failed to make up for its poor sales performance in the first quarter, and now sees full-year sales up 1.5%-2%. 4. SeaWorld shares got absolutely crushed, falling more than 32% after the theme-park operator reported disappointed earnings and revenue. Attendance at the company's park also continues to lag in the wake of CNN's controversial documentary "Blackfish," which brought to light questions regarding the treatment of Orca whales. In the second quarter, SeaWorld's attendance was up 0.3% from the prior year, but this compared to year-ago attendance that fell 9%. Year-to-date, attendance at SeaWorld parks is down 4.3%. 5. Brazilian presidential candidate Eduardo Campos was killed in a plane crash on Wednesday as it was preparing to land in bad weather. Following the report, Brazil's Ibovespa stock index fell as much as 2%, but eventually pared most of these losses. Campos was currently third in the polls, and Tony Volpon at Nomura said these developments don't change his view of the election, which he expects to be won by Aécio Neves. 6. Deere &amp; Co. shares fell more than 2% after the agribusiness giant said it expects revenue to fall 6% compared to last year. The company also gave an update on its view of the global agriculture market and the global economy. 7. Shares of King Digital fell more than 23% after the maker of the popular Candy Crush mobile game last night reported revenues that disappointed. The company also announced a surprising $150 million special dividend and said its revenue for the full-year would be below current expectations.

Daniel Berehulak/Getty ImagesCisco CEO John Chambers.Cisco just reported its earnings for last quarter. It's a beat on revenue and EPS, but the stock is basically flat after hours. Here's the score: EPS: $0.55 vs. $0.53 expected. Revenue: $12.4 billion vs. $12.14 billion expected. The big news: Cisco announced a new round of job cuts. It will cut 6,000 jobs, or 8% of its workforce, starting next quarter. Another troubling sign: Sales are way down in emerging markets. China is getting hit very hard. Sales are down 23% there. Last quarter marked the end of Cisco's fiscal year 2014. Guidance for the next year doesn't look good, basically flat to 1% growth. Here's the breakdown of everything for last quarter and the full fiscal year: Cisco FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersThe Boeing logo is seen at their headquarters in ChicagoBy Alwyn Scott EVERETT Wa. (Reuters) - - Boeing  executives and state political leaders took sledgehammers to a 1960s office block on Wednesday to help clear the way for a factory that will make composite wings for the company's newest jet, the 777X. The 1.3-million-square-foot composite wing center at the site of Boeing's massive aircraft assembly operation should cement the company's growth in Washington state for decades to come, and reflects Boeing's desire to bring more of its operations under its own roof.  The previous generation of composite wings, used on Boeing's 787 Dreamliner, are made by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd  in Nagoya, Japan. "We're going to be a here for a long, long time," Boeing Commercial Airplanes Chief Executive Ray Conner told a crowd of about 100 that included Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Governor Jay Inslee, senior Boeing executives, employees and officials from the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, District 751. The decision to build the wing in the U.S. marks a major shift in Boeing's strategy after it outsourced wings and other major pieces of its carbon-composite 787 to suppliers around the world, a process that led to production problems and made the aircraft three years late in reaching customers. Boeing's decision should also ensure decades of stability and growth for hundreds of suppliers located near the factory and across the state, who will provide crucial 777X components. "We're bringing this wing home from where it is built for the 787. It is a hometown wing," Gov. Inslee said. The new wing factory will house three of the world's largest autoclaves used for curing composite material. Each autoclave is large enough to hold two 737 fuselages, Boeing said. The building will be occupied starting in 2016. The first 777X is due to be delivered in 2020. The new jet, which carries a list price of up to $389 million and has garnered 286 orders, is expected to be 12 percent more fuel efficient than the current 777, which was introduced in 1995 and has become one of Boeing's most popular and reliable wide-body planes. Conner thanked the machinists' union for approving an eight-year extension to their labor contract earlier this year. The agreement essentially traded union members' defined-benefit pension plan for the guarantee of future work on the 777X. Boeing said the extension was necessary to ensure the wing factory and the 777X assembly plant would be placed in Washington, and not in another state. But the vote bitterly divided union members. IAM District 751 Local C President Ron Coen, who was among the dignitaries taking a swing at the wall, told the crowd he didn't agree with the vote. "But that's the past," he said. "We're here today about the future, about promises made and kept by the Boeing Company."  (Reporting by Alwyn Scott; Editing by Chris Reese) FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Max RossiRetail sales jobs are disappearing, according to Wells Fargo analysts.  "While we do not expect to see 'the death of the salesman,' there are clear signs that these positions are becoming much scarcer," analysts wrote in a recent note.  Department stores, where 58% of the employees work in sales, are struggling. They cut their workforce by 300,000 positions between 2002 and 2013, according to the note. 63% of the fired employees were in sales.  Meanwhile, employment within the "electronic shopping sector," which includes online retailers, rose more than 30% over the same time period. With the rise of e-commerce, demand will grow for a new kind of retail worker. "The increasing importance of e-commerce implies that a much different skill set will be required for the retail employees of tomorrow," analysts wrote. "Positions such as data analysis and consumer insight specialists that study e-commerce transactions across product types will continue to become more commonplace." These new positions will require a "higher degree of training and technical competency than in the past, which will also contribute to the changing face of retail."

Mark/flickrHigher driving costs and falling pay have created a truck-driver shortage that's likely to worsen in the coming years. The American Trucking Associations (ATA) estimates the U.S. is short 30,000 truck drivers — a number expected to surge to 239,000 by 2022. In July 2013, new federal hours-of-service rules went into effect.  The key provision was a limit to the use of a 34-hour "restart." Drivers have a 70-hour-a-week cap on how much time they can be on the road. Previously, they'd been able to artificially reset that cap to zero if they took 34 consecutive hours off. Now, many are unable to do so. As a result, according to a survey from the American Transportation Research Institute, more than 80% of motor carriers have experienced a productivity loss, with nearly half saying they require more drivers to haul the same amount of freight. "Smaller 'owner/operator' firms are increasingly dropping by the wayside as the cost of operations and maintenance are simply becoming too expensive to stay in business," Paul Pittman, a planner at a North Carolina-based logisitcs company, told Business Insider by email.  So drivers are suddenly faced with the choice of leaving the profession entirely or moving to a larger company where wages are likely to be lower.  "As controls continue to tighten, many of the existing drivers currently employed are turning to other areas of employment simply to get off the road and escape some of the regulations implemented to govern their operations," Pittman said. To hang on, small operators are forced to cut corners. For Jeff, a driver who asked to be identified by only his first name, the pay isn't the biggest issue — it's the compromises some firms are making on driver compliance. "With how my lifestyle is [the pay is] pretty decent. I don’t go out and blow money on speed boats, or the best electronics, or hookers and blow," Jeff said. "I’m married and I have four children. We prioritize our finances. Two years ago we finally bought an HDTV. My main issue is the safety aspect." His primary issue with trucking companies is the pressure they put on drivers to violate federal rules. Jeff worked for a small outfit in the Midwest. The owner of that company, he says, wanted him to take a dry van load from Hubbard, Ohio, to Syracuse, New York, which is about 327 miles. Jeff explained that this trip takes longer for trucks than it does for cars, because trucks carry heavier loads, and it takes longer for them to speed up and slow down. It would take a truck about five hours and 15 minutes from Hubbard to Syracuse.  The owner, whom Jeff didn't want named, asked him to drive back to Hubbard empty, do a drop-and-hook (drop one trailer, hook another) and take another trailer up to Binghamton, New York, the same day. And the trip from Hubbard to Binghamton is about five and a half hours, meaning a round trip would only leave him about 30 minutes of driving for the day and legally Jeff couldn't. Google Maps "When you're non-compliant as a driver you run the risk of fatigue and the risk of hurting other people," he said. "And as a driver it's my license on the line." Jeff said he was asked by multiple trucking companies to falsify his logs, but he refused to. "I consider myself a safety-oriented driver, and I have found that is a bad thing," Jeff said. "Because since I got my CDL [commercial driver's license] in 2008, I have worked for about 10 different trucking companies. That doesn't look good because it looks like it is job hopping ... I'm sticking to my guns." Another problem is lack of time spent at home. Todd Feucht of Wisconsin says drivers can expect to spend as little as 52 days at home a year. Feucht, who hauls oversize loads, averages about three to five weeks. Last year he was home 54 days, including his vacation days. "Back in the day you were treated like a knight, but now you're treated like a peon," Feucht says. All of this helps explain why the turnover rate at large truckload carriers was 92% annualized in Q1, according to the ATA. Turnover refers to the rate at which drivers leave the industry and are replaced. "One-hundred percent turnover doesn’t mean that every driver left," ATA chief economist Bob Costello says. "If you keep a driver for 90 days, the rate generally drops in half. However, there are a group of drivers that churn, and they generally stay at a carrier for a short length of time (just weeks or a couple of months). Many drivers stay with a carrier for years." Meanwhile, drivers with less experience or bargaining power get squeezed. Feucht has been driving trucks for 20 years and thinks trucking companies need to be more honest when recruiting. The new drivers are "greener than grass," he said. Those who attempt to lease trucks quickly discover the significant cost of maintenance and overhead. Young drivers who go this route end up having very little to show for it.  "I meet these guys at truck-stops and they can barely afford to eat ramen during the week," Feucht told Business Insider. "They're dropping $850 on a truck a week." Truck drivers typically get paid hourly or by the mile. Some get a percentage of the load. If you're getting less than 33 cents a mile "you're getting ripped off," Jeff, a 36-year old truck driver from Ohio, told Business Insider. The truck drivers suggest if these companies want to see this turnover decrease they need to focus on improving pay, improving training for new entrants, and they need to not push them to violate federal regulations. There may finally be some movement on this front. Last month, Swift, one of the largest haulers in the U.S., announced it would refocus expenditures on better labor conditions for employees, including higher wages. "After assessing the current and expected environment, we believe the best investment we can make at this time, for all of our stakeholders, is in our drivers," the firm said in its earnings release. "Our goal is to clear the path for our drivers by helping them overcome challenges, eliminate wait times and take home more money." ATA FREE AppDownload
Wikimedia CommonsWe have written a few times on The Blog about the ongoing effects of the low Fed Funds rate and quantitative easing. They have pushed interest rates down across markets, propelling investors into asset classes such as corporate bonds and emerging market debt in search of yield. One area where we have seen a lot of inflows is high yield bonds, as this sector has offered yields above 5%. Investors have been less concerned about default risk as global defaults fell below 2% and volatility in both stocks and bonds remained low, making high yield investments all the more appealing. In the past few weeks we have seen some cracks in the high yield picture. Elevated geopolitical risk, an Argentina default and a US jobs report that was weak relative to expectations contributed to the sell-off. The iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (HYG), which had been trading above $93.50 since February, fell to $92.04 on August 1st before rallying in recent days. From June 30th to August 6th, high yield bond ETFs experienced $3.7 billion of redemptions, and this included shorter maturity high yield funds which had been impervious to previous periods of outflows. Overall, since June 30th, the high yield bond market has lost about 2%. This decline in prices has pushed credit spreads (the additional yield over US Treasuries) on high yield bonds out by 0.67%, and now spreads have reached more than 4% above US Treasuries for the first time since February this year. Will this bring investors back into the market? It is difficult to say, as the environment for credit risky securities seems to be more favorable than the recent sell-off implies. As high yield spreads have widened, they have become more attractive to other fixed income investments. The ratio of high yield to investment grade credit spreads, for example, is now more than 4:1, a level we haven’t seen since October 2012 when the unemployment rate was 7.9%. As the chart below illustrates, this ratio has tended to decline when the 4% level has been breached. Of course the ratio could fall from either a tightening (improvement) of high yield spreads or a widening (worsening) of investment grade spreads. This is the key question, where the recent sell-off was isolated to the high yield market or whether it will spread to investment grade as well. BlackRockBloomberg, Barclays and BlackRock as of 8/7/2014So what does this mean for investors? We have been neutral on high yield for the past few months as it has offered more income potential than other asset classes. High yield remains a potential source of income in a diversified portfolio, but potential price appreciation is limited. The recent sell-off is also a good reminder to investors of the potential volatility of the asset class. Given current yields, investors have to weigh whether they are being paid enough to take on this volatility and the underlying credit risk. Another consideration is whether recent price movements represent a temporary setback for the high yield market or the beginning of a broader re-pricing of corporate bonds. Given overall economic conditions I doubt that there will be any contagion into investment grade debt. For now, I continue to be neutral on high yield. FREE AppDownload

Dr. Ed's BlogAging Baby Boomers may be keeping a lid on wage inflation. They are currently 50-66 years old. Since the previous peak in employment during November 2007, employment has been little changed, yet workers who are 55 years old or older grabbed 5.6 million of the jobs. That means that all the younger workers lost about as many jobs. Of course, what really happened is that simply by keeping their jobs during the Great Recession, Baby Boomers “aged out” of the stats for the younger workers and bloated the stats for the older ones. In any case, they’ve probably done well enough so that they aren’t likely to be pushing for significant wage gains. Meanwhile, the younger workers may not be in a position to push for better pay either since they are competing with Baby Boomers who are likely to remain on the job well past the traditional retirement age of 65. This creates a new source of labor, i.e., elderly workers, which may keep a lid on wage inflation. We can already see this tendency in the number of workers who are 65 or older. Since November 2007, this segment of the working-age population has increased by 8.5 million. The number of these folks who have dropped out of the labor force (mostly to retire) has increased 6.3 million over this period. The number who remained in the labor force rose 2.2 million. There are lots more older workers coming as the Baby Boomers age. Dr. Ed's BlogToday's Morning Briefing: Another Good JOLTS. (1) Fed Chair is no slacker, but worries a lot about slack.

 The shroud of mystery has been (slightly) lifted from the so-called King of Beer. Daily Beast reporter Tim Mak wrote a fascinating article about Kent "Battle" Martin, whose work you see every day but whom few know anything about. Martin is known for approving practically every beer bottle and label on the market for the Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB). He is also known for being highly enigmatic. He's so secretive, in fact, that the publication wasn't even able to interview the regulator. Regardless, here are some interesting tidbits about the most powerful man in the brewing world that they were able to dig up:  He goes by the name "Battle." Martin has approved over 29,500 beer labels just this year.  The Tax and Trade Bureau would not even tell The Daily Beast any basic biographical details about Martin. Good luck Googling him. He is described as awkward and robotic. Brewers say they have received approvals and notices coming in the middle of the night. There was even one anecdote of him at a craft brewers' conference working on several laptops at once, simultaneously looking at different labels. Martin once rejected a beer label for the King of Hearts because the image of the heart on the bottle implied that the beer would have health benefits. He also rejected a beer label called St. Paula’s Liquid Wisdom because he thought it made the medical claim of granting wisdom.  He rejected the label of a beer called Bad Elf because it featured an "Elf Warning" that said elves should not drink while making toys. Battle thought the warning was confusing to consumers. Read more about Kent "Battle" Martin over at The Daily Beast.  FREE AppDownload
Magnolia Pictures This report comes about a year CNN's controversial documentary "Blackfish," which brought to light questions regarding the treatment of Orca whales.  SeaWorld reported earnings of $0.43 per share, less than the $0.59 that was expected by analysts.  Second-quarter revenue also missed expectations, coming in at $405.2 million against expectations for $445.3 million.  Attendance at the company's parks increased modestly, rising 0.3% against the prior year to 6.6 million. Attendance in the second quarter last year, however, declined 9%. Year to date, attendance at SeaWorld parks is down 4.3%.  "We were pleased to report attendance growth in the quarter despite a challenging industry and competitive environment and a tough comparison to the prior year quarter," SeaWorld CEO Jim Atchison said. For the full year, SeaWorld expects revenue to decline 6% to 7% over last year, which contrasts sharply with current Wall Street expectations for an increase of 3%. The company also expects adjusted EBITDA, or earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization, to decline 14% to 16% from a year ago.  Atchison added: "In order to drive growth, we are undertaking a number of initiatives, including a detailed review of our Company-wide cost structure with the goal of driving significant cash cost savings in 2014 and 2015. Our intent is to re-invest these savings into additional new attractions at our destination parks and return capital to shareholders." As part of its capital return plans, SeaWorld announced a $250 million share repurchase authorization, which begins Jan. 1.  On Twitter, CNBC's Giovanny Moreano noted that SeaWorld's plunge put the shares at their lowest level on record.   FREE AppDownload
Mohanned Faisal/ReutersA woman carries a bundle of newly harvested wheat stalks in Albu Efan village southwest of Falluja.After seizing five oil fields and Iraq's biggest dam, Sunni militants bent on creating an Islamic empire in the Middle East now control yet another powerful economic weapon – wheat supplies. Fighters from the Islamic State have overrun large areas in five of Iraq's most fertile provinces, where the United Nations food agency says around 40 percent of its wheat is grown. Now they're helping themselves to grain stored in government silos, milling it and distributing the flour on the local market, an Iraqi official told Reuters. The Islamic State has even tried to sell smuggled wheat back to the government to finance a war effort marked by extreme violence and brutality. International officials are drawing uneasy comparisons with the days of hardship under dictator Saddam Hussein, when Western sanctions led to serious shortages in the 1990s. "Now is the worst time for food insecurity since the sanctions and things are getting worse," said Fadel El-Zubi, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) representative for Iraq. While Iraq faces no immediate food shortages, the longer term outlook is deeply uncertain. Hassan Nusayif al-Tamimi, head of an independent nationwide union of farmers' cooperatives, said the militants were intimidating any producers who tried to resist. "They are destroying crops and produce, and this is creating friction with the farmers. They are placing farmers under a lot of pressure so that they can take their grain," he said, adding that farmers had reported fighters were also wrecking wells. Many farmers have joined the hundreds of thousands of Iraqis who have fled the Arab and foreign fighters' advance. Those who remain have yet to be paid for the last crop, meaning they have no money to buy seed, fuel and fertilisers to plant the next. The statistics following the jihadists' lightning advance across northern Iraq in June are grim both for the government in Baghdad and a population that needs reliable food supplies. Iraq's trade ministry says 1.1 million tonnes of wheat it bought from farmers this harvest season is in silos in the five provinces. This represents nearly 20 percent of annual Iraqi consumption which the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) puts at around 6.5 million tonnes, roughly half of which is imported. Amidst the chaos of northern Iraq, it remains unclear exactly how much wheat has fallen into rebel hands, as the government still controls parts of the provinces. However, a source at the Agriculture Ministry confirmed the size of the problem. About 30 percent of Iraq's entire farm production, including the wheat crop, is at risk, the source said, requesting anonymity.  The Islamic State already has extensive business dealings. It is selling crude oil and gasoline both in Iraq andSyria, where it is fighting President Bashar al-Assad's forces to create a cross-border caliphate. So far, it has largely used energy and food resources under its control as a fund raiser rather than an instrument of siege, selling instead of withholding them. A senior Iraqi government official told Reuters that the militants had seized wheat in recent weeks from government silos in the provinces of Nineveh and Anbar, which both border Syria. These included 40,000-50,000 tonnes taken in Tal Afar and another Nineveh town, Sinjar, where tens of thousands of local people from the Yazidi religious minority have fled the militant onslaught to a nearby mountain range. Hassan Ibrahim, Director General of the Grain Board of Iraq, said the Islamic State had tried to sell wheat stolen from Nineveh back to the government via middle men in other provinces. "For this reason I stopped purchasing wheat from farmers last Thursday," said Ibrahim, whose Trade Ministry body is responsible for procuring wheat internationally and from local producers. Bread prices are stable in Baghdad due to imports and crops in areas still under government control. In Baghdadand nine other southern provinces, the Trade Ministry has bought nearly 1.4 million tonnes from farmers this season. It is not clear whether the government's import needs will rise dramatically, given that it will probably not try to supply areas no longer under its control. Mohanned Faisal/ReutersVillagers scatter wheat seeds on a field during planting season in Falluja Iraq's wheat harvest began in May, the month before the Islamists and their allies launched their assault, taking the cities of Mosul and Tikrit in days when resistance from thousands of U.S.-trained government soldiers collapsed. The harvest begins in the south and moves north, meaning that farmers began delivering wheat to government silos in rural areas around Mosul in early June, less than two weeks before militants stormed the city. Zubi said the government usually pays the producers two months in arrears. Therefore an estimated 400,000 farmers are living under the militants with no hope of being paid for the wheat they delivered before the offensive. "No farmer received his money," he said, meaning they will not be able to start planting in the seeding season that begins as soon as next month in some areas. "This is their sole income." The FAO is urgently working to get 3,000 tonnes of wheat seed to the farmers for planting, he said, though this effort faces major problems due to the security situation. Seed deliveries are vital for ensuring that fellow U.N. agencies such as the World Food Programme, which are already helping hundreds of thousands, are not saddled with feeding yet more Iraqis. John Schnittker, a former USDA economist who advised the Trade Ministry for three years before USDA pulled its staff out of Baghdad in 2012, said a number of factors would "severely test" the ability of farmers in northern Iraqto grow their wheat crops to be harvested next year. These included threats to irrigation water due to the militants' control of the Mosul dam, the government's inability to get fertilizer and fuel to farmers in areas under the Islamic State, and the fact that many producers fled their homes. He expected a "lower planted area and lower yields" for the 2014/15 harvest. "It's very likely to be disrupted because of the conflict." Meanwhile, the "public distribution system" - the government's means of supplying subsidized flour and other goods such as vegetable oil, sugar and rice - has broken down in militant-held areas. Although the system is corrupt and wasteful, impoverished Iraqis depend on it. Schnittker said its breakdown poses a "huge hardship" to northern Iraq's rural population and would eventually push more people into refugee status.   (Maggie Fick reported from Baghdad and Cairo; Additional reporting by Sarah McFarlane and Jonathan Saul in London; Editing by Michael Georgy and David Stamp) FREE AppDownload

REUTERS/Eliana Aponte/Files ">Thomson ReutersFile of Israeli Prime Minister Sharon shaking hands with Ezra Merkin during ceremony in JerusalemBy Jonathan Stempel NEW YORK (Reuters) - The trustee seeking money for Bernard Madoff's victims suffered his second loss in less than a week to Wall Street hedge fund manager J. Ezra Merkin, as a Manhattan bankruptcy judge dismissed most claims in a roughly $565 million lawsuit. Judge Stuart Bernstein said the trustee Irving Picard failed to show that Merkin knew Madoff was running a giant Ponzi scheme while his "feeder funds" were sending money to the swindler's firm, Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC. Picard's allegations "do not imply the level of certainty or absence of substantial doubt associated with actual knowledge," the judge wrote in a 66-page decision on Tuesday. Bernstein dismissed claims alleging various fraudulent transfers among Merkin's funds, and said Picard cannot block the funds from trying to recoup money from the Madoff firm's estate. He let Picard pursue a claim over roughly $315 million transferred to Merkin's funds from Madoff's firm in the two years prior to the firm's bankruptcy, on the ground that Merkin willfully blinded himself to the fraud and ignored red flags. Picard may also pursue a claim that Merkin's funds should recover nothing from the estate until other customers and creditors get paid. Andrew Levander, a lawyer for Merkin and his firm Gabriel Capital Corp, said he was pleased at the dismissal of the "vast majority of the trustee's baseless claims as a matter of law," and that the remaining claims are "factually without merit." Amanda Remus, a spokeswoman for Picard, said the trustee is reviewing the decision and "prepared to move forward to trial" on the remaining claims.  JOKES, NOT ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Bernstein ruled four days after a federal appeals court in New York rejected Picard's effort to void Merkin's $410 million settlement with New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman to repay investors in the Gabriel Capital LP, Ariel Fund Ltd, Ascot Fund Ltd and Ascot Partners LP feeder funds. Picard contended that the accord interfered with his ability to recoup money from Merkin to pay Madoff's own customers. The trustee's case included comments Merkin allegedly made after fraud was uncovered in 2005 at Bayou Group LLC, whose principal Samuel Israel is serving a 22-year prison term. Picard claimed Merkin mused to an investment adviser about renaming the "Ponzi scheme" the "Madoff scheme," and told Madoff himself that "as soon as there is a scam in the hedge fund industry, someone is going to call about Bernie." Bernstein, however, said such quips "seem more like jokes than acknowledgments" about Madoff's activities. But in allowing the willful blindness claim, the judge said Picard plausibly alleged that Merkin's "finer faculties were overcome by the fees" he earned by dealing with Madoff. Picard has recovered $9.83 billion for Madoff customers who lost roughly $17.5 billion of principal. Madoff, 76, is serving a 150-year prison term. The case is Picard v. Merkin et al, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York, No. 09-ap-01182.  (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Tom Brown) FREE AppDownload

The police told Reuters that there were fatalities but did not say how many. Bloomberg reports that Brazilian Socialist Party presidential candidate Eduardo Campos died and that his aides say they lost contact with his plane. Seven people were on the plane, the Associated Press reports. Local media had reported earlier that Campos' wife and son were also on the plane, but that appears to be unconfirmed. In addition to Campos, two pilots, a campaign photographer, and a press advisor were also on the plane. Campos was 49 years old. He was third in the polls, according to Bloomberg. The election is set for October. Campos' plane reportedly lost contact with air traffic control as it was preparing to land, according to Reuters citing an Air Force statement. The Associated Press reports that the plane was trying to land in bad weather.

Reuters/ Jack CusanoBill Ackman is taking a piece of his hedge fund, Pershing Square, public, Bloomberg reports. In a letter to investors, published at Valuewalk, the billionaire wrote that he sees one of his fund's going public later this year, boosting the amount of permanent capital it holds. It will likely IPO on the London Stock Exchange. Pershing Square is up 32.1% year to date and 16.1% in the 2nd quarter, net of fees. Ackman wrote that over the last 10 years his fund is up 626.7%. It's a nice stat to point to before you take your company public — a la Carl Icahn. Because we are an active, control and influence-oriented investor, we have avoided being fully invested because of the risk of investor redemptions. For example, during 2009, despite a relatively strong 2008 and a 41% net return in 2009, we had to keep a substantial portion of our assets in cash because of the large amount of investor redemptions we received. We will hopefully begin to address this issue with the initial public offering of Pershing Square Holdings, Ltd. (PSH), targeted for later this year, which will increase the amount of our capital that is permanent. This capital raise will help Ackman continue his Icahn-like strategy too —  a breed of large cap, shareholder activism, the virtues of which he extols in the letter. Activism has a “public good” problem for the activist in that all of the other shareholders who typically comprise 90% or more of a target can be considered free riders with none of the costs or the illiquidity, and with all of the upside. The only investors who don’t materially benefit from the activist’s involvement are those that sell out into the activist’s accumulation of its toehold investment in the target, a stake which is typically less than 10% of shares outstanding. And even those sellers benefit, since they are able to sell at a price that has likely increased as a result of the activist’s purchases. The “public good” problem is a reasonable cost for the activist to bear because it is typically the largest shareholder of the corporation. Ackman also rails against those who would change SEC regulation to force activist shareholders to disclose their positions earlier than they have to now. The letter also addresses Ackman's infamous Herbalife short, saying that he may extend the position by paying more premiums.

REUTERS/Peter JonesDETROIT (Reuters) - The U.S. auto industry will have to offer more discounts to maintain demand as prices for used cars decline. With auto sales recovering from their recession-era slump, the industry's supply of used cars has started to rise again, driving down prices. This in turn will pressure new-car prices and raise the stakes for automakers, which have enjoyed the new-car sales renaissance of the last 4-1/2 years. To achieve annual sales above pre-recession levels of about 17 million new vehicles, "the automakers are going to have to increase incentives more," said Larry Dominique, executive vice president of research firm TrueCar Inc. TrueCar estimates used-car prices will drop 5.2 percent by 2017, while new-car incentives, now at about $2,700 per vehicle, will rise about 11 percent over the next two years to nearly $3,000. The National Automobile Dealers Association forecasts a nearly 7 percent decline in the average used-car price to just under $15,000 in 2016 from $16,025 in 2014. Meanwhile, new-car prices are rising because of the popularity of pricey features and more-expensive vehicles. They hit an average of $31,262 per vehicle last year and are expected to increase another 2 percent both this year and next, TrueCar said. U.S. new-car sales averaged 16.7 million vehicles annually in the decade that ended in 2007, but they skidded to 10.4 million in 2009. Demand rose at a double-digit pace in the three subsequent years, increased another 8 percent to 15.6 million last year, and is expected to top 16 million this year. Many of those cars, especially the ones coming off three-year lease deals, will be resold as used. Dominique said the average age of cars on the road, now topping 11 years, would creep down as newer-model used vehicles enter the market. Not everyone agrees. Pete DeLongchamps, vice president of U.S. dealer Group 1 Automotive Inc, said that while used-car prices would continue to drop, pent-up demand for new cars remained strong because so many people delayed buying during the recession. "There will be some shift in pricing, but I don't think it's enough to affect the market," he said. Group 1, which derives most of its earnings from parts, service and financing, sold almost as many used cars as new ones in its latest quarter. Still, used models accounted for only about 13 percent of gross profit, compared with almost 20 percent from new. Industry officials said still-high used-car prices had room to slip without significantly hurting new-car demand. "This is a long-term, regular cycle," NADA analyst David Wagner said, "and not a bubble." But while the auto industry, including U.S. automakers General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co, largely refrained from dramatically increasing profit-sapping incentives after the recession, experts have questioned whether that will hold given pressures the companies will face to increase sales and maintain share as demand growth slows. "As the wholesale prices decline with respect to new vehicles, clearly it's a negative," said Tom Webb, chief economist for wholesale car auction company Manheim. "You can get in somewhat of a downward spiral."   (Reporting by Ben Klayman in Detroit; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn) FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Mike BlakeTrainers have Orca killer whales perform for the crowd during a show at the animal theme park SeaWorld in San Diego on March 19.Like all companies, SeaWorld has an extensive section in its filings with the SEC that outline the business risks associated with the company. Earlier on Wednesday, the company announced second-quarter earnings and revenue that disappointed Wall Street, sending company shares tumbling to record lows. In its earnings press release, the company also said it thought attendance in the quarter was affected by "demand pressures related to recent media attention surrounding proposed legislation in the state of California." StreetInsider, citing comments from analysts at FBR Capital, said it was the first time the company acknowledged attendance pressure related to animal activism. On its second-quarter earnings conference call, when asked about the perception of the company's brands in the marketplace, the company said it saw "relative brand health." SeaWorld, however, is clearly dealing with some of the fallout from the controversial documentary, "Blackfish," which brought to light questions regarding the treatment of Orca whales. A January poll from Skift showed that 28% of Americans said they were less likely to visit SeaWorld after seeing Blackfish. Attendance at SeaWorld parks in the second quarter was up 0.3% over the prior year, though this figure compared with a quarter in which attendance fell 9%. This figure clearly didn't satiate too many concerns investors and Wall Street analysts have about the company. On the earnings call, at least two analysts asked the company about the language in its press release, which said attendance had a "tough comparison" with the prior year quarter. But SeaWorld, which operates its eponymous entertainment park, also deals with a wide-ranging and particularly, well, potentially, lethal mix of business risks. Per SeaWorld's latest annual report filed with the SEC on Form 10-K: Our theme parks feature numerous displays and interactions that include animals. All animal enterprises involve some degree of risk. All animal interaction by our employees and our guests in attractions in our theme parks, where offered, involves risk. While we maintain strict safety procedures for the protection of our employees and guests, injuries or death, while rare, have occurred in the past. For example, in February 2010, a trainer was killed while engaged in an interaction with a killer whale ... This incident has also been and continues to be the subject of significant media attention, including extensive television and newspaper coverage, a documentary and a book, as well as discussions in social media. This incident and similar events that may occur in the future may harm our reputation, reduce attendance and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. The company's financial position is also a risk unto itself, with the company in its 10-K stating simply: "We are highly leveraged." SeaWorld also faces what it calls a "complex and evolving regulatory environment." We incur significant compliance costs in connection with these regulations and violation of such regulations could subject us to fines and penalties and result in the loss of our licenses and permits, which, if occurred, could impact our ability to display certain animals ... For instance, in March of 2014 a bill was proposed by a California lawmaker that seeks to restrict our ability to display certain animals in that state ... While we seek to structure our operations to comply with all applicable federal and state laws and vigorously defend ourselves when sued, there are no assurances as to the outcome of future claims and lawsuits that could be brought against us. In addition, negative publicity associated with such activities could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations. In short, SeaWorld is in a tough business. SeaWorld, which went public in April 2013 after private-equity firm Blackstone took it private as part of a 2009 leveraged buyout, has had a rocky road in the past 15 months on the public market. As of SeaWorld's most recent annual filing with the SEC, Blackstone held 42.8% of the company's common stock. FREE AppDownload
"You Want To See Something Really Scary?" That headline is from The Twilight Zone movie, from when I was about 10 years old. As for the rest of the movie after that first moment, I experienced it as an audio-only event. I just stared down at my feet, too freaked out to look up above the seat in front of me.  I thought of the line this morning when I read an ordinary-seeming Wall Street Journal article about a legislative move to allow companies to continue to underfund their pensions. Corporate pension-funding, analogous to long-term retirement planning or college funding for individuals, really comes down to small choices that we make today that have extraordinary consequences thirty years in the future. This is the kind of thing which we – and our leaders – should worry about late at night. Instead of course we focus on strategizing about which reality TV star should strategically release a sex tape to revive her career, or which NFL player’s ongoing pattern of domestic abuse will cause a ‘distraction’ to his team during Sunday’s game. I guess I’m just saying we’re typically not spending enough time worrying about the really scary things, like under-funded pension liabilities. The WSJ article details that Congress passed, and Obama signed, a transportation bill that happens to contain a provision to allow companies temporary relief from fully funding their pension obligations. In the fine print of the article we learn that the pension-funding obligation comes from calculations of current interest rates, which are extraordinarily low. What companies wanted, and our leaders delivered, was a pension-funding formula that took into account interest rates of the last 25 years, rather than the last 2 years. This is a key difference. Here’s how I assume it works: If you observe that prevailing interest rates of, say, 10 year bonds are at 2%, then you have to make the assumption that all money invested in bonds for the next ten years will return just 2% per year. That’s reasonable. And from there you can calculate how much money you’ll have in 10 years, using compound interest. (see how I always work in a link to that idea?) The problem is that if you assume only a 2% return on your money, then you need to invest a lot more money today in order to actually have enough to meet the future obligations of your pension plan. If you could instead assume a bond rate of return of 6% – because that was the average interest rate over the past 25 years – then you need a lot less money to fund your pension plan. Problem magically solved. Companies are happy. CEOs are happy. Workers who depend on pensions eventually are unhappy. But hey! As Meatloaf says, 2 out 3 ain’t bad.  As I’ve written previously, the low returns of bonds are a major drawback of a low interest rate environment, when you have to have enough money for the long run. Endowments and charities and pensions that previously depended on a healthy bond portfolio to kick out 5-6% returns every year are stuck either generating less money for the long run, or they’re going far out onto the risky end of the investment spectrum (over-allocating to stocks or more exotic risks) to make the numbers work. Or, as we saw yesterday, just pretend you can get the returns on bonds that we got over the past 25 years. Ignore our actual historically low interest rates now with magical-thinking assumptions. By the way, what happens when companies underfund their pensions? If a company disappears or goes bust, the federal government (and therefore you and me, via taxes) picks up the unfunded pension liability through an agency known as the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. Just as the FDIC guarantees bank deposits (up to a certain size) and insurance regulators guarantee insurance payouts (when an insurance company fails), so does the PBGC pick up pension obligations when a private company with a pension goes bust. In 2010 for example, 147 companies with pension failed, and the PBGC paid our $5.6 Billion in liabilities to pensioners. A big factor in the GM and Chrysler bankruptcy and bailouts of 2008, for example, had to do with the government pension guaranties. For some time before 2008, GM and Chrysler had morphed from car manufacturers with large pension plans into giant pension-liability companies that also happened to make some cars (that not enough people actually buy anymore.) I can’t claim to know the details of the agreement signed into law yesterday, but using tricks like a 25 year average on historic interest rates, rather than current interest rates, should keep us up all night, rather frightened.

Flickr/Naoki Hiroshima On Tuesday the winners of the most prestigious award in mathematics — the Fields Medal — were announced. The award is given to two to four mathematicians under age 40 every four years "to recognize outstanding mathematical achievement for existing work and for the promise of future achievement." This award is typically given for mathematical research that solves or extends complicated problems that mathematicians have struggled with for decades or even centuries. And, believe it or not, one of the winners, Manjul Bhargava, reformulated a 200-year-old number theory problem in a rather unconventional way: by using a Rubik's Cube and Sanskrit texts. But before we get to his idea, let's go over some background. Here's an interesting mathematical idea: If two numbers that are each the sum of two perfect squares are multiplied together, the resulting number will also be the sum of two perfect squares. Let's take the numbers 25 (a perfect square of 5) and 36 (a perfect square of 6) and add them together as an example. The resulting equation would read: (25 + 25)(36 + 36) = 3600, where 3600 equals ((36*36) + (48*48)), or (1296 + 2304). You can keep trying this with all different number combinations — as long as the four numbers in the brackets are perfect squares — and the output will always also be a perfect square. (Yes, math is awesome.) But let's get back to Bhargava. His grandfather, Purushottam Lal Bhargava, was the head of the Sanskrit department of the University of Rajasthan — and so "Bhargava grew up reading ancient mathematics and Sanskrit poetry texts," according to Quanta Magazine. In one of these manuscripts, he discovered a "generalization [similar to the above math] developed in the year 628 by the great Indian mathematician Brahmagupta" that stated: If two numbers that are each the sum of a perfect square and a given whole number times a perfect square are multiplied together, the product will again be the sum of a perfect square and that whole number times another perfect square. Later on, when he was a graduate student, Bhargava learned that Carl Gauss — a leading mathematical figure of the 18th and 19th century "came up with a complete description of these kinds of relationships" — provided that the expressions had only two variables, and only quadratic forms (meaning x2, but not x3). Essentially, Gauss came up with a "composition law" that would tell you which quadratic form you'd get if you multiplied two of these kinds of expressions together. But here's the downside: Gauss' law took him approximately 20 pages to write out. Ouch. No one wants to read through all of that. Bhargava was interested in uncovering an easier way to describe Gauss' law — and perhaps if he could tackle higher exponents, according to Quanta Magazine. Then one day, Bhargava thought of a solution when he was sitting in his room, looking at a Rubik's Cube. He took a mini-cube (a 2x2 Rubik's Cube) and "realized that if he were to place numbers on each corner of the mini-cube and then cut the cube in half, the eight corner numbers could be combined in a natural way to produce a binary quadratic form," according to Quanta Magazine. If you think about a Rubik's Cube, you'll note that there are three ways to cut the cube in half. You can split the top from the bottom; you can split the right from the left; you can split the front from the back.  In fancy math terms, that means that by cutting a Rubik's cube in three ways, you can generate "three quadratic forms."  The interesting thing about this, is that Bhargava discovered that these quadratic forms "add up to zero" — not when using normal addition, but "with respect to Gauss' method for composing quadratic forms."  And ta-da, by simply dividing a Rubik's Cube, he "gave a new and elegant reformulation of Gauss' 20-age law." Bhargava said about this moment to the New Scientist: Gauss's law says that you can compose two quadratic forms, which you can think of as a square of numbers, to get a third square. I was in California in the summer of 1998, and I had a 2 x 2 x 2 mini Rubik's cube. I was just visualising putting numbers on each of the corners, and I saw these binary quadratic forms coming out, three of them. I just sat down and wrote out the relations between them. It was a great day! Afterward, Bhargava worked with a Rubik's Domino (a 2x3x3 shape) — and he realized that he could go beyond the limited quadratic forms of Gauss' law.  Eventually, he went on to discover 12 more compositional laws, which later became his Ph.D. thesis. According to Quanta Magazine, Barghava said that he had always been interested in ideas like this — the “problems that are easy to state, and when you hear them, you think they’re somehow so fundamental that we have to know the answer.”   FREE AppDownload
ReutersKim Kardashian. In a note released Wednesday morning, Deutsche Bank downgraded the media company, citing two major reasons. First, the company hasn't repeated the success of its addictive hit game "Candy Crush," and second, Deutsche Bank thinks it is simply too expensive to play King games — and other cheaper games are taking share as a result. On Tuesday, King reported a drop in sales and missed analyst estimates in its quarterly earnings report. This was, for the most part, due to the waning popularity in "Candy Crush." The company is focused on developing new games, but none of them have caught on like the "Crush" — now the stock is getting pummeled, down 23%. In its report, Deutsche Bank downgraded King from "buy" to "hold" and cut its price target on the stock from $27 to $12 dollars. From the report: King’s 2Q saga started with a bang but ended with a whimper, as the company saw a step down in monetization across its portfolio late in the quarter. Management struggled to explain this decline, though seasonality and the World Cup seem to have played a role. Despite a relatively stable network size,the company saw a geographic user shift away from the US towards lower monetizing regions. The number of paying users fell 12% Q/Q to 10.4M in 2Q from 11.9M in 1Q, though increased MGABPPU [Monthly Gross Average Bookings per Paying User] helped offset some of this decline. Competition within casual gaming is intense, with Kim Kardashian: Hollywood and 2048 going after the same demographics. In other words, King says it's losing share to cheaper, equally addictive games. And why not? The way Deutsche Bank sees it, a "Candy Crush"-King addiction can be one of the most expensive forms of entertainment after live concerts. Deutsche Bank calculates that if the average King game player spends $19.54 (per the company's own 2Q14 data) and plays for about 4.5 hours, they're spending $4.34 an hour.

Flickr / GmanVizCar sales are booming, and banks are doing brisk business in auto loans, especially subprime loans for borrowers with poor credit or no credit at all. That has many analysts worried that we're seeing a bubble in the subprime market — that same sort of bubble that burst in 2007/2008 and helped hurl us into the Great Recession. According to Bloomberg, however, those fears are likely misplaced. The New York Fed's Matthew Ward agrees that the subprime market is growing, but he points out that it's growing in proper proportion to non-subprime loans. As a percentage of the whole, subprimes now make up about 28 percent of all auto loans. Ward notes that subprimes "are just recently approaching historically 'normal' levels" and remain lower than they were in the years leading up to the Great Recession. It's true that people are taking out slightly larger loans than they did in 2005 and 2006. However, car prices have increased over the past decade: the average cost of a new car currently hovers above $30,000, rising nearly nine percent in the past four years alone. During those same four years, the average salary grew only four percent. Simply put, buying a car takes more dough these days. That's why Americans owe a record-high $902 billion in auto loans. While that may sound ominous, the good news is, most borrowers are paying on time. Perhaps that's because they've been chastened by the Great Recession and are trying to be more responsible with their money. Or perhaps it's a sign that people have good jobs: after all, millions of Americans drive to work each day, and without a car in the garage, that task becomes much, much more difficult. (That helps explain why many consumers who find themselves in a pinch will pay their car note before their mortgage and credit cards.) If you're planning to purchase a new or used car and you need financing, just remember: go to the dealership fully prepared, or you may leave the dealership having paid through the nose.

Thomson ReutersA Costco shopping cart is shown at a Costco Wholesale store in Carlsbad, CaliforniaWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. business inventories rose in June, but a modest gain in stocks at non-automobile retailers suggested that the growth estimate for the second quarter could be revised a bit lower. The Commerce Department said on Wednesday inventories increased 0.4 percent after rising 0.5 percent in May. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast inventories, which are a key component of gross domestic product changes, advancing 0.4 percent in June. Retail inventories, excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, gained 0.3 percent after being flat in May. That was less than the government had assumed in its advance second-quarter GDP estimate published last month. In that report, the government said inventories added 1.66 percentage points to GDP growth, which expanded at a 4.0 percent annual pace. Data on wholesale and manufacturing inventories released last week suggested the second-quarter growth estimate could be cut by as much as half a percentage point when the government publishes its revisions later this month. The smaller inventory pile bodes well for third-quarter GDP. In June, business sales rose 0.3 percent after a similar gain the prior month. At June's sales pace, it would take 1.29 months for businesses to clear shelves, unchanged from May.   (Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Andrea Ricci) FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersPeople walk past a poster depicting U.S. Judge Griesa as a vulture in Buenos AiresBy Hugh Bronstein BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina came out swinging on Wednesday against the U.S. judge overseeing its debt default case, in defiance of a threatened contempt order, and disappointed market hopes it might soon restart talks with the hedge funds suing the country. A group of holdout investors have sued the South American country for full repayment on bonds that went into default in 2002. The funds rejected debt restructurings in 2005 and 2010, holding out for better terms. U.S. Judge Thomas Griesa, overseeing Argentina's long-running battle with the funds, said in New York on Friday that he would issue a contempt order unless the government stopped claiming it had met its obligations and was not in default. Far from backing off of those assertions, Cabinet Chief Jorge Capitanich said Griesa had been paralyzed by his own lack of understanding of the case and that no new talks had been scheduled with the hedge funds. "The proper conditions do not exist to negotiate," Capitanich said. Holders of restructured bonds have asked Griesa to release money that Argentina had deposited in June, intended as a coupon payment. Capitanich criticized the judge for not acting on those requests. "His lack of decision clearly comes from not understanding the process, not understanding Argentina's status as a sovereign country, not understanding that his actions violate sovereign immunity, which transcends judicial concerns and enters the realm of international relations, which are managed by the executive branch of the U.S. government," Capitanich said. In 2012, Griesa ruled that Argentina could not repay holders of restructured debt without also paying hedge funds their court award of $1.33 billion plus interest at the same time. Argentina says it met its obligation to the holders of restructured bonds when it deposited $539 million into the account of intermediary Bank of New York Mellon in June. Griesa called the deposit illegal and ordered the money frozen. As a result, Argentina effectively missed the coupon payment after a grace period ended on July 30, pushing it into default on its restructured debt. With no negotiations scheduled, the case was in limbo while international banks struggled to reach a deal to buy some of the Argentine debt held by the hedge funds led by Elliott Management Corp and Aurelius Capital Ltd. "The judge cannot issue an order of contempt because he cannot enforce it against a sovereign country," Capitanich said. "He cannot embargo the funds because they do not belong to Argentina, but to the (restructured) bondholders. The judge cannot make any decision because he knows he would be effectively violating contracts," he added. "The only thing he is doing, at the express instruction of the vultures, is to block the payment process after Argentina met its obligations," Capitanich said. Argentina has long accused the judge of overstepping his bounds and being partial toward the funds, which bought Argentine bonds at steep discounts and are characterized by President Cristina Fernandez as "vultures" out to wreck her country's finances in their pursuit of huge profits. The case could get a lot messier should holders of Argentina's newly defaulted debt decide to declare principal and interest immediately due. The move, known as acceleration, could complicate efforts to put the country's debt woes to rest. An acceleration on the restructured bonds would also deal a blow to the hedge funds in the case, who could suddenly have to share their claim with a much larger pool of investors. The International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) Determinations Committee had a conference call scheduled for Wednesday to discuss the next step in settling the prices on what investors will receive for credit default swap contracts on Argentine debt, a side issue to the main dispute.

Thomson ReutersThe facade of the U.S. Federal Reserve building is reflected on wet marble during the early morning hours in WashingtonBy Moriah Costa WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to move in baby steps when it starts to bump up borrowing costs from a record low, but it won't do so until the second quarter of next year, according to the latest Reuters poll of economists. Recent data on employment, manufacturing and services suggest the economy is on a firm footing, but the Fed has said monetary support is still needed given what it calls the "significant" slack in the labor market. The central bank has held the overnight federal funds rate near zero since December 2008, and is close to winding down a lengthy program of bond purchases that will have swelled its balance sheet to more than $4 trillion. But it is not likely to raise the fed funds rate until the second quarter of next year, most likely in June, according to the median forecast of 74 analysts polled in the past week. That projection, unchanged from a survey last month, suggests a somewhat earlier move than predicted by a smaller sample of the Wall Street primary bond dealers who deal directly with the Fed, in a poll earlier this month. [FED/R] Interest rate futures are pricing the first rate hike in the third quarter of next year. When the Fed does get moving, it will proceed cautiously. "There's quite a few worries for them still in the cards. That should keep them hiking rates quite a bit slower than we've seen in previous hiking cycles," said Gennadiy Goldberg, a strategist at TD Securities in New York. The latest survey showed that rates would be at 1.00 percent at the end of next year, 2.25 percent at the end of 2016 and 3.25 percent a year after that. The Fed sees 3.75 percent as appropriate for the economy over the longer run. Yet all anecdotal evidence suggests that Fed Chair Janet Yellen is in no hurry to raise interest rates, preferring to fight inflation than another economic downturn. The poll also found analysts had grown more optimistic about U.S. economic growth in 2014 after a strong second quarter, with forecasts for the year rising to 2.0 percent from 1.7 percent in July. The median projection for 2015 remained at 3.0 percent but the forecast for 2016 dipped to 2.9 percent from 3.0 percent. Growth in non-farm payrolls was seen averaging around 210,000 jobs per month over the rest of this year and 215,000 per month during the first half of next year before slowing slightly. So far this year, payroll growth has averaged 230,000 per month. The unemployment rate for 2014 was forecast at an average of 6.2 percent, where it stood last month and unchanged from last month's poll. It was seen falling to 5.7 percent in 2015 and to 5.5 percent in 2016, unchanged from the previous poll. The survey projected inflation as measured by the consumer price index would run close to 2 percent across the forecast horizon, with core inflation rising to 2.1 percent in 2015 and 2016. The Fed targets 2 percent inflation, although it focuses on the PCE prices index, which tends to run below the CPI. Despite the unemployment rate falling and inflation rising toward the Fed's target, Yellen has in the last six months managed to shift investors' attention to stagnant wage growth. But a majority, 32 of 41 economists who answered an extra question, said the Fed will proceed to hike its interest rate even if wage growth does not accelerate as expected. "While the Fed would like a faster increase in wages, if all other indicators are showing sustained health in the labor market and substantive reductions in labor market slack, the FOMC would be hard put to find a reason not to hike rates," said Terry Sheehan, economic analyst at Stone &amp; McCarthy.

U.S. oil imports are at lows not seen in 19 years, standing at 7.17 million barrels a day in May, according to the EIA. That's down 26% since 2008.    The reason is booming supply and sluggish demand growth. The IEA announced yesterday that the U.S. production grew 1.1 million barrels a day year-on-year in May, roughly equivalent to adding the total crude oil supply of Colombia to the world in just 12 months.   Meanwhile at 20.3 million barrels a day, the U.S. remains well below pre-recession consumption levels.    Here's the import chart: EIA FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Brendan McDermidA mascot dressed as a character from the mobile game "Candy Crush Saga" walks the floor of the New York Stock Exchange during the IPO of Mobile game maker King Digital Entertainment Plc March 26, 2014. After a disappointing earnings report, King Digital, the parent company of Candy Crush, is getting destroyed this morning.  The stock is down ~25% this morning. King reported lighter than expected revenue, and lowered its outlook for the year. It also reported a sequential drop in users.  At the same time, it announced plans for a $150 million dividend to shareholders. This is pretty unusual for a company that just went public in May. King has plenty of money in the bank so it can afford it. But, the dividend, which is normally supposed to make investors happy seems to have had the opposite impact. It's like King is waving the white flag and saying, "We don't have good ideas for a new game, so we're just going to return a little money to shareholders." FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersThe Federal Reserve Bank of Boston's President and CEO Eric S. Rosengren speaks during the "Hyman P. Minsky Conference on the State of te U.S. and World Economies", in New YorkNEW YORK (Reuters) - A serious re-evaluation of how broker-dealers are supervised is overdue and should bring about higher capital requirements given the threat broker-dealers still pose to the U.S. financial system, a top Federal Reserve official said on Wednesday. Eric Rosengren, the president of the Boston Fed and among the U.S. central bank's most influential voices on regulating wholesale markets, floated several rule changes that would limit the firms' reliance on short-term wholesale funding and reduce the risk of runs. The Fed and other regulators have been pushing firms to bulk up their capital to avoid a repetition of the 2008 financial crisis, in which Lehman Brothers' failure highlighted how quickly broker-dealers can lose investors' confidence and access to cheap funds. A "comprehensive re-evaluation of broker-dealer regulation is overdue," Rosengren said in remarks prepared for delivery to a conference at the New York Fed on wholesale funding risks. His speech appeared to bolster the stance of Fed Chair Janet Yellen, and offer a handful of approaches as regulators attempt to fill in the gaps left by the landmark 2010 Dodd-Frank financial regulation law. While the most direct way to reduce runs on brokers is higher capital standards, Rosengren said regulators could also limit the extent to which the firms could use short-term repurchase agreements to fund longer-term or higher-risk assets. Money market mutual funds could be prohibited from holding repos secured by such assets, many of which they are not allowed to hold, he said. Rosengren also floated the Fed as a permanent liquidity backstop for broker-dealers - though he acknowledged that such an outcome seemed "unlikely." Such moves "would have an impact on the profitability of broker-dealers," he said in his remarks. "But given recent history, that trade-off may be unavoidable and in the public interest from a financial stability perspective." Rosengren did not comment on monetary policy or the economy.

Getty ImagesAgricultural giant Deere &amp; Co. just announced third quarter earnings, reporting earnings and revenue that topped expectations. For its fiscal-year 2014, Deere expects revenue to fall 6% over the prior year, a steeper decline than the 4% that Wall Street had been expecting. Along with its earnings report, Deere also released a 42-slide presentation giving an update on the state of global agriculture. As a major global supplier of tractors and other ag equipment, Deere keeps close tabs on the state of the commodity market.  Over the last few months, corn, wheat, and a number of other commodities have seen prices decline sharply. We've pulled seven slides from Deere's presentation to provide some color on the current state of agriculture and the broader global economy. FREE AppDownload
@ReutersCulpRetail sales went nowhere in July, showing 0.0% growth. This was the worst reading in six months. Economists were looking for a 0.2% gain. Excluding autos and gas, sales climbed by just 0.1%, missing expectations for a 0.4% gain. Among the areas of strength was clothing. "Clothing increased 0.4% primarily on the extreme discounting at related stores as many retailers rid the shelves of summer apparel, making way for the back-to-school season — the second largest season after Christmas holiday spending," said Bloomberg economists Richard Yamarone and Josh Wright. "A bit disappointing but the trend is OK and August should be better," said Pantheon Macroeconomics Ian Shepherdson. "Core sales in the three months to July compared to the previous three months rose at a decent 6.2% annualized rate, but this is now set to slow. Consumers just don't have the cashflow to financed sustained gains above 4%. Even assuming an Aug rebound, Q3 consumption looks to be heading for only 2% or so." The economists at Capital Economics' are a bit more upbeat. "There are three reasons why today’s news doesn’t mean that the third quarter will be a write-off," Capital Economics' Paul Dales said. "First, some of the weakness in July is probably just payback from the strength in sales in previous months. Second, the combination of faster income growth, rising wealth and easier access to credit should support spending over the rest of the year. Third, the business surveys have improved, suggesting that spending in other parts of the economy remains strong. As such, the economy will still be much stronger in the second half of the year than in the first." Here's a breakdown of retail sales growth by business: Census FREE AppDownload

Macy's same-store sales rose just 3.4% in the second quarter, compared to last year. The company reported a profit of 80 cents a share, up from  72 cents a year ago, and revenue increased to $6.27 billion from $6.07 billion last year. Analysts were expecting a profit of 86 cents a share on revenue of $6.3 billion.  The company said its expectations for the second half of 2014 remain on track, with an outlook of same-store sales growth of 2% to 3%.

Thomson ReutersFile photo of shoppers riding the escalator at Macy's Herald Square in New York(Reuters) - Macy's Inc cut its full-year same-store sales forecast, saying a 3.3 percent rise in second-quarter sales would not make up for weakness in the first quarter when harsh weather kept shoppers away. Shares of the company, which also owns the high-end Bloomingdale's chain, were down 5 percent at $56.77 in premarket trading. Macy's said it expects same-store sales to increase 1.5 percent to 2 percent for the full year. It had earlier forecast an increase of 2.5 percent to 3 percent. The company's net income rose to $292 million, or 80 cents per share, in the three months ended Aug. 2 from $281 million, or 72 cents per share, a year earlier.

Thomson ReutersThe Jaguar logo is pictured at a Jaguar Land Rover showroom in MumbaiDETROIT (Reuters) - Jaguar Land Rover is recalling 40,551 Land Rover sport utility vehicles in the United States because the front passenger air bag may not deploy due to a part failure, according to documents filed with U.S. safety regulators. There have been no reports of accidents or injuries relating to the issue in the United States, the filings with the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said. Jaguar Land Rover officials could not immediately be reached on Wednesday for comment on whether SUVs in other markets may have been affected. The company, a unit of Tata Motors, is recalling certain 2010 to 2015 LR2 luxury compact SUVs, and 2012 and 2013 Range Rover Evoque SUVs, because a part in the occupant classification system electronic control unit may fail, disabling the passenger air bag partially or completely. Dealers will update the restraint control module software at no cost and the recall is expected to begin on Aug. 30, according to the NHTSA documents. Affected in the recall are about 17,066 LR2 and 23,485 Range Rover Evoque SUVs in the United States and U.S. territories.

Thomson ReutersA new John Deere tractor waits for a buyer at a dealer in Longmont(Reuters) - Deere &amp; Co on Wednesday posted a lower quarterly profit and cut its full-year forecast as farmers facing a bumper crop and declining grain prices continued to pull back on purchases of the company's tractors, harvesters and other machinery. The Moline, Illinois-based company reported a net profit of $850.7 million, or $2.33 a share, for the third quarter ended July 31, compared with $996.5 million, or $2.56 a share, a year earlier. Sales fell 5 percent to $9.5 billion. Analysts on average expected Deere to post a profit of $2.22 a share on sales of $8.75 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The stronger-than-expected quarterly profit resulted from sales of the company's construction and forestry equipment, which benefited from a rebound in U.S. nonresidential building. But Deere said it now expected to earn $3.1 billion in fiscal 2014, down from its previous forecast of $3.3 billion, because of falling farm income in the United States, among other factors. The company said it expected total U.S. farm cash receipts, which correlate closely with investment in new farm equipment, to fall to $387.1 billion in 2014, down from $407.1 billion in 2013 and below its previous forecast of $392.7 billion. Shares of Deere were down 0.7 percent at $85.84 in premarket trading.  (Reporting by James B. Kelleher in Chicago; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Lisa Von Ahn) FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Jim Young Bill Gross, co-founder and co-chief investment officer of Pacific Investment Management Company (PIMCO), speaks at the Morningstar Investment Conference in ChicagoNEW YORK (Reuters) - Marc Seidner, who left Pimco earlier this year just as the fixed income powerhouse was about to be roiled by internal strife, is beating his old boss Bill Gross at a game Gross used to dominate: calling the bond market. Seidner sensed that last year's Treasury market upheaval triggered by speculation about when the Federal Reserve would start reducing its bond-buying stimulus - the so-called "taper tantrum" - had left pockets of value in some longer-dated bonds. At Pimco, to make a big bet Seidner had to seek the approval of Gross, known in financial markets as "the Bond King." But now as head of fixed income at the Boston-based money management firm run by contrarian investor Jeremy Grantham, Seidner was able to make a counter-intuitive call that bond yields would fall, not rise further as many had predicted. The upshot? Seidner's bet was on the money. His core U.S. bond fund is outpacing 98 percent of its peers and easily beating Gross’s Pimco Total Return Fund &lt;pttrx.o&gt;, the world’s biggest bond portfolio, as the yield on the 10-year Treasury note has fallen roughly 60 basis points this year. At Grantham Mayo Otterloo &amp; Co (GMO), Seidner's $240 million GMO Core Plus Bond III &lt;gugax.o&gt;, is posting returns of 6.05 percent so far this year as of July 31, according to Morningstar data. By contrast, the Pimco Total Return Fund, with $223 billion in assets, is posting returns of 3.16 percent for the same time period, lagging 77 percent of its category peers. While there is a huge difference in the size of the funds - and it is much easier to maneuver with a smaller fund like Seidner's - they are regarded as directly comparable for bond investors. "There is life after Pimco," Seidner said in an interview, his first since leaving the Newport Beach, California-based Pimco in January after turning down an offer to become one of Gross's top lieutenants. Seidner, 48, resigned just hours before Pimco stunned the asset management world by announcing Mohamed El-Erian's plan to step down as the firm's chief executive, the result of a falling out over Gross's leadership style and investment strategy. Long considered to be in line to succeed Gross as the firm's top investment executive, El-Erian was also a close confidant of Seidner. "I personally resigned to Gross," Seidner said, declining to comment further about their conversation or on the schism between Gross and El-Erian. Seidner had worked at the Harvard University endowment when El-Erian ran it and he joined Pimco when El-Erian returned to the firm from Boston in 2009. Through a spokeswoman, Gross and Pimco declined to comment on Seidner's departure or his performance since leaving Pimco, which is part of Germany's Allianz &lt;alvg.de&gt;. PROBING THE BELLY OF THE CURVE Last year's mixed signals from the Fed about when it would cut back on its $85 billion a month of bond buying badly hurt the performance of large sections of the Treasury market, and Seidner sensed the damage was overdone. For instance, the Barclays Aggregate index that tracks the so-called belly of the yield curve - maturities from seven to 10 years - finished the year with its worst annual performance on record: negative 6.04 percent on a total return basis. The 10-year yield ended 2013 near its high of the year at just above 3 percent. "The taper tantrum of spring and summer of 2013 left the term premium in the belly of the U.S. curve attractively priced from an historic risk-reward perspective," Seidner said. After arriving at GMO, where he is responsible for $21 billion of fixed income assets, Seidner targeted that section of the curve using Treasury futures and interest rate swaps, betting that the winding down of the Fed's bond buying did not mean the Fed would be quick to raise interest rates. On Tuesday, the 10-year yield stood at 2.45 percent and last week reached a 14-month low below 2.35 percent. The Barclays 7-10 year Treasury index has a positive total return so far in 2014 of 6.12 percent. Meanwhile, his old boss Gross eschewed that call, arguing instead that bonds maturing in five to 30 years were "at risk" given reduced bond buying from the Fed. His resulting bias toward the front end of the yield curve contributed significantly to his underperformance. Another call of Seidner's that is at odds with the Gross-led Pimco view is that market volatility, which has been suppressed across assets for most of the last year, is likely to pick up. Shortly after his arrival at GMO, Seidner told his investment team: "Selling options today is like picking pennies in front of the steamroller," as he stressed that there was little room left for measures of market volatility to fall. Gross, meanwhile, has bet that low volatility will persist for the next three to five years. In the last two weeks, the CBOE Volatility Index &lt;.VIX&gt;, or VIX, jumped to its highest levels since March and a main measure of bond market volatility tracked by Merrill Lynch has begun moving higher as well. HIRING SPREE Seidner said his focus since leaving Pimco has been building out his team at GMO, with an aim to hire up to a dozen new quantitative and fundamental analysts and portfolio managers. . Seidner said he recently hired Michael Emanuel, who was portfolio manager at Convexity Capital Management, as GMO's portfolio manager of global bond markets and interest rates, and Mike Herald, formerly managing director of CRT Capital Group, to build out GMO's structured finance products and as a non-agency trader. GMO and Grantham are best known for their strength in emerging markets and big macro calls, often at odds with the rest of the market. Seidner said GMO is looking to build a fixed-income business that is nimble and flexible and isn't tethered to any benchmarks. "I think most firms approach fixed-income the wrong way," he said. "When someone starts a firm, they have analysts and portfolio managers who are experts in credit, interest rates, government bonds, which creates cheerleaders, not objective thinkers. "We're going to build a completely opportunistic approach as objective thinkers who focus on where we are being compensated for risk-taking – not just about security and sector selection because it's in the Barclays Aggregate Index," Seidner said.   (Reporting By Jennifer Ablan; Editing by Dan Burns and Martin Howell) FREE AppDownload
Sony Pictures / Columbia Prices are rising for independent brokers because of demand from investors and other firms, while supply is low because advisers have made steady money through a five-year bull market and are waiting to sell. At the same time the major brokerages — Bank of America's Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, and UBS — are fighting to keep their money-making assets from walking out the door. For Jim Pratt-Heaney and Bill Lomas, two longtime brokers who left Merrill Lynch in 2008 to found Connecticut registered investment advisory group LLBH Private Wealth Management, the financial benefits were key. Both told Reuters they had no doubt they would get more money selling their shares of their independent business than Merrill Lynch would have offered them. "The idea that we didn't own equity in our business as an adviser with a major wirehouse was concerning to us," said Lomas, 56. Almost 100,000 brokers — or about one-third of the industry — are expected to reach retirement age over the next 10 years, according to research firm Cerulli Associates, and the thoughts of many are turning to how to pay for it. Big firms usually compensate departing brokers for the book of business they leave behind. Typically, brokerages pay between 0.85 and 1.4 times the annual revenue generated by the adviser, according to Nate Lenz, director of acquisitions for Raymond James Financial Services. The amount is usually paid out over three or four years, as long as the broker's clients stay with the firm, and the money is considered salary and subject to federal, state and local income taxes. At those rates, a broker bringing in $750,000 a year in fees and commissions could receive $1.05 million at best over four years, which if taxed at the highest federal rate of 39.6 percent would leave the broker with $634,200. By contrast, surging demand at a time when few wealth management firms are for sale means that a business owner with a high portion of fee-based revenue can now sell for an average of two to 2 1/4 times annual revenue, Lenz said. So a broker with a $750,000 annual book could sell for at least $1.5 million, using the lower multiple. For that seller, the proceeds — less his investment in the business — would be subject to capital gains taxes, not income taxes. Capital gains taxes top out at 20 percent, so the broker could walk away with at least $1.2 million. That extra money is attractive to the 55 percent of financial advisers who have said they expect the majority of their retirement savings to come from the sale of their businesses, according to a recent survey conducted by asset manager CLS Investments. For example, Gerald "Zeke" Strid, 72, along with his sons Erik and Paul, left Wells Fargo Advisers to take the family's Philadelphia-based business, Concentus Wealth Management, independent about six months ago. After 45 years, Gerald said he felt he owned his business because it is based on relationships he built with clients. For now, he is going to hold on to equity and transition some clients to his sons, but when he does step away, he expects to do better financially than he would have retiring from Wells. "You get a higher valuation at a lower tax level; that’s pretty compelling to people who make their living as financial advisers," said Shirl Penney, chief executive officer of Dynasty Financial Partners, a wealth management firm in New York. "It's a seller's market right now.” Potential buyers include Raymond James Financial Services &lt;rjf.n&gt;, which is rolling out a program to help its independent advisers to find others who are ready to sell and retire. In 2013, some 54 independent advisory firms were sold nationwide, up 20 percent from the 43 deals that were done in 2012, according to a report by Schwab Advisor Services. Steven Dudash, a broker who left Merrill with a team of five in June to launch IHT Wealth Management, said he planned to buy businesses of retiring Chicago area advisers. In his first few weeks of business, he has already fielded calls from interested brokers at all the four biggest brokerages, among others. Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley recently added incentives for retiring brokers. Merrill changed its policies to let retiring brokers stay on as senior consultants for a period of time they determine. That gives them a salary based on their last 12 month's revenue while they deliver a smooth handoff of their clients to a successor. In May, Morgan Stanley &lt;ms.n&gt; started giving brokers pre-retirement bonuses of up to 50 percent of the adviser's trailing 12 months' revenue, delivered before the adviser retires, and separate from the account payout that brokers get, according to a source familiar with the deals. The payout comes once the adviser joins a four-year program and starts transitioning their clients on to another adviser. "We're forcing people to want to switch firms to try to monetize the value of the book (advisers) created, and I don't think that's good for the adviser, I don't think that's good for the clients," said Joe Nadreau, head of innovation and strategy at Wells Fargo Advisers. He said Wells was considering changes to its retirement policies but was not certain of the details. UBS did not respond to requests for comment. Still, not every broker who goes independent is prepared to start running a business after a lifetime of being an employee, said Mark Tibergien, chief executive officer of BNY Mellon's brokerage Pershing Advisor Solutions, and a long time expert on the financial advice business. "If you're not prepared to be a business owner, you are going to spend your tax benefits making up for the clients you lost," he said.

REUTERS/Alexei DruzhininRussian President Vladimir Putin, left, and his Egyptian counterpart Abdel Fattah al-Sisi at a ceremony welcoming onboard guided missile cruiser Moskva at the Black Sea port of Sochi on Tuesday.Good morning! Here's what you need to know: Markets Are Up. Stock markets around the world are nicely in the green following a mix of economic news. Asia closed up with Japan's Nikkei climbing 0.3% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng gaining 0.8%. In Europe, Britain's FTSE is up 0.4%, France's CAC 40 is up 0.8%, and Germany's DAX is up 1.1%. U.S. futures are firmly in the green with Dow futures up 67 points and S&amp;P futures up 9.3 points. The Eurozone Continues To Be A Huge Mess. The eurozone's new June industrial output report was just the latest in a string of disappointing economic reports coming out of the region. "Output at factory gates single currency bloc fell 0.3% on the month in June after a 1.1% drop in May, against market expectations of a 0.3% rise," reported Reuters' Martin Santa. "It was the lowest annual reading since August 2013." Bank Of England's Carney Says Rate Hikes Will Be 'Gradual And Limited.' "Mark Carney said global political risks and the euro region’s weakness might weigh on Britain’s recovery as he insisted that the Bank of England won’t raise interest rates too soon or too fast," reported Bloomberg's Scott Hamilton. "Speaking after a mixed labor market report that showed the first drop in wages since 2009 and the lowest unemployment since 2008, the BOE governor said that Britain’s growth 'faces some challenges.' Emphasizing the weakness of pay growth, he said that policy makers share a similar view to investors on the path of interest rates being “gradual and limited." The First Big Central Bank To Raise Rates. "The Bank of England's inflation forecasts are consistent with the first rate increase coming in February," said Bloomberg economists Jamie Murray and Niraj Shah. "The outlook released today puts the rate of inflation close to 2% at the end of the BoE's forecast period, validating those market expectations." A February rate hike would come months before economists' forecast for when the Federal Reserve will begin hiking rates. Japan's GDP Collapses. Japan's GDP fell 6.8% in Q2, reversing a 6.1% spike in Q1. While the drop is jarring, it wasn't totally unexpected. In fact, economists were actually forecasting a 7.0% decline. Late in 2013, Japan announced a consumption tax hike that would go into effect in April. This caused Japanese consumers to shop like crazy in Q1 in anticipation of the tax, pulling forward sales that would've occurred in Q2 China's Money Flow Is Slowing. "The amount of money flowing into China's economy slowed to the lowest level in nearly six years in July, adding to fears that a sustained recovery may be at risk in the second half of the year despite government efforts to shore up growth," reported Reuters' Xiaoyi Shao. "China's total social financing (TSF) aggregate, a broad measure of liquidity in the economy, fell to 273.1 billion yuan ($44.34 billion) in July, about one seventh of that in June and the lowest monthly reading since October 2008 in the depths of the global financial crisis." Candy Crushed. Mobile game maker King Digital reported quarterly earnings that were right in line with expectations. However, revenue was light. The stock fell by around 20% after the report. Mortgage Applications Tumble. Demand for U.S. mortgages fell last week. "The Mortgage Bankers Association said its seasonally adjusted index of mortgage application activity, which includes both refinancing and home purchase demand, fell 2.7% in the week ended Aug. 8," reported Reuters' Caroline Valetkevitch. "The MBA's seasonally adjusted index of refinancing applications fell 4.0%, while the gauge of loan requests for home purchases, a leading indicator of home sales, fell 1.0%." Get Ready For The Retail Sales Report. We'll get the July U.S. retail sales report at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists estimate sales climbed by 0.2% in July, or 0.4% excluding autos and gas. "Early indications point to solid upside in retail sales in July," Morgan Stanley's Ted Wieseman said. "Unit auto sales fell to a 16.4 million unit annual rate in July from an eight-year high of 16.8 million in June, but industry reports indicated that the pullback reflected lower fleet sales, while retail sales rose. Meanwhile, our AlphaWise team’s data pointed to a solid rise in ex autos and gas sales, and our retail analysts in equity research saw somewhat muted mall sales trends in July but indications of early back-to-school sales being off to a good start. So we look for a solid further 0.4% gain in the core “retail control” category on top of a 0.5% rise in June." The SEC Is Probing Hedge Fund-Like Mutual Funds. "The Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a broad examination of alternative mutual funds, according to people familiar with the matter, kicking off regulatory scrutiny of one of the hottest and most controversial investment products to be offered to small investors," report the WSJ's Juliet Chung and Kirsten Grind. "The so-called funds 'sweep' includes examinations of large investment firms such as BlackRock Inc. and AQR Capital Management LLC but also smaller firms that previously didn't offer mutual funds, according to some of the people ... Alternative funds, or 'liquid alternative funds,' describe a class of mutual funds that employ hedge-fund-like strategies, including betting on some stocks and against others, trading futures contracts and using derivatives to increase leverage."

Thomson ReutersTraders work on the floor of the New York Stock ExchangeBy Ryan Vlastelica NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures rose on Wednesday amid a perceived  easing of tensions in both Ukraine and Iraq, which pushed investors to seek bargains. * Wall Street has struggled for direction of late, notching both steep losses and solid gains - often on low trading volume - with equities largely moving on the news flow from abroad.

WikipediaPacific Century Place MarunouchiTOKYO (Reuters) - A Goldman Sachs Group Inc unit is a final bidder for a Tokyo office tower in a deal that could fetch about 165 billion yen ($1.6 billion), said people familiar with the deal, which could be the biggest office property deal in six years. Secured Capital, part of Asian private equity firm PAG, is trying to sell the 32-storey Pacific Century Place Marunouchi, in a prime spot near the Tokyo railway station. It bought the property for about 144 billion yen in 2009. Investors are aggressively seeking properties as Tokyo prices are expected to continue a rebound they have seen under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's growth policies of massive monetary and fiscal stimulus. Among other recent deals, Japan's Orix Corp and New York investors Angelo Gordon &amp; Co are seeking around 40 billion yen for their stake in a Tokyo office building. Goldman Sachs Asset Management is competing against at least two other investors with similar bids, said the people with knowledge of the deal. The investors were screened in an initial bid and the sellers will award one of the final bidders exclusive rights to negotiate the deal. The other bidders could not immediately be confirmed. A Goldman Sachs spokeswoman declined to comment. Officials at Secured Capital could not be reached for comment. The bids represent the biggest deal for an office property in Japan since the global crisis of 2008, even though it looks set to fall short of the 180 billion yen that Secured Capital initially sought. Pacific Century Place Marunouchi, completed in 2001, was bought by K.K. daVinci Holdings in 2006 for 200 billion yen at a market peak. Shinsei Bank Ltd extended loans for the highly leveraged transaction and took control of the property when daVinci became unable to repay on time after Japan's real estate market crashed in the global financial crisis. Pacific Century is located in Tokyo's Chiyoda ward, where rents are the highest and vacancy rates remain the lowest in Tokyo.

Thomson ReutersA Telecom Italia antenna booster is seen in northern RomeROME (Reuters) - The head of Telecom Italia is set to meet Vivendi chairman Vincent Bollore on Wednesday or Thursday to discuss an offer for the French group's Brazilian broadband unit GVT, two sources with knowledge of the matter said. "Bollore and (Telecom Italia CEO Marco) Patuano will meet in Paris today or tomorrow to discuss the Telecom Italia offer for GVT though an offer won't be formalised before the Vivendi board meeting on August 28," one of the sources said. A second source said the meeting takes place on Wednesday. Telecom Italia and Vivendi declined to comment. French millionaire Bollore, a long-standing investor in Italy, is a leading shareholder of Mediobanca, the influential investment bank that has for long been at the heart of Italy’s high finance. Mediobanca used to control Telecom Italia along with Telefonica and other financial players. Sources told Reuters last week that Telecom Italia was in talks with Vivendi to buy GVT and beat a 6.7 billion euro ($8.9 billion) bid from Spanish rival Telefonica, which is also Telecom Italia's biggest investor. The sources said the plan, which could be finalised over the next three weeks, would involve an equity swap to allow Vivendi to acquire a stake in Telecom Italia. Patuano has not ruled out a possible merger between the Italian group's local wireless unit TIM Brasil and GVT but said he will not make any "crazy" acquisitions in Brazil. The Latin American country is a crucial market for both Telecom Italia and Telefonica and still has growth potential, in contrast to relatively saturated European markets. A tie-up between TIM Brasil and GVT would create a stronger competitor to Telefonica's local unit Vivo. If Telefonica's bid succeeds, TIM Brasil's position would be weakened because it would remain the only mobile operator in Brazil without a large broadband business. Italian newspaper Il Messaggero said on Wednesday that Patuano would meet Bollore shortly to discuss "an equity and industrial alliance" between TIM Brasil and GVT. Telefonica last week made an unexpected 6.7 billion euros bid for GVT in a deal that would allow Vivendi to acquire an 8.3 percent stake in Telecom Italia. Heavily indebted Telecom Italia, which is carrying out a series of asset disposals to fund investments, may have to launch a capital increase to buy GVT, analysts said. "Given Telefonica's 6.7 billion euro offer for GVT, we believe TI will likely need a sizeable capital increase to fund a competing offer," Citigroup said in a note.

Thomson ReutersFile photo of the logo of VolkswagenBEIJING (Reuters) - The European Union Chamber of Commerce in China on Wednesday expressed concern over a recent series of antitrust investigations, saying China was using strong-arm tactics and appeared to be unfairly targeting foreign firms. An array of industries have been coming under the spotlight as China intensifies efforts to bring companies into compliance with an anti-monopoly law enacted in 2008. The auto sector has been under particular scrutiny, and the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), China's state planner, has been investigating it amid accusations by state media that global car makers are overcharging consumers. European car brands including Volkswagen AG's Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz are scrambling to lower prices for new cars and spare parts in an effort to appease Chinese regulators who have accused some of them of anti-competitive behavior. The European Chamber said that while effective enforcement of the anti-monopoly law would help develop a "healthy market economy" in China, it was concerned about the way investigations were being carried out. "Inspections must not prejudge the outcome of the investigation and full rights of defense must be afforded to the companies in question. Disconcertingly, the European Chamber is not convinced that this has systematically been the case in China's recent investigations," it said in a statement. "The European Chamber has received numerous alarming anecdotal accounts from a number of sectors that administrative intimidation tactics are being used to impel companies to accept punishments and remedies without full hearings," it said. "Practices such as informing companies not to challenge the investigations, bring lawyers to hearings or involve their respective governments or chambers of commerce are contrary to best practices," it said. European business are also increasingly wondering whether foreign companies are being disproportionately targeted, said the chamber, which has more than 1,800 member companies in China. "In some of the industries under investigation, domestic companies have not been targeted for similar violations. Furthermore, in some cases that involve joint ventures, it has only been the foreign partner that has been named as being a party to the investigations," it said. The NDRC did not answer telephone calls seeking comment. Chinese authorities say the law is applied to both domestic and foreign firms, with the aim of protecting consumers. The NDRC has said it has targeted domestic telecoms companies, including China Unicom and China Telecom Corp, and domestic financial institutions for anti-trust practices. U.S. companies have also been caught up in the investigations, including software giant Microsoft Corp, and chipmaker Qualcomm Inc which faces the prospect of a $1 billion fine. Such investigations have rekindled concerns that the Chinese government may be using the anti-monopoly law to support domestic firms at the expense of foreign companies.

Thomson ReutersAn employee is seen behind a glass wall with the logo of Alibaba at the company's headquarters on the outskirts of Hangzhou, Zhejiang provinceBEIJING (Reuters) - Jack Ma, founder and executive chairman of Alibaba Group Holding, holds deep sway over executive and board appointments at China's biggest e-commerce company, and that influence is set to strengthen further at the firm, which is heading towards a New York IPO that is expected to raise more than $15 billion later this year. In Alibaba's latest filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), it said Ma this year initiated a bonus program that allowed senior executives and Alibaba staff to acquire share rights at an affiliated company he controls. Alibaba on Tuesday underscored the potential conflict of interest from Ma's role as Alibaba's executive chairman and as the controlling shareholder at the company which holds Alibaba's affiliated Alipay payment business - even as the company said it was forging a closer relationship with the unit. "If conflicts arise," Alibaba said in an amended SEC filing, "such conflicts may not be resolved in our favor." Companies routinely amend their filings ahead of an IPO. In Tuesday's filing, Alibaba expanded its "risk factors" comments, but it was not clear whether this reflected any concerns raised by the SEC or potential investors. Alibaba's CEO Jonathan Lu, chief people officer Lucy Peng, and chief risk officer Shao Xiaofeng, are among 20 senior executives who have benefited from the bonus program, taking share rights which provide the holder with the economic benefits of the stock, company registration documents show. All 20, along with Ma, are members of the Alibaba Partnership, the 27-member group which will have the exclusive right to nominate a majority of Alibaba's board of directors, documents show. A bonus scheme granting employees at a listed company shares in an unlisted affiliate doesn't raise any legal concerns, but it is unusual for a firm to allow an executive to independently determine compensation, corporate governance experts say. The scheme potentially further separates Alibaba investors from voting control of the company, said Charles Elson, director at the Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. "For investors, it's a troubling structure. Public shareholders are going to put up lots of capital, but get very little back in terms of control." The rewards program, which Ma intends to continue using, may also deepen the 49-year-old executive chairman's control of Alibaba's executive management, and allow him to further influence how the company's board is selected. "Alibaba is doing many things that go against what is considered best practice in corporate governance," said Paul Gillis, an accounting professor at Peking University's Guanghua School of Management. "These kinds of structures can be dangerous in a large organization because they lack transparency and may misalign the interests of shareholders and employees."     PAYMENT, FINANCIAL SERVICES Ma this year began distributing share rights for Zhejiang Alibaba E-Commerce (Small and Micro Financial Services Co), a Hangzhou-registered company that holds Alipay and other financial services licenses. Ma stripped Alipay from Alibaba four years ago in a controversial move that damaged relations with major shareholders, led by Yahoo Inc &lt;yhoo.o&gt;. Alibaba's 20 executives acquired about 42 percent of Small and Micro Financial Services' shareholding rights through participation in Hangzhou Junao Equity Investment Partnership, an entity registered late last year which is controlled by Ma through a separate unit, Hangzhou Yunbo Investment Consultancy Ltd. Alibaba said on Tuesday that Ma believes the equity-related awards tied company employees "to the success" of Small and Micro Financial Services, which has entered into a more far-reaching framework agreement with the e-commerce firm. As of March, the Alibaba executives agreed to pay 921.3 million yuan ($149 million) for the share rights, company registration documents show. The rest of Small and Micro Financial Services was recently transferred to Hangzhou Junhan Investment Partnership, another entity controlled by Ma, Alibaba said in its filings. In March, Ma also used Junhan to give similar share-based awards to most Alibaba employees, Alibaba said in a July SEC filing. Ma intends to "issue additional share-based awards" to Alibaba staff "from time to time in the future," it added. The Junhan share-based employee awards will be vested "upon the fulfillment of requisite service," Alibaba said. Similar awards by Junhan will be subject to the approval of the company's audit committee. The awards, to be settled in cash, are similar to share appreciation awards and are linked to the valuation of Small and Micro Financial Services. Junhan has the right to buy back the awards if the company should sell shares in a public offering. Ma's own stake in Small and Micro Financial Services would be "reduced over time" to equal his 8.9 percent shareholding in Alibaba Group, with the share reduction to take place over the next 3-5 years, Alibaba said on Tuesday. While Alibaba isn't obliged to pay for the awards, and the Alibaba founder pledged not to receive "any economic benefit" from the reduction in his shareholding in Small and Micro Financial Services, the company will record future related costs, it said. "Jack (Ma), through his role with us and his control over Junhan could be in a position to propose and promote further share-based grants that result in additional, and potentially significant, expenses to our company," Alibaba said in Tuesday's filing.   (Editing by Ian Geoghegan) FREE AppDownload
Bank of England / TwitterThe Bank of England will raise interest rates in "small, slow increases" Governor Mark Carney has said. Here's the key phrase from the BofE's statement today: Inflation is close to the [Monetary Policy Committee] MPC’s 2% target and is projected to remain close to the target in the period ahead.  As slack has been absorbed, financial market expectations of the date of the first Bank Rate rise have moved forward.  But when Bank Rate does begin to rise, the pace of rate increases is expected to be gradual, with rates probably remaining below average historical levels for some time. Bank of EnglandCarney as he delivered the news today.Here's Carney's prepared remarks: Unemployment has fallen sharply and is now expected to drop below 6% by the end of the year and to around 5.5% by the end of the forecast period - a marked reduction relative to our expectations in May. The MPC expects inflation to remain at, or slightly below, 2%, before reaching the target at the end of the forecast period. As I said in Glasgow recently, as the economy normalises, Bank Rate will need to start to rise in order to achieve the inflation target. The problem for observers is that Carney is trying to have it both ways. He is saying that rates will rise, but not giving a timetable, and leaving the door open for a continuation of the extended period in which rates have been set at near zero. Here's a key phrase from his remarks: But the MPC has no pre-set course. The path of Bank Rate will depend on how the expansion proceeds and how the inflation outlook evolves. The BofE also increased its forecast of economic growth in the U.K. from 3.4% to 3.5%. The FTSE 100 is flat on the news, immediately after the announcement. Oh dear — the man from The Guardian just asked Carney an insulting question, the FT notes: ... from Larry Elliot at the Guardian): Isn't it true that the Bank hasn't got a clue what's going on out there? And anyone planning to take out a mortgage based on your guidance would be foolish to do so? "Thank you Larry," replies Carney with a grin Carney was asked by Sky whether he was "slow boiling the inflation frog." The question amused Carney but he stuck to his guns: The BofE will keep it deliberately vague. Another reporter then accused Carney of being "clueless." (That seems like an unnecessarily rude way to describe the fact that it's genuinely difficult to balance fighting inflation with the need to not cripple the economy by making money more expensive to borrow.) Carney said the BofE will implement whatever it needs to "regardless of the outcome" of the Scottish vote for independence. Previously, the U.K. government had said Scotland will not be allowed to continue using the pound as its sovereign currency. Here's Carney's statement today: We'll implement whatever we're asked to implement. We also have responsibility for financial stability in the U.K. and we'll continue to discharge those responsibilities until they change ... regardless of the outcome of the vote on the 18th of September. The FT has  great live blog of the announcement here. It says: The MPC has revised up its expectation for near-term growth - it expects growth to slow a little later than it thought in May. The MPC also expects unemployment to fall faster than it thought in May, and inflation to remain around the 2 per cent target over the forecast period. ... The path of Bank rate will be gradual, Carney stresses. "Small, slow increases" could help mitigate the risk that higher borrowing costs would derail the economy. Carney also says that even if all the slack in the economy was eliminated overnight, interest rates would not need to be much higher than they are now - because of all the persistent headwinds facing the economy in the wake of the crisis. Here's HuffPo's Asa Bennett: BoE MPC's forecast for when interest rates will rise was an 'expectation, not a promise". Well that's clear then. The economy is growing in Britain, and unemployment is declining. But Germany may put a drag on the economy, according to City AM: Berenberg Bank’s economists have already cut their forecasts for the Eurozone, projecting just 0.1 per cent growth in each of the next two quarters. Saxo Bank’s Steen Jakobsen also expects just a 0.1 per cent boost or lower, calling the year a “total loss”. You can download the BofE's inflation report here. FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersAmazon CEO Bezos is silhouetted during a presentation of his company's new Fire smartphone in SeattleSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc unveiled a $10 credit-card reader and mobile app for brick-and-mortar businesses on Wednesday, marking the latest step by the U.S. online retailer to expand its presence in the physical world. The move pits Amazon against a slew of rivals, including startup Square, which popularized a payments dongle that allowed small- and mid-sized businesses like food trucks, coffee shops and personal trainers to quickly accept credit and debit cards. The new point-of-sale system, called Amazon Local Register, would give Amazon crucial data on how U.S. consumers shop offline. More than 90 percent of U.S. retail sales still take place in physical stores, according to U.S. government data. Amazon hopes to court small businesses in part by charging lower fees than Square and eBay Inc's &lt;ebay.o&gt; PayPal unit. Those who sign up for Amazon's program before Oct. 31 will be charged 1.75 percent for each card swiped until January 2016. For those who sign up after October, Amazon will take a 2.5 percent cut of each card swipe, still less than Square's 2.75 percent flat transaction rate and PayPal's 2.7 percent.

Thomson ReutersPeople cross a bridge at Pudong financial district in ShanghaiBEIJING (Reuters) - China's economy showed further signs of softening in July despite a burst of government stimulus measures, suggesting more policy support may be needed to keep growth on track as a property downturn worsens. Unexpectedly weak growth in investment, retail sales and  bank lending in July all pointed to growing vulnerabilities in the world's second-largest economy. The biggest surprise from Wednesday's data deluge came from credit and financing figures that showed the amount of cash flowing into the world's second-largest economy tumbled to a near six-year low in July of 273.1 billion yuan ($44.34 billion), about one seventh of that in June. The central bank downplayed the drop, saying that the plunge in lending was a natural pull-back after an unusual surge in June, while conceding loan demand was slowing. Analysts said the unusually large drop may also have come on the back of a crackdown on high-risk loans and commodity financing in the wake of a fraud scandal at the port of Qingdao. But the dour news rattled some economists, who worried that the numbers signaled not only weaker loan demand in the property sector but growing caution on the part of banks to lend in general as credit risks increase. The mood contrasted sharply with that in June, when data showed the economy appeared to be regaining traction after a weak start to the year. "The reading on investment, the most important driver of the economy, missed market expectations again," said Hu Yuexiao, an analyst at Shanghai Securities. "Add to that the remarkable decline in credit growth in the corporate sector and it could suggest an end to the economic rebound (seen) in the second quarter." Hu said he expected authorities to further loosen monetary policy with a possible interest rate cut, whilst trying to stoke investment growth by slashing red-tape and wooing private capital. Helped by a steady stream of government stimulus, China's economy rebounded slightly to 7.5 percent in the second quarter - in line with the government's full-year target - from an 18-month low of 7.4 percent in the first three months. But buffeted by a property downturn that has hurt domestic spending, the economy appears to be sputtering again. Questions about the durability of the economic recovery flared last week when surveys on the services sector showed unexpected weakness, linked largely to the housing market downturn.  PROPERTY DRAG Accounting for roughly 15 percent of China's economy, the housing sector has faltered this year as prices and sales turned south, leading many analysts to warn that it poses the biggest risk to broader growth. Wednesday's data showed the slowdown may have deepened. Housing sales skidded 16.3 percent in July compared with a year ago in terms of floor space, Reuters calculations showed, a sharp increase from June's 0.2 annual fall. New construction fell 12.8 percent in January-July as cash-strapped developers tried to clear huge inventories of unsold homes. But discounts and other sweeteners have failed to attract many buyers, who expect further price declines. While easier access to loans is seen as one key to preventing a sharp correction in the property market, a survey released by Standard Chartered last week indicated many developers were finding it tougher to access funding through banks or trust loans. They also said borrowing costs were rising, and most felt banks did not appear more willing to extend loans to first-time home buyers despite encouragement from the central bank. Analysts said the wobbly real estate market had dampened overall investment growth, which was up 17 percent in the first seven months compared with the year-ago period, a level unseen in over 12 years. "The sluggishness of the property market will continue to hang over the domestic economy," said Louis Kuijs, an economist at RBS. "We expect the government to continue taking and encouraging measures to support growth." Economists disagree on whether China will need to resort to more aggressive policy loosening measures, such as cutting interest rates or the reserve requirement ratio for banks to shore up growth. A Reuters poll last month showed analysts were split on whether China would cut the reserve requirement ratio this year, though half of those surveyed thought that a 50-basis-point reduction was possible before March. Analysts who oppose further policy loosening, including the International Monetary Fund, argue that China's economy is already awash in credit, and authorities must refrain from adding more cash to the system unless growth crumbles. To be sure, the latest data pointed to some pockets of resilience. Industrial output rose 9 percent in July from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said, slowing from June's 9.2 percent gain but in line with market expectations. Data last week showed exports grew nearly twice as much as expected, though imports unexpectedly fell, pointing to soft domestic demand. Retail sales, a key gauge of domestic consumption, rose 12.2 percent in July from a year earlier, slowing from June's 12.4 percent pace. "The activity figures are basically lower than market expectations, especially the investment data, which is mainly due to the weak showing in the property market," said Zhou Hao, an economist at ANZ in Shanghai. "I would say the government will have to further relax policies to deliver an annual growth rate of 7.5 percent."  (Reporting by China economics team; Editing by Kim Coghill) FREE AppDownload

Thomson ReutersA huge euro logo is pictured past next to headquarters of ECB in FrankfurtBRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone industrial production contracted unexpectedly for a second month in a row in June, further denting hopes of a stronger recovery as the bloc starts to take the hit from conflict in Iraq, Ukraine and Gaza, data showed on Wednesday. Output at factory gates single currency bloc fell 0.3 percent on the month in June after a 1.1 percent drop in May, against market expectations of a 0.3 percent rise. When compared with the same period of last year, production was flat, following an upwardly revised 0.6 percent rise in May, while economists polled by Reuters expected a 0.1 percent annual increase in June. It was the lowest annual reading since August 2013. The monthly drop was due mainly to a 1.9 percent drop in production of non-durable consumer goods, down for a second consecutive month and 0.7 percent fall in energy production, which was up in the previous three months. Economic recovery in the 9.6 trillion euro economy is struggling to gain momentum a year after exiting a recession, throttled by combination of high unemployment, sluggish reform the fallout from conflict in Ukraine, Gaza and Iraq. The latest sign of just how fragile the euro zone's economic rebound remains came from Germany on Tuesday where investor sentiment nosedived to its lowest since December 2012 on what impact European sanctions against Russia will have. Eurostat will publish the second quarter economic growth flash estimate on Thursday. Economists surveyed by Reuters expected an expansion of 0.2 percent on the quarter in the three months to June, the same pace as seen in the first quarter. While the bloc's three largest economies saw production rising on the month in June, Germany's industrial output fell 0.4 percent year-on-year in June in the country's first annual drop since July 2013. The bloc's No. 2 economy, France, saw flat output on the year in June, its best performance since December, and Italy's industrial production rose by 0.4 percent in June after a 1.7 percent decline in May. Much stronger expansion, a scenario not seen as likely any time soon, is needed to spur job creation and rejuvenate countries choked by austerity and the legacy of recession.   (Editing by Louise Ireland) FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersGeneral view of U.S. Federal Reserve building in Washington(Reuters) - Banks are lobbying U.S. policy makers for a delay of up to seven years from a provision requiring them to sell investments in private-equity and venture-capital funds, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Bank officials, trade groups and lawmakers are quietly pressing the Federal Reserve for a multiyear delay of the rule that limits their investments in private-equity and venture-capital funds, the Journal said. (http://on.wsj.com/1l12Pi8) The "Volcker rule," part of the Dodd-Frank law, restricts banks' ownership stake in hedge funds and private equity funds. The rule prohibits banks from making speculative bets with their own money. A delay of the rule would affect large banks such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc &lt;gs.n&gt;, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co &lt;jpm.n&gt; and Morgan Stanley &lt;ms.n&gt;, the Journal said. The private equity business has become less appealing in general to banks because of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law. The Volcker rule, expected to be implemented in a few years, prohibits banks from investing in any fund they do not manage. Since the Volcker Rule was adopted, some banks have already made changes. The Federal Reserve could not be reached for comment outside of business hours. JPMorgan on Monday spun off its last remaining private equity business, One Equity Partners, and sold almost half of its stake in the portfolio. Morgan Stanley in 2011 spun off most of its ownership in the $4.5 billion hedge fund FrontPoint Partners. Representatives from Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs also could not be reached outside of their business hours.

AP Photo/Harold FilanLegendary actress Lauren Bacall died at age 89. Bacall is pictured here with husband Humphrey Bogart at the Hollywood premiere of "The Desperate Hour" on Oct. 12, 1955.Good morning! Here's what people will be chatting about on Wednesday.  1. The international community is increasing efforts to help thousands of Yazidi refugees trapped on Mount Sinjar in Iraq by ISIS militants. The U.S. sent more than 100 military advisers to northern Iraq on Tuesday, while Britain has dispatched Chinook helicopters to airlift some refugees.  2. American actress Lauren Bacall died Tuesday at age 89. Bacall got her breakout role at age 19 in the 1944 film "To Have and Have Not," starring alongside legendary actor Humphrey Bogart, whom she later married.  3. Canada said it would donate around 1,000 doses of an experimental Ebola vaccine to the World Health Organization. This comes after the health agency said it was ethical to offer "unproven interventions" as "potential treatment or prevention" of the Ebola virus outbreak. 4. The Ukraine government said it may block a Russian convoy of trucks carrying humanitarian aid to the country's eastern region."We will not allow any escort by the emergencies ministry of Russia or by the military (onto Ukrainian territory)," Ukraine deputy head Valery Chaly said, according to Reuters. "Everything will be under the control of the Ukrainian side," he added.  5. Police said they will not release the name of the officer who shot and killed an unarmed teen in a suburb of St. Louis because of concers for the officer's safety. Three nights of violent protests and looting in Ferguson, Missouri, have followed the fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown.  6. The Japanese economy shrank 6.8% in the second quarter, the sharpest fall since the 2011 tsunami. The GDP decline is the result of a national sales tax that reduced consumer spending.  7.

Thomson ReutersPeople cross a bridge at Pudong financial district in ShanghaiBEIJING (Reuters) - The amount of money flowing into China's economy slowed to the lowest level in nearly six years in July, adding to fears that a sustained recovery may be at risk in the second half of the year despite government efforts to shore up growth. Both the central bank and economists had expected some payback in July after unexpectedly strong financing data in June, but new loans and money supply growth were far below economists' expectations. China's total social financing (TSF) aggregate, a broad measure of liquidity in the economy, fell to 273.1 billion yuan ($44.34 billion) in July, about one seventh of that in June and the lowest monthly reading since October 2008 in the depths of the global financial crisis. The People's Bank of China took the unusual step of issuing a statement immediately after the data, reassuring markets that credit and financing growth was still reasonable and that it had not changed its monetary policy. Still, it conceded the slowing economy, and in particular the cooling property market, were dampening loan demand and highlighted the risks of pumping too much money into a softening economy too quickly, citing the growing number of bad loans. Non-performing loans have now risen for 11 straight quarters, the central bank's statement said. "It's surprising. On the face of it, we've not observed any tightening of monetary conditions by policymakers," said Louis Kuijs, an economist at Royal Bank of Scotland in Hong Kong. "I don't know if this has anything to do with disagreements between policymakers. In its recent monetary policy report, the central bank warned of continued risks in fast credit lending." Chinese banks made 385.2 billion yuan ($62.53 billion) worth of new yuan loans in July, down sharply from 1.08 trillion yuan in June and well below expectations of 727.5 billion yuan, central bank data showed on Wednesday. The People's Bank of China said in its second quarter policy report earlier this month that it will maintain reasonable growth in credit and social financing and fine-tune its monetary policy in a timely way. But it also sounded a cautious note by saying that bank credit is already too large and it needs to be mindful of inflationary risks. That echoed analysts' concerns about how much of June's loan surge was going into real economic activity and how much may be going into speculative activities. Broad M2 money supply rose 13.5 percent last month from a year earlier, the People's Bank of China said in a statement on its website, www.pbc.gov.cn, lower than the forecast 14.4 percent rise. Outstanding yuan loans grew 13.4 percent from a year earlier versus forecasts for growth of 14.0 percent. Beijing stepped up efforts to re-energize China's economy in June, pumping more money into the system and pressing banks to extend more loans. Those steps and other stimulus measures earlier in the year appear to have offset the drag from a weakening property sector and sluggish exports, but analysts say more support may be needed to sustain a recovery. China's main stock index, the Shanghai Composite Index &lt;.SSEC&gt;, reversed early gains and fell 0.8 percent after the credit data was released. "Many investors have been waiting for July's economic data to decide their investment strategy after the market's recent gains," said Xiao Shijun, analyst at Guodu Securities in Beijing. "Now that the credit data lagged far behind market expectations, that is really a hit at market sentiment." Data on industrial output, retail sales and investment will be released later in the day. Investors will be looking for signs of whether softness in the property market is spreading into the rest of the economy, which would pour cold water on hopes that the economy was slowly regaining traction. Recent factory surveys suggested China's economy has regained momentum due largely to a spate of government measures, but weakness in imports and the services sector have raised questions about whether authorities need to do more to sustain activity. The surprising and sudden weakness recently seen in services appeared linked to the cooling property market, which may be facing a prolonged slump that could hurt related businesses and dampen consumer confidence. After the economy got off to a rocky start early in the year, Chinese authorities have rolled out a series of policy measures such as increasing bank lending, easing controls in the property market, and accelerating the construction of some infrastructure projects. A growing number of local governments have also relaxed restrictions on home purchases in a bid to cushion the impact of the faltering property market. But Chinese leaders have vowed not to unleash a massive aid package like the one adopted in 2008/2009 to shield the economy from the global financial crisis. That plan also fueled inflationary pressures and left some municipal governments loaded with debt. Fitch Ratings warned last week that the loosening of restrictions on property purchases and the easing of monetary policies in China may unintentionally increase speculation on residential property, as was seen in 2009. Stimulus measures helped lift China's economic growth to 7.5 percent in the second quarter, from an 18-month low of 7.4 percent in the first quarter of this year. However, some experts including the International Monetary Fund have urged China to refrain from further stimulus measures and concentrate instead on reforming the world's second-biggest economy.   (Reporting By Xiaoyi Shao; Editing by Kim Coghill) FREE AppDownload
