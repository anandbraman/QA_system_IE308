Thomson ReutersA guest looks at a HTC desire eye smartphone after its launch in New YorkNEW YORK (Reuters) - HTC Corp  will not need to tap the capital markets in 2015 or even beyond, the Taiwanese smartphone maker's chief financial officer told Reuters on Wednesday, citing its lack of debt, $1.7 billion in cash and the ability to fund itself. “I don’t think we need to worry about it at all," Chialin Chang said in an interview on the sidelines of the company's launch of a new smartphone and miniature connected camera. "We’re not going to the capital markets for funding. We can self-fund ourselves very sufficiently.” HTC's phones have often struggled to translate positive early reviews into strong sales and the Taipei-based former contract manufacturer has found it difficult to build its own identity in an increasingly competitive space. The company last week reported better-than-forecast third-quarter profit, but mainly thanks to cost cuts rather than improved sales. Chang said the company now has a strong portfolio of phones at prices that will attract buyers in both developed markets and emerging ones. "I think with a more robust portfolio we're going to be able to show that we can grow again," he said. "Hopefully people will feel in the next earnings call with the guidance, we can get the momentum back." He also said the company has no interest in being acquired and that it can "best deliver shareholder value on our own, independently." Like other, larger mobile phone makers such as Apple Inc  and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd , HTC is trying to diversify into other "connected" devices to find new growth outside an increasingly commoditized space, though he said phones remained the company's "key bread and butter." Chang declined to comment on reports that Google Inc has selected HTC to make its upcoming 9-inch (23-cm) tablet or that the two companies could collaborate on a "smart watch" although he acknowledged that the company was working on other "smart devices." The "Re" camera, which can be controlled remotely from an Android or Apple phone, represents one effort to branch out beyond phones. Given that the cylinder-shaped device is waterproof and is highly portable, it could be seen as a potential competitor to GoPro Inc  cameras. Chang said that was the wrong comparison since GoPro cameras are specifically aimed at "extreme" sports while the Re, which will sell for $199 in the United States, is aimed at everyday use. He refused to be drawn on whether the Re camera, or the Desire EYE mobile phone, which features 13 megapixel front and rear cameras, would contribute more to the company's bottom line, or provide revenue targets for either product.

Goldman SachsHistorically, there's been a pretty consistent correlation between oil prices and the US dollar. When the dollar strengthened, oil prices would fall — and vice versa. For the longest time, this relationship has been explained by the huge flow of US oil imports. However, a new report by Goldman Sachs's Jeffrey Currie says that rationale has broken down in the wake of the American shale revolution. "In 2008 ... the US was importing on a net basis nearly 12 million [barrels per day] of oil and products," Currie writes. "Owing to shale technology, today that number is now less than 5 million b/d. And subtracting out Canada and Mexico, the number drops to 2.4 million b/d. In other words, net imports are over 60% lower than in 2008." This has "significantly reduced the correlation between commodities and the US dollar," he writes. In the past, Currie writes, investors believed that the "primary mechanism for the correlation" between oil prices and the dollar was the large US petroleum current account deficit. "From the early 2000's to the global financial crisis, increasing oil imports saw a widening US current account deficit, which put depreciation pressure on the dollar (appreciation pressure on oil producers currencies), which in turn put further widening pressure on the current account deficit (for any given volume of imports), causing additional dollar weakness," Currie writes. By 2008, oil reached $147 per barrel and the US dollar was at its weakest point versus the Euro at 1.6. At the time, the US was importing on a net basis approximately 12 million barrels per day of oil and products. REUTERS/Harrison McClaryA piece of North Dakota shale.Today, the number of imports has dropped to around 5 million. If you take out Canada and Mexico, that number falls further to 2.4 million — a stark difference from 2008's 12 million. Overall, oil imports are down more than 60% since 2008. Imports have dropped because the US is now using hydraulic fracturing to extract oil from its massive shale basins, creating more supply.  And it's during this same 2008 - 2014 time period that there's been a huge reduction in correlation between oil prices and the US dollar, according to Currie. "Along with the post-crisis financial market normalization, [the drop in oil imports] has dramatically reduced the correlation between oil and the USD, to around 0% (i.e. uncorrelated) today from historical highs near 60% in 2008/2009," Currie writes. Thus, according to this analysis, although oil prices have recently dropped as the dollar has surged, one trend doesn't explain the other. FREE AppDownload
Alcoa on Wednesday reported third quarter earnings and revenue that beat expectations. The aluminum giant reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.31 on revenue of $6.2 billion, and the company also reaffirmed its 2014 expectations for global aluminum demand growth of 7%.  Along with its third quarter earnings call, the company published a presentation giving an update on its own businesses, but also the global economy.  Overall, demand remains strong for Alcoa's products, but in keeping with what recent economic data has shown, the company has seen weakness in some of its business units in Europe. In the EU, heavy truck orders down are 4% year-to-date in the EU, and weakness continuing in the EU's building and construction segment, the company said. Here are four slides from Alcoa's presentation that give a great overview of how one of the world's biggest aluminum suppliers sees the current global economic situation.  Alcoa Alcoa Alcoa Alcoa
ZillowThe exterior of Alan Wilzig's $43.5 million former Tribeca condo.Alan Wilzig, a real-life inspiration for a character in Martin Scorsese’s “The Wolf of Wall Street,” is selling his Tribeca condo for $43.5 million without a broker, The Real Deal reports. The entrepreneur and semi-professional race car driver posted the home on Zillow.com as well as Facebook.  “Feel free to share this with your luxury real estate friends for anyone interested in a Manhattan super-residence,” Wilzig posted on his Facebook account, according to The Real Deal. “All brokers protected. I have no problem paying or sharing in paying a commission(s) – but I’m not willing at the present time to grant an exclusive with any one broker or firm. (Especially since a dozen of my good friends are all NYC brokers.)”  The 7,500-square-foot townhouse at 3 Hubert Street has a 2,500-square-foot roof deck, backyard, six bedrooms, and an attached garage where Wilzig currently stores his insane amount of motorcycle memorabilia. It also has bulletproof windows and a lighting system that would give Miami clubs a run for their money. In the Scorsese film, Wilzig inspired the character at the pool party scene who introduced Leonardo Di Caprio’s character to his future wife. Wilzig originally took issue with his portrayal, lamenting that his red Ferrari Testarossa was left out of the scene. An earlier version of this post said Wilzig had sold his home. The post has been corrected.
Microsoft Since naming Satya Nadella as CEO, Bill Gates spends a third of his time working at Microsoft, he told Vanity Fair's Bethany McLean. That's a surprisingly big chunk of time and more than most people realize. When Nadella became CEO, Gates gave up the Microsoft chairman job and took on the vague title of "Founder and Technology Advisor." That made it sound like he was practically dusting his hands of Microsoft. During the CEO search, Gates had repeatedly told people that he would not, under any circumstances, come back as CEO. And for a decade he's been selling off his Microsoft shares. He once had a 45% stake of Microsoft, or 1 billion shares. He's down to just under 300 million shares, less than a 4% stake and is no longer the company's biggest shareholder. Former CEO Steve Ballmer (with 333 million shares) is. If Gates continues selling his Microsoft stock at this rate, he'll be out of Microsoft entirely by the end of the decade. But, with a new CEO of his own choosing, his attention to the company has returned in force. When Microsoft announced Gates' new role, it said that Gates would "devote more time to the company, supporting Nadella in shaping technology and product direction." That turned out to be very true. But it also might turn out to be a big mistake. The same one Gates made with Ballmer. Gates gave up the CEO title in 2000, (in the midst of the company's anti-trust litigation with the Justice Department), but he actually didn't leave his full-time job at Microsoft for another eight years. He became "Chief Software Architect" until 2008. During those eight years, Gates pretty famously, and regularly, undermined Ballmer. Ballmer told Vanity Fair, "I didn’t feel completely in charge until Bill left [entirely in 2008]. ... He didn’t know how to let me be CEO, and I didn’t know how to do it." Ballmer and Gates had epic fights during that time, especially the first year. When engineers grew frustrated with Ballmer, they would go to Gates, McLean reports. Employees say it was like living with a mom and a dad and not knowing who was in charge. Gates told McLean he won't make the same mistake with Nadella. If the two of them disagree, “Satya runs the company, so he gets to decide,” Gates says, admitting that as a part-time Microsoftie, he may “not have the full picture. So I get to give input. And if I say to Satya, ‘Hey, this project needs 10 or 15 people, 'I’ll bet I’ll get it, but it’s up to him.” For his part, Nadella, who is more tactful than the hard-charging Ballmer, notes that he's been at Microsoft for 23 years, including those "mom-and-dad" years. "The thing you’ve got to remember is I grew up in a Microsoft where Bill and Steve were there," Nadella told McLean. "If there’s anything that I know it’s how to get stuff done with Bill around." But given Gates' clout in the world, the tech industry, and, especially, at Microsoft, you have to wonder: As Nadella's term proceeds and he wants (or needs) to defy Gates, will that really be possible?

Others have just started saving late. Charles Schwab's Rande Spiegelman recommends several strategies in order to catch up and make the most of what investors have. He writes that investors should save more now and spend less — "it's as simple as it is unpopular." Additionally, he suggests that investors should spend less money during retirement, especially if the mortgage is paid off and the "kids don't move back." Investors should also consider retiring later and even working part-time after retirement age. Finally, soon-to-be retirees can max out their 401(k) or other employer retirement plans, and contribute to a deductible traditional IRA or a Roth IRA if they are eligible.  Lawyers: The Finra Arbitration Panels Lack Diversity (The Wall Street Journal) The Finra arbitration panels lack diversity, according to lawyers who represent investors in disputes with their brokers. Unfortunately, that could be bad news for investors because these homogeneous arbitration panels can lead to one-sided rulings. The average age of arbiters is 67. 40% are over the age of 70 and 17% are older than 80. Plus, approximately 80% of the arbiters are men. "A study of the roster of arbiters showed they were also chosen from too narrow a group of professionals, such as lawyers, and had a 'socioeconomic status that put them out of touch with the average investor,'" according to the The Public Investors Arbitration Bar Association. There Is A Growing Divergence Between Market Sectors (BlackRock Blog) Different market segments respond differently to changes in monetary policy. Those that are more affected by monetary policy changes have been suffering recently.  And "their performance is likely to continue to diverge from less impacted segments," writes BlackRock's Russ Koesterich. Generally, it's the small-cap valuations that are more sensitive to monetary changes than the large-cap valuations. This trend continued last week when US large caps never dipped down more than 5% from their highs. On the flip side, US small caps got into "correction territory," meaning that they declined by at least 10%. Advisors Are Turning Their Backs On Alternatives (Wealth Management.com) When the financial crisis hit, investors turned to liquid alternative funds — they wanted to have greater portfolio diversification and lower volatility. But now, investors are starting to consider other options.  "Some advisors may have become disillusioned with how alternative investments perform in a bull market as investors clamor for performance over low-volatility portfolios," reports Diana Britton. “2013 was definitely a year where the S&amp;P 500 did absolutely phenomenal, and liquid alternatives obviously lagged as they should in any extreme bull market,” said Josh Charney, alternative investments analyst at Morningstar. Advisors Need To Market To The Next Generation (Advisor Perspectives)  Marketing to the next generation is "high priority" for financial advisors, according to Bob Veres. "If you want your firm to survive long-term, it will need to have a healthy, diversified portfolio of clients," he adds. "When Accredited Investors in Minneapolis recently projected its AUM growth over the next 10 years, the conclusions were disturbing: the client base was aging, and based on who the firm was attracting, a greater percentage of the firm’s clients would be retired each year.  AUM growth would slow, then gradually contract, then contract rather quickly 10 years out," writes Veres. There are two things that advisory firms can do. First, they should hire younger advisors, or give more responsibilities to young staffers. And second, they should loosen up the client minimum.

REUTERS/Thomas Peter The stock market violently reversed its slide Wednesday, with the Dow gaining over 270 points, and the NASDAQ rallying over 2%. The event that made stocks take off like a rocket was the Fed minutes that came out at 2 p.m. ET. The minutes — which reflect the nature of the conversation at the Fed's last meeting — contained two critical lines. Here they are: — Some participants expressed concern that the persistent shortfall of economic growth and inflation in the euro area could lead to a further appreciation of the dollar and have adverse effects on the US external sector. — At the same time, a couple of participants pointed out that the appreciation of the dollar might also tend to slow the gradual increase in inflation toward the FOMC's 2% goal. In recent days we've been writing a lot about how the market is perceiving monetary policy to be tightening significantly. Short-term interest rates have been on the rise, inflation expectations are falling, and the dollar has been surging. With those two lines, the Fed has explicitly acknowledged what the market is concerned about, that policy is tightening and that inflation growth may be depressed. And with that acknowledgment, stocks surged. FREE AppDownload

Chris Hondros/GettyGoldman Sachs: Where the elite go to get paid.The investment bank Goldman Sachs is one of the most elite institutions on earth.  And most reviled. "'I'm going to Goldman,' is still about as close as it gets in the real world to 'I'm going to Harvard,'" said Michael Lewis, the firebrand financial writer.  The prestige comes with outrageous dollar signs — think "better than half a million dollars in annual compensation, per worker," if you take Businessweek's word for it.  Still, what do you earn if you're not at the top of the Goldman pile? If you're in the middle? Or even at the bottom? With those queries in mind, we sifted through Glassdoor's generous list of collected salaries to provide a glimpse into the pay for Goldman's 32,000 employees. One caveat: this list does not include bonuses, which are notoriously high on Wall Street. In the case of Goldman, the averages range from $8,630 for an operations analyst to $90,512 for a vice president to $8.25 million for a top trader.  According to Glassdoor, here are the average salaries for 15 positions at Goldman Sachs, in ascending order:  FREE AppDownload

Reuters Stocks rallied in a big way after the minutes from the latest Federal Reserve monetary policy meeting showed that the Fed remains particularly cautious about raising interest rates in the face of a strengthening US dollar and a slowing global economy. First, the scoreboard: And now the top stories on Wednesday: 1. The biggest story Wednesday was the release of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's September monetary-policy meeting. The minutes were interpreted as "dovish" by the market, essentially meaning that the market now expects the Fed to wait longer than it expected to raise interest rates after the end of its current quantitative-easing program, which is set to end this month. The minutes also showed a number of FOMC members were concerned about a strengthening US dollar and a slowing global economy. FOMC members also indicated that they want to eventually clarify that their forward guidance, or projections about when it might raise interest rates, will be data-dependent.  2. Aluminum giant Alcoa was scheduled to report third-quarter earnings after the market close on Wednesday, marking the unofficial start of the third-quarter corporate-earnings season.

ReutersNordstrom is one of the best investments in retail.Nordstrom is outperforming every other retail company.   The company's shares have gained 110% in five years. The company is well-positioned to continue that success in the future, according to a recent report by Deutsche Bank.  The department store has focused on a few aspects of the business to stand out.  Here's how Nordstrom is beating retailers from Macy's to T.J. Maxx.  "Throughout their history, they have consistently provided some of the best service in the industry," said Robin Lewis, CEO of The Robin Report and co-author with Michael Dart, of The New Rules of Retail – Competing in the World’s Toughest Marketplace.  Nordstrom is choosy about hiring "nice, capable people," according to Forbes.  Customers love the return policy: Nordstrom will take back any merchandise people bring back, no questions asked.  "The top-notch customer service is a big part of Nordstrom's long-term success," Lewis said.  Yahoo! Finance.The company's share price over the past five years Nordstrom Rack is a huge cash machine for the company, Edward Hertzman, founder and Publisher of retail publication Sourcing Journal, told Business Insider.  There is only a 10-20% overlap between Nordstrom Rack customers and the high-end department store, meaning that plenty of people are still paying full-price too. "The outlets have given them exposure to a completely different customer who is all about value," Hertzman said.  Nordstrom has opened more than 70 Rack locations since 2010, and has plans to build dozens more.  Associated PressA shopper checks a shoe as she walks down an aisle in a Nordstrom rack in Chicago Nordstrom has solved one of the biggest problems facing retailers: reaching millennial customers, Lewis said.  "The outlet business gives Nordstrom exposure to young customers who are seeking a deal and otherwise wouldn't be shopping there," he said. "The company believes that the younger customer will migrate into the full-line stores as they grow older." While Lewis believes there is a risk of the outlet business diluting the brand's image, he says that brands like Nordstrom that offer a variety of brands are less at-risk than name brands like Michael Kors.  "They have a breadth of brands, so having outlets might not tarnish the nameplate," he said.  NordstromNordstrom's omnichannel strategy helps it resonate with young customers. Nordstrom is determined to be the world's top omnichannel retailer. "This company is at the forefront of e-commerce and omnichannel retail," Lewis said.  Nordstrom recently made it possible to instantly buy the items featured on Instagram.  Workers also merchandise stores using input from its Pinterest page. Items that are popular on the social media site are featured more prominently on the sales floor.  Nordstrom has also aggressively invested in e-commerce, investing in men's brands Bonobos and Trunk Club and its own flash-sale site, Hautelook.

Spencer Platt/Getty ImagesFacebook's shareholders could have benefited from this information earlier this year.Want to reduce tax on your investment income? Avoid sales of appreciated stocks held less than a year. Here’s how it might have helped some disappointed Facebook shareholders earlier this year. First, the rules: Capital gains on the sale of stocks held for more than a year are taxed at a lower, long-term capital gains rate than gains on the sale of stocks held a year or less. By waiting to sell a position at a gain until it has been held for more than a year, a top-bracket taxpayer can reduce the tax bite from 43.4% to 23.8%. Investors in lower tax brackets who wait sometimes can entirely eliminate the tax on a capital gain. The benefit of waiting to sell can be large, even if the stock declines significantly while you’re waiting. Let’s say an investor in the top tax-bracket bought Facebook shares near its all-time low on March 27, 2013, for $25 a share, and almost a year later, still held the stock. Her gain would be huge. At its 52-week high, on March 11, 2014, Facebook was trading for $72.59, almost three times its all-time low. That might have made it tempting to sell—but there were still more than two weeks to go until the gains realized on the holding would become subject to long-term, rather than short-term, capital gains tax. If the investor sold at the high, she would realize a sale price of $72.59 but would owe 43.4% tax on a $47.59 short-term gain. A tax bill of over $20 would net her only $51.94 per share. If she held onto the stock for a few weeks longer, she might lose some of the embedded gain—but she would get much more favorable tax treatment of the gain. Even if the stock dropped 15%, she would garner greater after-tax proceeds by waiting for the stock to be subject to long-term capital gains tax than by selling at the high. Assuming that the investor sold the position at the opening price on the day it became subject to long-term capital-gains taxation (March 28, 2014), she would realize a sale price of $61.34, about $11 below the high. But by reducing her tax to the long-term capital gains tax rate, she would net $52.69, or 1.4% more than if she sold at the top. AllianceBernstein Of course, the opposite could have occurred. The position could have increased in value while she held the stock for long-term-gain treatment, so that she could have saved in taxes and earned a higher gross return. As the Facebook example shows, it’s not what you receive that matters, but what you get to keep. Timing transactions may sound easy, but it can be complicated, particularly for investors with large, diversified portfolios divided among multiple accounts.

A report from the Brookings Institute showed that fiscal policies that have throttled back government spending have been a drag on economic growth since 2011.  6. Activist hedge fund investor Carl Icahn tweeted that he would be sending an "interesting" open letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook on Thursday. Icahn added that he would appear on CNBC on Thursday afternoon to discuss the letter. In the past, Icahn has urged Apple to increase its shareholder buyback as a way to return cash to shareholders.  7. Shares of Sears Holdings lost about 4% on Wednesday after a report from Bloomberg said that a "medium-sized" vendor had halted shipments to the retailer. Sears later responded to the report, which it called "misleading," and said that it continues to meet all of its obligations and that is has "significant financial flexibility."  8. GoPro shares fell more than 4% after two analysts issued cautious commentary on the stock. Analysts at Barclays said that while they do not expect the company's sales to slow, the end of the lock-up period that prevents company insiders from selling stock after the IPO could weigh on share prices later this year. Analysts at Piper Jaffray wrote that the stock's "current valuation leaves little room for additional upside."  Don't Miss: All of A Sudden, Bill Ackman's Takeover Target Is Giving Him A Serious Run For His Money » FREE AppDownload
Emanuel LeutzeThe Fed has released the minutes from its latest policy meeting, which show that officials are concerned about a weakening global outlook and the surprise strength of the US dollar. Markets rallied to highs of the day as investors interpreted the Fed's stance as indicating a dovish bias. Basically, this means that market expects the Fed will wait longer than currently expected to raise its benchmark interest rate, which is currently pegged at 0%-0.25%.  Following the release, the Dow was up as much as 215 points. The Minutes showed that Fed officials were concerned that the US dollar could strengthen further, which could hurt certain parts of the economy and slow inflation.  The Fed also discussed that its current inflation forecast is more aggressive than what Wall Street is forecasting, with a number of Fed participants indicating that they are worried that a change in its forward guidance would bring about tighter financial conditions. Additionally, the minutes showed that most Fed participants want to eventually clarify that its forward guidance is data dependent. At its last monetary policy meeting, the Fed kept language indicating that "considerable time" would elapse between the end of its QE program and its first interest rate hike; QE is set to end this month. Other Fed officials noted that they would prefer to err on the side of patience in normalizing monetary policy (i.e., raising interest rates), while some officials continued to see "significant underutilization of labor market resources." Here are the complete minutes from the Fed: A meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee was held in the offices of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, September 16, 2014, at 11:00 a.m. and continued on Wednesday, September 17, 2014, at 9:00 a.m. PRESENT: Janet L.

The deputy manager reported on the System open market operations conducted during the period since the Committee met on July 29-30, 2014, summarized plans for additional test operations of the Term Deposit Facility, and described the results from the fixed-rate overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) operational exercise. The deputy manager also outlined a proposal for changes to the ongoing ON RRP exercise to test possible design features that could allow an ON RRP facility to serve as an effective supplementary tool during policy normalization while also mitigating the potential for unintended effects in financial markets. Participants discussed the proposed changes in the ON RRP exercise, including raising the counterparty-specific limit from $10 billion to $30 billion, limiting the overall size of each operation to $300 billion, and introducing an auction process that would be used to determine the interest rate on such operations and allocate take-up if the sum of bids exceeded the overall limit. Testing these design features was generally seen as furthering the Committee's understanding of how an ON RRP facility might be structured to best balance its objectives of supporting monetary control and of limiting the Federal Reserve's role in financial intermediation as well as reducing potential financial stability risks the facility might pose during periods of stress. Participants also discussed other tests that could be incorporated in the exercise at a later date, including a daily time-varying cap along with the overall limit on the size of ON RRP operations, small variations in the offered rate on ON RRP operations, and moderate increases and decreases in the overall size limit. A number of participants expressed concern that these tests could be misunderstood as providing a signal of the Committee's intentions regarding the parameters of the ON RRP program that will be implemented when normalization begins; they wanted to emphasize that the tests are intended to provide additional information to guide the Committee's decisions. Participants agreed to consider potential additional revisions to the ON RRP exercise at future FOMC meetings. Following the discussion, the Committee unanimously approved the following resolution: By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Open Market Desk's domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System's account over the intermeeting period. Monetary Policy NormalizationMeeting participants considered publication of a summary statement of their monetary policy normalization principles and plans based on the discussions at recent Committee meetings. Participants agreed that it was appropriate at this time to provide additional information regarding their approach to normalization. The proposed statement was seen as a concise summary of participants' views that would help the public understand the steps that the Committee plans to take when the time comes to begin the normalization process and that would convey the Committee's confidence in its plans. However, it was emphasized that the Committee would need to be flexible and pragmatic during normalization, adjusting the details of its approach, if necessary, in light of changing conditions. Regarding the specific points in the proposed statement, a couple of participants expressed their preference that the principles make greater allowance for sales of agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) over the next few years in order to normalize the size and composition of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet more quickly and to limit distortions in the allocation of credit that they believed were associated with the Federal Reserve's holdings of agency MBS. In addition, a few participants noted that they would have preferred that the principles point to an earlier end to the reinvestment of repayments of principal on securities held in the SOMA portfolio. At the end of the discussion, all but one participant could support the publication of the following statement after the meeting: The Board meeting concluded at the end of the discussion of policy normalization principles and plans. Staff Review of the Economic SituationThe information reviewed for the September 16-17 meeting suggested that economic activity was expanding at a moderate pace in the third quarter. Labor market conditions improved a little further, although the unemployment rate was essentially unchanged over the intermeeting period. Consumer price inflation was running below the FOMC's longer-run objective of 2 percent, but measures of longer-run inflation expectations remained stable. Total nonfarm payroll employment increased in July and August but at a slower pace than in the first half of the year. The unemployment rate was 6.1 percent in August, the same as in June, and the labor force participation rate and the employment-to-population ratio also were unchanged since that time. Both the share of workers employed part time for economic reasons and the rate of long-duration unemployment declined a little over the past two months. Other recent indicators generally pointed to ongoing improvement in labor market conditions: Although some measures of household expectations of the labor market situation deteriorated somewhat, the rates of job openings and of gross private-sector hiring moved up, initial claims for unemployment insurance were essentially flat at a relatively low level, and some readings on firms' hiring plans improved. On balance, industrial production edged up over July and August, and the rate of manufacturing capacity utilization was unchanged. Automakers' schedules indicated that the pace of motor vehicle assemblies would decline slightly in the fourth quarter, but broader indicators of manufacturing production, such as the readings on new orders from the national and regional manufacturing surveys, were consistent with moderate increases in factory output in the near term. Real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) appeared to be rising at a moderate pace in the third quarter.5 The components of nominal retail sales data used by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) to construct its estimates of PCE increased at a solid rate in July and August, and sales of light motor vehicles surged in August after edging down in July. Recent information pertaining to key factors that influence consumer spending were positive: Real disposable incomes continued to increase in July, households' net worth likely edged up as equity prices and home values rose somewhat further, and consumer sentiment as measured by the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers improved in August and early September. The pace of activity in the housing sector seemed to be picking up. Starts and permits of both new single-family homes and multifamily units were higher in July than their average levels in the second quarter. Sales of existing homes increased further in July, although new home sales declined. Real private expenditures for business equipment and intellectual property products appeared to rise further going into the third quarter. Nominal shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft moved up in July. Moreover, new orders for these capital goods continued to be above the level of shipments, pointing to increases in shipments in subsequent months. In addition, other forward-looking indicators, such as surveys of business conditions, were consistent with moderate gains in business equipment spending in the near term. Nominal business expenditures for nonresidential construction also increased in July. Recent book-value data for inventories, along with readings on inventories from national and regional manufacturing surveys, did not point to significant inventory imbalances in most industries; in the energy sector, inventories were drawn down significantly early in the year and, despite substantial stockbuilding since then, remained low. Total real government purchases seemed to be roughly flat in the third quarter. Federal government purchases probably declined a little, as defense spending was lower in July and August than in the second quarter. State and local government purchases appeared to be rising slowly as the payrolls of these governments expanded a bit further in July and August and their nominal construction expenditures increased in July. The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed in both June and July. Exports were little changed in June, but they expanded robustly in July, with particular strength in industrial supplies and automotive products. Imports fell in June but then partly recovered in July, driven by swings in imports of oil and automotive products. Total U.S. consumer price inflation, as measured by the PCE price index, was about 1-1/2 percent over the 12 months ending in July. Over the 12 months ending in August, the consumer price index (CPI) rose about 1-3/4 percent. Consumer energy prices declined in both July and August, while consumer food prices rose. Core price inflation (which excludes food and energy prices) was essentially the same as total inflation for the PCE price measure and for the CPI over their most recent 12-month periods. Near-term inflation expectations from the Michigan survey moved down a bit in August and early September, while longer-term inflation expectations in the survey were little changed. Measures of labor compensation increased a little faster than consumer prices. Compensation per hour in the business sector rose 2-3/4 percent over the year ending in the second quarter; with modest gains in labor productivity, unit labor costs advanced more slowly than compensation per hour. Over the same year-long period, the employment cost index rose only about 2 percent, and average hourly earnings increased at a similar rate over the 12 months ending in August. Foreign economies continued to expand in the second quarter, but with significant differences across countries. Economic growth rebounded strongly from a weak first-quarter pace in Canada, China, and Mexico, supported by improvement in exports. In contrast, the Japanese economy contracted sharply following the consumption tax increase in April, economic activity stagnated in the euro area, and the Brazilian economy fell into recession. In the third quarter, household spending appeared to be normalizing in Japan, and production continued to rise in Mexico. However, indicators of economic activity in the euro area remained weak, and Chinese economic data for July and August suggested some slowing in the third quarter. With inflation very low in the euro area, the European Central Bank reduced its policy interest rates at its September 4 meeting and announced plans to purchase private assets. Staff Review of the Financial SituationData releases on domestic economic activity were reportedly interpreted by financial market participants as somewhat better than expected, on balance, notwithstanding the disappointing employment report for August. Federal Reserve communications, particularly the July FOMC minutes and the Chair's speech at the Jackson Hole economic policy symposium, were viewed as signaling slightly less policy accommodation than anticipated. Reflecting these and other developments, yields on nominal Treasury securities rose somewhat and equity prices edged up over the intermeeting period. On net, the conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine and other geopolitical tensions had limited effects on domestic financial markets. The federal funds rate path implied by financial market quotes was essentially unchanged over the intermeeting period. But the results from the Desk's September Survey of Primary Dealers indicated that the distribution of the likely date of liftoff across dealers shifted to somewhat earlier dates, and showed the second quarter of 2015 as the most likely date for liftoff. However, the dealers' expected levels of various employment and inflation indicators at the time of liftoff did not change materially from the previous survey. The yield on 10-year nominal Treasury securities moved up about 15 basis points, on net, since the FOMC met in July, likely boosted in part by Federal Reserve communications. Measures of inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities edged down, reportedly reflecting the lower-than-expected CPI data in July and recent declines in oil prices. Broad measures of domestic equity prices were up modestly over the intermeeting period, with some reports suggesting that investors were interpreting incoming economic data as implying that the economic recovery was strengthening. Yields on corporate bonds and agency MBS rose about in line with those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities. High-yield bond mutual funds experienced sharp outflows early in the intermeeting period, and spreads on such bonds widened noticeably; however, these spreads returned to their initial levels over subsequent weeks, and high-yield bond funds attracted modest inflows. Measures of liquidity in the corporate bond market remained stable in the face of these substantial flows. Conditions in short-term dollar funding markets were little changed. The Federal Reserve continued its testing of ON RRP operations over the intermeeting period. Take-up in ON RRP operations increased a little, on average, over the period relative to the previous intermeeting period. Credit conditions for domestic businesses remained favorable. Corporate bond issuance slowed in July and August, reflecting a fairly typical summer lull as well as the elevated volatility in the high-yield bond market early in the intermeeting period, but issuance rebounded strongly in the first week of September. Commercial paper outstanding and commercial and industrial loans at banks expanded briskly. Credit conditions in the commercial real estate (CRE) sector continued to ease, and growth in CRE loans at banks stayed solid. The issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities remained robust in July and August. Issuance of institutional leveraged loans continued apace in July and August, traditionally a slow period in this market. The issuance of "new money" loans, which are typically earmarked for corporate leveraged-buyouts and mergers and acquisitions, was strong, and the pipeline of such loans was reported to be quite large heading into the fall. The issuance of collateralized loan obligations was still a major source of demand for leveraged loans. Financing conditions for households remained mixed. Auto loans were widely available; standards and terms for credit card loans eased somewhat, though they were still tight; and access to residential mortgages continued to be limited for all but those with excellent credit histories. Responding in part to disappointing economic data abroad, the U.S. dollar appreciated against most currencies over the intermeeting period, including large appreciations against the euro, the yen, and the pound sterling. Greater monetary accommodation in the euro area and expectations of a lower policy rate in the near term added to the downward pressure on the euro while uncertainty about the outcome of the forthcoming referendum on Scottish independence weighed on the value of the pound. In addition, near-term policy rate expectations moved down in the United Kingdom, reacting to both the release of the August Inflation Report and uncertainty induced by the referendum. Sovereign yields in the European economies generally declined, and yield spreads of sovereign bonds from the euro-area periphery over German bunds narrowed considerably. Most foreign equity indexes ended the period modestly higher. Staff Economic OutlookIn the economic forecast prepared by the staff for the September FOMC meeting, the projection for growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) in the second half of this year was revised down slightly from the one prepared for the previous meeting, primarily because of a somewhat weaker near-term outlook for consumer spending. The staff's medium-term forecast for real GDP was also revised down a little, reflecting a higher projected path for the foreign exchange value of the dollar along with slightly smaller projected gains for home prices. The staff still anticipated that the pace of real GDP growth in 2015 and 2016 would exceed the growth rate of potential output, supported by continued increases in consumer and business confidence, the further easing of the restraint on spending from changes in fiscal policy, additional improvements in credit availability, and a pickup in foreign economic growth. In 2017, real GDP growth was projected to begin slowing toward, but to remain above, the rate of potential output growth. The expansion in economic activity over the projection period was anticipated to steadily reduce resource slack, and the unemployment rate was expected to decline gradually and temporarily move slightly below the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate toward the end of the period. The staff's near-term forecast for inflation was a little lower than the projection prepared for the previous FOMC meeting, reflecting recent readings on core consumer price inflation that were lower than anticipated and declines in oil prices that were faster than expected, but the forecast for inflation over the medium term was little changed. The staff continued to project inflation to be lower in the second half of this year than in the first half and to remain below the Committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent over the next few years. With longer-term inflation expectations assumed to remain stable, resource slack projected to diminish slowly, and changes in commodity and import prices expected to be subdued, inflation was projected to rise gradually and to reach the Committee's objective in the longer run. Overall, the staff's economic projection for the September meeting was quite similar to the forecast presented at the June meeting, when the FOMC last prepared a Summary of Economic Projections (SEP). The staff's September projection showed a slightly higher path for the unemployment rate, a bit lower real GDP growth, and essentially no change to inflation compared with its June forecast. The staff continued to view the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average over the past 20 years. The risks to the forecast for real GDP growth were still seen as tilted a little to the downside, as neither monetary policy nor fiscal policy was viewed as well positioned to help the economy withstand adverse shocks. At the same time, the staff viewed the risks around its outlook for the unemployment rate and for inflation as roughly balanced. Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic OutlookIn conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of the Board of Governors and the Federal Reserve Bank presidents submitted their projections of real output growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the federal funds rate for each year from 2014 through 2017 and over the longer run, conditional on each participant's assessment of appropriate monetary policy. The longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. These economic projections and policy assessments are described in the SEP, which is attached as an addendum to these minutes. In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants viewed the information received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that economic activity was expanding at a moderate rate. On balance, labor market conditions improved somewhat further; however, the unemployment rate was little changed, and most participants judged that there remained significant underutilization of labor resources. Participants generally expected that, over the medium term, real economic activity would increase at a pace sufficient to lead to a further gradual decline in the unemployment rate toward levels consistent with the Committee's objective of maximum employment. Inflation was running below the Committee's longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations were stable. Participants anticipated that inflation would move toward the Committee's 2 percent goal in coming years, with several expressing concern that inflation might persist below the Committee's objective for quite some time. Most viewed the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as broadly balanced. However, a number of participants noted that economic growth over the medium term might be slower than they expected if foreign economic growth came in weaker than anticipated, structural productivity continued to increase only slowly, or the recovery in residential construction continued to lag. Household spending appeared to be rising moderately, with several participants noting that the recent positive reports on retail sales, motor vehicle purchases, and health-care spending had reduced their concern about weakness in the underlying pace of household spending. Among the favorable factors attending the outlook for consumer spending, participants cited continued gains in household wealth, improved household balance sheets, low delinquency rates, a high saving rate, or rising confidence in employment and income prospects. However, other participants said they heard mixed reports from business contacts regarding consumer spending or were uncertain about the prospects for stronger gains in real income necessary to sustain moderate growth in household spending. The recovery in housing activity remained slow in all but a few areas of the country despite relatively low mortgage rates, rising house prices, and improvements in household wealth. Contacts in a couple of Districts reported that new construction was being held back by shortages of materials, of lots available for development, and of skilled workers or by the overhang of vacant homes not on the market. Households with relatively low credit scores continued to have difficulty obtaining mortgage loans. It was noted that this difficulty could be a factor restraining the demand for housing, particularly among younger households who have high levels of student loan debt or weak job prospects. A few participants pointed out the relative strength in construction of and demand for multifamily units, which possibly was due to a shift in demand among younger homebuyers away from single-family homes. Information from business contacts in most parts of the country indicated improvements in business conditions, rising confidence about the economic outlook, and increasing willingness to undertake new investment projects. According to national and regional surveys, manufacturing activity was strong, and several participants had received reports of hiring and increased capital spending in that sector. Among the other industries cited as relatively strong in recent months were transportation, energy, and services. Several participants noted positive signs of further increases in investment spending going forward, including elevated levels of new orders and shipments of capital goods, strong interest in the technology sector, and the need to replace aging capital. A couple of participants added that nonresidential construction activity was rising in their Districts. The improvement in business conditions was reflected in reports of increased demand for loans at banks in several Districts. Demand rose for loans to both households and businesses, and a couple of participants indicated that borrowers were expanding their use of existing credit lines as well as obtaining new commitments. Bankers in one District stated that, while they had eased the terms and conditions on loans in response to competition from other lenders, they had not taken on riskier loans. Some financial developments that could undermine financial stability over time were noted, including a deterioration in leveraged lending standards, stretched stock market valuations, and compressed risk spreads. However, one participant suggested that the leveraged loan market seemed to be moving into better balance, and that market participants appeared to be taking appropriate account of the changes in interest rates that might be associated with the eventual normalization of the stance of monetary policy. Moreover, a couple of participants, while stressing the importance of remaining vigilant about potential risks to financial stability, observed that conditions in financial markets at present did not suggest the types of financial stability considerations that would impede the achievement of the Committee's macroeconomic objectives. Some participants noted that expectations for the path of the federal funds rate implied by market quotes appeared to remain below most of the projections of the federal funds rate provided by Committee participants in the SEP, which represent each individual participant's assessment of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate consistent with his or her economic outlook. However, it was pointed out that measures of financial market participants' expectations incorporate their judgments regarding not only the most likely outcomes, but also the possible downside tail risks that might be associated with especially low paths for the federal funds rate. For example, respondents to the recent Survey of Primary Dealers placed considerable odds on the federal funds rate returning to the zero lower bound during the two years following the initial increase in that rate. The probability that investors attach to such low interest rate scenarios could pull the expected path of the federal funds rate computed from market quotes below most Committee participants' assessments of appropriate policy as reported in the SEP. The restraint on economic activity from fiscal policy was seen as diminishing, and a couple of participants pointed out that, over the second half of the year, the remaining drag was likely to be small. Nonetheless, the cutbacks in both defense and nondefense federal outlays, as well as state governments' budget restraint, continued to weigh on jobs and income in some parts of the country. Fiscal policy overall was anticipated to be a neutral factor for economic growth over the next several years. During participants' discussion of prospects for economic activity abroad, they commented on a number of uncertainties and risks attending the outlook. Over the intermeeting period, the foreign exchange value of the dollar had appreciated, particularly against the euro, the yen, and the pound sterling. Some participants expressed concern that the persistent shortfall of economic growth and inflation in the euro area could lead to a further appreciation of the dollar and have adverse effects on the U.S. external sector. Several participants added that slower economic growth in China or Japan or unanticipated events in the Middle East or Ukraine might pose a similar risk. At the same time, a couple of participants pointed out that the appreciation of the dollar might also tend to slow the gradual increase in inflation toward the FOMC's 2 percent goal. Labor market conditions continued to improve over the intermeeting period. Although the unemployment rate was little changed, participants variously cited positive readings from other indicators, including a decline in longer-term unemployment, the low level of new claims for unemployment insurance, the rise in job openings, and survey reports of increased hiring plans and job availability. While the most recent estimate of nonfarm payroll employment showed a smaller monthly gain than earlier in the year, it followed six months in which increases had averaged more than 200,000. Some participants were reluctant to place much weight on one monthly report or noted that the first estimate for August has frequently been revised up in recent years. Participants generally agreed that the accumulated progress in labor market conditions since the Committee's current asset purchase program began in September 2012 had been substantial and expected that progress would be sustained. Nonetheless, they continued to express differing views on the extent of remaining slack in labor markets. Most agreed that underutilization of labor resources remained significant; these participants noted variously that the level of nonfarm payroll jobs had only recently returned to its pre-recession level, that the number of individuals working part time for economic reasons was still elevated relative to the level of unemployment, and that the labor force participation rate was still below assessments of its structural trend. In this regard, a couple of participants pointed out that the stability of the participation rate, on balance, over the past year suggested that some of the cyclical shortfall had diminished. Most agreed that the Committee's assessment of labor market slack should be grounded in its review of a range of labor market indicators, although a few saw the gap between the unemployment rate and their estimate of its longer-run normal level as a reliable indicator of slack. Most measures of labor compensation showed no broad-based increase in wage inflation. However, businesses in several Districts continued to report upward pressure on wages in specific industries and occupations associated with labor shortages or difficult-to-fill jobs, while a couple of participants noted a more general rise in current or planned wage increases in their regions. Several participants commented that the relatively subdued rise in nominal labor compensation was still below longer-run trend rates of productivity growth and inflation and was a signal of slack remaining in the labor market. However, a couple of others suggested some caution in reading subdued wage inflation as an indicator of labor market underutilization. They pointed out that if nominal wages did not adjust downward when unemployment was high, pent-up wage deflation could help explain the modest increases in wages so far during the recovery, and wages could rise more rapidly going forward as the unemployment rate continues to decline. Inflation had been running below the Committee's longer-run objective, and the readings on consumer prices over the intermeeting period were somewhat softer than during the preceding four months, in part because of declining energy prices. Most participants anticipated that inflation would move gradually back toward its objective over the medium term. However, participants differed somewhat in their assessments of how quickly inflation would move up. Some cited the stability of longer-run inflation expectations at a level consistent with the Committee's objective as an important factor in their forecasts that inflation would reach 2 percent in coming years. Participants' views on the responsiveness of inflation to the level and change in resource utilization varied, with a few seeing labor markets as sufficiently tight that wages and prices would soon begin to move up noticeably but with some others indicating that inflation was unlikely to approach 2 percent until the unemployment rate falls below its longer-run normal level. While most viewed the risk that inflation would run persistently below 2 percent as having diminished somewhat since earlier in the year, a couple noted the possibility that longer-term inflation expectations might be slightly lower than the Committee's 2 percent objective or that domestic inflation might be held down by persistent disinflation among U.S. trading partners and further appreciation of the dollar. In their discussion of the appropriate path for monetary policy over the medium term, meeting participants agreed that the timing of the first increase in the federal funds rate and the appropriate path of the policy rate thereafter would depend on incoming economic data and their implications for the outlook. That said, several participants thought that the current forward guidance regarding the federal funds rate suggested a longer period before liftoff, and perhaps also a more gradual increase in the federal funds rate thereafter, than they believed was likely to be appropriate given economic and financial conditions. In addition, the concern was raised that the reference to "considerable time" in the current forward guidance could be misunderstood as a commitment rather than as data dependent. However, it was noted that the current formulation of the Committee's forward guidance clearly indicated that the Committee's policy decisions were conditional on its ongoing assessment of realized and expected progress toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation, and that its assessment reflected its review of a broad array of economic indicators. It was emphasized that the current forward guidance for the federal funds rate was data dependent and did not indicate that the first increase in the target range for the federal funds rate would occur mechanically after some fixed calendar interval following the completion of the current asset purchase program. If employment and inflation converged more rapidly toward the Committee's goals than currently expected, the date of liftoff could be earlier, and subsequent increases in the federal funds rate target more rapid, than participants currently anticipated. Conversely, if employment and inflation returned toward the Committee's objectives more slowly than currently anticipated, the date of liftoff for the federal funds rate could be later, and future federal funds rate target increases could be more gradual. In addition, some participants saw the current forward guidance as appropriate in light of risk-management considerations, which suggested that it would be prudent to err on the side of patience while awaiting further evidence of sustained progress toward the Committee's goals. In their view, the costs of downside shocks to the economy would be larger than those of upside shocks because, in current circumstances, it would be less problematic to remove accommodation quickly, if doing so becomes necessary, than to add accommodation. A number of participants also noted that changes to the forward guidance might be misinterpreted as a signal of a fundamental shift in the stance of policy that could result in an unintended tightening of financial conditions. Participants also discussed how the forward-guidance language might evolve once the Committee decides that the current formulation no longer appropriately conveys its intentions about the future stance of policy. Most participants indicated a preference for clarifying the dependence of the current forward guidance on economic data and the Committee's assessment of progress toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. A clarification along these lines was seen as likely to improve the public's understanding of the Committee's reaction function while allowing the Committee to retain flexibility to respond appropriately to changes in the economic outlook. One participant favored using a numerical threshold based on the inflation outlook as a form of forward guidance. A few participants, however, noted the difficulties associated with expressing forward guidance in terms of numerical thresholds for some set of economic variables. Another participant indicated a preference for reducing reliance on explicit forward guidance in the statement and conveying instead guidance regarding the future stance of monetary policy through other mechanisms, including the SEP. It was noted that providing explicit forward guidance regarding the future path of the federal funds rate might become less important once a highly accommodative stance of policy is no longer appropriate and the process of policy normalization is well under way. It was generally agreed that when changes to the forward guidance become appropriate, they will likely present communication challenges, and that caution will be needed to avoid sending unintended signals about the Committee's policy outlook. Committee Policy ActionIn their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the FOMC met in July indicated that economic activity was expanding at a moderate pace. Household spending appeared to be rising moderately, and business fixed investment was advancing, while the recovery in the housing sector remained slow. Fiscal policy was restraining economic growth, although the extent of restraint was diminishing and would soon be quite small. Inflation was running below the Committee's longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations were stable. The Committee expected that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity would expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators and inflation moving toward levels that the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. With incoming information continuing to broadly support the Committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward the Committee's 2 percent objective, members agreed that a further measured reduction in the pace of asset purchases was appropriate at this meeting. Accordingly, the Committee agreed that, beginning in October, it would add to its holdings of agency MBS at a pace of $5 billion per month rather than $10 billion per month, and it would add to its holdings of longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $10 billion per month rather than $15 billion per month. The Committee judged that, if incoming information broadly supported its expectations that labor market indicator and inflation would continue to move toward mandate-consistent levels, it would end its current program of asset purchases at its October meeting. Members discussed their assessments of progress toward the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation and considered possible enhancements to the statement that would more clearly communicate the Committee's view on such progress. Regarding the labor market, many members indicated that, although labor market conditions had generally continued to improve, there was still significant slack in labor markets. A few members, however, expressed reservations about continuing to characterize the extent of underutilization of labor resources as significant. In the end, members agreed to indicate that labor market conditions had improved somewhat further, but that the unemployment rate was little changed and a range of labor market indicators continued to suggest that there remained significant underutilization of labor resources. It was noted, however, that the characterization of labor market underutilization might have to be changed if progress in the labor market continued. Regarding inflation, members agreed that inflation had moved closer to the Committee's 2 percent objective during the first half of the year but, more recently, had fallen back somewhat. As a consequence, they updated the language in the statement to indicate that inflation had been running below the Committee's longer-run objective. However, with stable longer-term inflation expectations, the Committee continued to judge that the likelihood of inflation running persistently below 2 percent had diminished somewhat since early in the year. After the discussion, all members but two voted to maintain the Committee's target range for the federal funds rate and to reiterate its forward guidance about the federal funds rate. The guidance continued to state that the Committee's decisions about how long to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate would depend on its assessment of actual and expected progress toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. The Committee again anticipated that it likely would be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continued to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remained well anchored. The forward guidance also reiterated the Committee's expectation that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run. Two members, however, dissented because, in their view, the statement language did not accurately reflect the progress made to date toward the Committee's goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent, and they believed that ongoing progress will likely warrant an earlier increase in the federal funds rate than suggested by the forward guidance in the Committee's postmeeting statement. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: Voting for this action: Janet L. Yellen, William C. Dudley, Lael Brainard, Stanley Fischer, Narayana Kocherlakota, Loretta J. Mester, Jerome H. Powell, and Daniel K. Tarullo. Voting against this action: Richard W. Fisher and Charles I. Plosser. President Fisher dissented because he believed that the continued strengthening of the real economy, the improved outlook for labor utilization and for general price stability, and continued signs of financial market excess will likely warrant an earlier reduction in monetary accommodation than is suggested by the Committee's stated forward guidance. Mr. Plosser dissented because he objected to the statement's guidance indicating that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for "a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends." In his view, the reference to calendar time should be replaced with language that indicates how monetary policy will respond to incoming data. Moreover, he judged that the statement did not acknowledge the substantial progress that had been made toward the Committee's economic goals and thus risks unnecessary and disruptive volatility in financial markets, and perhaps in the economy, if the Committee reduces accommodation sooner or more quickly than financial markets anticipate. It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday-Wednesday, October 28-29, 2014. The meeting adjourned at 10:35 a.m. on September 17, 2014. Notation VoteBy notation vote completed on August 19, 2014, the Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the Committee meeting held on July 29-30, 2014. FREE AppDownload
Facebook/Jay Leno's GarageComedian Jay Leno, the former host of NBC's "The Tonight Show," is working on a deal for a CNBC show, The Hollywood Reporter reports, citing unnamed sources. Leno, a fixture for the late-night NBC talk show, retired earlier this year after 22 years on-air.  According to THR, Leno's new show would focus on his passion for cars. The 64-year-old comedian has an incredible collection of 150 cars and motorcycles. He also has a web series on NBC.com called "Jay Leno's Garage." If the CNBC deal goes through, the show would be part of the network's primetime lineup. The financial network has seen its daytime ratings struggle in the past few years. Primetime, however, seems to be the bright spot for CNBC lately. CNBC's primetime ratings saw a serious boost after it began airing re-runs of "Shark Tank." A CNBC spokesperson declined to comment.  FREE AppDownload
In honor of the new fiscal year, the Brookings Institution released the Fiscal Impact Measure, an interactive chart by senior fellow Louise Sheiner that shows how the balance of government spending and tax revenues have affected US GDP growth. The takeaway? Fiscal policies have been a drag on economic growth since 2011.   According to Brookings, the chart is similar to the ones produced internally by staff economists at the Fed for their policymakers, only this one is available to the public. That makes sense — Janet Yellen made a big speech way back in February 2013 about how much of a drag fiscal policy has been on the recovery, and she has mentioned it since becoming Fed chair.  There's a whole Brookings interactive on the project website, which also includes charts on jobs, state and local tax receipts, and projected federal revenues and spending.

Wikimedia CommonsShares of Sears were down as much as 15% on Wednesday after a report from Bloomberg's Lauren Coleman-Lochner said that at least one "medium-sized" vendor had halted shipments to the store.  Coleman-Lochner, citing people with knowledge of the matter, reported that insurance firms for the retailer's vendors were seeking to reduce coverage of orders to the company.  As Coleman-Lochner writes, "Suppliers rely on credit insurance to protect themselves against not getting paid for products they ship to retailers," adding that, "Under the terms of most policies, insurers are allowed to cancel if a retailer’s operations deteriorate enough that its viability is in doubt." Vendor insurers took similar measures on J.C. Penney Co. last year but resumed coverage as the company's sales rebounded, Coleman-Lochner reported, noting that while this action from insurers was a "red flag," retailers could recover.  12:45 pm ET update Sears issued a statement following Bloomberg's report, saying that, "In response to a misleading article recently published, we want to make sure our vendors and the marketplace know all the facts and understand that Sears Holdings has significant financial flexibility to execute our transformation and meet our obligations." The company said it has "significant financial flexibility" and that it "continues to meet all of [its] obligations."  Here's the full statement from Sears spokesman Howard Riefs: In response to a misleading article recently published, we want to make sure our vendors and the marketplace know all the facts and understand that Sears Holdings has significant financial flexibility to execute our transformation and meet our obligations.

 The head of Temasek USA Boon Sim was recently interviewed by OneWire CEO Skiddy von Stade. He manages a $223 billion portfolio in the investment company owned by the Singaporean government, and had some pearls for anyone just starting out their careers. He talked about making the switch from an engineering degree to a career in finance, when he landed an internship with Credit Suisse in 1991. They were looking for people with a tech background to deal with companies like Cisco.  He worked there for 20 years and rose from intern to Global Head of Mergers and Acquisitions. He recently went back to his home country to give the commencement speech at his alma mater, the National University of Singapore. Here's some of his advice: "I would tell kids to keep an open mind. If you think about my career, where I've lived, what I've done - when I grew up in Singapore, I never envisioned I would be doing this ... I would say have a sense of adventure, try something new, take a risk, never talk yourself out of a adventurous situations, and its a big world out there. Be an explorer." After graduation, Sim says he wants three things from employees. Here's how he put it in the video: "One, we look for people who have high integrity - that's number one on our list. Two, we look for people who have a track record of accomplishments, whether it's in not-for-profit or for-profit - it doesn't really matter. We look for people with that track record, meaning that they were tenacious, they stayed with it. That's something that is important to us. Thirdly, we look for people who are intellectually curious, who never stop learning, who are always asking "what's the next," "gee how does this work," "help me understand this," because that's what drives our business."

Screenshot Via YouTubeHarvard professor David Malan teaches CS50, the college's most popular course.Yale may want to get its hands on the most popular undergraduate course at Harvard — Computer Science 50: Introduction to Computer Science I, better known as CS50. The Harvard Crimson reports that Yale's computer science department is currently reviewing a proposal to stream CS50 lectures at Yale, "where an on-the-ground instructor and support staff, including teaching fellows, will hold standard sections and office hours and handle grading." If approved, Yale could begin offering CS50 to its students in fall 2015. CS50, taught by Harvard professor David J. Malan, provides an introduction to computer science and programming, covering topics such as algorithms, software engineering, and web development, according to Harvard's course catalog. Students also learn computer languages including PHP and JavaScript. The class has become hugely popular at Harvard because it serves a broad audience, Harvard professor Harry Lewis, a former Harvard College dean who serves as director of undergraduate studies for the computer science department, recently told Business Insider. "[CS50] is the introductory course for computer science concentrations, and it's also a course for students who want a serious introduction but are not planning to be majors," Lewis said. Malan, a dynamic lecturer, is also popular with students, Lewis said, describing him as "a fabulous teacher" who is "very, very innovative in how he's rethinking the traditional parts of the course." Yale computer science professor James Aspnes, who also serves as the director of undergraduate studies for the department, told The Crimson that his "understanding is that...Harvard’s CS50 has substantially more resources than we do at Yale." CS50 receives external funding from tech companies such as Facebook and Google, The Crimson reported last month. This partnership comes at a time when the number of computer science students seems to be rapidly increasing. The Crimson reports that Yale has around 200 undergraduate CS majors, while Harvard has 253. 848 Harvard students are currently enrolled in CS50, making it the most popular undergraduate course in the school. This week, a university report revealed that for the first time ever more Harvard undergraduates majored in engineering and applied science fields than studied in the arts and humanities.

The number of job vacancies in August reached the highest level since 2001. But unemployed women aren't applying to those jobs as aggressively as unemployed men. This is because when women lose their employment, they are more likely to leave the labor force than men are. Wells Fargo's John Silvia argues in a new research note that this is a reflection of old gender roles: "Unemployed women have traditionally had a higher propensity to leave the labor force than their male counterparts. Their historical role as the secondary breadwinner and other family responsibilities likely alter the urgency at which unemployed women seek employment (as well as overall participation rates). The gap between transitioning to a job and exiting the labor force for women, however, has been exacerbated by low rates of finding employment. While a rising share of unemployed women are finding work, only around 20 percent are becoming employed versus 25 percent dropping out of the workforce." Silvia also notes that the transition rate from unemployment to employment is low by historical standards. In August, just 22 percent of unemployed people found jobs within a month, compared to 30 percent prior to the 2001 recession. Still, these two charts show that there's a gender gap in who decides to find a new job.Wells Fargo FREE AppDownload
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc said on Wednesday it was surprised by supplier GT Advanced Technologies Inc's bankruptcy filing this week, and is now considering its next steps. GT Advanced, slated to supply scratch-resistant sapphire displays from a new Arizona factory Apple is helping bankroll, filed for bankruptcy on Monday but has offered little explanation as to why. In the iPhone maker's first public response, it said it was working with Arizona officials on its next moves. "We are focused on preserving jobs in Arizona following GT's surprising decision and we will continue to work with state and local officials as we consider our next steps," spokesman Chris Gaither said. GT's first Chapter 11 bankruptcy court hearing is set for Thursday. The New Hampshire-based company has said it will then explain what led to Monday's surprise bankruptcy filing that wiped out 90 percent of the sapphire supplier's market value. Until the hearing, industry insiders and Wall Street analysts have been left to speculate as to what triggered the move. Apple's supply chain is said to be one of the best-run in the consumer electronics business. GT's shares had more than doubled in the nine months between November's announcement of the new Arizona plant and the launch of Apple's new large-screen iPhones on Sept. 9. Investors had hoped GT would replicate Corning Inc's &lt;GLW.N&gt; success with Gorilla Glass. Shares of GT were up 30 percent at $1.57 on Wednesday morning. On Monday morning, the shares opened at $11.06.  (Reporting by Noel Randewich; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli and David Gregorio) (Editing by Meredith Mazzilli) FREE AppDownload
Bloomberg TV David Einhorn is giving back big to his alma mater. The billionaire hedge fund manager will donate $50 million to Cornell University over ten years through the Einhorn Family Charitable Trust for a new programme called Engaged Cornell. According to the university it is: "A goal of the initiative is to empower Cornell students to become active citizens and to tackle critical challenges by participating in hands-on, practical learning experiences in communities at home and around the world." For example, Forbes' Nathan Vardi reports students might develop a theater ensemble with men in a maximum security prison , or head to developing countries to learn about their healthcare systems. The university is hoping to raise an additional $150 million through Einhorn's involvement. To Einhorn this is a way to give students a chance to have the experience he had. When he was at Cornell he spent time working at the Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington. “It did give me some real world experience about how the workplace works and how people behave,” he told Forbes.

REUTERS/Peter Morgan PMShares of retailer Sears got pummeled on a Bloomberg News' report that a "medium sized" vendor had halted shipments. The stock was last trading down 15% at about $25.72 per share.  This is more bad news for billionaire hedge fund manager Eddie Lampert. Lampert—who runs Florida based ESL Investments and is the chairman/CEO of Sears—has spent years trying to turnaround the beleaguered big-box retailer. Lampert is also the largest individual shareholder the retailer. So far, the investment has been a disaster.  According to data compiled by Bloomberg, Lampert last personally held 25,226,096 shares, or about 23.69% of the company's stock. That means Lampert has lost about $115.5 million on his Sears investment since yesterday's close.   RBS Partners, which is managed by ESL Investments, last held 26,438,272 shares, or 24.83 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg shows.  Since yesterday's close, the fund's stake has lost $121.08 million, according to our calculations.

ReutersBill AckmanPharmaceutical company Allergan is still showing no signs of going quietly. Bill Ackman and fellow pharmaceutical company Valeant have once again raised their bid for the company, continuing a saga that has gone on since April, when Ackman and Valeant first announced that they would try to acquire Allergan. This is the third time the duo have raised their bid, bringing it up to $191 a share or $56 billion in cash from the original bid of $177 a share or $47 billion. A lack of significant movement in both Valeant and Allergan's stocks after this announcements suggests that the market isn't convinced this is the final move. There are a bunch of serious questions lingering about how much Valeant can pay, what the law will allow given the way this deal was structured, and whether or not some other pharmaceutical company might come in and ruin the party for Ackman and Valeant. First thing's first — can Valeant afford to go higher? In an interview on Bloomberg TV Ackman said in no uncertain terms that Valeant CEO Mike Pearson would not overpay for the company. "As much as an Allergan shareholder, you would say, oh, I want the acquirer to overpay for me, when your acquirer is paying in stock, what you want them to do is you want them to overpay for you they day they buy you and thereafter, never overpay for anything again," he said. "And the problem is it doesn't work that way. The CEO is prepared to pay for you is a CEO whose stock you do not want to own an interest in. And I think what Mike is saying, I think what he has demonstrated is that being a disciplined acquirer, offering full and fair value but not overpaying, has enabled him to do 100-odd transactions over six years." But at a certain point, this deal will become to expensive for Valeant, and it could be that Allergan is counting on that. From the beginning Allergan has pushed Valeant away arguing that it has no real growth, that it merely cuts research and development from the companies it acquires and sells their popular products — in Allergan's case Botox, for example — at a lower price, boosting sales without really boosting profits. In the meantime, Allergan is challenging the entire deal in Court. Its latest attempt to shut the deal down happened earlier this week, when it filed a motion in California that would not allow Ackman to vote his 10% share in Allergan at December's shareholder meeting. Ackman acquired 10% of Allergan before announcing that he was teaming up with Valeant to do this deal — the first time a hedge fund and a company ever teamed up to do a corporate takeover. Regulators are investigating whether or not there was insider trading involved there, and Allergan is suing Valeant and Ackman on the same basis. While all of this is going on, there's still the possibility that another buyer interested in Allergan — one without the legal issues or the controversy surrounding its profit — could step into the game. According to Reuters, Actavis is talking to Allergan about possibly buying the company. Nothing formal has been offered, but given how difficult Allergan is making this deal for Ackman and Valeant, the fact that talks are happening at all isn't the surprising. Activis could be Allergan's white knight. And Allergan's white knight is Bill Ackman's headache. FREE AppDownload

Thomson ReutersPeople walk past the building of the bank Safra next to the Paradeplatz square in ZurichZURICH (Reuters) - Switzerland will begin negotiations soon with the European Union and some other countries on automatically sharing data on Swiss bank accounts held by foreigners, the government said on Wednesday. It could start exchanging data in 2018 at the earliest, once an international standard is in place and pending parliamentary and even voter approval. Switzerland, the world's biggest offshore financial center with more than $2 trillion in assets under management, has come under huge pressure from the European Union and the United States to end bank secrecy as cash-strapped countries clamp down on tax evasion. Under automatic information exchange, if an individual opens a bank account in a foreign country, the tax authority in the person's country of origin will automatically be informed. In May, Switzerland agreed to join other countries in sharing tax information once this is established as a global standard, effectively signaling an end to Swiss banking secrecy. "Negotiations with partner states should commence shortly," the government said in a statement on Wednesday, but gave no indication of how soon that might be. "The first exchange of information could take place in 2018, subject to parliament and possibly voters approving the necessary laws and agreements in good time," it said. The government did not name the non-EU countries with which it will negotiate on automatic exchanging data.  (Reporting by Alice Baghdjian; Editing by Susan Fenton) FREE AppDownload
Deleon RealtyAtherton, a small town in Silicon Valley, has been named America's most expensive zip code for the second year in a row, according to Forbes. To determine the rankings, Mountain View-based firm Altos Research calculated the median home listing prices for 28,500 zip codes across the country.  In Atherton, the median listing price was a whopping $9.03 million, landing it at the top of the list. The town itself is quiet and secluded, and building codes prohibit commercial development. Still, it's not far from the bustling tech-centered towns of Palo Alto and Menlo Park.  "Atherton is drawing a lot of young executives: CIOs, CFOs, and CEOs," Silicon Valley broker Ken DeLeon said to Forbes. "And the international buyers really draw on the prestige."

ScreenshotGoPro shares were down more than 6% in early trade on Wednesday after analysts at both Barclays and Piper Jaffray published cautious comments on the stock.  Joseph Wolf at Barclays, who maintained an Equal Weight rating on the stock, wrote, "We have been struggling with GPRO's valuation since early September." Wolf adds that using the full diluted 150 million shares of GoPro, the stock is trading at about eight times its 2015 revenues, and says that it's not uncommon for growth stocks like GoPro to trade at 10 to 20 times revenues. But some other dynamics are currently affecting GoPro's stock price.  Wolf wrote: "We are fairly certain that a large percentage of the limited 20 million share free float is now owned by retail investors, not institutions."  Wolf added: "We do not expect any short-term fundamental misses and think expectations are reasonable. However, we believe the end of the IPO lock-up period for the stock on Dec 22 will dramatically increase the supply of stock and could place pressure on the share price."  So, two things to note here. One, if a large number of GoPro shares are being held by retail investors, it most likely indicates that the stock is being actively traded and flipped, and the stock price right now is unlikely to reflect measured expectations of the company's future earnings.  Second, news last week that GoPro's founder and CEO Nick Woodman would gift 5.8 million shares to a charitable trust, and that as part of this JPMorgan would release the trust from the lock-up restriction, sent shares of GoPro lower.  But the actual end of the lock-up restriction is still a few months away, and Wolf notes that this ought to already be considered by investors. Typically, when more shares of a company come into the public market, the price of the stock falls as supply exceeds demand, and given that GoPro's listed shares have risen so sharply, current GoPro investors should be ready for this event.  All of this, however, is on the background of Wolf still seeing the company's fundamentals as being in great shape. "We do not expect an execution miss-step to drive a valuation correction," Wolf wrote.  Also on Tuesday, Sean Naughton at Piper Jaffray downgraded GoPro, to Neutral from Overweight, writing that, "the current valuation leaves little room for additional upside." "We remain bullish on GoPro's growth opportunity, both in the near-term and longer-term," Naughton said, "but would wait for a more attractive entry point." On Tuesday, Piper Jaffray also released its latest Taking Stock With Teens survey, which showed that 17.2% of respondents said their family owned a GoPro, up from 12.6% in spring 2014 and up from 9.3% in fall 2013.  FREE AppDownload
Joe Raedle/Getty ImagesA student studies for the SAT college admissions test with her tutor. We saw these calculations and charts — compiled by the National Center for Fair &amp; Open Testing, using data from College Board — in The Wall Street Journal, which reports that "the SAT is just another area in American life where economic inequality results in much more than just disparate incomes." Students whose parents made more than $200,ooo — the highest income bracket — on average scored 1722 out of 2400, almost 400 points higher than students from the lowest income bracket, who scored 1324 on average. "Given the widespread use of the SAT in college admissions, the implications are obvious: Not only are the wealthiest families best equipped to pay for college, their kids on average are more likely to post the sort of scores that make admissions easy," according to The Journal. This chart shows the average scores on each section of the test — plus the combined score of the three sections — by parental income: As you can see, the average SAT score rises in each income bracket. And here is the score difference above and below the national average for families of various incomes: The average SAT score for the Class of 2014 was 1497 out of 2400. FREE AppDownload
APThe US budget deficit fell by nearly one-third from fiscal year 2013 through fiscal year 2014 and is now at the lowest point it's been under President Barack Obama's tenure.  The Congressional Budget Office on Wednesday said the US budget deficit plunged to $486 billion in FY2014, which was $195 billion less than the shortfall recorded in FY2013. It's the smallest deficit recorded since 2008. FY2014 was the fifth consecutive year the deficit declined as a percentage of GDP. It is now an estimated 2.8% of GDP, a percentage that puts it below the average of the past 40 years. The deficit has fallen sharply over the past few years, despite constant brinksmanship in Washington over raising the US debt ceiling. But concern about deficits has virtually disappeared from the campaign trail ahead of the 2014 midterm elections after being a central theme of 2010's elections. "Politicians campaigning this fall have rarely raised the subject, not to mention the difficult prescriptions that are required to deal with red ink," said Greg Valliere, the chief political strategist at Potomac Research Group, in a recent note.

APThe US budget deficit fell by nearly one-third from fiscal year 2013 through fiscal year 2014 and is now at the lowest point it's been under President Barack Obama's tenure.  The Congressional Budget Office on Wednesday said the US budget deficit plunged to $486 billion in FY2014, which was $195 billion less than the shortfall recorded in FY2013. It's the smallest deficit recorded since 2008. FY2014 was the fifth consecutive year the deficit declined as a percentage of GDP. It is now an estimated 2.8% of GDP, a percentage that puts it below the average of the past 40 years. The deficit has fallen sharply over the past few years, despite constant brinksmanship in Washington over raising the US debt ceiling. But concern about deficits has virtually disappeared from the campaign trail ahead of the 2014 midterm elections after being a central theme of 2010's elections. "Politicians campaigning this fall have rarely raised the subject, not to mention the difficult prescriptions that are required to deal with red ink," said Greg Valliere, the chief political strategist at Potomac Research Group, in a recent note.

REUTERS/Andres Stapff The stock market is on a tremendous, multiyear bull market, though of course there have been a lot of dips along the way. But something seems to be different about the recent sell-off in stocks, which has pushed major indices down to levels not seen since August. Just over a week ago, Dan Greenhaus of BTIG wrote this about the conversations he was having with clients: What we find most interesting about the five session, 2.3% drop in equity prices, is not the shallowness of the decline, nor its length (or lack thereof). It was the speed at which sentiment shifted from bullishness to bearishness. Newspaper articles, television commentary and client interactions all appeared to shift on a dime, suggesting that perhaps, just maybe, people aren’t as comfortable in their bullishness as some may assert. We find this interesting given the table below which details exactly how positive the fourth quarter tends to be. Why is this selloff causing such alarm? Or to put it another way, why is the selloff different this time? The answer may be found in the interest-rate environment. To put it simply, signs exist all over the place that the market is anticipating monetary policy to tighten in the not-so-distant future, which is something we just haven't seen in the post-financial-crisis environment. Here, for example, is a chart of two-year interest rates. After years of grinding lower and lower, they're now on a slow uptrend, which most likely reflects the prospect of interest-rate hikes in the cards sometime in 2015. FRED But that's just part of the story. Here's a chart of five-year real interest rates (real interest rates are calculated by taking interest rates on vanilla government bonds, and then adjusting for inflation). After years and years of declining real interest rates (meaning that inflation was running hotter than the nominal yield), real interest rates are now positive and appear to be trending higher. This is another sign of tightening monetary policy.   FRED Another chart to check out is the 5-Year, 5-Year Forward Inflation Expectation Rate, which is the market's expectation of what inflation will be over the coming years. As you can see, inflation expectations have been tanking lately. This is ominous for the Fed, as inflation expectations are starting to head toward levels below the Fed targets.   FRED The upshot of all this is that monetary policy is tightening. Interest rates are rising. Real interest rates are positive and are rising. And inflation expectations are nosediving. This is not what we've seen in previous market sell-offs throughout this bull market. The market is fearing a too-early tightening cycle that snuffs out inflation (and possibly the recovery) before it even has the chance to get anywhere. In the past, markets could be soothed by the belief that a tightening cycle by the Fed was a long way out. Not anymore. FREE AppDownload
Dr. Ed's BlogOver in Europe, one of the worst-performing stock markets is in Germany. The German MSCI is down 15.3% ytd. This reflects the dramatic weakening in Germany’s economy in recent months. The Eurozone’s recovery since last summer was very slow and fragile. The region’s economy seems to have been especially hard hit by the Ukraine crisis and the sanctions imposed against Russia. That’s especially so for Germany, where manufacturing orders dropped 5.7% during August to the lowest level since May 2013. Industrial production excluding construction plunged 4.3% during the month to the lowest since January 2013. The situation might have actually worsened during September given that Germany’s M-PMI dropped below 50.0 to 49.9, the lowest since June 2013. This series is highly correlated with the expectations diffusion index of the Ifo Business Climate Index, which dropped below zero for the first time since January 2013.

Oli Scarff/Getty ImagesThe IMF has called on European governments to guarantee bank lending to companies in order to support the region's economic recovery. The plan would put taxpayers on the hook for loans that go bad, loans that banks are either unable to make currently or are too risky to make. In its Global Financial Stability Report released Wednesday the Fund says over six years since Lehman Brothers failed, banks accounting for 40% of total assets held in all banks globally — a number that's in the trillions of dollars — are still unable to provide enough credit to the global economy to support a recovery. Bank loans allow companies to invest in new technology, take on more staff or purchase competitors in order to grow their businesses and help boost the economy more generally. Small firms in particular rely on bank lending as they are too small to access bond markets, where larger firms have been able to get access to a plentiful supply of cheap funds. The problems are particularly concentrated in Europe. The report finds that whereas the US has already seen a substantial improvement in the amount of bank lending, "real credit growth is already lagging behind the average recovery path in past banking crises in the euro area and the United Kingdom." These concerns have already prompted the European Central Bank (ECB) to announce a plan to buy private sector assets from Europe's banks, giving those banks more cash to boost lending across the region. However, the IMF offers an interesting addition to improve the effectiveness of their plan — governments could directly or indirectly guarantee lending. The report says: Targeted fiscal support (guarantees by pan-European agencies) would further encourage this type of market-based funding. What this means is that bank lending across Europe in the aftermath of the Great Recession has fallen significantly behind where is has been at similar stages in past financial crises. In order for Europe to recover, its banks are going to have to change their business models in favour of lending to people and businesses rather than investing money in stocks and bonds. Unfortunately, the countries most in need of these funds in the vulnerable Euro Area are those that are still plagued by high unemployment, distressed loans (where the borrowers are struggling to meet repayments or are already behind on them) and government spending cuts. This creates an uncertain environment into which banks have proven unwilling to lend. So, as the chart below shows, lending to countries like Greece has been contracting sharply: IMF In his opening remarks José Viñals, director of the monetary and capital markets department at the IMF, said: The good news is that banks are much safer now, having increased their capital levels and liquidity. However, this GFSR finds that many banks do not have the financial muscle to provide enough credit to vigorously support the recovery. The IMF is in effect asking European governments to issue taxpayer guarantees in order to overcome the banks' reluctance to lend to vulnerable states. This is unlikely to please German policymakers who have been campaigning vigorously to avoid German taxpayers having to shoulder more responsibility for the future of the euro. The IMF's message to them is this — you may not have a choice. FREE AppDownload
via The TelegraphThe International Monetary Fund has released its latest health check on the global economy. In the second of its twice yearly World Economic Outlooks, the Fund has revised down its expectations for global growth. The world economy is now expected to grow by only 3.3pc in 2014 (down from 3.7pc in April) and 3.8pc in 2015 (down from an earlier estimation of 4pc), say the IMF. According to the Fund's chief economist, Olivier Blanchard, economic growth "is mediocre and a bit worse than forecast." But aside from the headlines figures, what are the other takeaways from the report? Falling prices have continued to act on a drag on growth in advanced economies. The IMF thinks inflation remains “too low” and the threat of outright deflation – or negative prices – should continue to concern policy-makers. via The Telegraph Although the IMF thinks it unlikely we will have outright deflation in any major economy by the end of the year, price rises are likely to remain below many central bank targets of around 2pc (see blue line above). The threat of deflation is most acute in the eurozone where prices rose by just 0.3pc last month, the lowest since November 2009. As a result, the IMF think the probability of prices to begin falling across the currency bloc in the last three months of the year, to be about 30pc. via The Telegraph One of the reasons inflation has failed to take off, despite growth in many parts of the advanced world, is due to the existence of an 'output gap' in a number countries. This is the term economists use to describe the level of spare capacity in an economy, or the difference between current and potential growth. A negative output gap indicates an economy is running below its potential and has a way to go before growth begins to generate inflationary pressures and forcing interest rate rises. via The Telegraph According to IMF estimates, the United States has the largest negative output gap in the developing world of around 3.5pc of potential GDP, while the UK's is much smaller at around -1.2pc. According to the government's fiscal watchdog, Britain's output gap is not much more than 2pc. If the IMF's figures are closer to reality, this narrowing gap is not likely to be good news for the Chancellor, as it would mean the UK is approaching its full potential rate of growth. In such a scenario, less of our deficit and borrowing could be eliminated by stronger output and higher tax revenues, and more of the work of balancing the books would have to come from further austerity instead. For all the gloominess, the IMF still think there is only a one in 100 chance that global output will fall below 2pc next year - the level at which we would say the world is back in recession again. However, when it comes to the eurozone, the Fund's estimates are far less sanguine. The IMF thinks there now a four in 10 chance the single currency area will slip back into its third recession since the financial crisis. via The Telegraph Euro-area growth has been largely flat for most of 2014, and a recession - defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth - remains a distinct possibility due to the continuing "fragilities" in the global economy, say the IMF. The European Central Bank has sought to revive growth and stoke inflation by slashing rates and introducing asset buying to get credit flowing back to the continent’s small businesses. But should these measures fail to improve the inflation outlook, the Bank “should be willing to do more, including purchases of sovereign debt,” say the Fund. The IMF's forecasts, like so many projections, are prone to error and revision. It was only last year that the Fund's chief economist warned George Osborne that his austerity measures were "playing with fire". And in a bout of navel gazing, the Fund has turned its attentions to its own forecasting history. They find that from 2011 to 2014, their one-year ahead estimates for growth were 0.6 percentage points too optimistic. via The Telegraph Much of these forecasting errors came from the IMF's tendency to over-shoot growth in large emerging economies such as the BRICs, and its failure to factor in the impact of the eurozone crisis three years ago. If the recent history of the Fund's outlooks shows it prone to over-optimism, its most latest predictions will leave many hoping that undue pessimism is now the order of the day. FREE AppDownload
YouTube/GunsNRosesVEVOAluminum giant Alcoa is set to report third quarter earnings after the market close on Wednesday, marking the unofficial start to third quarter earnings season. Expectations are for Alcoa to report earnings per share of $0.23 on revenue of $5.85 billion. And while Alcoa does serve as an economic bellwether due to its leadership position in the aluminum sector, earnings season will give us a wide read on the economy all the way through to about Thanksgiving.  Via FactSet, here are some key metrics to keep in mind for the S&amp;P 500 going into third quarter earnings: In a note ahead of earnings, FactSet's John Butters wrote that while the 4.2% downward revision in earnings expectations during the quarter was more than average over the last 1- and 5-year periods, it is less than the 10-year average of a 4.5% reduction in expectations.  Butters noted that, "The decline in the growth rate can be attributed in part to Bank of America, as analysts included the impact of the company’s settlement with the DOJ in their Q3 estimates."  The reduction in Bank of America's earnings expectations, to a $0.09 loss from a prior outlook for earnings of $0.32, has dragged down the financial sector's expectations for earnings growth to 10.5% from 20.6%.  The healthcare sector is the only S&amp;P 500 sector that saw earnings expectations increase during the quarter, rising to 10.6% from 9.4%.  In a note to clients on Tuesday, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Parker wrote that he sees upside to earnings season given that companies now need to clear a lowered bar.  Parker added that, "Our confidence is bolstered that earnings season will be fine as we made it through the first six days of October without any negative pre-releases. For these companies, the market is rewarding companies that beat consensus earnings and revenue estimates and is punishing misses." Parker is also focused on monitoring how the recent strength in the US dollar and the drop in the price of oil is impacting earnings statements. Additionally, Parker said he will be monitoring capital spending announcements, and expects that excluding energy and utility companies, capex-to-sales levels will at most rise only modestly.  Since second quarter earnings, we've gotten strong readings for Q2 GDP, with the latest estimate showing GDP grew 4.6% in the second quarter, while the most recent jobs report showed that payrolls gains remain solid while the unemployment rate has dipped below 6% for the first time in more than six years.  In recent weeks, the market has seen more volatility as economic news out of Europe continues to disappoint.  The market sometimes takes a breather ahead of corporate earnings season, but for the third quarter it appears we'll be digesting these reports amid already choppy waters.    FREE AppDownload

(Reuters) - Chris Gould's combine cab is loaded like the cockpit of a fighter jet he used to fly as he harvests soybeans in northern Illinois, steered by satellites, four video screens glowing with up to minute updates about his crop and the work's progress. The setup, light years from what it was when the former Navy pilot started farming nine years ago, includes technology from Monsanto and Deere &amp; Co.. But alongside them is an iPad running an app by tiny startup 640 Labs, boasting every bit as much savvy as the Goliaths' latest offerings. He is gathering inch-by-inch yield data through sensor-packed and GPS-guided equipment, aiming to pinpoint the good soil on his roughly 3,000 acre (1,214 hectare)farm, where he may plant more densely next season, and the bad, where he may plant less or fertilize more. "The goal ultimately is to customize every input to every field and zone within the field, and to have enough data and analysis tools and models to make the best farming decisions possible," Gould said. Big agriculture companies, such as Monsanto, Deere and DuPont Pioneer, have spent hundreds of millions of dollars on technologies that use detailed data on soil type, seed variety, and weather to help farmers grow more at a lower cost. But as the race for dominance on the farm heats up, a number of small tech startups are launching competing products. They are powered by many of the same data sources such as freely available rainfall totals from the National Weather Service and field boundaries gleaned from Google Maps. They also tap data gathered by farm machines and transferred via flash drive or beamed wirelessly to the cloud. Agriculture is the latest industry hoping to capitalize on Big Data, or using new technologies to gather and analyze large, complex, previously unwieldy data sets to anticipate behavior and results and boost efficiency. All hope their tools can help even the most productive farms squeeze out more grain, another 15 percent by some estimates, by telling farmers what to plant where and how densely or by informing them where to drive tractors to limit yield-sapping soil compression. Gould does not know yet which company's product he will ultimately choose. Several companies are offering basic packages for little to no cost with an eye on eventually signing farmers up for premium services such as planting prescriptions or grain marketing advice. Climate Corporation, bought by Monsanto last year for around $1 billion, is an early leader in the young market. Its free Climate Basic product used on more than 50 million acres (20.2 million hectares), or about 15 percent of total U.S. farmland. Around 1 million acres are under its premium service Climate Pro, free this year and $3 an acre next year. Among startups, Michigan-based FarmLogs has enrollments for its software product, also a free service, at around 15 percent of U.S. farms, triple what they had in January. The company, which raised $5 million in two funding rounds, declined to provide total acreage enrolled. 640 Labs, which raised nearly $3 million in its latest funding, said its subscriber base has increased four-fold since the spring but declined to disclose acreage under management. Most companies are focused on launching products in the United States, the world's largest grain producer and exporter, where detailed data on soils and weather is readily available. But they see growth opportunities in modern farming regions like South America, Australia and Europe. The industry is expected to grow fast. Monsanto called the Climate Corp acquisition its ticket to a $20 billion market. DuPont Pioneer forecast its farm data products would add $500 million to annual sales over the next decade. That growth potential and the low cost of scaling up software-as-a-service business have attracted venture capitalists like Mark Kvamme, co-founder of Drive Capital and an early investor in FarmLogs. The former Sequoia Capital partner called the startup a "disruptor," much like Google was when his former company invested in the then No. 13 search engine. "Everyone's got a computer in their pocket and connectivity to the net. You can now create software as a service, like FarmLogs has done on Amazon web services, and provide these services across the United States and across the world very efficiently," Kvamme said. But the investments in an increasingly crowded field of farm data services are not without risk. Although providers say farmers can save money on inputs like fertilizer, it remains unclear how many growers will sign up for premium services with crop prices at the lowest in more than four years. While getting their products into farmers' hands has been a challenge for start-ups that lack the reach and marketing budgets of their bigger rivals, their independence from big companies with their branded products can be a selling point. "We've very explicitly avoided partnerships with any agricultural brands that could sway us one direction or another. I don't think that's appropriate," said FarmLogs co-founder and CEO Jesse Vollmar. The ability of small firms to respond quickly to customers' requests and update products also gives them an edge. Climate Corp uses farmer feedback for product development, but the process can take up to a year or more, according to spokeswoman Christy Toedebusch. DuPont Pioneer is also open to feedback, but runs pilot trials before commercializing products, spokeswoman Jane Slusark said. In contrast, when Illinois farmer Steve Pitstick challenged 640 Labs to address production-sapping soil compaction caused by grain carts during harvest, 640 developed a method to map the cart's weight and its path through the field, helping Pitstick to minimize the damage. "Our weapon is we can turn on a dime," said 640 Labs co-founder and chief technology officer Craig Rupp. "We're very nimble." (Editing by Tomasz Janowski) FREE AppDownload
Benoit Tessier/ReutersA Bitcoin (virtual currency) paper wallet with QR codes and coins.CARACAS (Reuters) - Tech-savvy Venezuelans looking to bypass dysfunctional economic controls are turning to the bitcoin virtual currency to obtain dollars, make Internet purchases -- and launch a little subversion. Two New York-based Venezuelan brothers hope this week to start trading on the first bitcoin exchange in the socialist-run country, which already has at least several hundred bitcoin enthusiasts. Due to currency controls introduced by late president Hugo Chavez a decade ago, acquiring hard currency now means either requesting it from the state, which struggles to satisfy demand, or tapping a shadowy black market. Even small dollar transactions are out of the question for most Venezuelans. While President Nicolas Maduro makes frequent tirades against black market traders, whom he sees as part of the "economic war" on his government and the reason for inflation and shortages, he has never said anything about bitcoin. The government declined to comment on bitcoin policy. That has created a gray market for bitcoins, a digital currency which is not governed by a central bank or controlled by a single source. Bitcoin values have soared and fallen in the last year as a popular exchange, Mt. Gox, collapsed and some developed countries began to mull bitcoin regulation. In Venezuela, using bitcoins can carry a scent of subversion. "Bitcoin is a way of rebelling against the system," said one bitcoin trader, Caracas-based software developer John Villar, 32, who discovered the usefulness of bitcoin when he wanted to buy a $10 cellphone battery on Amazon. Unable to pay for it in dollars, he bought bitcoin off a friend using local currency. He then used the bitcoin to purchase an Amazon gift certificate, with which he bought the battery. Gerardo Mogollon, a business professor who styles himself as 'Dr. Bitcoin Venezuela,' speaks at conferences and appears in online videos to urge Venezuelans to adopt the currency. "I'm teaching people to use bitcoin to bypass the exchange controls," said Mogollon, a 42-year-old professor at the University of Tachira's graduate business school. Currently, bitcoin trading in Venezuela is between enthusiasts who use internet forums and social media to make ad hoc deals. Venezuela-born brothers Kevin and Victor Charles, now based in New York, are this week hoping to open the "SurBitcoin" exchange, which will match bitcoin buyers and sellers online. The price of a bitcoin price has dropped 70 percent to under $350 from a peak last November, illustrating one risk of the digital currency. But Venezuela's own bolivar currency has dropped nearly 60 percent versus the dollar on the black market here in the last year. And a black market dollar costs 16 times more bolivars than the strongest Venezuelan government rate. "Even though bitcoin is volatile, it's still safer than the national currency," said Kevin Charles, 22, who has just completed an economics degree in neighboring Colombia. Many convert the bitcoin immediately into dollars, in any case. One of the difficulties of the new exchange will be finding a supply of bitcoins. One hope is that expatriates will use the exchange to send money home, selling bitcoins for bolivars. Another answer is for Venezuelans to make their own bitcoins. There are currently more than 13 million bitcoins in existence worldwide, worth nearly $4.5 billion, according to the popular Coinbase trading platform. New bitcoins are generated by a process known as "mining", in which computers solve complex problems. Running high-end computer systems takes a lot of electricity, which is a competitive advantage for Venezuelans. Bills that could run to hundreds or thousands of dollars a month in the United States would amount to dollars for the same amount of power in Venezuela, thanks to government subsidies. In a heavily air-conditioned Caracas home, one miner surrounds himself with specialized equipment which cost thousands of dollars. He asked not to be identified for fear of theft. "In Venezuela, we have a gold fever: a bitcoin fever!" he said. (Editing by Brian Ellsworth, Andrew Cawthorne and Peter Henderson) FREE AppDownload
jurvetson / FlickrShoes that tell runners which way to turn. Bracelets that tell beachgoers which sunscreen to use. All around us, formerly inert objects are being refashioned with the capacity to connect to cyberspace. But while wearable technology for consumers might be most visible manifestation of the phenomenon known as the Internet of Things, it isn’t going to have the greatest impact on the corporate bottom line. That distinction belongs to industrial smart machines. Companies across the corporate spectrum are increasingly using equipment outfitted with sensors that connect to the Internet . The consumer and industrial goods, energy, and transportation industries, in particular, are making increasing use of sensors that transmit usage patterns, productivity levels, location, and even weather conditions. The much more complete view of operations that results allows companies to better monitor equipment use, report unusual problems, and track output, with the ultimate aim of cutting costs and improving productivity. Consider a Siemens’ plant in Amberg, Germany, that produces so-called programmable logic controllers. Smart machines connected to the Internet autonomously control 75 percent of the facility’s production, enhancing efficiency so much that there are only 12 defects per million units produced. In commercial aviation, a GE-Accenture joint venture named Taleris outfits aircraft with sensors that provide real-time information about the condition of parts. That allows the scheduling of maintenance based on actual need rather than the number of trips an aircraft has flown, thereby reducing costs and better ensuring safety. In transportation, there’s the case of NYK Logistics, which handles freight for the retailer Target at an enormous 70-acre yard in Long Beach, California. Historically, NYK used manual labor to track incoming and outgoing shipping containers, with personnel roaming the hub with clipboards and walkie-talkies, tracking inventory by scanning bar codes. When increased volumes rendered such a system untenable, NYK tapped Zebra Technologies to install a wireless tracking system known as WhereNet on the yard’s containers, trailers, dock doors and parking slots. Today, 90 percent of the yard’s equipment is automated and connected to a central database, and the company pretty much knows exactly where everything is at all times. So those are the opportunities. The challenge? Unlike the above examples, most companies haven’t figured out how to cultivate and benefit from machine-generated data. Some 95 percent of the information generated by industrial machines is “unstructured,” meaning that it isn’t organized into traditional data formats and cannot be easily crunched by the relational database software sold by the likes of Oracle, Microsoft, and IBM. And the problem is only getting worse: according to market research firm IDC, the amount of data managed by corporations will increase by a factor of 50 over the next decade. In the meantime, the machines will get smarter. Interested investors can come at the trend from several directions. Demand is fast increasing for the sensors used in smart machines, which are produced by companies such as SAP and Splunk. Industrial companies are also facing an enormous need for software that gives them the capacity to analyze and understand machine data, made by the likes of ZL Technologies, SAS and Inxight.But it’s not just those selling the sensors and the software. Indeed, the companies that are intelligently investing in their own intelligent machines are also worth a look. “You want to consider both sides,” says Michael O’Sullivan, Chief Investment Officer in Credit Suisse’s Private Banking and Wealth Management Division  “Focus on the IT companies making the software as well as in the companies who use these technologies well.” FREE AppDownload

Thomson ReutersItalian designers Roberto and Eva Cavalli acknowledge the applause after the presentation of the Roberto Cavalli Spring/Summer 2015 collection during Milan Fashion weekLONDON/MOSCOW (Reuters) - VTB Capital, the investment arm of sanctioned Russian lender VTB Bank, has made a cash payment to secure a deal to buy most of Italian fashion house Roberto Cavalli before the end of November, two sources familiar with the situation said. VTB Capital will buy a 70 percent stake in the Florentine company known for its colorful animal prints, which is valued at 400 million euros ($506.16 million), one of the sources said, adding that the cash payment was for up to 20 million euros. The sources said VTB Capital, run by Italian banker Riccardo Orcel, brother of UBS's &lt;ubsn.vx&gt; head of investment banking Andrea Orcel, was raising funds from a consortium of international investors to seal the deal quickly, before any further sanctions over Russia's role in Ukraine. They said the cash payment strengthened the chances of the deal's success because VTB Capital would lose its money if it pulled out. But the transaction could still fail in the event of another round of international sanctions over Ukraine, or if trading with Moscow worsens, one of the sources said. Another source, who could not be named because the talks are private, said the deal was already legally binding. Representatives at VTB and Cavalli declined to comment.   ITALIAN DEALS VTB wants to buy the fashion house to tap into growth markets such as Russia, the Middle East, where its opulent gowns and sand-blasted jeans have proved popular, as well as making inroads into Asia, where demand has yet to take off. The 73-year old Italian designer, known as "King Leopard" for his animal prints, confirmed plans to sell the business during Milan Fashion Week last month. "It is like selling a small piece of myself. It's not a very easy thing to do," he told reporters. Cavalli is set to retain a 30 percent stake in the company he founded in the 1960s. Previous attempts to sell a majority stake in the business, including one with private equity firm Permira [PERM.UL], had so far failed to meet a price tag based on a multiple of at least 18 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of 25 million euros. Russian interest in Italian assets, including luxury goods, fashion and food, has increased in recent months as Italy shows signs of emerging from its longest recession in 70 years. VTB Capital bought 9 percent of Milan-based M&amp;A advisory firm Eidos Partners in January in a bid to help Russian companies grab investment opportunities in Italy. It is unclear whether VTB Capital's deal for Cavalli could also involve financial backing from an alliance of Russian billionaires that have set their sights on Italian companies. Russia's top oil producer Rosneft &lt;rosn.mm&gt; acquired an indirect stake in tire maker Pirelli [PIRI.UL] earlier this year, leaving three Rosneft executives and Andrey Kostin, the chairman of VTB Bank's management board, as directors on the board of the Italian company. Meanwhile vodka tycoon Roustam Tariko purchased Italian winemaker Gancia in 2013. The Russian conglomerate Renova Group, owned by Viktor Vekselberg, took control of data specialist Octo Telematics in February.       (Additional reporting by Valentina Za in Milan; Editing by Carmel Crimmins and Louise Heavens) FREE AppDownload

Thomson ReutersA woman leaves a shopping mall in central SeoulBy Joyce Lee SEOUL (Reuters) - Already the world's biggest duty-free market, South Korea said on Wednesday it will issue more licenses for downtown duty-free shops, doubling down on a strategy that has helped it outstrip  regional rivals seeking to reel in shopaholic Chinese tourists. Seoul-based Lotte Duty Free and Hotel Shilla , part of the Samsung Group [SAGR.UL], have been adept at luring mainland China shoppers by promoting in-vogue South Korean culture - known as the "Korean wave" - and products such as cosmetics and appliances. The tactic has helped turn the pair into the world's fourth- and eighth-largest duty free retailers by sales respectively. Thanks to Chinese tourists' appetite for the luxury goods and, in particular, Korean items, South Korea overtook Britain in 2010 to become the world's largest duty-free market. In 2012, the last year for which full sales numbers are available globally, it raked in $5.86 billion in duty-free sales, or 11 percent of the global market, according to the Korea Customs Service. "Lotte and Shilla's particular strength lies in their understanding of the North Asia traveler, the Koreans naturally but more particularly the Chinese and the Japanese," said Martin Moodie, an industry expert and chairman of the Moodie Report. Korean cosmetics, he said, are "arguably the hottest category in travel retail worldwide". South Korea is enjoying a wave of popularity with Chinese tourists, with visitor numbers on track to hit 6 million this year, up 39 percent from the 4.32 million arrivals in 2013, according to the Korea Tourism Organisation.  'I CAME TO SHOP' South Korea is hardly alone in looking to attract free-spending Chinese visitors. This month, Japan extended its list of items that can be sold duty-free, including food, medicines and cosmetics. Driven by government tourism promotions of "Cool Japan" culture and a weaker yen, the number of travelers to Japan has doubled in the past decade to top 10 million for the first time last year. Japan wants to double that again to 20 million by 2020, the year of the Tokyo Olympics. In downtown Seoul on Wednesday, Wei Ci, a 24-year-old Beijing resident, scanned a row of local skincare products at the Dongwha Duty-Free Store. "I came to Korea mainly to shop," she said, explaining she planned to spend the day making the rounds of the capital's duty-free shops. Lotte Duty Free, a unit of Lotte Shopping , and Shilla have specialized in downtown duty-free shops in South Korea's bustling cities. Unlike traditional airport duty-free shops, they must generate their own tourist traffic. To do that, they engage in marketing that is more aggressive than the industry standard, staging Korean music - K-pop - concerts and fan meetings with actors and using Chinese social media such as the Weibo microblogging service. Both are now pursuing expansion overseas. Of South Korea's current 42 duty-free shops - Lotte has 8 Shilla 6 - some 17 are in city locations, including two on the holiday hotspot island of Jeju. At these locations, as in airport shops, duty-free shoppers must show a boarding pass for an upcoming flight. South Korea government officials didn't specify on Wednesday how many new licenses may be added. The matter needs to be discussed with regional authorities to gauge demand, they said. Chinese shoppers remain the biggest buyers of luxury goods worldwide, making up 29 percent of the global market, according to a report last year by Bain &amp; Company. Two-thirds of that luxury shopping takes place outside China.   (Additional reporting by Hyunjoo Jin and Sohee Kim; Editing by Tony Munroe and Kenneth Maxwell) FREE AppDownload
ABlogToWatchThe Apple Watch.The financial implosion of Apple Inc. supplier GT Advanced Technologies Inc. this week offers a dramatic illustration of how the iPhone maker can put the screws to suppliers willing to take a short-term risk for future riches. GT Advanced has offered little explanation as to what prompted its surprise bankruptcy filing on Monday. The company also did not respond to requests for comment. Analysts and industry insiders, however, attribute GT Advanced's apparent cash-flow problems to the unfavorable terms of a deal with Apple that involved building an expensive Arizona factory to make scratch-resistant sapphire glass exclusively for the Cupertino-based company, but which Apple was under no obligation to buy. Seemingly lopsided deals are common among companies vying to supply components for the hundreds of millions of iPhones and iPads that Apple sells each year. Being tapped by Apple is often Silicon Valley's equivalent of the mythical Midas Touch, as it multiplies a supplier's revenues and makes its technology more desirable to other potential customers. But the risks of being involved in the next iPhone can eclipse the rewards. Looking to potentially switch from Corning's Gorilla glass to sapphire covers on its iPhones, Apple spoke with several manufacturers who balked at the terms it was offering before it settled on GT, according to a person familiar with the matter, who declined to be named as the person was not authorized to speak to the media. One manufacturer that met with Apple walked away from the potential deal after considering the possibility that Apple would insist on even lower prices in the future, which would squeeze margins, the person said. Under the terms of the supply deal eventually struck with GT Advanced in November, Apple said it would provide GT Advanced a prepayment of about $578 million to help bankroll the Arizona factory, which would then be paid back to Apple over five years starting in 2015. The lump sum would be paid in installments contingent on GT meeting unspecified operational targets. Apple's arrangement to help finance GT Advanced's new factory is not unusual for the handset maker. In late 2011, Apple invested about $1 billion in an LCD factory operated by Japan's Sharp Corp. to make panels for the iPhone 4. The phone, however, didn't sell as well as predicted after its release in October 2012, and Sharp was forced to temporarily halt production. "Having an exclusive factory for one customer means you don't have the same reassurance as producing parts in response to demand. On the contrary, it's high risk," said a person familiar with Sharp's plans. "The volume (produced by Apple) is very high so it can bring the factory to 99 percent of capacity, but if there are no orders, then the factory will lie idle," the person said. GT Advanced The details about what happened between GT Advanced and Apple remain unclear. A person familiar with Apple's involvement in the matter said the company had worked in good faith with GT Advanced to help it meet its operational targets. Several analysts said Apple had likely made a decision that burned its supplier. Kevin Starke, analyst at CRT Capital, speculated that Apple, in forgoing sapphire glass in the iPhone 6, had effectively dealt a financial blow to GT. "We can surmise, of course, that something has gone dreadfully wrong in the company's once-promising relationship with Apple," Starke wrote in a note to clients on Monday. "We could speculate that some milestone or other requirement laid out in the operative documents has been broken or become the topic of a dispute between the parties." Industry executives and analysts said GT's bankruptcy should be a warning to companies to not hitch their future to one client. "You swallow the Apple order, but it may not taste sweet," said a person whose company supplies Apple. "It is like using Apple to build your resume. Once you supply for Apple, you use that to find more customers and you can diversify." Les Santiago, an analyst at IT consultancy IDC, said the strategy adopted by chipmakers Dialog Semiconductor, and Cirrus Logic, which get close to 80 percent of their revenue from Apple, offers an alternative to the GT story. Both firms have used their windfall from Apple to expand their product lines and expand their customer base, he said.  (Additional reporting by Edwin Chan in SAN FRANCISCO, JR Wu in TAIPEI and Sophie Knight in TOKYO; Editing by Miyoung Kim and Miral Fahmy) FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersGeneral view of Frankfurt skylineBERLIN (Reuters) - The last thing the faltering European economy would appear to need right now is a sudden downturn in Germany, hitherto the bloc's pillar of strength. But a bout of German weakness may be precisely what is required to convince Angela Merkel to loosen the fiscal reins at home and provide Europe with a dose of stimulus that struggling states like France and Italy have long been seeking. For now, the top economic priority of Merkel's government is to deliver on its promise of a "schwarze Null" - a federal budget that is in the black, or fully balanced - in 2015. That goal, spelled out in the coalition agreement struck last year between Merkel's conservatives and the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), is described by officials in Berlin as a political "holy grail" - an historic achievement that would carry huge benefits for both ruling partners if reached. It is largely due to the constraints of this budget target that Merkel has repeatedly rebuffed calls at home and abroad for Berlin to splash out more public money on infrastructure. But if the German economy, which contracted by 0.2 percent in the second quarter and may flatline in the third, continues to weaken into next year, Merkel could be forced to reverse course and step up public investment, as the European Central Bank (ECB) and International Monetary Fund (IMF) have urged. "If the only way to achieve the balanced budget goal is to make cuts that would deepen a recession, it will be abandoned and we will see more spending," said one senior German official, who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue. Another official close to the chancellor said: "If the German economy weakens substantially, that would be a game changer."   POOR DATA For now, the "schwarze Null" - or black zero - looks comfortably within reach. With unemployment still hovering near post-reunification lows under 7 percent, tax revenues continue to flow into federal coffers at record rates. Rock-bottom interest rates have sharply reduced the cost of borrowing in Germany, providing additional budget support. The Bundesbank estimates the German state saved 120 billion euros over the past seven years - including 37 billion euros last year - thanks to the drop in rates. "Of course there is a risk for the balanced budget goal if the economy weakens considerably," said Eckart Tuchtfeld, an economist at Commerzbank who focuses on budget issues. "But we don't see this as likely. Our base case is for a temporary period of economic weakness, not a prolonged recession." Still, recent German data has been unusually poor. This week industrial orders and output for the month of August posted their steepest falls since the height of the global financial crisis in 2009. The Ifo institute's closely-watched gauge of business sentiment has fallen for five straight months. And a recent survey of purchasing managers showed activity in the German manufacturing sector shrinking in September for the first time in 15 months. [ID:nL9N0Q300O] On Tuesday, the IMF slashed its 2014 growth forecast for Germany to 1.4 percent from 1.9 percent, and its 2015 forecast to 1.5 percent from 1.7. "The risks to the German economic outlook are high," said Marcel Fratzscher of the DIW economic institute in Berlin, citing weakness in the euro area, political risks in France and Italy, looming stress tests that could expose troubles at European banks, and geopolitical threats from Ukraine and the Middle East. "My expectation is that if the economy deteriorates further there will be a fundamental rethink of the German government's policy," said Fratzscher, a former ECB official who leads a panel of experts set up by Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel to study ways to boost investment. "You could see this shift very quickly," Fratzscher said. The DIW estimates that Germany is suffering from an annual investment gap of 80 billion euros after decades of declining public and private spending on domestic infrastructure and equipment. At the start of the 1990s, investment represented 23 percent of German gross domestic product (GDP). Now it is hovering around 17 percent - compared to an OECD average of 20 percent.   CRACKS Because of this, Fratzscher and other economists like Peter Bofinger, who sits on the "wisemen" council of economic advisers to the German government, believe it was a mistake for the government to set itself a balanced budget goal in the first place. It is difficult to find anyone in the government who agrees with that now. Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble has consistently rejected calls from euro zone and G20 peers to increase public spending and has instead called for measures to boost private sector investment. But there are signs of cracks in Berlin's united front. Last month, Deputy Labour Minister Joerg Asmussen penned an article with European Central Bank policymaker Benoit Coeure calling on Berlin to promote investment and cut payroll taxes in order to bolster growth in the euro zone. Asmussen returned from a spell on the ECB's Executive Board to join the coalition government last year and remains a powerful voice. Members of Gabriel's ministry are also sympathetic to the idea of more public investment and admit that the economic landscape has changed since the coalition agreed to the black zero nearly a year ago. "The commitment to a balanced budget was not a mistake given the economic circumstances at the time it was made - on the contrary it was good economics and politics," said the senior German official, who is close to Gabriel. "But the situation has changed. We now realize that we have big needs in terms of infrastructure investment and the economic environment has deteriorated."   (Editing by Mike Peacock) FREE AppDownload
Wikimedia Commons“The practice of quarantine, as we know it, began during the 14th century in an effort to protect coastal cities from plague epidemics. Ships arriving in Venice from infected ports were required to sit at anchor for 40 days before landing. This practice, called quarantine, was derived from the Italian words quaranta giorni, which mean 40 days.” (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: http://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/history quarantine.html) The modern world is now moving toward a full Ebola quarantine. I personally recall flying home from Europe in the 1960s while I was in the US Army. The plane was diverted to the Azores, and while it was refueled, the military passengers (mostly US Navy submariners) were released into the Azores for a few hours of shore leave. The commanders were not aware that a virus was loose in the Azores. When we reboarded the plane and subsequently learned of the virus, we also learned that we would be diverted once we reached the US. We had to sit on a runway in Rhode Island and wait for the US health authorities to inspect the plane. They tested everyone on it and held us while they observed whether the virus had run its course. Quarantines are a pain in the neck. They are also necessary to isolate viruses and break the chain of transmission. We see in modern countries with mature economies and functioning health systems that the use of quarantine is understood and is being implemented now in response to Ebola. The scares in Spain and Texas will ratchet up the level of quarantine. The period of 21 days will become a well-known time measurement. In Tuesday morning’s edition of The Gartman Letter, Dennis Gartman listed the assorted plagues that have claimed countless lives during the last many centuries. It is a terrific summary and helps develop perspective. We tend to focus on the isolated case and not think about the system. It is scary to watch modern media portray viral spread and resultant death. We are concerned for good reason. Smallpox, for example, ran rampant many times over the ages, and the groups above believe that perhaps several hundred million people have been killed over the eons by smallpox, with 300 million killed in the 20th century alone. In 1967, 15 million had the disease and 2 million were killed. However, effectively since 1979 there have been no outbreaks of smallpox and the disease is all but eliminated. In 1918-1919 Influenza, and specifically H1N1, commonly referred to as Spanish flu, killed 50 million people. 675,000 Americans were killed during that period. The Plague … Bubonic Plague … killed 20 million Europeans between 1340-1771, with the majority of those who died having done so between 1345-1350, with approximately one of three Europeans alive during that period having died due to the Plague. Malaria has been around for thousands of years, and only two years ago Malaria killed 1.2 million people, primarily in equatorial climates. The WHO believes that 1.8 million died during a particularly malevolent outbreak of Malaria in ’04, and we are told that 60 thousand US soldiers died of malaria in World War II. Cholera affects 3-5 million people every year according to the WHO, of which 100-120 thousand die… every year! The WHO counts seven cholera pandemics since the first in the very early 19th century. AIDS has killed 25 million people since 1981 and it killed 3.1 million in ’05 alone. The WHO estimates that there are 40.3 million people alive today suffering from HIV. Tuberculosis has been around for nearly five thousand years, and as recently as ’12 there were 8.6 million people infected with TB and 1.1 million who died from the disease in that year alone. TB raged through Europe in the 1600s, killing one of every seven people alive at the time. Typhus has been extant for nearly three thousand years, and it killed approximately 3 million people between 1918-1922 [Ed. Note: Remember, the Spanish flu was extant at that time, killing 50 million people, so between typhus and influenza, 53 million people died of diseases in those five years alone!] Here in southeastern Virginia, 3,200 people died of yellow fever in 1855, and that was of a population then of only 15,000, so 1 of every 5 people living in Norfolk, Portsmouth and Hampton died from the disease. In all, yellow fever killed 100,000 people here in the US at the time. Dennis Gartman, The Gartman Letter, 7 Oct. 2014 A historical perspective is necessary as we consider how best to address the Ebola threat. Quarantine in St. Louis, Missouri, prevented the spread of Asian Flu (H1N1) during the 1918 epidemic. In Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, there was no quarantine in effect, and the virus was deadly and spread quickly there. People felt healthy on their way into work in the morning and were dead by afternoon. We are worried about Ebola and how it will impact economic activity. It is human nature to defend ourselves and our loved ones, and quarantine is a form of self-defense. Defense against any illness, especially one that is viral, requires putting up barriers between yourself and others. Governments and businesses that have the ability to institute rules and barriers in response to Ebola will do so. At Cumberland Advisors, we ask our staff not to come to the office if they have any symptoms of illness. We install electronic equipment so that they can work from home while maintaining a personal quarantine. We believe millions of other business enterprises do the same. Ebola will shrink economic activity to some extent. The impact could be major or it could be minor, but there will be a price to pay for this virus, as there is for every natural phenomenon that has destructive characteristics. We thank Dennis Gartman for giving us permission this morning to reproduce his viral history for all to consider. We agree with Dennis: concern, caution, and quarantine are warranted. Hysteria is not. This article originally appeared at Cumberland Advisors.  Copyright 2014. FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Jacky NaegelenAir France pilots are on strikePARIS (Reuters) - Air France put the total cost of last month's two-week pilots strike at 500 million euros ($632 million) on Wednesday, wiping more than a fifth off its parent group's estimated full-year core profit. Air France-KLM &lt;airf.pa&gt;, Europe's second-biggest network carrier by revenue, had already revised down its target for 2014 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) in July from 2.5 billion euros to between 2.2 and 2.3 billion. At the time, it mainly cited overcapacity on long-haul routes and weak cargo demand. The strike has added to its woes. Air France-KLM said total passenger traffic fell 15.9 percent in September, adding that bookings for the fourth quarter were down by between 1 and 2 percentage points. The company said the 500 million euro cost estimate included a 320-350 million euro direct impact that took account of lower receipts and the purchase of tickets for customers on rival airlines, with costs partly offset by savings on fuel and other costs. The remainder was down to the delay in bookings. Chief Financial Officer Pierre-Francois Riolacci told reporters the airline had sold some 28 percent of capacity for the fourth quarter, compared with 30 percent normally at this stage of the year. "The group estimates that part of this delay could be progressively reduced over the coming weeks," the carrier said in a statement, adding that it was difficult to "quantify this adjustment exactly given the exceptional nature of the event". Pilots ended the airline's longest strike since 1998 in late September after managers agreed to drop plans to set up a new European arm for low-cost unit Transavia. Air France plans to press ahead with the expansion of Transavia France. Air France-KLM said that for the winter season, its capacity would grow by 0.7 percent, including 0.1 percent for the passenger business at its two main brands, Air France and KLM, as well as regional carrier Hop, and 13.3 percent for Transavia. In a sign of ongoing tensions in the aftermath of the dispute, Air France said it had been forced to cancel a meeting with unions on Tuesday on its plans for Transavia due to the absence of unions representing a minority of staff. "This meeting will be replaced by informal consultations with each representative union in order to deliver information on the development of Transavia," it said in a statement. Air France pilots are seeking the right for future pilots to be recruited on the same conditions as those currently working for the main airline, a point on which management says it will not give way. Shares in Air France-KLM closed down 4.6 percent on Tuesday at 6.678 euros - for a 22 percent drop since the strike began - shrugging off a decision by JPMorgan to upgrade the stock from 'underweight' to 'overweight'. Abu Dhabi's Etihad Airways said on Tuesday that it had hired Air France veteran Bruno Matheu as its chief operating officer for equity partners as it expands its global reach with acquisitions of stakes in other airlines.

REUTERS/Nigel RoddisMike Ashley.Mike Ashley, the eccentric billionaire owner of Sports Direct, appears to have Rangers Football Club, a Scottish team, over a barrel. On Wednesday, he called for chief executive Graham Wallace and director Philip Nash to step down, demanding a shareholder vote. Here is the official statement from the club. The board said it supports the pair and opposes Ashley's move. Here is why Ashley — who is so private that at one point even his own staff didn't know what he looked like (he's been called Britain's Howard Hughes) — could get his way: Rangers is so financially weak at the moment that as long as Ashley is willing to continue buying bits of it he will be able to do what he wants to the club. Ashley increased his stake in the Scottish club to almost 9% last week, and is its second-largest shareholder. Rangers' problem is that, basically, it doesn't have any money. Its most recent share offering was a failure, according to The Daily Record, and the club can't currently make its Christmas payroll: The open offer was under subscribed by just less than £800,000, meaning the club's board will now have to launch another share issue before the end of the year in order to meet December's wage bill. Ashley appears to be the only person willing to spend money on the club. He increased his stake this year but in September reminded Rangers that he was going to be capricious by declining to increase it further. "I can save you but right now I choose not to," appears to be his message to the club. He also has one other sword dangling over Ibrox Stadium: He bought the naming rights, meaning that he could rename the venerable ground "Mike Ashley's Awesome Sports Direct Bowl," or anything else he wants, whenever he wants. The Guardian reported: In September club director Sandy Easdale said that Ashley had bought the naming rights to Ibrox from the former Rangers chief executive Charles Green, telling the Daily Record: “Mike Ashley could call it the Sports Direct Arena tomorrow.” That will horrify fans, who are already threatening a boycott of Sports Direct stores. The problem is that Rangers' finances have been shaky ever since the club went bankrupt in 2011. Now it may have no choice but to bend to Ashley's will, especially if he sells his stake in Newcastle United FC to fund it. FREE AppDownload
Investors are piling into government bonds, causing yields to fall to new lows as fears over the health of the global economy grow. Government bonds are usually seen as a safe alternative to stocks, which react in a more volatile way to bad news. As bond prices rise because of the influx of new demand, the interest "yield" on top of them falls by a corresponding amount. The fact that investors are willing to pay rising prices for an instrument that pays them less and less is an indicator that fear is their motivating factor. The renewed interest in government bonds comes after the International Monetary Fund cut its global growth forecast again on Tuesday. In the latest edition of the World Economic Outlook, the Fund said it expected global growth to be 3.3% in 2014 — 0.4% lower than it predicted in April and 0.1% below what it was forecasting in July. This has helped drive pessimism over the sustainability of the global economic recovery and pushed investors to seek the perceived safe haven of government debt — even though adjusting for the impact of inflation they are losing money in doing so. Conflicts in Iraq, Syria, and Ukraine aren't helping, either. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury bond fell to 2.34% from a recent high of 2.62% on Sept. 17 as investors searched for safety once again: Bloomberg Meanwhile German government bond yields flirted with Japan-like levels as the German five-year bond matched its Japanese counterpart's yield of 0.14%. Germany five-year government bond yield: Bloomberg Japan five-year government bond yield: BloombergInvestors had been hoping the faster-growing developing world, including economic powerhouses like China, would be the drivers of the global recovery.

Thomson ReutersAngel Gurria, secretary-general of the OECD, gestures during a news conference, part of the G20 finance ministers and central bank governors' meeting, in MoscowPARIS (Reuters) - Most major world economies are continuing to show stable growth momentum, but within the euro zone Germany and Italy are losing steam, the OECD said on Wednesday. The figures from the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development added to a range of recent surveys which pointed to weakness in the euro area and came a day after the International Monetary Fund cut its global growth forecasts. The OECD said its leading indicator covering 33 member countries was stable in August from the prior month at 100.4, above its long-term average of 100. The indicator, which is designed to flag turning points in the economic cycle, suggested that the OECD area as a whole, as well as Canada and the United States individually, was experiencing "stable growth momentum." That stability was also anticipated for Brazil, Russia and China. The indicator has been close to or at 100.50 since November 2013. In the euro zone, however, signs point to weakening growth, with the indicator for Germany, Europe's biggest economy, falling to 99.7 from 100.1 in July. Official data released on Tuesday showed German industrial output plunged in August at its steepest rate since the height of the financial crisis. Signs were also emerging of a loss of growth momentum for Italy, the OECD said. For non-euro zone Britain, the outlook continues to point to stable growth with the indicator falling slightly to 100.7 from 100.8 in July. The OECD said that one-off factors might explain a fall in the indicator for Japan to 99.6 from 99.8. It said India was the only major economy whose indicator pointed to a rise in growth momentum, its indicator improving to 99.0 from 98.8.

Nobel Prize The Nobel Prize in chemistry was awarded to Eric Betzig, Stefan W. Hell, and William E. Moerner on Wednesday morning for "the development of super-resolved fluorescence microscopy." "The work of the laureates has made it possible to study molecular processes in real time," Sven Lidin, a professor at Lund University in Sweden, said in a press conference.  For a large part of the 20th century, scientists believed that optical microscopes were limited to a maximum resolution of 0.2 micrometers, or about half the wavelength of the light. This made it possible to see whole cells and parts of cells, but still impossible to make out incredibly tiny things, like single protein molecules inside living cells. Nobel PrizeErnst Abe defined the limit for optical microscopes to roughly  0.2 micrometers in 1873. Hell, Betzig, and Moerner, working independently, overcame this challenge, using fluorescent molecules to see proton resolution at much smaller scales — kind of like how a flashlight would work to illuminate where really small bits of dust are located.  Stefan Hell, from the University of Heidelberg in Germany, was the first to develop a principle that laid the foundation for a field now known as nanoscropy. In Hell's method, called stimulated emission depletion, two laser beams are used. One light pulse excites the fluorescent molecules and causes them to glow. The other light pulse blocks out all the florescence from molecules that are larger than nanometer-sized. "Scanning over the sample, nanometer for nanometer, yields an image with a resolution better than Abbe’s stipulated limit," The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences explained in a statement. (Abbe is the guy who first came up with 0.2 micrometer limit in the late 19th century).  Later, Moerner, of Stanford University, would become the world's first scientists to measure the light absorption of a single molecule. Betzig, from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in Ashburn, Virginia, would come up with a method for superimposing images, which produced an even better resolution image at the nanolevel.  In the graphic below, an image of lysosome membranes (left) taken using a traditional optical microscope is compared to the same image taken using single-molecule microscopy (center). See the difference? Nobel Prize The benefit of nanoscroy is that it enables scientists to see how cells work, meaning they can understand  disease at the cellular level and ultimately develop better treatments. A press release explains: "They can see how molecules create synapses between nerve cells in the brain; they can track proteins involved in Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s and Huntington’s diseases as they aggregate; they follow individual proteins in fertilized eggs as these divide into embryos" An amount of $1.11 million will be split equally among the Laureates.  On Tuesday, the Nobel Prize in physics was awarded to Isamu Akasaki, Hiroshi Amano, and Shuji Nakamura for inventing the blue light-emitting diode, an energy-efficient light source. On Monday, John O'Keefe and husband-wife team Edvard and May-Britt Moser split the Nobel Prize in medicine for "their discoveries of cells that constitute a positioning system in the brain."

REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton Chris Giles at the Financial Times flagged up the change. He also alerted us in April that it was all about to happen.  Basically, the method used by the IMF adjusts for purchasing power parity, explained here. The simple logic is that prices aren't the same in each country: A shirt will cost you less in Shanghai than in San Francisco, so it's not entirely reasonable to compare countries without taking this into account. Though a typical person in China earns a lot less than the typical person in the US, simply converting a Chinese salary into dollars underestimates how much purchasing power that individual, and therefore that country, might have. The Economist's Big Mac Index is a great example of these disparities. So the IMF measures both GDP in market-exchange terms and in terms of purchasing power. On the purchasing-power basis, China is overtaking the US right about now and becoming the world's biggest economy. We've just gone past that crossover on the chart below, according to the IMF. By the end of 2014, China will make up 16.48% of the world's purchasing-power adjusted GDP (or $17.632 trillion), and the US will make up just 16.28% (or $17.416 trillion): IMF, Google Public Data ExplorerAdjusted for purchasing power, China's economy is now the world's largest. IMF, Google Public Data ExplorterBut in terms of the raw market value of China's currency, it still has a long way to go.    FREE AppDownload

The Russian ruble has collapsed to a record low against a basket of dollars and euros despite intervention by the central bank to prop it up. The Russian central bank has spent as much as $1.75 billion from the country's foreign currency reserves to support the ruble, buying it on currency markets in an attempt to prop up its price, over the past three days, according to Bloomberg. But it has not halted the slide:  Twitter/Schuldensuehner The central bank has a target trading range for the strength of the ruble against the dollar and the euro (which it combines into a single figure) that, if breached, will cause it to intervene in currency markets. However, that target has been shifting in recent days due to the record falls moving from 35.50-44.50 on Friday to around 35.65-44.65 on Tuesday. The numbers represent the amount of putative rubles needed to buy dollars or euros. The central bank is due to officially review the range again today. So far, burning through more of the country's reserves has done little to support the currency as grim economic forecasts, sliding oil prices, rising inflation and sanctions over the crisis in Ukraine have all taken their toll. Investors are selling their rubles for other currencies because they don't like those risks. With Russia currently holding over $400 billion in foreign currency reserves, however, this game of chicken with currency markets — in which investors sell the ruble while Russia buys it in hopes of staving off further collapse — is likely to continue.

NOAA				 Super Typhoon Vongfong is now the strongest Pacific typhoon this year, packing estimated maximum winds of 180 mph, the equivalent to a Category 5 hurricane, The Weather Channel reports.  The storm is projected to move across the western Pacific Ocean and track north toward Japan before making landfall later this week.  "It's safe to say Vongfong is the strongest storm on earth since Haiyan last year," The Weather Channel storm specialist Michael Lowry told the website.  As of 10 p.m. ET, a National Weather Service bulletin said Super Typhoon Vongfong was centered 910 miles west-northwest of Guam and moving west-northwest at 12 mph, bringing heavy rain within 300 miles of the center. The storm is expected to intensify throughout the day, reaching its peak Wednesday night, before winding down Thursday, the weather service said.  A super typhoon is the most intense tropical cyclone. The system is classified as a super typhoon once it reaches Category 4 hurricane status with sustained winds of 130 mph or above.  FREE AppDownload

Wikipedia(Reuters) - Security software maker Symantec Corp is in advanced talks to split its business into two entities - one that sells security programs and another that does data storage, Bloomberg reported, citing people with knowledge of the matter. An announcement may be a few weeks away, according to Bloomberg. (http://bloom.bg/1uzhJyc) Symantec declined to comment on the report. "The company does not comment on rumors," Symantec spokeswoman Kristen Batch told Reuters in an email. Reuters reported in April that Symantec, the biggest U.S. security software maker, was in the process of hiring banks to help advise on strategy and defend against possible activist investors. Private equity firms were also looking at the possibility of breaking up Symantec into smaller pieces, some of which may also be attractive to industry peers, sources told Reuters at that time. A breakup may position Symantec's separated businesses as acquisition targets, given that large companies including EMC Corp and Hewlett-Packard Co are interested in the stand-alone security business or in an independent storage business, Bloomberg reported. Earlier this year, the company, known for its Norton antivirus software, abruptly fired its CEO as it struggles to revive growth amid eroding PC sales. Symantec, which also offers data storage products, has seen revenue growth turn negative in recent quarters, unlike the rest of the security software market, which is growing at least 10 percent to 15 percent annually. The slowdown is partly due to eroding PC sales, affecting demand for its software, which often comes bundled with new computers. It has failed to gain a strong footing in the market for mobile security. If it goes ahead with the breakup, Symantec would join technology companies that are spinning off operations in an attempt to become more agile and capitalize on faster-growing businesses. HP said earlier this week that it would split into two listed companies, separating its computer and printer businesses from its faster-growing corporate hardware and services operations. Online auction company eBay Inc said last week it would spin off electronic payment service PayPal.   (Reporting by Supriya Kurane in Bangalore; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier) FREE AppDownload
