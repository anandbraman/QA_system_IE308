REUTERS/Yves HermanLuxembourg's Prime Minister Xavier Bettel holds a news conference after a European Union leaders summit in Brussels March 21, 2014.(Reuters) - More than 300 companies, including PepsiCo Inc, AIG Inc and Deutsche Bank AG, secured secret deals from Luxembourg to slash their tax bills, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) reported, quoting leaked documents. The companies appear to have channeled hundreds of billions of dollars through Luxembourg and saved billions of dollars in taxes, the group of investigative journalists said, based on a review of nearly 28,000 pages of confidential documents. The leaked documents reviewed by ICIJ journalists include hundreds of private tax rulings – known as comfort letters – that Luxembourg provides to corporations seeking favorable tax treatment. Luxembourg officials denied any "sweetheart deals" in its tax system. "The Luxembourg system of taxation is competitive – there is nothing unfair or unethical about it," ICIJ quoted Nicolas Mackel, chief executive of Luxembourg for Finance, as saying in an interview. Pepsi, AIG and Deutsche Bank were not immediately available for comment. EU state aid regulators are investigating Amazon's tax deals with Luxembourg, saying the arrangements could have underestimated the U.S. online retailer's profits and given it an unfair advantage, Reuters reported in October.

Jordan Strauss / StringerA bit irritated.After Tesla reported earnings on Wednesday, beating Wall Street expectations with a modest $0.02 profit, CEO Elon Musk took questions from analysts. In the wake of a debate about whether Tesla will be able to meet 2014 sales targets, Musk was clearly irritated. Tesla reported on Wednesday that it will sell a total of 33,000 Model S sedans, its only vehicle, versus an earlier expectation of 35,000. Analysts and media outlets have begun to address a possible decline in demand for the Model S. Musk tried to further clarify a point that he made on Tesla's second quarter earnings call, when he insisted that Tesla doesn't have a demand problem.  "It's not a question of demand," he said. "Demand is not our issue, production is our issue. We have more demand than we can address and levers we can pull to increase demand, and we’re not doing it." Musk's point was that if Tesla engaged in conventional advertising strategies — the company currently does almost no advertising — it could increase demand, but its more pressing issue now is being able to simply built its cars, and build them well. "It's worth saying that making one of something is quite easy," Musk said. "Making lots of something consistently that's going to last a long time is extremely hard. In fact, it is way harder to make the machine that makes the machine that it is to make the machine in the first place." Musk is also ticked off that the battery industry doesn't hold itself to a high standard of truthfulness (Tesla is preparing to construct a massive $5-billion battery factory in Nevada). "The battery industry has to have more B.S. in it than any industry I’ve ever seen," he said. "We're not worried about blindsided on a technology." Musk is usually very forthcoming about Tesla's business on earnings calls, and Wednesday's call was no exception, but throughout he seemed annoyed and at times confrontational that the market and the media have fixated on speculation that Tesla is running out of customers. Again and again, he insisted that Tesla could stoke demand if it wanted to — but isn't. His testiness clearly stemmed from the same group of analysts he told this to last quarter revisiting the issue again.  From his perspective, the bottom line is that Tesla has people lining up to buy its existing cars and expects to have people lining up to buy its new cars and is far more worried about being able to build the vehicles and properly support them than it is about seeing demand drop off. He also anticipated production growth rates of 50% from 2014 to 2015 and admitted that Tesla could "do better" on being less perfectionistic with future cars.    FREE AppDownload
The euro zone economy hasn’t exactly been a fount of good news lately. Yes, funding rates for banks have eased, business activity picked up slightly in October and the currency has weakened against the dollar, favoring exporters. But that’s pretty much it. The truth of the matter is that despite a plethora of easing measures announced in recent months by the European Central Bank, the regional economy is proving stubbornly anemic. New orders, employment and prices are in decline. The economy stalled in the second quarter as the German economy shrank, and the Purchasing Managers’ Index suggests the euro zone only grew 0.2 percent in the third quarter. And so we’re back where we seem to find ourselves every few months, with all eyes on ECB president Mario Draghi, and the next central bank meeting on November 6. What are his options? One thing he can do, says Credit Suisse analyst Christel Aranda-Hassel, is to put the “Q” in quantitative easing. Unlike the free-spending Federal Reserve, the ECB has taken a more conservative and passive role in regard to the size of its balance sheet. But when Draghi announced in September that the ECB was ready and willing to start purchasing asset-backed securities and covered bonds, he also suggested the bank could expand its balance sheet by €1 trillion – a 50% increase over current levels of just over €2 trillion, and right back to its early 2012 size of €3 trillion-plus. The bank also pledged to become a more active manager of that balance sheet. “[We] are starting a transition from a monetary policy framework predominantly founded on passive provision of central bank credit to a more active and controlled management of our balance sheet,” Draghi said on September 22. The hoped-for effect of such a move is to encourage lending, giving a further jolt to the economy as well as inflation. One thing it will almost certainly do is keep the currency weak. The problem, writes Aranda-Hassel in an October 24 report entitled “Size Matters”, is the ECB is going to find it quite difficult to get to that  €3 trillion balance sheet if it’s limited to the measures it’s announced so far. The bank’s targeted longer-term refinancing operations have so far fallen short of analysts’ expectations, with lenders borrowing just €82.6 billion at the first auction in September. While it did resume buying covered bonds on October 20, the last such program pulled in only €17 billion worth. And purchases of asset-backed securities stand to add “tens rather than hundreds of thousands” to the balance sheet, according to Aranda-Hassel. If the bank really wants to use its balance sheet effectively, says Aranda-Hassel, it should consider making sovereign bond purchases à la Federal Reserve. In doing so, she says, the ECB could have real – and sizeable – impact: the euro area has more than 6 trillion euros worth of eligible government bonds, according to Credit Suisse. Short of that, however, the smaller, more incremental moves aren’t likely to arrest the decline in economic numbers. In December, the ECB is expected to lower its 2014 forecast from 0.9% and cut its 2015 forecast sharply from 1.6% to nearer 1%, according to Credit Suisse. Meanwhile, euro zone inflation fell to a five-year low of 0.3 percent in September and looks likely to remain below 1 percent in 2015. “It makes little sense to us to delay a swifter balance sheet expansion,” Aranda-Hassel writes. And what of the region’s banks? They might just be ready for some balance sheet expansion themselves, albeit after a little more bookkeeping of their own. According to results of the nearly year-long asset quality review and stress tests of euro area banks released on Sunday, the ECB identified an extra €136 billion in non-performing assets on banks’ books, an 18 percent increase, and suggested that banks had overinflated the value of their assets by €47.5 billion. Taken as a whole, though, Credit Suisse analysts saw the stress tests results as good news not only for the European banking sector, where equity analysts maintain an overweight that has been in place since July 2013, but also for future economic growth. Only 25 of 123 banks failed the tests and, surprisingly, not a single one of 15 Spanish banks is facing a capital shortfall. “The results remove concerns about balance sheets and allow the managers of most of Europe’s banks to get on with the process of lending,” says Michael O’Sullivan, Credit Suisse’s chief investment officer for the U.K., Europe, Middle East and Africa. For Draghi, that’s welcome news. Given the shape the economy is in, he needs all the help he can get. FREE AppDownload
Hannelore Foerster/Getty ImagesOn Thursday, the European Central Bank will announce its latest monetary policy decision at 12:45 p.m. GMT. The meeting will be followed by a press conference with ECB President Mario Draghi at 1:39 p.m. GMT. Here's what been going on since the big meeting, and what to expect for tomorrow. The headline measure of inflation rose to 0.4% in October, up from 0.3%. That gives the ECB a little more room to breathe. For the last four months, inflation has been at either 0.4% or 0.3%, so concerns about a deflationary spiral might look a little less likely. But the ECB's target for inflation is 2%, which it's still nowhere near meeting. As the graph below shows, though headline inflation ticked up a tiny amount, core inflation which strips out volatile items like food, is at a joint-record low. Oxford Economics The European Commission's latest forecasts are now out, and they are worse than the ECB's previous forecasts. The Commission expects: For the ECB's price stability mandate, inflation is the most important of these three. The European Commission is expecting it to converge, and stay at a low level: European Commission Draghi and the rest of the ECB have made it clear that they are able to look through short-term factors driving down inflation: in the summer, they talked repeatedly about downward pressure on energy prices, which didn't necessarily merit more easing and (they thought) would dissipate.  But they've also talked about the importance of keeping inflation expectations well anchored. It's clear that they're not, and increasingly markets and forecasters are not expecting inflation to return to target any time soon. In mid-October, the New York Times published a snippet from leaked ECB minutes detailing a disagreement between Jens Weidmann, head of the Bundesbank, and the rest of the governing council. The minutes are not meant to be released until 30 years after the meeting. There have also been a bunch of articles citing ECB sources on the souring relationship between Draghi and Weidmann, especially over the possibility that the eurozone will have to go for full-blown quantitative easing. This culminated yesterday with another Reuters piece suggesting that a set of central bankers representing some of the eurozone's nations are going to challenge Draghi. The piece included allegations that he didn't talk to other monetary policymakers about his latest promise on the ECB's balance sheet or about some parts of his Jackson Hole speech. This is a huge problem for at least two reasons. First, when Draghi speaks, most people seem to think he's talking for the ECB. But he's not allowed to make decisions on his own. So if investors start to think that isn't true, his interventions will have much less market impact. Secondly, expect the markets to react badly if there's really a concerted campaign to get rid of Draghi. Though the ECB's policy is often derided, it's not usually thought to be his fault, and there's a massive risk that someone more inactive or hawkish could get the post. Kit Juckes at Societe Generale:  'Words. Words, I'm so sick of words...show me!' sings Eliza Doolittle in ‘My fair Lady'. Ignoring the context, the emotion is familiar to ECB-watchers. We don't want words, promises, or assurances, we want action. Unfortunately,Thursday's meeting will be another fine display of verbal reassurance from Mario Draghi with no new policies on offer. Contrast that with the BOJ's Haruhiko Kuroda - the market's new ‘Man of Action'. Ben May at Oxford Economics: Draghi will have to tread carefully at the press conference. While he will not want to say anything that may raise the pressure on the ECB to take further imminent action, neither will he want to do anything to reverse the favourable exchange rate and bond yield movements of recent months. On balance, we expect there to be little change in the language that Draghi adopts on Thursday. And we still hold the view that the ECB will not undertake sovereign QE and markets are overestimating the likely probability of such action. Marchel Alexandrovich at Jefferies International: With inflation and GDP growth both close to zero, it would be surprising if Draghi was anything but dovish at the upcoming ECB press conference. However, given that the easing measures announced over the past several months are yet to be fully implemented, we expect Thursday’s focus to be on positioning the markets for December. Analysts at Nomura, Lloyds, Wells Fargo and Daiwa Capital Markets agree: dovish cooing, but no solid action from the ECB this month. FREE AppDownload

Rome Lazarus/US Marine CorpsFA Insights is a daily newsletter from Business Insider that delivers the top news and commentary for financial advisers.  Bob Doll: Energy And Defense Stocks Might Win Big Following The Election Results (Investment News) Bob Doll, of Nuveen Investments, doesn't think that Tuesday's election was a "game changer" per se. However, he does think that the results could benefit several stocks. Now that the Republicans have taken control of Congress, "faster adoption of liquefied natural gas exports from the United States is likely to be on [their] radar screens, and this development would be a positive for the energy sector," writes Bob Doll. "Additionally, the GOP will probably push for increased defense spending, which could benefit companies in that industry." The Upcoming Rates Rise May Cause Bond Market Liquidity To Shrink (Charles Schwab) The structural changes in the bond market, combined with the upcoming possible Fed rate hike, may cause too many investors to sell their bonds at the same time — which will disrupt the market liquidity. As a result, now investors should "take liquidity into consideration in [their] income investments" and "focus on time horizons," writes Kathy A. Jones. Additionally, investors need to look at the level of cash in their bond funds, because those that hold large amounts of cash may underperform in the market. And finally, investors should "try to avoid selling during major liquidity events" and "understand the level of volatility [they] are willing to bear when investing in the various sectors of the fixed income markets before a market even occurs," writes Jones. Donor-Advised Funds Are A Good Idea For Clients Who Want To Spread Their Donations Around (Financial Planning) It's pretty simple when a wealthy client wants to give a large chunk of money to one organization. But that's not always the case: Sometimes wealthy clients want to divide up their wealth for multiple groups. In such cases, advisers should consider a donor-advised fund, or DAF. With a DAF, the client makes "a single charitable gift of assets to a donor advised fund; many organizations and financial firms sponsor such an entity. Then the donor can have the fund send money to as many charities as the client likes," according to Donald Jay Korn. The Overseas Stimulus' Suggest That The Dollar Will Stay Dominant In The Near Future (BlackRock Blog) The dollar is strong right now, but that's not only because of a strong US economy. In actuality, the dollar's relative strength is, in part, due to the global economy's relative weakness. Former economic powerhouses in Japan and Europe are struggling, so much so that their central banks need to ease monetary policy. "For now we continue to expect a world in which US growth overshadows that of other developed countries, resulting in a strong dollar and weaker commodity prices. However, this situation could in turn lead to extraordinary stimulus measures by other central banks which, in turn, could benefit their stock markets," writes Russ Koesterich. Despite all the bad overseas news, BlackRock remains bullish on Japanese stocks because they "should enjoy the tailwind of aggressive monetary policy" by the Bank of Japan in the same way that the US has been buffered by the Fed in recent years. Machine-Based Learning Is Going To Change How Investors View A Company's Potential (AllianceBernstein) Companies — whether they're as big as Google or just a small entrepreneurial firm — are increasingly starting to adopt machine-based learning. And that has implications for inventors because they will have to value companies in a different way. "This technological shift is changing how investors gauge a company's potential in terms of its intellectual property," argues Benjamin Ruegsegger. In the past, investors would look at a company's patent portfolio, but now they should look at "how many machine learning experts are on staff" because "more talents leads to better products and smarter capital spending."

This is one of the times where the hype is all true: asking her to marry you probably will be the most important moment of your life. For many of the guys I know, it was equal parts incredibly amazing and astronomically stressful. Deep breath: Let me take you by the hand through some of the bigger issues.    Erie Basin via The Style Girlfriend   FIRST THINGS FIRST: KNOW THE RULES SO YOU CAN BREAK THEM Thanks to—obviously—the diamond industry and our favorite national mall jewelry stores, we all have a pretty good idea of what’s required from an engagement ring: It doesn’t count unless it’s a brand-new diamond, and it won’t even register unless it cost two (or three) months’ salary. Beyond the fact that to me, this all sounds as old-fashioned as a dowry of, like, 100 head of Highland cows, let’s crunch some numbers: Call me a grinch but I’m not even sure I want to own something (a) that costs $12,000 and (b) can fall down a sink. I’ll leave the bottom line to Lindy of PenelliBelle, who makes custom and other engagement rings: “If you are super in love, your lady would be just as happy with a string around her finger, so do not break the bank, guys.” Erie BasinVintage 1920s Art Deco ring, $4750 You wouldn’t walk onto a used car lot without a thorough Blue Book investigation—equally, you’ll want to bone up on your diamond knowledge before diving into the world of engagement rings. Diamonds have four chief characteristics that determine their price: Any of these factors can hugely influence your cash outlay. As no less an authority than the Gemalogical Institute of America points out, the price difference between a diamond that’s .99 carats and 1 carat can be substantial while also being nearly impossible to visually discern. Have you torn your hair out yet? No? Good, let’s keep going. The carats will largely be determined by your budget. Clarity can actually be a question of taste—while diamonds with a higher degree of clarity are typically more sought-after (and so more expensive), some jewelers enjoy working inclusions (interior flaws) or blemishes (external ones), though generally with stones other than diamonds. (For more information on this, I strongly recommend playing around with the GIA’s clarity slider, which shows a range of diamonds with various flaws.) Cut and color are really issues of taste. In terms of color, diamonds are graded on a scale of D (practically colorless, incredibly rare) to Z. (Some stores, like Blue Nile, won’t stock diamonds below a grade of J.) But some ladies don’t mind a touch of yellow in her stones—who’s to say that “colorless” is intrinsically better, unless you’re just looking for an indicator of cost? Cut—cut can really make someone insane. Officially, “cut” isn’t precisely the same thing as “style”, but the two are often used interchangeably, so let’s keep going, shall we? Cut actually indicates how well the diamond is (yes) cut to maximize its sparkle. Any style—round, emerald, pear, princess, etc.—can be cut well or poorly. But in terms of the style: If you don’t know her aesthetic, I promise: There are clues out there, somewhere. “Find little ways to see what she likes,” Lindy says. “Definitely ask best friends. Usually guys are snooping on their lady’s favorite lists on Etsy and Pinterest and other social media in order to surprise them.” You also might want to consider involving her in the design process: “We are also seeing many couples work on the ring together,” she says. Erie BasinVintage 1920s Art Deco ring, $1550 Diamonds are now recovering from some bad publicity, the result of global concerns about a stone’s pedigree. Diamonds are mined in many parts of the world, including countries where their sale has subsidized war and conflict, including Sierra Leone, Congo, and Ivory Coast. Many retailers try to guarantee conflict-free diamonds, though some organizations, like Amnesty International, have expressed concern about how successful these policies are. It’s possible to skirt this problem entirely. One way is to go vintage. “I have seen a big shift in people’s attitudes towards diamonds over the years,” says Russell Whitmore, owner and curator of Brooklyn’s Erie Basin, which regularly stocks vintage engagement rings. “I used to hear ‘anything but a diamond’ a lot back when we first opened, either because of ethical or aesthetic reasons,” Whitmore says. “Now I rarely hear anyone asking for anything but a diamond. I also think that diamonds and the idea of a ‘traditional’ engagement ring are really back in style. We have always stocked a lot of non-conventional-looking engagement rings, but there’s very high demand for classic solitaires, like the ones that Tiffany introduced in the 1880s.”    Erie BasinVintage 1930s diamond in new mounting, $3350   Non-diamond stones are also totally viable—perhaps a birth stone. “Couples are tending to want something unique and special—’Everyone has diamonds’ is what we often hear,” Lindy says. (Does anyone actually think a man is less in love if he goes for yellow quartzover a diamond?) Working with an independent designer (there are 108,603 search results for “engagement rings” on Etsy) can provide financial benefits for the buyer beyond the sticker price, like a willingness to include customizations at low or no charge. “Customization is usually very difficult in the [chain] stores and if they do it, it is very costly,” Lindy says. “For me, custom work is very fulfilling. I can create anything and ensure the couple gets exactly what they want.” FREE AppDownload
 Whole Foods is expanding and expects sales to increase by 9% next year.  The company's shares soared on the news that it is planning to build more stores and update its loyalty program and mobile app.  Whole Foods has 401 locations right now and will expand to more than 500 by 2017. The company is also launching online ordering and delivery.  But as the organic grocery thrives, traditional supermarkets are losing market share. Customers are seeking either specialty assortments or great value, according to a recent report by the real-estate investment firm JLL.  While high-end grocers like Whole Foods and cheap retailers like Family Dollar will expand in the coming years, traditional grocery stores like Kroger, Giant Eagle, and Publix could close stores.  Supermarkets are hit hard by a few trends, according to the report.  Since the 2008 recession, consumers have been reluctant to pay full price. This led to dollar stores expanding their food assortments to include brand names.  Those who do want to pay more want the organic, artisanal assortments grocers like Whole Foods have to offer.  "Millennials and boomers alike are focusing more on healthy eating choices and creatively prepared meals," the analysts wrote.  This puts grocery stores, which fall somewhere between organic retailers and discounters, in a difficult position.  JLL Alternative retailers are taking market share from grocery stores. Consumers are also buying groceries from several different places, including online.  This gives smaller and specialty retailers an advantage over supermarkets.  Consumers are also becoming less interested in retailers like Wal-Mart and Target, according to a recent note by Goldman Sachs.  Instead, "consumers appear more focused on some combination of value and convenience," the analysts write.  The advent of online retailers like Amazon has also contributed to the problems at Wal-Mart and Target, according to the note. Consumers are less likely to make a trip to the stores when they could get free delivery online.  Dollar stores, drug stores, and warehouse clubs "are taking share from broad-assortment retailers," the analysts write.      FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Lucy NicholsonA man looks at his phone as he walks out of the courthouse past a man arranging his bags in Los Angeles, California.Income inequality in America is an endlessly fascinating, albeit depressing, topic. But American cities have varying levels of inequality. The Census Bureau makes annual estimates of a standard measure of inequality for US metropolitan areas. The Gini index is a measure, ranging between 0 and 1, of inequality. The Gini index measures how much the distribution of income or wealth in an area differs from a completely equal distribution. A Gini index of 0 indicates that everyone has the same income; an index of 1 means one person has all the money and everyone else has nothing. We ranked 382 metropolitan areas with populations of at least 65,000 using Census estimates from the 2013 American Community Survey, and found the 18 areas with the highest Gini indices. We also included the income shares of the ends of the distribution: the top 5% and the bottom 20%, also from the Census Bureau. FREE AppDownload
Earnings are arguably the most important driver of stock prices. So its a bit jarring to see stock prices and earnings diverge in the European equity markets. There's a lot going on in Europe. The European economy is flagging. In the second quarter, GDP growth in the Eurozone was an anemic 0.1%, while inflation remains at a tepid 0.4% pace. This has created a conundrum for policy makers, notably European Central Bank president Mario Draghi, who has tried to implement policies to spur growth and inflation. So far, however, Draghi has so far come up short of a full US or Japanese-style quantitative easing program. The ECB will announce its latest policy decision on Thursday. And while stocks in Europe haven’t had a great year, stock prices are still outpacing earnings gains. In our latest Most Important Charts in the World series, Claus Vistesen, chief Eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, submitted the following chart, asking the simple, and yet not easily answerable question: where are the Eurozone earnings? "The debate on European equities ranges is extremely volatile," Vistesen writes, "ranging from 'they are very cheap and a screaming buy,' to 'Oh my god, Europe is turning Japanese.'" The irony, of course, is that investors may well want to see Europe, at least from a monetary policy perspective "turn Japanese.' A popular investment thesis right now is being short the euro and long European equities, akin to the position taken by investors in late 2012 when the most popular trade in the world was to be short the Japanese yen and long Japanese equities. The thinking here is that if the ECB engages in a QE program that includes the outright purchase of European sovereign debt, the value of the euro will fall and European stocks will rise. But Vistesen notes that the divergence between earnings and price is the kind of action that smacks of central bank intervention, and this is already showing up in European stock prices. "There is a big gap between price and earnings growth, which will now either be filled with higher earnings growth or lower prices." Or is there a third path forward for European stocks?

 Tesla just reported third-quarter earnings.  The electric car maker reported a small profit of $3 million which translates to roughly $0.02 per share of its stock. Analysts expected a loss of 1 cent per share, against a gain of 12 cents for the same period last year. Tesla stock is up almost 7.4% in after hours trading. All eyes are on Tesla sales. The company had expected to sell 35,000 cars worldwide and over 17,000 in the US in 2014. However, Tesla reported that 2014 sales would come in at 33,000, but that the company would still be able to manufacture 35,000 cars for the year. The gap of 2,000 vehicles is something Tesla had earlier indicated would show up in the third quarter. In other words, the company won't be able to deliver 2,000 of the cars it manufactured this year.  The issue of production and sales for 2014 being out of sync is something that Tesla has addressed.  It expects this issue to be resolved in 2015, as the company's plant in California adjusts to higher Model S production levels and the rollout of the Model X SUV, now expected to hit the market in the third quarter of 2015. Today's report is welcome news to Tesla's investors. There is immense pressure on the company to deli ever on all of the promise it has shone over the years. With share of its stock up a staggering 1,000% since its 2010 IPO, investors are clamoring to see the financial and sales figures that justify its stock value.

 Whole Foods shares are up 7% in after-market trading after the company released a positive outlook for the future.  The company's fourth-quarter earnings per share were $0.35, compared with analyst estimates of $0.32. Same-store sales rose 3.1%, and the company reported that it expected sales to grow up to 9% in 2015.  The company has been challenged by competitors including Trader Joe's and Wal-Mart in recent years.  But executives expect expansion efforts, innovations to its mobile app, and a new loyalty program to drive sales.  Here's the full earnings report:  AUSTIN, Texas, Nov. 5, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Whole Foods Market, Inc. (WFM) today reported results for the 12-week fourth quarter and 52-week fiscal year ended September 28, 2014. Q4 Highlights: During the quarter, the Company produced $229 million in cash flow from operations and invested $185 million in capital expenditures, resulting in free cash flow of $44 million. In addition, the Company returned $44 million in quarterly dividends to shareholders and repurchased $100 million of common stock, or 2.6 million shares. The Company ended the quarter with total cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and investments of approximately $1.0 billion. "We are pleased with our quarterly and fiscal year results which reflect continued market share gains, record EBITDA, and healthy returns on invested capital," said John Mackey, co-founder and co-chief executive officer of Whole Foods Market. &amp;quot;The last few months have been an incredibly exciting and rewarding time for our company as we opened a record number of new stores and launched several strategic initiatives, expanding choices for our customers and reinforcing our values as America's Healthiest Grocery Store. Collectively, our efforts have led to extremely high team member morale, heightened brand visibility and positive sales momentum." "Natural and organic products are increasingly available, yet no one offers the shopping experience we offer. We hold the idea of 'food' to a higher standard, banning more than 75 ingredients commonly found in other stores, and we believe our unparalleled quality standards are a large part of why we maintain a broad base of loyal customers and attract new customers aspiring to a natural and organic lifestyle," said Walter Robb, co-chief executive officer of Whole Foods Market.  &amp;quot;As we accelerate our growth, we are evolving and differentiating our shopping experience faster than ever before.  Our leadership in retail innovation is one of our many competitive advantages, and it is exciting to see our new stores from Palm Desert, California to Toronto, Canada perform so well." The following table provides the Company's comparable and identical store sales results for the fourth quarter and for the first five weeks of the 16-week first quarter. Companies may define comparable and identical store sales differently; thus, growth rates across companies may not be comparable. Gross margin declined 20 basis points to 35.4% due primarily to a LIFO charge of $5 million and higher cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales, partially offset by leverage in occupancy costs. Direct store expenses improved 21 basis points to 25.2% of sales due primarily to leverage in salaries and benefits. As a result, store contribution was 10.3% of sales, in line with last year's record result. Additional information for the quarter for comparable stores is provided in the following table.  The Company does not intend to publish this level of detail on a quarterly basis past fiscal year 2014. The Company notes that quarter-to-quarter changes in results by age category are typically attributable to stores shifting between categories.  In the fourth quarter, the less-than-two-year-old category included the fewest number of stores and was materially impacted by a decrease in sales from relocated stores, along with an increase in the number of stores experiencing the "J-curve" effect (cycling over high opening sales volumes). For the first five weeks of the first quarter, comparable store sales growth in this category has returned to double digits. The Board of Directors today declared an increase in the Company's quarterly dividend to $0.13 per share from $0.12 per share, representing an annual return to shareholders of approximately $188 million. The next dividend is payable on January 27, 2015 to shareholders of record as of January 16, 2015. Fiscal Year Highlights: Additional information for the fiscal year for comparable stores is provided in the following table. Growth and Development In the fourth quarter, the Company opened a record 13 new stores, expanding into seven new markets. The opening schedule was back-end loaded, with nine of the 13 stores open for one month or less in the fourth quarter; on a weighted basis, the year-over-year increase in square footage was 8%. So far in the first quarter, the Company has opened three new stores, including one relocation, and expects to open six additional stores. The Company currently has 401 stores totaling approximately 15 million square feet and expects to cross the 500-store mark in fiscal year 2017. Longer term, the Company sees demand for 1,200 Whole Foods Market stores in the United States. The Company recently signed 12 new leases, including one relocation. These leases include three new markets and are located in Hoover, AL; Tempe, AZ;Santa Clara, CA; Denver, CO; Destin, FL; Towson, MD; Woodbury, MN;Lancaster, PA; Newtown Square, PA; El Paso, TX; Las Colinas, TX; andSeattle, WA. With the beginning of the new fiscal year, the Company is taking the opportunity to shift its conversations with the investment community. Consistent with its stakeholder philosophy, the Company is focusing on a broader directional point of view and metrics it believes are key to the long-term health of the Company. In addition, the Company is not planning to provide regular quarterly updates to its annual targets, which for fiscal year 2015 are:Fiscal Year 2015 Targets The Company expects to continue its value strategy and to make additional investments in areas such as technology, marketing, and new and existing stores. The Company believes this is the right strategy to drive sales growth over the longer term. Reflecting its ongoing value efforts, the Company expects a greater decline in gross margin, excluding LIFO, in fiscal year 2015 than in fiscal year 2014. The Company expects to maintain expense discipline and improve its cost structure, with the biggest savings coming from internal distribution, coordinated purchasing and labor leverage. For fiscal year 2015, the Company expects annual diluted earnings per share growth in line with or slightly higher than sales growth. The Company expects store openings to be spread fairly evenly throughout the year, with the seven former Dominick's locations re-opening as Whole Foods Market stores in the last three quarters of the year. The Company notes that average weekly sales and gross profit as a percentage of sales are typically highest in the second and third fiscal quarters, and lowest in the fourth fiscal quarter due to seasonally slower sales during the summer months. Gross profit as a percentage of sales is also lower in the first fiscal quarter due to the product mix of holiday sales. The Company also notes that Easter will fall in the second quarter of fiscal year 2015 versus the third quarter of fiscal year 2014, positively impacting comparable store sales growth in the second quarter and negatively impacting comparable store sales growth in the third quarter by an estimated 50 to 60 basis points.

"The job market is steadily picking up pace," Moody's Analytics' Mark Zandi noted. "Job growth is strong and broad-based across industries and company sizes.

OKLAHOMA CITY (Reuters) - During the divorce trial of oil baron Harold Hamm and wife Sue Ann, an unusual relationship took shape in the Oklahoma courtroom as the marriage was being dismantled. From the bench, Special Judge Howard Haralson playfully tossed red and white peppermints to a lawyer sitting alone in the jury box who didn't represent either of the Hamms in the case. The man, Eric Eissenstat, serves as general counsel, senior vice president, secretary and chief risk officer for Continental Resources, the publicly traded oil company founded and run by Harold. And during a trial that could result in one of the largest divorce judgments in U.S. history, Eissenstat emerged as one of the most important people in the courtroom. For all but a few hours of testimony in the nine-week trial, the proceedings were closed to the public and to the media – a practice atypical in divorce cases that don't involve child custody disputes. But interviews with a half-dozen people who were present in the courtroom, and with others familiar with the case, indicate that Eissenstat played an extraordinary role throughout the trial: On several occasions, Eissenstat, 56, passed through the judge's chambers or into a court staff room and engaged the judge and his staff in conversations, said Haralson's bailiff, Jessica Rodriguez. The conversations were “general chitchat,” Rodriguez said. “We're all pretty friendly around here.” In a statement, Continental said Eissenstat “did not speak privately with Judge Haralson in his chambers, and his relationship with Judge Haralson is professional and no different than the other individuals present in his courtroom.” To at least one witness, Eissenstat, a tall, slim career litigator, was an imposing presence. “Eric positioned himself in a very tactical way in the room, in the jury box, basically right on the witness's shoulder,” said a former associate of Harold's who testified in the case. “When the judge looks at the witness, he's also looking at Eric. It just seems intimidating.” Reuters interviewed more than a dozen legal experts including family law attorneys, law professors, retired judges and marital dissolution consultants. All said that Eissenstat's level of involvement in his boss' divorce trial seemed uncommonly deep. Some said that the role Eissenstat – and by extension, Continental – played at the trial raises questions about whether the company supported the personal agenda of Harold Hamm, the company's top shareholder, to the detriment of other shareholders.  On Thursday, the day after Continental releases its quarterly earnings, analysts will have a chance to ask about the divorce case during a conference call the company is hosting. “It sounds like the corporation is part of the divorce case,” said Arnold Rutkin, a lawyer at Rutkin Oldham in Connecticut. Rutkin represented the wife of Gary Wendt, a former chief executive at the General Electric Capital unit of GE, in one of the biggest U.S. divorces of the 1990s. “There are only two parties in a divorce: husband and wife.” In that case, Rutkin said he did not recall GE Capital's attorneys playing anything close to the role that Eissenstat is playing in the Hamm divorce. A key difference in the cases is that although Wendt was a top executive, he wasn't a major owner of GE. Hamm owns about two-thirds of Continental. Haralson did not respond to questions from Reuters. His bailiff said the judge would not speak publicly about the case before ruling. Continental, in its statement, said it "did not seek to participate in the divorce case." It was compelled to by Sue Ann, it said. In a court filing last month, Continental said the extent of its involvement in the case may be unprecedented. It contends it has been required to turn over more documents and data than any company “has ever been forced to produce in divorce proceedings in Oklahoma and possibly the nation.” Hamm started Continental in 1967, and about 68 percent of the firm's shares are in his name. His stake was worth more than $18 billion when the trial started in August. It's worth around $14 billion today. Since the couple wed in 1988, Continental has grown from a smalltime driller worth less than $50 million into a $20 billion behemoth and one of Oklahoma's largest companies. Because Harold owned his shares before he and Sue Ann were married, they belong to him. But under Oklahoma law, their “active” appreciation since 1988 is subject to “equitable distribution” with Sue Ann, a former executive at Continental who filed for divorce from Harold in 2012. Her legal team contends that the amount of marital wealth the court should divide is more than $17 billion, a sum that included most of Harold's stake in Continental a few months before the trial began. Court filings show that his attorneys argued that the couple's shared wealth is a tiny fraction of that amount. The couple never signed a prenuptial agreement. Harold Hamm's leadership at Continental is central to the case. In court, his lawyers attributed most of Continental's success not to Hamm's business savvy but to factors beyond his control. If Haralson accepts the argument – that market factors such as rising oil prices, or decisions made prior to marriage caused Continental's growth – the award to Sue Ann could be much smaller. The trial ended on Oct. 9, and Haralson is poring over thousands of pages of evidence before he issues a judgment in the coming weeks, or the two sides settle. Last week, Haralson denied a motion by Reuters to intervene in the case to have trial transcripts and other records unsealed. The Oklahoma Supreme Court, which heard the Reuters request to unseal the records this week, has not yet ruled. In a filing before those hearings, Continental said it opposed opening court records because the documents contain confidential business information, including strategic plans, board minutes, and highly sensitive information on its oil reserves, among other things. “A corporate counsel would have a legitimate role in trying to keep confidential information about the company from being disseminated,” said Ilan Hirschfeld, head of the marital dissolution practice at the consultancy firm Marcum LLP in New Jersey. Continental may also have a significant interest in the outcome of the trial. If Sue Ann, 58, wins a multi-billion dollar award, a judgment that size could prompt Harold to sell Continental shares, a move that could lead to a change in control of the company. In one court filing, Continental dismissed that possibility as "unfounded speculation." Eissenstat, appointed as Continental's general counsel in 2010, previously had represented Continental and Harold Hamm personally during 27 years in private practice. As recently as 2010, he served as Harold's personal lawyer in a case involving Oklahoma oil and gas wells. Continental was not a party in that case. As of Feb. 22, Eissenstat also owned shares in Continental valued at more than $7 million, SEC filings show. Months before the Hamm divorce trial, Continental expanded Eissenstat's role at the firm, naming him its chief risk officer. The new responsibilities put Eissenstat in charge of keeping Continental out of corporate governance trouble and guarding against conflicts of interest and reputational damage – duties that would give Eissenstat reason to be concerned about the divorce trial. In court filings, Continental said it was brought into the case by Sue Ann Hamm's broad and “abusive” demands for evidence from the company, and because dozens of its current or former employees were subpoenaed. “Continental doesn't like being here,” Eissenstat said at a pre-trial hearing, according to a transcript. Eissenstat told the judge he was only present in court to protect the firm's interests, not Harold's. Allegations by Sue Ann's team that Continental meddled in the case to help Harold have been a sore point between the spouses. In one court filing, his divorce attorneys wrote that the divorce is a matter of “common interest for Mr. Eissenstat,” citing his duty to “all shareholders to oversee any litigation impacting the company.” They added: “Harold Hamm and his counsel are frankly insulted by Petitioner's veiled suggestion of some collusion between them and (Continental) against her interests.” Although Continental says it hasn't taken sides in the divorce, the company has taken unusual steps that could help Harold's case. In September, Reuters reported that the company revised its corporate history in ways that diminish the part Hamm played in its success. In downplaying the CEO's role, the firm recently deleted, added or revised at least 18 items on its website or in corporate filings, Reuters found. (http://reut.rs/1uYWqpH)  In addition, Continental has weighed in against Sue Ann. In one of the company's many filings in the case, a “friend-of-the-court” brief in February, Continental urged the judge to deny Sue Ann additional time to prepare for the trial. “To say the least, it's highly unusual for a company to file a friend-of-the court brief in its CEO's closed-door divorce proceeding to oppose his wife's request for more trial preparation time,” said appellate attorney Lawrence Ebner, a Washington-based partner at law firm McKenna Long &amp; Aldridge. Court records show that Haralson denied Sue Ann Hamm's request for another five months of trial preparation. Being hurried to trial could hurt her case, her lawyers contended in court filings, because they were racing to examine about 700,000 pages of uncategorized Continental documents that Eissenstat had delivered to them in response to evidence requests. A spokeswoman for Continental, Kristin Miskovsky, has repeatedly said the divorce has had no effect on the company. “Mr. Hamm's divorce proceeding is a private matter and has not and is not anticipated to impact Continental Resources' business or operations,” the company said. In one court filing, however, the company says its role in the case has come at “enormous expense.” Eissenstat and his in-house team handled discovery requests in the case. They have filed more than 40 briefs, objections or motions in the divorce case. “Mr. Hamm has an interest in winning, and Continental should not have an interest in Hamm winning per se,” said Paula Dalley, a professor of corporate law at Oklahoma City University Law School. “That's where a conflict of interest could arise. The outcome for Hamm personally shouldn't matter to the corporation.” Former Continental employees who were deposed or called as witnesses told Reuters that the oil company paid for lawyers to represent them. The employees requested anonymity after signing agreements not to discuss their depositions or testimony. It is not unusual for company lawyers to represent employees who will testify in legal cases about their work. But Judith Maute, a law professor at the University of Oklahoma, said that if Eissenstat and Continental used company resources to help Harold, it could draw the ire of other shareholders.  A general counsel's duty is to his corporation, not to the CEO's personal interests, she said. “If the general counsel is spending lots of time or company money to save the assets of the person, then he may be in breach of fiduciary duties to shareholders.” Eissenstat's role and Continental's costly involvement in the marital dispute have not been disclosed in detail to the firm's shareholders. How much the company's board knows about Continental's participation in the Hamms' divorce isn't clear. Continental declined to address the question of whether it plans to bill Harold Hamm for the costs it's incurring related to the divorce case. What is apparent is the trust the company has put in its top lawyer. Asked about Continental's involvement in the case, David Boren, the powerful Oklahoma politician who sits on Continental's board and testified in the divorce trial, had little to say. “I have a policy not to make separate statements as a board member,” Boren said. “If you have any questions, please contact Eric Eissenstat.”  (Reporting By Joshua Schneyer in Oklahoma City and Brian Grow in Atlanta.

TruliaElon Musk, billionaire founder of SpaceX, Tesla, and PayPal, leads a pretty amazing life.  In January 2013, he spent $17 million on a 20,248-square-foot mansion in Los Angeles' Bel Air neighborhood. He and his five sons had lived in the house for three years, which Musk rented before he felt financially secure enough to buy.  The home, which has seven bedrooms, a giant screening room, a pool, and a tennis court, is what you would expect from a man worth $8.6 billion. In November of 2013, Musk paid $6.75 million for a ranch home located across the street from the mansion.

REUTERS/Reuters TVHong Kong police charged Rurik Jutting, 29, with two counts of murderFour days after two Indonesian sex workers are found dead at the home of University of Cambridge graduate Rurik Jutting, police crack down on Hong Kong’s red light district Dozens of police raided neon-lit prostitution joints and bars in Hong Kong on Wednesday night following the vicious murders of two women at the nearby home of British banker Rurik Jutting. At around midnight, plainclothes and uniformed agents swept into the Neptune III Disco, a basement dance club in the Wan Chai red light district, past a sign, in English and Chinese, that read: “No immoral activities, No soliciting”. Inside the smoky nightclub dozens of scantily clad women, the majority Filipinas, crowded around the bar and mingled with western men in suits. Police officers demanded to see work and immigration documents from the women and left around 10 minutes later without making any arrests. Officers and police vans were also positioned on street corners around the red light district – an unusual sight, according to locals. The sale of drugs and sex went on unabated. Asked if the police operation was connected to the murders of two Indonesian women at Mr Jutting’s nearby flat, one officer told The Telegraph: “There is a little bit of a relationship.” The raids came nearly four days after the bodies of two Indonesian women were found at Mr Jutting’s nearby home, which is just two blocks from Hong Kong’s gritty entertainment district. Sumarti Ningshi, a 25-year-old mother-of-one, was killed at Mr Jutting's flat on October 27 and subsequently stuffed into a suitcase, police believe. Her friend Seneng Mujiasih – a 32-year-old better known as Jesse Lorena – is thought to have been stabbed to death in the early hours of Saturday morning. Just hours earlier she stopped outside her local Wan Chai pub and told friends: “I’m going to have fun”. The TelegraphThe Telegraph reports that these women were Jutting's victims.Mr Jutting, who until recently worked for Bank of America Merrill Lynch, appeared in court on Monday morning to be charged with the crimes. A reconstruction is expected to take place on Friday. Wan Chai’s sex workers – impoverished young women who in many cases work to support young children back home - say they have been left shaken by the killings. Their reluctance to speak openly about the crime is compounded by the fact that many are working illegally in the former British colony. “I’ve seen him in here a few times,” one Filipina sex worker, who was at the Neptune III Disco, said of Mr Jutting. Another woman, who is from the island of Mindanao in the southern Philippines, ran her finger across her throat. “It could have been one of us,” she said. Police say they found a small quantity of cocaine at Mr Jutting’s flat and the second sex worker said it was common to see well-off expats using drugs, particularly cocaine, in Wan Chai. A gram of the drug costs around HK$1,000 (£80.50). “It’s so normal here,” said the woman. Mr Jutting, a 29-year-old University of Cambridge graduate, is believed to have met both of the murdered women in bars near his 31st floor flat at the upmarket “J Residence”. He met Ms Lorena late last Friday night at the New Makati Pub &amp; Disco, a first floor nightclub which the Lonely Planet guide describes as “sleazy pick up joint” frequented by “white male booze-hounds". On Wednesday night a man who identified himself as the club’s manager refused to allow journalists into the club or to answer questions. Local sex workers said Mr Jutting had been a regular patron of the New Makati. The British banker is believed to have met Sumarti Ningshi at another nearby club called the Hong Kong Café. However, Anthony Chan, its manager, denied ever having seen Mr Jutting. “I would remember it,” he said. “He was a big guy. He looked like an American.” FREE AppDownload
In his first press conference as Senate majority-leader-in-waiting, Mitch McConnell proclaimed an end to governing by crisis and was optimistic the new Republican-controlled Senate could find areas of common ground with President Barack Obama. "There will be no government shutdowns, and no defaults on the national debt," McConnell said during a press conference in Louisville, the day after he romped to a 16-point victory over Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes.  After Tuesday night's results, Republicans hold a 52-45 advantage in the Senate. When all is said and done, it's likely they will control at least two more. McConnell expects to be elected the next majority leader upon the start of the next Congress. McConnell cited trade and tax reform as two potential issues of cooperation between Republicans in Congress and the White House. He said he spoke with Obama on Wednesday, and trade was an issue that came up. "I think he's interested in moving forward. I said send us trade agreements. We're anxious to take a look at them," McConnell said.  But he said the Senate will be "voting on things the administration is not fond of," like the Keystone XL Pipeline, which the Obama administration has delayed multiple times over the past few years. McConnell said starting the final phase of the pipeline is only part of the GOP's energy agenda.  McConnell outlined a Republican goal of forcing Obama to make a choice on bills that will make it to his desk, since he still wields a powerful pen with which he can veto legislation.   "The veto pen is a pretty powerful tool," McConnell said. A big part of McConnell's early plan as majority leader involves, as he put it, "getting the Senate back to normal." McConnell has openly clashed with current Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid about his management of the Senate. A return to normalcy, for McConnell, means "working more" and possibly reverting some rules changes brought on by Reid. McConnell said he had gotten calls from "three prominent Democrats" in the past 18 hours who are "anxious to be relevant again" and get things accomplished in the Senate. "We're going to function," he said. FREE AppDownload
A private Princeton University eating club is being investigated by the university and local police after reports that a photo of two students performing a sex act — one that may be classified as sexual assault — was distributed through email among members, The Times of Trenton reports. According to The Times, local police began an investigation on Tuesday into Princeton's Tiger Inn eating club after details of the alleged photo appeared on a local blog, Planet Princeton. The university was already looking into the claims, Planet Princeton reported. "The Princeton University daily crime log on Tuesday listed a 'sexual assault' allegation reported on Monday evening having occurred on Oct. 10 at 48 Prospect Ave., which is the address of the Tiger Inn," The Times reports. However, the local Princeton police chief told The Times that "no victim has been identified and no witnesses have come forward in the alleged Oct. 10 incident." Without any confirmation of the photo or the alleged assault, it will be unlikely that the police can complete a full investigation. Planet Princeton has anonymous details about the alleged photo: An intoxicated first-year female student at Princeton University allegedly began performing oral sex on a senior on the dance floor at the private eating club, and someone allegedly snapped a photo of the act. An officer of the private eating club later allegedly distributed the photo to Tiger Inn members via email, some students claim. Tiger Inn was in the news earlier this year after their house was reportedly trashed by a secret society of Princeton students that gathers together the heaviest drinkers on campus for an annual drinking contest — 21 beers in 42 minutes.

October's Macau revenue numbers are in, and what's clear is that the retail gambler is not going to save Macau. For months the narrative about Macau's sliding casino revenues has gone like this: Yes, the VIP high-rollers are staying away from the tables because of China's nation-wide corruption crack down, but mass market numbers — families, middle class people etc. — will  steadily increase as more Chinese enter that middle class. This will not only save Macau over time, but also change it forever. Instead of a gangster's paradise in the South China Sea, it will become the kind of place where Cher and Celine Dion want to do month-long residencies. That's the dream. Now Wall Street is starting to see the reality. In October Macau's mass market revenue declined 8%, while VIP revenue fell a whopping 30.8%. A lot of analysts thought that mass market revenue would be up in the single digits. In a recent research note, Sterne Agee says that the mass decline was probably due to new smoking regulations in casinos. "We believe operators have worked to re-designate certain premium mass stables to VIP in order to comply with recently implemented smoking restrictions to the mass floor. Smoking is still allowed in VIP rooms, while the mass floor has gone smoke free," said the note. Okay, so mass market players are getting kicked off their tables. That could be something. But is it enough for an 8% decline? For months Wall Street has cited a myriad of reasons why Macau's numbers are falling — smoking bans, a casino heist scaring off VIP customers... These are issues that will (hopefully) normalize sooner rather than later.  But there's reason to believe Macau's problems are more longterm. At least Sterne Agee admits the corruption campaign is impacting mass market individuals too, not just the high-powered VIP customers China's government has been trying to crack down on. That's more of an admission than Macau's issues are longer term than analysts initially thought. Here's what really needs to be added to the equation, though. China's economy is slowing down fast. This month all of the most closely watched Chinese business surveys were dismal. The HSBC services PMI fell to 52.9 in October from 53.5 in September. The HSBC manufacturing PMI rose to 50.4 from 50.2. The CFLP manufacturing PMI retreated in October to 50.8 from 51.1. The CFLP non-manufacturing PMI also moved lower to 53.8, the lowest since January. The government is committed to letting this happen, only intervening enough to prop up major banks so that they can continue lending to cash strapped, highly indebted Chinese corporates. In other words, this isn't over yet. In the meantime, China's casino-goers may want to save their yuan for something else. FREE AppDownload
Eccentric billionaire Peter Thiel's book "Zero To One" should be required reading for Farnam Street readers. Like "The Hard Thing About Hard Things," it's nice to see another business leader come out and write about life in the trenches in their own voice. I pointed out eight lessons that I took away, although there are many more hidden in the book. In 2012 the Wall Street Journal asked him which books he enjoyed most in 2012, he responded with the following three suggestions: "100 Plus," by Sonia Arrison… was first published in 2011, but its message is evergreen: how scientists are directly attacking the problem of aging and death and why we should fight for life instead of accepting decay as inevitable. The goal of longer life doesn't just mean more years at the margin; it means a healthier old age. There is nothing to fear but our own complacency. "Bloodlands," by Timothy Snyder … He tells how the Nazis and the Soviets drove each other to ever more murderous atrocities as they fought to dominate Eastern Europe in the 1930s and '40s. Even as he calculates the death toll painstakingly, Mr. Snyder reminds us that the most important number is one: Each victim was an individual whose life cannot be reduced to the violence that cut it short. "Resurrection From the Underground," by René Girard … the great French thinker René Girard's classic study of Fyodor Dostoevsky …. There is no better way to think about human irrationality than to read Dostoevsky, and there is no better reader of Dostoevsky than Mr. Girard. For a fresh application of Mr. Girard's insights into power politics, that great international theater of irrationality, try Jean-Michel Oughourlian's "Psychopolitics," a brief, freewheeling 2012 work by one of Mr. Girard's closest collaborators. Of course those were only his favorite books that year. So what then influenced his thinking overall? Luckily he answered this question in a reddit AMA. Prefacing his response with "I like the genre of past books written about the future," he went on to list four books: Amazon"New Atlantis," by Francis BaconBacon writes of a Utopian land called Bensalem where people live better lives because of science. Bacon "focuses on the duty of the state toward science, and his projections for state-sponsored research anticipate many advances in medicine and surgery, meteorology, and machinery." Keep in mind this was written in 1627. "The American Challenge," by Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber A book that foresaw the information age. Here is a powerful quote from the book: "The signs and instruments of power are no longer armed legions or raw materials or capital… The wealth we seek does not lie in the earth or in numbers of men or in machines, but in the human spirit. And particularly in the ability of men to think and to create." "The Great Illusion A Study of the Relation of Military Power to National Advantage"I'd never heard of this book before now, but as one Amazon reviewer summed it up: "(this is) a tightly reasoned and broadly historical perspective challenging the reigning view that man's nature is inherently evil and that evil nature must dictate human relations." "The Diamond Age: Or, a Young Lady's Illustrated Primer"I started reading this once and was mesmerized by Stephenson's imaginative future world.

Reuters/Lucy NicholsonTesla is set to release Q3 earnings todayTesla is set to report third quarter earnings after the market closes on Wednesday, November 5. Elon Musk’s electric car company is getting closer to the release of its Model X crossover, and investors will been keen for an update the timing of the Model X launch. Thus far the Model X is slated for an ambiguous Spring 2015 release. The Model X crossover vehicle hasn’t been officially priced yet, but it will play a crucial intermediary role in Elon Musk’s plan to bring the electric car to the masses.  Tesla’s strategy can be thought of as an upside down pyramid. When the company began producing its Model S luxury sedan in 2012, production was quite limited and the cars were unobtainable for most with the price point starting around $70,000. The broad plan is to introduce new vehicles that target wider audiences over time as the company scales up its production capabilities. Tesla’s longer term goal is to scale up its manufacturing potential to the point where it can make affordable electric cars for the middle class, breaking the average American’s dependence on gasoline powered transportation. Lithium ion batteries have been one chief constraint, but Tesla’s under-construction Gigafactory in Nevada should help to alleviate that bottleneck.  An important part of the process for Tesla is to generate some profits now to help fund its necessary expansion to reach its goal. Like last quarter, today investors and contributing analysts on Estimize are forecasting much better earnings than Wall Street is calling for. The Estimize community consensus is that Tesla will report earnings of 8 cents per share topping the Street’s view for a break even quarter. Furthermore, on average, contributors on Estimize are expecting Elon Musk and Co. to top Wall Street’s revenue projection by a whopping $29 million (3.4%).  If we compare to last quarter, the 8 cent differential between earnings estimates from Wall Street and the Estimize community is exactly in-line with the 12c vs 4c discrepancy going into the 2nd quarter of 2014. Tesla ended up missing the Estimize consensus by a penny, reporting earnings of 11 cents. Although Tesla missed the Estimize consensus by 1 cent in July, it surprised to the upside on sales. After the close the consensus is for Tesla to continue piling up the revenue while maintaining its 3 quarter streak of beating Wall Street’s earnings expectations by a hefty margin. The key change here is on sales expectations. 3 months ago there was only a $3 million (&lt;1%) difference in revenue expectations. Today analysts on Estimize are expecting Tesla to ship more units of the Model S and generate way more cash than the Street is forecasting. FREE AppDownload
Clinton Hill is on the rise. An influx of residential buildings are flooding into the small neighborhood that borders Fort Greene, replacing a local funeral parlor, gas stations, the post office and even a White Castle. Two new developments were recently completed and 11 more are underway in Clinton Hill, adding more than 1,000 apartment in the neighborhood, according to developers. Some sites, such as 93 Waverly Ave. and 96 Steuben St., which were completed earlier this year, offer luxury amenities such as a doorman, individual rooftop vegetable and herb gardens, courtyards and views of the Manhattan skyline. Other developments, like the 240-unit development in the former Pratt Post Office location, promise to bring affordable housing and new ground-floor businesses to the neighborhood. "There is a definite uptick in new developments in Clinton Hill," said David Maundrell, founder and president of aptsandlofts.com, who said the area's rising popularity is boosted by its proximity to Barclays Center, the Brooklyn Navy Yard, Fort Greene and Downtown Brooklyn."It's a great area — It is more 'neighborhood-y' that Downtown Brooklyn and more affordable than Fort Greene. And Myrtle Avenue has come a long way in the last decade," he added. In the last quarter, more than a third of all condo sales in new developments in Brooklyn took place in Clinton Hill, according to a MNS Real Estate report.Wikimedia Commons This development was completed early this year and contains 17 units throughout the buildings. The loft-like residences feature double height ceilings and many have private outdoor space in addition to a communal roof with individual vegetable and herb gardens for each resident, according to aptsandlofts.com. All units are currently leased. This seven-story, 35-unit building was completed earlier this year and features a common courtyard, doorman and roof deck with views of Manhattan. Unit prices range from $2,500 for a one-bedroom to $3,800 for a two-bedroom. Some units are still available to rent. The Daten Group purchased the Coastal Gas station lot for $7.4 million and plans to demolish the structure to build a 40,000-square-foot building with 38 apartments.  The new building will also have 5,000 square feet of retail space on the first floor. The former post office, located at 524 Myrtle Ave., will soon be home to an eight-story, 240-unit residential building with 20 percent of units under market rate. Another building at 492 Myrtle Ave. will also be eight stories and contain 240 units. Construction is underway, but it is unclear when the buildings will be complete. Leasing started earlier this year for the seven-story, 32-unit building, which leases the ground floor retail space to “A Kid’s Dream” hair salon. The building at 266 Greene Ave. will have four stories with three rental units, according to permits filed with the Department of Buildings. It is unclear when construction will be complete. Construction is underway on a five-story building that will have 38 apartments and 19 parking spaces. The building will be “finished with a dark grey facade and sleek modern windows by the end of next summer,” according to Fort Greene Focus. The property is being developed by Queens-based Kahen Properties, according to DOB records. A seven-story, 23-unit building with commercial space on the ground floor was recently approved by the Department of Buildings. It is unclear when the building will be complete. Construction on a seven-story apartment building with 18 apartments is underway on Classon Avenue near Fulton Street, according to DOB records. It is unclear when the project will be complete. This property, once the site of a funeral parlor, will be a six-story residential building with 28 units plus laundry, bike parking, balconies and shared outdoor space, according to Massey Knakal Realty. This seven-story, 35-unit building, designed by Isaac and Stern Architects, may also contain commercial space on the ground floor. It will be complete in the fall of 2015, according to Fort Greene Focus. Architect Karl Fischer is planning to replace the former White Castle on Myrtle Avenue with a five-story, 27-unit residential building with 5,900-square-feet of commercial space.

 Wall Street's equity analysts provide investors with research notes that typically include profit forecasts for companies. They also include recommendations on whether to buy or sell a company's stock. However, the nature of these analysts' work often exposes them to all sort of conflicts of interest. A lot of the reason people listen to Wall Street analysts is that they get more access to company management than almost anybody else. Analysts who have negative ratings on companies, however, risk not either getting this access, or getting the cold shoulder from management. This conflict tends to encourage analysts to assign favorable ratings to companies. But conflicts can get much deeper, and even disturbing. A new paper from Ben Lourie of UCLA (via Matt Levine) explores an what's called the "revolving-door" phenomenon.  The revolving-door phenomenon is a concept that explores the idea that sell-side analysts who are more bullish on a company they cover are more likely to be hired by that company.  And Lourie's analysis finds that, essentially, this is the case. Lourie finds that analysts who went to work for a company they covered as an analyst had higher price targets on the company's stock, more optimistic recommendations about the company, a more pessimistic view about their competitors' prospects, and issued more reports than other analysts in the year before joining the firm.  As Lourie writes, "The findings raise concerns about their independence and indicate a potential benefit to tightening employment regulations in this industry."  You don't say.  And another potential conflict Lourie addresses is that, despite rules outlined in Reg FD and myriad other financial regulations, there is no law requiring that analysts have any "cooling off" period between covering a company and joining that company as an employee. Lourie finds that the only FINRA regulation specifically addressing this problem states that when "a research analyst is pursuing employment or has accepted a job with a covered company, NASD rules require that information concerning such a clear conflict of interest must be disclosed in research reports." So basically, were I an equity analyst covering Company X, I could publish lots of insanely bullish forecasts and, unless I knew I was going to work there, and not just not-so-subtlely making clear to the company that I wanted to work there, I wouldn't have to add additional disclosures to my research. And only once has an analyst been charged with violating this regulation. (That analyst was fined $12,500, which as Lourie writes, is a "small deterrent to future analysts who might be tempted to make themselves more attractive" as potential employees.) In his paper, Lourie explore three possible explanations for why an analyst could be attractive to a company as an employee, aside from just like, you know, sucking up to them. The first possibility is that companies identify analysts who provide more accurate earnings per share forecasts and hire those analysts; "revolving-door" analysts are, in fact, on average, less accurate than other analysts. The second possible explanation is that there is some inherent quality in certain analysts that companies look for in future employees. Lourie finds, however, that analysts who spend at least one year in another job before going to work for a firm they previously covered as an analyst display no change in their behavior during the final year as an analyst.  Finally, Lourie looks to see if hired analysts are, in general, more optimistic about the company than other analysts. "While the true opinion of the analyst is non-observable," Lourie writes, "the fact that the change in the analyst behavior occurs in the year just prior to their move to the covered firms makes this explanation less likely." So the answers are basically no, no, and no. We are slowly coming out of the heart of earnings season. This is the period when thousands of companies report earnings within a few weeks of one another and then everybody gets to make big pronouncements about the health of a company, an industry, or the global economy based on a quarter's worth of financial performance.  And as a company, the best thing you can say is that you "beat" expectations. This can mean reporting earnings per share (EPS) of $4 against expectations for $1, or EPS of $1 against expectations for $0.99. Report EPS 300% above expectations? Beat. Reports EPS 1% above expectations? Beat.  Either way, you're a winner! And what Lourie found is that companies that hire former analysts in an investor relations function have a "higher propensity to slightly beat the consensus EPS forecast."  The implication here being that if you, as a company, hire a former analyst to be your liaison with the analyst community, you can "manage" analysts' earnings expectations such that the company is in a better position to offer the market a "beat," however slight.  The problem with all this is that people think lots of bad things about analysts.  Lourie notes that past research has shown the variety of conflicts analysts have when their firm handles investment banking or other functions, like auditing, for a company. But there are no rules that seek to rein in an analysts' coverage of a company they are seeking to work for. The obvious complication here is like, can you reasonably get an analyst to disclose in their research that they've applied for a job with Company X, or that they just had a phone interview, or a breakfast meeting, or something with a representative of Company X? It's not clear what sort of leverage (or impetus) FINRA has with respect to adding these sorts of things.  But what is clear is that Lourie's work shows that there is some tilt toward more favorable coverage from analysts who cover a company in the final year before they begin working for that company. Which is probably something we should at least be talking about.  Start by reading Lourie's full paper here »    FREE AppDownload
Throughout history, humans have been the most intelligent beings on earth. But is this about to change? The advancement of neural networks could be the single most important development in helping machines think more like humans. Investors should take note. The human body is incredibly adept at sensing the world around it—largely thanks to a complex nervous system manned by a massive network of neurons. These neurons “fire” when they’re stimulated by inputs such as images or temperature. They act independently, but the network processes information collectively and efficiently. The human brain is the most complex neural network, with an estimated 80–100 billion neurons, each with 1,000 connections. Building a Brain: Helping Machines Learn It’s not easy to mimic the human brain. Stanford University professor Andrew Ng took an early stab at it in 2011 with Google’s Deep Learning project—later called “Google Brain.” The initial setup had 1,000 computer servers and was roughly equivalent (as measured by the number of connections) to a honeybee’s brain. The cost? A cool $5 million. After Google Brain was fed YouTube images for three straight days, it could identify the faces of a human and a cat. Recently, another tech firm, Nvidia, announced hardware that had similar capabilities but cost only $33,000, bringing brain-like architecture (or thinking) to the masses. Google Brain is an example of machine learning—using hardware and software to solve problems through “learning” instead of through rule-based instructions. Artificial neural networks (ANNs), modeled after the complex neural connections in the human brain, have been one of the most successful of these approaches so far. Early Applications of Neural Networks Neural networks are already at work in more places than you might think. Facebook and Google use them in image searches and to dynamically target advertisements to users. Car manufacturers use them to process images from onboard cameras feeding safety features like lane-drift warnings and pedestrian detection. In fact, any computer application that uses pattern recognition or image analysis is perfect for a neural network framework. And there’s more and more data to work with: the amount of analyzable data in the world is growing exponentially (Display). Alliance BernsteinMost efforts so far to imitate the human brain have centered around software, but in recent years researchers have tried their hands at hardware too. IBM is working on a computer chip that has better sensory capabilities and uses less power than traditional chips. The company’s long-term goal is to create a system of 10 billion neurons that consumes 1 kilowatt of power and has a volume of less than two liters. IBM has committed $3 billion over the next five years to semiconductor research in areas such as new chip architectures. Other companies such as QUALCOMM are making similar investments.  Who’s Capitalizing on Machine-Based Learning? Google and Facebook have been noted for their efforts to recruit thought leaders applying this technology. It’s not surprising that these tech-savvy companies are leading in machine learning. But the applications are likely to span multiple industries. One notable example is the race to design the most effective semi- and fully autonomous driving systems. Given the massive volume of images that must be captured and processed for these systems, the hardware vendors, auto parts suppliers and original equipment manufacturers that can design the most efficient and accurate systems will see quicker times to market and fewer incidents. Neural network frameworks may be a real differentiator. Smaller, entrepreneurial finance companies are also using neural networks to create better lending models by more accurately predicting credit behaviors, such as defaults. Fraud detection—where pattern recognition is particularly useful—is another emerging application. This technological shift is changing how investors gauge a company’s potential in terms of its intellectual property. Traditionally, one measure of this has been a company’s patent portfolio. Today, it may be better to know how many machine-learning experts are on staff. More talent usually leads to better products and smarter capital spending—driven by neural networks’ greater efficiency versus traditional data analysis. This is especially true for companies whose products involve image and pattern recognition. Even today, our understanding of how the human brain works is still limited. The more we understand, the more complex we can make the systems that mimic the brain. True artificial intelligence may still be a few years away, but progress is being made on this incredible journey. Today’s machines are more adaptive than ever—mainly because of neural networks. As company assets, experts in machine learning are quickly becoming as important as patent portfolios.

So you got funded and you're the CEO – oddly terrifying, really, that you should be so unprepared for the biggest job of your life. Here's the crash course you didn't know you needed.  As CEO, the way you interact with your board members informs how they think of you as a leader, manager, and strategist. Yet most first-time CEOs run lousy board meetings, fail to set expectations with the board, and, worse, think of board gatherings as an obligatory penance for having raised money.  You don't want to invite board skepticism because of a sloppy process. Here's how to handle your board and board meetings:  For early-stage companies, schedule board meetings at two- to three-month intervals and for three hours. Get the meetings on your board's calendar one year in advance. Board members are busy, too. Unless you are shuttering or selling the company, last-minute requests for meetings drive them crazy.  Two weeks before a board meeting, send an email to the board with a proposed agenda of no more than five to six topics, and ask for their feedback. You will rarely get any, but you are creating transparency and openness with them, which is critical to a healthy dialogue — and your success.  Board materials — decks, docs, whatever you want them to read — need to be in their inboxes three to five business days before the board meeting. Don't fire decks off last minute with the excuse that you were waiting for final figures, app downloads, or total number of granola bars consumed by employees last quarter.  A board meeting is not final; it is directional. Metrics that are a week or two old are fine, if it serves your ability to get the materials out on time. In your cover email, ask board members to read everything before the meeting. That way, you won't have to run through decks slide by slide.  Near the top of my board agenda, I lead with "What I Worry About," a single slide that summarizes my business anxieties. This does two things. First, it shows that you are focused on what can go wrong, since what goes right tends to take care of itself. Second, it brings the board members in on how you think about, and create context for, your business. (After you go public, this is a slide your lawyers will discourage you from writing, or at least want to rename.)  Often, we spend 20 to 30 minutes on this one slide. And then, of course, the deck materials (financials, product reviews, competitive threats) can be referred to, since everyone is expected to have already read them. You see where this is going? You are beginning to manage your board. During the board meeting, I like to have one to two presentations from senior team members on a critical initiative they've led. They will value the exposure to the board, and it's important for the board to see your team in action. It helps them evaluate the quality of their thinking, as well as the quality of your hiring. As a general rule, however, don't crowd the boardroom for too long.  Only under penalty of death should you have consultants come in to present. The lease on a new building, 409a valuations, the status of your audit — cover that stuff in committees or by email. None of those topics will drive the business, so you are wasting valuable board time.  When things are not going well, don't talk about how hard it has been on you or your team. They pay you a lot of money, or they think they do, and you have a big job. Suck it up. Cry to your barista, not to the board.  GenecastThe first board meeting of Divide, a mobile device management service that was acquired by Google. Schedule 20 minutes for open discussion near the end, and excuse everyone except board members. Ask if the meeting hit the topics they thought were most important. Anything is fair game. Be open. Encourage them to speak their minds. Discourage back-channeling. Boards that require pre- and post-board powwows to discuss issues that they didn't want to bring up in the board meeting are already broken. Take notes on follow-ups, and summarize these briefly out loud.  The final agenda item is always the same – 15 minutes for the board to discuss anything it wants in private. Without you. Leave them on their own. This way, you force them to create feedback. Maybe they all stampede to the elevator. Fine, that means they feel comfortable and have no issues with you or the business. Maybe one of them gets appointed to give you feedback. Great. You have set a tone. You expect them to discuss you and the business in an open and unencumbered way as a part of every board meeting.  Write a short note to the board every few weeks, or upon an important occasion, like a new hire, a key customer defection, or a piece of good or bad financial news. The tone is always of transparency and offering insights. Your VC board members sit on other boards. Small notices of your progress, or decline, are generally welcome.  Many of my past board members, such as Vinod Khosla or Bill Helman, believe that not much of importance gets accomplished in board meetings. You are unlikely to change their minds, so budget time for these discussions.  While some informal time with board members is a good idea, the quality of the board meetings and the dynamic of the discussion is yours to set. Generally I think of managing the board as equal to about one or one and half direct reports. While the above should help guide the tone and architecture of your board relationships, it doesn't address the content of the meetings. What you choose to prioritize and review with your board in many ways reveals how you think about your business. In the end, that is more important than anything.  George Bell is a five-time CEO and an XIR at the Cambridge-based venture capital firm General Catalyst Partners.

Republicans will adopt a combative but strategic approach toward governing now that they have swept to control of both chambers of the US Congress, top GOP lawmakers and aides have told Business Insider over the past month.  With an eye toward the 2016 presidential election, Republican leaders in the House and Senate will look to move forward GOP legislative priorities popular with the American public and could earn an ample number of Democratic votes to send to President Barack Obama's desk. They'll also aim to show they are the party best able to run the country. "We want to demonstrate a kind of competence that Harry Reid has not," a senior Republican Senate aide told Business Insider, referring to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. "They have governed with the sole purpose of casting the Republican Party in a bad light," the aide said of the Democrats. "We want to pass legislation that casts the party in a more favorable light." Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who won his race by a whopping 16 points Tuesday night, is expected to become the next Senate Majority Leader in a Senate that will likely be controlled by a 54-46 GOP majority after a runoff election in Louisiana next month. Republicans also expanded their majority in the House of Representatives, picking up at least 14 seats with 16 races still hanging in the balance. As it stands now, Republicans hold a 243-176 House majority. Reid released a statement congratulating McConnell on his expected promotion Tuesday night. &gt;"I'd like to congratulate Senator McConnell, who will be the new Senate Majority Leader. The message from voters is clear: they want us to work together," Reid said. "I look forward to working with Senator McConnell to get things done for the middle class." But some of the immediate legislative priorities that Republicans will look to act on include items where the parties have been unable to compromise. They include passage of the Keystone XL Pipeline — which the Obama administration has delayed several times over the past three years — chipping away at the Affordable Care Act, and corporate-tax reform. The goal is to force Obama to make decisions on popular bills, putting him in a corner where he will have to either veto legislation or begrudgingly accept it without the "firewall" of a Democratic Senate. Obama has vetoed only two bills during his first six years in office, the fewest since President James Garfield's brief, one-year tenure. "We want to get things in front of the president that define him and his party," the Senate aide said. "Harry Reid has protected him. We want to force him to make a choice." APHarry Reid and Mitch McConnell might be trading places. Analysts consider the finance and energy sectors to potentially see a major boom from a GOP takeover of the Senate. Here's a look at how different areas could be shaped by GOP control of the Senate: The Republican Holy Grail — a bill that repeals the Affordable Care Act — will see its best chance for passage next year. But while there will likely be a full vote in the Senate to repeal the entire healthcare law, aides said, the overall GOP strategy will likely be to chip away at parts of the law in bills that could make it to the president's desk. A full-repeal bill would certainly prompt a presidential veto. One item Republican House and Senate aides think is likely to make it to Obama's desk, and potentially get his signature, is a bill to repeal Obamacare's tax on medical devices. A similar amendment, championed by Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), who is in line to become the next chair of the Senate Finance Committee, passed by a 79-20 vote in 2013. "I think the med-device tax and some other little areas would be the best place to start, because that is the 'possible,'" a senior GOP aide on the Senate Finance Committee told Business Insider of Republicans' pursuit of Obamacare-related legislation in the next session of Congress. Republicans could also take aim at so-called risk corridors in the health law, a potential fight that some Republican senators have already begun discussing as part of a shutdown battle. The "risk corridors" in question aim to make it easier for insurance companies to transition to the new healthcare system, largely by making it less financially risky for them to sell new insurance plans on the government exchanges established by the Affordable Care Act. But Republicans have charged the program amounts to a "bailout" for insurance companies, and a bill targeting the provision is something they think could attract Democratic votes. "Why not just do it separately?" one Republican aide said when asked about the possibility of tying funding for the risk-corridor program to the continuing resolution, which keeps the government funded and needs to be passed by Dec. 11 to prevent a shutdown. If Republicans tackled the issue of risk corridors in a separate bill, it would simplify messaging and make some Democrats more likely to jump on board. In general, Senate Republicans will look to follow the House GOP Obamacare playbook of the past four years. They plan to use their subpoena powers to full effect and hold more oversight hearings on the healthcare law. Some of the issues those potential hearings will focus on include money Republicans claim has been wasted on state insurance exchanges that ended up converting to the federal marketplace, the security of HealthCare.gov and state-exchange websites, and the process for verifying people's incomes to receive subsidies for health insurance. "Being in the minority, we don't have the ability to call a hearing and to get the witnesses that we'd want," the GOP Finance Committee aide said. But should the GOP take the Senate, he added, "I think oversight of Obamacare would be something you'd see a lot more of." AP One of the GOP's first orders of business, should it win the Senate, may well be mounting a united front to oppose any Obama administration-led deal on Iran's nuclear program. Such a move could win the backing of a decent number of Democrats. Such a move could well become the first of many intense fights set for a lame-duck session of Congress. "Where to start?" said Greg Valliere, the chief political strategist at Potomac Research Group. "After the immigration executive order comes a bitter fight on Iranian sanctions, then a battle over whether to pass a continuing spending resolution or an omnibus, then a fight over tax extenders — and that's just in the lame duck." One senior Senate Democratic aide told Business Insider: "GOP will surely be less restrained, to put it mildly!" The Obama administration has signaled it might attempt to maneuver around Congress and avoid allowing a vote on any final agreement with Iran, the deadline of which is set for Nov. 24. But unity among top Republicans and Democrats — including Sens. Mark Kirk (R-Illinois) and Bob Menendez (D-New Jersey) — would make that more difficult. "By threatening to cut out Congress from the Iran nuclear deal, the administration is actually uniting Congress," Kirk said in a recent statement. "We will not support an Obama-Khamenei deal that condemns our children to a future where the Middle East is full of nuclear weapons," he added, referring to Iran's Supreme Leader. Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tennessee) appears next in line to take over from Menendez as chair of the Foreign Relations Committee if Republicans take control of the Senate. Corker has also stressed that any final deal must be approved by Congress. He said on the Senate floor this summer that if Obama did not submit a final approval to Congress by four days after the Nov. 24 deadline, all sanctions relieved under the interim agreement should be restored.APCould Obama find some areas to work with Republicans? But a GOP Senate could also help jump-start a key part of Obama's foreign-policy agenda, where he has run into a roadblock from his own party. The big obstacle to Obama's ambitious trade agenda has so far been Harry Reid. Obama needs Congress to pass a special authority for him to fast-track certain trade deals that Congress can either accept or reject but cannot change. Reid has not allowed a vote on fast-track legislation, and Democrats generally fear expanded trade could cost American jobs and have a negative effect on global wages. But Obama has long advocated a pair of trade agreements with the EU and nations in Asia, saying they will create millions of jobs through a vast expansion of US exports. Republican aides told Business Insider they are open to working with Obama to get fast-track legislation. "Trade is an issue that Democrats see as tough medicine," the GOP Finance Committee aide said. "They know we need it. They know it's good in the long run. It's just hard to swallow. "We feel strongly that if you're another nation who's negotiating with the US, the likelihood of trying to close a deal you can't guarantee is going to get an up-or-down vote in the Senate — there's not a lot of incentive there to close a deal. I think the administration knows they need TPA [Trade Promotion Authority], and it's an issue that splits Democrats much more than it splits Republicans." T.J. Kirkpatrick/Getty ImagesSen. Jeff Sessions. A coming Republican Senate will also make Obama more likely to take executive action quickly on immigration, something he delayed until after the elections. The only question at this point is when, not if. Many analysts expect Obama to announce his executive action before Thanksgiving, and certainly before Congress breaks for Christmas. Either way, Obama's actions will face heavy pushback from Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), the likely next chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Alabama), who will likely take over as chair of the Senate Budget Committee in the GOP Senate. Senate Republicans have stepped up their warnings to the president over the past two weeks, as the electoral map began looking better and better for them. "The President is assuming for himself the sole and absolute power to decide who can enter, work, live, and claim benefits in the United States. He has exempted virtually every group in the world from America immigration laws," Sessions said in a statement last week. Any executive action would effectively poison the well for any legislative fix to the nation's immigration system until after Obama leaves office. The legislation passed by the Senate in 2013 expires with the end of this Congress in early January. Former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney said this weekend that a Republican House and Senate would pass immigration legislation. But Republican strategists speculated that any legislation Republicans would try to pass would be more about messaging on a "secure border" than a comprehensive revamping of the nation's immigration laws. Then there's the ever-ambiguous issue of tax reform, which has been floating around Washington for virtually all of Obama's term. It will figure even more prominently next year as it will be a priority for Republicans who think a revamp of the corporate-tax code is essential to boosting economic growth.  Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wisconsin), considered likely to be the next chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, has put tax reform high on his list of issues to tackle. At a recent campaign stop with Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kansas) in Overland Park, Kansas, Ryan told Business Insider he and Hatch, the likely next chair of the Finance Committee, would work to come up with a proposal by sometime next year. "We have to reform this tax code," Ryan said. "Because we're taxing American businesses at much higher rates than our foreign competitors are taxing theirs." Roberts, who will be a senior member on the Senate Finance Committee, said the House and Senate committees would work as "hard as possible to get it done." "We know it has to be done. It's long overdue," Roberts said. "You elect a Republican majority in the United States Senate, and I can assure you that under Orrin Hatch's leadership, and Paul's leadership, that we will have a proposal for serious tax reform." But privately, both the administration and Republicans are skeptical the other side would work in good faith on tax reform. Republicans felt jilted by the Obama administration's focus on so-called tax inversions this year, which culminated in unilateral action by the Treasury Department to curb the practice earlier this fall.  Republicans agree that the issue of inversions needs to be addressed, but they prefer that it be done as part of broad tax reform. They believe administration focused on the practice for political gain — though it never ended up fully resonating as an issue with the American public. Senior Republicans believe there is a risk the administration would do the same thing with broad tax reform, citing a lack of communication from the White House to top GOP lawmakers on the issue thus far. "There's not a lot of outreach going on about this," one senior Republican Senate aide told Business Insider. "You can already see: They're messaging." AP/J. Scott Applewhite Majority Leader Harry Reid. A significant part of Obama's legacy rests on the judicial nominees he can appoint to courts, which will determine the constitutionality of his administration's policies, regulations, and executive actions long after he leaves office.  With Reid's help, judicial appointments have been one of the few ways Obama has been able to work around Congress. Last year as majority leader, Reid changed Senate rules so that executive and judicial appointees could pass the Senate by a majority vote, taking away most of Republicans' power to filibuster these nominees.  If they control the Senate, that advantage will disappear. Grassley, the likely next chair of the Judiciary Committee, could block any nominees from even receiving a hearing. And McConnell could prevent them from getting a full vote on the Senate floor. Three of Obama's nominees to the powerful US Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit were confirmed last year after Reid changed the Senate's rules. Thanks in large part to Obama's appointments, Democratic-appointed judges now hold a majority on nine of the country's 13 appeals courts. When he started his term, Democrats had a majority on only one of the courts. Many of Obama's appointees are controlling his agenda, writing new rules for financial reform, climate change, and even gun control and immigration. The rules change has the potential to end up being the most important part of Obama's legacy outside of Obamacare. The D.C. Circuit Court, outside of the Supreme Court, is generally considered the second most powerful court in the nation, with its vast jurisdiction over the federal government and thousands of regulations, rules, and executive actions from more than 400 administrative agencies. It's the court, for example, that in January ruled Obama's 2011 recess appointments unconstitutional.   "The issues before this court are some of the most important with respect to administrative law, which is where so much law gets made today," Roger Pilon, the chair of the Cato Institute's Center for Constitutional Studies, told Business Insider. Pilon added: "Sounds like Harry Reid might be getting his comeuppance." One of the key tenets of Obama's second-term agenda, for example, is climate change, on which he has no chance of working with Congress. He has admitted this, and so the Environmental Protection Agency has been writing new rules on climate policy, including new carbon-emissions standards for power plants. Any challenges to Obama's new policies could end up in the D.C. Circuit Court. With a Democratic majority now sitting on the court, those challenges are more likely to be dismissed. A full D.C. Circuit Court panel also agreed to rehear a significant case related to Obamacare after a setback to the law by a smaller, Republican-skewed panel on the court. But a Republican majority will put a significant dent in Obama's ability to reshape the federal judiciary. According to data from the group Alliance for Justice, there are 56 total district and circuit-court vacancies without nominees. Congressional scholar Norm Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute wrote this March that he expects Republicans to confirm virtually none of the possible nominees if they take control.

Bloomberg TVHedge fund manager David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital added Amazon to his "bubble basket" of short positions, according to his fund's Q3 investor letter.  The "Bubble Basket" is a collection of tech stocks that Einhorn believes are overvalued. He announced that Greenlight had created the basket at a conference in May. "We added to our exposure of "Bubble Basket" shorts, AMZN's recent disappointment is notable in that for years, the story has been that AMZN isn't profitable because it is growing so fast. Now growth is slowing, but rather than unleashing higher profits, the slower growth is leading to even greater losses. One of the principal bullish assumptions supporting many bubble stocks is, "the company is growing too fast to be very profitable." We think AMZN is just one of many stocks for which this narrative will ultimately prove false," Einhorn wrote in the letter. Amazon was last trading around $301.51, or down -$1.30, or -0.43%.  Disclosure: Jeff Bezos is an investor in Business Insider through his personal investment company Bezos Expeditions.

According to new purchasing manager surveys from the ISM and Markit, the US services sector is in great shape. Economists noted the unusually strong ISM employment sub-index which jumped to 59.6, the highest level since August 2005. Combined with today's better-than-expected ADP private payrolls report, it's starting to seem more likely that this coming Friday's official payrolls report could beat expectations. Currently, economists forecast nonfarm payrolls climbed by 235,000 in October, driven by a 224,000 gain in private payrolls. Pantheon Macroeconomics' Ian Shepherdson cautions against getting too excited. From his note to clients: "The employment index, however, is still enjoying a hefty seasonal boost, which helps explain why the Oct reading rose to a nine-year high of 59.6. This appears to be consistent with payroll growth of 450,000 per month, which is not going to happen. Had the ISM used the average seasonal factor from 1997 - when the survey started - through 2007, before the financial crisis, the October employment index would have been reported at a much more plausible 57.2, signaling payroll gains at a more plausible - but still very strong - 300,000 or so." 300,000 would be very strong for private payrolls. Of the 44 economists surveyed by Bloomberg, the highest estimate is 265,000. Pantheon Macroeconomics FREE AppDownload
Diane Bondareff/APThe bronze 'Charging Bull' sculpture that symbolizes Wall Street is photographed Tuesday, Feb. 14, 2006, in the financial district of New York. With Republicans taking the majority (but far short of control at 60) in the Senate and increasing their majority in the House, the regulation of our financial markets may see renewed attention, with particular focus on reforming Dodd-Frank. My former employer Senator Richard Shelby takes the Chair on the Senate Banking Committee, while Congressman Jeb Hensarling retains his leadership role on House Financial Services. In my nearly twenty years following financial services, we have not had two chairmen more skeptical of government oversight of our financial markets. While neither could be called “libertarian,” both are suspicious of big government as well as big finance.  Both agree that “Too Big To Fail” is a real issue and one created by the actions of government, not the market. Sen. Shelby, for instance, has repeatedly said “no one is too big to fail” - what he means here is that no company should be getting a bailout.  It was for that reason he led the charge in the Senate against the TARP, and also for that reason he voted against the Chrysler Bailout in 1979.   APShelby also led the efforts to reform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, warning years before their failure of the various flaws inherent in a mortgage model of privatized gains and socialized losses.   Shelby also tried to bring more competition to the credit rating agencies, passing legislation in 2006 to reduce barriers to entry in that market. The above, however, should not be read to overstate the case.  Both Rep. Hensarling (who apparently had a subscription to the Cato Journal in college) and Sen. Shelby would like to see the federal safety net behind our financial markets reduced, allowing a greater role for market discipline.   Perhaps even more rare in D.C., they both believe their chairmanships come not just with privilege but great responsibility.  If it were simply up to these two to agree, I have confidence that our system of financial regulation would be greatly improved, reducing bailouts and increasing stability.   But it isn’t up to these two. There are numerous protectors of the status quo in both major political parties.  Both would also have to reach agreement with the Obama Administration, which seems quite comfortable with bailouts and regulatory discretion.  Ultimately, the many obstacles our Founding Fathers wisely put in place for legislation will prove too high for Shelby and Hensarling to implement all but modest reform.   But at least financial regulation is unlikely to get any worse.

Recently in Paris, Sony strapped its Action Cam Mini on a white-tailed eagle named Victor. It flew from the top of the Eiffel Tower, over the Seine, and down into the Trocadéro Gardens.  The eagle's handler, Jacques Olivier Travers, is the head of the nonprofit organization Freedom, whose objective is to reintroduce the white-tailed eagle into its natural habitat in the French and Swiss Alps. These eagles have been extinct in France for more than 50 years. Check out Sony's Action Cam Mini here &gt;&gt; Follow BI Video: On Facebook
Hedge fund manager David Einhorn, who runs Greenlight Capital, has closed out the rest of his famous Green Mountain Coffee short position, according to an investor letter.  He called it an "ultimately unsuccessful short."  "We closed out a number of positions including the remainder of our short position in Keurig Green Mountain (GMCR). While it should be tempting to write an entire book on our experience with this ultimately unsuccessful short (our average sale was at $47.59 and our average cover was at $67.02; we had many opportunities to trade this position to a successful result, but failed to do so)..." Einhorn wrote in a third-quarter letter to Greenlight investors. Einhorn first disclosed his famous Green Mountain short position in October 2011 at the Value Investing Congress. His 100-plus slide-deck pointed out questionable accounting methods and possible limited demand for its K-cup products.  He still stands by his thesis about the company's accounting.  "As far as we can tell, everything we said about the shenanigans is unrefuted and accurate. In any case, time ahs passed and these misdeeds are now dated. The SEC spent four years looking into the allegations — or, rather, four years passed between when it opened an investigation and closed it.  Shares of GMCR were last trading down about 0.28% at around $151.68 per share.

Ray Dalio has grown his investment firm Bridgewater Associates into the largest hedge fund in the world, with $160 billion in assets. He's worth an estimated $15.2 billion himself. He's a genius, and an eccentric one at that. Dalio believes in "radical transparency," which means that everything at Bridgewater is under constant surveillance — all meetings, all interviews, and all interactions are taped. He runs Bridgewater according to 210 principles that he's collected in a manual for his employees. The Wall Street tabloid blog Dealbreaker leaked this book a few years ago, and the site enjoys poking fun of Dalio's obsessive nature and sometimes flowery philosophizing. The Wall Street Journal's Deal Journal blog dubbed him "Wall Street's Oddest Duck." But Dalio has responded to critics by saying that Bridgewater's unique approach isn't manipulative or cultish, but based on a powerful unifying culture. And clearly whatever they're doing over there is working. Today the 2011 edition of the exhaustive manual he gives to employees is available on Bridgewater's website for anyone to read. We've summarized Dalio's 20 core management principles below. "Create an environment in which everyone has the right to understand what makes sense and no one has the right to hold a critical opinion without speaking up about it," Dalio writes. He believes that even though the truth can be scary (like when your boss points out one of your flaws), it's necessary for optimum performance. Dalio has actually fired employees for talking behind a coworker's back. "If you talk behind people's backs at Bridgewater you are called a slimy weasel," Dalio says. Dalio believes that managers need to expect mistakes from both their employees and themselves. And analysis of mistakes should be quick and as painless as possible. "Create an environment in which people understand that remarks such as 'You handled that badly' are meant to be helpful (for the future) rather than punitive (for the past). While people typically feel unhappy about blame and good about credit, that attitude gets everything backwards and can cause major problems. Worrying about 'blame' and 'credit' or 'positive' and 'negative' feedback impedes the iterative process essential to learning," Dalio writes. Dalio teaches his employees to work at a level where there is a mutual understanding of what needs to be accomplished. One way to achieve this is by using conversations about a certain project as a means of reaching conclusions rather than just brainstorming. He also believes that it is a manager's responsibility to weigh the value of coworkers' opinions. In the same way that you'd value golf advice from Tiger Woods over advice from a friend, Dalio writes, you should value the opinion of a worker with a proven track record over someone without one. Ray Dalio/Bridgewater AssociatesYour team should work as a machine designed to achieve your goals. Before you begin a search for an employee, determine not just the job's qualifications, but which specific qualities you want in that hire. And make sure that the person you are hiring naturally shares your values. Bridgewater employees are given personality tests so that managers can determine how they can best be managed. Dalio's test is essentially his version of the Myers-Briggs test. When considering a job candidate, Dalio places the most importance on values ("deep-seated beliefs that motivate behaviors"), then abilities ("ways of thinking and behaving"), and then skills ("learned tools"). He suggests finding a candidate who doesn't just want the job but wants to be part of the company. "Don't hire people just to fit the first job they will do at Bridgewater; hire people you want to share your life with," Dalio writes, adding that you should "look for people who sparkle, not just 'another one of those.'" "Micromanaging is telling the people who work for you exactly what tasks to do and/or doing their tasks for them. Not managing is having them do their jobs without your oversight and involvement. Managing means: 1) understanding how well your people and designs are operating to achieve your goals, and 2) constantly improving them. To be successful, you need to manage," Dalio says. And to manage effectively, everyone needs to know what the team's long-term goals are and what individual employee's tasks are. Dalio says it's necessary to avoid the term "we should," since an objective should be concrete and assigned to a specific party. "The main reason Bridgewater has improved at a much faster rate than most other companies over the past 30 years is that we seek out problems and find systematic ways of eliminating them," Dalio writes. He thinks that managers and their employees shouldn't pick their battles but fight them all, in the sense that they should never let even small problems float by without being addressed. Don't assume that criticizing your employees will harm them. Discuss their performance with them objectively, and do so in a way that results in a plan for improvement. And don't wait for periodic evaluations to let them know how they're doing. "Child psychologists, dog trainers, and other behavior modification specialists will tell you that constant, no-exception feedback is fundamental to good training," Dalio writes. If you're telling an employee exactly what they need to do to complete a task, then you're either micromanaging or the employee is inept. "So give people your thoughts on how they might approach their decisions or how and why you would operate in their shoes, but don't dictate to them. Almost all that you will be doing is constantly getting in synch about how they are doing things and exploring why," Dalio says. "People who repeatedly operated in a certain way probably will continue to operate that way because that behavior reflects what they're like," Dalio says. That means that if someone isn't clicking with their role, you're doing neither of you a favor by manipulating the role around their tendencies. Consider whether they'd be a better fit elsewhere in the company, and if not, then it's probably best to fire them. Ray Dalio/Bridgewater AssociatesYour team's improvement should look like the top chart and not the bottom. "To perceive problems, compare how the movie is unfolding relative to your script — i.e., compare the actual operating of the machine and the outcomes it is producing to your visualization of how it should operate and the outcomes you expected. As long as you have the visualization of your expectations in mind to compare with the actual results, you will note the deviations so you can deal with them," Dalio writes. And when you get to the root of a problem, avoid generalizations. Use specific names and the specific ways they deviated from your expectations. Don't treat problems as if they are one-time occurrences, Dalio says, since they're just the manifestation of a certain behavior or bias. Work with your employee to find these roots so that the expectation of the mistake being repeated is then lowered. Managers and their employees need to do a post-mortem on resolved problems and place them in the context of the past and the future. Place everything in the context of how you want your "machine," your team, to operate at its peak. "An organization is the opposite of a building — the foundation is at the top," Dalio says. The head of a company should determine their goals and find managers who can help them achieve them by assigning tasks to their direct reports. These individual managers should also hire employees who share their own goals, which fall in line with the company's vision. "You can make great things happen, but you must MAKE great things happen. Times will come when the choice will be to plod along normally or to push through to achieve the goal. The choice should be obvious," Dalio writes. Ray Dalio/Bridgewater AssociatesIf you're on trajectory B, your machine isn't working. "Successful people are great at asking the important questions and then finding the answers. When faced with a problem, they first ask themselves if they know all the important questions about it; they are objective in assessing the probability that they have the answers; and they are good at open-mindedly seeking believable people to ask," Dalio says. Dalio approaches managing people the same way he manages investments. "Recognize opportunities where there isn't much to lose and a lot to gain, even if the probability of the gain happening is low," he writes. Dalio says that leaders are able to determine the importance of the tasks in front of them and take care of the most important things first. "Be an effective imperfectionist. Solutions that broadly work well (e.g., how people should contact each other in the event of crises) are generally better than highly specialized solutions (e.g., how each person should contact each other in the event of every conceivable crisis), especially in the early stages of a plan. There generally isn't much gained by lots of detail relative to a good broad solution," Dalio writes. Dalio recommends reflecting on the events of a day and then determining whether they exceeded your expectations, met them, or fell below them. Over a month (or any longer period of time) the frequency of met and exceeded expectations should be on an upward trajectory. Dalio says that your decisions should be made with this trajectory in mind. "Avoid the temptation to compromise on that which is uncompromisable," and don't try to please everybody with every choice you make for the team.

The best answer to the question, "Is the UK in a house-price bubble?" emerges when you consider that even when growth in property prices is said to be slowing, new records are still being set. Business Insider asked property tracking website Zoopla to chart the number of "property millionaires"— meaning the number of people whose houses are now worth more than £1 million —  in Britain over time.  Zoopla / Business Insider There has been an increase of 49% over the past 12 months, to 484,081 currently, Zoopla said. The average house price in London is now £499,000 ($809,000). The average salary in the UK is around £27,000, which means London houses are basically out of reach of the majority of people. Prices in the UK generally are now back at their 2007 peak, mostly because London is driving up the average, the Guardian reported. In August, UK house prices rose nearly 20% on average, year on year, according to the Office of National Statistics. Even the evidence for the market "cooling" shows that prices are still actually going up. The Financial Times noted: UK house prices fell 0.2 per cent in September, the first monthly fall since April 2013, with annual growth slowing to 9.4 per cent, according to the Nationwide Building Society’s monthly survey. Translation: even when prices decline sequentially, they're still far above the year-on-year price level. Peter Macdiarmid/Getty ImagesAnd here's how Nationwide defines the "slowing" in London: growth is down to 21%, from 25.8% (i.e. it is still growing) and the average price for a London home is now £401,072 – 31% above the 2007 peak, Nationwide says: In the UK as a whole, prices are about 2 per cent above their pre-crisis peak, with the average property costing £188,000 on a non-seasonally adjusted basis, although if London is excluded they are only 1 per cent higher. So is London in a bubble that will suddenly pop? Or a merely boom that may see a soft landing as the market rationalizes declining demand? The case for the boom suggests that as interest rates in the UK are still near zero percent, and not likely to rise soon, then money is still so cheap that buyers will continue to take advantage. Stagnant incomes will moderate demand, and thus prices. The case for the bubble notes that as soon as the Bank of England raises the rate, demand will dry up, and prices will crash. And then there's the issue of London itself. London isn't a finite resource, like the islands of Hong Kong or Manhattan. Those cities are hemmed in by water. And London has barely begun to explore high-rise living. London can go both up and out in ways that Manhattan and Hong Kong can't. The London area can get plenty taller, plenty more dense, and plenty bigger — so supply isn't as restricted. Put those two factors together (higher interest rates and greater supply) and you have a market that may reverse itself with surprising speed. FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersRichard Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas,speaks during at luncheon in Hong KongWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Dallas Federal Reserve president Richard Fisher said on Wednesday he hopes the new Republican-controlled Congress will limit any new laws that might endanger the Fed's independence. "There are many different arguments being put forward," Fisher said on Bloomberg television, referring to proposals to audit the Fed and force the central bank to follow strict rules for setting interest rates. The Republican win on Tuesday could add momentum to those ideas. "I hope they will be responsible in terms of limiting the amount they wish to interfere with our independence," Fisher said. "I think it is very dangerous to tamper with the institution. Yes, we could be updated and tweaked but on balance we have lasted 100 years and on balance we have done a very good job."

Thomson ReutersA Herbalife logo is shown on a poster at a clinic in the Mission District in San Francisco(This Oct. 31st story corrects attribution for quote in paragraph 13 to "the plaintiffs" from "Judge Beverly Reid O'Connell")  By Devika Krishna Kumar  (Reuters) - Herbalife Ltd  would pay $15 million to settle an 18-month battle over a class action lawsuit brought by a former distributor claiming that the nutrition and supplements company is running an alleged pyramid scheme, according to a U.S. court filing. The company would pay $15 million in cash, plus up to $2.5 million for product returns, according to the court filing that granted preliminary approval for the settlement on Friday. Under terms of the settlement, Herbalife would also make "numerous changes" to its business model for at least three years after the settlement receives final approval, the court filing said. Short-sellers and other critics have accused companies such as Herbalife, NU Skin Enterprises Inc  and USANA Health Sciences Inc  of running pyramid-type schemes, questioning their sales model under which distributors make money not only from their own sales but from people they recruit as distributors. Final court approval is still needed. Dana Bostick, a California housing inspector, filed the lawsuit in April last year, claiming that hundreds of thousands of other distributors have failed to make much money by trying to sell the products. "The potential cost, as well as the distraction, disruption and burden of prolonged litigation on the company and its management team, led the company to decide that the terms set forth in the settlement agreement provided the best path for moving forward," Herbalife said in a statement on Friday. The company said the settlement did not contain an admission of liability or wrongdoing. Herbalife gave Carl Icahn three additional seats on its board earlier this year, after the activist investor openly voiced his support for the company. Pitted against him is the company's most prominent critic, fellow activist William Ackman, who unveiled a $1.16 billion short position against Herbalife in December 2012. Under the agreement, Herbalife must make a number of changes to its corporate policies, including how it defines its distributors, paying shipping charges for products that are legitimately returned by members and making clarifications in its membership agreement to make them less confusing. The product return fund would be available to distributors who file valid claims for the return of unused and unopened products, according to Friday's settlement. The plaintiff lawyers expect to seek fees equal to 30 percent of the combined sum of the settlement amount, the court filing said. "In return for the economic and corporate policy changes provided in the settlement agreement, the settlement class will agree to fully release Herbalife from all claims that were or could have been raised in the complaints in this action," Judge Beverly Reid O'Connell said in the filing. Herbalife shares closed up about 3.7 percent at $52.46 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday. The stock has lost about a third of its value so far this year.

If we forced the poor (and middle class) to save a little more, could we fix wealth inequality in America? That’s what Derek Thompson seems to be saying over at The Atlantic: "Wealth inequality has spiraled out of control for two reasons — middle-class Americans aren't making enough money and they're saving virtually none of it." This is not wrong. Economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman did just release a paper that found that the savings rate for families in the bottom 90% of the wealth distribution in America has fallen sharply since the 1970s, while the savings rate of the top 1% has remained stable. But Thompson argues that the driver of this phenomenon is a lack of will: It didn't have to be this way. Even with stagnating incomes, the rest could have done a better job building and keeping wealth. If the bottom 90 percent had continued to save 3 percent of its income over the 1986-2012 period, its share of US wealth would be a third higher than it is today. It’s essentially blaming non-rich people for not being rich. Did 90% of Americans wake up in the 1980s and say to themselves: "Retirement is for losers. I'm gonna go buy a new TV" (over and over, each paycheck, for 40 years)? Probably not. Saez/ZucmanFigure 11 from the Saez-Zucman paper.Rather, Saez and Zucman say the long period of negative savings rate for 90% of the population from 1998 to 2008 was "due to massive increases in debt (in particular mortgages) fueled by an unprecedented rise in housing prices …" Adding to the debt burden beyond mortgages, the two economists note in another part of the paper, are "student loans, credit cards, and other debt." The key point here is that these debts driving down the savings rate, for the most part, are not optional expenses for the bottom 90%. People need somewhere to live, and they have to keep up with increasing tuition if they want to go to college. Necessary fixed costs increased while incomes stagnated, so saving gave way to debt in order for people to maintain the same lifestyle they had in previous decades.  The bottom 90% then lost out on wealth accumulation, not just because they didn't save money, but because that money then missed out on the kinds of capital gains the rich enjoyed as the stock market surged and their saved money became worth much more. But it is hard to blame people for thinking they should be able to live the same way today as they did yesterday. So is the solution forcing people to save? Thompson thinks one solution is direct deposit, because "somebody with her paycheck directly deposited into a savings account has to take active measures to spend her money." But that assumes people take money out of savings for mostly spontaneous reasons, which is not the case with mortgage and student loan debt. Another proposal of Thompson’s more literally mandates that people save more: Saez and Zucman have another proposal to nudge behavior toward saving: a new automatic retirement plan that skims 3 percent of annual earnings up to $100,000. The money would go into a savings account invested in a broad fund to keep its growth near the global return on capital. Individuals could only take money out of the account early for special reasons, like buying a house or going to school. It's a clever idea. It's also a sign that Americans who aren't rich still must be taught that being wealthy starts with not spending money. This is a rather selective reading of Saez and Zucman’s conclusions. They do suggest the 3 percent plan, after writing that "the best policy to encourage middle-class saving depends on the reasons for the observed drop in the saving rate of bottom 90% of families." We could force people to save, or we could think about boosting income growth, getting serious about consumer protection, and finding ways to stop college tuition from spiraling upward. But that’s a lot harder to do than just blaming the cash-strapped for not having enough cash. FREE AppDownload

Thomson ReutersThe euro sign landmark is seen at the headquarters of the European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt(Reuters) - The European Central Bank can still weaken the euro but only by buying sovereign bonds of the 18 countries that use the single currency, according to a majority of foreign exchange strategists polled by Reuters. The euro &lt;eur=&gt; has already weakened 9 percent against the dollar since the start of this year with most of the fall coming after the ECB announced measures in September aimed at boosting inflation and growth, including purchases of secured debt. The weaker euro and of other stimulus measures have so far failed to bump up inflation, which at 0.4 percent in October is less than a quarter of the ECB's near 2 percent target. Many euro zone economies are already experiencing deflation. The dollar has surged against every major currency in recent months as a solidifying economic recovery in the United States has stoked expectations the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates by the middle of next year. The Fed ended its long-running bond-buying program last week. Wednesday's poll saw the euro steadily weakening against the dollar over the next 12 months but respondents said it may not easily fall much further, especially if there is any moderation in the dollar's rise, unless the ECB eases policy significantly. Buying government bonds is among the last options it has left. Twenty-nine of 38 currency strategists who answered an extra question said the ECB could influence the euro on its own, independent of the Fed's policy decisions. "If the ECB is successful at expanding its balance sheet while that of the Fed stays the same or contracts, then it is in a position to influence the exchange rate of the euro," said Colin Asher, senior economist at Mizuho Corporate Bank. A Reuters poll last week showed the ECB must expand its balance sheet by 1 trillion euros, roughly the size of Mexico's economy but a fraction of what the Fed printed over half a decade, to have an impact on inflation. [ECB/INT] That was in line with President Mario Draghi's suggestion of getting the ECB's balance sheet back to its level of 2012, although national central bankers are unhappy he disclosed a target figure after policymakers agreed not to. "Only with sovereign bonds can the ECB hope to reach the kind of stimulus, in terms of quantity, that's comparable to the United States. No other market in the euro zone is as large," Commerzbank foreign exchange strategist Esther Reichelt said. There is now an even chance the ECB conducts sovereign quantitative easing, or buying bonds with new money, according to a Reuters poll of traders on Monday. [ECB/REFI] The poll of 60 currency strategists conducted this week showed the euro is expected to trade at $1.25 in a month, $1.22 in six months and $1.20 in one year. The consensus level is lower than in last month's poll and in line with positions in the futures market, where speculators heaped short contracts on the euro last week, taking bets against the currency to their largest since July 2012. If the euro does fall as much as predicted by October next year, it would be at its weakest in five years and should help import some inflation into the bloc and stimulate exports. But much depends on commodity and oil prices which can negate a weaker euro's contribution to raising inflation. Global crude oil prices have plunged by $20 a barrel in just seven weeks due to a supply glut in the market. Prices for commodities such as iron ore have also fallen owing to a slowdown in China, by far the largest consumer of raw materials. "The depreciation of the euro, especially against the dollar, has been nearly fully compensated by decreasing industrial and energy commodity prices," said Dag Muller, analyst at SEB. The poll also showed the Japanese yen &lt;jpy=&gt; will weaken to 116.0 per dollar in a year but trade roughly around its current rate of 114.6 over the next six months. The dollar jumped against the yen on Friday after the Bank of Japan surprised markets by increasing its purchases of government bonds and other assets. However, the extra stimulus effectively acknowledges the failure so far of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's ambitious plan to raise inflation in the economy by pumping trillions of yen into the money supply. Economists polled by Reuters cut their annual growth forecast for Japan for a fifth straight month in October, saying there is no chance the BOJ will meet its 2 percent inflation goal by the next fiscal year.

A recent post of mine discussed the importance of understanding your real, real returns (see here).  That is your return after fees and inflation.  We don’t usually hear about this return which is really strange because it’s the money that actually goes into your pocket.  The 10-12% nominal return we often hear about the stock market is not the real, real return and I have no idea why anyone cites such a figure as it plays no realistic role in your life. When we put that 10-12% figure in perspective the stock market actually looks like a far less sexy place to make money.  In fact, the real, real return in stocks over the last 30 years has been just 5.97%.  But what eats away at that top line figure? We all know the story on inflation over the long-term and certainly in recent years.  Historically, it runs about 3.5% although it’s been much lower in recent years.  But it’s still the biggest chunk reducing your returns.  Leaving your assets in cash form is generally a dreadful idea over any sustained period of time, but it’s shocking how many people do this. But what doesn’t get as much attention is the adverse fee effect.  If you’re looking at a real return (after inflation) of 6-7% in stocks then we have every reason to be mindful of any other frictions like taxes and fees that might reduce that return even further.  But what is the average fee effect?  To put things in perspective consider that the average mutual fund charges 0.9% relative to the average low fee index which charges 0.1%.  That’s a 0.8% difference.  It doesn’t sound like much, but take a 7% compound annual growth rate on $100,000 and extend that over 30 years.  Just how much of an impact does it make?  The mutual fund ends up with a balance that is 23% lower than the index.  In other words, the mutual fund could just mimic the return of the index and reduce your return by $150,000. Cullen RocheWhat’s really frightening about this is that most of the 401K space is captured by high fee funds.  As Ben Carlson notes, less than 20% of existing funds in 401K plans have an expense ratio lower than 0.5%: “Less than 20% of these funds offer expense ratios of less than 0.5%, but more than half charge 1% or more in expenses. More than a quarter of these funds still charge more than 1.5% and almost one in ten charges more than 2%. There’s no way that this many funds deserve to be charging this much for their services, especially when you look at the dreadful performance against simple index funds over time.” This is madness.  And I agree with Ben – I don’t just hope it changes.  It needs to change.  Of course, we should be mindful about portfolio construction with the understanding that the“allocation matters most hypothesis” trumps the “cost matters hypothesis”, but fees in this business are ripe to come down.  Way down.  And that’s a good thing.

Thomson ReutersThe United States Federal Reserve Board building is shown behind security barriers in WashingtonWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve unveiled a final rule on Wednesday designed to prevent large financial firms from becoming so big that their failure could shake the core of the U.S. financial market. The final rule, required by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law, prohibits banks and certain large financial firms from acquiring another company if that merger would cause their liabilities to exceed 10 percent of the total consolidated liabilities for all financial firms. The Fed said on Wednesday that its final rule is "substantially similar" to the one it proposed in May, but contains a few changes. For instance, the final rule has an exemption that would permit firms to continue securitization activities even if they have reached the limits set forth in the rule.  (Reporting by Sarah N.

The globe's largest companies are failing to disclose major financial details about their operations in foreign countries, according to a new report. Transparency International (TI), a Berlin based anti-corruption unit, ranked 124 companies on their financial transparency on their operations abroad. UK firms were amongst some of the highest scorers in the report, while tech giants Apple and Google were among the worst offenders. The five companies that were the most unclear about their dealings were (from first to fifth); Bank of China, Honda Motor, Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank of China and Russia's largest bank, Sberbank. US tech giants Amazon and Google were also singled out in the report, along with Apple and IBM, who all received a score of less than three out of 10 in terms of transparency. "Amazon, Apple and Google are among seven US companies whose company leadership doesn't publicly demonstrate support for anti-corruption on their website," the report reads. "Neither Amazon nor Apple say whether they have anti-corruption training for staff. Amazon is the only US company that is silent on its policy on gifts, hospitality and expenses, as well as on the channels it provides for whistleblowers." Cobus de Swardt, TI's managing director, said that these tech companies should be leading the way in transparency: "Tech companies are driving changes that are making our societies more open and accountable. They should be setting an example for other companies on transparency. We hope they will live up to the promise of their products and be more transparent about the way they operate." Transparency International chairman Jose Ugaz added: "We need more transparency from multinational companies, whose power in the world economy closely rivals the biggest countries." "By not responding to people's demands for greater transparency and accountability, companies risk harming their brand and losing customers." Almost three quarters of the 124 companies that were evaluated in the report did not disclose the taxes that they pay in other countries, and half don't publish revenue information from their foreign operations.

Millennials aren't known for being major financial risk-takers, as evidenced by their avoidance of credit cards and preference for cash.  They're equally wary when it comes to investing, particularly after witnessing the perils of the stock market that have made headlines over the last few years. For 20-somethings who are interested in playing the investment game, coming up with the money to do it is usually the hardest part. When you're putting every penny towards student loan debt or trying to make ends meet on an underwhelming entry-level salary, coming up with even a $1,000 can be tough. Once you've gotten the cash together, the next challenge is figuring out what to do with it. Here are some of the best ways to invest $1,000 once you're ready to make the leap. Keeping your cash in a savings account is smarter than just sticking it under the mattress, but you won’t earn a ton of interest based on the current rates. Parking that $1,000 you've been holding onto in a money market instead allows you to snag a slightly better rate while you're researching your other investment options. While you can open a money market at your local bank branch, you may be able to squeeze out a few extra pennies in interest by going with a high-yield account online. Zoe HarrisIt's far away but that doesn't mean you shouldn't be saving for it. If you're just getting your feet wet as an investor, one of the easiest places to start is with your retirement plan. Funneling more money into your 401(k) or opening an IRA is a fairly no-fuss way to put your investment seed money to work. Adding an extra $1,000 to your annual contributions each year may not seem like much but the result is a larger nest egg down the road. For example, say you defer $10,000 of your income into your 401(k) each year. After 25 years, those contributions would be worth right around $500,000, assuming a 5% rate of return. Now, if you were to bump up your deferral to $11,000, you'd see the value of those contributions grow to approximately $551,000. When you consider that it breaks down to roughly $3 a day extra that you're chipping in, it adds up to a pretty decent payoff. Purchasing individual stocks can quickly eat into the money you've set aside to invest, but opting for fractional shares allows you to get the most out of every dollar. You can use your $1,000 to open an account through a platform like ShareBuilder and choose from a variety of investments, including stocks and mutual funds. Scheduling regular deposits to your account, either on a weekly or monthly basis, gives you an opportunity to purchase additional shares without requiring a substantial amount of money. Throwing in another $25 or $50 a month shouldn't be too taxing on your budget and it's a relatively no-hassle way to grow your portfolio. Picking the right stocks is a challenge even when you're a seasoned investor, and for the average 20-something, it may seem downright impossible. Mutual funds, on the other hand, take a lot of the guesswork out of the process but you'll still need to do some research to find the right one. Morningstar is one of the best places to start if you're looking for an in-depth breakdown of a fund's performance. Scottrade is another good source of information. When you're comparing different mutual funds, it's important to consider other things besides the annual return. Some of things you'll want to pay attention to include the level of risk you'd be taking on if you decided to invest $1,000 in a particular fund, the size of the fund, and the different fees that go along with it. Since you're only working with a small amount of cash to start, you want to make sure that a big chunk of it isn't being eaten up by sales commissions or maintenance fees. Mike SchmidPut some money in your own pocket. If you're mired in credit card debt, throwing an extra grand at the balance can make a nice dent in what you owe. Not only that, but you'll be saving yourself some money on the interest. Comparing the amount of interest you’re paying to kind of returns you might expect will give you a better idea of which is the better investment. For instance, if you've got a $5,000 balance at 18% and you pay $250 a month, it'll take you two years to clear the debt and cost you almost $1,000 in interest. Bringing the balance down to $4,000 in one go shaves five months off the repayment time and cuts the interest down by about $400. When you consider that it would take you five years at a 7% annual return to make $400 on a $1,000 investment, it's easy to see which one offers the most immediate results. Deciding to invest $1,000 in yourself may feel a little selfish, but you shouldn't be too quick to dismiss the idea. Using the money to start a side business, build a potentially profitable website, learn a new skill, or take a class that could advance your career or may allow you to reap some big rewards down the road. While there's still a certain degree of risk involved, you have the advantage by knowing what your goals are and what you need to do to maximize the odds of success. FREE AppDownload
Kevork Djansezian / Getty ImagesThe ISM's services index fell to 57.1 in October from 58.6 in September. While this was weaker than the 58.0 expected by economists, it was nevertheless well above the breakeven level of 50. "The New Orders Index registered 59.1 percent, 1.9 percentage points lower than the reading of 61 percent registered in September," the ISM said in its report. "The Employment Index increased 1.1 percentage points to 59.6 percent from the September reading of 58.5 percent and indicates growth for the eighth consecutive month. The Prices Index decreased 3.1 percentage points from the September reading of 55.2 percent to 52.1 " Here are some quotes the ISM gathered from its industry sources: Earlier, we learned Markit's US services PMI fell to 57.1 in October, which was right in line with expectations. This was down from 58.9 in September. "Service sector activity growth reflected robust new business gains in October," Markit noted. "Reports from survey respondents suggested that improving underlying demand and strengthening domestic economic conditions had supported sales volumes. However, the latest expansion of overall new business intakes was slower than the three-month high recorded in September." Click Here For Updates » FREE AppDownload

Bloodbath." Markets weren't too fazed. In fact, the Dow actually hit a new high. First, the scoreboard: And now, the top stories on Tuesday: 1. "It doesn't get old, right?" NYSE floor governor Rich Barry said. "The Dow hit another all-time high this morning and the S&amp;P 500 came within about a point from doing the same." The Dow had its 20th record close of the year. 2. Today's rally comes amid encouraging data on jobs ahead of Friday's official jobs report. According to ADP, US companies added 230,000 private jobs in October. This was up from 225,000 in September, and it was stronger than the 220,000 expected by economists. "The job market is steadily picking up pace," Moody's Analytics' Mark Zandi noted. "Job growth is strong and broad-based across industries and company sizes. At this pace of job growth unemployment and underemployment is quickly declining. The job market will soon be tight enough to support a meaningful acceleration in wage growth.” 3. The ISM services index slipped to 57.1 in October, which was a bit lower than the 58.0 level expected. Still, the number still reflects a healthy pace of growth. What really raised eyebrows was the employment sub-index, which jumped 1.1 points to 59.6, the highest level since August 2005. "This appears to be consistent with payroll growth of 450,000 per month, which is not going to happen," Pantheon Macroeconomics' Ian Shepherdson said. Shepherdson tweaked his model and estimated that the ISM report actually signaled about 300,000 new jobs in October, which is way ahead of the 225,000 forecast by economists surveyed by Bloomberg. 4.

Gold is getting crushed. Again. The yellow metal is at $1,140 per ounce, down by about 2.3%. It got as low as $1,137. This is the lowest level since April 2010. Gold has been dropping to new lows for several weeks as the dollar has strengthened. Oil is another commodity that is tumbling again. WTI crude oil prices dropped as low as $75.84 per barrel shortly after 5 a.m. ET. Brent crude touched $81.63. While this is great for consumers, this is troubling for the oil producers, who may be forced to idle unprofitable projects.

Bloomberg TV via YouTubeJim O'NeillI've spent a good deal of my 35 years as an economic and financial analyst puzzling over Italy. Studying its economy was my first assignment in this business -- as a matter of fact, Italy was the first foreign country I ever flew to. I'm just back from a vacation in Puglia and Basilicata. Over the decades, the question has never really changed: How can such a wonderful country find it such a perpetual struggle to succeed? All the while, Italy has pitted weak government against a remarkably adaptable private sector and a particular prowess in small-scale manufacturing. An optimist by nature, I've generally believed these strengths would prevail and Italy would prosper regardless. In the days before Europe's economic and monetary union, though, it had one kind of flexibility it now lacks: a currency, which it could occasionally devalue. These periodic injections of stronger competitiveness were a great help to Fiat and other big exporters, and to smaller companies too. The rest of Europe had mixed feelings about this readiness to restore competitiveness through devaluation -- meaning at their expense. When discussions began about locking Europe's exchange rates and moving to a single currency, opinions divided among the other partners, notably Germany and France, on what would be in their own best interests. Many German conservatives, including some at the Bundesbank, doubted Italy's commitment to low inflation, which they wanted to enshrine as Europe's chief monetary goal. On the other hand, leaving Italy outside the euro would leave their own competitiveness vulnerable to occasional lira devaluations. In the end, of course, the decision was made to bring Italy in. The fiscal rules that were adopted at the same time -- including the promise to keep the budget deficit below 3 percent of gross domestic product -- can be seen as an effort to force Italy to behave itself. Now and then I wondered if some saw them as a way to make it impossible for Italy to join at all. In any event, Italy found itself doubly hemmed in, with no currency to adjust and severely limited fiscal room for maneuver. The results haven't been good. It's ironic that between 2007 and 2014 Italy has done better than most in keeping its cyclically adjusted deficit under control -- yet its debt-to-GDP ratio has risen sharply. The reason is persistent lack of growth in nominal GDP, itself partly due to an overvalued currency and tight budgetary restraint. Italy is the euro area’s third-largest economy and its third-most populous country. Given this, the scale of its debts and everything we've learned about Europe's priorities during the creation of the euro and since, I've always presumed that, in the end, Germany would do whatever was necessary to protect Italy from the kind of financial blow-up that hit Greece in 2010. Now I am starting to wonder. Italy needs growth in nominal GDP to stop its debt burden from rising any further. Yes, it also needs to reform its economy, raise its productivity and boost its labour force to do this in a lasting way. But as long as it remains a member of the euro system, there'll be no aid from a devalued currency. This means it needs Germany's help -- not just through greater fiscal flexibility, which is essential, but also through a rise in euro-area inflation back to the European Central Bank's target of "below, but close to, 2 percent." It will be almost impossible for the euro area to do this unless Germany itself sees consumer-price inflation rise to that rate or higher. As I travelled around Italy on this latest trip, I imagined a different kind of Germanic rigidity. How about a zero-tolerance approach to inflation that falls below target? Perhaps German citizens should pay an extra tax each year the country experiences inflation that is below but not close to 2 percent -- with the penalty increasing in proportion to the shortfall? The proceeds could be distributed to countries with a cyclically adjusted fiscal deficit of less than 3 percent and less-than-trend GDP growth. Come to think of it, perhaps Italy could impose a punitive tax on German tourists? I know. That would be crazy. But would it be any crazier than insisting on an arbitrary fiscal-deficit rule, unadjusted for the economic cycle -- or letting demand fall so low that Europe misses its inflation target by a mile, and in a way that condemns Italy and others to endless recession? I'd say it's a close call. FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Shannon StapletonAccording to ADP, US companies added a healthy 230,000 jobs in October. This was up from the 225,000 added in September. It was also stronger than the 220,000 expected by economists. "Employment continues to trend upward as we begin the last quarter of 2014, driven mostly by small to mid-sized companies," ADP's Carlos Rodriguez said.

But they also caution against reading to much into the ADP numbers. "The frequent and large revisions to the ADP employment report limit its usefulness in forecasting," Barclays' Jesse Hurwitz said.

Ed Yardeni The ongoing decline in oil prices since the summer reflects a glut of supply rather than a sudden slowing in the global economy, in our opinion. I note that the CRB raw industrials spot price index remains range-bound since 2012, though it is near the bottom of that range. If it dives below it, I will have to reconsider my assessment of the global economy. Here’s a brief rundown on some other recent economic indicators:  (1) Europe. Manufacturing activity in the UK improved in October, while it remained subdued in the Eurozone. The UK’s M-PMI increased for the first time in four months from a 17-month low of 51.5 in September to a three-month high of 53.2 last month, boosted by domestic demand. The Eurozone’s M-PMI ticked up from a 14-month low of 50.3 to 50.6, the third reading just above 50.  (2) China. China’s official M-PMI fell from 51.1 to a five-month low of 50.8 last month. Growth slowed for production (from 53.6 to 53.1) and new orders (52.2 to 51.6), while new export orders (50.2 to 49.9) contracted for the first time in May, albeit slightly. The supplier deliveries measure was unchanged at 50.1. The employment measure ticked up from 48.2 to 48.4, its 29th consecutive reading below 50.  Ed Yardeni Today's Morning Briefing: As The World Turns. (1) Wild ride in S&amp;P 500 Transportation.

ReutersA pedestrian scratching his face is reflected on an electronic board showing exchange rates between (from top row to third row) the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar, the euro, and Australian dollar, and market indices of Dow Jones outside a brokerage in Tokyo November 4, 2014. Sweeping Republican party wins in U.S. mid-term elections pushed the dollar to a seven-year high against the yen and lifted U.S. stock futures on Wednesday, as more soft data from China left oil at its lowest in four years. Republicans rode a wave of voter discontent to secure control of the U.S. Senate and strengthen their grip on the House of Representatives in a punishing blow to President Barack Obama that will limit his power in his last two years in office. For financial markets, the likelihood that that will curb the legislative agenda, or alternatively ensure a greater incentive for comprise between the two sides, was seen as positive. Similar situations in the past have often sparked U.S. stock market rallies. Early futures prices pointed to a 0.3 to 0.4 percent gain for Wall Street when trading opens, while the dollar rose to as high as 114.59 yen, its highest level since December 2007. "We all saw this result coming but the main thing is what the two sides decide, whether they want to co-operate and compromise (on policy) or whether they are going to go back to the trenches," said Philip Marey a U.S.-focused economist at Rabobank. "They (Republicans) have the incentive to be constructive to show to voters that they can rule the country ... If they manage to cooperate it could boost the economy, especially if things can be done on areas like infrastructure." Europe's main stock markets were also on the front foot, rising 0.5-0.9 percent as some encouraging company earnings from Britain to Sweden helped the region shake off the downbeat Chinese purchasing managers' survey that had dominated Asian trading. Growth in China's services sector weakened further in October as new business cooled, reinforcing signs of a gradual economic slowdown that could prod the government to unveil fresh stimulus measures. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 0.5 percent, although Tokyo rose as the yen continued to weaken. For commodities, the China data was the latest blow to the ribs. Brent oil  fell towards $80 a barrel as demand worries mounted. Growth-attuned metal copper hit its lowest in a fortnight and gold slid for a fifth session in six, tumbling to a four-year low below $1,150 an ounce as a strong dollar kept investors away.  "The market is already soft for Brent and the Chinese data is not going to help although the numbers are not a surprise," said Avtar Sandu, senior manager for commodities at Phillip Futures of the Chinese data. It wasn't only China that was spluttering. Euro zone data showed business growth picked up less than expected in October despite much deeper price cutting from firms. Retail sales were also weak and even high-flying neighbour Britain saw its dominant services sector slow. That meant the euro's struggles continued a day ahead of the European Central Bank's monthly meeting. It hit a two-year low against the Swiss franc and slid back below $1.25 against the dollar as sterling also wilted.  REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski European Central Bank (ECB) President Mario Draghi speaks during the bank's monthly news conference in Frankfurt August 7, 2014.As well as bets that feeble euro zone growth and inflation will prompt more action from the ECB in the coming months, sentiment on the shared currency remained uncertain following a Reuters story saying ECB President Mario Draghi's leadership style was upsetting some of the national central banks. "We do not expect further easing at Thursday’s ECB meeting but it may give more insight into its new asset purchase programmes," strategists at Barclays said. The dollar was last buying 114.47 yen, up 0.7 percent at a fresh seven-year peak. The euro was worth just under $1.25. The safe-haven appeal of U.S. Treasury notes left the benchmark 10-year yield hovering at 2.344 percent ahead of U.S. trading, while German and other European bond markets were largely quiet ahead of the ECB meeting.  Russia's rouble hit a new all-time low as the country's central bank finally succumbed to this year's heavy pressure on the currency that has cost it almost $75 billion in reserves. A big rate hike last week had failed to ease the strains so the central bank said on Wednesday it would massively scale down its currency market intervention, meaning the rouble's level will now largely be determined by the market. The continuing drop in the price of oil, which is Russia's biggest revenue earner, remained the big pressure but signs of tensions flaring again in Ukraine added to the strains. Separatist leaders in east Ukraine accused President Petro Poroshenko of violating a peace deal by suspending a law giving their regions a "special status". Russia meanwhile test-fired an intercontinental missile from a submarine in the Barents Sea a day after both Moscow and Kiev had moved troops closer to their joint border. "The central bank of Russia has finally done it," Dmitry Polevoy, chief Russia economist at ING Bank in Moscow said after the change in FX intervention. "The rouble has de facto become a fully flexible currency."   (Editing by Susan Fenton) FREE AppDownload

Aside from the aforementioned, keep an eye on the Builders – ITB had 9 closes just above that 200dma, if it breaks she’ll retreat quick from the high end of the range – Watch the divergence in the Trannies, with Airlines jumping (Lower Oil, No ebola, Good PRASM), while the Rails see profittaking (Lower Oil demand = Lower Oil moving by rail) – Other Scheduled Catalysts include ADP Employment Change at 8:30, Treasury's quarterly refunding announcement at 9, Fed's Kocherlakota Speaks at 9:15, while Fed's Lacker Speaks at 9:30 - Markit US Services PMI at 9:45, and at 10 we get Online Help Wanted Index, ISM Non-Manf, and speak from Fed's Rosengren.   10:30 we get Oil Inventories, and after the closing bell - Bernanke Speaks at an Investor Conference in Denver - Finally, if you are in downtown Annapolis tonight, come join me for a birthday beer at McGarvey’s – I’ll be buying.

Jason DeCrow/APBeyonce, left, holds her "Video of the Year" award while Taylor Swift addresses the crowd at the MTV Music Video Awards on Sept. 13, 2009, in New York.Beyoncé is the highest-paid woman in the music industry this year with estimated earnings of $115 million, more than double her earnings in 2013, Forbes magazine said Tuesday. Last year, the 33-year-old singer had come in at No. 4 on the list, after earning nearly $53 million. Most of Beyoncé’s earnings came from her world tour, during which she performed in 95 shows with an average earning of $2.4 million in each city, Forbes said, citing trade publication Pollstar. Beyoncé’s self-titled album, which released on iTunes in December 2013 and became one of the best sellers of the year, also reportedly helped boost her income. Taylor Swift came in No. 2 with estimated earnings of $64 million from her recorded music and endorsements for CoverGirl, Keds and Diet Coke. According to Nielsen SoundScan, Swift’s new album sold nearly 1.287 million copies last week. “A platinum debut is a phenomenal achievement and even more outstanding given today’s market,” entertainment attorney Lori Landew of Fox Rothschild told Forbes about the 24-year-old’s album “1989.” “Swift and her team have done everything right and seem to have written the playbook on how to tee up a new release,” Landew said. Alecia Beth Moore, better known by her stage name Pink, who rose to fame with her debut solo album “Can't Take Me Home,” came in third with estimated earnings of $52 million. Although the 35-year-old R&amp;B artist may not be as famous as Beyoncé and Swift, she has been striking it big with frequent performances. According to Forbes, Pink played in more than 85 concerts during Forbes’ calculated period and received an average of $1 million in each city. Rihanna came in No. 4 with estimated earnings of $48 million, while Katy Perry ranked fifth with estimated earnings of $40 million. Forbes said that the calculations were based on earnings between June 2013 and June 2014, and data from Pollstar, the Recording Industry Association of America and Nielsen SoundScan also contributed to the annual list.

Thomson ReutersTraders work on the floor of the New York Stock ExchangeNEW YORK (Reuters) - Stock index futures were higher on Wednesday after the Republican Party took control of the Senate in the midterm elections, as had been expected, while investors looked ahead to data expected to show improvement in the labor market. * The beaten-down energy sector will be in focus as the Republican majority could lead to new legislative measures that directly affect the group, including approval of oil and gas pipelines and reforms for crude and natural gas export laws. * The industry has lagged of late, suffering massive losses as crude oil prices recently fell to a three-year low. The S&amp;P energy index &lt;.SPNY&gt; is the only one of the primary S&amp;P 500 sectors to be negative for the year. * Futures rose on relief that the election results were clear, with the upcoming Senate majority party not in doubt. Investors had been concerned that some close races would be forced into run-offs, an outcome that could have led to weeks of delay in knowing who would control Congress's upper chamber. * Investors looked ahead to economic data on the labor market and services sector. At 8:15 a.m. (1315 GMT) the ADP National Employment Report is expected to show that U.S. private employers added 220,000 jobs in October, up from 213,000 in September. At 10 a.m. the Institute for Supply Management's non-manufacturing index is seen dipping by 0.6 point to 58 in October. * A strong ADP report could raise expectations for Friday's closely watched payroll report from the Labor Department, which is expected to show fewer jobs added in October than September. * In company news, FireEye Inc &lt;feye.o&gt; fell 19 percent to $27.80 in premarket trading a day after the cybersecurity company gave a revenue outlook that was largely below expectations. TripAdvisor Inc &lt;trip.o&gt; dropped 12 percent to $72.95 before the bell a day after posting weaker-than-expected earnings. * Activision Blizzard Inc &lt;atvi.o&gt; late Tuesday raised its full-year forecast on robust sales of its videogame "Destiny."   (Editing by Chizu Nomiyama) FREE AppDownload

Thomson ReutersA security guard walks under the logo of Toyota Motor Corp in TokyoTOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp &lt;7203.T&gt; raised its full-year operating profit forecast by 9.1 percent on Wednesday as a sharp decline in the yen against increases the value of repatriated earnings and makes up for lower vehicle sales. The world's biggest automaker now expects operating profit of 2.50 trillion yen ($21.87 billion) for the business year ending March 31, rather than the previously forecast 2.30 trillion yen, thanks partly to a 135 billion yen contribution from foreign exchange gains. It sees sales at 9.05 million vehicles instead of 9.10 million. Toyota also revised its net profit estimate to 2.00 trillion yen from 1.78 trillion yen. Net profit includes earnings made with joint venture partners in China. "Of course exchange rates helped, but we also made efforts to offset negatives such as a rise in fixed costs, with cost-cutting and sales efforts," Executive Vice President Nobuyori Kodaira told a news conference. The Japanese currency passed 113 yen to the dollar this week for the first time since December 2007 after Japan's central bank eased its already-loose monetary policy. Toyota adjusted its dollar rate assumption for the full year to 104 yen from 101 yen, leaving more room for profit growth is the yen stays weak. In July-September, an 8 percent fall in the yen combined with cost-cutting to help Toyota book record second-quarter earnings. Toyota reported an 11.3 percent rise in second-quarter operating profit to 659.22 billion yen, compared with the 650.7 billion yen average estimate of 13 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net profit rose 23 percent to 539.06 billion yen. The automaker has been enjoying strong sales in the United States, its biggest market, spurred by economic recovery, easy access to financing and lower gasoline prices. It raised its sales forecast for North America slightly, to 2.74 million vehicles from 2.71 million. But uncertainty looms over the market in China, where Japanese peers Honda Motor Co &lt;7267.T&gt; and Nissan Motor Co &lt;7201.T&gt; cut sales outlooks over the past week citing a sluggish economy. Toyota aims to boost China sales by at least a fifth to over 1.1 million vehicles this year. Unlike Honda and Nissan, Toyota and joint venture partners China FAW Group Corp [SASACJ.UL] and Guangzhou Automobile Group Co Ltd &lt;601238.SS&gt; &lt;2238.HK&gt; have seen sales gain over the past few months. Shares in Toyota ended up 0.1 percent ahead of the earnings announcement, compared with a 0.4 percent rise in Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei average &lt;.N225&gt;.   (Reporting by Mari Saito; Editing by Christopher Cushing) FREE AppDownload

Markit's eurozone PMI Composite Output Index — which is based on a survey of thousands of companies — inched higher to 52.1 in October, up from 52.0 in September. Although this signals the 16th consecutive month that output grew (any number above 50 indicates growth), it wasn't all positive news.  "Spain and Germany all reported increases in new business, but this was partly offset by contractions in Italy (fastest in 11 months) and France (steepest in 16 months)," the Markit report said.  The eurozone's services industry fell to 52.3 in October, down from 52.4 in September.  Chris Williamson, Chief Markit Economist said: "The eurozone PMI makes for grim reading, painting a picture of an economy that is limping along and more likely to take a turn for the worse than spring back into life. While output grew at a slightly faster rate than in September, consistent with quarterly GDP growth of 0.2%, a near- stagnation of new orders, with the worst reading for 15 months, suggests that the pace of growth may deteriorate in coming months."
