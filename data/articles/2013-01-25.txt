Business InsiderThe hot ticket in Davos this evening is a "taxidermy" party thrown by billionaire entrepreneur Sean Parker, Salesforce.com CEO Mark Benioff, and Ian Osborne of the London-based communications firm Osborne &amp; Partners. Billed as the "Future Of Philanthropy Nightcap," the party is being held in what was until recently a crappy bar on Davos's main drag. I say "until recently," because earlier this week Sean Parker's team took control of the place and went to work on it. Sean Parker designed all the renovations and picked out the decorations himself. And in 48 hours, the bar has been transformed into a one-of-a-kind "taxidermy" emporium, with stuffed animals and animal heads on many of the walls. There's a wine bar in one corner. And a team of bartenders called "Liquid Chef" juggling drinks (to mix them) behind another expansive bar. John Legend is playing. There are said to be three levels of restricted rooms below the main level that only certain guests have access to. And there is, as you will see, a very eclectic mix of guests. I generally feel about two decades too old to fully appreciate parties like these, but tonight's guests included some folks who were two decades younger and some who were two decades older than me. So I actually felt quite at home. Here are some pictures. Apologies in advance for the lousy quality. I'll post some video tomorrow.
"[N]et income for fiscal year 2012 is expected to be approximately 20% lower than net income for fiscal year 2011," they wrote. According to Yahoo Finance, analysts were expecting earnings to climb around 8 percent from last year's earnings of $3.49 per share. Among other things, management blamed Hurricane Sandy, the election, the fiscal cliff, and warm weather. Jos. A Bank's sales strategy centers around marking its suits up and then offering abnormally large discounts through outrageous promotions. However, this model may have revealed its first cracks. "...our customers (specifically at our stores) didn't respond as well to our promotional offers as they had in the past," they wrote. SEE ALSO: How Jos. A Bank Makes Money Buy Selling 1 Suit And Giving 7 Away For Free &gt; ------------------------------------------------------- Here's the full release via Yahoo Finance: HAMPSTEAD, Md., Jan. 25, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- JoS. A. Bank Clothiers, Inc. (JOSB) announces that net income for fiscal year 2012 is expected to be approximately 20% lower than net income for fiscal year 2011. Actual results will depend on, among other things, sales for the remainder of the year, expenses and normal year-end processing. Fiscal year 2012 is a 53-week year which will end February 2, 2013; fiscal year 2011 was a 52 week year which ended January 28, 2012. Commenting on the earnings update, R. Neal Black, President and CEO of JoS. A. Bank Clothiers, Inc. stated: "Total company sales for the year will be up, but not enough to offset higher marketing expenses and lower gross margin. We are disappointed that we were not able to drive the sales gains we had expected. The fourth quarter started out slowly, as the first two weeks of fiscal November were negatively impacted by the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, the distractions created by the presidential election and the uncertainty of the fiscal cliff. Going into the critical holiday selling season, starting on Black Friday, we believed we had a strong marketing and promotional strategy for the period. However, many of the promotional items and a large part of our holiday assortment were items that sell best in cold weather and the weather was unseasonably warm. Historically, we have had strength with these types of items, but our customers (specifically at our stores) didn't respond as well to our promotional offers as they had in the past. Our customers responded well to our suit promotions during this period, but our non-suit customers responded poorly to our holiday season offerings, even at very low prices on products such as sweaters, outerwear, hats, gloves, scarves, and jackets made of heavier fabrics such as camel's hair and cashmere. On the positive side, our Direct Marketing business continues to perform well, with double-digit sales growth so far for the fourth quarter. Despite the disappointing earnings results on a year-over-year basis, the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2012 will still be very profitable." "The Company continues to maintain solid cash flows and a strong balance sheet. Additionally, during fiscal year 2012 we achieved several positive accomplishments. We opened our 600th store during the year, opened a total of 46 new stores in fiscal year 2012 and expect to open between 45 and 50 new stores in fiscal year 2013. We have continued to grow our new business initiatives such as our tuxedo rental and big and tall businesses which are starting to gain critical mass. And, for the first time we exceeded the $1 billion annual sales milestone in fiscal year 2012. We continue to remain very positive about the Company's long-term prospects," stated Mr. Black.
paularps / FlickrThe government managed to get us passed the "fiscal cliff." But they did so by creating three more smaller, but still substantial "cliffs." And according to Morgan Stanley's Vincent Reinhart we're likely to go over one of those cliffs, and it's unclear what the consequences will be. First, let's review how we got passed the "fiscal cliff."  Reinhart summarizes in a new research note: The “resolution” of the sudden stop in the federal fiscal position that had been legislated for the end of 2012 created three risk events.  First, on or about March 1, the Treasury was forecast to run out of room under its statutory limit to borrow and run out of cash in its account at the Federal Reserve.  Second, absent legislative intervention, on March 1, sequestration kicks in, imposing across-the-board cuts in discretionary spending.  And on March 27th, budgetary authority to operate the government under a continuing resolution lapses, implying that the federal bureaucracy will have to cease the provision of all non-essential services. On Wednesday, the House of Representatives passed a bill to suspend the debt ceiling.  And many are assuming some sequestration to hit. However, Reinhart thinks that we are likely to see a government shutdown, or the freezing of non-essential services.  And because the market has gotten used to fiscal brinksmanship, a shutdown could be bad news because the markets don't appear to have priced in the drag on the economy and shock to confidence. From Reinhart: The odds favor a government shut-down.  The experience of 1995 to 1996 reassures that the world will not end.  However, the drag on spending will likely be more significant than market participants expect.  With the countdown clocks on cable television put back into motion, consumer confidence could take a hit.  And, as always, the ratings agencies are a wild-card that could make this more of a market event, even if short lived. Circling back to the start, the conversation at the policy-making scrum at the Conference Center at Davos shows the key problem for the US and Europe.  Market observers are bored by the details of the political debate.  Trained by last-minute bargains on both sides of the Atlantic, everyone assumes that nothing can go seriously wrong and compromise will win at the end.   If nothing can go seriously wrong, it should not be embedded in market prices.  And if market prices are not sending at least a yellow flashing signal of threat, politicians believe they have time to act.  Politicians who think they have time to act use it.  And what happens to market confidence in the absence of political action? We will find out. We can hope for the best. SEE ALSO: The '1994 Moment' Is Keeping More And More Bond Traders Awake At Night &gt;
Bloomberg, @fullcarry, Business InsiderThe pickup in the economic data in the U.S. lately and the Federal Reserve's recent musings on tightening monetary policy have many wondering if bond markets are set to repeat a "1994 scenario." In 1994, the economy was emerging from a big recession, and Treasury yields began to rise slightly from their 1993 lows as the growth outlook improved – though no other signs of inflation had yet emerged. Taking their cue from rising yields, Alan Greenspan and the Fed surprised markets by beginning to tighten monetary policy, and Treasuries plunged as interest rates screamed higher throughout the year. Given the recent rise in Treasury yields after a sustained period at low levels – the same impetus for the Fed's tightening in 1994 – many wonder if the stage is set for another bloodbath in fixed income markets. One experienced bond trader who got his start in 1993 sent us the chart above, annotated with an arrow and the comment, "We could be here."
Today is the last day that Tim Geithner will be Treasury Secretary. The Treasury Department has a blog post that highlights Tim’s contributions. Coming from his co-workers, you’d expect fluff and accolades, and that is what was dished up (I’m sure Tim edited every word). The post lists 75 “accomplishments”. I found a few of those interesting. "64. He played basketball with Chinese high school students in Beijing and swung a cricket bat in India. Swell... "55. Secretary Geithner and the President fought for and extended the payroll tax cut at the end of 2011 payroll tax cut despite fierce opposition. Yeah, Tim fought hard for spending bucks during the big election year. What happened 6 weeks after the election? Tim and Obama ramped those payroll taxes back up. # 55 should read:“TG got the PR tax extended, it proved to be a factor in the election. It was good deal for the Administration, it only cost the taxpayers $125 billion.” "59. During Secretary Geithner’s tenure, Treasury chaired the Partnership for Arab Countries in Transition, and initiating other measures to strengthen institutions and markets in support of the Arab Spring. I’m thinking Tim’s bank, The Federal Financing Bank, was making loans for weapons? Anyway, it’s hard to look at N. Africa and the rest of the ME and call it a success. Bruce Krasting And while we’re on the topic of the FFB, how about all the other stuff that happened under Tim’s watch? Bruce Krasting Bruce Krasting  Bruce Krasting "58. During Secretary Geithner’s tenure, Treasury deepened its relationship with Chinese leaders Egad…. Bruce Krasting    "57. Secretary Geithner repeatedly made the moral case for ending the high-income tax cuts Moral case? "54. Secretary Geithner was one of the principal negotiators with Congress during the bipartisan December 2010 tax compromise. Yes, yes – but  – Where was he on the crucial negotiations on the Debt Limit in July 2011? We got a downgrade that Tim said would never happen, the economy and markets tanked because of that fiasco. The T-Sec was decidedly missing in that mess.That is what should he is remembered for. 53. Secretary Geithner was part of the economic team that developed the comprehensive, specific set of proposals in the Presidents FY 2013 Budget….. Please! Spare me!The US has not had a budget for a single day that Tim has been running the show. That is a disgraceful result. 49. During Secretary Geithner’s tenure, the Treasury building became what is believed to be the oldest building in the world to receive a Leadership in Energy Design Gold certification. The folks at Treasury digging deep to connect Tim to the environment with this. My bet is Tim has no clue how the building is heated. Like most of the stuff from D.C.; form over substance. "47. Secretary Geithner ordered the elimination of the minting of the dollar coins. Unbelievable….. The coins were costing $50m a year and no one wanted them. Any idiot could have seen this. Tim takes credit for the obvious. "46. ..the weighted average maturity of Treasury securities is now at its longest level in a decade – and is up nearly 33 percent since October 2008. Tim’s taking credit for this? This could never have happened were it not for Bernanke QEing for the entire time Tim was selling paper. What the Treasury does not give Tim proper credit for is the increase in Debt. In Tim’s 1,460 days debt increased $5.8 TRILLION! A , a 182% increase!! "45.  During Secretary Geithner’s tenure, Treasury proposed more than $1.1 billion in savings. Yes, but actually only achieved half of that. Geithner spent $50B in his four years just turning the lights on at Treasury. The damn IRS is costing $12B a year! For bean-counters! "41. During Secretary Geithner’s tenure, Treasury worked to support lending for families. For example, more than 1 million student loans…. Tim looks at this an accomplishment. I look at as an off-balance sheet stimulus to the economy. I think Tim abused student lending. I think Tim set the country up for another Fannie Mae experience, where taxpayers will eat a loss due to government lending. Bruce Krasting "39. Secretary Geithner has pushed the regulatory agencies with rulewriting authority to move quickly but diligently in implementing Wall Street reform.  Bruce Krasting "9.  During Secretary Geithner’s tenure, Treasury completed the wind down of the portfolio of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) it acquired as part of its response to the financial crisis. Great! Tim Sold the Bonds to the Fed! To say that this is an accomplishment is a deception. "13.  Secretary Geithner will be the eleventh longest serving Treasury Secretary in the Department’s history. This is an accomplishment. I can’t believe he made it this long. I think he should have been dumped after the Turbo Tax problem. "10.  Secretary Geithner has made 24 appearances on Sunday morning talk shows. And in every one of them he had a smarmy, know-it-all attitude. Bruce Krasting "16.  Secretary Geithner was born in New York City but spent much of his childhood outside the United States in Zimbabwe…." …..where he first became enamored with devaluing a currency to achieve “success”. Bruce Krasting Anyway, I feel like I owe Tim some thanks. He gave me a bunch of stories the last few years. Most of those were at Tim’s expense. Like in the the Godfather, it was only business, nothing personal.
There has been an burst of exuberance as of late as the market, after four arduous years, got back to its pre-crisis levels.  Much has been attributed to the recent burst of optimism in the financial markets from: 1) Better than expected earnings - not counting the fact that expectations had been dramatically lowered over the last quarter.  If you lower the bar enough you will get better results.  However, if expectations levels had remained where they were previously every single report would have missed so far. 2) Stronger economic growth ahead - expectations are once again, as we have seen over the last 3 years, that the economy will grow at 3% or better in the coming year.  Unfortunately, most of the economic data suggests that 2013 will remain mired closer to 2% after a very lackluster first half of the year. 3) The end of the bond bubble is near - like the economy; bond bears have been calling for the end of bond bubble.  Will 2013 be the year?  Most likely not as the chase for yield continues as masses of baby boomers move into retirement needing income to maintain their standard of living. 4) The long term outlook is getting better - this is true but how much of the long term outlook is already priced in?  How much of the long term outlook is due to artificial stimulus versus organic economic growth?   5) Valuations are cheap - the argument of cheap valuations is a hollow one.  First, comparing forward operating earnings expectations to trailing reported GAAP earnings is apples and oranges.  Using the Shiller 10-year median P/E - valuations are at levels normally associated with bull market peaks.  Secondly, the argument of earnings yield compared to bond yields is garbage.  Bond yields are being artificially suppressed which distorts the argument from reality.  Furthermore, investors do not receive the earnings yield from stocks but they DO receive the interest income from bonds. 6) The great rotation is here - for the third year in a row we are once again hearing that the "mountains of cash" piled on the sidelines is about to flow into the markets.  That has yet to happen and there is little indication as of yet that 2013 will be any different. The point to made here is that each time the market has rallied the media, and analysts, try to attribute the rally to a fundamental support.  In most cases the arguments boil down to"hope" more than "reality."   However, what is really driving the current rally is likely far more simplistic:  $85 billion a month. With the Federal Reserve currently engaged in two simultaneous quantitative easing programs (QE 3 and 4) totaling $85 billion a month in purchases of both mortgage backed and treasury bonds - the excess reserve accounts of the banks have soared in recent weeks.   There is a very high historical correlation (85%) between the expansion of the Fed's balance sheet and the stock market. The chart below shows the relationship between the financial market and the expansion/contraction of excess reserves held by banks.  Historically, these excess reserves, prior to 2008, averaged about 18.9 billion.  Today those excess reserves amount to $1.58 Trillion. Lance Roberts/Street Talk Live Each market rally is always expected to continue indefinitely into the future.  The reality is that this is never the case and that the inevitable correction is always completely "unexpected."  The current rally, as shown in the next chart and table, will likely proceed along the same course as we have seen with each previous QE program.  Our current target for the rally is 1560 on the S&amp;P 500 which would be an 11% return from the start of QE3.  Should this target be reached it will continue the pattern of diminished rates of return as these liquidity driven surges have become more fully priced into the markets. Lance Roberts/Street Talk Live It is clear that the visible hand of the Federal Reserve is firmly in control of the markets at the moment as liquidity flows are increased. However, extrapolating the current advance indefinitely into the future becomes somewhat dangerous.  Each previous program cycle has ended with a fairly nasty decline, in both the markets and the economy, as the fundamental drivers were being supported solely by artificial interventions.  Those declines would have likely been far worse had they not been halted by the next round of "liquidity injected goodness."    While the Fed programs that we have witnessed since the financial crisis are historically unique - liquidity driven markets are not.  We have witnessed the effects of excess liquidity in the bull market cycle prior to the 2008 financial crisis.  The only difference during that cycle was that, through government intervention, real estate was turned into an ATM allowing mortgage equity withdrawals to be the liquidity source for the economy and the markets.  The chart below shows the extremely high correlation between these two bull market cycles. Lance Roberts/Street Talk Live There are many similarities between the peak of the market in 2008 and today.  Investor sentiment is pushing extreme levels, the markets are exceedingly overbought, earnings are weakening, complacency is higher, multiples are expanding, the consumer is beginning to sputter and headlines are beginning to push the boundaries of manic optimism. One doesn't haven't to think back too far to remember that at the peak of the markets in 2008 there was no recession in sight, even though it had already started, as it was a "goldilocks"economy.  Earnings were expected to continue to grow into the coming year and equities were the only investment of choice.  Come to think of it - that is what we heard in 1999 as well.   David Rosenberg summed this up well in his most recent missive: "As imperfect souls, we as human beings simply don't see that the existing situation will somehow be resolved and come to an end, and that in the ensuing three to five years, we will either be belly aching over a new bear market or celebrating a bull phase.  And in either case, it's called 'living in the moment.'  But the most dangerous thing anyone can do is extrapolate the most recent experience, as enduring as it may seem, into the future.  Good, bad or indifferent, we will be talking about something completely different three to five years from now than we have been for the past number of years." The point here is that there are times when one should step back to look at the forest for the trees.  The catalysts that brought the financial markets to its knees in 2000-2002 or 2008-2009 will likely not be the same ones in the future.  Will the markets continue to play out as the chart above potentially forecasts?  I haven't a clue.  With the Fed fully engaged in stimulus programs domestically, as well as the ECB and Japan globally, there is excess liquidity sloshing throughout the financial system.  The market rally could well rise farther, for longer, than most would expect possible.   The current belief is that the central banks will have the foresight to withdraw the stimulus before the next bubble is formed, unfortunately, there is no historical precedent that supports that claim.  However, with the markets fully inflated, we have reached the point that where even a small exogenous shock will likely have an exaggerated effect on the markets.  There are times that investors can safely "buy and hold" investments - this likely isn't one of them.
He announced his plan to turn things around at the struggling department store. Johnson was JCPenney's white knight. He had joined the retailer in late 2011, leaving his high-profile job as the retail chief at Apple.  The brilliant mind behind the magnificent success of the Apple Store was supposed to be the century-old chain's savior.  It's not nearly over yet — his plan called for a few years of transition. But now, it has been one year since Johnson gave that presentation.  JCPenney's stock is down 53 percent since then.
YoutubeMiriam Villae never knows what she'll find on the shelves of her grocery store in the Venezuela capital these days. Chances are it's not much. As the oil-rich country grapples with the highest food shortage in four years, the 62-year-old grandmother and many others like her are being forced to make do without staples like flour and butter. "Today I found corn meal and oil but there's no sugar," Villae told AFP as she slipped two packages of maize into her cart at a Caracas supermarket -- much to the delight of her young grandson. "Wheat flour has long been missing," she added, noting that, day after day, she comes to "hunt" for chicken. "Is there butter, is there butter?" asked another woman excitedly as both she and Villae gingerly tried to dodge the long lines of shoppers that formed as word spread about the delivery of oil, rice and the all important corn meal, used to make arepas and empanadas. In December, the Central Bank said its scarcity index, which tracks the percentage of consumer goods missing from grocery store shelves, rose to a four-year high of 16.3 percent in December. In light of the situation, some supermarkets and bakeries are restricting the amount people can buy. Some Caracas restaurants are even cutting back on their menu offerings. "January is always a tricky month because distributors go on vacation in December but by mid-month inventories are usually restocked," said Edgar Parra, manager of a sparsely stocked grocery store in Caracas where customers scrounged for items. "Not this time around." The government, which earlier this year launched a plan to prevent shortages and introduced price controls in 2003, blames the bare shelves on an increase in consumption -- along with hoarding by producers and speculators. Led by ailing leader Hugo Chavez, who has not been seen in public for weeks after leaving the country to undergo cancer surgery in Cuba, the government alleges that the private sector is trying to force an increase in prices and a devaluation of the official exchange rate. "They have proposed that prices be freed, that foreign exchange controls be ended and that state-owned enterprises be privatized," Vice President Nicolas Maduro, Chavez's designated heir, said recently. Officials have also accused the opposition of trying to destabilize the country amid political uncertainty in the absence of Chavez, the once omnipresent and outspoken leftist firebrand who missed his inauguration to a third six-year term on January 10 due to poor health. But analysts, such as Luis Vicente Leon, head of the Datanalisis polling firm, disagreed. "Obviously, the Venezuelan economy is full of hoarders and speculators, they're the product of the controls and the hostility," he tweeted. "The real problem is there are not enough products to meet demand." Roberto Leon, president of the ANAUCO consumer advocacy association, pointed to multiple causes -- including a high dependence on food imports and bureaucratic hurdles. "Public policies should change," he said.
Fannie MaeYou hear it all the time from ads and realtors.Â  But this time it's actually true: there has literally never been a better time to buy a home. According to the latest data from the National Association of Realtors, the home affordability index has now entered its third year of record highs. The measure tracks median income against median priced homes (assuming a down payment of 20 percent of the home price and it assumes a qualifying ratio of 25 percent). AÂ value of 100 means that a family at median income has exactly enough income to qualify for a mortgage on a median-priced home.Â  When it's above 100, the family has more than enough income to qualify. And the current reading is just under 200. But we wanted to dig in to why housing conditions in America are so ripe for buying.Â

APMikhail Khodorkovsky in a Moscow court in 2004. Relations between Russia and the U.S. have recently hit a rough patch. In December, Congress passed the Magnitsky Act, which will create a black list of Russian officials suspected of human rights abuses. Hermitage Capital founder William Brouder had lobbied for years for the legislation, which is named after Sergei Magnitsky, a Hermitage-lawyer who died in a Moscow jail after accusing officials of involvement in an enormous tax fraud. Before the list could even be finalized, however, the Russian Duma hit back with its own legislation seeking to ban the adoption of Russian children by U.S. families. Russian media had complained about high profile cases of abuse for years, but the timing and severity of the legislation made it clear this was retaliation. Given that just a few years ago we were talking about a U.S.-Russia "reset" in relations, the whole thing seems like a remarkable step backwards for the two countries. Add to that an ongoing clampdown on dissent in the country — most notably in the case of the anti-Putin feminist group Pussy Riot — and strict new legislation on homosexuality, the situation in Russia looks dark. For insight on the matter, we talked to Pavel Khodorkovsky, the head of the Institute of Modern Russia and the son of a bitter enemy of President Vladimir Putin. Pavel's father, Mikhail, was once Russia's richest man, head of the enormous Yukos oil company with a personal fortune of $15 billion. A public spat with President Vladimir Putin, however, left him as one of Russia's most famous prison inmates — and one of Putin's most outspoken critics. Pavel hasn't been back to Russia since his father's arrest, but keeps in close correspondence with Mikhail, monitoring events in Russia. He explained how the adoption ban seemed to be a bargaining chip for Russia, and one that Russian orphans would lose out from. He admitted that his family's hope for the Russian opposition had initially been high, but that the Kremlin's clampdown means "criteria by which we judge the progress will have to change." Finally, he explained why the Magnitsky Act was so important, not just in the Hermitage Capital case, but also for other jailed dissidents, such as his father. The transcript of our conversation with Pavel, lightly edited for clarity, is below. The first thing to talk about is the U.S. adoption ban in Russia. Were you surprised at how quickly that went through and with so little opposition? Institute of Modern Russia / FacebookPavel KhodorkovskyI think the legislators in Russia have quickly realized that they're really not going to achieve anything with the original piece of legislation [a Russian black list for U.S. officials] because not many state officials travel to Russia. I don't think that McCain is going skiing in the Ural Mountains anytime soon. It's just a futile effort at retaliation. And I think there was this idea — I actually don't believe that it was coming from the Kremlin — to create an additional lever. Basically create a negotiating avenue, something that people would care about in the U.S., and that became the adoption ban. You know the statistics — 60,000 kids were adopted over the course of the last 10 years. Nineteen cases, yes, tragedies. But compare that to 1,500 kids who are dying in orphanages every year in Russia, and those are just the official statistics, taken straight out of the website of the general prosecution office. It certainly looks like they have a much better chance of getting proper medical care, and frankly surviving, here in the U.S. I think 1 out of 10 adoptions from foreign countries in the U.S. is from Russia, and 1 out of 3 from Russia to foreign countries is to the U.S. I think that played a lot into this idea. I didn't think it was going to pass. It was going to fly through the United Russia Party but there was going to be opposition. And then it flew through all the three readings, almost unanimously voted for. I actually think that Putin did not initiate this. It's one of those situations where the head of the gang has to be the biggest, toughest member of the gang. He cannot show any mercy, any weakness. His group had no other choice but to sign that. If you remember in the press conference on the 20th or 21st, he was still very undecided, he got like eight questions about it and he couldn't give a straight answer. He said everything short of I'll sign it, and then seven days later he signed it.I was surprised. It was primarily aimed at achieving leverage over the United States. I would hate it to become one of those trading points — we'll not include a member of the Russian bureaucracy on the Magnitsky list, and you'll let out 10 kids. Do you think there's much public support for it in Russia? Do you think the average Russian citizen supports it or even cares about it? It falls into the background that's been fostered over the past 10 years of anti-Americanism. It depends on how you ask the question. If you ask the question, do you want your kids to have a better chance of good medical care if they're adopted by a foster family from abroad, you'll get a different response from do you want Russian kids to go to the U.S.? The statistics that everyone is citing — the 56 percent in favor of the adoption ban — is from a government statistical analysis organization. I'm sure that the question was asked in a very predetermined way. They said that 25 percent are undecided — I find that very hard to believe. A quarter of the population cannot be undecided on such an issue. This is such a polarizing issue. You should be getting single digits. Look at any other issues of that magnitude, you'll see the population completely split. And here you have a quarter versus 56 percent, in favor versus against, so those numbers seem wrong. If the question was asked properly, and actually people have the full statistics that go along with it — that the majority of kids who are being adopted by U.S. parents have some sort of sickness or come from an ethnically diverse background and have very little chance of being adopted [there would be higher approval]. There are these orphans and orphanages in Russia that are of Tartar, Kyrgyz, Kazakh origin, and, frankly, they're not popular with Russian foster parents. And Americans, they go, it's a long process and they have to work with the agency, and they go to the orphanages. And year after year they see the same kids, and oftentimes families adopt more than one. A family that we're friends with adopted two kids from Russia and they are United States citizens. They adopted one kid, and then they kept coming back for another two years and then they finally adopted her when she was three years old. And when you actually lay out these facts, I think you would get a completely different response. Obviously this is a response from the Magnitsky Act. I know that Bill Brouder is pushing for an EU-wide list. If such a plan went into place, would you expect another retaliatory action from Putin or the Duma? It's a lot more damaging to spoil relations with European nations than with the U.S., because there's a lot of trade. And the fact that Russia has for a while now been trying to get visa-free access. So retaliatory measures would be a lot more damaging to Russia itself. So I don't believe that there would be. But I believe there would be a lot of lobbying in the meantime to prevent it. This is one of Putin's biggest check-marks that he hasn't checked off — getting visa-free access. If he can get one of the countries in the Schengen zone to pass legislation that would impede access to any of the bureaucrats in the Schengen zone, that would be a disaster for him. So he would most certainly lobby hard.  The EU passed a resolution last year for a Magnitsky-type measure. But the resolutions of the Parliament of the EU are not legally binding on member states, so you can't have an EU-wide law.  AP Photo/Ivan SekretarevDo you think you've seen any change in Kremlin policies since Putin returned to the presidency? Domestically, most certainly. Internationally, well he ditched the G8 summit, which was probably an unwise thing to do. But it shows how in the first few months, he wasn't sure how he was going to be received, so he avoided it. Domestically, we've seen a huge change. We've seen a more subdued style of repression to a complete reversal. All of the legislative initiatives introduced in the spring of last year were basically flushed down the drain. The registration for the parties became completely balanced out by a new law that prevents any foreign funding to NGOs, prohibits United States citizen from being employed in any organization that deals with politics, and another law that interprets consulting for foreign government as essentially treason. So all of this has completely balanced out the positive. And the return to the free elections of governors has been diluted to its most ineffective form. And on the streets you see that Putin has chosen to repress people. Thirteen cases from Lubyanka Square in May are in court. Some of these people have not even participated in the protest, but most of these people will most likely get sentences. We have two criminal cases against [Alexey] Navalny and [Sergei] Udaltsov. Today, Navalny has been yet another time to the prosecutor's office and he has met this new team of investigators — now 11 people. And he has received the final version of the charges against him. And he's accused of stealing 16 million from KirovLes. There's certainly a trend of embroiling the opposition leaders in these legal battles and sapping them of their efforts to do anything else. How do you feel the opposition leaders are doing? This time last year, we were talking about protests in Moscow, Pussy Riot, international news. Now, we have these kind of clamp-downs. Do you still have hope for the opposition movement? I do, but the criteria by which we judge the progress will have to change. We finally have some form of proper organization — I'm speaking of the Opposition Council. It's slowly but finally starting to work, and there's finally some cohesion. But obviously we've lost the momentum on the street. But I'm optimistic because once again, to give you an example — you might have read the comment by Masha Gessen, that when there was an adoption protest in Moscow, that there haven't been that many creative posters, placards, that it's been kind of predetermined. But I don't see it as a negative. Creativity on the street is great when you want to pass it around the social networks and laugh at the funny posters and condoms on the street in response to Putin's comments — that's great. When you want to have a sustained movement, you need to have some sort of organization. And that's exactly what Putin's camp has been doing. Look at the crowds of 120,000 that have been dragged out from neighboring cities — they've been celebrating Putin's win. They rally people, they sometimes pay money to organizations to let their employees off work for the day, pay for their meals, sponsor their tickets to Moscow — they sponsor everything just to drag people out. And I'm not saying opposition has to employ the same tactics, but it needs the same structure. The underlying reasons haven't gone away — the government has done nothing to address the reasons for discontent that have bubbled up last winter. We have the same problem with elections — we've had the Khimki elections. We've had the same reports coming out of the polling stations of the alleged fraud. We've had pretty much the same tactics employed in that election. So nothing has really changed in the way the government is responding to people's concerns. And that's just focusing on the actual election procedures. And then we have stuff like the Pussy Riot sentence, and the Taisia Osipova sentence — eight years — four more than what the prosecutors have asked for. And now we have potential sentencing for these people from Bolotnaya square — and this is all going to continue to rattle the society, because not much positive has happened in the course of the last year. And I think the reason that they're not doing much is that they're counting on the repression tactics to scare off the crowds. Also they're looking forward to the next year — February 2014, we're hosting the Sochi Olympics and they're hoping that will boost the national morale. I don't know if that will be a big success because the construction is in complete disarray. But I think this is the plan, to ignore the short-term concerns and to go full-steam ahead to big events, full-steam ahead to Sochi, let's get the national pride restored. But that's not going to address the concerns of a major part of the population. This is going to be the 10th anniversary of your father's incarceration. How is he interpreting the changes in Russia? You know he's been offered to participate in the elections for the opposition council. But he's declined, because he thinks he wouldn't be much use. He would probably win a seat, but the communication lag would make it impractical. And people are criticizing him, saying 'you're not prepared to side with any opposition movement.' But that's not true — he's in communication with a lot of the leaders of the opposition movement, and he hasn't been hiding any of his preferences. And he's made very direct comments addressing current events. he's very happy that the council has taken organizational shape and form. He's a manager. He knows how to organize the process and he understands the organizational benefits, and that's a big plus in his book. Overall, we're all kind of at a loss in terms of gauging the speed of change. If you asked me a year ago, both my father and I were thinking we'll have major changes in two years. But you ask me today, I don't know. Because it seemed like the scare tactics are still working really well. We don't have the underlying economic pressures on the society that existed in the Arab world. For example Tunisia, the discontent with the government fell on the very poor economic situation. It's like oil into the fire and we have a revolt. In Russia, the country is fairly stable in terms of its economic well-being. Unless we have another crisis in Europe, which we might, as you know. I've read recently that your father's sentence would be reduced and under the new sentence, he could be out next year. I wanted to know your interpretation of that. I've been very happy that my father has not gotten overly excited over that. It could give a lot of hope, but at this point it would be false hope. And that's for a number of reasons. First of all, the sentence was reduced not because the court agreed with the reasoning of the defense team. The appeal to the Supreme Court, which was later handed off to the Moscow City Court for the hearing, dealt with the underlying verdict, and the fact that the charges had been false. The decision of the Moscow City Court does not address that. It reduces the sentence based on the changes in the criminal code, which reduces sentencing for some of the alleged crimes. My father has said himself those are ostrich tactics. Another reason not to get too excited is that the prosecutor asked for a reduction in sentence of 3 months less than was ultimately granted by the court, so they have reason to go back with an appeal to the supreme court, as our defense team has, citing an extreme reduction in the sentence. Since it's not a regular appeal, there is no 10-day limit on when it has to be filed so they can go back at any point. So we see it as a pure PR tactic in light of the Sochi Olympics. It will provide a very positive background. Russia's going to be hosting the Olympics, [Platon] Lebedev is going to be let out in a couple of months, Khodorkovsky is going to be let out at the end of the year. Everything is great, Russia's back on the right back track, let's celebrate. The Olympics are done the 23rd of February, everybody leaves and there's no more focus on Russia and there's a new case against my father. Just like that. So I was very worried that my father would get overly hopeful but he has retained his calm. So he knows what are the chances here, and they are slim. Was there anything else you wanted to touch upon? Well primarily the Magnitsky list. We have the next couple months to determine how this is going to be effective. This is just the first round. This is when the State Department will have to present a list. The way that the law is written, 5 committees on the House side and 5 committees on the Senate side, the chairman and the ranking member can submit additional candidates for the consideration of NSC and then the State Department. And that can happen in mid-April — that's the first list. Obviously this is a huge win for the human rights community in Russia, because there is absolutely no way to get justice back home. --- Thank you to Pavel for taking the time to talk to us.

FA Insights is a daily newsletter from Business Insider that delivers the top news and commentary for financial advisors. Advisors Continue To Be Bullish On Apple (The Wall Street Journal) Investors have been spooked by Apple's recent performance, but advisors are telling their clients that it still makes sense as a long-term holding in a well-diversified portfolio.Â  Some like Lee Munson, owner of Portfolio LLC told the WSJ, "Now is where you're shaking out a lot of the retail investors and hedge fund managers that really are just using that money to go buy other things and aren't really interested in the company itself. ...Over the next few days, if we continue to see a lot of selling, it might be a buying opportunity." Others like Joseph Doyle an advisor at Morris Capital Advisors said he told clients he had limited their exposure by cutting their Apple stake in halfÂ back in September and that they believe "it remains a good long-term investment".  The Evidence Against Actively Managed Investment Funds Is Staggering (Investopedia) There is increasing evidence that hedge funds, mutual funds and private equity don't provide value for their investors.Â  Latest data shows that 70 percent of private equity profits go to managers instead of investors. There are 10 key reasons not to invest in managed funds. Some of these include underperformance, hidden costs, and size bias - "institutions often get too big to invest meaningfully in smaller companies which much research has shown offer the best opportunity for outperformance", to name a few. The 1994 Moment That's Keep More And More Bond Traders Awake At Night (Business Insider) In 1994, the U.S. economy was emerging from a recession and Treasury yields began to rise from their 1993 lows despite the absence of any signs of inflation. Just then the Fed decided to tighten monetary policy causing Treasuries to plunge and interest rates to surge higher.Â  After some surprisingly hawkish sentiment was revealed in the minutes of the December FOMC meeting, some are wondering if we are likely to see a repeat of 1994. Bloomberg, Business Insider Â  5 Lessons To Invest By (Marketwatch) Investors should have a plan and find a process that works for them to follow through according to Chuck Jaffe at MarketWatch. He says finding this process involves 5 crucial steps. 1) "Value long-term effectiveness over short-term results" 2) Be rigorous and disciplined 3) Be honest about how much risk you can take 4) Really commit to a system 5) Diversify. Don't Fear Sequestration, The Stock Market Wants Big Spending Cuts (Deutsche Bank) Deutsche Bank's David Bianco has raised his year-end S&amp;P 500 target to 1,600, from 1,575. "We are encouraged by recent legislation to sever the issue of spending cuts from the debt ceiling," he writes in a note to clients. "A higher debt ceiling side-lines the tail risk of default on debt or entitlement payments and puts the focus on a new spending cut agreement or following through with sequestration. "Donâ€™t fear sequestration, significant spending cuts are desired for stocks. ...Another can-kick invites new risks, whereas sequestration will prevent US credit rating downgrades and keep the Fed accommodative."
He's the largest investor in JCPenney and he has fully supported CEO Ron Johnson throughout an extremely turbulent year. Ackman noted that Johnson has done some "incredible things" so far at JCPenney. The vision he came up with is a big one and it appears to be working thus far. "What Ron is doing here is something that is almost never been done before, certainly in the context of a public company," said Ackman. But there's one big problem with it right now. "The problem with the vision is it's a small percentage of the store, which is the so-called 'shop' strategy," said Ackman. "It's 10-11 percent of the square footage." Sales in the shops have been strong thus far. IZOD, for instance, recently said that its new shops in JCPenney stores are a "home run." That other giant chunk of the store, though, is killing JCPenney. "The negative is 90 percent of the store," said Ackman. "Very very difficult year. Sales results reported so far — mid 20s down comps. Those are numbers that no retailer likes to see." So, what would it take for Ackman to determine that Johnson actually wasn't the right person for the job? "If three years from now, Ron Johnson is still struggling to turn around JCPenney, then he's probably the wrong guy," said Ackman. He elaborated when pressed by CNBC host Scott Wapner. Will an activist investor like Ackman actually wait three full years to see of Johnson's ideas will work? "The answer here is: JCPenney's going to make progress," said Ackman. "I expect it will and Ron expects it will as well. Again, no company survives down 25 percent comps over 3 years that's not happening. Ron is going to work to solve the problem." "And I wouldn't project the future based on the last 12 months. That would be the advice I would give." Here's the video — from CNBC: 
Activist investor Bill Ackman and billionaire investor Carl Icahn just squared off in the best moment in financial television on CNBC's "Half Time Report". The epic feud between these two titans goes back a decade, to when Ackman was running his former hedge fund Gotham Partners. Â In short, they did a deal together and it ended up going to court with Ackman winning. Today, Icahn, who was dropping curse words left and right on live TV, was full of insults for Ackman. He even had a few for host Scott Wapner, who was basically a referee today.Â  We noticed that Ackman held his composure during the segment. Â He didn't throw around curse words or mean insults. Â He mostly just called Icahn dishonest. Anyway, here's a round up of some of the little gems that came from Icahn's mouth today. ON WHEN ACKMAN CALLED HIM IN 2003: ON ACKMAN AS A FRIEND: Â  ON HAVING DINNER WITH ACKMAN:Â Â  ON ACKMAN DONATING ANY HLF PROFITS TO CHARITY:Â  ON ACKMAN SAYING ICAHN IS A GOOD INVESTOR:Â  **BONUS:Â ON WHEN SCOTT WAPNER ASKED HIM IF HE'S LONG HLF:Â  Â It was entertaining to say the least.Â  For the full roundup, see here &gt; SEE: The 16 Nastiest Financial Feuds &gt;
As an investor who loves to simply buy, hold and collect returns from my investments, I usually hate the idea of having to sell one of the stocks in my portfolio. After all, I'd like to think that I invested in good companies that didn't ever need to be sold. But sometimes even stocks that have delivered years of solid returns lose their stride. Other times a good company may become mediocre. And then there are times when you discover you chose a bomb of a stock instead of a treasure. Meanwhile, dozens of other potentially great stocks await that could make your money grow much faster — so why not just dump the stock that's not performing?  Because selling for the wrong reasons can be a costly mistake. It's much easier to buy a stock than to know when you should sell one. Many investors are reactive and sell at the same time everyone else does — when they're fearful. But your emotions aren't the best guide for making critical financial decisions. Look at how investors have reacted to stock market downturns in the past five years:  As you can see, investors often react and sell after it's too late. Other times they hold on and keep losing money on a soured stock. That's why it's important to be proactive, watching the finances and moves of the company behind the stock you own so you can see the warning signs before your stock falls (or in some cases, plunges further than it has already). While it's generally a good idea for most investors to sell sparingly, here are some emotion-free signs that say it's finally time to sell a stock: Warning Sign #1: Your stock has a shockingly high price-to-earnings ratio (P/E). While you may have enjoyed healthy gains from a stock that you've held onto for years, keep an eye on its price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), which essentially compares the company's most recent earnings to its stock price. Just as a relatively low P/E can signal that a stock is a bargain, a relatively high P/E can indicate that a stock is overpriced and ready for a plunge. Case in point: From 1990 to the end of 1999, Microsoft's stock skyrocketed over 15,600%. However, its P/E showed the stock had climbed well into overpriced territory, trading at a price that was 84 times what it was earning per share. Once investors realized that the stock was overvalued, many dumped the stock and MSFT shares lost nearly two-thirds (63%) of their value over the year 2000. Stay alert: While a high P/E doesn't always mean a stock is overvalued (growth stocks sometimes have much higher P/E ratios), you may want to investigate further if your stock has a P/E that is significantly higher than its industry peers' or the overall market's P/E (historically it's been between 14 and 17). You can compare a company's P/E with its peers' using the financial data website Morningstar.com — here's how Microsoft compares today. [For more ways to see if a company is overvalued, read The #1 Rule Every Stock Investor Needs to Know.] Warning Sign #2: The company's competitive advantage is in danger. Whether it's through a superior product, brand power, low prices, patents or technology, a company's competitive advantage is the wall that keeps competitors from taking away market share and profits. But if competitors find a better way, a company's competitive advantage can disappear quickly, and the stock's future growth could be in jeopardy. For example, movie-rental company Blockbuster used to beat competitors with convenience — by having more stores, more available movies and flexible return policies. But when competitors like Netflix offered mail-order DVD service and movies to stream online from home, Blockbuster's competitive advantage completely disappeared, the stock became worthless and the company filed for bankruptcy — all between 2002 and 2010. Stay alert: Study the latest headlines about your stock and look for broad changes in industry trends. Are competitors providing a better service or offering a better price? Are consumer tastes changing, and is the company you are invested in adapting to these changes better than its competitors? Is the industry as a whole growing or shrinking? No one can predict exactly what will happen as industries change, but your stock should represent a company that has a clear edge over competitors in a healthy industry — otherwise, be prepared to sell. Warning Sign #3: The company makes drastic changes in its direction or leadership. You may have originally bought a stock because you felt the company had a winning business model and good management that would give you healthy returns over time. But then the company suddenly changes — perhaps it loses its visionary leader that carried it to success (like Apple's Steve Jobs) or maybe the company changes its business model or vision. Dramatic changes like these can dramatically alter a company's future performance. Stay alert: Change is inevitable in almost every company, but if the business loses the leaders or business model that you felt made it successful in the first place, it's time to re-evaluate. Do you feel the company will continue to be successful? Research the new leaders and changes, follow your instincts and consider dumping the stock if you feel uncertain of the company's future. [InvestingAnswers Feature: How An Executive Departure Can Be Bad (or Good) For Your Stock's Value] Warning Sign #4: The company's sales are stalling or falling. While a tough economy can make it difficult for companies to keep sales growing every year, a trend of falling revenue may signal that the company has trouble marketing or selling its products and services or finding new sources of income. Stay alert: Watch the company's annual income statement; its top line should have been steady or growing over the past few years. If revenues are trending downward, especially in an industry where competitors have experienced sales growth over the same period, it may be time to sell if you don't think good times are ahead for the company. Warning Sign #5: The company's profit margins (and earnings) are shrinking. Profit margin is simply the percentage of revenue a company takes in as profit (after expenses, taxes and interest have been paid). A trend of shrinking annual profit margins signals that the company's expenses are rising faster than its revenues — meaning a company is having trouble keeping costs under control and keeping profits up. Stay alert: As with revenues, look at the company's past annual income statements to see if profit margins have been holding steady and that net income (profit) has been growing over the past few years. If competitors have been able to keep their profit margins and net income growing while your company's earnings have stalled or declined, be prepared to hit the sell button. Warning Sign #6: The company recently cut its dividend payment. Management will almost always put a positive spin on things to make the company's future look rosy to analysts. But a company's actions will speak louder than words. While a mature company raising its quarterly dividend payment can signal optimism about its future and can reward its shareholders with a larger dividend, a company slashing its dividend payment often is expecting lower earnings and less growth in the future. Stay alert: If a company (assuming it pays a dividend at all) announces that it will reduce the size of its dividend payments to its shareholders, understand why the decision was made. Some companies slash their dividend payment to free up cash for research and development or expansion purposes, which is fine if you believe it's a good move (see #3 for help on that). But other times, that's not the case. If you don't want to stick around and weather the storm of weak future earnings, a dividend cut announcement may be yet another indicator that it's time to exit. [InvestingAnswers Feature: How To Recognize When A Dividend Cut Is Coming] The Investing Answer: Knowing when to sell a stock is extremely difficult even for professional investors, so look for more than one or two warning signs before you pull out. The stocks that are really worth selling likely will carry more than a few of these trouble signs, which will make your decision easier. If the stock that you hold represents a company in decline or in a declining industry, if the reasons you bought the stock in the first place have changed considerably, if the stock is overvalued or if the stock suffers from all of the above, it may be time to cash in the chips. On the bright side, you'll have more cash free to make your next great investment.
Just posted by CNBC, the full Bill Ackman vs. Carl Icahn brawl. Our full writeup of the event is here. 
Legendary investor Carl Icahn has made his way into the battle over Herbalife. So it's time to remember that this isn't the first time he's gone head to head with Bill Ackman. Last time, though, he lost. This time, who knows? When Ackman presented his dizzying takedown of Herbalife, a nutritional multi-level marketing company, last month, the Street was relatively quiet watching the stock through the holiday season. Perhaps everyone was waiting for Herbalife to present it's side of the story today. But even if they weren't, the quiet period may very well end now that Icahn's in the game. The feud between Ackman and Icahn only ended in 2011 and dates back to 2004. One of the weirdest things about it? It was all over only $4.5 million. In 2003 Bill Ackman's first hedge fund, Gotham Partners, had just blown up and he was being investigated by then-Attorney General Eliot Spitzer. The investigation was eventually dropped, but this definitely wasn't the best time in Ackman's career. He needed to do a deal. Specifically, he wanted to sell Hallwood Realty, a company whose stock was trading about $60 a share but Ackman believed it was worth $140. So he called Icahn. From the NYT: â€œBy reputation, I knew he was a tough guy and a difficult guy,â€ Mr. Ackman says. â€œI wanted to make sure I could collect.â€He continues: â€œI insisted the agreement be short. I also insisted it have a mathematical example in it, so that there could be no question about the intent of the agreement.â€ Thatâ€™s not quite the way Mr. Icahn remembers it. He says that he was the one who was worried, and that Mr. Ackman was under investigation and desperate to sell. (Both investigations were later dropped.) â€œI checked him out,â€ Mr. Icahn says. â€œHe was in trouble with the S.E.C.; he had investors leaving him. A few of my friends called me up and said; â€˜Donâ€™t deal with this guy.â€™ â€ Regardless, the two made a deal. Icahn bought shares of the company from Ackman for $80 a share with the promise that if he sold the shares and made a profit above 10% within the next three years they would split it. To make sure everything was on the up and up, Ackman included some legal provisions in his contract with Icahn. First the contract stipulated that if there was any legal trouble, the loser would pay the winner's legal fees. Second it said that if payment was delayed, Icahn would owe Ackman a lot of interest. In 2004, Hallwood merged with another company, for $137 a share. That meant Icahn made some good money on the deal, so Ackman called him for Gotham Partners' cut. More from NYT: As Mr. Ackman tells it, the older man scoffed: â€œFirst off, I didnâ€™t sell,â€ Mr. Icahn told him. Mr. Icahn argued that a merger did not constitute a sale of shares. â€œWell, do you still own the shares?â€ Mr. Ackman asked. â€œNo,â€ Mr. Icahn said. â€œBut I didnâ€™t sell.â€ And so it went. Mr. Ackman threatened to sue. Mr. Icahn roared that he would counter sue. â€œGo ahead, sue me. You know what, Iâ€™m going to sue you!â€ Mr. Icahn shouted, according to Mr. Ackman, who says Mr. Icahn told him that he took his advice on MBIA and lost $20 million. So Ackman eventually sued, and while the men barely spoke (their lawyers did all the talking) there was some name calling (from the NYT): â€œThe guy is a shakedown artist,â€ Mr. Ackman sneers. â€œHis word is worthless.â€ Mr. Icahn says: â€œHeâ€™s now the young gunfighter who wants to show he beat the older gunfighter with a big reputation. He just likes pounding himself on the chest.â€ And there was an incident when the two men reportedly got into an argument at a restaurant when Icahn offered to settle the dispute by giving $10 million to the charity of Ackman's choice. Ackman said the money belonged to Gotham Partners and refused. Then there was the time investor David Tisch asked Ackman about Icahn. Icahn wanted to invest in one of Tisch's funds and Ackman told him to think better of taking Icahn's money. According to the NYT, though, Tisch and Icahn don't remember ever hammering out a formal offer for investment. Meanwhile in Court, Icahn and Ackman's lawyers went to war for 7 years. Finally in October 2011, Icahn's final appeal was denied and Ackman was awarded $9 million. However, to this day it's well known that Ackman and Icahn dislike each other. Even the New York Times Dining section has mentioned it. In a September 2012 piece about how NYC restaurant staffs accommodate their most loyal patients, this little gem appeared: At Marea, Michael Whiteâ€™s Italian restaurant on Central Park South, for instance, the hedge fund manager William A. Ackman is a regular and one of many customers who rates an NR, never refuse. What the computer does not say (but the general manager, Rocky Cirino, knows) is that servers can never seat Mr. Ackman next to Carl C. Icahn, another big Wall Street name. The two have sued each other. Now it looks like Herbalife is the next battlefield for these two. Buckle up.
Bloomberg via YouTubeDeutsche Bank's David Bianco just cranked up his year-end target for the S&amp;P 500 to 1,600 from 1,575. "We are encouraged by recent legislation to sever the issue of spending cuts from the debt ceiling," writes Bianco in his latest note to clients. "A higher debt ceiling side-lines the tail risk of default on debt or entitlement payments and puts the focus on a new spending cut agreement or following through with sequestration." And despite the major cuts that would come with sequestration, Bianco thinks those cuts would be better than the alternative. "Don’t fear sequestration, significant spending cuts are desired for stocks," he wrote.  "Another can-kick invites new risks, whereas sequestration will prevent US credit rating downgrades and keep the Fed accommodative." It's interesting to note that Bianco believes a "can kick" would generate higher earnings this year.  But sequestration would be better for stocks: Deutsche Bank More of Bianco's commentary: The best negotiated outcome trims the $70b sequestration for 2013 to ~$50b but maintains $1.2t in cuts over 9 years and opens more of the budget to cuts. Full sequestration would pressure defense and some healthcare company profits, but our 2013E EPS of $108 should be able to withstand it given good 4Q results. Plus PE should expand on lower deficit. We see the main threat to stocks as being the failure to put through spending cuts by either repealing or again delaying sequestration which triggers a rating downgrade and causes bond yields to rise. This could cause the S&amp;P 500 to dip 5-10% to 1350-1425. Downside could be greater if long-term yields surge and threaten credit markets and the housing recovery. Likely S&amp;P target 1525 (1400 if long-term yields jump). The next SEE ALSO: WALL STREET: Here's What The S&amp;P 500 Will Do This Year &gt;

CNBC screengrabActivist investor Bill Ackman, the founder of $12 billion Pershing Square Capital Management, and billionaire investor Carl Icahn brawled moments ago on CNBC's "Halftime Report" hosted by Scott Wapner. It was one of the greatest moments in financial television with two hedge fund titans, who have been feuding for a decade, going head-to-head. Watch the full video here &gt; The segment was originally set up for Ackman to give his response after IcahnÂ blasted himÂ yesterday on Bloomberg TV.Â  Yesterday, Icahn, who has publicly said before that he doesn't like Ackman and has "no respect" for him, ripped into hisÂ "holier than thou" short on Herbalife in an interview with Trish Regan.Â Icahn also called Ackman "disingenuous" and said he's not shorting Herbalife "for the good of humanity."Â  Ackman then fired back yesterday evening in aÂ press releaseÂ saying Icahn is a good investor, but he doesn't keep his word. Â  So Ackman joined CNBC today to respond to his long time rival. Earlier in the CNBC segment, Ackman told Wapner that he finds it interesting that Icahn thinks it's a bad thing that he gave a short thesis at an Ira Sohn event when Icahn also gave a short thesis in 2002 and 2003 at a Sohn Conference, too.Â  Ackman's Pershing Square is shorting more than 20 million shares of Herbalife â€” a multi-level marketing firm that sells nutrition products. Â Ackman said at a Sohn Conference event last month that he thinks the company is a pyramid scheme and has a price target of zero.Â  Minutes into the segment, Icahn called in after the first commercial break to respond to Ackman on live TV. Â It couldn't get any better! He responded after Ackman basically called him a hypocrite. "Listen. Â You know, I've really sort of had it with this guy Ackman, you know," Icahn told CNBC. Icahn then started going over some history of a deal from back in 2003 over Hallwood Realty when Ackman ran Gotham Partners, which was being hit with redemptions and investigated by the SEC at the time over MBIA. (Ackman was never charged with any wrongdoing.) If you're not familiar with the story, Ackman called Icahn and asked him to buy shares of Hallwood Realty, a real estate company trading for about $60, but Ackman said was worth $140. Hallwood merged with another company for $137 a share, Icahn wouldn't give Ackman a cut. A lawsuit followed andÂ Ackman won and Icahn paid him $9 million Ackman's investors were owed.Â  "I'm telling you he's like a crybaby in the schoolyard. Â I went to a tough school in Queens you know and they used to beat up the little Jewish boys. Â He was like one of the little Jewish boys crying that the world is taking advantage of him..." Icahn said when Ackman called him up in 2003, adding "You rue the day I ever met the guy." He then started going over how Ackman's old firm Gotham Partners was being investigated by Eliot Spitzer and the SEC at the time and how he didn't realize that. Icahn said this deal they did "cost him money." Â Ackman ultimately won in court. Â What's more is Ackman was never charged with any wrong doing on that SEC investigation over MBIA. "He's the quintessential example of if you want a friend on Wall Street, get a dog," Icahn later said. Wapner then let Ackman come into the conversation talking about his MBIA short. Â MBIAÂ alleged there was a "conspiracy to drive down its stock price." Â Ackman, who said MBIA didn't deserve a triple-A rating, ended up being right when the credit crisis hit. There were a lot of insults flying during the segment. Â Ackman said that he wanted to defend his reputation. Â He also said it's not a "great use of CNBC air time."Â  Then, it went back to Icahn and Wapner asked if he's long or not. Icahn said he didn't come onto CNBC to be "bullied" after asked him that. "No one's bullying you, Carl," Wapner responded. "Listen to me... I want to say what I want to say and I'm not going to talk about my Herbalife position because you want to bully me...I don't give a damn about what you want to know.Â I want to talk about what I want to talk about...You can say what the hell you want. Â I'm going to talk about what Ackman just said about me, not about Herbalife... I'll talk about Herbalife when I goddamn want to...I'm never going on a show with you again, that's for damn sure, OK."Â Icahn shot back. Throughout the segment, Icahn dropped some g-d bombs and "bullshit" and you could hear the floor traders at the NYSE reacting saying "Ooohhh!" Â  He then proceeded to slam Ackman. Â "As far as I'm concerned, he wanted to have dinner with me. Â I couldn't figure out if he was the most sanctimoniousÂ guy I met in my life or just arrogant and that's Ackman," Icahn said. Â  Wapner, who was basically a referee, tried to ask Icahn if he was long Herbalife. "Let me finish what the hell I want to say," Icahn snapped at Wapner. "You let Ackman talk."Â  "I will tell you one day I think HLF will be the mother of all short squeezes," Icahn said claiming Ackman used the short to boost his return.Â  "He talks about charity. Â That's complete bullshit!" Icahn said.Â  Wapner gently reminded him that we're on live television. Â "That was an interesting choice of words," Wapner said.Â Again, you could hear NYSE floor traders say "Ohhhh!." Ackman then jumped in. "The big issue about Carl Icahn, is he's not used to someone stepping up to him," Ackman said, "Especially like me in 2003."Â  Wapner asked Icahn again if he's long Herbalife and what the motives are behind it. Icahn said "bullshit" again and accused Wapner of "bullying" him. Â Again, the NYSE traders reacted screaming "Ohhh!" Â  The conversation turned back to the Herbalife short. "If there's ever a short squeeze, what the hell does he do?" Icahn asks. Â "Ask him!" Ackman said, "Carl is free to make a tender offer for the company." "Hey, hey you don't have to tell me what I'm free to do," Icahn shot back. "What I thank Carl for is he helped highlight issues with Herbalife," Ackman said accusing him of buying the stock and selling it. The attacks continued, though. "I appreciate you calling me a great investor, but unfortunately I cannot say the same," Icahn said.Â  "Bill, I appreciate you coming on. Carl, I hope you will come back," Wapner said. Before Icahn called in... Ackman says that Herbalife has done harm to millions of people and it deserves scrutiny. Â  He says the press wrote some "fun pieces" on Bill Ackman v. Dan Loeb or Bill Ackman v. Carl Icahn. Â He says the goal is to shed the truth about the company and get the press dig into it.Â  He's talking about short selling in the market. Â He notes that it's unfortunate that they've lost some money so far.Â  He says shorts play an important role in the market. Â  CNBC's Scott Wapner asked if Ackman is friends with Daniel Loeb of Third Point. Â  Loeb took an 8.24% stake (8.9 million shares) on the long side after Ackman's short calling Ackman's accusations "preposterous."Â  Ackman said they've both been in the business a long time.Â  "If he [Dan Loeb] stays long Herbalife, he will lose his entire investment," he said later in the interview. Loeb is also reportedly short Nu Skin. Â Ackman says he doesn't understand why he would be short Nu Skin when he's long Herbalife. Â Â  Ackman says that he doesn't need to be "loved by everyone."Â  He's also calling about Bob Chapman of Chapman Capital who he said came out and said he had a large position. Â Ackman says that Chapman Capital has less than a $100 million AUM. On His JCPenney Stake...Â  Ackman, who is the largest shareholder of JCPenney, is talking about that investment. Â He has taken a bath on the stock so far. He's says CEO Ron Johnson has done some "incredible things," though.Â  He said if Johnson can't turn it around in three years, then he's not the right guy.Â  He does, however, expect the retailer to make progress.Â  "Ron is going to work to solve the problems," he said. "I have enormous confidence in him...He's brilliant."Â  SEE ALSO: The Greatest Hedge Fund Brawl In Ages Is Happening Right Now â€” Here's What You Need To Know &gt;

Pershing Square Capital ManagementBill AckmanIt's all out being put out there now. The feud between hedge fund managers Bill Ackman and Carl Icahn reached a fevered pitch  yesterday, when Carl Icahn told Bloomberg TV's Trish Regan that Ackman was "disingenuous" in his short against multi-level marketing firm, Herbalife. Last night, Ackman responded simply by detailing the root of he and Icahn's animosity, a 2003 deal over Hallwood Realty. At the time, Ackman's hedge fund, Gotham Partners, was going bust. He needed to do a deal so he called up Carl Icahn and offered to sell him shares of Hallwood for $80 a share. It was trading at $60, but Ackman thought it was worth $140. The deal was, if Icahn sold the shares within 3 years and made a profit of 10% or more, he and Ackman would split the proceeds. To ensure that the deal went off without a hitch, Ackman and Icahn signed a 10 page agreement they called "schmuck insurance." (Read it here) From the contract: “COVERED PROFITS” means 50% of the net amount (after reasonable commissions, legal expenses and regulatory filing fees and expenses) derived by Purchaser and its Affiliates on the sale or other transfer of a Covered Unit in excess of the sum of: (i) $80.00 plus (ii) interest thereon accruing on a daily basis at a rate of 10% per annum (equitably adjusted for splits, stock dividends and similar events). For example: if Purchaser derives net proceeds of $100 on the sale of one Covered Unit that it has held for 18 months, then the “Covered Profit” on that Covered Unit would be $4.00 computed as follows: $80.00 + $12.00 (accrued interest) = $92.00$100.00 - $92.00 = $8.00$8.00 x 50% = $4.00 Ultimately, the two didn't argue about the math. They argued about the meaning of the world "sale." A year after Icahn and Ackman sealed this deal, another company bought Hallwood for $137 a share. Ackman called Icahn for Gotham's money, and Icahn said no arguing that he never sold the shares. Ackman countered that Icahn didn't have the shares anymore and had made money so....It was time to go to Court. In 2011, Icahn lost and had to pay Gotham $9 million plus legal fees: In the event that any Seller Indemnified Person brings a legal action against Purchaser in order to enforce its right to such indemnification, if it is ultimately determined by a final non-appealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction that: (i) such Seller Indemnified Person is so entitled to indemnification, then such Seller Indemnified Person asserting such claim shall also be entitled to recover the reasonable cost and expense of counsel incurred in asserting such claim and bringing such action against Purchaser; or (ii) such Seller Indemnified Person has not prevailed in any such action, then such Seller Indemnified Person shall pay to Purchaser the reasonable cost and expense of counsel incurred by Purchaser and its Affiliates in defending such claim. Ackman admits that after the whole battle was through, Icahn called him to shake hands and be friends. That obviously did not happen. Here's the full contract. Icahn/Ackman agreement by  
YouTube Everyone has been talking about the hedge fund war over Herbalife — a multi-level marketing firm that sells weight loss and nutrition products. One one side we have hedge fund titan Bill Ackman, the founder of Pershing Square Capital Management, who is shorting the stock. After Ackman publicly declared his short, hedge fund heavyweight Daniel Loeb, the founder of Third Point LLC, took out a 8.24% stake in the company on the long side.  Some other fund managers have also gone long Herbalife after disagreeing with Ackman's short case. Ackman's rival Carl Icahn hasn't publicly said if he's long Herbalife or not, but he slammed him on Bloomberg TV for his "holier than thou" short calling him "disingenuous." It's definitely been a real-life clash of the titans. The most important thing you have to realize is that Herbalife itself is just the "McGuffin" in this story. It's a plot device that moves the story along, but in itself means very little. A classic McGuffin was the unidentified glowing item in the briefcase in Pulp Fiction, which Marcellus Wallace was so eager to have returned to him. What was it? Nobody knew or cared. But a fabulous story hinged on it. So, if you're just coming into this story, we've put together a comprehensive guide of everything you need to know about the Herbalife hedge fund war:  We'll keep following this story as it develops.  SEE ALSO: The contract that started a huge feud between Bill Ackman and Carl Icahn &gt;
The freshman Democratic Senator from Massachusetts and former Harvard law professor went to Washington as a reformer. And she promised that her first task as Senator would be to take the lead on changing Congress' filibuster rules. Check out this letter she wrote about it back in November (via HuffPo): Remember Jimmy Stewart's classic film Mr. Smith Goes to Washington? I love that movie. That's what most of us think of when we hear the word "filibuster" -- a single passionate senator speaking for hours about legislation they fiercely oppose until they literally collapse with exhaustion. But that's not what today's filibuster looks like. In reality, any senator can make a phone call, say they object to a bill, then head out for the night. In the meantime, business comes to a screeching halt. Senate Republicans have used this type of filibuster 380 times since the Democrats took over the majority in 2006. We've seen filibusters to block judicial nominations, jobs bills, political transparency, ending Big Oil subsidies -- you name it, there's been a filibuster. We've seen filibusters of bills and nominations that ultimately passed with 90 or more votes. Why filibuster something that has that kind of support? Just to slow down the process and keep the Senate from working. This week, Warren had her chance to change the filibuster process so that anyone using it would have to speak for hours and hours instead of just threatening to do so. It didn't quite work (from the AP): U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren says she's disappointed Senate leaders weren't able to come up with tougher changes to the filibuster rule that allows minority parties to bottle up legislation... Warren said in a statement Thursday that she's disappointed the changes aren't more extensive, but added that "some change is better than no change at all." What actually happened, according to WaPo, was that the Senate cut the filibuster vote before a bill's "motion to proceed" when Congress begins considering the legislation. On to the next one, Liz.
YouTube via MercuryOneMemphisMary Jo White, President Obama's nominee to lead the SEC, has a been involved with a plethora of high-profile legal cases. She's locked up infamous terrorists, prosecuted and defended white-collar criminals, and run politically-sensitive investigations. We've delved into her legal history to present the ten highest-profile cases that Mary Jo White has ever been involved with, both as a prosecutor and a criminal defense attorney. A caveat: White didn't actually 'litigate' many of these cases. As her former colleague Patrick Cotter notes, "U.S. Attorneys are the Generals of the army; they’re not the combat soldiers." But by all accounts, White has an incredibly keen and strategic legal mind, and was quite hands-on in cases that she oversaw – one of the reasons she was the President's top choice to run the SEC.
David McNew/Getty ImagesDecember new home sales data was just released and missed expectations falling 7.3 percent month-over-month. The most concerning detail about the report however was inventory at the end of December. "The seasonally adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of December was 151,000. This represents a supply of 4.9 months at the current sales rate," according to the latest report from the U.S. Census Bureau. Basically, that means that the length of time it would take to sell the existing supply of homes climbed to 4.9 months. This is up from November, and down from a year ago. Millan Mulraine at TD Securities: "The drop in sales bring the months' supply of sales to 4.9 months - its highest level since April. And with the supply of new homes on the market increasing for the fourth consecutive months in December, the level of inventory now stands at a  one-year high of 151K units. While this is still close to  multi-decades low, it must be seen in the context of demand, which is yet to move much beyond current cycle lows. The worry, though, is that with the pace of new residential building activity now approaching 1 million units, the impending surge in new homes supply could create a problem for this segment of the housing market, unless there is a commensurate increase in demand.  For now, prices continue to head high, with both mean and median home prices higher in December. On an annual basis, the median price is up 13.9% y/y, while average prices are up at a robust 15.6% y/y pace." What's more, analysts warn that inventory tends to decline at the end of the year, only to pick up again in the first quarter. Home prices have been on the mend because of a decline in inventory.  But a build up of new or distressed inventory could again impact prices. We will be following this story as it develops.
AMID the brouhaha over Germany's gold reserves at the Bundesbank, there's another central bank using gold actively to bolster its currency and financial stability.The strategy looks the same – sitting on big stockpiles of the stuff. But the aim differs, because gold is much closer to the everyday financial system. The tactics differ too. Because the central bank hasn't bought and paid for this gold. Private citizens have."Gold-based deposit accounts [in Turkey] surged 15% this year through the end of July," explained BusinessWeek back in October, "three times the increase in standard savings accounts.""Although much criticised for its use of 'unconventional measures'," the Financial Times added in December, "few would argue that the decision last year by Turkey's central bank to allow the country’s banks to buy gold was anything less than a roaring success."Buying gold isn't quite right. Starting in October 2011, the central bank began allowing commercial banks to hold a portion of their "required reserves" – needed to reassure depositors and other creditors they had plenty of money to hand – in physical gold bullion. Starting at 10%, that proportion was then raised to 30%.Private citizens were similarly encouraged to hold their gold on deposit with their banks. That gold was thus transferred to the central bank's balancesheet. Et voila! Privately-owned gold now backed the nation's finances. A smart idea, which has coincided with Turkey's currency rising, interest rates falling, huge current-account shrinking, and government bonds regaining "investment grade" status.Publicly targeting some of Turkey's estimated 2,200 tonnes of "under-the-pillow" gold, currently worth some $119 billion, the CBRT's governor Erdem Basci has meantime been awarded The Banker magazine's prestigious "Central Banker of the Year 2012" award. But with everything going so swimmingly, might Turkey risk over-heating?Well, the CBRT this week cut its key interest rates – and raised the amount of gold which commercial banks choosing to use bullion as required reserves must hold with it. That fine-tuning is a bid to a) deter foreign investors from buying Lira and so pushing it Lira too high, too fast, and b) prevent those inflows boosting the pace of domestic credit growth by giving the banks too much money to play with.See, with Turkey's mess of the early 2000s now fading from memory (it knocked 6 zeroes off the Lira in 2005), the currency recently neared 12-month highs against both the US Dollar and the Euro. "Amid accelerating capital inflows" from foreign investors, said the central bank in Tuesday's policy statement, "recent credit growth has been faster than envisaged."In order to contain the risks on financial stability, the proper policy would be to keep interest rates at low levels while continuing...to implement a measured tightening [of credit] through reserve requirements." Reporting from Istanbul, Reuters notes that the CBRT raised its "reserve option coefficients" for Gold Bullion and non-Lira currencies. In other words, it forced commercial lenders who choose to hold a proportion of their cash reserves in gold or foreign exchange to deposit more with the central bank."The measures will transfer as much as $2.9 billion in foreign exchange and gold from lenders to the central bank's reserves," says Bloomberg, "as well as withdrawing 300 million Liras from local-currency markets."Analysts at Goldman Sachs had forecast this move last week, noting after comments from Turkish central bank governor Basci – and also noting last month's rise of 2% in the Lira's exchange rate to the Dollar – that CBRT "has shifted focus towards the financial stability risks posed by accelerating capital inflows." Using interest rates and other tools, it would "lean against these inflows and their subsequent FX appreciation pressures," said Goldman's analysts. The CBTR this week cut its annualized rate for overnight loans to 8.75%. That compares with the 12% charged 12 months ago, when inflation ran to double-digits and the Lira was still struggling to find its floor, says the Wall Street Journal's Emerging Europe blog.Can you imagine such a policy, let alone such a turnaround. Of course, not all of Turkey's gold policy can be fully guessed by analysts outside, and there are still plenty of risks to Turkey's growth and stability too. Not least its current account deficit...perhaps the 7th worst in 2012 at $59 billion (IMF forecast).Still, that was down from second place – behind the ever-winning United States of course – in 2011. That spot is now taken by the dear old United Kingdom, a nation which all-too famously sold half its national gold reserves at multi-decade lows between 1999 and 2002. A decade later our deficit with the rest of the world yawned above $80 billion last year.The UK could of course play a similar gambit to Turkey. Indeed, Bullion Vault set forth just such a modest proposal to Parliament early last year."Make private gold deposited at the Bank of England free of capital gains tax. This would dramatically increase the financial firepower of the bank at a time when our commercial banks need support, as might our currency very soon."Some hope! And in the absence of a central bank, or government, willing or able to tackle stability on your behalf, UK savers might want to note that gold did for Turkish households back when the Lira collapsed – time and again – on the currency market.Gold price chart, no delay   |   Buy gold online at live pricesAdrian Ash is head of research at BullionVault – the secure, low-cost gold and silver market for private investors online, where you can buy gold and silver vaulted in Zurich on just 0.5% dealing fees.(c) BullionVault 2013Please Note: This article is to inform your thinking, not lead it.

The Oil Analogy An oil product, such as jet fuel, is in some ways analogous to a specialized employee, with skills different from what human employees have.Â Letâ€™s think of an airline. It has human employeesâ€“pilots, copilots, flight attendants, baggage workers, mechanics, and airport check-in personnel. None of these human employees can actually provide the energy to make the jet fly, however. It takes jet fuel to do that. What happens if the price of jet fuel triples?Â Jet fuel is now more that than triple the price (near $3.00 gallon)Â it was in the late 1990s (under $1.00 gallon, at todayâ€™s prices). Gail Tverberg Figure 1. Jet fuel price in December 2012 $. Jet fuel price per gallon isÂ Spot Gulf Coast price from EIA; price adjustment based on CPI-Urban, from US Bureau of Labor Statistics. The high cost of jet fuel is analogous to the jet fuel employeesâ€™ union demanding triple the wages they were paid previously. So what is the airline to do?Â With very high aviation fuel prices, many tourists who might buy airline tickets will be â€œpriced outâ€ of the market for long distance travel. The airline can sellÂ someÂ airline tickets at higher prices, but not as many. One thing airlines can do is to cut the number of flights, taking the least fuel-efficient planes out of service and reducing flights on routes with the most unfilled seats. According to a recentÂ Wall Street Journal article, airlines spend 34% of revenue on fuel. With such a high fuel cost, even with these changes, airline ticket prices will remain high. But perhaps with fewer flights, the airline can make a profit. If an airline cuts its number of flight, this leads to an â€œacross the boardâ€ cut in the goods and services the airline buys. The airline will use less jet fuel (and thus use fewer â€œjet fuel employeesâ€). If it is able to retire quite a few fuel-inefficient jets, â€œjet fuel employeesâ€ will be cut to a greater extent than human employees. It will use fewer human workers, at all levels: pilots, copilots, flight attendants, and ground workers of all types. The airline will reduce its electricity usage because it needs fewer gates in airports for its operations. The airline will also need less gasoline because it will operate fewer baggage-transport vehicles and other ground vehicles. In many ways, the airline is simply shrinking in size to reflect reduced demand for its high-priced services. When this happens in multiple industries, the result looks very much like recession. I described this situation earlier in a post calledÂ How is an oil shortage like a missing cup of flour?. In that post, I said that if oil supplies are short, the situation is not too different from a baker who does not have enough flour to make a full batch of cookies. If he still wants to make cookies, he needs to make a smaller batch, and so needs to cut back on all of the other ingredients as well. Other Changes an Airline Can Make to Fix Profitability Apart from cutting back on the number of flights and retiring inefficient jets in the process, there are other things an airline can do to offset the higher â€œwagesâ€ demanded by the jet fuel employees union. One is to reduce the wages of human workers. For example, wages and pension plans of pilots can be cut back, or hours lengthened. Â Wages of other workers can be frozen or cut back. Another approach is a merger with another airline, so that â€œredundantâ€ employees can be eliminated, and flights can perhaps be cut back further. Of course, these layoffs and cutbacks in wages will add to recessionary impacts, because these workers will have less discretionary income. A third approach to restoring profitability is to automate some of the functions previously handled by human employees. In this case, electricity is used to substitute for human workers. We can think of this automation as substituting new â€œelectrical employeesâ€ (analogous to the â€œjet fuel employeesâ€) for human employees. Relative to the amount of physical work (pushing buttons, moving luggage, etc.) humans can do, humans are far higher paid than either â€œoil employeesâ€ or â€œelectricity employeesâ€. If we assume that theÂ energy of humans is similar to that used by a 100 watt light bulb, at $20,000 a year, humans are paid roughly 1,500 times as much as â€œoil employeesâ€ and 3,500 times as much as â€œelectricityâ€ employees, to do equivalent physical work. So if automation is an option, it almost always saves money. A fourth way an airline can reduce costs is by purchasing lighter, more fuel-efficient jets. Making a transition of this type takes a long time. Boeingâ€™s Dreamliner 787 is an attempt in this direction, with aÂ 20% fuel savings anticipated. Boeing has over 800 jets of this type on order, but the 50 already in use have been grounded until battery problems are resolved.Â Quite a few changes have been madeÂ in the new jet, so there is a possibility of additional problems also needing to be ironed out, before production ramps up as planned. Another Example: Asphalt Asphalt is another product whose consumption has dropped in recent years. Gail Tverberg Figure 2. Trends in US Fuel Consumption by Type, with 1994 = 1.0, based on EIA data. The amount of asphalt produced in 2012 was only about 70% as much as was produced in 1994.Â The reason for the shortfall in asphalt is partly because at current high oil prices, refineries can make more profit by selling high-valued products like gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel than they can make by selling asphalt.Â A recent EIA article titled,Â Hydrocracking is an important source of diesel and jet fuel,Â makes the statement, â€œA refineryâ€™s ability to upgrade low-value products into high-value products and convert high-sulfur material to low-sulfur material with a secondary unit like a hydrocracker plays a key role in determining its economic fate.â€ State budgets are tight for a variety of reasons, including inadequate gasoline taxes to cover the cost of maintaining roads.Â While part of the need for asphalt can be obtained from recycling, many Â governments are finding that todayâ€™s asphalt costs are so high thatÂ concrete roads would be cheaper in the long run.Â Many states have found it necessaryÂ to go back to gravel on some of the smaller roads, because of the high cost of paving today. State and local budgets are likely to be stretched even farther if the US government solves its budget woes by sending programs back to the states, and lets the states work out the funding. What happens when a state decides move some roads from asphalt back to gravel? For one thing, Â jobs lost in the road paving business. Also, the new gravel roads have an uneven surface, providing moreÂ rolling resistance, so automobile and truckÂ mileage is poorer. In addition, roads tend to degrade more quickly, keeping long-term maintenance costs high. If budgets are tight and roads are not maintained, there is a chance gravel roads will become unusable. If local governments continue to use asphalt for paving (or switch to concrete, which has evenÂ higher initial costs, but lasts longer), they find a need to cut back on other types of services they provide, if they are to avoid a tax increase. This leads to services such as library hours being cut. Cutting back on services reduces both wages and energy costs (lighting and heating/cooling costs). The effect is not all that different from what happens in the airline industry: cuts are made that affect both wages and energy usage of many types. Employee wages seem to be especially affected because changes in employee hours can be made more easily than, say, closing a building or running fewer school buses. The More General Problem It is not just airlines and users of asphalt that cut back because of high oil prices. The story plays out in different ways in many industries. Clearly any restaurant is at risk if high oil prices cause consumers to cut back on discretionary purchases, because reducing the frequency of eating out is an easy way of reducing discretionary expenditures. If restaurants have fewer customers, some restaurants will close and are not replaced. This is the restaurant industryâ€™s Â way of â€œmaking a smaller batchâ€. The result is fewer jobs, less oil use, and less use of resources in general. Another type of discretionary purchase that gets cut when oil prices are high is the purchase of a new car. AÂ recent article by the New York TimesÂ says that the recovery of auto sales since the recent recession has been very slow, withÂ chartsÂ for several countries. Reduced car sales is yet another example of making a â€œsmaller batch.â€ The result is fewer jobs, less use of oil, and less use of many other types of resources. A similar story can be told about new home sales. These dropped in the recent recession, and have been slow to recover. The drop-off is frequently attributed to the housing bubble bursting, but rising oil prices played an important role as well. When oil prices increased in the 2004-2005 period, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates, trying to cut oil prices. Instead, the higher interest rates together with lower discretionary income from high oil prices led to lower housing prices, starting in 2006. (See my article from the journal Energy,Â hereÂ orÂ here.) The Economic Implications of High Oil Prices Our economy is all about â€œadding valueâ€. But where does this value added come from? To a significant extent, this value comes from adding external energy of some sort. It is really the â€œenergy employeesâ€ I mentioned earlier that add this value. Human workers are needed as well, but with automation, the number of human workers required tends to decline. The ability of external energy to add value is what causes the link between Â GDP, energy consumption, and oil consumption.Â Oil plays a special role, because it is easily transported, and can be used in many situation where electricity or some other form of energy (such as human energy, wind energy, or natural gas) would not work. If we look at a graph of changes GDP compared to changes in world oil and energy usage, (Figure 3, below), we see that all three tend to rise and fall together. In fact, changes in oil and energy usage appear to slightly precede GDP changes. This is the pattern we would expect, if economics are causing a â€œsmaller batchâ€ to be made when oil prices are high. Part of this change may simply reflect a transfer of energy use from less efficient industries (ones using more high-priced oil in their fuel mix) to more efficient industries (ones using less high-priced oil in their fuel mix). If could also reflect a shift in oil and energy distribution to more less efficient countries (ones using more high-priced oil in their fuel mix) to more efficient countries (ones using less high-priced oil in their fuel mix). For example, Greece (which specializes in vacation tourism, and which uses much oil in its energy mix) would be expected to be an oil/energy loser (Figure 4, below). Figure 4. Greeceâ€™s growth in energy use, oil use, and GDP (three-year averages). Oil and energy use based on BPâ€™s 2012 Statistical Review of World Energy. GDP growth based on USDA Economic Research data. China (which uses much coal in its energy mix and thus keeps costs low, and specializes in inexpensive manufacturing) would be expected to be an oil/energy gainer (Figure 5, below). See my posts,Â Energy Leveraging: An Explanation for Chinaâ€™s Success and the Worldâ€™sÂ UnemploymentÂ andÂ Why Coal Consumption Keeps Rising, for discussion of this issue. Figure 5. Chinaâ€™s growth in energy use, oil use, and GDP (three-year averages). Oil and energy use based on BPâ€™s 2012 Statistical Review of World Energy. GDP growth based on USDA Economic Research data. High prices work together with a number of other factors (including increased automation and increased competition from countries with lower wages) to force wages of humans down, and to reduce the number with jobs. The proportion of US citizens with jobs started declining about the year 2000 and accelerated with the recent recession: Figure 6. US Number Employed / Population, where US Number Employed is Total Non_Farm Workers from Current Employment Statistics of the Bureau of Labor Statistics and Population is US Resident Population from theÂ US Census. 2012 is partial year estimate. If we look at the ratio of wages (broadly defined, including proprietorsâ€™ income and taxes paid on behalf of employees by employers, but not including transfer payments, such as Social Security payments and Unemployment Insurance) to GDP in Figure 7, below, Â we see that the ratio of wages to GDP has been dropping since 2000â€“another indication that human wages are not keeping up with the rest of the economy. Gail Tverberg Figure 7. Wage Base (defined as theÂ sum of â€œWage and Salary Disbursementsâ€ plus â€œEmployer Contributions for Social Insuranceâ€ plus â€œProprietorsâ€™ Incomeâ€ from Table 2.1. Personal Income and its Distribution) as Percentage of GDP, based on US Bureau of Economic Analysis data. *2012 amounts estimated based on part-year data. If â€œEnergy Employeesâ€ Are Really Doing Most of the Work If it is really the â€œenergy employeesâ€ doing most of the work, then the models used by many economists today are not really correct, and some of the standard beliefs based on these model arenâ€™t right either. For example: 1. The idea that the value of oil or other energy to the economy is proportional to its price doesnâ€™t hold.Â This can be seen from the examples provided. In fact, if oil or another needed energy product is removed, very close to no work gets done. Humans can provide a little energy, but compared to the energy of oil or electricity, our efforts are puny, and very high-priced. Without external energy, humansâ€™ efforts are limited to tasks like digging with a stick in the ground, or making baskets with reeds that they have gathered. 2. One type of energy doesnâ€™t necessarily substitute easily for another type of energy.Â Just as one type of employee (mechanic, airline pilot, or flight attendant) canâ€™t necessarily be substituted for another, one type of energy cannot necessarily be substituted for another. Dreamlinerâ€™s battery problems illustrate that even trying to substitute a little more electrical energy for oil energy can provide a technological challenge. 3. Somewhat surprisingly, high oil prices remain a drag on the economy permanently, because the high wages of the â€œoil employeesâ€ remain. Output isnâ€™t any higher with these higher wages, so there is not a proportional benefit to society from these higher oil wages. More human workers may be hired in the oil extraction process (often in another country). But even if more workers are hired in the same country, their output does not replace the entirely different kind of output that is provided by the (now-unaffordable to many) high-priced oil. Another factor in the slow uptake of high oil prices is the fact thatÂ governments can temporarily hide some of the effects of high-priced oilÂ through unemployment benefits and stimulus programs. This temporary cover-up cannot continue for long, though, because governments (such as the US and other oil importers) soon run into problems with high deficits (as is happening now). When governments raise taxes or reduce benefits to solve their financial problems, the deferred high-priced oil problems return, showing that the problem never really left. 4. An economy which is mostly services, is not insulated from the problem of high oil prices.Â Both the airline and asphalt examples illustrateÂ how high oil costs can circulate through the economy and disrupt discretionary spending, even in the US. Â (Also seeÂ Ten Reasons Why High Oil Prices are aÂ Problem.) Services tend to be the â€œfluffâ€ of society because for the most part, because we could live without them, at least temporarily. For now, we have a temporary respite from oil-price impacts because of high deficit spending by governments. If governments are forced to balance their budgets, cutbacks seem likely in many areas of services, including medicine for the elderly, higher education, and government-sponsored research programs. If cutbacks occur in areas such as these, weÂ can expect that GDP will shrink faster than savings in oil and energy useâ€“a reversal of what has happened in the past, and a reversal of what many economists have come to expect in the future. Also, contrary to popular belief, we cannot increase the economy very much by simply selling services that do not require energy to one another. It really takes â€œenergy employeesâ€ to play their role as well. Without external energy, we can dig in each othersâ€™ back yards with sticks, but this activity doesnâ€™t add much to the economy. We need â€œenergy employeesâ€ playing their role as well, if we are to have computers, and metal scissors, and the many other tools we expect, even in a service economy.
Earlier this month, we posted a perfectly blunt cover letter written by an aspiring Wall Street intern that went viral and was referred to as the "best cover letter ever." In the student's email to a boutique investment bank in New York, he reminded the banker that they had met a couple summers ago at Smith &amp; Wollensky in New York.  After that name drop, Smith &amp; Wollensky has taken out an ad in the New York Times offering the student an internship if the bank didn't give him one.

Debt collectors have time and again proven to be ruthless in tracking down delinquent borrowers, so perhaps it was only a matter of time before social media became their go-to hunting grounds.Â  In a report on the government's attempt to tighten laws on collection practices, attorneyÂ Billy HowardÂ tells Bloomberg's Carl Dougherty about his client's run-in with social media loan sharks: "Howard said heâ€™s seen more aggressive use of social media by debt collectors, including rude postings on a personâ€™s â€œwall,â€ the part of a Facebook account that a personâ€™s friends can see. Some collectors masquerade as friendly personalities to catch an alleged debtorâ€™s attention. â€œYou get a friend request from some chick in a bikini,â€ said Howard, a lawyer with Morgan &amp; Morgan P.A. in Tampa, Florida. â€œYou say yes, and then somebody says â€˜â€˜by the way, Iâ€™m a debt collector.â€™"Â  While consumers are protected by abusive collections practices under The Fair Debt Collections Practices Act, the law took effect more than 30 years ago â€“â€“ well before anyone could have dreamed up a world with Facebook stalking.  That's why regulators have been calling for new regulationsÂ that could add social media protections explicitly to the list. Â As of January, most large debt collectors were officially herded under the regulatory umbrella of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.Â  In tangent with the Federal Trade Commission, the CFPB's already issued rules that would force collectors to streamline consumer complaint practices, keep borrowers informed of any legal actions from start to finish, and tone down aggressive language.Â It might also restrict them from contacting borrowers on sites like Facebook,Â GoogleÂ Plus,Â Twitter, andÂ LinkedIn.Â  But chances are that the debt industry won't take kindly to its young new Sheriff. The CFPB estimates as many asÂ 30 million consumers are being pursued by collectors today, accounting for more than $12 billion in revenue per year. It's a lucrative business, and since many forms of debt â€“â€“ including medical bills and student loans â€“â€“ can be sold off multiple times to different collectors, persistent collectors can easily chase borrowersÂ well into their retirement years. "In just a few months I'm going to turn 62 years old," said a former Psychology student in aÂ debt storyÂ posted onÂ studentdebtcrisis.org. "I've been attempting to pay back my [$44,000 in private] student loan debt for 22 years."Â  Word to the wise: If you're being hounded by debt collectors the old fashioned way (by phone) or otherwise, the best way to report aggressive tactics is to either alert the FTC or submit a complaint to the CFPB. And don't forget youÂ have rights, too.Â  SEE ALSO: This former student was nearly ruined by student loan debt &gt;

The "older house sister" is getting massive coverage in Chinese media in a scandal that touches on many problems in contemporary China, including corruption and the household registration system (hukou). The Telegraph summarizes the case in Rural Chinese banker built up £100 million property portfolio: Gong Aiai, 49, who is known in the Chinese blogosphere as "Older House Sister", is said to have parlayed her position as deputy head of a small bank in northwestern China's Shaanxi province into at least three extra identities, one of them identifying her as a Beijing native that allowed her to buy up sought-after property holdings in the capital.

Officers have also been sent to Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces to take part in a joint investigation."We will suspend and detain any police officer involved in (helping) Gong (to register false hukou)," the Beijing Public Security Bureau said in a statement on Thursday. Xinhua writes that Hukou forgery scandals highlight police corruption: A Xinhua reporter found by investigation that a fake hukou can be bought for between 30,000 yuan and 50,000 at a grass-roots police station in a county of northeast China's Jilin Province."What do I need to prepare to get an extra hukou?" the reporter asked, pretending to be interested in buying one."Only a photo is needed, a different one from the one on your current ID card," a policeman replied, adding it took about one month to finish all procedures.In fact, it was found that the new hukou is not even "fake," as all the documents and procedures are exactly the same as those used to get a legitimate one. There must be some very nervous police and officials as it is highly unlikely Gong is the only one to have bought an extra hukou and any serious investigation could reveal a lot of corruption. Given the level of official media coverage heads will need to roll.Beijing has launched a campaign (People's Daily) against waste and official gluttony.

Despite the “generally balanced” tone of the recent UNSC resolution on North Korea, warnings to take “significant action” will only lead to promises “to boost and strengthen defensive military power”.More sanctions will only lead to less dialogue because sticks work only when carrots are also on offer. In the situation where military action is inconceivable and diplomacy does not work, the usage of soft power might be more useful. Following Obama’s 2008 arrival at the White House North Korea conducted a rocket launch similar to the latest one and when similar UN sanctions were applied, quickly followed it with a nuclear test. At a time when Obama had promised an “open hand” to North Korea, Pyongyang’s one-two blow undermined the prospects for any short-term engagement between Washington and Pyongyang.China as usual has urged calm after the DPRK nuclear test announcement (Xinhua): "It is in the common interests of all parties concerned to maintain peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and achieve the denuclearization of the peninsula," spokesman Hong Lei said at a regular news briefing. "(We) hope all concerned parties will keep calm and act in a cautious and prudent way, as well as refrain from taking any action that could lead to the progressive escalation of tensions," the spokesman said. At some point the US has to take nuclear threats from the DPRK seriously, as China surely understands, right?For those interested in reading more about the DPRK, NK News is a terrific source of information on North Korea and also has a daily newsletter.Today's Links:THE ESSENTIAL EIGHTParty Official: Bo Xilai Could Face Severe Punishment - WSJ.com - i've been saying since the chongqing exposes in chinese media last month that the odds Bo gets a ride in the lethal injection van are higher than many assume// "We have always had severe punishment for corrupt officials," Mr. Li [Jingtian] said during the interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday, in response to a question about the fate of Mr. Bo.

And given shift in market, and rise of Samsung, it has far less leverage with China Mobile than it once might have. Basically all my Beijing friends with smartphones are not interested in the iPhone 5, even though many have the 4s. it has been a stunningly rapidly shift in my little world...but that is how fashion works, and a phone in china is fundamentally a fashion accessory, and the iPhone 5 is a relative fashion flop // Apple's best plan of attack remains securing a deal with the country's top mobile carrier by far, China Mobile Ltd. It also needs to push the development of more localized apps and extend installment financing to bring its pricey smartphones within the reach of an urban populace with an average annual income of just $3,500. But it should resist the temptation to just put out a cheaper iPhone, some analysts say. Introducing a long-rumored lower-cost version of the gadget could backfire by diluting Apple's premium brand - one of its most valuable assets. "If you think of Apple, it's like a bright star in the galaxy, shining so brightly and everyone is looking at it. But it might have dimmed a bit as other stars such as Samsung have popped up," said TZ Wong, an analyst at research firm IDC.Lenovo Says RIM Bid Among Options to Boost Mobile Unit - Bloomberg - any possible deal unlikely to be approved, though that will not stop hyperventilating by bankers and RIM bulls// Acquiring RIM would require approval from Canadian and U.S. regulators because of the size of the transaction and the fact that the company operates secure mobile networks for government agencies.

Kerry’s Approach to China as Secretary of State | Center for American Progress - Nina Hachigian | January 24, 2013--Some issues in the U.S.-China relationship need immediate attention. Foremost among them is the dispute between Japan and China over the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands, which is becoming increasingly tense and dangerous. Sen. Kerry and his team would be wise to devote considerable energy to determining how the United States can help diffuse the situation. Beyond the immediate issues, a broader aspect of U.S. policy toward China needs attention: The United States and China have no shared vision for what their future bilateral relationship could or should look like. They have not articulated a clear understanding of how they could continue to co-exist in peace a decade or two down the road, and they need to develop a shared, tangible idea for the future of the relationship.Auditors named in Caterpillar-ERA debacle - FT.com - too bad the partners who own the relationship with the firms that go bad are never named. investors would benefit from an accounting malpractice database// Two of the world’s top accounting firms helped conduct due diligence last year for Caterpillar’s $886m acquisition of ERA, the Chinese mining equipment maker that was later alleged to have accounting irregularities.

Deloitte audited the working capital for ERA, while Ernst &amp; Young conducted overall due diligence, one of these people said.Cleaning Up China's Secret Police Sleuthing - Caixin - Wiretapping, email hacking, cell phone tracking and secret videotaping are just a few of the cloak-and-dagger techniques long employed by police in the course of criminal investigations in China.

Not complete secession, but that’s the first thing that happens. You’ll see anti-Chinese and anti-Japanese across the board. You’ll see some violence.

pegappp / FlickrPaul Krugman has the same read on the latest change in budget discussions as we do. We've noted that A) It was a bombshell that Obama didn't talk more about the deficit in his inaugural speech B) That deficit hawks have lost grip over the discussion. Says Krugman: President Obamaâ€™s second Inaugural Address offered a lot for progressives to like. There was the spirited defense of gay rights; there was the equally spirited defense of the role of government, and, in particular, of the safety net provided by Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. But arguably the most encouraging thing of all was what he didnâ€™t say: He barely mentioned the budget deficit. Mr. Obamaâ€™s clearly deliberate neglect of Washingtonâ€™s favorite obsession was just the latest sign that the self-styled deficit hawks â€” better described as deficit scolds â€” are losing their hold over political discourse. And thatâ€™s a very good thing. He gives four reasons that they've been vanquished: Read Krugman's full column here &gt;

Last month's number was revised up to 398K, for 9.3 percent. December new home sales were up 8.8 percent from a year ago. The median sales prices of new homes sold in December was $248,900. The seasonally adjusted estimate of new houses for sale was 151,000, which represents a supply of 4.9 months at the current sales rate. An estimated 367,000 new homes were sold in 2012, up 19.9 percent from a year ago. Original New home sales for December will be out at 10 a.m. ET. Analysts polled by Bloomberg are looking for sales to rise to an annual rate of 385 K. Click here to refresh &gt; While housing has been called the only bright spot in the U.S. economy, some are concerned that new home sales haven't been as strong and could add to inventory. Millan Mulraine at TD Securities wrote: The new homes market has been a laggard in the overall housing market recovery, and while new homebuilding and existing home sales activity have risen significantly from their lows, new home sales have yet to enjoy a similar turnaround in fortune. Remember decline in inventory (existing and new homes) is one of the key things propping up home prices. Moreover analysts caution about seasonality in interpreting year-end data. "Inventory typically falls at the end of the year and picks up again in Q1 in anticipation of the spring selling season," according to Bank of America's Michelle Meyer. New home sales measure newly constructed homes where sales have closed. Investors watch this data because it offers insight on the health of consumer and the economy.

pixel 8 via FlickrSome roller derby girlsA roller derby girl named Jillian Bellovary (a.k.a. "Big Banger"), who is a regular user of Herbalife, has some harsh words for hedge fund manager Bill Ackman if the company goes under. She wrote the following to NPR's Planet Money: (emphasis ours)  ....Herbalife is pretty big in the roller derby community because they help sponsor a fitness/nutrition challenge (called Derbalife). The Herbalife products are not at all required for the challenge, but of course they are glad to educate us about them if we want to try them out. So, if you are wondering who the Herbalife customers are — a bunch of them are rollergirls. The shakes are great and if the company goes under because of this short-selling nonsense then I am totally going to go knock that guy down. Yipes!  Ackman, who runs $12 billion Pershing Square Capital Management, is shorting more than 20 million shares of Herbalife.  He believes the multi-level marketing company that sells nutrition products is a "pyramid scheme."  Ackman has also pledged to donate 100% of personal profits he makes from the short to charity.  Since December 18, the trading session before Ackman confirmed his short, shares of Herbalife are up more than 1.7%.  The stock touched a 52-week low of $24.24 a share on December 24 and have moved back above the pre-Ackman short level since then.  SEE ALSO: SALESMAN: Here's How Herbalife Got Me A $30 Million Mansion, A Fleet Of Fancy Cars And A Better Body &gt;
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner leaves office today, so it's as good a time as any to reflect on his performance. When Geithner took office, the markets were in free-fall and the Dow Jones briefly dipped below 7000. Under his steady leadership, the DJIA has more than doubled from its 2009 trough. His vigorous defense of the banking system played a big role in ensuring a turnaround. 
Yale professor Robert Shiller was one of a relative handful of stock-market observers who warned that the bull market of the late 1990s was a colossal bubble in the making. Shiller's book, Irrational Exuberance, was published moments before the 2000 top, and it foretold much of the carnage that was to come. Shiller followed up Irrational Exuberance with a book arguing that the housing market was in a similar bubble. He thus became one of the only observers to plant a flag and call both bubbles before they popped. We sat down with Professor Shiller in Davos to discuss the state of both houses and stocks. Shiller's thoughts on houses are here (he thinks the current optimism is premature if not flat-out wrong). His thoughts on stocks are below. * * * Henry Blodget: So, on to stocks. When we had the crash, we finally did get below average on your 10-year smoothed earnings price-earnings ratio, the cyclically adjusted P/E. Professor Shiller: Yes, in 2009. Blodget: We never got as low as weâ€™ve gotten in prior bear markets, and that led a lot of people like me to be stupidly waiting on the sidelines until we got to single-digit P/Es, where it would be â€˜safeâ€™ to buy, and as a result I missed a lot of the rally. As you look at, now weâ€™re above a 20s PE again, and we have been for several years. Do you think itâ€™s possible that something has changed and that the average will now be higher over the next 100 years than it was over the past 100 years, or do you expect that we will go back to the ~15x earnings average? Shiller: Certainly itâ€™s possible, but when you say that it reminds me of Irving Fisherâ€™s 1930 book called something like The Great Crash And After, and in that book, which I think he wrote before the 1929 crash, because no one can write a book in such short order as that â€“ thereâ€™s a chapter on a new level for the P/E ratio. Blodget: Aha! 'This time it's different.' Shiller: And he had a prediction for the next century, that it would be very high. And heâ€™s a very persuasive writer. One thing he talked about was Charles Amos Dice, who wrote a famous book in the mid-20s about common stocks as investments, pointing out that stocks have always outperformed other investments, and that now a new breed of sophisticated investors understand that, and weâ€™ll never revert to such low pricing for stocks again. Dow 36,000 made the same statement. Robert Shiller130 years of the Shiller PE (blue line)Blodget: Exactly. Many people made similar statements to that. So I think a lot of â€“ one frustration a lot of people have with the cyclically adjusted P/E and others is that itâ€™s not particularly helpful for the timing mechanism, do you think itâ€™s good to use as a sort of projected 10-year return, where when P/Es are high the return tends to be low, and vice versa? Shiller: John Campbell, whoâ€™s now a professor at Harvard, and I presented our findings first to the Federal Reserve Board in 1996, and we had a regression, showing how the P/E ratio predicts returns. And we had scatter diagrams, showing 10-year subsequent returns against the CAPE, what we call the cyclically adjusted price earnings ratio. And that had a pretty good fit. So I think the bottom line that we were giving â€“ and maybe we didnâ€™t stress or emphasize it enough â€“ was that itâ€™s continual. Itâ€™s not a timing mechanism, it doesnâ€™t tell you â€“ and I had the same mistake in my mind, to some extent. Wait until it goes all the way down to a P/E of 7, or something. Blodget: Right, perfectly safe, so then you can buy. Shiller: But actually, the lesson there is that if you combine that with a good market diversification algorithm, the important thing is that you never get completely in or completely out of stocks. The lower CAPE is, as it gradually gets lower, you gradually move more and more in. So taking that lesson now, CAPE is high, but itâ€™s not super high. I think it looks like stocks should be a substantial part of a portfolio. Blodget: But probably less than the 100-year average return? Shiller: I think predicting something like 4 percent real for the stock market, as opposed to 7 or 8 percent historically. And that looks pretty good. The other thing is, you donâ€™t have to go into the whole market. You can go into a low-CAPE sector. Blodget: Interesting. Shiller: And this is just what Iâ€™ve been working with Barclaysâ€™ bank on, on products that would do this. Itâ€™s not selling well yet. Ticker symbol CAPE, which you can buy. It goes into low-CAPE sectors. Blodget: So is this a similar screen to the famous value screen that Fama and French developed? Shiller: No, itâ€™s a new one. Well, itâ€™s not new, Iâ€™ve done this for 20 years. But somehow, it hasnâ€™t been implemented as an investment strategy. The interesting thing is, we took the Fama/French value factor and ran a regression of returns on both ours and his. And they both come in significant. So it seems like we have another measure of value thatâ€™s different from theirs, and they both work perfectly. So Iâ€™m an advocate of going into traditional value, like Fama/French value, and our CAPE. Blodget: Are they significantly different? Shiller: They must be, because when you put them in a regression together â€“ Iâ€™m talking econometrics here â€“ they both come in. Blodget: Meaning? Shiller: Theyâ€™re both significant. Blodget: Independent of one another? Shiller: If they were collinear, if they were one doing the same as the other, then they would both drop out. Blodget: I think I understand. Last question on that: can you apply the same methodology to different markets and asset classes? If you were going to build a global portfolio of diversified assets, youâ€™d say the Australian market has a low CAPE, youâ€™ll go overweight there â€“ is anyone doing that? Shiller: Yeah, weâ€™re doing that. But we havenâ€™t with Barclaysâ€™. We havenâ€™t come out with a product yet, because its tricky doing things internationally. The one really big problem we had is that thereâ€™s an exchange rate problem. If you look at the relative performance of investments in other countries, exchange rate is really important. Another question is do think exchange rate means revert? So thatâ€™s what weâ€™re working on, and Iâ€™m optimistic that weâ€™ll have a product. But right now, we donâ€™t. We donâ€™t yet have it worked out. Blodget: This is going to be an affordable product with low fees, or is it going to be a typical Wall Street product with huge fees? Shiller: Well, our CAPE product has a 45 basis point fee. Blodget: Thatâ€™s good â€“ better than typical fees. Thank you very much, Professor. Shiller: My pleasure.

There's a hot new fashion trend on Wall Street— bankers, hedge funders and private equity guys are rocking some really funky socks with their suits.  But it's only on Fridays.  It's a movement called "Friday Socks" and it was started by Joshua Weiner, a 25 year-old who works at a real estate investment firm. Weiner previously worked in private equity and investment banking. "Socks are the most overlooked part of a person's wardrobe," Weiner told Business Insider, adding, "After a long 60 hour four day work week, it's nice to wake up in the morning and think about the next day off by putting on Friday Socks that suit up your mood."  Wall Streeters are using the Friday Socks movement to spice up their conservative suited up attire, Weiner explained. "It also helps to show your personality in an easily concealable or revealable fashion statement — instead of the standard black sock, blue shirt, white shirt, red tie fashion.  It's a way to have fun with your dress in a conservative environment."  Even though some banks have an uber strict dress code, Weiner says it's still worth a shot participating in the trend.  "I have seen at least two work cultures shift at the hands of Friday Socks," he told us.  "Some of my past bosses and colleagues have participated and I have heard stories of other bosses doing the same around the hedge fund/ banking/private equity world." It Started In High School  Weiner told us that "Friday Socks" started as a fun thing he did when he had to wear suits in high school.  "Back then, the socks were just a plain, outrageously bright, non-matching color — primarily to express my personality."   Weiner, who grew up in Rye Brooke, New York, said he's always made "outside of the box" fashion statements.  For example, he told us that for his senior prom, he wore a white tuxedo with a baby pink vest, baby pink bow-tie and bright pink "Friday Socks."   "As I started to wear suits more often they started morphing into much more fun designs, only on Fridays, meant to help me get through the last work day before the weekend, in a tongue-in-cheek sort of way."    Turning It Into A Business Weiner has been designing his own "Friday Socks," which he intends to sell.   "My background in real estate lends to geometric designs, but also some funky curvy designs. I incorporate bright colors to bring out the fun in my personality that is not necessarily exemplified at work or with conservative business dress," he said. Weiner also recently launched a website that's currently under development called FridaySocks.com.   The website is "to share the social movement, by sharing designs, photos, stories, and to purchase the latest in 'Friday Socks fashion,'" Weiner explained.  As part of his business plan, Weiner said he wants to use a portion of the proceeds to start a scholarship fund to promote college education.  "With a college education, young guys have a chance to get those sought after corporate jobs where they can wear Friday Socks to celebrate their weekends."   The website should be ready to launch within the next couple of months, he said.  Weiner's sock designs are already in production and should be available after the site is officially open.  'A Work Hard, Play Hard Social Movement'  This trend has also turned into a movement in the social media sphere, especially on Instagram with those participating using the hashtag #FridaySocks.   "I shared my pictures of my socks with a bunch of friends, calling them 'Friday Socks,' which began the "movement."  Weiner added that almost all of his friends in corporate jobs wear Friday Socks.   "The word has been spreading.  Friday Socks is a work hard, play hard social movement."
The U.S. housing market has been one of the bright spots of the global economy. But the data hasn't not been uniformly bullish. Economists have noted that new home sales has been a laggard.Â  And with housing starts roaring back, some are concerned that the market for new homes may soon see a supply glut. Here's TD Securities Millan Mulraine: New home sales to improveThe new homes market has been a laggard in the overall housing market recovery, and while new homebuilding and existing home sales activity have risen significantly from their lows, new home sales have yet to enjoy a similar turnaround in fortune. In December, we expect sales activity to improve modestly, with the pace of sales boasting a respectable 6.1% m/m gain to 400K. The increase in sales will add to the positive momentum in November, when sales rose an equally impressive 4.4% m/m, justifying the surge in optimism among homebuilders (as seen in the NAHB homebuildersâ€™ sentiment report) about sales prospects in recent months. In the coming months, we expect the positive momentum in new home sales activity to be sustained, though it is likely to continue to lag the buoyancy in the existing homes market. Here's a chart.Â  The concern is that lagging new home sales could cause another supply glut. TD Securities Â  From HFE's Jim O'Sullivan: While manufacturing has been weak, housing indicators have generally been strengthening. Indeed, housing is now the strongest part of the economyâ€”in growth terms, not levels. At 377K, the November reading for new home sales was just a fraction of the 1.389 million level reached in 2005, but it was up 15% from 12 months earlier. We expect the uptrend to continue in todayâ€™s report for December. High Frequency Economics The December new home sales report gets published at 10:00 AM ET. Economists are looking for a reading of 388k, up from 377k last month.
Apple welcome to the world of â€œCommoditized Productsâ€ The luster is finally falling off of Apple, and in the end they were just a hardware provider, who provided products which will easily be commoditized as we noted previously. Every spike in Apple will be heavily shorted into as margins compress for the next 4 years plus, i.e., eternity. RIMM says welcome to my world Apple, your hell is just beginning. If Apple couldn`t blow out numbers with their signature product, in their holiday quarter with an imploding stock price, forget about it, all downhill from here for one of the most overvalued stocks of all time. Further Reading - Apple Price Target: $50 Stock by 2016 Tech Graveyard: Where Supposed Growth Stocks go to Die Now this sets the stage for a couple of other stocks that are about to face the music as the earning`s season picks up speed. It was a nice strategy to buy HP after the tax selling season finished, and push it up with all the other dog stocks of 2012 in DELL, RIMM and many others. A nice strategy when everything else has been pushed up to extreme valuation levels, and much harder to push up near as fast. Wall Street must have all gone to the same investing conference again, as there was coordinated buying of a bunch of loser, barely alive firms that nobody in their right mind would own for the long haul and ran them up 10, 15, and 20%. Further Reading - 4th Quarter Earnings Will be an Unmitigated Disaster HP: The entire company needs to be written down This brings me to HP, who fits in this category nicely, just a complete abomination of a company. HP is in danger of going bankrupt at the pace they are descending into the mismanagement spiral known as buying a bunch of dead technology firms, and actually make these acquired firms technology even more obscure and obsolete. I have seen all I need to see with HP, there is no chance Meg Whitman turns this company around. She will be gone in a year at most, one way or another. At any rate, I could go on forever with a litany of issues regarding what`s wrong at HP; this company is going to get crucified in earnings after the run-up in the stock since the beginning of the year. HP is no value stock, it falsely masqueraded as a growth stock under Mark Hurd due to the illusion of acquisitions which HP overpaid for, and has become a bloated wasteland of dinosaur technology. At least a 6% Butt kicking after earning`s release! Microsoft &amp; Windows 8 Next up another dead tech company in MSFT, need I say more Windows 8, really? This is the most mismanaged company given its resources in the S&amp;P 500. As long as the most incompetent CEO, in the history of CEO`s, again given the resources available, in Steve Ballmer is at the helm of this firm the stock will be a serial under achiever. Good thing you went to Harvard Steve, as you have to be the only CEO who could manage to do so little with so much, and still keep a job, even as you let competitor after competitor pass you by in every new technologically innovative business. It isn`t even worth my time discussing this company any more, needless to say, this is where growth goes to die, and where Apple is headed right next to DELL, in the land of dead tech companies whose best business idea going forward will be determining the size of the dividend for shareholders to keep them interested in these stocks before they become completely obsolete. Amazon is the next Apple to fall from grace Now my favorite overpriced, oh excuse me Jeff Bezos, misunderstood over-valued tech company is Amazon, ticker symbol AMZN. I think this â€œmisunderstoodâ€ company has consistently missed earning`s expectations for the last two years without fail. It must be nice to be given a free pass on performance for the past two years, but this earning`s report will be different as Amazon is priced for perfection, and if there is one thing Amazon isn`t, it is perfection.  Yes, I know the investment thesis, but this is just all marketing crap. The same principle of Amazon coopting BestBuy`s customers applies to Amazon as well with the world wide web. Margins will be coming down for any commodity provider on the web. I understand this company quite well, and given the run-up in the stock, expect a nice 8% ass kicking come earning`s report in a few daysâ€™ time. Further Reading -Â The Smart Money Will Be Selling into This Rally Technology: Shrinking Margins &amp; Increased Competition  Ergo, these are three tech firms that are going to be taken to the woodshed this earning`s season now that the run to 1500 for the S&amp;P 500 is over, results matter, and these three tech companies are either complete no growth dogs, or over-priced retailers! Frankly, I wasn`t impressed with Google or IBM`s earnings, one missed and the other was in line, but I guess we just had to make a run at 1500 now didn`t we? But one thing is for sure, there are no cheap stocks right now! Moreover, there are a lot of companies that will be seeing their fair share of â€œprofit-takingâ€ over the next couple of weeks of earning`s season as performance is measured against the run up in the stock price! There are a bunch of over-valued companies masquerading as growth companies due to ridiculous valuations that just don`t match the underlying fundamentals of their respective business models or the economy at large.Â Â© EconMatters All Rights Reserved | Facebook | Twitter | Post Alert | Kindle     Read more posts on EconMatters Â» esivesind via www.flickr.com creative commons

“We” must make these sacrifices, it will be said, in order to deal with our mushrooming budget deficit and cumulative debt.  But most of the people who are making this argument are very wealthy or are sponsored by the very wealthy: Wall Street moguls like Pete Peterson and his “Fix the Debt” brigade, the Business Roundtable, well-appointed think tanks and policy centers along the Potomac, members of the Simpson-Bowles commission.  These regressive sentiments are packaged in a mythology that Americans have been living beyond our means: We’ve been unwilling to pay for what we want government to do for us, and we are now reaching the day of reckoning.   The truth is most Americans have not been living beyond their means. The problem is their means haven’t been keeping up with the growth of the economy — which is why most of us need better education, infrastructure, and healthcare, and stronger safety nets. The real median wage is only slightly higher now than it was 30 years ago, even though the economy is twice as large. The only people whose means have soared are at the very top, because they’ve received almost all the gains from growth. Over the last three decades, the top 1 percent’s share of the nation’s income has doubled; the top one-tenth of 1 percent’s share, tripled. The richest one-tenth of 1 percent is now earning as much as the bottom 120 million Americans put together. Wealth has become even more concentrated than income (income is a stream of money, wealth is the pool into which it flows).   The richest 1 percent now own more than 35 percent of all of the nation’s household wealth, and 38 percent of the nation’s financial assets – including stocks and pension funds. Think about this: The richest 400 Americans have more wealth than the bottom 150 million of us put together. The 6 Walmart heirs have more wealth than bottom 33 million American families combined. So why are we even contemplating cutting programs the middle class and poor depend on, and raising their taxes? We should tax the vast accumulations of wealth now in the hands of a relative few.  To the extent they have any wealth at all, most Americans have it in their homes – whose prices have stopped falling in most of the country but are still down almost 30 percent from their 2006 peak. Yet homes are subject to the only major tax on wealth — property taxes. Yale Professor Bruce Ackerman and Anne Alstott have proposed a 2 percent surtax on the wealth of the richest one-half of 1 percent of Americans owning more than $7.2 million of assets. They figure it would generate $70 billion a year, or $750 billion over the decade. That’s more than the fiscal cliff deal raises from high-income Americans. Together, the two sets of taxes on the wealthy — tax increases contained in the fiscal cliff agreement, and a wealth tax such as Ackerman and Alstott have proposed — would just about equal the spending cuts the White House has already agreed to, totaling $1.5 trillion (or $1.7 trillion including interest savings). That seems about right. Read more posts on robertreich.org »

The Fedâ€™s balance sheet just topped $3 trillion for the first time ever according to the Wall Street Journal, The U.S. Federal Reserveâ€˜s balance sheet topped $3 trillion for the first time as the central bank continued with its easy-money policy. The Fedâ€™s asset holdings in the week ended Jan. 23 increased to $3.013 trillion from $2.965 trillion a week earlier, the central bank said in a weekly report released Thursday. The Fedâ€™s holdings of U.S. Treasury securities rose to $1.697 trillion Wednesday from $1.689 trillion a week earlier. The central bankâ€™s holdings of mortgage-backed securities rose to $983.17 billion, from $947.61 billion a week ago. FredHow much QE is leaking into the economy? We have posted several pieces (see here and here) on how the expansion of the Fedâ€™s balance sheet is financed by reserve creation, which are held by depository institutions in the form of excess reserves and not circulating in the economy. In the chart below we try and get a sense of how much of the quantitative easing has leaked out of the banking system into the economy. The monthly data in the chart below is the year on year change ($ billions) of total Federal Reserve assets less excess reserves of depository institutions. Because the last observation of excess reserve data is from December the chart doesnâ€™t capture the latest effects of quantitative easing. Though the calculation is a bit noisy, the chart does illustrate why the massive expansion of the central bankâ€™s balance sheet has yet to translate into a significant increase in inflation. When credit begins to expand as the economy picks up the Fed will have to execute what George Soros calls the â€œdelicate two-phase maneuverâ€ and remove the excess liquidity from the financial system.

aldenjewell / Flickr2012 was a great year for U.S. auto sales. Morgan Stanley auto analyst Adam Jonas think 2013 will be even better.Â  From his note to clients: We expect recent strong SAAR momentum to continue.Together with Sandy replacement, fleet restocking and a housing led credit expansion, this should drive the SAAR higher to 16 mm in 2013 above our prior 15.5 mm est. and +10% vs.14.5 mm in 2012. We see 2013 NA production up 4% y/y to 16 mm. The main drivers of the higher SAAR include: 1.Â Â  Â Strong exit rate for 2012 despite headwinds. The SAAR exited 2012 with a 4Q run rate of 15.1 mm, including mid-15 mm reports in Nov and Dec. despite macro uncertainty. 2.Â Â  Â Sandy replacement demand. As per NADA estimates, Hurricane Sandy destroyed up to 200-250k cars in the Northeast region. This would represent nearly 1 out of 1000 cars in the entire country and include cars of various vintages. 3.Â Â  Â Fleet restocking. In 2H12, fleet sales fell sharply, partly reflecting seasonality and partly reflecting strong retail demand. As fleet sales adjust to stronger overall SAAR / macro levels (fleet is typically 20% of SAAR) we expect a strong fleet rebound in 1Q. 4.Â Â  Â Credit availability. Our credit availability index has risen for the last 6 months. Anecdotal feedback from OEMs and dealers also points to significantly improved credit availability, esp. with subprime customers and expansion of leasing. Here's where Jonas' team expects auto demand growth to come from globally: Morgan Stanley
But neither issue can be resolved by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s plan to decapitate the yen. Trade deficits aren’t the end of the world for Japan. But they’re the end of an era. Since the mid-1980s, Japan has booked large annual trade surpluses, to the total and ineffectual aggravation of US presidents and lawmakers. The surpluses helped fund Japan’s budget deficits without having to rely on foreign investors. Now, these deficits have become a mountain of debt over twice the size of GDP, unequalled in the developed world. But in 2011, that seemingly endless string of surpluses, on which the Japanese economy had become dependent, broke. Instead there was a deficit of ¥2.56 trillion, small by US standards. It was ascribed to the earthquake and tsunami, fuel imports, etc. A temporary blip. In 2012, the monthly trade deficits got worse, and over the last six months, they occurred in an uninterrupted sequence to reach ¥6.93 trillion ($78 billion), almost tripling from 2011. An all-time record. Yet, even during the campaign late last year, Shinzo Abe, now prime minister, vowed to toss all fiscal restraints overboard and pile even more deficit spending on that mountain of debt that had been funded by the now evaporated trade surpluses. So the cabinet just approved another round of stimulus spending, $117 billion, the largest since the financial crisis. It will be up to the Bank of Japan to print enough yen and mop up the red ink. It’s Abe’s effort to goose the economy, or at least remain prime minister for longer than 15 months, which was the limit for his hapless six predecessors, including himself, ever since Junichiro Koizumi vacated the post in 2006 (graph). And it’s causing a ruckus around the world. Politicians and lobbyists are accusing Japan of yen manipulation and of starting the next round in the currency wars, forgetting conveniently that it was the Fed that has been trying with all its might and for years to demolish the dollar, and is still doing so by printing $85 billion a month [The Currency Wars: Now US Automakers Are Squealing]. But Abe’s gyrations had no impact on the trade deficit in December. At ¥641.5 billion, it was once again worse “than expected.” Exports deteriorated 5.8% from December 2011, imports rose 1.9%. Of Japan’s three largest export markets—China, the US, and Europe—two had turned into a veritable trade catastrophe. China had overtaken the US as Japan’s largest export market. And Japanese companies were brimming with optimism. Then the Senkaku Islands “dispute” erupted—in quotes because Japan insists that there is no “dispute,” the islands being Japanese. It didn’t take the Chinese government long to rile up its people against everything Japanese. And the images floating around the world were ugly. At first, it appeared to be a spat like others that, after sufficient commotion, would be put back in the dirty-underwear drawer, unresolved but out of sight. Instead, jets were scrambled by the Japanese to counter jets approaching the islands from China, and ships were involved, and perhaps shots might soon be fired. Rather than a spat, it has become an element of China’s growing territorial assertiveness. Japan, which spends only about 1% of GDP on its military, can’t rattle its saber loud enough for China to notice. Instead, it has to rely on the resolve of its ally, the US, to keep the Chinese at bay. A resolve that China is testing. While a shooting war is somewhere between unlikely and unthinkable, given the economic ties between the three countries, tensions are rising, and tempers aren’t settling down, and Japanese exports to China are crashing. In November they were down 14.5%; in December, 15.8% to ¥906 billion. Worst hit were cars, trucks, and parts (-47.5%), machinery (-22.2%), and electrical machinery, which includes tech products like semiconductors (-16.8%). Imports from China edged down by 2.1% to ¥1.24 trillion. And the trade deficit jumped by 76.8%. This debacle is unrelated to the strength of the yen. It’s caused by the deteriorating relationship between two of the world’s largest trading partners. Knocking the yen off its lofty perch—it’s down 11% against the dollar and 15% against the euro since November—won’t have much impact. In that respect, Abe’s cure won’t work. Then there’s Europe. In December, exports skidded by 12.3% to ¥561 billion, after having plunged 20% in November. To Germany, which now may be in a recession, they declined by 9.2%, to the UK by 10.2%, to France by 16.8%, to Spain by 26.2%, and to Italy by 28.2%. These are crisis numbers, a function not of a strong yen but of the European economies that, despite ceaseless declarations to the contrary, have stepped up from a debt crisis to a full-blown economic crisis. And in this environment, Abe’s cure—demolishing the yen—will largely be ineffective. And here is an awesome, amazing, and powerful appeal (video with lyrical English text) to the people of Japan to open their eyes. It slams the nuclear industry, the mainstream media, government bureaucrats, and politicians of all stripes.... humanERROR by “Frying Dutchman” (video).

flickr/garryknightNew Bond Street, LondonLONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy shrank more than expected in the last three months of 2012, coming closer to its third recession in four years, after lower output from the North Sea and manufacturers. The Office for National Statistics said on Friday that Britain's gross domestic product fell 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter - a sharper fall than the 0.1 percent decline seen by analysts. GDP grew by 0.9 percent between July and September. The news will be a blow for Britain's Conservative-led government, which only a day earlier defended its austerity program against criticism from the International Monetary Fund's chief economist. The economy is now 3.3 percent smaller than its peak in Q1 2008, recovering only about half the output lost during the financial crisis - a worse performance than other major economies. Britain's economy also suffered a mild recession from late 2011 to mid 2012. The biggest driver for the fall in GDP was a 10.2 percent quarterly drop in mining and quarrying output, the biggest since records began in 1997, driven by disruption to North Sea oil and gas fields. This knocked 0.18 percent of GDP, while slightly smaller amounts of damage were done by a falls in factory output and in the 'government and other services' category, where the London Olympics had boosted sports and recreation services in the third quarter. At the start of 2013 one-off factors, such as January's snow, may seal the fate of an economy on a knife-edge between growth and contraction, with major retailer John Lewis already warning on Friday that snow had hit sales growth. Britain's chief central banker Mervyn King expects no more than a "gentle recovery" this year, while this week the International Monetary Fund cut its 2013 forecast for British economic growth to 1.0 percent from 1.1 percent predicted in October. However, even such lackluster growth could be derailed, as some analysts and business groups warn, by a hit to firms' and consumers' confidence from talk of a triple-dip recession. That prospect will add to pressure on the ruling coalition of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats to loosen its deficit-cutting drive and bolster the economy, or risk a hammering in the 2015 elections. Output in Britain's service sector - which makes up more than three quarters of GDP - was flat percent in the fourth quarter after rising 1.2 percent in the third. Industrial output was 1.8 percent lower, while construction - which accounts for less than 7 percent of GDP - grew by 0.3 percent.

NOTE: This post was originally published on Thursday January 24, 2013. How Big Was It? By far and away, the worst financial crack-up in history was Fannie and Freddie. That disaster has cost $142 billion. The knock-on effects of the collapse of these two were devastating. F/F went out of biz on September 7, 2008. The next weekend Lehman blew up. F/F put the nail in the coffin at the “Brothers”, and after that, all the dominoes were falling. With that in mind, I’m amazed that AAPL has blown off nearly twice the F/F losses in six-months, and there is not even a ripple in the water. Last night, in a few seconds of after-market trading, the stock got pasted for more than all of the losses for LEH. By the opening, the overnight losses exceeded more than LEH, AIG, GM, and Chrysler combined. The market gets smoked for 1/4 Trillion in a single name, and we’re trading at the highs. Go figure.   UK to Say “Goodbye” to EU? The UK will have a referendum in 2017 to determine if it want’s to stay in the EU. That’s so far away that it has no consequence today. I do think this sets up as a “big deal” at one point in the future. Looking at the calendar, there is something that will be emerging at the same time the UK referendum is due. The big economies in the EU have all agreed to a transaction tax. This tax will come to only .01% on turnover of stocks, bonds and derivatives, but it will devastate the domestic markets in France, Germany, Netherlands and Italy. As a result, London will get another boost as the financial capital in Europe. The folks in the UK will be well aware of the influx of foreign traders, the capital they bring in, and the office space they use. No doubt, the Brits will be laughing at the EU for creating their success. It just might prove that the EU’s transaction tax becomes the reason why the UK votes to opt out. The TT will prove that the EU has no clue how to run an economy. If that is how it plays out, I will get a laugh.   Who’s Getting DI? Social Security pays benefits to non-residents who have lived and worked (and paid payroll taxes) in the US. The info is available for 24 countries. All in, nothing mind blowing, some details: - 192,000 people, now living in their home countries, get SS benefits. The total benefits paid in 2012 was $500m. - Canada has the most number of citizens getting SS benefits (53K). Japan has 38k, Germany 22k and UK 18k. The full list (Link). -Canada has the most number on Disability, number two on the DI list is Germany. (Possibly the layoffs at Deutsche Bank led to back injuries?) Anyway, what’s missing are the numbers for Mexico. My guess is that the bucks SS heads South is larger then that headed North. I think it is larger than the total for all the 24 countries where data is available. I have asked for the #’s, if I get them I’ll let you know. Don’t hold your breathe for that article.   Hollande To Go After French ExPats? There is a silly story going on between France and Switzerland. This one has potential to spin out of control. There are tens of thousands of French citizens who live in neighboring Switzerland. There was a tax treaty set in 1966 between the two countries that established who would pay what – for 47 years there was no problem. On January 1, 2013 the French government published a new rule that completely abrogated the 1966 treaty. There was no prior warning or discussion by Paris. They sneaked it in on New Year’s Eve. The Swiss were insulted. Forget the merits of what was done, it was the tactics that were used. From one Swiss official: Bruce Krasting   This is about a small group of people (most of whom are well-off) who are getting muscled. It’s also about a small country that is also getting muscled. Nobody ever likes to get muscled around; how might “they” push back? The obvious answer is that a number of those who are affected will take up Swiss citizenship (many have lived in Switzerland for years). Given the circumstances, I think the Swiss would be happy to oblige. This sets up for more of those embarrassing “Depardieu” moments for Paris. French citizens willing to renounce their passports to get out from under oppressive French taxes. There is another angle to this that is a potential game changer. The new French tax rules are, in the end, a tax on ExPats. What the French did to their citizens living in Switzerland, could also be done to the French people who live in Belgium. There is the bigger question of what would happen to the income of a French citizen who resides in London or New York. A huge door has been opened, it’s not clear what’s behind the door. This could snowball into broader opposition for Hollande. He’s running a socialist state, while taxing like a dictator.   Pay Back?? My sense is that EURYEN 120 is the new normal, and it will prove to be the bottom end of the range, not the top. This sets up for a crisis in the EU. There has already been “noise” from some of the talkers. The question is, “Can they do anything but talk?” I say “no”. Over the past decade Japan has imported deflation with a stronger and stronger currency. They tried repeated to intervene in the FX markets, but they failed. The reason they failed is that the other Central Banks (US Fed and EU ECB) did not want to give the Japanese any support. There was no coordinated intervention. The BOJ had to stand in front of the whole market, and got overwhelmed every time. Now the tables have turned and we have a run-away weak Yen. The Fed and the ECB can’t intervene without the blessings and support of the BOJ, so they can only talk. This sets up as an asymmetric risk profile, it favors a weaker Yen, – at least for the next 10%. After years of suffering, there must be a number of guys at the BOJ who are laughing at how things are turning out.  It’s amazing how quickly perceptions change.
Earlier this month, private equity behemoth KKR published its outlook for 2013.Â  Among their theses was the expectation that global inflation remains low as Europe continues to delever. Henry McVey of KKR wrote about austerity in Europe and noted how fiscal austerity in the form of deficit reduction was slamming GDP growth: Fourth, the European fiscal multiplier is now larger than in the past, which we believe means below-consensus growth in the region again this year. Having been to Europe multiple times in 2012 to assess the macro situation, it has become increasingly clear to me that â€œthis time is differentâ€ when it comes to the relationship between fiscal contraction (the independent variable) and GDP growth (the dependent variable). Specifically, over the past twenty or so years, a one percent contraction in the fiscal deficit traditionally led to only about a 50 basis point contraction in GDP5. Today, by comparison, the multiplier in Europe is closer to 1.25-1.75x, we believe (Exhibit 20). As a result, aggressive monetary policy is less effective in offsetting current fiscal headwinds. As the exhibits above show, we link a significant portion of this relationship shift to excessively high bank leverage as well as some of the structural rigidities imposed by a common currency.

shefnermark / FlickrKamogawa RiverAMSTERDAM (AP) â€” Japan's benchmark stock index hit a 32-month high Friday as the yen continued to retreat against the dollar and investors cheered the new government's plans to boost the economy. Other stock markets edged up, notably in Germany where a survey showed growing business confidence. Evan Lucas, analyst at IG Markets in Melbourne, said he expected to see further surges in Japan's Nikkei 225 index after a Japanese government official indicated that the yen would fall further, helping the company's big exporters. The Nikkei surged 2.9 percent to 10,926.67, its highest close since April 30, 2010. In Germany, the Ifo index of business sentiment rose to its highest level since last June, with order backlogs growing. The report "nicely illustrates the green shoots in the German economy," said ING senior economist Carsten Brzeski in Brussels. "Even if the current harsh winter weather might delay the blossoming somewhat, growth should return, leaving the contraction of the fourth quarter quickly behind." Germany's DAX rose 1 percent to 7,827.69 points, by far the strongest performer in Europe. France's CAC-40 was up 0.6 percent to 3,773.63. But Britain's FTSE 100 edged up only 0.1 percent, to 6,273.21, after official figures showed the U.K. economy contracted 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter. If it shrinks for another quarter, it would be back in a technical recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction. The fourth quarter drop was worse than expected and shows the economy is struggling to make any lasting recovery. Meanwhile, Wall Street appeared headed for gains, with Dow Jones industrial futures 0.2 percent higher at 13,806 and S&amp;P 500 futures gaining 0.2 percent to 1,494.20. Looking ahead investors will keep an eye out for new data showing how much of the the European Central Bank's emergency loans to banks are being repaid early. The figure will provide a gauge of the health of banks in Europe â€” if many of them repay a lot of those loans early, markets will take that as a sign that they are now healthy enough to rely less on the ECB. Earlier in Asia, South Korea's Kospi fell amid fears that the country's exporters could be slammed by Japan's dropping yen. The benchmark fell 1 percent to 1,943.97. Hong Kong's Hang Seng lost 0.1 percent to 23,580.43 while Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 rose 0.5 percent to 4,835.20. In mainland China, the Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.5 percent to 2,291.30 and the smaller Shenzhen Composite Index lost 0.2 percent at 909.52. Benchmark oil for March delivery was up 39 cents to $96.34 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. In currencies, the euro fell to $1.34233 from $1.3371 late Thursday in New York. The dollar rose to 90.77 yen from 89.96 yen. _____ Pamela Sampson contributed to this story from Bangkok.
Gold is one of the most mysterious and misunderstood commodities in the world.Â  Despite claims that its not money, the world's central banks carry tons of it.Â  And despite claims that it has no practical use, it is indeed used broadly in technology. Here's a table from Morgan Stanley's latest Global Metals Playbook. showing where gold comes from and how it is used and where it will be used in the next six years. Morgan Stanley
Live-Stream Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer is doing a one-on-one interview at Davos this morning. The line of people who wanted to attend her session was so long that it stretched three-quarters of the way across the conference center floor. About half of the people in the line actually made it into the room. The rest were dispersed only after the door staff promised that the session would be live-streamed. Demand for the live-stream, meanwhile, proved so intense that the live-stream crashed. So now the only thing those who want to hear what Marissa Mayer has to say can do is follow along on Twitter. This, combined with what Marissa Mayer had to say (which I'll detail in another post), is very good news for Yahoo. Here's the line of people who wanted to see her... Henry Blodget, Business Insider

Yale professor Robert Shiller is one of the pre-eminent experts in house prices. Shiller created the "Case-Shiller Index," which tracks changes in house prices on a monthly basis and is the most closely followed house-price index in the country. We sat down with Professor Shiller in Davos to get his take on the future of the housing market. * * * Henry Blodget: Everybody in the U.S. seems convinced that the housing market is going to come roaring back, itâ€™s going to save the economy, house prices are going to rise, houses are a great investment again. Are they right? Professor Shiller: First of all, I challenge your statement a little bit. The Pulsenomics survey of experts â€“ they had 105 experts in their December survey â€“ and not one of them predicted a return to the boom that we had. The most optimistic had a real return for the next 4â€“5 years of something like 6 percent. Blodget: But thatâ€™s way better than zero. Shiller: Iâ€™m taking the most optimistic out of 105. We also had â€“ whatâ€™s that perma-bear guy, anyway, we had someone at minus 10 percent. I think that we may be recovering, but I also think that we may have further real price declines in the coming years.Â  People are overly â€“ we tend to focus on the latest starts and permits and other indicators, but I think that there might have â€“ and this isnâ€™t a confident forecast â€“ but there might have been a decline in our appreciation of this American Dream: detached, dispersed single family homes â€“ you have to drive for 45 minutes to get there from your job. And the idea has gone, well itâ€™s not gone, but itâ€™s diminished â€“ that this would be a good investment. So the latest data, ever since the crisis, almost all new housing has been rental. New household units want rentals. If thatâ€™s a trend, it means that home prices of single-family detached homes should probably go down, because itâ€™s hard to maintain those as rental units. If people demand that kind of â€“ I think theyâ€™ll sell at a discount. Co-ops and condos could have a different trend at the same time. Blodget: So what is your sense of the next five years? Do you think weâ€™ve hit bottom in the housing market or do you have to stratify it that way? Shiller: I think that we might have [hit bottom], but my biggest sense is that probably nothing dramatic happens either way. If the Pulsenomics survey is right, and itâ€™s up between 1 and 2 percent real, thatâ€™s plausible to me. But also down 1 or 2 percent real, thatâ€™s plausible. Iâ€™m sorry I donâ€™t have a more precise forecast. S&PThe Case-Shiller Index.Blodget: One of the things I feel that people might be missing is that if the economy does return to strength, at some point presumably interest rates will start to rise to more normal levels which will change the cost of mortgages and make them much more expensive. How much do you think the cost of mortgages affects the price of housing, and if interest rates do go from 4 now up to 7 percent, will that dampen house prices? Shiller: It would seem from economic theory that it ought to. If the 10-year Treasury goes from 1.8 percent to 7 percent, that means mortgage rates will go from 3.5 to 10 percent, or something like that. And that ought to affect home prices. And in a very broad sense, that seems to be the case. Home prices reached a low in the early 80s, right around the time Paul Volcker pushed interest rates up. But on the other hand, it doesnâ€™t fit very well, this whole model. Home prices donâ€™t look like an inverse of interest rates. Blodget: They donâ€™t? Youâ€™ve studied it hundreds of years of home prices and you havenâ€™t seen a correlation between the two? Shiller: No, in fact if you look at the path of interest rates since Paul Volcker, interest rates have just gone down secularly for 30 years. Itâ€™s absolutely amazing, how strong that downtrend is. And itâ€™s hit practically zero, itâ€™s at a record low right now. It canâ€™t keep going down, so now where is it going to go from here? I donâ€™t know. I donâ€™t see as much commentary on this trend. Somehow, there was a turning point, a major turning point with Paul Volcker, that we went from an economy of increasing inflation to decreasing deflation, and not many people appreciated how profound that transition was. But now, the question is where are we going now when weâ€™ve hit record lows. I wish I knew. Blodget: Well, presumably there are two options. Either weâ€™re Japan and rates stay low for 20 years, or they go back up. Shiller: The question is attaching probabilities to those scenarios. Blodget: Do you want to take a stab at that? Shiller: I donâ€™t know. This is something that, Bayesian statisticians have tried to represent ignorance by probabilities, and this is why my son is a philosophy Ph. D candidate right now, and heâ€™s interested in how to represent uninformative priors. Thereâ€™s all kinds of paradoxes when you try to do it. So we just donâ€™t know, and I canâ€™t attach a probability. Blodget: Thanks, Professor Shiller. Next.... Professor Shiller on the stock market. SEE ALSO: The Truth About Davos
1. Banks that borrowed from the ECB under the Long Term Repo Operation (LTRO) can begin repaying, if they want. Banks must notify the ECB on a weekly basis about how much they want to repay. The ECB will publish amount to be paid back and the number of banks every Friday for the next few years, starting tomorrow. 2. Banks borrowed roughly 1 trillion euros in the two LTRO 3-year operations (Dec 11 and Feb 12). Italian and Spanish banks are believed to have accounted for around 60% of the use of the LTRO, German banks a little more than 10% and French banks a little less than 10%.Â  3. Estimates of repayment range from 100-250 bln euros, but may come in drips and drabs. 4. Since the LTRO was designed to help with the refinancing cliff faced by European banks (and secondarily by the sovereigns), early repayment would be consistent with the easing of financial conditions. This essentially means access to market funding. Many banks have reportedly issued debt in the past few months. Bank borrowing from the ECB has fallen, so for example, Spanish bank borrowing from the ECB in Dec was the lowest since May and Portugal borrowings were at their lowest since Feb. In addition, deposits at Spanish and Greek banks have stabilized as 2012 drew to a close. 5. However, there is some fear that a two-tier banking system is crystalizing in Europe, with the large banks in the core countries having greater access to the markets than small banks and banks in the periphery. Although the ECB is not going to publish the names of individual banks, some banks may seek to announce their repayment on ideas that it will bolster investor confidence. 6. There has been some fear that the early repayment would push up short-term European rates and the implied interest rate of the March Euribor futures contract did increase by about 15 bp at the start of the year, but has since stabilized, following some calming words by an ECB official. For more than a week now the daily closing implied yield is between 26 and 28 bp.Â  7. The implication of early repayment and the reduced borrowing is consistent with a reduction of the ECB's balance sheet. As of Jan 18 (most recent data), the ECB's balance sheet was the smallest since the end of last Feb. The reduction of the ECB's balance sheet comes as the US Federal Reserve is expanding its balance sheet via buying $85 bln of MBS and Treasuries a month.Â  8. Some participants give a privileged place in their fx explanatory model to the monetary policy and in particular the quantity of money. While recognizing that monetary factors can influence foreign exchange prices, our experience suggests that other variables also impact.Â  9. Three market segments appear to be participating in the euro's advance. Central banks, especially in the Middle East, have reportedly been buyers of euros. Real money is reportedly buying (short-end) of Spanish and Italian bonds. Equity funds investing in Europe have also reported net inflows. Lastly, momentum and trend followers in the IMM futures have been buying euro contracts. The gross longs futures contracts are near their highest level since mid-2011, while gross shorts are at their lowest level since Sept '11. 10. Although most of the other major currencies have weakened against the dollar, the euro has been resilient. After rallying from $1.30 at start of the year to $1.34 by mid-Jan, it has been trading broadly sideways in a $1.3250-$1.3400 range. The trend line going back to the July '11 lows near $1.2040 remains intact (though sterling has convincingly broken a similar trend line). It comes in now near $1.31. On the upside, a break of $1.34 could quickly see $1.35, the high from last year.        Read more posts on Marc to Market Â»
