Long-Term Investors Should Embrace Tapering (Vanguard)  On Wednesday the Fed announced that it was tapering its asset purchase program to $75 billion a month, down from $85 billion. Despite investors concerns around this move however, Andrew Patterson at Vanguard argues that this is good for investors in the long run " because it's a sign monetary policymakers view the U.S. economy as being on more solid footing." He reminds us that "tapering doesn't mean interest rate increases are imminent." Tightening isn't likely till mid-2015. But he does think "the road to normalized policy is likely to be long and volatile." In this environment, Patterson thinks investors should stay diversified and reminds us that even if bonds aren't as popular anymore, they still "offer important diversification benefits with the potential to offset equity risk." 4 Major Advisor Recruitment Trends To Expect In 2014 (Investment News)  Tom Daley, founder and CEO of online financial advisor community, The Advisor Center, writes that there are four clear recruiting trends we can expect to see in 2014. 1. Advisors are choosing to join existing firms or† registered independent advisors (RIAs) and hybrid instead of investing in a solo practice. 2. Following on the trend that advisors are opting for existing opportunities, super ensembles, or large firms with $5 million or more in revenue "will continue to thrive." 3. Advisors are trying to offer advisors a transition package with more "long-term value" instead of giving them a lump sum up front. 4. Advisors are still trying to stay with their current clearing firm or custodian since it makes the transition easier. 4 Major Advisor Recruitment Trends To Expect In 2014 (Investment News)  Tom Daley, founder and CEO of online financial advisor community, The Advisor Center, writes that there are four clear recruiting trends we can expect to see in 2014. 1.

Institutional Investors Haven't Been This Happy With Hedge Fund Performance Since Before The Financial Crisis (Prequin)  A new survey by Prequin, a research and consultancy firm focused on alternative asset classes, shows that institutional investors haven't been this happy with hedge fund performance in a while. 83% of 148 investors surveyed by Prequin said hedge funds had met or exceeded their performance expectations in 2013, compared with 60% the previous year. Preqin Wells Fargo Is Said To Be Raising Its 2014 Bonus Cap For Advisors (Bloomberg)  Wells Fargo is raising its 2014 bonus cap for financial advisors, according to Dakin Campbell at Bloomberg News. Brokers bringing in revenue of $2.1 million can earn an 11% bonus, up from 8.5% in 2013. Those who bring in $300,000 in revenue can earn an 8.25% bonus, up from 2% in 2013. This is a part of CEO John Stumpf's strategy to raise assets under management (AUM) and retain brokers. JACK BOGLE: This Chart Was Useful In 1929, 2000, And 2007 (Business Insider)  Vanguard's Jack Bogle thinks the Dow Jones Industrial Average's price-book ratio chart, is the most important chart of the year. Book value represents the value of a company by calculating the difference between its assets and liabilities and this can show whether the stock is overpriced or underpriced. "I like this chart because it shows when market value deviates significantly from intrinsic value. It was particularly useful in 1929, 2000, and 2007," Bogle said. Business Insider
We asked over 100 portfolio managers, strategists, analysts, and economists across Wall Street what they consider the most important charts of the year. Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius sent us a chart that underpins his and much of the Street's view on why 2014 will be the breakout year for the U.S. economy. "2013 was another relatively weak year for U.S. growth because increasing fiscal drag, from federal tax hikes and spending cuts, offset the positive impulse from the private sector," says Hatzius. "We expect the private sector impulse to stay positive in 2014-2015, as both households and firms continue to spend a larger share of their income. With fiscal drag receding, this should allow the economy to accelerate to an above-trend GDP growth rate." Goldman Sachs

APThe White House and Congress are quickly veering toward another showdown over the debt ceiling. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew wrote in a letter to Congress on Thursday that the nation's borrowing limit will need to be raised by late February or early March. As part of the bill to reopen the government in mid-October, the debt limit was suspended through Feb. 7, 2014. The Treasury can use so-called "extraordinary measures" after that point to keep borrowing and paying the nation's bills for a few weeks thereafter. In his letter, Lew cited the recent bipartisan budget deal brokered¬†by Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and urged a quick resolution to the debt ceiling. "In this spirit, I am writing to urge Congress to take prompt action to protect the full faith and credit of the United States by extending the nation's borrowing authority. It is incumbent on Congress to allow Treasury to finance the spending levels established in the budget agreement as well as the commitments previously approved by Congress," Lew wrote in the letter. The budget deal sets topline discretionary spending levels for the next two years, likely avoiding the threat of government shutdowns over that period. But it doesn't do anything to address the debt limit issue. In the past week, numerous Republican leaders have come out and suggested that they won't accept a "clean" increase in the debt ceiling. Ryan suggested on Tuesday that House Republicans might demand that the Obama administration approve the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline in exchange for raising the debt ceiling. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday that he "can't imagine" a "clean" hike in the debt ceiling. Here's the full letter from Lew to congressional leaders: Jack Lew debt ceiling letter to Congress 
St. Louis Fed The Federal Reserve's latest quarterly Flow of Funds report revealed the first increase in U.S. household debt since before the financial crisis in the third quarter of 2013. In short, Americans have stopped paying down debt, and releveraging has officially begun. We asked 113 of our favorite portfolio managers, strategists, analysts, and economists across Wall Street for the charts that they deem the most important of the year, and this is the one we received the most. "The, frankly, token attempts at cutting back over the last few years are over, and it‚Äôs back to business for¬†U.S. households," said James von Simson, a portfolio manager at Thurleigh Investment Managers. There is a strong sense that this bodes well for the U.S. economy. "After Ô¨Åve years of persistent debt pay-down by households, the U.S. private sector deleveraging cycle appears to have come to an end, and with it is the increased prospect for a more sustained economic rebound," said Millan Mulraine, a director of rates, FX, and commodities research at TD Securities. "The Ô¨Årst quarterly increase in mortgage debt and sharp rise in credit-card borrowing in Q3 (shown in this chart) marks a crucial turning point for the U.S. recovery, and it suggests that consumer spending activity could again become an important driver for sustained growth going forward." Cullen Roche, founder of Orcam Financial Group, agrees. "This is a clear sign that the household credit crisis is coming to its Ô¨Ånal chapters and that the U.S. economy is officially stepping out of a very nasty chapter in U.S. economic history," said Roche. Now, we won't have to hear talk about deleveraging in the U.S. anymore, according to Matt Busigin, editor and principal author of Macrofugue Analytics. "This is both healthy and sustainable as long as the pace (of debt expansion) is below the rate of national income growth," said Busigin. "Deleveraging as an investment and economic theme is over."
Andrew SentanceGermany and the U.K. top the list of G7 economies that have seen the largest increases in GDP per capita since the turn of the new millennium, while Italy is the only G7 economy where annual output per person is less than it was in 2000. Andrew Sentance, an economist who served as a member of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee from 2006 to 2011 and is now a senior economic adviser to PricewaterhouseCoopers in London, calls this the most important chart of the year. "Growth in GDP per head is probably the best measure of economic progress over the medium term," says Sentance. "This chart sums up the 'New Normal' for growth in the West. Slow growth is the norm. A successful export-oriented economy like Germany which is tapping into strong growth in Asia and other emerging markets can outperform. And economies with deep-seated structural problems ‚Äî like France and Italy ‚Äî are underperforming, in the case of Italy very seriously." We asked 113 of our favorite portfolio managers, strategists, analysts, and economists across Wall Street what they thought were the most important charts of 2013. Here's what they sent us ¬ª
The Federal Reserve balance sheet has broken through the $4 trillion¬†mark. The Fed has been expanding its balance sheet since the financial crisis in an effort to stimulate the economy. Its latest iteration has been a monthly $85 billion a month asset purchasing program. But just yesterday, the Fed announced it will reduce (or "taper")¬†monthly purchases to $75 billion a month. That still means it will accumulate purchases on its balance sheet, albeit at a slower pace. Federal Reserve

Business Insider/Matthew Boesler (data from Bloomberg)Since 2008, China has been the largest foreign holder of U.S. government debt. According to the latest data available, China's portfolio of U.S. Treasuries totaled $1.305 trillion at the end of October, just shy of the $1.315 trillion peak value registered in July 2011. In recent years, this development has become increasingly salient in the U.S. political arena. However, China's position as America's largest creditor could be eclipsed in 2014, according to George Goncalves, head of fixed income strategy at Nomura. In his year-ahead outlook, Goncalves advises clients to consider such a "tail risk" scenario. "As Japan‚Äôs [quantitative and qualitative easing] worked its way to foreign bonds with a 1-year lag, Japanese investors could be forced to seek higher yields overseas," writes Goncalves. "In our opinion, Japan‚Äôs foreign bond buying may just enable it to overtake China as the top foreign holder of USTs, especially if/when China continues to diversify its holdings away." In a speech last month, People's Bank of China deputy governor Yi Yang declared it "no longer in China‚Äôs favor to accumulate foreign-exchange reserves." Yi's comments triggered speculation that China will become less of a source of foreign demand for Treasuries going forward. "They are probably going to keep their allocations reasonably stable unless there's a big policy shift, but it means they will possibly be buying less at the margin," Sacha Tihanyi, a senior currency strategist at Scotiabank, told Bloomberg News. TIC, CEIC, SG Cross Asset Research/EconomicsChina has actually been reducing its allocation to Treasuries for a while. "The PBOC has successfully diversified its FX reserves away from U.S. Treasuries over recent years, but the rise in FX reserves has resulted in no decline is actual holdings," says Paul Jackson, head of global macro advisory at Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale. "The day reserves stop rising, the PBoC will at last be able to reduce their actual holdings (by not replacing maturing debt)." Japan, on the other hand, is executing on the massive quantitative easing program it began earlier this year. Though smaller in absolute terms than the Federal Reserve's balance sheet expansion, Japan's bond-buying efforts are larger in terms relative to the size of its economy. Naturally, the effect of the program has been to suppress yields on Japanese government bonds. The idea is that Japanese investors, starved for yield they can't get from JGBs, will turn to U.S. Treasuries, which have become an attractive investment following a 130 basis-point rise in yields this year. Japan's portfolio of U.S. Treasuries was valued at $1.174 trillion at the end of October, so it still has a $131-billion gap to fill. Nonetheless, it remains a key potential development to watch out for in 2014.

Here's how the magazine described the winner¬†(naturally a Cuban cigar): Recent production Monte 2s (those we smoked were from April 2013) are extraordinary, teeming with rich but not overwhelming flavors of leather, such sweet spices as cinnamon and nutmeg and the cigar‚Äôs trademark tangy wood note.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics has released a¬†report on rates of people holding multiple jobs¬†in 2012. Nationwide, 4.9 percent of all employed people hold more than one job, and this rate has not changed over the last few years. However, multiple-job holding rates vary across the states dramatically, ranging from 3.4 of workers in Florida holding multiple jobs to 9.5% in South Dakota: Bureau of Labor Statistics Multiple-job holding is much more common in the North than in the South, especially in the Great Plains states (7.3% multiple-job holder rate) and New England (6.0% rate). A 2010 BLS report discusses some of the demographics of multiple-job holders, and the reasons people take more than one job. Moonlighting rates have been very stable over time, and do not seem to be strongly tied to the overall job market or unemployment rate. Women are more likely to hold multiple jobs than men, and whites are more likely to hold multiple jobs than people in other racial groups. Multiple-job holding also tends to be more common among people with higher educational attainment, with holders of advanced degrees nearly three times as likely to work two or more jobs than people without a high school diploma. The main reasons people take on multiple jobs are economic ‚Äî to meet expenses or make extra money. A decent share of multiple-job holders, though, are in their second jobs for non-economic reasons ‚Äî to get experience in a different business, or because they just enjoy the work. Unsurprisingly, these reasons also are correlated with education ‚Äî the higher a person's educational attainment, the more likely they are to work a second job for non-economic reasons.¬†
REUTERS/Tim ShafferJack BogleBusiness Insider reached out to the smartest people in finance and asked them for what they considered to be the most important chart of the year. Jack Bogle, pioneer of the index fund, sent us this classic. It's of the Dow Jones Industrial Average's price-book ratio, a measure that was popularized by Ben Graham, the godfather of valuation. Book value is the difference between a company's assets and liabilities. The lower the price-book value, the cheaper the valuation. However, this does not mean you should only invest with the expectation that this measure will immediately revert to its mean. In fact, this measure (and many other valuation measures) will drift from long-term averages for long periods of time.¬† It's further proof that markets will be irrational longer than you can stay solvent.

FactsAboutHerbalife.comShane DinneenThere's a rumor going around that Shane Dinneen, the Pershing Square hedge-fund analyst who worked on the firm's famous Herbalife short, has been canned.¬† We've been in touch with Pershing Square. ¬†The firm denies that Dinneen has been fired, according to a spokesperson. A person who answered Dinneen's phone said he was not immediately available but still with the firm.¬† Dinneen‚Äîa tall, red-headed native Texan and Harvard grad‚Äî has been at Pershing Square since 2008. He was the analyst Ackman tasked with researching Herbalife before the fund decided to amass a huge short position. ¬† From Vanity Fair:¬† Ackman listened intently to Richard‚Äôs pitch about Herbalife, but was busy at the time with a highly successful proxy fight for control of Canadian Pacific Railway. He turned the Herbalife idea over to two of his employees, Shane Dinneen, a young Harvard graduate‚Äîwho bears an uncanny resemblance to Conan O‚ÄôBrien‚Äîand to Mariusz Adamski, whom Ackman had met on the tennis court and then hired as an intern. The two read public documents, reviewed old lawsuits, watched strange selling videos, and learned about Herbalife‚Äôs bizarre, charismatic founder, Mark Hughes. They discovered that, a few years earlier, Barry Minkow, a convicted felon and founder of the infamous 1980s swindle ZZZZ Best, had in 2008 publicly called into question Herbalife‚Äôs practices. To avoid a costly legal battle, Herbalife had paid him $300,000. (Minkow is now in prison, for another scam.)¬† Last year, at a special Sohn Conference, Dinneen took the stage alongside Ackman and helped deliver the¬†342-slide¬†presentation on Herbalife. Since Pershing Square unveiled its Herbalife short a year ago, shares of the nutritional company's stock have risen more than 131%. ¬†The firm's bet, in other words, has cost it a boatload of money. And the pain (and losses) shows no signs of stopping.
OverstockOnline retail outlet Overstock.com will start accepting Bitcoins as early as the end of Q2 2014, according to CEO Patrick Byrne. They will be the first major online retailer to do so.¬†The news was first¬†reported on newsBTC.¬† Byrne told us by phone this afternoon that he considers himself a believer in the Austrian economics school, which says fiat currency, like the U.S. dollar, is fundamentally flawed since it is prone to inflation and manipulation. Bitcoin, like gold, is immune to this, since there is a fixed supply.¬† "Philosophically, we support Bitcion," he said. The decision was made just a few weeks ago, Byrne said, during a review of the company's information technology priorities for 2014.¬† For now, the store doesn't plan to actually hold Bitcoin once transactions begin. Byrne said they are considering three Bitcon payment processors that would allow the firm to convert Bitcoins to cash and assume the risk of the cryptocurrency's volatility. But he said that could change if Bitcoin derivatives come along that would allow one to hedge against the price going up or down. The CFTC said earlier this year that they are monitoring the development of such financial instruments. Bitcoin prices are up 18% today to about $670. Overstock.com shares are up about 3%.
JP Morgan started out 2013 by naming†First Solar, the Tempe, Ariz.-based solar panel maker, as a stock investors needed to categorically avoid in 2013. 2012's list had four names, but First Solar was apparently deemed so risky as to occupy that space by itself.† The reason, according to JPM analyst Chris Blansett, was that global oversupply issues, combined with subdued natural gas prices, would make First Solar's products less valuable. Blansett gave the stock an†"underweight" and gave it a price target of $14 ó at the time, the stock was trading at $34.† Those two factors basically held true. But it wasn't the whole story ó because year to date, First Solar shares have climbed 73% and now stand at $57. Here are three factors that helped the company thrive in 2013.
REUTERS/Jorge Dan LopezKit Juckes is looking way ahead. This isn't a picture of Juckes.We're still not done looking back at 2013 and sifting through all the 2014 outlooks published by Wall Street. So were a little shocked to see Societe Generale's Kit Juckes publish a note titled "The 2015 Outlook." That was not a typo. Going in to 2015, the question on top of his mind is this: "Will growth keep asset markets happy or will dismantling the easiest monetary policy since the 1920s bring the economic recovery to a dismal end?" There's no easy answer so he's approaching it with "trepidation." Of course to project out into 2015, he's working off his assumptions for how 2014 panned out. Here's what we managed to cull from Juckes' 2015 preview.† In terms of the global economy, he works off the assumption that there had been a divergence between the US and Eurozone, with the former outperforming. And this looks likely to continue. He sees 2014 ending with U.S. unemployment down to 6.3% and expects this to fall below 6% in the first half of 2015.† Rising wage growth in the U.S. will cause concern among bond investors in 2014, which will help send yields higher. He also expects the difference between US and European five-year yields to widen further in 2015 as the ECB is forced to ease policy even as the Fed moves to tighten faster than expected. He sees the dollar rally to get going in 2015. "As the US economic recovery continues the Treasury curve is re-pricing how fast it expects the Fed to hike rates, starving currencies which have been reliant on yield-hungry investors looking ever further afield for returns weíre looking for a further rise in TIPS yields in 2015 and that should see the† dollar continue to make gains." Turning to Japan, we could see the yen could push towards 115-120 in 2015 and this could help Japan which lags the U.S. and eurozone in export volumes. "A weaker yen helps, a pickup in nominal GDP helps, but demographics donít and the debt is a Sisyphean burden that may drag Japan down again in due course." Juckes also expects the pound to rally against the Euro in 2015. Oh and in case you were wondering, Juckes assumed 2014 outcomes include Germany winning the World Cup.
For weeks, e-cig advocates around NYC have been mobilizing to convince City Council not to ban the product indoors and in public places. An today, the Council will decide on the future of what could be a massive industry ó a $3 billion industry by 2015, if Citi is correct. It's no secret that under Mayor Bloomberg New York City has undertaken a major public health initiative. Combustible cigarettes have already been banned in restaurants and public parks, but since the FDA has not yet ruled on whether or not e-cigs are equally harmful, they have yet to be regulated. Imagine it like this: On Dec. 4, 200 protestors marched to City Hall to attend a hearing on e-cigs. Advocates on both sides presented to Council members, and all the while, the 200 protestors, led by Talia Eisenberg (the proprietor of NYC's first e-cig bar, Henley Vaporium) sat in the room and puffed on their e-cigs. They vaped. "They were open-minded," Eisenberg said of the Council. "They asked good questions but they were concerned there wasn't enough long-term research on the product." Henley is a shop that sells anything and everything you need to vaporize tobacco, from e-juice (a plant-based liquid of pure nicotine) to disposable e-cigs, to top-of-the-line e-juice vaporizers. Eisenberg started the Henley line as a smoker over three years ago. As the business grew, she and her partner Peter Denholtz, decided to build a brick and mortar shop in order to build a community. The shop's motto is "new ways for old habits." "I see it every day," Eisenberg told Business Insider, "People that have smoked for 34 years picking up e-cigs and never smoking combustible cigarettes again." Hanging out in the shop, we ran into some of them too. The argument on the other side, as Joe Nocera pointed out in a recent New York Times column, is that some believe "vaping" e-cigs could be a gateway to smoking, or that it could glamorize the combustible cigarettes. From The NYT: Yet, so far, the evidence suggests just the opposite. Several recent studies have strongly suggested that the majority of e-cigarette users are people who are trying to quit their tobacco habit. The number of people who have done the opposite ó gone from e-cigarettes to cigarettes ó is minuscule. ìWhat the data is showing is that virtually all the experimentation with e-cigarettes is happening among people who are already smokers,î says Michael Siegel, a professor at the Boston University School of Health. Still, as Thomas Farley, New York Cityís health commissioner pointed out at the e-cig hearing earlier this month, the number of high school students who have tried e-cigs doubled from 2011 to 2012. That's not something Nanny Bloomberg is remotely interested in seeing more of. We'll let you know how it all turns out.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics released a report today on projected employment growth of different industries from 2012-2022. But given the 10-year time frame, how accurate can BLS actually be?†We took a look at the agency's predictions for 2002-2012 to find out.  It expected employment in the professional and business services sector to grow by 30 percent during that span. In education and health services, BLS projected a 26% increase in employment, an increase of almost seven million jobs. In actuality, professional and business services grew 12.2% over that period. On education and health services, the BLS projection was almost exactly correct with employment growing 25.5% over the decade.* The agencies biggest error was in mining where it expected a 12% decrease in employment. Job growth in the sector was 56.3% in that period. Overall, BLS projected the economy to have 153 million jobs in 2012. We actually had only 145 million. Check out how the Bureau's projections held up in all 16 industries: Bureau of Labor Statistics *BLS industry categories changed slightly during the past 10 years. In 2002, there was one category for "education and health services." Now, there are two: "education services" and "health care and social assistance." We combined those two categories and labeled it the original BLS category "education and health services."
REUTERS/Eliseo Fernandez"...further downside from here..."Gold has been tumbling and it's currently straddling $1,200, a level it hasn't seen since June. This comes in the wake of the Federal Reserve's surprise announcement on Wednesday that it would begin tapering its massive bond-buying program, a move considered to be bullish for the dollar and therefore bearish for the yellow metal. UBS precious metals analysts Joni Teves and Edel Tully believe there's more selling coming for gold. "Ultimately, the Fedís decision should weigh down on gold and open up further downside from here," they wrote. "The gold market may have initially taken some comfort from the Fedís softer forward guidance which hinted at keeping the highly accommodative policy stance in place...In spite of this, the tone was still generally more upbeat: risks to growth and inflation were characterised as ëmore nearly balancedí as opposed to ëdownside risksí being highlighted in the past. Our colleagues in US Economics continue to anticipate that the Fed will wind down QE towards the end of next year and announce the first rate hike by mid-2015. Gold is bound to struggle as the Fed pursues normalisation." Teves and Tully also think it's bearish how well stocks did in response to the taper. "The positive reaction in equities further poses a challenge for gold," they wrote. "That stock markets took the Fed announcement well reflects the recognition of the distinction between tapering QE and rate hikes. In a sense it also highlights the overall positive sentiment towards the macro economy. Equities are in fierce competition with gold for investor dollars and this yearís trend of rotation away from gold into growth assets is expected to continue into 2014. Our equity strategists are anticipating around 15% upside for global equities next year." A strong dollar and an attractive stock market are bad news for gold. Meanwhile, gold's status as a safe haven is under threat from the rise of digital currencies like Bitcoin and Dogecoin. On top of all of that, India ó the biggest consumer of gold ó has been cutting back. Everything seems to be going wrong for gold.
PreqinHedge funds are mostly meeting or exceeding expectations these days.Institutional investors haven't been this happy with the performance of their hedge fund investments in years, according to a new survey by Preqin, a research and consultancy firm focused on alternative asset classes. In its December Hedge Fund Spotlight report, Preqin says investor satisfaction with hedge funds is the highest in its survey history. "Eighty three percent of the 148 investors that Preqin conducted interviews with in November 2013 indicated that hedge funds had met or exceeded their performance expectations in 2013, an impressive change from the negative outlook on performance investors expressed for 2012 returns," says Preqin. The chart at the top shows the decrease in those investors saying hedge funds failed to meet their expectations in 2013.
ReutersThe Fed announced yesterday that it would taper its asset purchase program to $75 billion a month, down from $85 billion a month. Many analysts have warned that this could be bad for emerging markets hurting their currencies and stock markets. But Bank of America's Ting Lu expects that the Chinese economy will be immune to the impact that QE had on other emerging markets, because of some of the economy's strengths.: Of course one could point out that the Chinese economy has its own weaknesses like its rising debt levels, high investment to GDP ratio, excess capacity, shadow banking, and a large pool of non-performing loans. To this, Ting writes that "Chinaís high savings level and conservative balance of payments give it a a lot of room for economic restructuring when some other emerging economies exhaust themselves with flip-flop short-term measures to fend off balance of payments crises."
The Wolf of Wall Street/Paramount PicturesLiving the dream.Tucked behind the Goldman Sachs building at 200 West Street, the Regal Battery Park theater was a fitting venue for last night's free advanced screening of "The Wolf of Wall Street," Martin Scorsese's highly-anticipated biopic about '90s-era pump-and-dump charlatan Jordan Belfort. Disturbing: Belfort's decadence. Equally disturbing: the finance-heavy audience's gleeful reaction to his behavior and legal wrongdoings. Credit Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio, who played Belfort, for keeping the high-octane, drug-filled movie entertaining for three hours (the longest Scorsese film by about 60 seconds). But my one major gripe was pretty simple: Jordan Belfort defrauded a lot of people ó and by the nature of his penny stock transgressions, many low-income people ó out of a ton of money. He then used that money, as one does, on cocaine, hookers, cars, and yachts. It may be great cinema to document his exploits, but there's a fine line between satirizing Wall Street's excess and celebrating Belfort's lifestyle. Put simply, the film could have done a better job making Belfort look like a villain. Or maybe the film did do that, and we were just watching with the wrong crowd. There were a lot of finance pros there. The theater is in Manhattan's financial district and the movie has "Wall Street" in the name, after all. Plus†you can actually see into Goldman's trading room floor from the escalator. There's a lot of talk about how Wall Street has "changed" since the financial crisis. Compliance is up, bonuses are down, the holiday parties are boring. But you wouldn't necessarily know that from what these guys were cheering at. When Belfort ó a drug addict who later attempts to remain sober ó rips up a couch cushion to get to his secret coke stash, there were cheers. Then, intercut with Popeye eating spinach, Belfort is irrevocably high on†Quaaludes (or "ludes," a muscle relaxer) and dumps coke into his nose to remedy the situation ó more cheers.  The worst, though, mild spoiler alert ...†At one point later in the movie, the feds get Belfort to wear a wire to implicate others at his firm. Meeting with his No. 2, Belfort slides over a piece of paper: "Don't incriminate yourself. I am wearing a wire." And the crowd goes wild. Don't rat! Stand by your firm! Bankers: First of all, don't cheer in a movie. It's weird. You can laugh, but no cheering. Second, guffawing while Leo attempts to evade federal indictment doesn't exactly help America's perception of your societal value. Hopefully this kind of euphoria was confined to one boozy, Financial District pre-screening (Paramount gave us popcorn and martinis upon entrance), because it would be a real shame if Martin Scorsese just accidentally inspired the future Jordan Belforts of the world.
Treasuries managed to escape yesterday's session relatively unscathed despite the FOMC's announcement of the first reduction in the pace of the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing program (a.k.a. "tapering") a few months before most on the Street expected. Today, however, U.S. government bonds are taking a hit. The belly of the curve ‚Äî which refers to Treasuries maturing in 5 to 7 years ‚Äî is taking the brunt of the damage (see Chart 1 below). It's considered the most richly-valued portion of the curve, and is most sensitive to changes in Fed policy, as a large portion of the Fed's portfolio is concentrated in the belly. "We wrote up our post views last night and concluded that the front end of the curve and belly would suffer," says David Keeble, head of fixed income strategy at Cr√©dit Agricole. "This momentum appears to be building this morning." Business Insider/Matthew Boesler, data from BloombergChart 1. Gennadiy Goldberg, a strategist at TD Securities, agrees with that assessment. "I think the market finally realized that tapering is here and that lower purchases by the Fed will weigh quite significantly on Treasuries," says Goldberg. "The long-end (10s and 30s) was substantially better positioned for tapering than the belly of the curve, and that is where we are seeing most of the selling, which has flattened the curve. I think the belly of the curve is a bit disappointed with the vague forward guidance provided by the Fed (no set target past 6.5% unemployment) and is cheapening because of that." Goldberg also notes that yesterday's auction of 5-year notes was weak, and today's auction of 7-year notes is "putting further pressure on the curve." 10-year U.S. Treasury futures are down 0.5% from yesterday's close. Tom di Galoma, head of rates trading at ED&amp;F Man Capital Markets, notes that 50,000 contracts ‚Äî $3 billion of 10-year equivalents ‚Äî traded around 8:48 AM ET, indicative of a big seller in the market. Business Insider/Matthew Boesler, data from BloombergChart 2.Meanwhile, at the front end of the curve, traders are pulling forward expectations for when the Fed will hike rates from current levels between 0 and 0.25%, where they've been since the financial crisis. Eurodollar contracts, which reflect the future expected yield on 3-month dollar deposits outside the U.S., are selling off, causing those yields to rise. Chart 2 shows the change in the eurodollar curve from yesterday's levels. Yesterday, Fed chairman Ben Bernanke said in a press conference following the FOMC decision that the Fed had "enhanced" its forward guidance on the future path of short-term interest rates by specifying that the FOMC would not hike rates until "well past" the unemployment rate hits 6.5%, the current threshold the central bank has said must be met before it considers hiking rates. "The Fed‚Äôs own forecasts for higher inflation suggest that the new guidance will unlikely be a hard constraint upon hiking rates and that the Fed‚Äôs unemployment rate forecasts are seen hitting the hard limit of 6.5% by the end of the year," says Keeble. "Additionally, by stressing that the pace of the taper is heavily data dependent, the Fed curtailed the market‚Äôs ability to re-establish the carry trade."
This is the most 2013 thing of the year. An Australian brand and marketing specialist and a programmer in Portland, Ore. who have never actually met have successfully combined the year's two greatest phenomena: Bitcoin, and doge.¬†The result: Dogecoin. And people are actually using it. If you're not familiar with the doge meme, it's hard to explain ‚Äî ¬†you sort of have to just see it yourself. Basically, someone on the Internet began posting images of Comic Sans thought bubbles in the imagined syntax of a devastatingly cute Shiba Inu dog. Variations on the meme look like this: DailyEdge.ie¬† There's no point to it; it's just one of those Internet things. But people love it ¬†‚Äî¬†you can see some "good ones" here.¬† About three weeks ago, Jackson Palmer, who by day works in Adobe's Sydney marketing department, and who'd been following developments in the cryptocurrency world, absentmindedly tweeted, "Investing in Dogecoin, pretty sure it's the next big thing." He got some replies encouraging him to pursue the idea, and a week later bought the domain Dogecoin.com. Inevitably, it got picked up on reddit, a hotbed of doge activity.¬† Meanwhile in Portland, Billy Markus had been trying to program his own digital currency that would appeal to a broader demographic than the profiteers who've flooded into Bitcoin. But the project had gone nowhere. Then he stumbled across Dogecoin.com¬†within a day or two of the site going live. "The¬†first thing I said was, 'This is so funny.' Then I said, 'I should just make this coin.'" He Tweeted at Palmer saying he wanted to go in on it, and before Palmer even responded, started reconfiguring Bitcoin's sourcecode, which is publicly available, to turn its user-facing elements into the doge meme.  Eventually Palmer wrote back, and the partnership was formed. A little more than a week after Palmer's jokey tweet, Dogecoin was launched. Again it got picked up on reddit, and instantly exploded. It is already ¬†the 13th¬†seventh-largest cryptocurrency, according to Coinmarketcap, with a market value (i.e. number of extant Dogecoins X price of $0.00086) of $8 million.¬†It now enjoys its own full blown ecosystem: in addition to the website, it has a dedicated blog and forum, and of course a subreddit. How has it done this? Largely through something called "tipping." If you're a geek who "performs" a "good deed" on the Internet, it's become common practice for people to "tip" you in your digital currency of choice. For instance: that kid¬†who held up up his Bitcoin wallet's QR-code¬†during ESPN's College Gameday got tipped thousands of dollars by the Bitcoin community for such a brilliant stroke of guerrilla marketing.¬† But it's become somewhat expensive to tip in Bitcoin, so people have turned to Dogecoin. Only about a week after launching, Dogecoin became the second-most-tipped currency, the pair say. They're hoping Facebook will accept a widget they've been working on that would allow friends to "tip" each other with dogecoin.  Still, what's so great about Dogecoin? Technically speaking, it's more of a variation on Litecoin, which runs on a cryptographic program called Scrypt. Like Litecoin, the time it takes to process a Dogecoin transaction is much shorter than for Bitcoin. There are also many more Dogecoins that will come into existence ‚Äî 100 billion versus 21 million. But it's the culture that's sprung up around it that's really driving it forward. Palmer says it comes down to having a lower barrier of entry for people who might be interested in cryptocurrencies but are turned off by either the price of or so-far dubious culture that surrounds Bitcoin.¬† "It's not taking itself as seriously, it's not being used by people ¬†worrying about whether they'll become rich," Palmer said. "It's something to share for thanks or kudos." Markus says his wife, who at first was turned off by his interest in Bitcoin, has started mining Dogecoin herself ‚Äî something you can do with your basic computer, unlike mining Bitcoin, which now requires industrial-strength processors. ¬† The pair say they have no intention of competing with Bitcoin, and both are still fervent believers in its potential to change online banking.¬† "It's a revolutionary technology, absolutely revolutionary," Markus says. "And it works as a store of value because it's deflationary, there will be a cap [on Bitcoins created]. It's just highly speculative, which makes it hard to use, to spend and spread it." How can you tell the Dogecoin phenomenon is not a joke? This morning, Bitcoin and most other altcoins are up about 20%. Dogecoin? Up 250% and counting. Wow.
APRussian President Vladimir Putin answers a question about Mikhail Khodorkovsky after his annual news conference in Moscow, Russia, Thursday, Dec. 19, 2013.  Today, at an annual four-hour Q&amp;A session with national and foreign press, Vladimir Putin announced something no one was expecting. The jailed oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Putin said, had recently applied for a pardon. ìHis mother is ill," Putin explained. "And I think that a decision can be made and the decree on the pardon will be signed in the nearest time.î If Putin does sign the pardon, Khodorkovsky will be immediately eligible for release. That's a huge deal. Khodorkovsky was once the richest man in Russia, and one of its most political ambitious. Following a series of clashes with Putin and members of the Russian president's inner circle, however, he was arrested in October 2003. He has been in prison ever since, first on tax fraud charges and later on charges related to stealing money and oil. His plight has made him an international symbol of Putin's ruthless streak and Russia's corrupt judiciary system ó Amnesty International declared him a prisoner of conscience in 2010, saying that the charges against him were "politically motivated." The timing of Putin's announcement is astonishing ó just yesterday he had agreed to a long rumored amnesty that will free between 2,000 to 5,000 prisoners, including members of the punk rock troupe Pussy Riot. The Guardian wrote that the move seemed like a "classic PR masterstroke" ahead of Russia's Sochi Winter Olympic Games next year, but to many, it felt like a dud. Human rights activists had asked Putin to release 30,000 people, and while Putin seems happy to pardon high profile he doesn't personally see as a threat (Pussy Riot and Greenpeace activists, for example), the omission of Khodorkovsky and opposition activist Alexey Navalny made it seem like a token gesture . It may seem strange that the Kremlin didn't announce Khodorkovsky was part of the amnesty, but the timing here seems deliberate. For one thing, announcing it in a casual comment after his now notorious annual press session gives it the maximum impact. Another factor is that Khodorkovsky may be getting a pardon, but he is not necessarily part of the amnesty; instead, according to the Kremlin, he recently requested a pardon, something any prisoner can do. The big thing with requesting a pardon is that you are admitting your guilt to the crimes you allegedly committed. This would be a major change from Khodorkovsky, who has always maintained his innocence. What would make Khodorkovsky change his tune? It may well be that his concerns over his mother's health have caused him to reconsider his political fight ó just last month he revealed that his mother, now 80-years-old, has cancer. But you also have to consider if he actually asked for a pardon at all. Putin claims that he has a letter signed by Khodorkovsky asking for a pardon, but Khodorkovsky's own lawyers claim never to have heard of such a letter (they initially denied it outright, but have now withdrawn the denial until they talk to Khodorkovsky). Khodorkovsky's son and unofficial spokesperson, Pavel, appears to have been taken by surprise by the announcement too (he declined an interview with Business Insider until he has spoken to his father). There are more questions than answers here. What happens if Khodorkovsky comes out and says he didn't write the alleged letter to Putin? Will Khodorkovsky have to refuse a pardon? He is due to be released next year anyway, what difference does six months really make? Perhaps the most important question, however, is what will Khodorkovsky do if he is released from prison? While his son Pavel has encouraged him to flee the country and live a quiet life, it seems unlikely that a man as smart, determined, and ó let's face it ó ruthless as Mikhail Khodorkovsky would happily retire to the sidelines of Russian politics. Putin no doubt knows that, just as he no doubt understands that putting Khodorkovsky on trial for the third time next year would be a disastrous PR move. Thus he has jumped ahead of the news in a move that is Machiavellian ó and classic Putin.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics is out with a new report today showing how employment will change in different industries. Not surprisingly, health care and social assistance sector will see the largest increase in employment adding five million jobs between 2012 and 2022. The construction industry will see an equally substantial rise, growing at a rate of 2.6% annually. On the other side, employment in the agricultural sector is expected to shrink by nearly three percent a year during that time frame. The federal government will shrink substantially as well.

Paring Unemployment Insurance Benefits / Food Stamps Is Bad for the Economy I often hear this from some of the cable news hosts and their guests. You see, according to these ìeconomic theoristsî, when the unemployed and/or lower-income populace receive various types of funds from the government, they spend these funds, thus increasing nominal aggregate spending in the economy. What could be wrong with that in an economy that is operating below its potential? Although I am all in favor of stimulating aggregate demand if it is demonstrably below potential aggregate supply, it is not entirely clear to me how increasing government transfer payments will accomplish this. The fundamental question I would ask those who make the claim that it is so is from where does the government get the funds to make these transfers? If the funds are obtained by cutting other government expenditures, then some entitiesí spending will be decreased by the amount that the recipients of the transfers spending increases. The result is no net increase in nominal aggregate spending. If the funds are obtained by raising some entitiesí taxes, then the spending of those paying the increased taxes will decrease, offsetting the increased spending of the recipients of the transfer payments. But, good Keynesians that the cable news economic theorists are, will say that those subject to the higher taxes (the RICH?) will not cut their spending fully by the increase in their tax bill, but rather will meet some of their increased tax bill by cutting back on their saving. And that wonít imply a cut back in some other entitiesí spending? One manís saving is another manís borrowing. And most entities borrow in order to spend. If the taxpayer cuts back on his saving, this means that he is cutting back on his lending. And if he cuts back on his lending, then this means that a potential borrower/spender will remain just that, potential rather than actual. Only if the taxpayer chooses to run down his cash balances to pay some or all of his increased taxes will his or his borrowerís spending not decrease. More on this run down in cash balances will be discussed below. If the funds are obtained through increased government borrowing, then the purchasers of this increased supply of government bonds will be curtailing their lending to other borrowers/spenders or will curtail their own spending in order to purchase the government bonds. Either way, someone elseís spending will decrease in order to fund the increased spending by the recipients of government transfer payments. The result is no net increase in nominal aggregate spending. Now, it might be argued that the purchasers of the increased supply of government bonds used ìidleî cash to pay for them. That is, it could be argued that the velocity of money increased in order to fund the government transfer payments. Perhaps. But can you be sure of this? With the elimination of Reg Q decades ago, bank deposit rates now tend to move up and down with open- market interest rates. So the interest sensitivity of the demand for deposits is not what it used to be because the interest differential is now more stable. MV = PT. If PT, nominal transactions (the Price level times real Transactions), are to increase and M, the money supply, stays constant, you have to explain why V, velocity, increases. Under another special circumstance (other than an increase in velocity of money) transfer payments can result in a net increase in nominal aggregate spending. That circumstance is when the increase in transfer payments is funded by a corresponding increase in the sum of Fed and depository institution credit, i.e., total thin-air credit. In this case, the recipients of the transfer payments will increase their spending and, by virtue of the fact that the funding of these payments is created, figuratively, out of thin air, no other entity need cut back on her/his current spending. Why do you think unemployment insurance benefits and food stamps are called transfer payments? Because these government spending programs transfer income from certain segments of the population to other segments. If income is being transferred, itís a good bet that spending also is being transferred. The nomenclature is a tip off that transfer payments do not, except under special circumstances, result in a net increase in nominal aggregate spending in the economy. Rather, transfer payments tend to redistribute a given amount of income and spending. The above is not meant to be an argument against transfer payments. I believe that the arguments for or against transfer payments are largely moral and philosophical. My only problem with you people arguing in favor of transfer payments is when you try to justify it in terms of macroeconomics. Congress Should not Oppose an Increase in the Minimum Wage as It Would not Involve an Increase in Government Spending or an Increase in Taxes I heard this one on cable news, too. As far as it goes, it is true. But, in my opinion, it does not go far enough. As I tried to illustrate in the comments above, the government has to obtain the funds it spends from some source ñ the nonbank public through taxes or borrowing or from the Fed and depository institutions. You might think of the government as an intermediary in the collection and distribution of funds. But just as the funding from an increase in government transfer payments has to come from somewhere, so, too, does the funding from an increase in the minimum wage. Who will get the bill for McDonaldís increased wage bill? McDonaldís customers through increased menu-item prices? McDonaldís stockholders through decreased profits. McDonaldís suppliers through decreased orders for merchandise from them. So, no, an increase in the minimum wage would not directly involve an increase in government spending or an increase in taxes. But it would involve a redistribution in income and spending away from McDonaldís customers, away from McDonaldís stockholders, away from the stockholders and employees of McDonaldís suppliers and toward McDonaldís employees. So, just as transfer payments redistribute spending and income, so does an increase in the minimum wage. I have also heard cable news economic theorists argue that an increase in the minimum wage would result in a net increase in nominal aggregate spending. Really? Explain to me how M goes up and/or V goes up in MV = PT as a result of an increase in the minimum wage. Or does P go up and T goes down? If, in fact, an increase in the minimum wage were to result in a net increase in nominal aggregate spending, then we could eliminate any shortfall in aggregate demand relative to aggregate supply by merely boosting the minimum wage to whatever level necessary to eliminate the gap. If only. Letís assume that the argument for an increase in the minimum wage is a moral one, not an economic one. Letís further assume that we as a society believe that people who work are entitled to some minimum income. If their wages do not yield this minimum income, then we as a society feel honor bound to, one way or another, boost their income to the minimum. If so, as a matter of equity, why should the customers of McDonaldís, the stockholders of McDonaldís and the suppliers to McDonaldís bear the biggest burden in boosting McDonaldís employeesí income to the minimum via an increase in the minimum wage? If we as a society believe that McDonaldís employees are entitled to a minimum income, then should not we as a society be willing to have our taxes increased in order to ìtop offî McDonaldís employeesí market-based wages either through a wage subsidy or an increase in the earned-income tax credit? I donít even want to get into the economic argument as to whether an increase in the minimum wage results in someoneís loss of employment. To paraphrase an old joke, if you ask an econometrician what is the effect of an increase in the minimum wage on employment, he will answer, ìWhat do you want it to be?î On the Wednesday Preceding Employment Friday, It Was Reported that Private Employment Increased by X Thousand This is not what I hear on cable ìcurrent eventsî news channels but on the cable financial news channels, whose producers should know better. On the Wednesday preceding Employment Friday, ADP/Moodyís releases its estimate of what it perceives the BLS is going to report as the change in private nonfarm payrolls for the prior month. The media might mention parenthetically, if at all, that this is an estimate of an estimate. Although the median absolute difference between the revised ADP/Moodyís estimate and the revised BLS estimate is only 44,000 between April 2001 and October 2013, there were 22 occasions in this timespan in which the monthly absolute difference between the two revised series was 100,000 or more. If the ADP/Moodyís estimate is that nonfarm private employment increased by 100,000 in a given month and two days later the BLS estimate is of a 200,000 increase, which estimate do you think will have the largest impact on the financial markets? If you answered as I, the BLS estimate, why does anyone care what about the estimate by ADP/Moodyís? The (Fill in the Blank) Economic Report Showed a Change Greater than / Less than What Economists Expected Ask an economist for a number and he will give you a number. To illustrate, some economists actually provide estimates of the ADP/Moodyís monthly employment report. Why? Because someone from the media asked. But if the media wanted to serve a useful function, they would ask two follow-up questions when requesting a forecast from an economist. How has that economistís past estimates of a particular economic statistic compared with the actual reported statistics? And, how did the economist arrive at his estimate? That is, whatís his model ñ explicit or implicit? If these follow-up questions were asked and answers obtained, I wonder if anyone would really care what economists ìexpectedî. Then thereís the post-release interview. Economist Aís forecast of the number was plus 100,000, but the actual number turned out to be minus 100,000. In the post-release interview, in which Economist Aís errant forecast is rarely mentioned, Economist A with great confidence can fully explain after the fact why the number turned out to be plus 100,000 and will tell you that next monthís number also will likely be near the same magnitude (itís the chameleon method of forecasting) without missing a beat or exhibiting a hint of shame. Along the same lines, economists shy away from giving a definitive forecast of a binary event. Rather, they like to hedge their forecast ìbetsî by giving a probability of a binary outcome. For example, Economist B thinks that there is a 50% probability that the Fed will announce today a tapering in the amount of securities it will purchase. Either the Fed will or will not make such an announcement today. It is not going to make a 25% announcement, a 50% announcement or a 75% announcement. Itís all or nothing! Itís Another Festivus Miracle! Festivus (celebrated on the evening of December 23, i.e., erev Christmas Eve, howís that for ecumenicism?) is not only a time for the airing of grievances, but also a time of miracles. And as Festivus 2013 approaches, the Kasriel household has observed two miracles. The first miracle is that our daughter, who has one more semester of law school left, has actually received an employment offer from a well-respected law firm. What is miraculous about this is unrelated to our daughterís qualifications ñ they are excellent (thanks to her motherís genes) ñ but is related to the depressed nature of the employment market in the legal profession. The other miracle is the recovery in one of our kittiesí health. After bi-weekly hydrations for kidney failure over a nine-year period (again, thanks to my miraculous wife), our otherwise healthy little Dee took a sudden turn for the worse last week. Now, miraculously (and with stepped up hydration) she seems to have rallied back to her lovable, quirky, independent self.
Howard Smith-USA TODAY SportsThe Philadelphia Fed's survey of business conditions climbed just 0.5 points to 7.0 from a prior reading of 6.5.¬† Consensus was for a print of 10.0.¬† Full release ¬ª The labor subcomponent only climbed a point. Still, the index has now been positive for seven consecutive months. The current shipments and new orders indices both increased after falling in November. Capital Economics Amna Asaf commented in a note: "The slight uptick in the US Philly Fed manufacturing index to +7.0 in December, from +6.5, along with the improvement in some of the more forward-looking sub-indices, suggests that the improvement in manufacturing is being sustained. "Looking at the Philly Fed breakdown, the new orders index rebounded to +15.4, from +11.8, and the employment index inched higher to +2.2, from +1.1. Nevertheless, thanks to some sharp declines in the inventories and supplier delivery indices, a simple weighted average of the five main sub-indices actually fell slightly to +7.3 in December, from +7.4.  "Overall, the headline index remains at a decent level whereas, even after the latest rebound, the alternative Empire State index (released¬†on Monday) is only just above zero. Together, the two regional indices point to a modest drop back in the national ISM index in December.¬†¬†We expect any decline to be very small, however, because the ISM index appears to be more influenced by larger exporters, who appear to be benefitting from the recovery in Europe." Goldman Sachs economist Jan Hatzius¬†considers it one of the best predictors¬†of overall U.S. economic growth. But Citi's Peter D'Antonio disagrees. "In the absence of data we caution against looking at the Philly survey, as it is notoriously erratic and poorly correlated with actual activity, in our view," wrote D'Antonio in a preview of the release.

REUTERS/Robert GalbraithExisting home sales for November fell 4.3% month-over-month in November, to an annualized pace of 4.9 million. This missed expectations for a 2% fall to an annualized pace of 5.2 million. This compares with a 3.2% fall to 5.12 million in October. The national median existing-home price was up 9.4% on the year to $196,300. Total housing inventory fell 0.9% to 2.09 million home for sales, which represents a 5.1 month supply at the current sales pace. Distressed homes accounted for 14% of November sales, unchanged from October, but down from 22% in October. Bill McBride at Calculated Risk pointed out that a fall in existing home sales could be good, if the decline was led by fewer distressed sales while non-distressed home sales are actually ticking up. "Home sales are hurt by higher mortgage interest rates, constrained inventory and continuing tight credit," according to Lawrence Yun, chief NAR economist.  "There is a pent-up demand for both rental and owner-occupied housing as household formation will inevitably burst out, but the bottleneck is in limited housing supply, due to the slow recovery in new home construction. As such, rents are rising at the fastest pace in five years, while annual home prices are rising at the highest rate in eight years." Now that the Fed has announced that it is tapering back its asset purchases to $75 billion a month, down from $85 billion a month, some like Redfin's Ellen Haberle think mortgage rates will hit 5% and possibly move higher in the coming weeks, and that this will be a "tough reality check for many homebuyers." Rising mortgage rates and the upcoming Qualified Residential Mortgage rules that are expected to bring a lot more scrutiny to process loans have weighed on the series. Pending home sales, considered a leading indicator for future existing home sales, have been falling sharply. This suggests that existing home sales will be ticking lower. Existing home sales account for a larger share of the market than new homes.
YouTubeSomething like this, maybe.As office Christmas party season approaches, more of the same is likely for Christmas parties at investment banks: namely sedate affairs held for small groups of bankers away from the public eye. Such has been the way of things ever since the financial crisis. However, ‚Äôtwas not always so. Before banking and opulence became socially unacceptable, bankers were very often treated to decadent parties of lavish extravagance. On Wall Street, parties in upscale clubs were¬†common.Geraint Anderson, who catalogues banking hedonism in his novel¬†Cityboy¬†and formerly worked for Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein,¬†says the most popular venue for such events in London was once the Honourable Artillery Company on City Road. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd always drink shots and pints beforehand and would arrive completely drunk and go the fairground rides,‚Äù he says. Even the sedate Dutch bank ABN AMRO seems to have gone in for something special : ‚ÄúThe parties were ridiculous,‚Äù says one ex-ABN banker, ‚Äúthere were fairground rides and a shopping centre‚Ä¶¬†And then one year they cancelled the Christmas party and gave everyone¬†¬£10 to spend as long as they didn‚Äôt go out in groups of more than 8.‚Äù In 2006, one unnamed US finance firm was¬†said¬†to have held its London Christmas party at Madame Tussauds. ¬†Following¬†the event, it was found that two of the waxworks had lost their heads and Jennifer Aniston was missing a finger. David Charters, a former MD of Deutsche Bank, says he never attended the Christmas parties of the past because they were so wild: ‚ÄúThey were company wide and something to avoid.‚Äù We asked Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, RBS and UBS for information on their Christmas party plans this year. None were prepared to comment. Off the record, the general message for 2012 festivities is low cost and low key. Conversely, these are the 10 most notorious examples of what it used to be like, once. In 2000, Bloomberg¬†reportedly¬†spent¬†¬£1m on a London Christmas party based on the seven deadly sins. The event was said to include 10 bars, one of which served only truffles and sweets to denote gluttony, as well as¬†neck-massage stations, manicure booths, a sushi bar, cabaret, casino, drag queens, and live bands. Also included was a‚Äùlust room‚Äù with a 25-foot-wide bed covered in purple satin. In 2001, Robbie Williams was at the height of his fame, having already released two popular solo albums and not yet attempted to reunite with Take That. This was no barrier when it came to booking him for the Deutsche equities party at the Equinox nightclub in London, which heapparently attended¬†with 200 fans and Geri Halliwell. The party took place in February, and may not have been solely for Christmas, but still. Separately, at the Deutsche Bank London Christmas party in 2000, male staff were¬†said to¬†arrange for the attendance of escort girls. This became a contributory factor in a sex discrimination case filed against the bank later on. This alleged party appears to have become an urban myth. Anderson claims that Goldman‚Äôs 2004 Christmas party was notorious at the time and involved a fight between a Goldman banker dressed as a chav and a Goldman banker dressed as a dalmation. Goldman declined to comment. As with Deutsche, Goldman has been accused of inviting call girls to its Christmas parties in the past. At a¬†sex discrimination tribunal¬†in 2010, one former US employee alleged that female escorts were invited to the 2007 sales Christmas party and they turned up in,¬†‚Äùshort black skirts, strapless tops and Santa hats.‚Äù In 2001, RBS‚Äôs leveraged finance group threw a Brazilian-themed Christmas party in the Oxo Tower. There, it was¬†said that¬†John Hourican, the current investment banking CEO, astounded everyone with his excellent Samba dancing in the company of two Brazilian dancers,¬†Solange and Danda. By 2009, most banks had opted to have more subdued staff parties. Deutsche Bank, however, ran an¬†open bar for its US employees at 230 Fifth, an elite New York lounge. This was said to be followed by an¬†after party¬†at a nearby saloon bar at which 100 bankers allegedly engaged in¬†‚Äòcar-bomb races‚Äô¬†and some vomited on the floor. In¬†London that year, Deutsche held a seated dinner party followed by dancing at the Cuckoo Club ‚Äì a 5,000 square foot¬†‚Äòexclusive private members club‚Äô¬†in the west end. This all came after the 2008 watershed and after 2006, when Deutsche¬†announced¬†that it was stopping Christmas parties.

That title goes to Microsoft chairman Bill Gates, who added US$11.5 billion to his personal fortune in 2013, ending the year with assets totaling US$72.6 billion. In number three spot on the list is American casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, who raked in US$11.4 billion in 2013 from his gambling properties in Las Vegas, Macau and Singapore. His personal net worth is estimated to be more than US$35 billion. The individuals on the top 10 list collectively gained $101.8 billion in 2013, an average gain of US$10.2 billion each. The combined wealth of the 10 individuals now totals US$347 billion, up from US$245 billion in January 2013. On average, they made US$29 million per day in 2013, and increased their wealth by 41.6 percent, outperforming the 24 percent returns seen in the S&amp;P 500 this year.

REUTERS/Yuya ShinoJapan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe fist pumps.Since its election last December, Japan's new government has radically altered the country's monetary and fiscal policy. The man behind the change ó Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe ó has, quite simply, stimulated like nobody's business†in an effort to jump start a long-moribund economy. The long-term consequences of "easy money," the critics will tell you, may outweigh the short-term jolt. For now, The Nikkei is up 50% year to date. The yen, which Abe has sought to devalue, has reached lows against the dollar and aided Japanese exports. While the market's current reaction to "Abenomics" has been a big story of 2013, how Japan's real economy reacts in the years to come ó GDP growth and the end to deflation ó will cement Abe's legacy (not to mention his sidekick Haruhiko Kuroda, governor of the Bank of Japan). Abe's policy approach has three prongs (or "arrows"): quantitative easing-like monetary stimulus, government spending, and structural reforms to make Japanese businesses more competitive. Interestingly, Abe served a first term as prime minister, from 2006-2007, but resigned amid low approval ratings. Now, Abenomics seems to have "worked," insofar as the economy chugs along with some†signs of life. Looking forward, these "extraordinarily expansive" policies will lead to more growth in 2014,†according to PIMCO's Saumil Parikh. "The lagged positive effects of easy monetary policy will be felt in steady consumption, higher investment and better net trade contributions," he writes. "But, tighter fiscal policy via higher consumption tax rates will likely cap the growth trajectory somewhat as Japan looks to find ways to transition to a self-sustained growth path in the year ahead. Expect Japan to grow between†1%ñ1.5%†next year," Parikh predicts. There's still a long way to go.

btckeychain/flickrIf you think Bitcoin has devolved into a warren of overly zealous programming and profiteering, we've got the guy for you. Alex Payne is a former Twitter engineer who among other things now works as an advisor for†Simple.com, a personal banking startup.†† In a new post on his personal blog, titled†Bitcoin, Magical Thinking, and Political Ideology,†Payne blasts the culture of wide-eyed optimism and do-gooder-ism that's been used by some to justify the enormous investment ó Payne calls it greed óBitcoin has received in the past few months. "With its influx of finance mercenaries, the Bitcoin community is a grim illustration of greed running roughshod over meaningful progress," he writes.† As a financial tool itself, Bitcoin in some ways poses a threat to Simple.com, so we need to take some of Payne's criticisms with a grain of salt. † Payne starts out by attacking mega investment firm Andreessen Horowitz, which just put $25 million into Coinbase, one of the largest Bitcoin "wallet" services in the world.†Andreessen's Chris Dixon called out the press for portraying Bitcoin as a bubble mostly used to buy drugs online. In†Silicon Valley, Dixon said,†"Bitcoin is generally viewed as a profound technological breakthrough."† For Payne, this is an example of†"nerds-do-it-better paternalism."† Particular vexing, he argues, is the claim that Bitcoin can address the needs of the "underbanked," or those without access to basic financial services. He writes: "Silicon Valley has a seemingly endless capacity to mistake social and political problems for technological ones, and Bitcoin is just the latest example of this selective blindness. The underbanked will not be lifted out of poverty by conducting their meager daily business in a cryptocurrency rather than a fiat currency, even if Bitcoin or its ilk manages to reduce marginal transaction costs (at scale and in full regulatory compliance, that is). But then, we should note that Dixon wasnít talking about lifting anyone out of poverty, just 'offer[ing them] low-cost financial services'." This is a subject we've recently written about ó BI's Jim Edwards says the Valley now is now "living inside a bubble of tone-deaf arrogance." For Payne,†Bitcoin represents the latest example of this.† Payne also goes after Bitcoin's core premises, calling it "a marriage of dubious technology and†questionable†economics." Bitcoin theft "rampant," he claims, and says greater regulation would defeat Bitcoin's claim as a decentralized medium free from outside intervention. "If the broader Bitcoin experiment doesnít implode, the currency will be regulated just as any other," he writes. "In this best-case scenario for Bitcoin, what of the benefits Dixon claims?"† He concludes: "Iíve enjoyed the thought experiment of Bitcoin as much as the next nerd, but itís time to dispense with the opportunism and adolescent fantasies of a crypto-powered stateless future and return to the work of building technology and social services that meaningfully and accountably improve our collective quality of life." There's a lot of truth here, though more perhaps about the culture than the currency itself, which has survived various hacking attempts. We noted yesterday how the top post on the Bitcoin reddit was a link to a suicide hotline in the wake of Bitcoin's enormous price drop in the past 48 hours.† If Bitcoin adoption grows, some of these fears may be allayed. But Payne makes a strong case that these †issues will make that adoption quite difficult to begin with.
On Wednesday, Oracle president Mark Hurd got a couple of questions from Wall Street analysts about the state of Oracle's salesforce. During the company's quarterly conference call, he categorically denied that another reorganization was taking place. "We don't have any salespeople changing territory, changing accounts. We're not reorg-ing anything. If anything, we're actually really happy with the model we're in," he said. And he had the numbers behind him: On Wednesday, Oracle had its first beat-the-street quarter, after three whiffs in a row. That's a hopeful sign. Changes to Oracle's North American sales force and/or its hardware unit were rumored to be quietly under way, Wall Street analyst Pat Walravens, director of technology research for JMP Securities told Business Insider earlier this week. It's all part of a never-ending stream of stories from current and former salespeople complaining that Hurd's sales plan isn't working. (Oracle has a massive, thousands-strong salesforce, so it's not particularly surprising that some of them are grumblers.) About two years ago, Hurd began restructuring Oracle's legendary sales force, hiring thousands more sales people, shrinking territories and asking salespeople to specialize in particular products. As Oracle CEO Larry Ellison described it on Wednesday's call: "Mark has emphasized that we haven't made any changes and that's absolutely true. A while ago though, we decided we had to line up an HCM [Human Capital Management software] sales force directly against Workday. That's all they think about every day. We have another [team] that competes against Salesforce.com ... another team that focuses on SAP. " Oracle is no longer hiring, Hurd said on Wednesday, and its sales team is fully staffed. Revenue was up 2% from the year-ago quarter, to $9.28 billion. That's healthy but not stunning: All of it was from software license renewal contracts and product support contracts (which covers things like tech support). That revenue came from existing customers, not new software, cloud or hardware sales. On the analyst call, CFO Safra Catz was asked if Oracle was going to continue to remain one of the most profitable tech companies ever. She said that depends on the sales force: "What you can see in our numbers right now, year over year, the difference is that we've invested in sales capacity right now compared to last year, and we expect that to pay off." Josh Olson, technology analyst for Edward Jones, told Business Insider that Oracle has about two more quarters to show that Hurd's overhaul is working. "Oracle is right on cusp of a potential breakthrough, but keeps kind of teasing us," Olson said. "Weíve been looking for an inflection point and it keeps getting pushed out and pushed out. If we donít see it in the next few quarters, our concerns would be heightened." Salespeople have told Business Insider that under Hurd's plan their territories are too small, and there are too many of them all hitting up the same customers. The revenue increase, however, suggests those criticisms may not be seeing the bigger picture. Meanwhile, Oracle's management insists it's got a line-up of new products that enterprises are eager to buy, including new cloud computing products, new hardware designed to run its apps, and a new database, the 12c. The database market is Oracle's bread-and-butter. The 12c database was created for cloud computing and runs at "ungodly" speeds, as Ellison once described it.  "We've seen more interest in 12c than any database version in recent memory," Ellison said on Wednesday. He predicted that the company would see "very rapid uptake" in sales of this database in 2014 and 2015. Olson says that if Oracle doesn't deliver on those promises and posts "another big miss" in its fourth quarter, the one that ends in June, that means the "rumors of the sales force being disgruntled" could be true. Or it could mean that enterprises are starting to use new, rival database technologies like Hadoop or noSQL databases. Olson is bullish that Oracle will do well, and the changes in the sales force will pay off. Edward Jones has reiterated its buy rating for Oracle, he said.
Most people were surprised by the Federal Reserve's announcement to begin tapering its quantitative easing program on Wednesday. Specifically, it said it would reduce its monthly purchases of $85 billion worth of bonds by $10 billion. Some feared that such an announcement would cause stocks to fall and interest rates to spike as it would reflect a source of liquidity being pulled out of the financial markets. However, stocks actually jumped. And surprisingly, interest rates did very little. Morgan Stanley's Ted Wieseman discusses that latter head-scratcher in his US Treasury Daily Commentary. Essentially, Wieseman argued that the Fed really nailed it with its dovish language (i.e. enhanced forward rate guidance) that offset the tapering announcement. "The clear message of the ‚Äúenhanced‚Äù forward rate guidance, via the stronger language on the unemployment rate threshold and the introduction of the downside inflation language, was lower for longer on the fed funds rate even as asset purchases start to be scaled down," said Wieseman. "And the initial market reaction was that this guidance is credible despite the earlier start of QE tapering, a separation Fed leaders were completely unable to achieve in the spring and summer ahead of the previously expected September start to tapering." Back in May when Chairman Bernanke initially floated the idea of tapering QE, interest rates surged.¬† Basically, markets seemed to interpret the tapering of purchases as an actual tightening of monetary policy. Repeatedly, we heard experts struggle to explain that taper was not tightening. But based on the calm reaction in the bond markets, it appears that the traders and investors finally acknowledge this. Credibility is elemental to the Fed's efforts to move forward with a monetary policy that relies more heavily on words rather than explicit asset purchases.
There's a devastating take down of Bitcoin getting passed around this morning. It was written by Alex Payne, a former Twitter engineer, who was CTO of Bank Simple, a startup trying to make banking easier. He's no longer at Bank Simple.¬† The full thing is worth a read, but there's one sentence that stood out: Silicon Valley has a seemingly endless capacity to mistake social and political problems for technological ones, and Bitcoin is just the latest example of this selective blindness. His post is largely a reaction to venture firm Andreessen Horowitz investing in bitcoin startup Coinbase.  Andreessen partner Chris Dixon explained the firm's investment in Coinbase by talking about all the stuff Bitcoin could do. In the above sentence, Payne was reacting to Dixon saying, bitcoin could create "low-cost financial services to people who, because of financial or political constraints, don‚Äôt have them today." Bitcoin may do a lot of things, but it is highly unlikely to help the impoverished, or people that struggle to get bank accounts. You need a computer, and a certain degree of sophistication to get bitcoins. And, even then, it's not a great idea, at least not right now. If you don't have much money and you roll it into bitcoin, you could be wiped out as the currency's price fluctuates all over the place.¬† As Payne notes, this is another example of seeing a social problem and trying to use technology ‚Äî in this case the wrong technology ‚Äî as a solution.

Steve Jennings/Getty Images (Reuters) - Facebook Inc's Chief Executive¬†Mark Zuckerberg¬†will sell 41.4 million shares worth about $2.3 billion as part of an offering of 70 million Class A common shares of the social network. Facebook shares were down 4 percent at $53.54 before the bell. Zuckerberg's sale will reduce his voting power to 56.1 percent from 58.8 percent, the company said in a filing on Thursday. Facebook said it expects Zuckerberg to use most of the net proceeds from the sale to satisfy taxes related to the exercise of an option to buy 60 million Class B shares. Each Class A share is entitled to one vote, while Class B shares are entitled to 10 votes and are convertible at any time into one Class A share. Board member Marc Andreessen will also sell 1.65 million Class A shares, while Facebook will sell 27 million. J.P. Morgan, BofA Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and Barclays are joint bookrunners for the offering. (Reporting by Sruthi Ramakrishnan in Bangalore; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)
BloombergYesterday the market was filled with fireworks as stocks exploded following the Fed's surprise "taper" announcement. Today, there's just a little bit of cooling off. US futures are pointing to a slightly lower open, though nothing dramatic. European stock markets are up solidly, as they're playing catch up from yesterday's big US gains. Today won't be as exciting as yesterday, but there are three interesting data points coming up later.
Investors brave enough to plough their cash into shares in Venezuela would have quintupled their money in 2013. The Caracas Stock Exchange, which lists just 15 Venezuelan shares, has returned a whopping 452pc in 2013, according to data firm Morningstar. But British investors have missed out on these stellar returns, as none of the 1,500-odd funds available to UK investors has a single penny in shares listed on the exchange. The strong stock market returns have come despite the anti-capitalist policies of the former president, Hugo Chavez, who died in March. Mr Chavez was not a fan of the private sector and during his 14-year reign regularly seized company assets. In turn this discouraged foreign investors from putting their money into companies in the South American region. But investors should be cautious about history repeating itself in 2014. The main reason for the Venezuelan stock market's strong performance has been the fear that the country is on the verge of a currency crisis, rather than investors warming to its new president, Nicol√°s Maduro. "Domestic investors are seeking to protect their bolivars from devaluation and inflation by buying the few stocks available on the local exchange ‚Äì pushing up prices," said Barclays Wealth. Venezuela‚Äôs government devalued the bolivar by 32pc in February. There are other surprises among the top 10 stock markets of 2013. A number of debt-ridden economies, such as Iceland and Greece, make the list, with rises of 38pc and 35pc respectively. Ireland, which suffered heavily during the financial crash but has been able to borrow on the open market again, also features, with its stock market returning 35pc. Elsewhere two frontier markets, Zambia and Nigeria, also make the list. Such markets have been touted as the next generation of emerging economies. Both nations have rapidly growing young populations, so in theory should benefit from the rise in domestic consumption, which should lead to more foreign investors putting money into their stock markets. Less of a surprise is to see Japan's Jasdaq index and America's technology-heavy Nasdaq exchange in the top 10. Country and stock market Rise in share prices in 2013 Venezuela ‚Äì Caracas Stock Exchange 452pc Japan ‚Äì Jasdaq index 51.1pc Iceland ‚Äì OMXI All Share 38.5pc Zambia ‚Äì Lusaka Stock Exchange 37.2pc Ireland ‚Äì Irish Stock Exchange 35.2pc Nigeria ‚Äì Nigerian Stock Exchange 34.9pc Greece ‚Äì Athens Exchange 34.5pc Argentina ‚Äì Mercado de Valores 33.9pc US ‚Äì Nasdaq index 33.7pc Pakistan ‚Äì Karachi Stock Exchange 31.8pc &gt;How British investors could have made money There are a number of investment funds which backed some of the best stock markets over the past 12 months, data from FE Trustnet shows. The data shows that Irish shares were popular, with a total of 246 funds having investments in the country. One fund with a big stake in Ireland is the Ignis European Smaller Companies fund, managed by Ian Ormiston. It has 15pc of its money in the country, some of it in Ryanair, the airline. "The financial crisis and the ‚ÄòIrish discount‚Äô created an opportunity to invest in long-term winners which will enjoy strong operational gearing [translation of rising sales into profits] as the recovery gathers pace," said Mr Ormiston. Nigerian shares were also in vogue with fund managers; around 20 emerging market and frontier market funds have investments there. The Charlemagne Magna Africa fund has 28pc in the country, while the JP Morgan Africa equity fund has 22pc. But for other regions that made the top 10, such as Greece, Iceland, Pakistan and Iceland, only a small minority of fund managers made profits from the strong stock market performances. One stock picker backing Greece is Barry Norris, manager of the Argonaut European Alpha fund. Mr Norris has bought shares in a number of Greek banks in recent months ; he thinks they could be one of the best investments over the next 12 months. "The best time to invest in a country is often when its economy is emerging from recession and all of the bad news is in the rear view mirror,‚Äù said Mr Norris. For the more established stock markets in the top 10 ‚Äì America and Japan ‚Äì fund investors have a much wider choice. However, the majority of such funds run by human stock pickers have struggled to beat the overall markets. Investors would have been better off with a "passive" or "tracker" fund, which merely aims to replicate the performance of a stock market as opposed to beating it. The average Japan fund has returned 25pc, undershooting the stock market's return of 51pc. The average performance of a US fund manager is 29pc, which fails to beat the Nasdaq index's return of 34pc. ‚Ä¢ Get Twitter alerts for all our investing stories: follow @telegraphinvest ‚Ä¢ More money predictions for 2014:Enter your email here to receive our weekly newsletter 
REUTERS/Chris HelgrenWe're still in the part of the year when the major Wall Street banks are releasing big previews and such for 2014.

Margin CallOkay so today probably won't have quite the same excitement as yesterday ‚Äî Fed day ‚Äî but we're jumping right back into learning more about how the U.S. economy is doing. From Calculated Risk, here are the three big data points coming out today: ‚Ä¢ At 8:30 AM, the¬†initial weekly unemployment claims report¬†will be released. The consensus is for claims to decrease to 337 thousand from 368 thousand last week.‚Ä¢ At 10:00 AM,¬†Existing Home Sales for November¬†from the National Association of Realtors (NAR). The consensus is for sales of 5.02 million on seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) basis. Sales in October were at a 5.12 million SAAR. Economist Tom Lawler is¬†forecasting¬†the NAR will report sales of 4.98 million SAAR in November.‚Ä¢ Also at 10:00 AM, the¬†Philly Fed manufacturing survey for December. The consensus is for a reading of 10.0, up from 6.5 last month (above zero indicates expansion). All three of these data points are fairly "top shelf" from our perspective, in that they tell us a lot and we pay close attention to them.
Gold just crashed. Kitco It's very close to falling to its lowest level of the year. It's not totally clear why gold just fell out of bed this morning. But overall this is a terrible environment for gold, as all the old stories about endless Fed printing and hyperinflation and political instability are coming to an end. Instead the Fed is pulling back on QE, the US government just passed a budget, and inflation remains low? Silver is also similarly tanking.
