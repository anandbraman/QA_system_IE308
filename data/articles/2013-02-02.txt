A nauseating whiff came from Barclays Friday, when it leaked out that it has been under investigation by the Financial Services Authority and the Serious Fraud Office in Britain for illegal fundraising in 2008. Allegedly, the bank secretly loaned ¬£5.3 billion ($8.4 billion) to one of Qatar‚Äôs sovereign wealth funds, which then turned around and with great public fanfare pumped that money back into Barclays‚Äîa scheme to raise capital on paper to escape a government takeover during the financial crisis. Then Cr√©dit Agricole, France‚Äôs third largest bank, announced ‚Ç¨3.8 billion ($5 billion) in write-downs, mostly of ‚ÄúGoodwill‚Äù due to the ‚Äúpresent macro-economic and financial environment.‚Äù Goodwill reflects money paid out for certain items in excess of their value‚Äîan expense that, by a quirk of accounting, is temporarily parked as an asset on the balance sheet to be expensed eventually. After the write-off, the bank will still have about ‚Ç¨14 billion of Goodwill clogging up its balance sheet, and more write-offs are to come. It already wrote off ‚Ç¨2.5 billion last year, when it agreed to sell its stake in the Greek bank Emporiki for ‚Ç¨1, which it had acquired with impeccable timing in 2006 for ‚Ç¨2.2 billion. Greek banks... oh my! They‚Äôre being investigated by Greek financial crime prosecutors for ‚Ç¨232 million in loans that they handed out to the ruling parties, Prime Minister Antonis Samaras‚Äô New Democracy and the Socialist PASOK. ‚ÄúSuspected crimes against the state,‚Äù a court official called it. The state funds political parties based on their share of the vote, and both parties pledged hoped-for state funding as collateral for these loans. But during the election last June, New Democracy‚Äôs share of the vote dropped from 33% to 29% and PASOK‚Äôs from 43% to 12%. With it, state funding suddenly collapsed, and some of the loans are turning sour. Bitter irony: teetering Greek banks, hoping at the time to get bailed out by taxpayers in other countries, funded Greek political parties that then negotiated the bank bailouts with the EU for the benefit of bank investors [likewise, Proton Bank got bailed out in 2011 though it engaged in fraud, embezzlement, and money laundering, when a bomb exploded.... European Bailout Fund For Greek Money Laundering And¬†Fraud] Still on Friday, SNS Reaal, fourth largest bank in the Netherlands, was bailed out again‚Äîafter already having been bailed out in 2008. This time, it was nationalized. The ‚Ç¨10 billion package would cost taxpayers initially ‚Ç¨3.7 billion. Stockholders and junior debt holders lost out too, but holders of senior debt and covered bonds were made whole. There is never an alternative to bailouts. A collapse ‚Äúwould have unacceptably large and undesirable consequences,‚Äù according to Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloemsaid. As brand-spanking new President of the Eurogroup, he thus confirmed: bank bailouts will be the norm in the Eurozone. They‚Äôre worried that letting even a smallish bank fail could take down the electron-thin confidence in the entire financial system‚Äîjust when the debt crisis has been officially declared ‚Äúover.‚Äù And so, based on the operative set of rules, the Dutch government shanghaied its strung-out taxpayers, whose belts are already being tightened by austerity, into paying, once again, for the misdeeds of the bankers. In Italy, a billowing scandal got new fuel. It kicked off with a criminal investigation into Monte dei Paschi di Siena, Italy‚Äôs third largest bank, for alleged market manipulation, false accounting, obstructing regulators, and fraud. The bank used derivatives to hide losses during the financial crisis, but these losses are now seeping from the woodwork. So Standard &amp; Poor‚Äôs just cut the bank‚Äôs credit rating, fearing that the announced losses may just be the tip of the iceberg. That form of financial engineering came to light when new management took a gander at the books. Now a government bailout is in the works. Because there is never an alternative. Taxpayers tighten your belts! And on Thursday, Deutsche Bank waded deeper into its quagmire of ‚Äúmatters,‚Äù among them the Libor rate-rigging scandal, which might cost it ‚Ç¨2.5 billion, and the carbon-trading tax-fraud scandal that broke with a televised raid by police on its headquarters. So, more write-downs are due, and the bank announced a ‚Ç¨2.2 billion loss for the fourth quarter. ‚ÄúIn 2013,‚Äù said co-CEO J√ºrgen Fitschen reassuringly, ‚Äúwe will be confronted with more developments in these and other matters.‚Äù And other matters! More revelations to come. Already, there are estimates that these misdeeds would eventually amount to ‚Ç¨10 billion. Now suddenly: ‚ÄúBuilding capital is our top priority,‚Äù said the other co-CEO Anshu Jain. He wants to do it without diluting current stockholders. ‚ÄúBut in this uncertain world, I cannot exclude anything,‚Äù he mollified his audience. Turns out, the bank intends to get rid of ‚Ç¨16 billion in high-risk credit default swaps by end of March. It might boost its core Tier 1 capital ratio from 8% to 8.5%. More such sales are planned‚Äîa wholesale dumping of its credit correlation book, an outgrowth of the financial engineering it used to hide whatever needed to be hidden. The bitter irony of the financial crisis is just how common the putrid smell has become since. And how routine it has become for these inscrutable institutions with their opaque financial statements to transfer risks and losses to the people. In the US, too, the smell refuses to evaporate. And nothing indicates that this will change anytime soon. Weary of all this, the French‚Äîwhose economy is spiraling deeper into crisis‚Äîexpressed disdain for their political class; they‚Äôre dreaming of authoritarian leadership, a ‚Äúreal leader‚Äù who would clean up the mess and ‚Äúreestablish order.‚Äù Read.... Could 87% of the French Really Want A Strongman To Reestablish¬†Order?
Life On The LineThe S&amp;P 500 futures contract is the most liquid equity index product in the world. ¬†The more liquid a product becomes, the more interest it attracts from outside people. ¬† This year's Super Bowl will be the most liquid sports betting event of the year with an estimated $10 billion being wagered globally. ¬†And the strategies and tactics used by both professional and amateur bettors are analogous to what we see on Wall Street everyday.¬† To gain insight into the inner workings of the sports betting market, Business Insider spoke with Ted Sevranksy (a.k.a. Teddy Covers), a well-known professional sports bettor and columnist for ESPN.¬† Here's what we've transcribed from our interview:¬† JL: How does a person become a professional sports bettor?¬† TC: That's a good question. The answer to how does a someone become a professional sports bettor is they start relying on sports betting for a large portion of their income. That's the bottom line. ¬†The only barrier to entry is being able to win enough to survive. But, obviously in order to be able to win enough to survive in the long term there's certainly some skill sets that you want to have. ¬†But for barriers to entry, there's none.¬† JL: How did you become a sports bettor? TC: Trial and error. ¬†I moved out to Las Vegas with some pretty poorly conceived notions about what it would take to be a professional sports bettor and luckily the first few years I was out here I was able to go through my growing pains without losing my entire bankroll. As any trader will tell you, learning how to trade can be an expensive process and learning how to bet can also be an expensive process obviously. ¬†My story was just a desire and ambition coupled with a long enough time frame to get my feet down on solid ground.¬† JL: Just generally to those growing pains you talked about can you highlight three or four of them that most sports bettors make and where they tend to fail and why you succeeded?¬† TC: One of the biggest lessons every sports bettor has to learn is he has to learn how to lose and how to accept losing and how to take a small loss, how to have a bad day. ¬†When you talk about the amateur stock pickers what do they do? Well, they hate to take a loss. ¬†They never want to take a loss. They end up taking a bath a lot of times. ¬†As a sports bettor, if you have a losing day and you can't handle it and you have to bet the late game and you double up on the late game and you double up for tomorrow and you can't concentrate on tomorrow's work and all the things that come with losing, you'll never survive. ¬†No chance. ¬†So I guess learning how to lose would be my No. 1 lesson.¬† JL: What process do you use when selecting winners. ¬†And is it analogous to investing in the markets? ¬† TC: There's two thought processes here. ¬†One is trying to beat the market and for a game like the Super Bowl, that's huge. It's a major factor. There are other situations where I'm not trying to beat the market where I'm trying to handicap the game and have a feeling on how the game is going to play out. ¬†There are two very different strategies or styles of betting and frankly you have to use both of them. I use both of them depending on the circumstance. So for a game like the Super Bowl, there's a huge element of making sure that when that line comes out you're ready to pounce and lock in on the number. ¬†You have to be able to read the direction the market is going to go and take advantage of the opportunity there. ¬† JL: ¬†When does that line come out and when do you have to be ready to pounce on it? (Note: a line is a point spread in the game) TC: The line for the Super Bowl came out in the fourth quarter of the Patriots/Ravens game when it was obvious that Baltimore was going to win¬†boom!¬†lines started popping up everywhere. ¬†Before the game's even done, before the championship games are even through, there are lines popping up for the Super Bowl and the market is starting to move. In this instance, the market gave us initially a false move because the first bets were on San Francisco and then it changed boom! the money started pouring in on Baltimore. ¬†It went from 5.5 to 5 to 4.5 to 4 and the next day all the 4s got taken out and it was mostly 3.5s out there. ¬†Now you say, 'Well a point to a half point, how much difference does it make?" One of the other things that I think professional sports bettors have to have is they have to have the ability to say, "Well I didn't get the best of the number, I didn't get close to the best of the number. I'm not going to beat the closing number with this particular wager." Guess what, it's not a great wager anymore. So in this instance, the opportunities that were there between 5.5 and 3.5, that's what five cents advantage in your pocket, six, seven cents of an advantage in your pocket if you can get a 5.5 instead of a 3.5. And obviously those little edges overtime are how you make your money.¬† JL: What are the differences and similarities to selecting the Super Bowl winner versus a regular NFL game?¬† TC: Well, it is a regular NFL game in a sense. ¬†The only difference is it has an enormous magnifying glass on it. So for something like the Super Bowl, you're not going to find information out there that other people don't have. ¬†You're not going to be able to take advantage of teams that people don't know players. It's very different from saying trying to bet college basketball because here the information is out there and it's widely available. ¬†The key is figuring out which information is important and that is certainly the case for the regular season in the NFL and for the Super Bowl that's even more paramount. People are going to quote all kinds of regular seasons statistics...all the metrics that sports bettors use to differentiate teams from one another. ¬†And in my mind, a lot of that stuff turns out to be fluff. And the real data is trying to analyze the coaching stats and trying to analyze the moves they're going to make with extra time to prepare. JL: Final question. ¬†Can you walk us through some of the investments you have in your Super Bowl portfolio?¬† TC: Yeah. Sure, I've got a ton. I bet some Baltimore early. ¬†I bet some more San Francisco late. So I have both sides there. I have a little bit of Ravens to win the game straight up. I expect to have more on San Francisco to win the game straight up although I don't have that in my portfolio yet. That's a thing that you want to wait until the weekend before you get involved with because that's when you get the best of the number in terms of the proposition wagers and that's what makes the Super Bowl such a unique animal. All the propositions wagers that are available and the opportunities that professional sports bettors have feasting against the public and public numbers. ¬†There's been a lot of under money on the Super Bowl--people betting total points under. But we didn't see the corresponding move with a lot of the player props. ¬†I've been looking to bet guys under. I bet Ray Rice, for example, with under 69.5, under 66.5 rushing yards in my portfolio. ¬†If I see something in the upper 50s before kickoff, maybe I bet back the other way. But in general there are a lot of unders in the player props I've been looking to get involved with. That's something I'll do as the public comes into town this weekend. Now check out Teddy Covers in this trailer for "Life On The Line," which premiered this weekend at LVH in Las Vegas: 
AP ImagesMajor Applewhite (left) and UT head coach Mack Brown.University of Texas offensive coordinator Major Applewhite and the school's athletic director released a joint statement on Friday night acknowledging that Applewhite had an "inappropriate" relationship with a student during the team's trip to the 2009 Fiesta Bowl. Beyond the cheating on his wife while she was apparently nine months pregnant*, the timing of this announcement raises a lot of questions for the University of Texas and how it handled the affair. Here is an excerpt from the statement from AD DeLoss Dodds (via CollegeFootballTalk): "Major Applewhite engaged in inappropriate, consensual behavior with an adult student one time during the 2009 Fiesta Bowl activities. After learning of his behavior later that month, I took immediate action to review the situation. We promptly initiated an inquiry with assistance from the universityís Legal Affairs office and other units outside of Athletics. Major admitted his inappropriate conduct and he was disciplined." But there are unanswered questions... Is Texas guilty of discrimination and a double-standard? Last month, Bev Kearney, the women's track coach at the University of Texas, resigned over an affair with "an adult student-athlete" in 2002. Was the African-American, gay, woman forced out over a consensual affair while the white male football coach (who was also a star football player at the school) received preferential treatment? In Applewhite's case, the affair was not with an athlete, but there may have still been a supervisory role. It will be interesting to see how Texas spins this. Why was this statement released now? Other than trying to bury the story late on a Friday night, Texas may also be trying to protect itself from a potential lawsuit from Kearney. If a lawsuit is coming, Kearney's legal team will want to show that male coaches were not forced out over similar circumstances. Is Mack Brown's job in jeopardy? The Texas football team has not played up to its own high standards in the last few years. It is not impossible to imagine that some within the program want to replace the 61-year-old coach, Mack Brown. If it was determined that Brown helped sweep this under the rug, Brown's job might not be able to survive this incident. While on the surface this sounds like a boring story about an assistant coach few people know, this story has the potential to explode into something much bigger. * Major Applewhite's daughter was born in January, 2009. The Fiesta Bowl occurred on January 5th. So there is a small chance the affair happened after the child was born.
It has come to this: Argentina has until November to change it's statistics on inflation and GDP or get kicked out of the International Monetary Fund. This story goes back to 2007, when late Argentine President Nestor Kirchner fired the statisticians in INDEC (the Argentine Bureau of Statistics) and replaced them. Since then the country has reported inflation numbers that differ wildly from those of independant analysts ‚Äî a difference of 10% versus 25% (check out some charts on that here). To keep up this charade, the government has fined statisticians that release numbers that contradict INDEC's. To current president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner's administration, these people are criminals. And the IMF is tired of this. At the end of last year the body's Executive Board discussed what they would do with the country. Last night they made an official decision. Argentina must change its ways or join Czechoslovakia as the only countries to ever be forced out of the IMF and lose the funding that comes with that. Argentina could also lose its status as a G20 country. Here's the release from the IMF: The IMF‚Äôs Executive Board met on February 1, 2013 to consider the Managing Director‚Äôs report on Argentina‚Äôs progress in implementing remedial measures to address the quality of the official data reported to the Fund for the Consumer Price Index for Greater Buenos Aires (CPI-GBA) and Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The Executive Board found that Argentina‚Äôs progress in implementing the remedial measures since the September 17, 2012 Board meeting (see Press Release No. 12/319) has not been sufficient. As a result, the Fund has issued a declaration of censure against Argentina in connection with its breach of obligation to the Fund under the Articles of Agreement. The Board called on Argentina to adopt the remedial measures to address the inaccuracy of CPI-GBA and GDP data without further delay, and in any event, no later than September 29, 2013. The measures applicable to the CPI-GBA and GDP aim at aligning these indicators with the international statistical understandings and guidelines that ensure accurate measurement. The Managing Director is required to report to the Executive Board by November 13, 2013 on the status of Argentina‚Äôs implementation of the above remedial measures. At that time, the Executive Board will again review this issue and Argentina‚Äôs response in line with IMF procedures. The Fund stands ready to continue its dialogue with the Argentine authorities to improve the quality of the official CPI-GBA and GDP data, and, more generally, to strengthen the relationship between Argentina and the Fund. The Kirchner administration is, as ever, defiant. They continue to insist that the IMF is out of line and released this communique in response to the ruling requesting a meeting with the IMF to discuss it¬†(Telam reports). ...Economy Minister Hern√°n Lorenzino said that the latest International Monetary Fund (IMF) criticism to Argentina¬¥s statistical system ‚Äúis a clear example of unequal treatment and of double standard‚Äù on the part of the monetary institution in its relationship with some of its member countries. The Argentine Government requested ‚Äúan extraordinary meeting of the Board of Governors of the IMF, to review its policy towards our country as well as its performance and responsibility in the world economic and financial crisis‚Äù, said the Ministry¬¥s communique√©. It also reminded that ‚ÄúArgentina is the same country that in the nineties, during the convertibility system, was presented by the IMF as the best example of an economic model, which wound up in the most serious institutional and economic crisis in the history of our nation‚Äù. "Such a stand regarding Argentina is not only an error on the part of the IMF, but also a clear example of an unequal treatment and double standard of this organism in its relationship with certain member countries. It is the same Fund that shows complacency towards inaccurate facts and policies that led to the global crisis. An IMF that despite being aware that its recipes do not work, does not repent from its prescriptions‚Äù, remarked the Ministry of Economy. Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner is not known for standing down. She is not known for changing her mind. She is not known for accepting the measures of international agencies that she considers harmful to her country's interest. Expect a fight.
Leroy W. Demery Jr.We recently brought you stunning photos of early-'80s Macau, before that city became a worldwide gambling mecca. Today, we want to show you a city whose transformation is perhaps even more incredible: Shenzhen, China. Shenzhen is one of the most unique cities in the world. In 1979, Premier†Deng Xiaoping named Shenzhen a Special Economic Zone, meaning it would be immune from the strict Communist regime governing the rest of the country and would instead would be permitted to pursue private enterprise. Shenzhen's official population was 12 million and it had a GDP of 500 billion RMB, according to the Asia Society. "Has any urban area on Earth ever grown so rapidly and changed so dramatically in such a short time as Shenzhen?"† That's the arguably rhetorical question posed by transportation expert and amateur photographer Leroy W. Demery Jr. in a photoset he has posted to flickr documenting his journey to the city in the 1980s. With his kind permission, we reproduce the photos here. Here is his own introduction: I traveled China for three months in 1983, and managed to visit, or "pass through," every province except Tibet, Hainan (part of Guangdong Province back then), Fujian and Taiwan (which I visited in 1980) †However, I made my "first visit" to China on 1980 July 17. I joined a half-day "cross-border" tour operated by China International Travel Service (CITS), Hong Kong. Booking was easy and the price was very reasonable. †Bao'an County, which had a settlement history dating back nearly 1,700 years, was renamed Shenzhen City in January 1979. At this time, the total population was stated at 300,000. The population of the urbanized area was stated at 20,000 - that's "twenty thousand" - and the urbanized land area was stated at 3 km2. Establishment of the Special Economic Zone was approved in August 1980 - that is, roughly one month after these photos were taken. I saw virtually no sign of the amazing changes that were soon to begin. †Travel guidebooks published during the early 1980s state that China began admitting unescorted foreigners in 1981. However, our Hong Kong-based CITS guide said that there was a "new arrangement:" one could obtain a visa to visit Beijing and Shanghai in three days. You simply applied for the visa, she said, "and on the third day, you go." So I might have visited (at least) Beijing and Shanghai in 1980, three years before I actually did.
Given Apple's commitment to secrecy, it's hard to get a good sense of what is going on inside the company. But in the opinion of one respected industry observer, Paul Kedrosky, some of Apple's recent missteps can tell us a lot about that. In an interview with Bloomberg West yesterday, Kedrosky said Apple's inability to meet demand for its new iMacs--a problem that contributed to disappointing Mac sales in Q4--as well as its cancellation of many iPhone component orders, mean that one of Apple's key competitive advantages may be disappearing. Kedrosky believes that Apple's iMac problems reveal an important change in the power balance within the company. Specifically, Kedrosky thinks that, in the power-vacuum following Steve Jobs' death, the design team, led by Jony Ive, have been given too much latitude--such that Apple is now designing products that it is not capable of manufacturing as smoothly and quickly as it needs to to meet demand. When Jobs was alive, Kedrosky implies, this "tension" between the design teams and manufacturing teams was in almost perfect balance. Jobs's brilliance as both a product designer and business executive kept the company from "over-designing" its products, or, just as bad, focusing so much on the numbers that its design standards sagged. And this balance, Kedrosky suggests, allowed Apple to continually out-design and out-produce the competition. But now that Jobs is gone, Kedrosky suggests, Jony Ive's design team has been given too much power--without a critical check and balance on whether Ive's products can actually be produced in the quantity and timeframe that Apple needs to produce them to meet demand. If Kedrosky is right, the irony is that the expertise of the man Jobs selected to succeed him--Tim Cook--is actually on the manufacturing side, not the design side. So, for Kedrosky to be right, Apple's CEO would have to be deferring too much to Ive, perhaps over his own best judgement. In any case, something has clearly gone wrong at Apple. And this is an interesting theory about what that is. Here's Kedrosky with Emily Chang of Bloomberg West: ¬†
In the first part of our interview with Paul Krugman, we discussed the standard topics of the deficit and the economy. In our second part, we discuss something more offbeat: The role of technology in the debate over inequality. This is a topic that Krugman has been writing a lot about lately, and he says that for a long time he missed a key part of this discussion. Whereas from about 1980 to 2000, the discussion about inequality was mostly seen as labor vs. labor (high-paid, high-skilled workers vs low-paid, low-skilled workers) the new story is about labor vs. capital, a topic that is more taboo. He notes that there have been periods before where workers went several decades without reaping the benefits of capital-favoring technologies (the industrial revolution), and it's possible that we're in a period like that now, which unfortunately means that easy answers like "skills training" won't necessarily help much. As for the specific technologies that he's intrigued by right now, he mentioned driverless cars and speech recognition, both of which use "big data" to accomplish something that we previously thought required human intelligence.

Max0rz / FlickrThe anti-gold bandwagon is getting more and more crowded. Analysts Tom Kendall and Ric Deverell of Credit Suisse is out with a bombshell report this morning titled: Gold: The Beginning Of The End Of An Era. The article argues that the 2011 peak of $1921 was the top, and that now the run of the cult metal is coming to an end. The argument essentially boils down to two arguments, which are related. The first is that we're seeing rate normalization. When real interest rates are ultra-low, gold does well historically. The second is that the era of crisis is over, and so the impulse to hedge against collapse (or massive volatility) is diminishing. Kendall and Deverell establish the argument over a series of charts. Big thanks to Credit Suisse for their permission to feature several charts from the report.

This week we were fortunate enough to have economist Paul Krugman in for a discussion on politics, the state of the economy, technology, and inequality. In this first section, I asked him if he thought the "deficit wars" were over... have the days of politicians trying to urgently enact spending cuts basically come to an end. "It looks like it," says Krugman. There are still some lingering issues, and there are still a lot of people who haven't dropped the rhetoric, but with the GOP caving on the debt ceiling, the big issues have mostly gone away. As for the economy, he sees the likely emergence of a "virtuous circle" forming, with more homes being built (because we're "underhoused"), home prices rising, people spending more, etc. One of the big fears these days in the market is that with this "virtuous circle" forming in the economy, that the Fed will tighten prematurely. Krugman isn't too worried about it. Bernanke gets it, and knows the Japanese experience of the central bank having taken away the punch bowl before the party even starts. Watch below.

This week's cover of Barron's is what all the contrarians will be talking about on Monday. "STOCK ALERT! GET READY FOR A RECORD ON THE DOW" Despite having a limited amount of statististically sound proof, the contrarians have been arguing that a bullish magazine cover is a sign of the top.† However, there have been plenty of bullish magazine covers during the last four years and stocks have only gone up.† On Friday, the Dow closed above 14,000 for the first time.† And it's only around 165 points from its all-time high. Barron's Andrew Bary toots Barron's horn to remind everyone that it's been bullish for a while:  BARRON'S HAS BEEN BULLISH ON STOCKS, including a cover story a year ago ("Enter the Bull," Feb. 13, 2012) in which we wrote that the Dow could hit 15,000 by the end of this year -- a target that looks increasingly achievable. Barron's was similarly upbeat in a cover story in the fall ("Almost There," Oct. 15, 2012). Bary re-presents the argument for Dow 15,000. Hubris?† History will tell.† For now, everyone will be downloading this image so they can be the first to write about it if the market makes a turn for the worse.

Sotheby'sG2 Partners managing director¬†John de Neufville turned two triplexes (purchased in 2002 for $2 million) into one massive bachelor's pad and sold it for $17.3 million, according to WSJ. Sure it was a great investment, but this place looks really hard to part with. It's huge but that's part of why de Neufville sold it ‚Äî because he thinks the house is too massive.  From he WSJ, "I didn't feel like I needed to live in a 7,000-square-foot house by myself," Mr. de Neufville said. That means he's said goodbye the hot tub on the roof, the huge gym, the wine-tasting room, 6 bedrooms, five full and two half bathrooms, two kitchens and six working fireplaces.

Soci√©t√© G√©n√©raleThe world is changing, and nowhere is that better illustrated than in a good series of charts. Luckily, we've seen no shortage of excellent charts this week that amply illustrate the changes underway. The best charts this week touch on everything from the "silent peak oil trade" to the sexiest currencies in the world. Now, let's go to the charts.
Gold prices may be impacted by a variety of factors like inflation, the dollar, fear, etc. But one of the most powerful factors driving prices is probably jewelry demand, which accounts for more than half of all gold demand. And jewelry demand has been booming thanks to rising wealth in the emerging markets, where gold offers cultural value. US Funds' Frank Holmes' recent gave a presentation at the World Money Show where he outlined his gold "love trade." One of his charts correlated gold prices with the rise of wealth in China and India. And the correlation is pretty tight.† Check out one of the straightest lines you'll see: US Funds
ECBIn July 2012, amid a backdrop of serious uncertainty over the future of the euro, ECB President Mario Draghi told the world that the central bank would "do whatever it takes" to save the currency. Prior to that point, the biggest open question was whether the ECB ñ which was seen as the only institution with the means to quell investor fears, yet was also perhaps legally or politically constrained from doing so ñ would step forward and put its weight behind a solution to the turmoil in European sovereign debt markets. Draghi's speech in July did just that. Since then, volatility has been crushed, high peripheral government bond yields that were seen as a threat to government stability have marched steadily lower as investors buy up Spanish and Italian debt, and stock markets have headed higher ñ after all, no one can find a reason to sell. In a note yesterday addressing eurozone bond markets, titled "Now We're Getting Worried," Morgan Stanley strategist Laurence Mutkin explained the fundamental shift in sentiment among eurozone investors like this (emphasis added): The "Whatever-It-Takes" speech created a seismic shift in market participantsí perceptions. Until then, each new obstacle provoked the question "will this break up the euro area?" Now, each obstacle raises the question "what steps will the authorities take to fix this?" Patrick Artus, Chief Economist of the French investment bank Natixis, says all of the faith investors have placed in Draghi is misguided. In a note, Artus compared the "Draghi put" that has emerged in financial markets since the speech in July to the "Greenspan put" U.S. investors began to count on in the 1990s, before the tech bubble burst at the end of that decade. The concept of the "Greenspan put" is simple: in the 1990s, investors began to think there was no risk to investing in risky assets because if markets really went sour, then-Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan would step in and provide ample monetary accommodation, averting a crash or a crisis. Everyone knows how that story ended ñ with the bursting of the dot-com bubble. Artus writes: The rise in all financial asset prices in the euro zone†(peripheral government in the euro zone bonds, European equities, bank bonds) is currently explained by the emergence of a "Draghi put." Investors are now convinced that thanks to the creation of the OMT, the ECB would react drastically and instantaneously to any event of rising interest rates and a recurrent crisis in the euro zone. Euro-zone assets are therefore deemed to be risk-free, thanks to the "Draghi put", despite the poor economic state of the euro zone excluding Germany: declining activity and investment, a fall in industrial production capacity†and therefore in supply capacity in the future, political and social risk due to the rise in unemployment, major problems in reducing fiscal deficits and stabilising public debt, rise in defaults and deterioration in the banksí solvency. Past experience shows that a central bank cannot prevent an asset price bubble from bursting, even by switching to a very expansionary monetary policy. Accordingly, there is no more effective "Draghi Put" today than there was an effective "Greenspan put" in 2000-2001. This is all the more true as: The comparison provides an interesting thought experiment for European investors, especially given how astounding and far-reaching the Draghi rally has been. The chart below shows the size of the Greenspan Fed's response to the bursting of the tech bubble in the context of its previous policy actions. When markets crashed, the Fed slashed interest rates:  What is perhaps most interesting is that the crash in markets at the end of the tech bubble was preceded by a phase where the Fed was tightening monetary policy by raising interest rates. Most consider recent developments in Europe ñ the ECB made clear in January that it is forgoing further rate cuts at this stage, and now banks are paying back loans to the ECB, which is also sending short-term rates higher ñ to amount to a de facto tightening. That's why Morgan Stanley's Mutkin says it will be crucial to observe Draghi's response to the upward move in rates since the last meeting. Meanwhile, it's probably good to keep in mind that markets have been in this situation before. READ MORE:†Morgan Stanley Is 'Getting Worried' About Europe Again &gt;
But despite the harvesting of additional productivity gains from the more recent revolution in information technology, the suite of macro data suggests that the rate of advancement in physical production has slowed, notably, in the past thirty years. Seen in this light, the greatest gains to global industrial production were probably enjoyed from the late 18th century (when coal extraction and use began in earnest) into the mid-20th century (when oil reached broad distribution). In contrast, computers, the Internet, and the leveraging of developing world labor might eventually be seen as the finishing touches on this great industrial wave. Indeed, the world now faces a double constraint to any further revolutionary gains to physical production: resource scarcity and the diminishing supply of the cheapest global labor, as wages in the Non-OECD have most likely seen their low. That we have reached this juncture probably explains why a new idea has arisen: The advent of robots. That fleets of more technically-proficient robots becoming ever more encompassing in their role in the economy will trigger the next Industrial Revolution, the one that does indeed deliver extraordinary productivity gains. The Rise of Machine Intelligence, it's now anticipated, will finally pull GDP back to the higher growth path seen in previous industrial advances. The past year has been a fertile time to consider this possibility. In March of 2012, Amazon.com bought the warehouse robot company, Kiva Systems. It seems not coincidental that Amazon has also engaged in a new wave of construction, building distribution centers poised to leap into an age of next-level automation. Each one, in its vastness and architecture, seems perfectly set up to reduce the quantity of human labor required to run Amazon's business. From The New York Times article: ‚ÄúAmazon has not had great margins,‚Äù Jason Helfstein, an analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Company. ‚ÄúOne has to believe they looked at this and thought, ‚ÄòWhy not just own it and take all the technology in house?‚Äô‚Äù The acquisition comes as Amazon aggressively adds distribution centers to service its growing consumer base. The company has heavily promoted its Prime service, which provides customers two-day shipping for $79 a year. Last year, Amazon said it planned to add 17 warehouses, bringing its total to 69. You can see the video of Kiva robots here, acting as automated shelf and inventory movers. Note also the remark from the Oppenheimer analyst, concerning Amazon's poor margins. (Well, that's not news). However, it's a key theme to the pressures fated to drive the rise of machine intelligence (Capitalism demands it). Accordingly, it's not surprising that even energy companies like ExxonMobil are thinking about the global shift to automated manufacturing, data centers, and, importantly to Exxon, the rise of electricity (I have been writing continually over the past year about the transition from a world running on liquid BTUs to a world running on power. Please see Rise of the Global PowerGrid, August 2012). In its just released Annual Energy Outlook, looking ahead to the year 2040, Exxon writes: One of the emerging drivers of demand globally relates to digital warehouses. The New York Times reports that on a worldwide basis, these data facilities use about 30 billion watts of electricity, roughly equivalent to the output of 30 nuclear power plants. Data centers in the United States are estimated to account for one-quarter to one-third of that load. 2012 was also a year in which military drones finally penetrated public awareness levels, given their widespread use by the military. WIRED magazine has declared that 2012 was the year of the drone in Afghanistan. Indeed, the military drone is increasingly carrying the weight not only of U.S. ground operations globally, but, assuming that the U.S. is in a leadership position now in the field of military drones, we can conclude that unmanned craft are creeping up to become a feature of U.S. foreign policy. Let's pause here and consider that in just these two examples. We have one type of robot ‚Äì the military drone ‚Äì whose greatest contribution is to radically reduce the amount of resources required to deliver lethal strike capability. And we have the other, whose promise is to displace human labor on the shop floor (or in Amazon‚Äôs case, the inventory floor). The replacement of human labor and its myriad, associated costs is revolutionary. The promise for robots to take energy input costs down a notch, at a time when the price level for energy has gone through a phase shift higher, is compelling. If we assume that the I.T. revolution so far has delivered only small, incremental gains to the production of physical goods, then a robot revolution could finally usher in the changes that critics correctly say has not yet been delivered by a world of bits. The combination of robots and cheap electricity could well unleash a new phase of profitability for corporations ‚Äì and, of course, the owners of the means of production. What‚Äôs less likely, however, is that any such revolution is sustainable. Because unlike the Industrial Revolution, which added powerful BTUs in the form of coal to augment human labor, thus creating a tidal wave of profits and increased wages, a robot revolution promises to furnish the world with stuff at the expense of human employment. Many thinkers currently writing on this subject believe that a labor force deprived even further of purchasing power, yet given greater access to cheap goods, will wind up richer on the whole. I won‚Äôt say that‚Äôs wrong, but I will say it seems unlikely. Let‚Äôs engage in a thought experiment, a scenario in which robots almost totally disrupt a particular type of consumer good. I‚Äôm choosing an example that I think would be most favorable to those who are sanguine about a robot-manufactured world, in which our wealth and free time are enhanced and people ‚Äúbecome liberated to engage in other activities.‚Äù Given the daily drudgery of cooking and meal preparation, let‚Äôs imagine that a company is able to take high-end cooking ranges, high-end cooking equipment, and high-end refrigerators and freezers, and deliver them to market at discounts up to 50% off current prices. There is already a cultural shift underway to eat home-prepared food. Arming consumers during a time of higher food costs with the very best tools to prepare and store food dovetails nicely with current trends and household cost pressures. White goods, such as these, are a substantial part of furnishing a home. By radically lowering the price of these high-end tools, the owners of private homes and also apartments are more easily able to buy, prepare, and freeze food, thus freeing up capital¬† (time) for other pursuits. Taking a look at the manufacturing locale, and input costs, of our hypothetical new company will be instructive. We'll call our new whiteware manufacturer Man Who Fell to Earth, Inc. (MWFE). Western economies burden corporations with complex labor regulations and even more onerous tax liabilities. The decision to place a human being on the payroll in France, Britain, or the United States is not taken lightly, and it represents a huge increase in costs for health care, taxes, and unemployment insurance. A person hired at a salary of $125,000 can imply total costs double that amount. This is why cheap labor in Asia has been such a draw for Western corporations. But now that China has reached the Lewis Turning Point, there is less reason to locate there. Instead, Man Who Fell to Earth (MWFE) needs to think about shipping costs and energy input costs, because robots run on electricity. As it turns out, the United States has some of the cheapest electricity rates in the OECD. Average U.S. rates are just below 10 cents per KWh, and are stable as well. Even better, industrial and commercial rates are even lower. From the most recent data, via EIA Washington:  Robots need no healthcare and incur no payroll taxes. Indeed, as machines, they would be conveniently depreciated like other capital equipment. Owing to U.S. hydropower and our cheap natural gas-fired powergrid, it's no longer clear that a factory making stoves, refrigerators, and cooking equipment with robots would be any cheaper in Asia. Indeed, current data suggests the price of electricity in China is roughly around 7.5 cents (or higher) per KWh. So, where might be a good locale for MWFE and its factory? Within the U.S., the cheapest electricity rates are in the Pacific Northwest. For the very same reasons that Amazon and Google have chosen The Dalles to site data centers, our Man Who Fell to Earth, Inc would find access to rail and river routes would set up the operation well, not only to receive raw materials but to ship to both North American and Pacific Markets. The Pacific Northwest is also the site of the largest smartgrid demonstration project in the U.S., operated by Battelle Labs and the Department of Energy. Microsoft and Yahoo have also chosen the Columbia River region to build enormous electricity-gulping data centers. Here is a photo of Google's complex in the Dalles:  As towns along the Columbia River and elsewhere in the Pacific Northwest have discovered, electricity-seeking data centers employ very few people. Google's data center cost over a half billion dollars to build, but employs at best 200 people. Facebook's data center in Prineville, OR employs only 55. Once the construction phase is over, Man Who Fell to Earth, Inc (MWFE) becomes an operation also employing few human workers. Mostly, MWFE would engage in consumer marketing and would concern itself with the futures market for finished steel, copper, and other commodities. MWFE strikes long-term shipping agreements with railroad companies and it monitors quality control mostly through remote instrumentation. Its only need for humans is to manage relationships with raw material providers and to liaise with the robot manufacturers for maintenance and upgrades. It‚Äôs probably the case that MWFE is robot-staffed by an array of 3-D printers and various free-ranging robots. It‚Äôs probably also the case that the initial up-front investment is enormous, but while there are still the usual uncertainties about the economics of the operation itself, the company has taken the volatility of ongoing labor costs down to very low levels. More and U.S. manufacturers are already making the choice to invest in 'intelligent machines' to guide robot production lines. Adam Davidson's excellent piece on this subject on last year's Atlantic, Making It in America, charts the course of automation as the U.S. competes against cheap developing-world labor through the use of advanced machines. Of course, this means that the U.S. economy holds some moderate ground in terms of output. But it also means that demand for human labor collapses further: Yet the success of American manufacturers has come at a cost. Factories have replaced millions of workers with machines. Even if you know the rough outline of this story, looking at the Bureau of Labor Statistics data is still shocking. A historical chart of U.S. manufacturing employment shows steady growth from the end of the Depression until the early 1980s, when the number of jobs drops a little. Then things stay largely flat until about 1999. After that, the numbers simply collapse. In the 10 years ending in 2009, factories shed workers so fast that they erased almost all the gains of the previous 70 years; roughly one out of every three manufacturing jobs ‚Äì about 6 million in total ‚Äì disappeared. There is nothing our robot manufacturing company can do to lower the price of steel, copper, rubber, and chemicals. Likewise, it‚Äôs beholden as well to the robot and 3-D machine manufacturers. It still has to negotiate with transport companies, who themselves, in the case of the railroads, enjoy monopoly pricing. But MWFE has escaped the high cost of maintaining a human workforce and is passing on those savings to consumers. But what happens to the economy should this trend broaden? During the past 30 years, Americans have been treated to a flood of cheap goods and outright deflation in most foreign manufactured items. Did this make us wealthier? Because that is the standard position of many economists. The developed world has learned over the past decade that a steady supply of cheaper, foreign-made goods does not guarantee prosperity. What impact will (perhaps only moderately) cheaper goods have if coupled with reduced employment as human labor is displaced by machines? If we are unable to find a higher use for the displaced human labor, we are actually worse off. In Part II: Why the Robot Age May Create a Massive Deflationary Bust, we take a look at why the end of cheap energy will drive the economics of machine intelligence, as global capitalism desperately seeks its next revolution. The efficiencies promised by robots and other intelligent machines are real and will play a critical role in our industrial future. But their hidden risks to society are high and must be addressed early on in order to enter into the 'robot age' without triggering radical levels of inequality. For if we don't, we may well find that the solution is worse than the problem we've designed it for.

The Conference Board publishes a monthly "help wanted" index which tracks the number of Total Online Help Wanted Ads and the Number of New Ads.† The data for this series currently†goes back to 2005 after revisions to the index were made.† (The original data series which†tracked "help wanted ads" in newspapers was discontinued after the revisions but that data series goes back to 1951.)††In the January release of the help wanted index the number of online help wanted ads increased to 5,044,673 from 4,937,764 in December.† The number of new ads, however, dropped to 2,915,271 from 3,115,192.† In order to use the older discontinued data, for a longer term historical perspective, I converted the new data to a composite index using the percentage change in the number of†new help wanted ads.† I then set May 2005, the starting month of new index, to 38.† When combined with the older historical data it produced the following chart.  While it is clear that the index declines as the economy heads into recessions -†it doesn't really give us many clues about the present situation regarding employment, jobless claims or the economy.† What we can tell from this chart is that since the end of the last recession the hunt for employees has remained relatively weak as compared to previous post-recession recoveries.† Of course, this goes hand-in-hand with an economy that is still running at sub-par growth rates during the same period of time and being primarily supported by continued interventions from the Federal Reserve.† If we take the same chart and compare it to total non-farm employees a clearer picture emerges.† As shown in the chart below the ebb and flow of the help wanted index correlates highly with the level of total non-farm payrolls.† The recent stagnation in payrolls is consistent with the stagnation of the demand by employers issuing "help wanted" ads.† Historically, such stagnation has been indicative of peaks in the employment cycle.† This is†a very real "fly in the ointment" of those expecting a resurgence of economic activity in the months ahead. Not surprisingly there is also a high correlation between the help wanted index and jobless claims.† As†shown below†the bottom in†help wanted ads generally corresponds very closely with†peaks in jobless claims. †  The help wanted index was rising in November and December which corresponded with the sharp drop in claims as temporary seasonal hires needed for the holiday shopping season pulled people out of unemployment lines.† However, the drop in January, as seasonal hires are terminated, is supportive of the surge in claims in the most recent January claims report. Naturally, since it is ultimately the strength of the overall economy that encourages hiring, thereby reducing jobless claims, there is also a high correlation between the help wanted index and GDP.  With the most recent print in GDP showed no growth, and the trend of growth in GDP over the last year decidedly negative, the stagnation of the help wanted index may be sending a cautionary signal.† There are many hopes that the rest of this year will reverse the sub-par economic growth rate witnessed over the last four years, however, there is little evidence currently that will be case.† The current macro-economic environment is still being supported by artificially suppressed interest rates and massive amounts of liquidity.† These artificial supports erode economic strength over time as incomes and confidence are negatively impacted.† It will likely be very beneficial to pay attention to the help wanted index for clues as to the direction and strength of employment, claims and the economy in the months to come. †Currently it is looks a lot like we may be building a peak for this recovery cycle.
