In the latest Bedtime with BTIG note, strategist Dan Greenhaus passes along this chart of various markets and how they've performed year-to-date. BTIG One thing that really stands out is how bad the performance has been from the BRICs. The two worst on here are Brazil and Russia. China and India are barely in positive territory. Overall emerging markets are down. The winners are the real old-timers: U.K., Japan, and of course the U.S., with Europe closely behind. A big part of the story this year has been the weakness in commodity prices, which is toxic for countries like Brazil, Mexico, and Russia. China of course has its own issues, and has had a sick stock market for a while.

Flickr / Mick_tnOnce again, Friday ended with the stock market climbing to new all-time highs. Even with last week's massive dump of lackluster economic data, volatility remained almost startlingly low. It's worth noting that it's been a while since anyone has said anything about a debt crisis.Â  Europe is cooling off and the U.S. is watching it's budget deficits improve. This coming week will be relatively light for data. Perhaps, this will give experts some time to ponder the current risks to the markets and the economy. Two big concerns of late are the rising risk of deflation and the stagnating earnings growth expectations. We will discuss each a bit more. Top Stories Economic Calendar Market Update Analysts are quick to note that despite record high stock prices, earnings are also at record highs, which makes valuations much more reasonable than they were during the highs of 2000 and 2007. However, earnings growth expectations have stagnated. "I am troubled to see that forward earnings has been stuck around its record high of $115 for the past nine weeks," wrote market guru Ed Yardeni earlier this week. "This is the measure of earnings that I believe drives the market." Hedge fund manager Felix Zulauf shares Yardeni's concern. "The problem with currently rising equity markets is not rising prices but the lack of fundamental improvement," wrote Zulauf for Itau BBA.Â  "Once equity markets discover the emperor has no clothes, they could face a quick and painful adjustment to bring markets in line again with fundamentals."
The can't-lose market continues. Japan up another 1% to start the week. Nikkei.com The real big news though to start the week is the hard selloff in silver, as the pain continues for the precious metal bugs.
It's shaping up to be another rough day for fans of precious metals, especially silver. More broadly, silver and gold have been getting poleaxed in recent weeks and months. How come? Sam Ro earlier posted a chart from Credit Suisse, which explains that there are two driving factors. One is that the fear of Armageddon is fading (which they express by showing declining sovereign debt yields in Spain and Italy). The other is that interest rates are normalizing, and coming out of their ultra-low crisis level. Ultra-low interest rates diminish the appeal of holding currency, and boost the appeal of gold. Reverse that, and the appeal of gold goes away. Those two charts explain it all: Credit Suisse
Getty Images/ Mark Wilson Â As you read, shareholders of JP Morgan are deciding if CEO Jamie Dimon will keep his job as he knows it. Dimon, widely considered the most powerful banker in the country, holds the positions of both CEO and chairman of JP Morgan's board. It's the largest bank in the U.S., and complaints from regulators, and the sting of a $6 billion trading loss last year have given more ammunition to those who've asked for some time now â€” is JP Morgan too big to manage? The specific question at hand is whether or not one man, even one with Dimon's talent, can be both the CEO and the chairman of the board that is supposed to judge the CEO's performance for shareholders. At last year's meeting, 40% of shareholders answered "no" to that question. This year it looks like there will be more.Â Proxy advisors,Â Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis, have advised JP Morgan shareholders to vote in favor of splitting the two roles. As bold as ever, Dimon has said that if that happens, he will leave the bank entirely. He will have it all or nothing â€” and he's fighting hard for the former.Â Last week, The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (an organization of which JP Morgan is a part) asked Broadridge, the company tallying incoming shareholder votes, toÂ stop sharing the results with Dimon's detractors. Seeing the votes as they come in, would, after all, give the board and Dimon a significant advantage.Â This is a spin game, where getting the right message to the right people is everything. With voting information, the board will know who to target and how. As of Friday, endowments and pensions filed with the SEC to review the rules for shareholder voting to see if a move like this is even legal,Â according to Reuters.Â  From Reuters: Michael Garland, who oversees corporate governance for New York City Comptroller John Liu, one of the fund investors behind the proposal, said May 6 was the last time he learned from Broadridge how the voting was going. "It is hard to know what kind of strategy to pursue and what kind of resources to invest," Garland said. But it may be too late in the game for that to make a difference.Â For the last week the financial media has sounded like this â€” CEOs (and former CEOs) of all shapes and sizes sounding off about how great Dimon is at his job. Some say his detractors are just jealous, others say he's the best manager in the world and that JP Morgan would be sunk without his leadership, etc. Those comments make for decent headlines, but they don't erase the fact that, as Businessweek pointed out, the litigation section of JP Morgan's quarterly reports runs to 18 single-spaced pages.Â  Additionally, they do not change the fact that Washington has made it clear that it is growing tired of hearing of misbehavior coming from the House of Dimon â€” in energy trading, or with Bernie Madoff's accounts, for example. Regardless, JP Morgan bankers seem completely unworried about who will be captaining their ship in the coming years. It will be Jamie, and in their view he doesn't need a boss. There is no succession plan for his departure in the event of disaster either, as Reuters' Felix Salmon pointed out. But the view from inside JP Morgan is that there doesn't need to be one. Dimons are forever.
Fans of precious metals have been getting creamed lately. Thanks to declining volatility and a growing sense that real interest rates are on the rise, gold and silver have been getting taken to the woodshed. And in early Asian trading there's no letup. Silver is getting demolished. From Kitco, here's the sharp downward spike. Kitco As you can see here, the decline in gold is more muted, but still visible. Silver's not the only thing going wild. The yen â€” which everyone is watching â€” has been jumping around in early going, with it sharpening notably right at the open, before weakening again. Meanwhile, fans of the precious metals are likely to point to various excuses for the bad price action. The latest talk is that it has something to do with ETF liquidations, and big mysterious trades that happened on Friday.
Bank Of America Merrill LynchFrom Dan Suzuki's study.On Friday, Bank Of America Merrill Lynch and Deutsche Bank independently published their respective findings on corporate profit margins, which are currently sitting at historic highs. "The debate on S&amp;P 500 net margins never seems to go away," wrote Deutsche Bank's David Bianco. "One of the most common bearish arguments that we hear from clients is that margins are mean-reverting," wrote Bank of America Merrill Lynch's Dan Suzuki. Both Bianco and Suzuki concluded that margins were sustainable and were unlikely to collapse to historic means. This refutes the work of John Hussman and GMO's Jeremy Grantham, both who have warned that falling margins would crush profits and hinder the long-term returns on stocks. It's All About Low Interest Expense And Low Tax Rates On Saturday, we discussed the findings of Suzuki. "Importantly, roughly two-thirds of the improvement in net margins can be attributed to changes below the operating line, specifically interest expense and taxes," noted Suzuki regarding the increase in margins since 1995.Â  Suzuki went on to argue why interest expense and taxes were unlikely to rise anytime soon. Deutsche BankFrom David Bianco's study.Like Suzuki, Deutsche Bank's David Bianco also decomposed gains in profit margins since 1995.Â  While Bianco's numbers are slightly different, his conclusions were essentially the same. "Net margins are higher from structural factors... not cost cutting," said Bianco. So What Are The Bears Getting Wrong? Margin bears have been emphasizing how companies have improved profitability by laying off workers and squeezing the workers who they kept. The bears' thesis has been supported by the persistently high unemployment rate and stagnant wage growth. But the findings of Bianco and Suzuki show that that the bears' concerns are relatively small and more than offset by gains the forces of lower interest expense and taxes. To get a better sense of this debunking, you need to look at operating margins, which are profits before interest and tax. Bianco and Suzuki examined operating margins from different angles but nevertheless arrived at similar conclusions. Tech And Energy Operating Margins "S&amp;P 500 Non-Financial operating margins are currently about 12.0% vs. their historical average of 10.6%," writes Suzuki.Â  "This is entirely due to increases in profitability and contribution from Tech and Energy." Suzuki notes that tech and energy operating margins have undergone significant structural changes. Tech sector margins have benefitted from industry maturation. You see, young tech industries operate at losses or very slim margins as they get their companies off of the ground.Â  Today, the once young tech companies have established themselves and built up the scale to maintain a higher level of profitability. Energy is benefiting from massive structural changes.Â  Back in the 80's and 90's, oil prices were at around $20/barrel.Â  But thanks to emerging market demand, oil is trading around $90/barrel today. And oil prices and energy industry margins are very tightly correlated. Suzuki says that oil would have to plunge back to around $30 for margins to revert to a mean. This is unlikely. "Excluding these sectors, operating margins of 11% are only 65bp above their historical average," said Suzuki.Â  "While we agree that both earnings and margins are cyclically elevated, operating margins appear in-line with historical non-recessionary periods (Chart 12)." As you can see from the chart below, there's nothing spectacular about operating margins today. Bank Of America Merrill LynchThere's nothing that look unsustainable in this chart. Â Foreign Exposure Another way to look at operating margins is by geography.Â  Bianco does a nice job of this in his devastating 18-page report. Keep in mind that it tends to be cheaper to operate overseas thanks to stuff like low labor costs and property expenses. Deutsche Bank"Since 2000 in aggregate S&amp;P foreign pre-tax margins have been higher than pretax domestic margins and gap is widening," wrote Bianco. "This is because â€“ 1) high margin businesses are the ones that are expanding abroad; and 2) their foreign operations became more profitable in the 2000s after the mostly investment stage of the 1990s. As companies with high foreign sales are becoming a larger share of the S&amp;P, aggregate foreign operating margins are climbing." And we can't forget about taxes.Â  It's well known that corporate tax rates are lower overseas.Â  So the more companies expand out there, the lower their effective tax rates become. Deutsche BankDomestic net margins aren't troublingly high.Bianco provides another eye-opening chart aggregating the net margins of companies with high foreign sales and those with no foreign sales. As you can see from his sample, the profit margins of U.S. companies selling to U.S. customers doesn't seem to be anywhere close to a level that would warrant a collapse. Conclusion Neither Bianco nor Suzuki will deny that profit margins are high and are at risk of pulling back. However, they both aim to make clear that profit margins are high due to long-term structural factors, not short-term cyclical factors. It appears both have accomplished this very convincingly.
 Shinichi MochizukiEarlier today we wrote about the intriguing new claim, from computer industry pioneer Ted Nelson, that the inventor of Bitcoin was probably Japanese math professor Shinichi Mochizuki. Mochizuki made a name for himself last fall when he cracked the infamous ABC Conjecture, which dealt with the nature of prime numbers. Nelson's argument, which he laid out in a video, is that Mochizuki showed a level of intelligence and breadth of knowledge that was similar to the pseudonymous Bitcoin creator, who went by the name Satoshi Nakamoto. Nelson pointed out that like Nakamoto, (who introduced Bitcoin to the world and then disappeared without a trace) Mochizuki did much the same thing after his famous proof last year. But some are skeptical. In a comment posted on YCombinator which he has let us publish, Clark Minor explains the problem with the theory that Nakamoto is Mochizuki: This is almost certainly wrong. If you spend any time at all reading about history of Bitcoin and other related currencies, it's clear that Satoshi was a cypherpunk. And at least an active lurker, if not a well-known participant, in the cypherpunks mailing list during the 1990s and early 2000s. Just look at the sources in the bitcoin paper. Satoshi cites lots of cypherpunks, and not many mainstream academics. The code borrows time-stamping ideas from Usenet and takes inspiration from command-and-control architectures of IRC botnets. The pieces of the puzzle are: - (1997) Adam Back's hashcash proof of work system - (1998) Wei Dai's b-money - (1998-2005) Nick Szabo's writings about git gold - (2004) Hal Finney's reusable proof of work (RPOW) Satoshi brought these ideas -- cypherpunk ideas -- together to make Bitcoin, not the ideas about improving Chaumian blind signatures and anonymous e-cash that were being discussed in the academic crypto literature of the time. Remember, cypherpunks (and others inspired by Tim May's crypto-anarchy) have a long history of communicating anonymously. Anonymous remailers and pseudonyms were expected on the list, so it's not unusual to see Satoshi Nakamoto come out of this tradition. There are probably people that know who the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, but they're not going to tell. They're cypherpunks, after all. And if Satoshi stays anonymous, it just means that everything is going exactly as planned. Meanwhile, Nelson has promised to donate one Bitcoin to charity if Mochizuki will come out and say he's not the Bitcoin inventor.
REUTERS/KyodoJapan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe poses inside a cockpit of T-4 training jet plane of the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF)'s Blue Impulse flight team at the JASDF base in Higashimatsushima, Miyagi prefecture, in this photo taken by Kyodo May 12, 2013.WHEN Shinzo Abe resigned after just a year as prime minister, in September 2007, he was derided by voters, broken by chronic illness, and dogged by the ineptitude that has been the bane of so many recent Japanese leaders. Today, not yet five months into his second term, Mr Abe seems to be a new man. He has put Japan on a regime of “Abenomics”, a mix of reflation, government spending and a growth strategy designed to jolt the economy out of the suspended animation that has gripped it for more than two decades. He has supercharged Japan’s once-fearsome bureaucracy to make government vigorous again. And, with his own health revived, he has sketched out a programme of geopolitical rebranding and constitutional change that is meant to return Japan to what Mr Abe thinks is its rightful place as a world power. Mr Abe is electrifying a nation that had lost faith in its political class. Since he was elected, the stockmarket has risen by 55%. Consumer spending pushed up growth in the first quarter to an annualised 3.5%. Mr Abe has an approval rating of over 70% (compared with around 30% at the end of his first term). His Liberal Democratic Party is poised to triumph in elections for the upper house of the Diet in July. With a majority in both chambers he should be able to pass legislation freely. Mr Abe is not the first politician to promise to revitalise his country—the land of the rising sun has seen more than its share of false dawns—and the new-model Abe still has everything to prove. Yet if his plans are even half successful, he will surely be counted as a great prime minister. The reason for thinking this time might be different is China. Economic decline took on a new reality in Japan when China elbowed Japan aside in 2010 to become the world’s second-largest economy. As China has gained confidence, it has begun to throw its weight around in its coastal waters and with Japan directly over the disputed Senkaku/Diaoyu islands. Earlier this month China’s official People’s Daily even questioned Japanese sovereignty over Okinawa. Mr Abe believes that meeting China’s challenge means shaking off the apathy and passivity that have held Japan in thrall for so long. To explain the sheer ambition of his design, his people invoke the Meiji slogan fukoku kyohei: “enrich the country, strengthen the army”. Only a wealthy Japan can afford to defend itself. Only if it can defend itself will it be able to stand up to China—and, equally, avoid becoming a vassal of its chief ally, the United States. Abenomics, with its fiscal stimulus and monetary easing, sounds as if it is an economic doctrine; in reality it is at least as much about national security. Perhaps that is why Mr Abe has governed with such urgency. Within his first weeks he had announced extra government spending worth ¥10.3 trillion (about $100 billion). He has appointed a new governor of the Bank of Japan who has vowed to pump ever more money into the financial system. In so far as this leads to a weaker yen, it will boost exports. If it banishes the spectre of deflation, it may also boost consumption. But printing money can achieve only so much and, with a gross debt of 240% of GDP, there is a limit to how much new government spending Japan can afford. To change the economy’s long-run potential, therefore, Mr Abe must carry through the third, structural, part of his plan. So far, he has set up five committees charged with instigating deep supply-side reforms. In February he surprised even his supporters by signing Japan up to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a regional trade agreement that promises to force open protected industries like farming. Nobody could object to a more prosperous Japan that would be a source of global demand. A patriotic Japan that had converted its “self-defence forces” into a standing army just like any other country’s would add to the security of North-East Asia. And yet those who remember Mr Abe’s first disastrous term in office are left with two worries. The danger with the economy is that he goes soft, as he did before. Already there are whispers that, if second-quarter growth is poor, he will postpone the first of two consumption-tax increases due in 2014-15 for fear of strangling the recovery. Yet a delay would leave Japan without a medium-term plan for limiting its debt and signal Mr Abe’s unwillingness to face up to tough choices. The fear is that he will bow to the lobbies that resist reform. Agriculture, pharmaceuticals and electricity are only some of the industries that need to be exposed to competition. Mr Abe must not shrink from confronting them, even though that means taking on parts of his own party. The danger abroad is that he takes too hard a line, confusing national pride with a destructive and backward-looking nationalism. He belongs to a minority that has come to see Japan’s post-war tutelage under America as a humiliation. His supporters insist he has learned that minimising Japan’s wartime guilt is unacceptable. And yet he has already stirred up ill will with China and South Korea by asking whether imperial Japan (for which his grandfather helped run occupied Manchuria) really was an aggressor, and by allowing his deputy to visit the Yasukuni shrine, where high-ranking war criminals are honoured among Japan’s war dead. Besides, Mr Abe also seems to want more than the standing army Japan now needs and deserves. The talk is of an overhaul of the liberal parts of the constitution, unchanged since it was handed down by America in 1947, Mr Abe risks feeding regional rivalries, which could weaken economic growth by threatening trade. Mr Abe is right to want to awaken Japan. After the upper-house elections, he will have a real chance to do so. The way to restore Japan is to focus on reinvigorating the economy, not to end up in a needless war with China.
YouTubePlanet of the Apes (1968)Ric Deverell is convinced the sell-off in gold is far from over. On Thursday, Deverell -- Credit Suisse's Global Head of Commodities -- told reporters in London that the yellow metal was heading to $1,100 this year and to $1.000 within five years. He made those comments during Credit Suisse's 5th annual commodities day in London. He also circulated a 41-slide presentation on commodities titled "The Setting Of The Sun."  It included 5 slides dedicated to his bleak outlook for gold. "Gold has been the only trending asset for the past ten years, but the trend has broken," wrote Deverell noting that the recent sell-off has been a highly unusual 3 standard deviation event. "Despite recent falls the price still appears excessive," he added noting that gold continues to be priced well above its long run average. Even relative to other metals, gold appears to be significantly overvalued. However, it was this last slide that was arguably the most important (and most hilarious). You see, gold bugs have argued that the global debt crisis would continue to flair up and central bank monetary policy would cause inflation to run rampant. But both of those concerns have receded. Deverell uses the analogy "Planet of The Apes Risk" to illustrate the risk of financial and societal meltdown. This is something that could happen in Europe if the euro broke up. For now, the euro is holding together.  And humans have not been displaced by apes. Credit Suisse
REUTERS/Yuri GripasSurveying the latest stock transactions of billionaire George Soros, observers would have to surmise tech stocks are in and financial stocks — not to mention some industrials — are out. Soros went even bigger on Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and bought into Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD), according to filings detailing his fund’s activity. Soros’s buying and selling activity is always of note, and he proved yet again he’s into Google for the long term. For a stock that continues growing, Google has the distinct advantage in that employees believe the company is going to continue innovating. Google topped the lit of companies with the “Best Business Outlook in the Next 6 Months,” a survey taken by Glassdoor.com. Perhaps not coindientally, Qualcomm came in second on the same list. The introduction of LinkedIn and Netflix to the Soros portfolio marks a substantial increase in the billionaire’s tech holdings. All told, the technology sector constitutes over 16 percent of Soros’s portfolio while the number of financial services stocks slipped to just 2.3 percent. The Soros fund sold holdings in Citigroup (NYSE:C) and AIG (NYSE:AIG), along with its entire holdings of General Motors (NYSE:GM). Soros proved he’s not finished with the manufacturing sector, as he bought shares of Boeing (NYSE:BA) for the first time. The company’s recent maneuvering through the Dreamliner problems — not to mention its increased production pace — have been attracting investors from all sides. Soros is on board with a company that has its aircraft production schedule booked until nearly the end of the decade and has only one major competitor worldwide. Viking Global recently bought over 12 million shares of Boeing. Surveying Soros’s other notable buys, LinkedIn has continued its run as the best performing social media stock. In contrast to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), LinkedIn has found a way to grow revenue without total dependence on advertising. The company survived the recession and its job-centric focus, and now LinkedIn could be the vehicle for job seekers to upgrade positions as they grow comfortable with the site.

REUTERS/Alessandro BianchiROME (Reuters) - Rafa Nadal made short work of his great rival Roger Federer to win the Italian Open, his sixth trophy of the year, 6-1 6-3 on Sunday. The crowd sitting in the sunshine at Rome's Foro Italico watched Nadal race to victory in 69 minutes on the red clay. The Spaniard, back in his best form after last year's long injury layoff, spent less time on court than Serena Williams who won her fourth consecutive tour title when she thrashed former world number one Victoria Azarenka 6-1 6-3 to take the women's title earlier on Sunday. Nadal, seeded fifth, dominated the first set, winning 20 of 25 points at one stage, as the Swiss second seed produced a string of unforced errors. Federer raised his game in the second set, breaking a nine-game losing streak to go 1-3, but Nadal was in no mood to slow down. Despite being broken as he served for the match at 5-1, Nadal went on to complete his 36th win in 38 matches this year. "It's a very important day, a very happy day for me after a difficult year last year," Nadal, speaking in Italian, told the crowd after the trophy presentation. "It is really emotional for me to win a tournament with such a long history as Rome. See you next year." REUTERS/Alessandro BianchiNadal, 11 times a grand-slam winner, was sidelined for seven months with a knee problem and said he was delighted to be back in form. "I am just enjoying the moment and valuing it more than ever because I know where we were just a few months ago," he said. "Being here a few months later with all I have achieved is really more than a dream." American Williams, who has not lost a match since Azarenka defeated her in the Doha final in February, completely overpowered the Belarussian in the women's final. The top-seeded Williams, 31, hit nine aces and 41 winners in the two sets, taking 93 minutes for victory. Her win, 11 years after she won her only previous Rome title, follows successes in Miami, Charleston and Madrid and will give her confidence for the French Open which starts next weekend. "It wasn't easy, nothing is ever easy," Williams said. "Last year I was feeling excellent on clay but didn't do that great at Roland Garros; this year I'm cautious and I want to work hard and stay focused and win every point I play, and not slack at all." Williams admitted that she would, however, allow herself one deviation from her usually strict training diet - an Italian ice cream. "This is what I was waiting for," she said. "I'll have pistachio - it's the only one I get." (Additional reporting by Iain Rogers in Madrid; Writing by Clare Fallon; Editing by Justin Palmer and Toby Davis)

REUTERS/Ilya NaymushinGold went down the toilet again on Friday, and is now close to revisiting its April lows. This gold weakness is causing a lot of consternation to fans of it who don't understand how the precious metal can keep falling, when central banks around the world continue to press down on the gas pedal. A lot of gold bugs think the price is being manipulated somehow, or that there's some divergence between what's going on in "paper" gold (gold prices that are tied to ETFs) and what's going on in physical gold (people buying ingots or jewelery) Randall W. Forsyth at Barron's fans the flames of goldbug conspiracy theorists a bit this weekend, arguing that there have been suspicious sales in gold seen on the exchanges (probably driven by the ETFs). He writes: These improbable moves have made gold bugs suspicious, which isn't unusual. Folks who own gold do so because they don't trust the status quo, especially when it comes to government-issued paper money. But just because you're paranoid doesn't mean somebody isn't out to get you. They point to bursts of selling on Friday, April 12, which resulted in prices plunging by more than 5%, and to dumping that resumed the following Monday in Asia, early in the day when markets are illiquid. That culminated in a 9% collapse by the time the New York market had settled. But a seller who wanted to unload a large position at the optimal price would have done precisely the opposite—liquidate as discreetly as possible. Instead, sellers dumped the equivalent of more than 300 tons of the metal in staccato-like blasts during those sessions. THE SUSPICIOUS SELLING resumed this Friday, with the equivalent of 17 tons sold on the New York Comex in two bursts in the morning, according to market sources. And the declines continued after the settlement of futures trading in the early afternoon as the SPDR Gold Trust ETF slumped a total of 2.25% on the day, to close at 131.07, below the April 15 close of 131.31. (The ETF represents a bit less than 1/10th of an ounce of gold.) The current-month May futures contract plunged 1.6%, or $22.20, to $1,364.90 an ounce on the Comex. Read the full thing here ---&gt;

Nobody knows who invented the digital currency Bitcoin. The developer used a pseudonym, Satoshi Nakamoto, and since then there's been a lot of inconclusive internet sleuthing. Ted Nelson, a computer scientist, has posted a video to the web claiming that he's figured it out, and that it's Kyoto University math professor  Shinichi Mochizuki.  Shinichi Mochizuki  Shinichi Mochizuki gained fame last year for figuring the famous ABC Conjecture. Our Walter Hickey explained what this was all about last year. In short, the ABC Conjecture — proposed in 1985 — explores the relationships between prime numbers. It's been described as the most important unsolved problem in Diophantine Analysis, a branch of mathematics that — by working with some of the most simple number systems (like ax + by = 1 or xn + yn = zn) explores some of the deepest relationships in math.  So if you're looking for an instant "real world application," hit the back button — but if you want to see why one equation can tell us so much about how numbers work, read on.  The ABC Conjecture is as follows: Take three positive integers that have no common factor and where a + b = c. For instance, 5, 8, and 13. Now take the distinct prime factors of these integers — in this case 2, 5, and 13 — and multiply them to get a new number, d. In most cases, like this one, d is larger than c. The conjecture states that in rare instances where d is smaller than c, it is usually very close to c. The conjecture also shows that there are a finite number of instances where d is smaller than c.  Mochizuki claims to have cracked this conjecture in a 500-page proof. He went to Philip Exeter Academy, one of the most prestigious High Schools in the country, and graduated in a brief two years. He entered Princeton University at age sixteen and left with a Ph. D at 22. He was a full professor by 33, an absurdly young age for academia. And now, this mathematical rock star may have just cracked one of the most important problems in his field.  Anyway, Ted Nelson's conclusion is somewhat circumstantial, but mainly revolves around the idea that Mochizuki perfectly fits the profile of the Bitcoin creator (a total genius who delivers a flash of something amazing, and then goes quiet again). The Register summarizes Nelson's three points: We've reached out to Mochizuki to see if he really is the Bitcoin creator. Here's Nelson's video: 
To spice things up a bit, a lot of poker rooms at casinos have something called a "Bad Beat" jackpot. A "Bad Beat" is when, say, you have four of a kind (which is an amazing hand) but you lose to someone with an even higher four of a kind. What happens is, the poker room sets up an ever-increasing pot that resets to zero when someone loses on one of these bad beats. According to Reddit user Fat_drunk_estupido the Bad Beat Jackpot at a casino in Southern California got up to $194,633 when this hand occurred: Both players got a straight flush, but one person had the royal flush, while the other had the low end. But the low ender was the huge winner: 177 players in the room took home $221 each. The Bad Beat had a Queen High Straight Flush taking home $58,436. The winning hand was a Royal Flush, taking home $38,933. 6 players at the table going home with $9,733. Via Imgur: 
A big economic story this year has been "Abenomics", Japan's effort to get out of its multi-decade deflationary slump using a combo of monetary policy, fiscal stimulus, and structural reforms. We already know it's produced extraordinary movements in the yen (down big) and the stock market (the Nikkei has surged) but the question remains whether it will have a lasting, positive effect on the real economy. Jeff Sommer at NYT has a piece on the signs that Abenomics is working. One chart that is positive is this one, which shows 'Breakeven Inflation Rates' which simply uses bond prices to come up with a market-based prediction of where inflation will be in 2 years. jbts.co.jp Says Sommer, the increase in the orange line is a sign that inflation is expected to arrive, as the Bank of Japan hopes: Is the new monetary policy working? It hasn’t been in place long, and no up-to-date inflation data is yet in hand. The latest government figures show that in March, Japan’s consumer price index fell 0.5 percent, annualized, a deflationary reading. But Japan’s bond prices imply that expectations for inflation two years from now have already jumped to well above 1.6 percent. “It’s not quantifiable yet, but the psyche of the Japanese consumer may actually be changing,” said Taizo Ishida, lead manager of the Matthews Japan fund, a stock mutual fund for American investors. “Anecdotally, you can feel it,” he said. “People are beginning to put money into equity mutual funds in Japan, and consumers are buying luxury goods. But we’ll have to see where this ends up.”
We were just talking about how the wrongest prediction of the past 5 years was the call for "inflation" or "hyperinflation" due to aggressive monetary easing. In his latest US Macro Dashboard note, Morgan Stanley economist Vincent Reinhart points out that the real story now is the return of deflation risk.    With evidence building that the Q2 soft patch is upon us, worrisome chatter about deflation is taking center stage. Our outlook for some time has been that mounting fiscal drag would show through in Q2 most strongly as sequester effects take hold and a slowdown in global trade hits US shores. Indeed, another run of poor data this week has shown Spring growth may be dampened by weakness in manufacturing, increasing jobless claims, and a stalling housing recovery. The slowdown in activity is not helping the Fed with their consistently significant misses on the employment side of their mandate, but it now appears they may have to turn their attention to supporting inflation from the bottom. While it's well known that the Fed is far away on its employment target, it's also now seeing its inflation target look increasingly perilous. Morgan Stanley
Flickr/dno1967bDES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — It's all about the odds, and one lone ticket in Florida has beaten them all by matching each of the numbers drawn for the highest Powerball jackpot in history at an estimated $590.5 million, lottery officials said Sunday. The single winner was sold at a supermarket in Zephyrhills, Fla., according to Florida Lottery executive Cindy O'Connell. She told The Associated Press by telephone that more details would be released later. "This would be the sixth Florida Powerball winner and right now, it's the sole winner of the largest ever Powerball jackpot," O'Connell told AP. "We're delighted right now that we have the sole winner." She said Florida has had more Powerball winners than any other state. The winner was not immediately identified publicly and O'Connell did not give any indication just hours after Saturday's drawing whether anyone had already stepped forward with that winning ticket. With four out of every five possible combinations of Powerball numbers in play, lottery executives said earlier that someone was almost certain to win the game's highest jackpot, a windfall of hundreds of millions of dollars — and that's after taxes. Saturday night's winning numbers were 10, 13, 14, 22 and 52, with a Powerball of 11. Estimates had earlier put the jackpot at around $600 million. But Powerball's online site said Sunday that the jackpot had reached an estimated $590.5 million. Terry Rich, CEO of the Iowa Lottery, initially confirmed that one Florida winning ticket had been sold. He told AP that following the Florida winner, the Powerball grand prize was being reset at an estimated jackpot of $40 million, or about $25.1 million cash value. The chances of winning the prize were astronomically low: 1 in 175.2 million. That's how many different ways you can combine the numbers when you play. But lottery officials estimated that about 80 percent of those possible combinations had been purchased recently. While the odds are low for any one individual or individuals, O'Connell said, the chance that one hits paydirt is what makes Powerball an "exciting game to play." "There is just the chance that you will have the opportunity and Florida is a huge Powerball state. We have had more winners than any other state that participates in Powerball." Such longshot odds didn't deter people across Powerball-playing states — 43 plus Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Virgin Islands — from lining up at gas stations and convenience stores Saturday for their chance at striking it filthy rich. Calls by AP to the Publix supermarket outlet in Florida where the winning ticket was sold were not answered Sunday. Elsewhere, Rich said, lottery officials reported 33 winning tickets for a $1,000,000 prize each were sold around 17 states, led by six tickets in New York. He said lotteries reported 2 winning tickets each for the $2,000,000 PowerPlay, one in New York and the other in South Carolina. Before the drawing, there was a rush for tickets around the country. At a mini market in the heart of Los Angeles' Chinatown, employees broke the steady stream of customers into two lines: One for Powerball ticket buyers and one for everybody else. Some people appeared to be looking for a little karma. "We've had two winners over $10 million here over the years, so people in the neighborhood think this is the lucky store," employee Gordon Chan said as he replenished a stack of lottery tickets on a counter. The world's largest jackpot was a $656 million Mega Millions jackpot in March 2012. If $600 million, the jackpot would currently include a $376.9 million cash option. Clyde Barrow, a public policy professor at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth, specializes in the gaming industry. He said one of the key factors behind the ticket-buying frenzy is the size of the jackpot — people are interested in the easy investment. "Even though the odds are very low, the investment is very small," he said. "Two dollars gets you a chance." That may be why Ed McCuen has a Powerball habit that's as regular as clockwork. The 57-year-old electrical contractor from Savannah, Ga., buys one ticket a week, regardless of the possible loot. It's a habit he didn't alter Saturday. "You've got one shot in a gazillion or whatever," McCuen said, tucking his ticket in his pocket as he left a local convenience store. "You can't win unless you buy a ticket. But whether you buy one or 10 or 20, it's insignificant." Seema Sharma doesn't seem to think so. The newsstand employee in Manhattan's Penn Station purchased $80 worth of tickets for herself. She also was selling tickets all morning at a steady pace, instructing buyers where to stand if they wanted machine-picked tickets or to choose their own numbers. "I work very hard — too hard — and I want to get the money so I can finally relax," she said. "You never know." ___ Associated Press Radio Correspondent Julie Walker and AP writers Jeffrey Collins in Columbia, S.C., Betsy Blaney in Lubbock, Texas, Russ Bynum in Savannah, Ga., John Rogers in Los Angeles and Verena Dobnick in New York contributed to this report. ___ Follow Barbara Rodriguez at http://twitter.com/bcrodriguez .

Since the economic crisis of 2009, the most incorrect call that people have made has been to call for inflation or hyperinflation due to aggressive monetary easing and/or large government deficits. In a recent blog post, the pseudonymous hedge fund manager Pawelmorski wrote this fantastic line: Inflation is clearly in the toilet and not set to resurface any time soon (so to speak), and looking really extraordinarily low once you look at core measures. The hyperinflationistas have lost the argument so comprehensively that you have a certain grudging admiration that theyâ€™re still sharing their wisdom. We really don't need to go back over all of the hyperinflationistas being referred to here. Basically anyone who's turned on CNBC over the years has heard someone predict a collapsing dollar and spiraling prices, thanks to crazy Bernanke and his magic printing press. Cartoons of Bernanke maniacally flooding the world with dollars litter the web. TheDailyGold.com Gluskin Sheff But it's easy to debunk the misinformed beliefs of the gold bugs who plainly haven't understood the plot. The more fascinating thing is that even here in 2013, we're not seeing much garden variety inflation. In a recent note, BofA's Ethan Harris called the lack of global inflation the the big story of the year. In a world where central banks are characterized as aggressively going to "war" on monetary policy, inflation is once again surprising to the downside. BAML Why aren't we seeing any inflation this year, even in the US where things are better? In a recent post, Hale Stewart posits four ideas: Bottom line. The big, ongoing story is the death of inflation all around the world. While it's true that gold had a great run for a few years. And the people who predicted ongoing economic misery deserve a lot of credit. The folks who said anything about inflation or hyperinflation get big fat zeros. Bank Of America Merrill Lynch
