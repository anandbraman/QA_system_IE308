Jonathan Erns/ReutersI've got you right where I want you, Jeff!Fox is only prepared to raise its offer for Time Warner to $90-$95 per share, sources familiar with Fox's thinking told the Wall Street Journal this week. Fox is also not willing to significantly increase the cash percentage of its offer, the same sources said. Well, for those hoping to see a deal get done, that's ostensibly bad news. Because based on everything we are hearing out of Time Warner, $90-$95 will not be enough to get a deal done. In fact, one of our sources believes, if Fox were to raise its offer to $90-$95, Time Warner would just reject this offer, too. And we haven't talked to any Time Warner shareholder who wants less than $100 a share. So it sounds like a stalemate. But wait... A source familiar with Fox's thinking suggests that the $90-$95 figure referenced in the Wall Street Journal is based on Fox's current balance sheet. Fox is committed to maintaining its investment-grade debt rating. With no additional cash on its balance sheet, raising its offer beyond $90-$95 by increasing its debt could put the debt rating at risk.  However, as we discussed earlier this week, Fox is in late-stage talks to sell stakes in two Europe-based pay-TV companies, Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland, to BSkyB. These sales, a source tells us, could net Fox about $7 billion in cash. With this new cash, Fox could be in a position to raise its Time Warner offer beyond the $90-$95 range without threatening its debt rating. (UPDATE: Fox has, in fact, sold these assets to BSkyB, for a net $7.2 billion.) So the $90-$95 referenced in the Wall Street Journal may not be the highest offer Fox would be willing to make. Time Warner, meanwhile, continues to maintain that Fox does not have the wherewithal to pay what it would take to get a deal done. Before it rejected Fox's original offer, a source says, Time Warner exhaustively analyzed Fox's balance sheet and came to the same conclusion that Fox apparently has: That an offer above $90-$95 would threaten Fox's debt rating and/or create unacceptable dilution for Fox shareholders. This is why Time Warner said, in a very carefully worded press release, that it believes its own strategic plan will create more value for Time Warner shareholders than any offer that Fox is in a position to make. Kevork Djansezian/Getty ImagesOh, no you don't, Rupert!Confronted with this logic, a source familiar with Fox's thinking hypothesized that Time Warner's analysis of Fox's balance sheet had not factored in the possibility of the asset sales—and that this additional liquidity could significantly increase the value of a proposal Fox would be in a position to make. But the source also stressed that Mr. Murdoch is not about to negotiate against himself! Mr. Murdoch doesn't need to own Time Warner, the source observed, sticking to the party line. Time Warner is a nice-to-have for Mr. Murdoch, not a must-have. Mr. Murdoch has demonstrated before—when buying Dow Jones, for example—that his first offer is often his best offer. And there would be no reason in the world for Mr. Murdoch to raise his offer unless or until Time Warner stopped being so standoffish and sat down to talk. (Mr. Murdoch obviously doesn't want to negotiate against himself, but everything we have heard since news of the original offer broke has suggested that Mr. Murdoch would be quite willing to raise his offer if/when Time Warner is willing to sit down and talk. So, in a sense, Mr. Murdoch has already raised his offer. The only question is by how much.) Both sides, by the way, believe that time is working for them, sources say. Fox believes that Time Warner shareholders are getting used to owning an $85 stock and will not be keen to have the stock suddenly plummet to the high $60s again if Time Warner refuses to talk and Murdoch walks. Fox also believes that 15% of Time Warner's pre-deal shareholders have already sold their stock to arbitrageurs at prices in the mid-80s and that these arbitrageurs don't want to see the stock tank and don't give a hoot about Time Warner's long-term strategic plan. These arbitrageurs, who make their living betting on deals like this, will increasingly pressure Time Warner's board to sit down and talk, Fox believes—and, once the two sides start talking, Fox believes, Fox and Time Warner might be able to identify more "synergies" (cost cutting and growth opportunities) that will allow Fox to raise its offer to a level the rest of Time Warner's shareholders will accept. Time Warner, meanwhile, also believes that its position will improve with time. More time will give Time Warner more of a chance to describe its long-term strategic plan in detail its shareholders and show them how it's already working, Time Warner believes. This information will make its shareholders start salivating for more. And the price at which they will be willing to do a deal, Time Warner believes, will rise above the $95-$105 range that some Time Warner shareholders have so far said is enough. So both sides maintain that they're sitting pretty. Then there's the matter of Jeff Bewkes, Time Warner's CEO. By all accounts, Jeff Bewkes has done an extraordinary job as CEO of Time Warner. We were curious, therefore, why we hadn't heard anything about a role for Jeff Bewkes in the combined Fox-Time Warner. We put that question to our sources on both sides. Both sides seem to agree. Fox hasn't ruled out the possibility of a job for Jeff Bewkes in the combined company, but Fox already has all the bosses (and future bosses) it needs. Namely, Mr. Murdoch, Chase Carey, and Mr. Murdoch's children, Elizabeth. Lachlan, and James. Any role for Jeff Bewkes in the combined company, therefore, would likely be a diminutive one. Because there are already plenty of cooks in the Fox kitchen.  SEE ALSO: Mr. Murdoch Won't Be Raising His Time Warner Offer Immediately FREE AppDownload
How do you know if your broker or financial advisor is ripping you off? Simple: Just ask. OK, so maybe it's not as easy as leaving a "Heya, quick question: Are you taking advantage of our relationship? Call me back when you get a sec!" voice mail. But if you're paying for financial advice, there is only one way to ensure that the person you have entrusted with your hard-earned money is acting as a true steward of your financial future and not using your relationship to subsidize a new Bimmer: You have to ask.  "It's not you ..." We're not saying your broker is a bad person. (There are plenty of financial professionals giving their customers good advice and legitimate value for the services they provide.) It's just that most of them are in a bad position. The system they operate in probably pits their financial interests against yours -- precisely the opposite of what you'd expect from someone advertising financial stewardship.  It's that last point you need to discuss with your broker -- specifically, the figure that's commonly disclosed as the AUM fee, which stands for "assets under management." This fee is based on a percentage of the amount of money your broker is managing for you, typically 1% to 2%.  You may think these fees or disclosed fund loads (already of dubious value, given low-cost indexing) are all your broker earns from your business, but the litany of extra commissions, fees, and other payments quietly trading hands not only creates conflicts of interest but also severely cuts into your long-term investment returns. (Here's just one shocking example, but this dynamic plays out time, and time, and time again.) Ask the right questions To find out the real price you're paying for financial advice, we're arming you with 21 critical questions to ask your broker or financial advisor today. The answers will reveal the true cost of the services you receive and show where your broker's true motives lie. A few notes: 21 questions to ask now1. What are your or your firm's potential conflicts of interest regarding incentives to sell particular funds or products? No sense in beating around the bush here. Just ask your broker or advisor point blank where he or she stands. If you get a thorough, well-thought-out response, then the answer will cover many of the following questions. (Still, you can use this list to specifically address types of commissions, fees, bonuses, and other monetary or non-monetary payments, if memories need to be jogged.) 2. What percentage of your total income comes from commissions versus fees? Remember, incentives drive behavior. 3. What is the total compensation you have received from our relationship since first working together? This one could get scary.  4. What balance is the AUM fee charged on? "Beginning of quarter," "end of quarter," and "highest value in quarter" are all possible responses. The third one ensures the greatest cut for your broker, but the previous two can influence how much you're paying as well, based on market movement.  5. Do you have me invested in any mutual funds with 12b-1 fees?  The 12b-1 fee is a kickback a traditional mutual fund pays to your broker. If the answer is "yes," ask why your broker is still using these mutual funds instead of lower-cost ETFs , and whether the performance is compensating for this unnecessary fee.   6. Do you receive soft-dollar money from financial-services companies you do business with? While not as infamous as the 12b-1 fees, they're equally dubious. These are payments made by mutual funds to service providers, but instead of paying in actual dollars, they kick back "in-kind" by passing along valuable business to the brokerage. Sneaky, sneaky.  7. How much do you receive in revenue-sharing payments from your preferred mutual fund partners? As a follow-up, you can ask whether this is completely disclosed on the broker's website or promotional material.  8. Do you, or other advisors at the same firm, get rewarded with trips and other perks for selling certain investment products? As if 12b-1 fees and soft-dollars weren't enough. 9. Why do you recommend an in-service distribution? If you're ever asked to do an in-service distribution -- or a rollover to an IRA made while you continue to work for your employer -- make sure you understand why. If the answer is "better fund choices," ask for a side-by-side comparison of the funds the broker wants to move you into and your current positions. Pay close attention to the expense ratios and comparative performance. Often the motivation here is to just get more assets under management and collect 1% on the new money. 10. Do you or your firm receive commission rebates from exchanges you use to route stock and ETF orders? If the answer is "yes," you'll want to know whether those rebates are passed on to clients like you.  11. Do you discount your AUM fee to reflect my cash balance? Parking cash doesn't require any active management decisions, but it can pad the AUM upon which your bill is based.  12. Do you reduce your AUM fee when you use high-fee active mutual funds? Some advisors may want to target a specific strategy in your account with a targeted vehicle like a specialty mutual fund. This is fine, except that since you're footing the bill, your broker may not have taken the time to shop around for a low-cost alternative that does the same thing, like a targeted ETF, or bothered to reduce his or her own AUM fee on your funds, either.  13. How much interest do I receive on cash balances held in my account?  14. Do you charge an extra hourly rate if I take up more than a certain amount of your time? If the answer is "yes," ask how much, and whether it's withdrawn from your account or billed separately.  15. Can I please see your broker compensation page? If you're an Ameriprise client and receive a recommendation to purchase an insurance contract (term/permanent or annuity), this is a must-ask. This page is printed with almost all insurance policy illustrations and displays the commission amount to the broker you're working with. This is often not shown to clients. If you're not being shown this page, ask why your broker doesn't think it's important for you to know that information. 16. What are the various loads on the funds you sell? These are silent killers of your long-term returns, especially for more modest portfolios.  17. What percentage of the load fees go to you, and what percentage goes to your company? This is a follow-up to the previous question and can reveal the precise commission your advisor personally earns, versus how much goes to the parent company.   18. Does the advisor get a different rate of commission for selling class A shares?A financial advisor typically receives a greater percentage of the sales charge the firm obtains for A shares than for B or C shares. 19. How much does an advisor receive for opening a new account? As a current client, this may not affect you, but it can still reveal where your advisor's effort is likely to be spent. Is the broker focused on your returns, or on growing his or her assets under management? 20. How do the total fees and sales charges for your most popular funds compare with the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 index fund? This is an opportunity cost no-brainer for you to know.  21. And lastly: Will you fully disclose these conflicts of interest, as well as any others we may have missed, including upfront compensation, in writing for me?  Compare notes Beating the market is already hard enough without having your broker add weights to your portfolio. We urge you to ask these questions today. If your financial professional is truly serving you well and with your best interest at heart, he or she should have no problem answering them.

REUTERS/Charles Platiau FA Insights is a daily newsletter from Business Insider that delivers the top news and commentary for financial advisors. There Is No Such Thing As A Truly Passive Investor (AllianceBernstein Blog)  Even investors that take a 100% passive approach are making active decisions, writes Patrick Rudden at AllianceBernstein Blog. "Those who go passive know why they’re doing it," writes Rudden. "Instead of paying active managers to try to select securities to beat a particular index, they’ve decided to hire managers to track that index. Yet this approach involves several active choices." Passive investors make some very active choices he writes. First they decide how to allocate their assets, they they choose the indices they want tracked. Then comes "The important decision about how much to allocate to bonds versus equities is an active choice. And so is the decision about how much to allocate to US versus non-US stocks." "...But passive investing may be a misnomer. Asset allocation and index selection are important active decisions. And so is the decision about how a tracking manager will track. So investors should recognize when they are making active decisions that are likely to have a significant impact on their investment outcomes—and think carefully about the choices they make." What Investors Can Do When The Market Doesn't Believe The Fed (BlackRock Blog) In her semi-annual monetary policy report to Congress, Fed chair Janet Yellen  said quantitative easing and pace of monthly asset purchases will depend on jobs and inflation. She also said the Fed will take its time in raising the federal funds rate. While markets have already priced in the end of the QE program, "changes in the Fed Funds rate are another story," writes Matthew Tucker at BlackRock Blog. "The bottom line, the market expects the Fed to raise short term rates more slowly than the Fed minutes would indicate." "This is a fresh reminder that for the near term the Fed and their actions are likely to remain the primary driver of markets, and especially short term interest rates. As we move closer to the first funds hike it is likely that we will see the difference cited above converge. Whether that means the Fed moving more slowly (or more quickly) than they anticipate, or the market expectations backing off is hard to say, but one way or another, we know the market and the Fed will converge.  "Because that adjustment has the potential to be volatile, and because the shorter end of the yield curve will bear the brunt of any increase in volatility, we remain cautious on 2 to 5 year maturities. Interestingly, the longer end of the yield curve may exhibit relatively lower volatility as the market and the Fed square off. While long-term investors should be aware of the potential for interest rate volatility, they should keep in mind that their returns will ultimately be driven more by coupon income and the reinvestment of that income." RICH BERNSTEIN: People Become Visibly Disappointed When I Tell Them About The Best Investment Opportunity In The World (Business Insider) Rich Bernstein at Berstein Advisors was asked what the world's best investment opportunity was. When Bernstein said it was high-yield municipal bonds the person was visibly disappointed. Bond investors currently prefer investing in Iraq than U.S. municipalities. As of July 23, Republic of Iraq bonds due in January 2028 were yielding 7.08%; high-yield municipal bonds in the U.S. were yielding 9%, or 1.9% more than Iraqi bonds. That spread suggests that Iraq is less likely to default than some U.S. municipalities.  "Everybody thinks every municipality is going bankrupt," Bernstein said at a recent breakfast attended by Business Insider. "It's just not true. We're going through a very normal cycle in municipal finance. An accentuated cycle, admittedly, but a normal cycle." The Implications Of Lower Dealer Liquidity In Muni Bonds (Vanguard)   There is a lack of dealer liquidity in the municipal market and the overall bond market. Chris Alwine, principal at Vanguard says that following the financial crisis "the regulatory environment got more difficult for the dealers to take risk." That made the dealers made it difficult for the trading desk to to take on too much risk or make the balance sheet grow.  "So, there’s a few implications of this. The first implication would be that we’re going to see higher price volatility in particular on the downside. So, when yields are rising and prices are falling, that may be sharper than in the past to get to the clearing level because the dealer community won’t buy the bond to position it. "The second big implication here is that as a fund manager, you need to have an intentional liquidity policy. And at Vanguard, we’ve had a long-standing policy in munis—a market with less liquidity than other fixed income markets—to hold more cash or more high-quality assets that will have liquidity when the environment gets difficult." When Clients Qualify For Social Security Benefits From A Divorced Spouse (InvestmentNews)  Mary Beth Franklin, contributing editor at InvestmentNews has recently fielded questions on how advisors can estimate social security benefits for divorced clients to plug into their retirement income calculations. "In order to collect Social Security benefits as a divorced spouse, the marriage must have lasted at least 10 years and the client must be at least 62 and unmarried. In addition, the ex-spouse must also be at least 62," she writes.  "Assuming your client meets the length-of-marriage, age and single-status test, they can collect Social Security benefits as if they were still married. The maximum benefit as a divorced spouse is equal to one-half of the amount the ex-spouse's can collect at full retirement age; less if collected earlier. And your client may be able to collect spousal benefits even if her ex has not yet collected his — as long as he is old enough to collect and they have been divorced for at least two years."

REUTERS/Lucas JacksonSecondMarket founder Barry Silbert is stepping down as SecondMarket CEO to focus exclusively on Bitcoin. He'll remain Chairman and CEO of SecondMarket Holdings, Inc., but now plans to spin off the firm's digital currency activities. Silbert has been a leading cryptocurrency evangelist, and is currently planning on launching the first U.S. Bitcoin exchange network. He's also invested millions of dollars in cryptocurrency startups through his Bitcoin Opportunity Corp. venture capital fund. "My passion for Bitcoin is no secret and I feel it is the right time to make this transition," he said in a statement. "Our intention is to formally separate the two business lines at the appropriate point in time. "  Bill Siegel has been appointed interim SecondMarket CEO. In previous years, SecondMarket was known as a market for buying and selling shares of fast-growing private companies like Facebook, Twitter and Zynga. Here's Silbert's full statement: Believe it or not, it was ten years ago that I founded the company that would later be renamed SecondMarket.  Over the past decade, SecondMarket has gained tremendous experience breaking open new markets such as private company stock, auction rate securities, bankruptcy claims, community bank stock and, most recently, bitcoin.  The competencies and lessons learned opening these markets has been invaluable.   As with all startups, we have had some fantastic successes and some clear failures.  But along the way, SecondMarket successfully transitioned from a telephone-based broker of illiquid assets into a highly scalable, product-focused organization that has redefined how private companies and funds raise capital and facilitate liquidity for their stakeholders.  We have product market fit, a fantastic team, a record number of private company/fund customers and are very well positioned for long term success.  The future for SecondMarket has never been brighter.    While I have never been more excited about SecondMarket, I have chosen to move on from day-to-day management of the private company/fund business so that I can focus 100% of my energy on our digital currency business.  My passion for bitcoin is no secret and I feel it is the right time to make this transition.  Our intention is to formally separate the two business lines at the appropriate point in time.  In the meantime, I will remain Chairman and CEO of our parent holding company.   Bill Siegel, who has been instrumental in the development and refocusing of our private issuer products, has been appointed Interim CEO of that business line.  Our clients are in great hands with Bill at the helm, and we are running a formal search for a permanent CEO for our private company business, in which Bill is a candidate.  FREE AppDownload

REUTERS/Claro CortesTwo tourists walk past advertisements of foreign companies near the airport of Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon) March 8, 1994.Visa just reported earnings for its fiscal third quarter that beat on both the top and bottom lines. For the quarter, Visa earned $2.17 per share, better than the $2.10 that was expected by analysts, on revenue of $3.16 billion, beating expectations for $3.15 billion.  Following the report, Visa shares were down 2%. Visa CEO Charlie Scharf said the company's earnings grew, "in the face of a continued, subdued global economy." At more than $222 per share, Visa is the largest segment of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, as the index is "price-weighted," meaning its components are weighted by the price of their stock, giving the heaviest weighting to the most expensive members.  For its fiscal-year 2014, Visa expects revenue growth of 9%-10% and earnings per share growth in the 17.5%-18.5% range.  FREE AppDownload
Getty Images / Alexandra BeierBoth GM and Ford reported second quarter earnings today, and while the General slightly missed expectations and the Blue Oval notched a beat, an interesting subplot was that both companies are starting to see their European business pick up. Ford managed a quarterly profit in Europe for the first time in three years. This was an important milestone for the company and newly minted CEO Mark Fields, who took over from the extremely difficult act to follow known as Alan Mulally (he basically saved Ford prior to the financial crisis). Ford has always taken Europe seriously and is trying to bolster its global competitive position relative to GM and foreign rivals like Toyota, Volkswagen, and Fiat. GM's misadventures across the pond are more complicated. Last year, it pulled the plug on Chevrolet in Europe, with the hope that its could shift market share to Opel, a brand that the automaker nearly jettisoned in the aftermath of its bailout and bankruptcy in 2009 (Hummer, Pontiac, Saturn, and Saab were sent packing, however). Even before this year's massive recall — 30 million vehicles and counting — GM's European operations were dragging on the company's full recovery. So, on GM's earnings call today, it was encouraging to hear CFO Chuck Stevens change his European outlook from "break even" to "profitable." O.K., it may take 10 years to get there. But there's light at the end of the tunnel, although it's a pretty long tunnel. CEO Mary Barra also highlighted GM's flickering Euro-recovery. Market share for Opel and its British sibling, Vauxhall, rose in eleven European markets. And the Opel Mokka is, Barra said, the bestselling SUV in Germany (thanks to the industry practice known as "platform sharing," it's known to Americans as the Buick Encore). Even though business looks better for GM in Europe, the company is far from free of troubles: South America, as Barra said on the call, is "very challenging." Venezuela in particular is generating some major headaches. Ford is also having issues there, so we'll have to see if the carmakers' South America problems go the way of their problems in Europe or get worse in the second half of 2014. FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Stefan Wermuth Starbucks announced earnings of $0.67 per share for its fiscal Q3. Expectations were for adjusted EPS of $0.66 per share. The stock was down 0.5% in after-market trading. The coffee purveyor said revenues came in at $4.15 billion, against $4.14 billion expected. Global same-store sales climbed 6%, topping estimates for 5.1%. Coffee futures have climbed 61% this year, more than any other commodity listed at FinViz.

REUTERS/Guang NiuIt's hard being a trader shorting stocks. Short sellers, or investors betting that the price of a stock will go down, have to overcome unexpected fees, as well as simple math: you can only ever make 100% on a short position, but your losses are potentially infinite. And just this morning, SodaStream, a stock that is heavily shorted, saw shares pop after Bloomberg reported the company was in talks to go private. But this doesn't stop traders from taking their best shot.  Year-to-date, all of the major stock indexes are higher, with the Nasdaq gaining more than 7.5% and the benchmark S&amp;P 500 adding 7%. Despite these broad gains, we've found 30 stocks with market caps larger than $2 billion that people are betting against like crazy. On the list, of course, is Herbalife, the company that hedge funder Bill Ackman has accused of being a pyramid scheme.  Other high-profile companies on the list include electric carmaker Tesla and yoga apparel maker lululemon.  This list, however, also exhibits two major themes: China and solar energy. We ranked the stock by short interest as a percentage of shares outstanding, going from the least shorted to the most. FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Thomas PeterSoldiers of the 209th corp of the Afghan army (ANA) roll up the red carpet after a visit by German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen (not pictured) at Camp Shaheen outside Mazar-i-Sharif.Stocks finished mixed, but little changed, after economic data early in the session was mixed and a flood of corporate earnings again poured in. By virtue of a higher close, the S&amp;P 500 made yet another all-time high. First, the scoreboard: And now, the scoreboard: 1) This morning, weekly initial jobless claims data came in way better than expected, as 284,000 individuals filed for unemployment, down from 302,000 last week and lower than the 307,000 that was expected by economists. This reading was the lowest number for the index since February 2006. Following the report, Neil Dutta at Renaissance Macro said that the underlying trend in weekly claims remains healthy, but noted that this data, "likely informs more about production than employment." 2) Markit's preliminary U.S. PMI reading came in at 56.3, worse than last month's 57.3 and below the 57.4 that was expected by economists. The report also indicated that job creation was the weakest since September 2013, but Markit's Chris Williamson said recent data remains strong. "U.S. manufacturers are enjoying a summer of scorching growth," Williamson said. "Output grew in July at a rate only just below the four-year peak seen in June as inflows of new orders surged higher again. The data suggest the sector is growing at an annualized rate of roughly 8% as we moved into the second half of the year. The growth rebound that the survey has signaled for the second quarter therefore looks to have been sustained into the third quarter." 3) Housing data also disappointed, as new home sales fell 8.1% in June to an annualized rate of 406,000, worse than the 5.8% decline expected by economists. Following the report, Michael Gapen at Barclays said, "The June decline plus revision to May have erased the rebound in Q2 new homes sales that we had expected... Altogether, this is a much softer report than expected and suggests housing demand has stabilized in recent quarter, as opposed to improving." 4) It was a tough day for traders betting against Zillow or SodaStream, as shares of both companies soared following possible deal reports from Bloomberg. Zillow shares gained more than 15% after Bloomberg said the company is seeking to acquire online real estate rival Trulia. Following the report, Trulia shares gained nearly 32%. SodaStream shares also surged, gaining about 10% after Bloomberg reported the company is in talks with a private investment company to go private.  5) The International Monetary Fund, or IMF, cut its global GDP forecast to 3.4% from 3.6%, with the organization saying that, "Global growth could be weaker for longer, given the lack of robust momentum in advanced economies." Among the biggest cuts was the IMF's slashing of 2014 U.S. GDP growth, to 1.7% from 2.8%.  6) After last night reporting better than expected profit and revenue, Facebook shares made a new all-time high, closing at $74.98. 7) Among notable companies reporting earnings before the market open were Caterpillar, which reported better than expected results but saw shares fall more than 3%, and General Motors, which took a $900 million charge on potential future recalls and saw shares fall nearly 5%.  8) Notable earnings reports expected after the market close include Amazon, Visa, and Starbucks.  Don't Miss: 30 Stocks Traders Are Shorting Like Crazy » FREE AppDownload
Amazon's EPS was worse than expected, though its revenue was right in line with expectations. Revenue guidance for next quarter was about in line with expectations, but it guided to a big loss. That sent the stock down about 10% after-hours. Here are the numbers: The operating loss for Q2 was $15 million, compared with operating income of $79 million in second quarter 2013. The net loss was $126 million. The thing that really stands out is operating loss guidance for next quarter of between $410 million and $810 million, compared to just $25 million a year ago. According to Bloomberg, analysts were only expecting a $10 million loss. This guidance includes about $410 million for stock-based compensation. On Amazon's earnings call, CFO Tom Szkutak also said that the company plans to spend more than $100 million on original video content in the third quarter. Amazon has a handful of new shows coming this year, all of which are available for free for its Amazon Prime customers (the Prime membership fee rose from $79 to $99 earlier this year). Here's a chart of Amazon's global revenues, from BI Intelligence: Business Insider Intelligence  This has been a big year for Amazon. The company just released its new Fire smartphone, and launched a bunch of other products this year, including a TV streaming box, an unlimited e-book subscription service, and a music-streaming service.

Note from dshort: At the request of The Advisory Group in San Francisco, here's updated comparison of four major cyclical bear markets. The numbers are through the July 23rd close. This chart series features an overlay of the Four Bad Bears in U.S. history since the market peak in 1929. They are: The series includes four versions of the overlay: nominal, real (inflation-adjusted), total-return with dividends reinvested and real total-return. The first chart shows the price, excluding dividends for these four historic declines and their aftermath. As of today's close are now 1708 market days from the 2007 peak in the S&amp;P 500.  Click for a larger image Inflation-Adjusted Performance  Click for a larger image Nominal Total Returns Now let's look at a total return comparison with dividends reinvested. The recovery following the 1973 Oil Embargo Bear is the top performer, up 48.3% from the 2007 peak, with the current post-Financial Crisis recovery in close second.  Click for a larger image Real (Inflation-Adjusted) Total Returns When we adjust total returns for inflation, the picture significantly changes. The spread between three of the four markets narrows, and the current real total return has pulled far ahead of the others. Second place, by this metric, goes to the recovery following the Crash of 1929.  Click for a larger image Here is a table showing the relative performance of these four cycles at the equivalent point in time.  For a better sense of how these cycles figure into a larger historical context, here's a long-term view of secular bull and bear markets, adjusted for inflation, in the S&amp;P Composite since 1871. These charts are not intended as a forecast but rather as a way to study the current market in relation to historic market cycles. Footnote: In previous commentaries on these bad bears, I used the Dow for the first event and the S&amp;P 500 for the other three. However, I'm now including a pair of total return versions of the chart, which requires dividend data. Thus I'm now using the S&amp;P 90, for which I have dividend data. The S&amp;P 90 was a daily index launched by Standard &amp; Poor's in 1926 and preceded the S&amp;P 500, which dates from March 1957.  Inflation adjustment is based on the Consumer Price Index.

Julia La Roche for Business InsiderGoldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein and former NYC Mayor Michael Bloomberg The FT's Tracy Alloway is reporting that Goldman Sachs is leading an effort amongst big banks to create their own instant messaging system for traders and bankers.  The project is called "Babble" and it's a big deal because it could be a threat to the Bloomberg Terminal. In case you're not familiar, a Bloomberg Terminal is basically a computer that allows Wall Streeters to instant message each other, obtain real-time market data, news, and stock quotes among many other functions.  A subscription for a terminal costs about $20,000 per year. Banks and hedge funds pay Bloomberg LP millions of dollars a year to buy Bloomberg terminal accounts for their employees. A year ago, it was revealed that Bloomberg News reporters used private information from Bloomberg terminals to spy on employees at banks like Goldman and JPMorgan to fuel their coverage.  Specifically, reporters were looking to see whether employees had logged on or not to determine if they were still with their firm.  A spokesperson for Goldman declined to comment when contacted by Business Insider.  FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Sukree SukplangIf you're short Zillow or SodaStream, it's been a bad Thursday. Shares of both companies are spiking sharply higher following reports in Bloomberg that the companies could be involved in deals. This morning, Bloomberg's David Wainer and Manual Baigorri reported that SodaStream is in talks with an investment firm about going private in a deal that would value the company at $828 million, or about $40 per share. Following the report, SodaStream shares were up as much as 18%, and in afternoon trade were up about 13%. According to data from FinViz, about 33% of SodaStream's outstanding shares are held short, meaning traders are betting the stock will fall in price. And later in the afternoon, Bloomberg's Alex Sherman and Jeffrey McCracken reported that Zillow is seeking to buy Trulia, which like Zillow operates an online real estate marketplace.  Zillow is also heavily shorted, with about 31.8% of Zillow shares outstanding currently held short. Zillow has also been a past target of short selling website Citron Research, which most recently wrote a critical report on the company's marketing deal with a New York real estate broker in late June.  Yesterday we outlined some of the challenges that short sellers face, and today's spikes in SodaStream and Zillow could be considered yet challenge for short sellers: headline risk, or the chance that a stock you're betting against rockets higher following a news story or earnings report. As Matt Ringgenberg, Assistant Professor of Finance at Washington University in St. Louis told Business Insider earlier this week, on average, stocks that are heavily shorted tend to perform worse than stocks that aren't, suggesting that short sellers know something about a stock other investors might not.  This potential knowledge edge, however, doesn't make up for the fact that as a short seller, you have unlimited downside but limited upside. The stock you're betting against can only fall to $0, whether from $1 or $100 per share. FREE AppDownload
Courtesy of ZillowSpencer RascoffReal estate site Zillow is looking into acquiring rival Trulia, reports Bloomberg's Alex Sherman and Jeffrey McCracken. "Zillow could value Trulia at as much as $2 billion in a purchase, and an agreement may be announced as soon as next week," they reported citing anonymous sources. Trulia, which had a market cap of roughly $1.5 billion before Bloomberg's report crossed, surged 30%. Zillow, which has a market cap of just over $5 billion, is up 20%. It's one of the most heavily shorted stocks in the market. "Talks between the companies are ongoing and may not lead to a deal," the Bloomberg reporters caveated.

Facebook/patrontequilaGrand Patrón Budeos Tequila (not pictured) costs $35 per shot.Tequila is meant for sipping as much as shooting — meaning you don't need to be trashed in a bar to enjoy. This south-of-the-border liquor is made from the blue agave plant found in Jalisco, Mexico, and has been refined over hundreds of years. We turned to the experts at FindTheBest to help us track down the 10 best tequilas you can buy. FindTheBest ranked the tequilas based on a weighted average of the following five rating sources: the San Francisco World Spirits Competition, the International Wine and Spirit Competition, Wine Magazine Enthusiast, Beverage Testing Institute, and Tequila.net. The Montejima Reposado uses only the best Blue Agave from the lowlands of Jalisco. After resting in white oak for two months, it offers fruity notes, with a pleasant balance of wood and vanilla. If you want to get rowdy on a budget, a shot of Pieda Azul Reposado costs about half as much as the average tequila. The oak barrel infuses rich flavors of caramel and vanilla that soften to a smooth, honey finish.  Another bargain tequila, X X X Siglo Treinta is a premium pouring spirit with a bold attack. Its long finish allows you to experience all of the fire, without the burn. Blue Head Silver offers a crystal clear, unaged spirit with great character and a lengthy finish. Intense, yet earthy flavors develop in the mouth, and give way to a pungent, complex aroma. El Agave Artesanal Silver uses agave hearts roasted in clay ovens, made from the same rich volcanic soil where the blue agave grows in Jalisco. Its quality agave combined with its triple distillation process creates an unparalleled smoothness and clarity. Marketing Global Brands Corp.El Capo Extra-Aged Añejo TequilaA Double Gold winner at the World Spirit Competition, the U4RIK Añejo is sweet and almost floral. Aged in specially selected oak barrels for two years, the spirit finishes with just a hint of whiskey flavor. The second most expensive tequila on this list, the El Capo Extra-Aged Añejo lures you in with the aroma of strong vanilla, caramel, oak, and almonds. Aged five years, it seals the deal with a robust body of walnut, chocolate, coffee, and a sprinkling of dried fruits. After two distillations, the Raizul Premium Añejo ages in French oak barrels, made from wood in the Citeaux forests of Burgundy and featuring a medium toast. Agave, honey, vanilla, dried fruits, and spices combine for a one-of-a-kind tequila. Drinking the AsomBroso Silver Tequila is an experience, from the first waff of fennel, licorice, anise, and dried herbs to the toasty and mallow finish. Areation brings out the milk chocolate, olive brine, rye bread, and green olive — yes, you read that right. Facebook/patrontequilaGran Patrón Burdeos TequilaA shot of Gran Patrón Burdeos costs approximately $35, making it one of the most expensive tequilas on the market. This handmade, luxury añejo is crafted from the finest 100% Weber blue agave from the highlands of Jalisco, matured in a combination of new American and French oak barrels, and distilled again before it is racked in vintage Bordeaux barrels. Offering notes of oak, light agave, vanilla, and raisings, its finish is velvety smooth. FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Robert GalbraithFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg walks through Facebook headquarters prior to unveiling the company's new location services feature called "Places" at a news conference in Palo Alto, California, on Aug. 18, 2010.We doubt this is Mark Zuckerberg's goal in life, but if he wanted to be the richest man in the world, Facebook's stock has to go to $200.  We got that number from Bloomberg wealth reporter David de Jong on Twitter. He says at $200 Zuckerberg would overtake Bill Gates as the world's richest person — assuming all things stay the same as they are now. (De Jong was responding to a tweet from NYT columnist Farhad Manjoo.) Facebook's stock was trading at $76.20 on Wednesday morning, so it needed to almost triple. Facebook's current market cap is $195.4 billion. If the stock went to $200, Facebook would be worth over $500 billion. For some comparison, Apple is currently valued at $580 billion.  Could Facebook do it? Can it reach $500+ billion?  When Apple broke through the $500 billion barrier, it was doing ~$33 billion in annual profit, which was a 15X price-to-earnings ratio. That's roughly in line with the market as a whole over time. Price to earnings (P/E) is approximately how much an investor has to pay for $1 of earnings. It's a way to compare the value of stocks to one another. However, the better comparison for Facebook might be Google, which is a software/internet company. Apple is viewed as a hardware company, so it has a tougher P/E ratio. With a $401 billion market cap, Google has a P/E of 31, and earnings of ~$13 billion.  Facebook currently has a P/E of 98, and its trailing 12-month profits are $1.91 billion. If we use Google as a comparison, and Facebook's P/E eventually contracts to 31, then net income has to reach ~$16.1 billion, an ~8X increase from where it's at today. If we use Apple/the market, then Facebook has to get its net income to $33 billion, which is 16X where it's at today.  Could Facebook get there? Certainly!  Facebook has only scratched the surface of its potential. The core business' revenue is still growing at 61% on a year-over-year basis. It's sitting on Instagram, which could be another advertising juggernaut, and then there's WhatsApp and Facebook messages. Plus there's Oculus, and who knows what else Facebook can think of? So, while it may not be his goal in life, Mark Zuckerberg can very conceivably become the richest man in the world.  FREE AppDownload
Wong Maye-E/APAn office worker walks along the Singapore River front during the lunch hour. These are the best of times and the worst of times in Singapore, the world’s only global city without a natural hinterland, whose prosperity and good governance are the envy of much of the world, and a model for others to follow.  But while the city-state remains an alluring success story to much of the outside world, Singaporeans themselves are starting to question the long-term viability of their longstanding adherence to elite governance, meritocracy, the primacy of growth and state paternalism. The “Singapore consensus” that the People’s Action Party (PAP) government constructed and maintained in the last five decades is fraying, partly because many citizens perceive it to be outdated. The Singapore consensus has been underpinned by the notion of vulnerability—that because of its small size, lack of natural resources, ethnic and religious diversity, and geographic location in a potentially volatile region, the city-sized nation is inherently and immutably vulnerable. More: Singapore’s public housing looks like this From this existentially anguished reality, a developmental belief system emerged. Its tenets include a strict academic meritocracy as the best way to sort talent; elite governance insulated from the short-termism and myopia of ordinary democratic pressures; the primacy of growth, delivered through a heavy dependence on foreign labour and capital; an acceptance of the need to equalise opportunities but not outcomes; and an indifference to inequality, as reflected in the state’s aversion to welfare. The Singapore consensus made possible impressive socioeconomic development for much of the past fifty years, when demographic and economic conditions were also far more favorable. Yet today many Singaporeans are contesting it. At first glance this might seem odd: Singapore has one of the highest per capita incomes in the world. But its economic success masks some uncomfortable truths about life in this city-state. Flickr/Philippe PutIncome and wealth inequalities in Singapore are among the highest in the developed world, while the cost of living has spiraled in recent years. For many of its residents, the country’s impressive material achievements have not translated into higher levels of happiness or well-being. In various surveys, Singaporeans are found to work some of the longest hours in the developed world and are described as one of the world’s least happy peoples. Almost three-quarters are afraid to get sick because of perceived high healthcare costs while more than half indicate they would emigrate if given the chance. In December 2013, Singapore had its first riot in fifty years – reflecting its inability (and possibly, unwillingness) to accommodate the more than one million low-skilled foreign workers in Singapore. Yet its economic model is still highly dependent on taking in increasing numbers of such workers as Singaporeans continue to shun and stigmatize menial jobs.   Two years ago, low-wage mainland Chinese bus drivers, bereft of bargaining power, instigated Singapore’s first labor strike in twenty-six years. Meanwhile, economic pressures coupled with the lack of efforts at fostering integration have led to an uptick in racism and xenophobia, tarnishing Singapore’s reputation for openness and tolerance. A country the business community long admired for its stability and openness to foreign nationals and ideas is now witnessing pent-up tensions bubbling over from time to time. More: Saving and social welfare in Singapore In many ways, Singapore is a victim of its own success. From the 1970s to 1990s, it developed from a manufacturing and trading hub to a global service and knowledge economy. In the process, a nascent, post-colonial misfit evolved into one of the world’s most well-governed states and dynamic economies. This rapid transformation, driven and engineered by the state, outpaced the ability of entrenched ideologies, policies and institutions to keep up. At the same time, contradictions in the Singapore story are beginning to emerge. For instance, the government’s aspirations for Singapore to be an entrepreneurial and innovation-driven economy collide with the institutions, policies and practices that inhibit risk-taking, experimentation, collaboration, and egalitarian norms—all of which are critical for a creative economy. Singapore’s global city ambitions bump up against an emerging national identity. The nation faces an ideological quandary, as its own people question whether its strict academic meritocracy and the belief in the necessity of elite governance has also bred a narrow bureaucratic and political class that is increasingly out of touch with ordinary citizens. This has happened precisely as the electorate, increasingly weary of a sycophantic government-controlled national media, is seeking more mature engagement and debate about Singapore’s future. By failing to adapt to these new socioeconomic and political realities, Singapore has set the scene for a fierce clash between competing societal and political visions. The big question is how to forge a new consensus—which will involve, among other things, greater welfare and lower immigration—without swinging too far in the other direction, and without undermining the very efficiency and openness that made Singapore so successful in the first place. At the same time, an increasingly plural political scene is likely to offer voters greater choice about the balance they want to strike. In South Korea and Taiwan, the transition to full democracy was, initially at least, wrenching, socially divisive and politically destabilizing. But both countries managed eventually to amble towards stable, rule-based and competitive democratic systems. This, in turn, paved the way for the emergence of properly organized, collectively financed welfare states that enabled both countries to balance economic growth with social investments in areas such as healthcare, old age security and unemployment protection. Singapore’s transition is likely to be much less wrenching and destabilizing. First, the city-state is nowhere near as repressive as the (military) dictatorships in South Korea and Taiwan that ruled until the 1980s. Equally important is the fact that the vast majority of Singaporeans are homeowners. A home-owning society is far less likely to upset the apple cart of stability and prosperity. For these and other reasons, we are sanguine about Singapore’s transition to a liberal democracy with a far more redistributive state. Our optimism stands in stark contrast to the government’s fears about how increased democratic pressures here will make Singapore less governable, impede quick and enlightened decision making by elites who know better, and increase the likelihood of policies being made for short-term or populist reasons. Edgar Su/ReutersThe skyline of Singapore's central business district is seen at dusk as operations continue at a PSA International port terminalWe think such fears are mostly misplaced. The contest in Singapore is less about basic political rights and freedoms. But neither is it just over “bread and butter” issues. Rather, it is a post-modern debate over people’s ability to determine what constitutes achievement and well-being. While a narrow focus on GDP growth and material prosperity helped to raise living standards early on, it has proven to be an incomplete barometer of success for Singaporeans. For businesses, investors and policymakers in Singapore, the days of easy political consensus, stability and insulation from short-term electoral demands are over. Having sacrificed over a generation to attain prosperity, Singaporeans are now wrestling with what comes next. FREE AppDownload
AntiqueStocks.comPink Sheets printed in 1984 by the National Quotation Bureau, listing all the over-the-counter stocks and their market makers, along with prices.  July 2014 may go down as a defining month of this bull market, since it brought us the overnight sensation known as Cynk, an internet penny stock that had been floating under the radar until it got pumped up more than 24,000% then just as soon suspended by the SEC.  How did this happen?  Cynk was traded on OTC Markets Group Inc., a 101-year-old company now headquartered in Soho. It is the 21st century iteration of the company that invented pink sheets, the National Quotation Bureau. Pink sheets were where your broker use to call other brokers for trades in companies that had publicly available shares but which weren’t listed on a major exchange. You can see what they used to look like above.  Some of these would have been shares in large overseas companies that for whatever reason weren't interested in U.S. liquidity. Many more were smaller U.S. firms that couldn't afford it. And some would have been Cynk-like. That is mostly how the more-than-18,000 securities OTCM quotes breaks down. A third of its total listings, and two-thirds of its dollar volume, are in international ADRs (American Depository Receipts) like Roche, Heineken, and Walmart de Mexico. The rest are smaller companies that were looking for a scaled-down version of going public.   Things can get a little dicey in that second group. So OTCM divides its securities into multiple sections depending on a firm’s level of reporting and verifiable information, ranging from companies — 354 in total — that are listed as totally current in their disclosure and that have received third party advisory ("OTCQX"), to another set — numbering 8,656 — that the broker-dealers OTCM pulls quotes from have not or are no longer willing or able to publicly quote due to the absence of investor interest ("Grey Market"), company information availability or regulatory compliance. 9,543 fall somewhere in between ("OTCQB" and "OTC Pink"). Despite their variable reporting, most are legitimate. A company called EME Reorganization Trust saw volume this weekend of 115 million shares, which are worth $0.13. That might sound sketchy, but they're simply a corporate entity created after two big energy companies merged. Or Pleasant Kids, which sells children's water bottles. Its shares are worth $0.0009. Last year it entered into a share-exchange agreement with New York Bagel Deli where Pleasant gained all of NYBD's capital but got stuck with its old ticker symbol. The company has been consistently filing reports with the SEC since 2008, though it continues to operate at a major loss.   But some aren't right. OTCM keeps a list of "Caveat Emptor" securities that the firm, or one of its feeder brokers, has flagged as being outside the bounds of any modicum of reporting standard.  There are more than 1,200 of them. They come with a skull-and-crossbones. OTCM"Caveat Emptor" stocks OTCM CEO Cromwell Coulson explained the role his marketplace plays, despite the presence of these stocks, and those that, while they haven't been blacklisted, still trade at ultra-low levels. Stock pickers he said, can still derive a lot of value from sniffing out a small firm with great potential. OTCMCromwell Coulson"Small company markets are not about the weeds, they're about what grows out of them," he told us at OTCM's headquarters. "They're about companies giving information so that someone intelligent can go allocate capital."   He also explained why these kinds of companies even bother going public.   "There are a lot complex regulations you have to pay for to be on an exchange that smaller and global companies don't need," he said. "Major exchanges work really well for the Cokes and Pepsis, for the S&amp;P500, but they're very costly and complex for the smallest companies." As an SEC registered alternative trading system for regulated broker-dealers to provide investors the best price all types of securities, OTCM does not have the broader regulatory authority of an exchange or a Self-Regulatory Organization (“SRO”).  Only FINRA or the SEC can legally halt all brokers from trading in a public company's shares.  OTCM has a system of tiered marketplaces – OTCQX, OTCQB and OTC Pink – that incentivize disclosure and categorize companies based on the quality of their operations and availability of information so investors and brokers have information to make good choices and regulators can bring strong consequences. As an alternative trading system, OTCM is not obligated to vet any of the stocks they quote. And only FINRA and the SEC can legally halt all brokers from trading in a company's shares.  In Cynk's case, OTCM flagged the stock with a "caveat emptor" skull and crossbones symbol on July 9, after Cynk's shares had more than doubled. Cynk shares thus traded another day, rising as high as $21.50; they'd  traded as low as $0.08 last year. The SEC issued its halt order July 11. "I Tweeted on Thursday saying it was not a question of if the SEC halts this, it's when," Coulson said. "It was going to trade at some ludicrous level for some amount of time — which was a day — the SEC was going to halt it, and everyone involved in that stock are going wish they weren’t involved."  Yet some people find the urge to trade companies like Cynk irresistible.  "If you point to the people who were buying Cynk and told them, You really should buy [a community bank], this great bank that pays dividends, that's close to you, you might even be a depositor there — they’d tell you that’s boring."  Year-to-date, OTCM has seen slightly above average overall dollar volumes, and well above average flows into stocks worth less than $5, though as a percentage of YTD flows they're relatively low. Coulson does not believe there's not much to extrapolate about the broader state of markets from what happened with Cynk.  OTCM OTCM He does think it's a sign greater baseline transparency is needed among listing securities, and has testified to Congress on this point recently. OTCM is also beefing up its own information standards for SEC reporting companies on its OTCQB venture-stage marketplace. They already have a list of banned lawyers.  "With SEC reporting, you have complete disclosure about a company's finances, but you don’t have full disclosure about the people — who their advisors and associates and affiliates are, and the number of shares outstanding. Our new standards for OTCQB will help change that."" But as long as there are free markets, there are going to be people trying to game stocks like Cynk.  "There’s a subset of investors who don't actually want to invest, who just want prove that they’re better than other people," Coulson said. "They want to prove they can trade better, and speculate more, and I don't think you can get rid of them." FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Robert GalbraithActor Bill Murray drops to his knees after making a putt."Somebody asked the other day what the world's best investment opportunity is, and when I told him, he was visibly disappointed," said Rich Bernstein of Bernstein Advisors. Bernstein was talking about high-yield municipal bonds. Investors in the bond market currently prefer investing in Iraq over U.S. municipalities. As of Wednesday, Republic of Iraq bonds due in January 2028 were yielding 7.08%; high-yield municipal bonds in the U.S. were yielding 1.9% more than Iraqi bonds. (Per data provided by Bernstein: "BarCap Municipal Custom HY Composite Yield to Worst. Current yield is 5.41%, tax-equivalent yield of 8.96% assuming 39.6% tax rate.") That spread implies that investors think Iraq is less likely to default than some U.S. municipalities. This fascinating stat, shared by Bernstein, highlights why high-yield municipal debt, or "munis," is what Bernstein calls the best investment opportunity anywhere in the world. "Everybody thinks every municipality is going bankrupt," Bernstein said at a recent breakfast attended by Business Insider. "It's just not true. We're going through a very normal cycle in municipal finance. An accentuated cycle, admittedly, but a normal cycle." Municipal defaults, which have been in the headlines in recent years following Detroit's bankruptcy and continued concerns over the health of Puerto Rico's finances, peaked two years ago, Bernstein said. Municipal defaults were partly triggered by pressure from declining tax revenues and underfunded pensions. Bernstein noted, however, that with U.S. 10-year Treasury bonds yielding 1.35%, which is where they were in summer 2012, "it would have been a miracle to see public pensions overfunded." But as the cycle turns, Bernstein said, and tax revenues increase, interest rates increase, and asset values in pensions funds increase, the financial health of municipalities will improve.  Municipal bonds can also offer investors another incentives, as interest earned from municipal bonds is often tax-exempt. Even leaving out this benefit, however, at least one adviser sees an obvious investment opportunity right here in America. FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Gary CameronGM CEO Mary BarraGiven that General Motors has recalled 30 million vehicles so far this year — twice as many cars and trucks as were sold in the entire U.S. in 2013 — the company's second-quarter earnings were reasonably stable, with just a slight miss on earnings. Ongoing recall issues have already cost GM over $2 billion, with maybe another billion still to come, so a big question in the auto industry is when this is going affect the carmaker's business. Maybe never, as GM is still making money, expanding globally, and holding the line on its U.S market share at around 17%. Even Europe, a nightmare for company since its bankruptcy, is starting to turn the corner. If there's one piece of the GM genetic code that survived the 2008-2009 Detroit meltdown, it's the ability of biggest of the Big Three to endure some absolutely hellacious hits. Unfortunately, another strand of Old GM DNA that's only now being modified is the company's ambivalent attitude toward safety. On GM's Q2 earning call today, CEO Mary Barra used the lion's share of her time to stress that the company has really and truly gotten religion when it comes to not killing people. This is admirable, and Barra has handled her trial by fire as Detroit's first female CEO about as well as could be expected, given the unprecedented nature of the recalls. But let's get real: When people buy cars, safety is pretty high on their list of concerns. Gone are the days when safety-obsessed consumers felt they had to purchase tank-like Volvos and Mercedes to avoid death or dismemberment. Even though more than 30,000 people are killed every year on American roads, you walk onto a dealer lot in 2014 thinking that even small cars have enough safety features to save your life in a crash. And according to a 2012 study by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, our expectations are backed up by the numbers. GM has a pretty good safety record these days, but it's bizarre to hear the CEO say, as Barra did, that GM won't be satisfied by solving its current problems — as if the only thing that can spur a corporate obsession with safety is a recall of epic proportions and few contrite visits by the CEO to Capitol Hill. Nor does it instill confidence in the GM brand to think that a 105-year-old company has finally gotten around to appointing a VP-level executive, Jeff Boyer, as Safety Czar. "We are dramatically enhancing our approach to safety," Barra told Wall Street analysts today. To which one wants to reply: It's about time. FREE AppDownload
Reuters/ Eric Thayer Barry RosensteinThe sale of the country’s most expensive residential property has resulted in a multimillion dollar lawsuit. Barry Rosenstein, founder of hedge fund Jana Partners, bought the mansion in East Hampton in May for $147 million. Now, brokerage Corcoran claims that it is owed $8.82 million in commission and damages after the firm was allegedly cut out of the deal. Corcoran maintains that it was hired as the broker to sell the property. Rosenstein bought the 18-acre, beachfront estate from its former owners Christopher Brown and Andrew Gordon. The lawsuit was filed on Wednesday in Suffolk County. According to the suit, Corcoran President Pam Liebman and broker, Tim Davis, met with the trustees of the estate in January. The suit alleges that they had exclusively been picked to market the property for $150 million. Rosenstein reportedly thought the price was too high and brokered a deal with the estate’s representatives. “This dispute is between the sellers of the property and a broker claiming to represent them. Mr. Rosenstein, as the buyer, should not be a party to the complaint and we are confident the court will see it that way as well,” according to a spokesperson for Rosenstein. [NYP] – Claire Moses FREE AppDownload
Bloomberg via Getty ImagesIt's hard to know when it happened. On Wall Street, dates and times tend to run together, especially when the market is as dead silent as it is now. Sometime, though, in between earnings announcements and investor conferences, CNBC appearances and M&amp;A deals, Bill Ackman of the hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management became what looks like the most oblivious man on Wall Street. This condition was on florid display on Tuesday, when the silver-haired billionaire held his third presentation on Herbalife, a multi-level marketing nutrition firm that he announced he would short to zero back in December 2012. What happened after that initial grandiose display is already the stuff of Wall Street legend. After Ackman announced his position at a well-attended public presentation in the auditorium of the AXA Equitable Building — a circus of journalists and investors that ran heavy on Ackman’s customary pomp and circumstance — Herbalife's stock fell. Whether the decline was due to Ackman’s allegations that the company was a pyramid scheme that exploited the dreams of its mostly Latino salespeople or to the market’s herd mentality was unclear. But for a minute there, Citizen Bill looked like the biggest hero on the street — a billion-dollar whiz kid who had figured out how to do well for himself while striking a blow for the little guy. In the post-Occupy era, when big-time financiers are all too conscious of the public perception that their work fattens the balance sheets of the 1% at the expense of everyone else, it was a pretty nifty trick. Even now his investors must be happy. Herbalife isn't his only position. His fund, Pershing Square, is killing it this year, up 25% in the first half. It is Ackman's public face that tends to make Wall Street want to turn away. Weeks after he announced his Herbalife short, a buyer stepped in. Carl Icahn, long one of Ackman's enemies, put his nemesis in a short squeeze. Moreover, Icahn answered Ackman's public short with a dramatic display of his own. He called into CNBC while Ackman was on the air, and the two got into it on live television. "I'm telling you he's like a crybaby in the schoolyard,” Icahn said. “I went to a tough school in Queens, you know, and they used to beat up the little Jewish boys. He was like one of the little Jewish boys crying ..." Ackman could only shake his head at Icahn’s antics and go on to explain the root of their quarrel. Icahn was colorful, yes, but in that instance, Ackman looked like the adult in the room. Even so, everyone who showed up for Ackman’s Tuesday presentation — or tuned into the internet livestream — remembered what Icahn said on TV over a year before. They remembered it as Ackman’s talk passed the hour mark, then the two-hour mark and the three-hour mark. They remembered it as Ackman compared Herbalife's top brass to everything from Nazis to Mafiosos and drug dealers. And they remembered it as they watched Herbalife's stock rocket up 24% for the day, making a mockery of Ackman's crusade. They remembered it when Ackman — describing his family’s connection to the American Dream as the presentation (almost) neared its climax — actually cried. Wall Street is a macho place. Traders are taught to keep their emotions in check. Irrational exuberance might be fun down at Chuck E. Cheese — in the canyons of finance it’s deadly. And breaking down in tears is even worse. No investor wants someone prone to hysterics running their money. The market punishes vulnerability, and on Tuesday evening, at dinners from the Upper East Side to Newport, California, people wondered: What the heck happened to Bill Ackman? CNBC Since the financial crisis, Ackman’s name has has been high up on the list of those who "saw it coming" with his short of insurer MBIA. For some time, that was a mystical phrase in the post-crisis era — it drew money to your hedge fund, created confidence in your investors. These days, however, Ackman seems like that overeager kid you knew in high school. The one who ran for class president over and over again, got beat every time, and never understood why. His Herbalife short is all that adolescent desperation crystallized into a single high-profile trade. To win, he must persuade regulators and politicians to look at the 34-year-old, $6.4 billion market cap company and see what he sees — an illegal pyramid scheme built on the backs of its army of distributors, mostly low-income Latino immigrants, trying to chase a small slice of the American dream. At Tuesday's presentation, Ackman mentioned the media's treatment of that D.C. crusade, specifically referencing a January New York Times article suggesting that Ackman had been directly involved in Senator Edward Markey's (D-Mass.) condemnation of the company. See, while regulators like the Securities Exchange Commission and the Federal Trade Commission have been looking into the matter, not many politicians have been jumping into the ring. "Under financial pressure as the stock rose," the article said, "Mr. Ackman made the rounds among regulators, meeting with the S.E.C., the F.T.C., and the office of the New York attorney general, in a quest to discredit the company. He released reams of documents, whose points were echoed in Mr. Markey’s letters on Thursday." Ackman flayed the media in general for their coverage of Herbalife, but he took issue with the The Times specifically for even conceiving that he might have had something to do with Markey’s letter. It’s standard operating procedure in Congress for legislators call for action or even craft bills based on research or policy work provided by lobbyists or other constituents. But being called out on it is never a good thing. "Ironically, I think Ackman’s involvement has made it much harder for members of Congress to raise the heat on this," a Hill staffer told Business Insider. "Some will weigh in for one side or another, but most want to avoid appearing like they’re doing one billionaire’s bidding. What do they have to gain?" It's just one example of Ackman's apparent lack of self-awareness. Tuesday's presentation was meant to be a study of Herbalife, but it turned into a study of Ackman's character. That's what it felt like when Ackman took a detour in his presentation to accuse Chapman Capital's Bob Chapman of self-promotion for daring to appear on CNBC to discuss his firm's long position in Herbalife while Ackman was still pontificating. Think about it: Here’s a guy standing on stage giving a three-and-a-half-hour presentation on one trade accusing another investor of seeking the spotlight. Ackman, a tireless performer, has somehow convinced himself no one is paying close attention to the show. All anyone could think was: Really, dude? Perhaps Ackman would have liked Chapman to choose another day — any day other than his big day — to rip a few of the "Ackman For Junior Class President" fliers off the halls of The Street. But let's call that a simple gaffe, because eventually Ackman's hysterics ventured into more questionable territory. Sometime in the second, or maybe (who knows?) third, hour of the presentation, Ackman said that former D.A. Davidson food and beverage analyst Tim Ramey may have been fired for his bullish position on Herbalife. Ramey was furious. He had, in fact, left D.A. Davidson on good terms to take a job with Post Foods. He said as much to Ackman, and to CNBC's Scott Wapner, in an e-mail that turned into the story of the afternoon. "Exposing one lie is the same as exposing 1,000 lies," Ramey wrote. "[Ackman] can't discern the difference anymore between truth and his fictional view of events." Ackman was forced to retract his statement. Bloomberg via Getty Images Unfortunately, this is not the first time Ackman appears to have spoken carelessly in his effort to substantiate his position in a trade. On June 9, he appeared on CNBC to discuss his position in the pharmaceutical firm Allergan — it’s a purchase he made to push the company to accept a hostile takeover by its peer, Valeant. At this point it's well known that short seller Jim Chanos, of Kynikos Associates, thinks that Valeant is an accounting rollup, that it lacks real growth. Such claims, coming from Wall Street’s foremost short seller, are hard to ignore. So Ackman addressed them during his CNBC appearance, but some of the points he made were just plain wrong. "Here's what Jim's missing," Ackman told CNBC's Becky Quick. "Since I disclosed our stake in Valeant, I picked up the phone, I left him two messages, I asked him to come on the show this morning. Your producer did the same ... By the way, Jim has covered his Valeant short by buying Allergan. If he really believes that Valeant was a bad company going to zero — he's effectively a risk arb at this point. He's bought Allergan, he's short Valeant. He makes money. What he's saying is that if this deal goes through, Valeant is worth a lot more money." The problem is that Chanos says he never covered his Valeant short — he added to it. He has a very small long position in Allergan in his long-short hedge fund, but it is only a fraction of his Valeant short position. Chanos also maintains that he has no record of any phone messages, voicemails, or emails from Mr. Ackman between mid-March and mid-May, which was after his April 22 announcement that he had purchased Allergan shares. In that same appearance, Ackman said that Chanos was short Danaher, a manufacturing company. Chanos told Business Insider, however, that he has not shorted the company for over a decade. "I have no idea where he came up with that,” Mr. Chanos said.  The sad part about all of this — the shows, the exaggerations, the public emotion — is that Ackman could be right about Herbalife. He could be right, but no Washington politician wants to appear to be bullied by a billionaire. He could be right, but no one on Wall Street wants to listen to an investor who gives emotional three-hour sermons about trading positions. He could be right, but when he says misleading things on television, it’s hard not to question his integrity. Earlier this month at CNBC’s Delivering Alpha conference, Ackman took the stage during Carl Icahn’s closing interview. They shared an awkward hug and pretended to be friends. The man who once called Ackman “sanctimonious” and criticized his penchant for going public, asserted that they had called a truce. But for how long? A friendship based on a truce is one that can turn on a dime. As a major holder of Herbalife stock, Icahn has to file within 48 hours when he buys or sells. The whispers at dinner Tuesday night were that he had purchased the stock, driving up the price, but who really knows. But that said, oblivious people tend to have a lot of enemies — ones who aren’t always public but are always waiting for them to compulsively put themselves within firing range. Which they inevitably do; that’s what makes them so oblivious. And then, all their enemies have to do is shoot. FREE AppDownload
YouTube/SodaStreamSodaStream is said to be in talks with an investment firm to go private, reports Bloomberg. Following the report shares of SodaStream were up as much as 18%. Bloomberg's David Wainer and Manuel Baigorri, citing people familiar with the matter, report that the deal could value the at-home soda maker at about $40 per share.  SodaStream, which is one of the most heavily shorted stocks in the market with about 33% of the stock's float currently held short, according to data from FinViz, has been one of the market's most volatile stocks in recent years. In February, after Coca-Cola announced a deal to take a 10% stake in Keurig, SodaStream shares plummeted.  Earlier this year, an April report from Israeli financial publication Calcalist said Pepsi was in talks to take a stake in the company. And since Coke took a stake in Keurig — and announced plans to develop a brewing system to brew cold drinks at home — many in the market have speculated that Pepsi could be a natural partner for SodaStream, though nothing official has emerged to date.   FREE AppDownload
Wikimedia CommonsSpiral viaduct near Brusio, Switzerland.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) just cut its forecast for global GDP growth in 2014 to 3.4% from 3.6%. "Global growth could be weaker for longer, given the lack of robust momentum in advanced economies," they said via Bloomberg. "Monetary policy should thus remain accomodative in all major advanced economies." Among the biggest revisions was U.S. 2014 GDP growth, which was cut to 1.7% from an earlier forecast of 2.8%. The organization expects the Euro area to expand 1.1%, and Japan to gain 1.5%. They do, however, expect global growth to accelerate to 4.0% in 2015. Construction and mining machinery giant Caterpillar offered its own growth forecasts earlier today. "We anticipate global economic growth in 2014 of about 2.5 percent, a modest improvement from 2013 levels," said Caterpillar. "Most developed countries continue to pursue pro-growth policies, which should continue to benefit those economies. However, many developing countries have raised interest rates and in many of those countries rates are near the peak reached in 2011." FREE AppDownload
BI IntelligenceVenmo's growth shows what kind of opportunity exists in the P2P payment space. It's expected to process more than $1 billion annually.Mobile peer-to-peer payment apps, which let people send money to one another instantly, are gaining rapid adoption in the U.S. and globally. Venmo, for example, is now processing at a run-rate of $1.6 billion in volume, according to BI Intelligence estimates. The secret to the success of these apps is that they solve a real problem for users: They give them a way to pay each other when they don't have cash or a check. For example, if you go out to dinner these apps make it easy to pay a friend back for covering the cost of your meal. In fact, among U.S. adults who use P2P payment apps, 49% say they use them for dining-related transactions, according to Nielsen. In a new report from BI Intelligence we size the opportunity for mobile P2P transactions, take a high-level look at a handful of these apps and how they work, what the opportunities are for monetization, and explore how P2P payments could be the bridge to consumer uptake of mobile payments.

Wikimedia CommonsThe garage where Hewlett-Packard was foundedAll of these renowned companies have proven that success truly depends on determination, faith, and hard work. No matter where you start your business or how much money you originally put into it, passion, commitment, and courage are often all you need to make your company a success. But in case you need some objective proof or further convincing, here are some of the biggest companies in the world, all of which were started in their founders' garages. Yes, the world's most famous search engine, "Google" was actually started in a garage. Larry Page and Sergey Brin, graduates from Stanford University, rented a garage from a friend, Susan Wojcicki, in September of 1998. They worked day and night for a number of months and developed what would be known as Google. Their main goal while creating the website was to organize and maintain all kinds of information on a single platform that would be accessible to common people all over the world. Today, Google is the most commonly used search engine in the world and has also launched other useful websites and applications for their customers like Gmail, Google+, and Google Drive. Apple is another insanely popular international brand, but few people actually realize that it was also originated in a garage in California by three young men. Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne developed the first Apple in computer in 1976 in the garage of Steve Jobs' parents house. The Apple I computer was sold as a motherboard to a local store for $500 and shortly thereafter, the team continued on to created the Apple II computer. Their products and company became famous when they got a break from their Macintosh line of products, from which they earned millions of dollars. Now, Apple is leading a technological revolution with their various devices including cutting edge Mac computers, iPhone, iPod, and iPad. Every computer user knows the Microsoft brand. It's the remarkable and famous software that was once created in a small Albuquerque garage by Bill Gates and his friend Paul Allen. Both of them gave more importance to programming language and software operations and worked in collaboration with IBM. They got their first operating system licensed for $80,000. They kept working hard and some years later they developed their most impressive and exceptional operating system called "Windows." Today, Windows is the most widely used software all over the world and about 80% of computers, worldwide, are running this operating system. Amazon.com is a well known website for online shopping that was created in 1994 as an online bookstore by Jeff Bezos. He created the website in his garage in Washington, originally investing nearly $40,000 to enable him to order, sell, and deliver books to 48 different countries. He succeeded in selling his first book in July 1995, and since then he has grown the Amazon empire into the largest online shopping store in world. Walt and Roy Disney created their first films in their uncle's garage in 1923. They started their career by creating "Alice Comedies," which was actually a part of the original Alice in Wonderland animation series. Disney faced a lot of hardships in the journey towards success and was only accepted by investors after enduring plenty of struggle and strife. Now, Disney one of the most popular and highest earning media houses and franchises in the world and is the leading name in producing cartoons, children movies, and animated movies. Two friends, Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, founded HP in Packard's garage in 1939 with an initial investment of only $538. The product that eventually boosted their career was an audio oscillator (HP200A), which was sold to Walt Disney to improve their sound system for the movie, Fantasia. Walt Disney bought eight oscillators and gave them the biggest break of their life. Today, the Packard's garage in Palo Alto is famous as the birthplace of HP and Silicon Valley. Since its inception, HP has developed into a powerful and active company that is developing various computers, laptops, and other computer-centric accessories with advanced technologies. All of these companies started with little investment capital and a small workspace, but their hard work and unwavering dedication lead them to huge success. With same type of passion and determination, you too could be the founder of the next $25b+ enterprise. FREE AppDownload
The California Public Employees' Retirement System (Calpers), one of the largest pension funds in the United States, has decided to drop its investment in hedge funds by 40% (or down to $3 billion) this year, says the WSJ. The "why?" here is pretty simple — these pension funds think hedge fund fees are too expensive. And it isn't just Calpers. The School Employees Retirement System of Ohio decided to lower its hedge fund investment from 15% to 10% in 2015; New Jersey's State Investment Council lowered its investment from 12.25% to 12%; and San Francisco Employees' Retirement System is debating a cut as well. For now it's just trickle compared to hedge fund inflows, but these allocation decisions matter — especially from pensions like Calpers, which is a leader in the industry because of its sheer size. A Calpers spokesperson said the pension fund was taking a more "back to basics" approach to its investments. Here's what that means — until 2004 pensions were mostly involved in plain vanilla investments. Hungry for returns, however, they were willing to take on the higher fees in the hedge fund world. Now those fees are proving to be too much for too little. From the WSJ: With many hedge funds...outperformance hasn't materialized in recent years: Average public-pension gains from hedge funds were 3.6% for the three years ended March 31 as compared with a 10.9% return from private-equity investments, a 10.6% return from stocks and 5.7% from fixed-income investments, according to a Wilshire review of public pensions with more than $1 billion in assets. It worth noting that allocations to private equity are still climbing. For more on this, head to the WSJ&gt; FREE AppDownload
We keep hearing about "tax inversions."  A tax inversion is a corporate merger strategy that involves a company based in one country, say the U.S., acquiring another company based somewhere else, say the U.K., and following the deal moves its tax base to enjoy a lower corporate tax rate.  This year, some notable tax inversions, or proposed tax inversions, include Minnesota-based Medtronic's $43 billion deal to acquire Covidien and move its tax base to Ireland; Illinois-based AbbVie's $53 billion deal to acquire Shire and move its tax base to Jersey, an island in the English Channel; and New York-based Pfizer's failed attempt to acquire U.K.-based AstraZeneca. Pfizer's deal to acquire AstraZeneca, which was withdrawn in May, would've been the biggest of these mergers, with the deal totaling $120 billion. A report in The New York Times this morning said that the Obama administration is continuing to push for legislation that could retroactively strip the tax advantages achieved by companies in some of this year's deals. And so it seems that both Congress and Wall Street have taken notice of this loophole, and one look at this chart from Goldman Sachs says it all. Goldman Sachs FREE AppDownload
ReutersWal-Mart's top American executive, Bill Simon, is leaving the company.  Simon's sudden departure comes at a "very, very odd time," and speaks to larger trends in the economy, said Brian Sozzi, chief equities strategist at Belus Capital Advisors.  "A decision to replace a high-ranking leader of a major retailer BEFORE back to school and BEFORE holidays is no laughing matter, and speaks volumes as to the current trends in the U.S. business," Sozzi said in a note to clients.  Bill Simon will be replaced by Gregory Faran, who currently runs the retail business in Asia.  Earlier this month, Simon told Reuters that the U.S. job rebound wasn't translating to better sales at Wal-Mart.  "It's really hard to see in our business today that it's gotten any better," Simon told Reuters.  "We’ve reached a point where it’s not getting any better but it’s not getting any worse – at least for the middle (class) and down," Simon said.  Same-store sales at Wal-Mart's U.S. stores have fallen for five straight quarters.  Other retailers in the discount sector have also struggled with the weak U.S. consumer.  Family Dollar CEO Howard Levine offered analysts an ominous insight about his customers in a presentation earlier this month.  "The low end consumer has not benefited in this recovery at all in fact I think (they) have slipped further back," Levine said.

REUTERS/Thomas PeterSoldiers of the 209th corp of the Afghan army (ANA) roll up the red carpet after a visit by German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen (not pictured) at Camp Shaheen outside Mazar-i-Sharif.Stocks finished mixed, but little changed, after economic data early in the session was mixed and a flood of corporate earnings again poured in. By virtue of a higher close, the S&amp;P 500 made yet another all-time high. First, the scoreboard: And now, the scoreboard: 1) This morning, weekly initial jobless claims data came in way better than expected, as 284,000 individuals filed for unemployment, down from 302,000 last week and lower than the 307,000 that was expected by economists. This reading was the lowest number for the index since February 2006. Following the report, Neil Dutta at Renaissance Macro said that the underlying trend in weekly claims remains healthy, but noted that this data, "likely informs more about production than employment." 2) Markit's preliminary U.S. PMI reading came in at 56.3, worse than last month's 57.3 and below the 57.4 that was expected by economists. The report also indicated that job creation was the weakest since September 2013, but Markit's Chris Williamson said recent data remains strong. "U.S. manufacturers are enjoying a summer of scorching growth," Williamson said. "Output grew in July at a rate only just below the four-year peak seen in June as inflows of new orders surged higher again. The data suggest the sector is growing at an annualized rate of roughly 8% as we moved into the second half of the year. The growth rebound that the survey has signaled for the second quarter therefore looks to have been sustained into the third quarter." 3) Housing data also disappointed, as new home sales fell 8.1% in June to an annualized rate of 406,000, worse than the 5.8% decline expected by economists. Following the report, Michael Gapen at Barclays said, "The June decline plus revision to May have erased the rebound in Q2 new homes sales that we had expected... Altogether, this is a much softer report than expected and suggests housing demand has stabilized in recent quarter, as opposed to improving." 4) It was a tough day for traders betting against Zillow or SodaStream, as shares of both companies soared following possible deal reports from Bloomberg. Zillow shares gained more than 15% after Bloomberg said the company is seeking to acquire online real estate rival Trulia. Following the report, Trulia shares gained nearly 32%. SodaStream shares also surged, gaining about 10% after Bloomberg reported the company is in talks with a private investment company to go private.  5) The International Monetary Fund, or IMF, cut its global GDP forecast to 3.4% from 3.6%, with the organization saying that, "Global growth could be weaker for longer, given the lack of robust momentum in advanced economies." Among the biggest cuts was the IMF's slashing of 2014 U.S. GDP growth, to 1.7% from 2.8%.  6) After last night reporting better than expected profit and revenue, Facebook shares made a new all-time high, closing at $74.98. 7) Among notable companies reporting earnings before the market open were Caterpillar, which reported better than expected results but saw shares fall more than 3%, and General Motors, which took a $900 million charge on potential future recalls and saw shares fall nearly 5%.  8) Notable earnings reports expected after the market close include Amazon, Visa, and Starbucks.  Don't Miss: 30 Stocks Traders Are Shorting Like Crazy » FREE AppDownload

Markit's initial reading of U.S. manufacturing data for July came in at 56.3. Expectations were for a reading of 57.5, up from a prior reading of 57.3. Job creation was the weakest since September 2013. "Cost burdens" were up on higher raw materials prices, especially metals.   But Markit economist Chris Williamson says recent data remain strong: US manufacturers are enjoying a summer of scorching growth. Output grew in July at a rate only just below the four-year peak seen in June as inflows of new orders surged higher again. The data suggest the sector is growing at an annualised rate of roughly 8% as we moved into the second half of the year.  The growth rebound that the survey has signalled for the second quarter therefore looks to have been sustained into the third quarter. Factories were able to raise their prices to the greatest extent seen so far this year as a result of the improvement in demand, suggesting there may some inflationary pressures building in the manufacturing supply chain.   But some items give him pause: Worryingly, job creation slid to its lowest since last September, which in part reflects concerns that current sales growth may not be sustained. A key source of concern is export sales, which continue to show disappointingly meagre gains. Here's are the charts: Markit FREE AppDownload

CNBC/ Heidi GutmanHedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin has filed for divorce from his wife, Anne Dias-Griffin.  His wife's attorney told the Chicago Tribune in a statement that Griffin filed while she was on summer vacation with the kids.  "Ken Griffin unilaterally filed a divorce petition today with no notice to either me or my client, knowing full well that she had just left for summer vacation with their three young children and would therefore be unable to respond. Anne's highest priority remains her family, especially the well-being of her children. She is hopeful that this personal matter can be resolved privately and in the best interests of her children. We have no further comment at this time." Ken Griffin is the founder of Chicago-based hedge fund giant Citadel LLC. The 45-year-old hedge fund manager has an estimated net worth of $5.5 billion, according to Forbes.  Dias-Griffin, who was born in France, is the founder of hedge fund firm Aragon Global Management.  The pair of hedge funders were married in Versailles in 2003.  This is the second divorce for Griffin. He divorced his first wife in 1994. Here's an image of Dias-Griffin.  YouTube screenshot FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Mark BlinchWe just learned initial jobless claims plunged to 284,000, their lowest level since 2006. Unfortunately, the data really does not tell us that much about the true health of the jobs market. That's because July is traditionally a time when automakers shut down their plants for retooling. According to Renaissance Macro's Neil Dutta, with auto sales surging, the figure instead says more about productivity. He writes:  Today's jobless claims data likely informs us more about production than employment. The unexpected decline to 284,000, the lowest since 2006, reflects the fact that U.S. auto production is in overdrive at a time when factories are normally shut down to retool for new makes and models. We would expect a significant pick-up in motor vehicle production and manufacturing employment in July.  That said, the underlying trend remains healthy, Dutta says.  "The four-week moving average, which removes some of the 'noise,' continues to descend, falling to 302,000, a fresh cycle low. So, the underlying trend in firings remains low." Barclays is saying the same thing: the data is too noisy to be fully trusted, but we are definitely heading in the right direction.  ...mid-summer is the time of the annual auto industry shutdown for retooling of auto production plants. The timing of this process has been altered in recent years with some retooling being forgone altogether or shortened relative to previous cycles. As such, MNI reported that a Labor Department spokesman said that the month of July is usually volatile as a result of the retooling process and inability of seasonal adjustment factors to fully account for this process. As a result, we prefer to focus on the four-week moving average in initial claims, which suggest that the gradual improvement in labor market conditions continues. We look to subsequent reports to see if this week’s claims data were mainly driven by volatility in annual auto production retooling, as we suspect, or whether they reflect an acceleration in the pace of job market improvement. Yields on the U.S. 10-year note were up three points after the report.  FREE AppDownload

A new ratings report issued by Moodys claims that Metinvest is benefitting from “the company’s ability to generate positive cash flows even in times of a severe downturn as observed in 2009 and more recently; (2) low leverage; (3) high degree of vertical integration; (4) large iron ore reserves; and (5) the geographically advantageous location of some of its major assets.” Exactly what advantage the geography of eastern Ukraine is conferring on Akhmetov’s business Moody’s analysts don’t say.The worst Moodys can think of in the short term for Akhmetov is that “downward pressure could be exerted on Metinvest’s rating as a result of a further potential downgrade of the sovereign rating and/or further lowering of the foreign-currency bond country ceiling.” The Moodys report was issued on April 10. The good news has continued to stream in from the, er, eastern front. In the June quarter, Metinvest announced on July 18, crude steel output was up 8% on the March quarter, and iron-ore concentrate grew by 4% over the same interval. The first-half results weren’t as good, by comparison with a year ago – steel production down 8%, iron-ore concentrate down 3%, raw coking coal down 21%. The only cloud in the sky, according to the company report, was snow — “adverse weather conditions, which led to railcar bottlenecks due to snow on the tracks. In April-May, the enterprises stabilised production, compensating for the drop in the previous quarter.” The word “war” doesn’t appear in the company’s paperwork. Instead, the decrease of steel production at the Yenakiieve mill – located 40 kilometres northeast of Donetsk, in separatist or contested territory – has been explained by “a major overhaul of blast furnace no. 3. In turn, this and a major overhaul of basic oxygen furnace no. 1 in May-June 2014 caused steel output to fall by 56 thousand tonnes.” What was lost at Yenakiive, Akhmetov’s accountants claim, was made up for by production growth at the Azovstal and Ilyich Steel mills, both located at the port city of Mariupol, 140 kilometres due south of Donetsk. In the second, Akhmetov mobilized his men to protect the mill from formations of Ukrainian separatists. “Thousands of steelworkers,” Metinvest claimed on May 16, “fanned out on Thursday through the city of Mariupol, establishing control over the streets and banishing the pro-Kremlin militants who until recently had seemed to be consolidating their grip on power, dealing a setback to Russia and possibly reversing the momentum in eastern Ukraine.” Local press reports put the number in the hundreds. According to a separate report on the financial performance pof Akhmetov’s steelmills, issued for the first quarter in May, sales revenues slipped in the period to $2.9 billion; that was down 8% compared to the March quarter of 2013. However, earnings (Ebitda) jumped 91% to $878 million. Not only doesn’t the Ukrainian war feature in this performance; but the Russian market is also invisible. The sales revenue number declined, the company says, because Metinvest’s domestic market, accounting for more than a quarter of sales, contracted. “Revenues in Ukraine totalled US$736 million in 1Q 2014, down 11% y-o-y. Despite steady sales of iron ore products on the domestic market, sales of steel products declined amid lower demand in the major steel consuming sectors (construction, machine-building and pipeline infrastructure).” On the other hand, export sales compensated slightly, rising 1% year on year. War proved to be good for business, at least in Iraq, Syria, Egypt, and Libya. “The proportion of sales to the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) rose by 6 pp y-o-y to 20%, driven by greater volumes of semifinished and flat products. The share of sales to the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS, excluding Ukraine) was down 4 pp to 7% due to lower volumes of finished steel products, mainly to Russia.” The Russian market comprised 11% of Akhmetov’s export sales in 2013; it was down to 7% by March of this year. Export sales to Europe were four times more valuable, and they have been growing by 1%. On the earnings front, Akhmetov did particularly well out of the overthrow of President Victor Yanukovich’s government in February, and the dramatic cut in the costs of his production which has followed, as the exchange value of the hryvnia collapsed. “The rise in consolidated EBITDA was primarily attributable to hryvnia devaluation, which added US$301 million y-o-y to the total. Other key drivers of EBITDA growth were: falling market prices for coking coal, scrap metals and ferroalloys, which reduced costs by US$52 million overall; lower gas consumption due to the launch of PCI at Ilyich Steel, a fall in gas price y-o-y and the optimisation of temperatures in metallurgical processes, which brought savings of US$54 million overall; [and] lower distribution costs of US$12 million due to decreases in railway tariffs following the hryvnia devaluation.” Metinvest is registered in The Netherlands. It is owned through Cyprus entities, and it trades through a wholly-owned entity called Metinvest International S.A. which is registered in Switzerland. Akhmetov’s Ukrainian cashflow is thus subject to Swiss Government regulation. Another trading entity called Metinvest Eurasia is identified in the company’s bond prospectuses as responsible for sales to Russia, Belarus and other CIS states. Metinvest’s investment relations spokesman, Andrei Bondarenko, based at an office in Geneva, refuses to say where Metinvest Eurasia is registered to pay tax. Metinvest press and investment relations contact numbers in Kiev ring without answer, and there is no response by the company to emailed questions. Akhmetov owns 71.24% of the Metinvest shares. A 5% shareholding is held by Clarendale Limited, a vehicle of the former owners of Ilyich Steel. The second major stake of 23.76% belongs to Vadim Novinsky’s SMART group. Novinsky, an ethnic Russian, is doing less well out of the war. Days after the February 21 political change in Kiev, the National Bank of Ukraine put his Forum Bank into bankruptcy administration. Akhmetov’s First Ukrainian International Bank (FUIB in English, PUMB in Russian) is alive and kicking. Its releases for the first quarter this year claim its assets have grown modestly in value, while its income has jumped ahead of its impairments and write-offs. The Akhmetov bank profit to March 31 was the equivalent of $17 million; that’s 42% better than it was before the Troubles, a year ago. This result was achieved with very little cash from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) – a fraction of the receipts of rivals Privatbank (Igor Kolomoisky), Delta Bank (Cargill of the US), Finance &amp; Credit (Konstantin Zhevago), Brokbiznesbank (Sergei Kurchenko), and Vizavi Bank (Vitaliy Gayduk, Sergei Levochkin, and Sergei Taruta). This week, on July 21, the war finally caught up with Akhmetov’s business when artillery struck the Avdiivka Coke Plant, setting it on fire for several hours. A Metinvestannouncement avoided identifying the source of the bombardment. A BBC news bulletin claimed the incendiaries were fired by the Ukrainian military. johnhelmer.netRed = steel, iron, coal, and coke plants – Avdiivka is no.9; Azovstal no. 1; Ilyich no. 2; Yenakiieve, no. 3Blue = ports, including Mariupol no. 6Source: Annual Report 2013 – page 13 Even if Akhmetov’s steel and bank financial reports omit to report the impact of the eastern Ukraine conflict, and the Moody’s report passes over war risk, holders of Metinvest’s 2018 $750 million bonds, which are traded on the Berlin Stock Exchange, are not so sanguine. From near-par value at the start of the year, the traded value of the paper has fallen by 17%. johnhelmer.netSource: http://www.boerse-berlin.com/ By contrast, the 2015 $500 million bond, traded on the Irish Stock Exchange, has been more stable in market value, although the exchange does not release current prices. The Dragon Capital chart for the bond shows the yield to maturity improving steadily since the start of this year. Akhmetov is also benefiting from the failure of domestic, Russian, or international analysts to look closely at the impact of the international aid programmes for Ukraine, which started in May. Moodys, for example, has ignored the costs side of Metinvest’s business, despite the obvious growth in costs which are part of the conditions accompanying the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) $17 billion Stand-By Agreement. Gas, previously identified as about 11% of the costs of production and sales, should be rising sharply. Action against Akhmetov’s subsidiaries for failing to pay their gas arrears has been reported this month in the Ukrainian press. The IMF papers do not mention Metinvest, Akhmetov, or individual mills and proprietors by name. The IMF conditions for funding the Ukrainian state budget and banking system include an immediate 40% increase in the gas tariff, followed by the collection of gas payment arrears which have accumulated to the benefit of industrial users like Metinvest. Related-party lending between the steelmills, coal and iron-ore mines of Metinvest and Akhmetov’s PUMB should already be undergoing scrutiny by independent auditors, supervised by the IMF. The objective of the Fund’s stress testing is to “gaug[e] the strength of bank balance sheets, and …the best course of action to address any weaknesses. In particular, the asset valuation exercise aims to ensure that loan provisions reflect rigorous implementation of NBU loan classification and provisioning rules, so their true financial condition and capitalization is not distorted.” In an investor presentation this past April, Metinvest said its debts totalled $4.3 billion as of December 31, 2013. Debt repayment appears manageable this year, but a major refinancing will be required by next year. johnhelmer.netInternational banking sources express more scepticism of Akhmetov’s financial capacity than his financial presentations and the Moodys rating report suggest. The sources note that Metinvest recently declared a dividend for 2013, enabling Akhmetov and Novinsky to help themselves to a payout of $400 million from the 2013 balance-sheet, even though bottom-line profit was $392 million. Related-party disclosures in the financial report for that year show that 9% of Metoinvest sales go to related parties; 34% of costs come from related-party purchasing. How much borrowing and debt securitization are based on related parties has not been disclosed. The bank sources add that in the civil war conditions now prevailing in eastern Ukraine, it is far from certain Akhmetov can continue adding profits, and avoiding losses. A notice from auditors PriceWaterhouseCoopers, dated March 28, claims “the operations of the Group, and those of other entities in Ukraine, have been affected and may continue to be affected for the foreseeable future by the continuing political and economic uncertainties in Ukraine. Our opinion is not qualified in respect of this matter.” Steel industry sources say they don’t know what this means. Western and Russian sources say they are counting on the IMF to investigate the relationship between Akhmetov’s bank and Metinvest’s units in order to assess Akhmetov’s vulnerabilities. Ukrainian steel sources say that Akhmetov has few assets exposed in a combat zone. The main plants, they say, are working normally. The picture for Metinvest’s coal mines is less optimistic. Local press reports from the Donetsk and Lugansk regions indicate that several mines have been forced to close, and production was sharply curtailed in June. Miners going to their jobs have come under attack this month, and have stopped work. This article originally appeared at Dances With Bears.

Flickr via Kansas City DistrictCaterpillar just announced Q2 earnings that beat expectations, and announced a big stock buyback. This could be good news for the whole economy. As a global supplier of construction and mining equipment, Caterpillar is a bellwether of economic activity. Every quarter, management provides an overview of the economy based on what they see. Here are some of the key 2014 forecasts: Here's the whole outlook: 2014 Outlook Economic OutlookWe anticipate global economic growth in 2014 of about 2.5 percent, a modest improvement from 2013 levels. Most developed countries continue to pursue pro-growth policies, which should continue to benefit those economies. However, many developing countries have raised interest rates and in many of those countries rates are near the peak reached in 2011. At that time, higher rates slowed those economies, and similar problems are occurring now. Our economic outlook assumes that developed economies will continue to improve while developing economies will remain challenged. We expect global economic growth in 2014 to be sufficient to increase demand for mined commodities and energy, keeping commodity prices at levels that support production. Mining company profits improved in 2013, and increased production and cost cutting should support further improvement. While most commodity prices should remain high enough to make investments attractive, we expect companies will continue to be cautious about resuming equipment investments, and we expect mining capital expenditures in 2014 to be below 2013.

AP Photo/Paul SakumaOn Wednesday night, Gilead Sciences reported earnings and revenue that crushed expectations as sales of its "wonder drug" Sovaldi continued to boom. Gilead reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.36, beating expectations for $1.79, on revenue of $6.53 billion, which topped expectations for $5.91 billion. Sales of the company's hepatitis C drug Sovaldi, which CNBC's Jim Cramer once called a "wonder drug," totaled $3.48 billion, beating expectations for $2.98 billion.  For some perspective on just how bonkers Gilead's sales have gone since Sovaldi was approved in December 2013, last year the company's Q2 net product sales totaled $2.3 billion, or about $1.2 billion less than Sovaldi's sales alone this quarter.  In the company's earnings release, Gilead CEO John Martin said: "Since December's launch, Sovaldi has been prescribed for more than 80,000 patients in the U.S. and Europe, underscoring the medical community's recognition of the benefits of this product." Gilead also boosted its full year product sales view substantially, saying it now sees full-year product sales of $21 billion to $23 billion, compared with its prior outlook of $11.3 billion to $11.5 billion.  The company reiterated its earnings per share outlook of $0.63 to $0.66. During the second quarter, Gilead generated $4.19 billion in operating cash flow, and the company used $1.2 billion to repurchase 15.2 million shares during the quarter. Since the company's Q1 earnings report on April 22, shares of Gilead were up about 24%, and in pre-market trading the shares were up 1.1%.  FREE AppDownload
APFacebook delivered an incredible second quarter earnings report.  It destroyed expectations on the top and bottom lines, posting strong growth across the board.  The stock is up 9% in pre-market trading to $77.70, a new all-time high.  After looking at the earnings report, there are two things that stand out above the rest.  1. Facebook's user growth is astounding. Even with over a billion current users, Facebook gained 40 million monthly active users on a sequential basis. On a year-over-year basis, it gained 162 million users, a 14% gain.  If any startup, or app was gaining 41 million new users on a quarterly basis, the tech world would be freaking out. The reaction to Facebook gaining all those users is pretty muted.  Again, this is a company with 1.3 billion users, and it's still growing like crazy.  2. Facebook has so many revenue opportunities ahead of it. Facebook hasn't even really started to sell ads in Instagram. When it decides to do that, that's another massive advertising revenue stream.  WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger are giant products that have not yet been monetized. If Facebook can unlock some sort of new business model, that's another big business line.  Facebook search has potential. This is a long shot, but if Facebook can improve its search engine and get people to actually use it, there's revenue potential.  Oculus VR is a long term bet. Right now it's a gaming device. In the long run it could be a platform for much, much more. Virtual Reality has the potential to take people around the world from their homes. It can be used to train and teach people. Even if it's just a gaming device, that's got potential to be a healthy business. Ben Schachter at Macquarie Research says of these various opportunities, "In our view, most of these businesses have the potential to be as large or larger than FB’s current advertising business. And while the company emphasized that it is taking a long-term approach to each, we think that any progress will highlight the potential to investors." FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Albert GeaFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg smiles as he arrives at the stage to deliver a keynote speech during the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona on Feb. 24. Earlier this week, Facebook reported its Q2 earnings, and it was a huge result on all fronts. The earnings call solidifies Zuckerberg's net worth at about $31.5 billion, given the 422,954,082 shares the 30-year-old owns.  So, there it is – Mark Zuckerberg is one of three people who currently has more billions under his belt than years he has lived. According to Forbes, Carlos Slim touched over it once in 2011 when he was valued at $74 billion at the age of 71. He matched it in 2013 with $73 billion at 73, and despite the fact that as you get older, the bar gets a little harder to leap over, Slim is actually bucking the trend. Bill Gates is worth $80.1 billion at age 58. Zuckerberg has proved himself anything but an idle CEO, and the results of what some have called outrageous spending are paying off in a big way. He bought Instagram for $1bn just before Facebook’s IPO. Crazy, some said. He laid out a staggering $16bn for the messaging app WhatsApp. “Insane.” His most recent big buy – $2bn for VR headset company Oculus Rift – has been widely labeled an extravagant boy’s toy purchase. He doesn’t own a music streaming site yet, although he does have a pretty solid partnership with Spotify that could easily turn into an acquisition, and he hasn’t yet made any noise about a move into video streaming, so there’s still huge growth potential.   This article originally appeared at Business Insider Australia.

FlickrCaterpillar just announced Q2 financial results that beat expectations. The construction and mining equipment giant earned $1.69 per share, beating expectations for $1.52. Revenue came in at $14.15 billion, which was a bit lower than the $14.50 billion expected. As a global supplier of capital equipment, many look to CAT as a bellwether of economic activity. "After a sizable drop in sales and revenues in 2013, our ongoing forecasting process has, since the third quarter of last year, pegged 2014 as a roughly ­flat year for sales.  That's still the case," said CEO Doug Oberhelman. "There have been plusses and minuses, but they've both been relatively muted in the context of our total sales and revenues.  While we'd certainly like to see improvement in economies around the world, and more specifically, the mining industry, the stability that we've seen this year has helped.  Even though sales and revenues are relatively flat compared to last year, we've improved the bottom line with better execution and continued focus on costs," Management also announced a new plan to buyback approximately $2.5 billion worth of shares during Q3. "With a strong balance sheet, positive cash flow, sufficient cash on hand and more modest needs for capital expenditures, it makes sense to continue to reward stockholders," said Oberhelman.

Excerpted from Zach Pandl’s newest whitepaper Structural weakness in labor force participation means there is less slack in the labor market than commonly believed. Limited spare capacity in turn implies earlier rate hikes and more risk that inflation eventually overshoots the Federal Reserve’s target. In recent decades that target was “minimum unemployment,” with the minimum defined as the rate consistent with stable inflation. Judging by this standard, the unemployment gap today is less than one percentage point, implying a small amount of remaining labor market slack and only modest downward pressure on inflation (Exhibit 1). However, the most recent recession and slow recovery have raised questions about whether this definition of full employment remains valid. Columbia ManagementConceptually, the Fed’s working definition of full employment will be related to the risk of overshooting the inflation target. By focusing on narrow measures of labor market slack, Fed officials will run less risk of overshooting on inflation (and some risk of undershooting). By aiming for broader measures of slack, above-target inflation becomes more likely. Exactly how much risk the Fed is taking depends on the underlying state of the economy: in particular, how much of the weakness in broader measures of labor utilization is cyclical vs. structural. Since the economy bottomed in mid-2009, real gross domestic product (GDP) has increased at an annualized rate of just 2.1%. If GDP growth could have been known in advance, standard macroeconomic models would have predicted a flat or rising unemployment rate over the last five years. Instead, after peaking at 10% in October 2009, the unemployment rate has declined to just 6.1% today. The primary reason for the steady decline has been falling labor force participation — and available evidence is pessimistic about the prospects of a rebound. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the traditional unemployment rate appears to be giving a broadly accurate signal about spare capacity in the U.S. economy (Exhibit 2) Columbia ManagementBy focusing on broad measures of underutilization, policymakers are signaling optimism about the economy’s productive potential and/or a high tolerance for overshooting. We think the former is inconsistent with the data and the latter is inconsistent with the normal conservative tendencies of central banks. Perhaps they are simply hoping for the best. We think Fed officials will ultimately change their minds on the degree of labor market slack in light of compelling evidence and then fall back to a focus on the unemployment rate. Indeed, we may have seen early signs of this already, with the committee’s funds rate forecasts beginning to react to the falling unemployment rate this year. Any hints of a faster recovery in wage or price inflation would likely accelerate this process. Although Chicago Fed President Evans and others have advocated a willingness to overshoot the inflation target, we wonder if their message will change when above-target inflation becomes a clear and present danger. Regardless of how the Fed’s views evolve, this is not a terribly attractive environment for high-quality fixed income — overshooting is not a term bond investors generally like. Despite healthy returns to interest-sensitive assets in the first half of 2014, we remain cautious on the outlook for the balance of this year. Limited spare capacity means one of two outcomes is likely: (1) earlier-than-expected rate hikes or (2) higher-than-expected inflation. The distinction matters for the shape of the yield curve, but both outcomes are unfriendly for Treasury duration. Separately, limited spare capacity means that inflation risks have become more balanced. We are not concerned about the size of the Fed’s balance sheet and its ability to tighten policy when the time comes. Rather, traditional cyclical upswings in wage and price inflation could begin well before the Fed is expected to normalize policy. Thus, at current valuations we believe inflation-protected government bonds are more attractive than their nominal counterparts. FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Lukas BarthGerman pianist Stefan Aaron plays an orange piano on a "flying carpet" platform suspended from a helicopter, over the Munich airport July 23, 2014. Good morning! Here's what you need to know: Facebook Is Doing Better Than Expected. Facebook reported Q2 earnings and revenue that beat analysts expectations, and the stock is up by almost 8% in premarket trading. At $0.42, earnings per share beat expectations by a whopping $0.12. Monthly active users jumped 14% to 1.32 billion. Mobile monthly active users exploded 31% to 1.07 billion. China Is Doing Better Than Expected. China's flash manufacturing PMI jumped to an 18-month high of 52.0 in July, signaling accelerating growth in the sector. Economists were expecting a reading of 51.0. "Economic activity continues to improve in July, suggesting that the cumulative impact of mini-stimulus measures introduced earlier is still filtering through," said HSBC's Hongbin Qu. "We expect policy makers to maintain their accommodative stance over the next few months to consolidate the recovery." Germany Is Doing Better Than Expected. Germany's flash PMI jumped to a 3-month high of 55.9 in July, beating expectations for 53.8. "Following the joy of lifting the football World Cup trophy, July’s flash PMI results provide further positive news for Germany," said Markit's Oliver Kolodseike. "A deeper look into the data shows that the main driver of the strong PMI reading was the service sector, where companies reported the steepest increase in activity for just over three years. That said, manufacturing also made a positive contribution to the numbers, suggesting that the economic upturn remains broad-based." France Is Doing Better Than Expected. France's flash PMI jumped to a 3-month high of 49.4 in July, beating expectations for 48.3. "The French private sector economy remained in reverse gear in July, dragged down by weakness in the manufacturing industry which offset a small improvement in services," said Markit's Jack Kennedy. "PMI data remain consistent with quarterly GDP close to stagnation levels, as the economy continues to show little sign of turning around its recent sluggish performance." Japan Is Not Doing Better Than Expected. Despite policymakers' ongoing efforts to stimulate the economy by making export goods more competitive via a weaker yen, trade numbers disappointed. The trade deficit narrowed to 822.2 billion yen in June, but it was wider than the 642.9 billion yen estimated. Japan's flash PMI was nothing to celebrate either, falling to 50.8 in July from 51.5 in June. "Japanese manufacturers’ new orders remained in growth territory for the second month running, while there was a rise in new exports for the first time in four months," said Markit's Amy Brownbill. "These weren’t enough to prevent output stagnating, although this most likely reflects a little payback from the solid gains seen in June and the on-going unwinding of the impact of the the hike in sales tax earlier in the year." Ford's Doing Better Than Expected. Ford announced Q2 earnings of $0.40 per share, which was better than the $0.36 expected. Revenue of $37.4 billion was also higher than expected. Management attributed the healthy quarter to improvement in Europe and robust growth in China. Markets Like All This. The S&amp;P 500 closed at an all-time high on Wednesday, and futures are pointing to another day in the green. U.S. futures are up modestly with Dow futures up 28 points and S&amp;P futures up 3 points. In Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 is up 0.1%, France's CAC 40 is up 0.6%, and Germany's DAX is up 0.4%. Asia closed with Hong Kong's Hang Seng up 0.7%. Initial Jobless Claims Plunge. Initial weekly claims for unemployment insurance fell to 284,000 from 303,000 a week ago. This is the lowest level since 2006. "Seasonal factors tend to exacerbate volatility in claims during this time of the year, with the Labor Department highlighting that auto retooling shutdowns (typical during this time of the year) may have caused claims to fluctuate," said TD Securities Gennadiy Goldberg. "The claims data leads us to believe that retooling shutdowns may have been much smaller in 2014 than in previous years due to lower auto inventory days, leading seasonal factors to exacerbate the decline in unadjusted claims." Housing Market Update At 10:00 A.M. ET. Economists estimate sales fell 5.8% to an annualized pace of 475,000. "Given the outsized increase in May, a downward revision is also possible," said Bank of America Merrill Lynch economists. "Smoothing through some of the monthly swings, we see an improving trend for housing demand after a weak winter.This is also consistent with the modest recovery in the NAHB homebuilder sentiment survey." The SEC's Going After S&amp;P. "The parent of Standard &amp; Poor's, which is defending against a $5 billion lawsuit by the federal government over its credit ratings, said on Wednesday it may soon also face U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charges over another set of ratings," reported Reuters' Jonathan Stempel and Sarah Lynch. "In a regulatory filing, McGraw-Hill Financial Inc said it received a "Wells notice" on July 22 indicating the SEC is weighing filing civil charges for alleged securities law violations over S&amp;P's ratings of six commercial mortgage-backed securities transactions issued in 2011."

REUTERS/Tyrone SiuSo, the preliminary purchasing managers' index (PMI) reports are being released around the world, and overall they've been much stronger than expected. PMI is based on a survey of purchasing managers, and it captures a wide array of information including activity, orders, prices, employment, and outlook. Any reading about 50 represents growth. Let's run through some of the big reports: China PMI (52.0 in July, 51.0 Estimated): This was an 18-month high. "Economic activity continues to improve in July, suggesting that the cumulative impact of mini-stimulus measures introduced earlier is still filtering through," said HSBC's Hongbin Qu. "We expect policy makers to maintain their accommodative stance over the next few months to consolidate the recovery." France PMI (49.4 in July, 48.3 Estimated): This was a 3-month high. "The French private sector economy remained in reverse gear in July, dragged down by weakness in the manufacturing industry which offset a small improvement in services," said Markit's Jack Kennedy. "PMI data remain consistent with quarterly GDP close to stagnation levels, as the economy continues to show little sign of turning around its recent sluggish performance." Germany PMI (55.9 in July, 53.8 Estimated): This was a 3-month high. "Following the joy of lifting the football World Cup trophy, July’s flash PMI results provide further positive news for Germany," said Markit's Oliver Kolodseike.

Eurozone PMI (54.0 in July, 52.8 Estimated): This was a 3-month high. "Business activity picked up again in July to suggest that the economy is growing at one of the strongest rates we have seen in the past three years," said Markit's Chris Williamson. "However, even with the resumption of stronger growth, the survey data suggest the region<U+201F>s GDP is expanding at a modest pace of approximately 0.4% per quarter. Importantly, this growth is not fast enough to encourage firms to take on staff in sufficiently large numbers to have a meaningful impact on unemployment. The July survey once again saw only very modest job creation." But not all of the news was good. Japan PMI (50.8 in July, Down from 51.5 in June): "Japanese manufacturers’ new orders remained in growth territory for the second month running, while there was a rise in new exports for the first time in four months," said Markit's Amy Brownbill. "These weren’t enough to prevent output stagnating, although this most likely reflects a little payback from the solid gains seen in June and the on-going unwinding of the impact of the the hike in sales tax earlier in the year." Japan Trade Balance (822.2 billion yen deficit in June, 642.9 billion yen estimated) South Korea GDP (+3.6% in Q2, +3.7% estimated) Net net, markets seem to be reacting positively to all of this. In Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 is up 0.1%, France's CAC 40 is up 0.6%, and Germany's DAX is up 0.4%. Asia closed with Hong Kong's Hang Seng up 0.7%. U.S. futures are up modestly with Dow futures up 28 points and S&amp;P futures up 3 points. FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersU.S. President Barack Obama speaks before signing the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act at the White House in WashingtonPresident Barack Obama will call on Thursday for an end to a corporate loophole that allows companies to avoid federal taxes by shifting their tax domiciles overseas in deals known as "inversions," White House officials said. Obama will make the comments during remarks about the economy at Los Angeles Technical College. The president is in California on a three-day fundraising swing for Democrats. So-called inversion deals occur when a U.S. company acquires or sets up a foreign company, then moves its U.S. tax domicile to the foreign company and its lower-tax home country. Nine inversion deals have been agreed to this year by companies ranging from banana distributor Chiquita Brands International Inc to drug maker AbbVie Inc and more are under consideration. The transactions are setting a record pace since the first inversion was done 32 years ago. Several Democrats have offered bills to curb inversions, which let companies cut their taxes primarily by putting foreign earnings out of the reach of the Internal Revenue Service. Obama will throw his weight behind the Democratic bills, calling for a rule change that would deem any company with half of its business in the United States to be U.S.-domiciled. The proposed changes, already put forward in Obama's annual budget, would be retroactive to May of this year and implemented independently of moves to achieve broader tax reform. "We have seen increased activity from companies in the inversion space and as a result the president's view ... is that we should be acting as quickly as possible," a White House official told reporters on a conference call. "That will buy us more time and space to ... reform our tax code as a whole." Republicans prefer a change to inversions to be part of an effort to reform the U.S. tax code. The White House supports broad tax reform but argues that action on inversions is needed now. "We can't afford to wait to reform our tax code completely to deal with inversion," the official said, adding that such deals would cost the United States an estimated $17 billion in revenue over the next decade.   (Additional reporting by Kevin Drawbaugh in Washington; Editing by Ron Popeski) FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersThe gold colored version of the new iPhone 5S is seen after Apple Inc's media event in CupertinoBEIJING (Reuters) - The mobile industry has long held that Samsung's broad range of mobile devices makes it nimble in changing markets, while Apple loses out by rigidly sticking to its high-end gadgets. But manufacturers' recent earnings reports challenge those assumptions, at least in China, the world's biggest mobile market - where the roll-out of the next-generation 4G wireless network has been touted as a booster for smartphone makers seeking growth as demand in advanced countries falters. Apple Inc's latest quarterly results showed sales of its high-end phones in China grew at nearly twice the pace analysts had expected. Meanwhile, budget offerings from Chinese firms won at the cheaper end, effectively squeezing industry leader Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. Even as Apple posted strong China sales, the South Korean tech giant warned this month that quarterly earnings could drop 25 percent due to an inventory build-up of cheaper phones and weaker demand for 3G products in China. That could suggest that Samsung's strategy of offering everything to counter every price point may actually have left it stranded between being a price competitive brand and a premium gadget seller. By contrast, Apple has studiously cultivated its high-end aura, and its iPhones and iPads continue to command a higher price tag on average than its rivals. Samsung has strong brand loyalty in China, but charges 60-100 percent more than Chinese-made phones with similar features, said Tom Kang, an analyst at Counterpoint Research in Seoul. "Even though they have a brand premium, that's a bit too much." Samsung declined to comment for this article. Samsung's high-end smartphones and tablets such as its Galaxy S range, its answer to the iPhone and iPad, accounted for just a quarter of its January-March sales volume in China, while devices priced below 500 yuan ($80.75) made up the vast majority, according to data firm Canalys. At the same time, Samsung has come under pressure from the rise of Chinese budget handset makers like Xiaomi, which this week released the Mi 4, its new 1,999 yuan 4G handset. Underscoring the challenges Samsung faces, it had just one model in China's top-5 best sellers in May and June - with its big-screen Galaxy Note 3 tied in fifth place with a Lenovo Group &lt;0992.HK&gt; phone, according to Counterpoint. Apple said this week its third-quarter revenue was buoyed by unexpectedly strong results in China, where iPhone sales jumped nearly 50 percent in April-June. "China, honestly, was surprising to us ... we thought it would be strong, but it went well past what we thought. The unit growth was really off the charts across the board," CEO Tim Cook told analysts on Tuesday. China Mobile Ltd's &lt;0941.HK&gt; 4G customer growth has been accelerating after a tepid start in February. The number of 4G subscribers rose to nearly 14 million in June, up from just 1.3 million at the end of February. "A lot of China Mobile customers have been holding on to old phones, so when the high-speed 4G came out they naturally switched to a 5S or 5C and upgraded. This trend will only become more apparent with the iPhone 6's release," said C.K. Lu, an analyst at Gartner. China Mobile, the world's biggest carrier by subscribers, declined to disclose the current breakdown of its 4G subscribers, but its chairman, Xi Guohua, said in March that "most of our 1.34 million 4G users are using an iPhone." For Samsung, the widely anticipated 4G roll-out has delivered a mixed result. "The roll-out of 4G helped both Samsung and Apple initially, but the operator and regulatory body's ... policies had recently been unfavorable towards Samsung as the 3G demand and subsidy dropped," said Counterpoint's Kang. "Samsung had been selling quite a lot of volume of 3G phones to Chinese operators but that demand dropped sharply. The recent pro-4G policies that penalized 3G vendors ... was not favorable to Samsung." Samsung said earlier this month its China sales were hurt by price competition in the low- to mid-tier sectors as well as tepid sales of 3G devices, as buyers wait to buy high-end 4G phones. As China Mobile expands services and smaller rivals China Unicom &lt;0762.HK&gt; and China Telecom &lt;0728.HK&gt; prepare to launch their preferred competing 4G technology, handset makers are bracing for more surprises - with new product plans including Apple's widely expected bigger-screen iPhone. "Right now, what we've seen is just a small part of the users who want to upgrade to 4G," said Lu. "The broader set of consumers, the relatively mainstream ones who want a large screen, are still waiting for the iPhone 6. So when that comes, the effect on high-end brands like Samsung will be even bigger." Kang at Counterpoint also said an iPhone with a large screen would "go directly into Samsung's territory" and Samsung may respond with something unique, such as a curved display. Apple is confident it can gain further traction in China thanks to its relationship with China Mobile and an army of some 150,000 Chinese developers making apps for the local App Store. "They continue to do the roll-out," Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters this week, referring to China Mobile's 4G network. "They continue to add points of sale, they're starting to do more marketing activities, so we think we have a really good runway in front of us with China Mobile."

FlickrSYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian stocks edged higher on Thursday as U.S. tech earnings impressed and a surprisingly strong reading on Chinese manufacturing bolstered hopes for recovery in the world's second-biggest economy. The HSBC flash PMI for China came in at 52.0 for July, well above forecasts of a small rise to 51 in July and the highest reading in 18 months. There was also good news on the outlook, with a sub-index of new orders reaching 53.7. The news injected some life into a sluggish session and helped China's CSI300 index of leading Shanghai andShenzhen A-share jump 1.9 percent. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained 0.2 percent, and Australia notched another six-year peak. Japan's export figures were not so bright and the Nikkei fell 0.3 percent. South Korea's benchmark index dipped 0.1 percent after data showed the economy growing at the slowest pace in more than a year, leading Seoul to launch a package of stimulus measures. [TOP/CEN] European socks also looked set for a subdued start with financial spreadbetters predicting losses of 0.1 to 0.2 percent for the FTSE 100, DAX and CAC 40. Yet traders noted that money was clearly flowing back into emerging markets in search for yield. MSCI's index of emerging equities had jumped in the past two sessions to reach its highest since January 2013. "Emerging markets continue to be main benefactor from the mix of low volatility, improving global growth and supportive central banks," analysts at Barclays said in a note. Helping sentiment is the U.S. earnings season turning out better than first feared. Barclays estimates that of the 22 percent of S&amp;P 500 companies have reported quarterly results since July 1, 64 percent beat earnings expectations and 65 percent beat revenue estimates. Apple Inc rose 2.6 percent as concerns faded about the iPhone maker's margins. Facebook Inc beat forecasts and its stock climbed 5.5 percent after hours. All this helped the Nasdaq gain 0.4 percent, while the S&amp;P 500 added 0.2 percent. The Dow bucked the trend, pulled lower by a 2.3 percent drop in Boeing Co shares. The U.S. aircraft maker reported a 52 percent jump in quarterly profit, but investors were spooked by rising costs in its military tanker program. The Dow closed down 0.2 percent. The prospect of more sanctions against Russia over the Ukraine crisis and the downed Malaysian airliner maintained a safety bid for high-rated bonds. For U.S. Treasuries, investors were buying more liquid shorter-dated paper, nudging two-year yields down to 0.48 percent. In currencies, the New Zealand dollar led the action by skidding to a six-week low after the country's central bank took a verbal axe to the currency, saying its high level was unjustified. The kiwi dollar dropped a full U.S. cent to $0.8586 when the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) raised rates to 3.5 percent, but said it was prudent to pause on policy after four straight hikes. The Australian dollar climbed as much as a quarter of a U.S. cent higher as the improving Chinese outlook promised to support demand for the country's resource exports. Activity elsewhere was limited, with the euro stuck at eight-month lows around $1.3460, leaving the dollar index hovering at a six-week peak. Against the yen, the U.S. dollar idled at 101.43, recovering only slowly from the recent low of 101.09. In commodities, gold was lagging behind in the beauty contest with equities and eased to $1,296.90 an ounce. Crude oil prices ran into renewed selling after a bounce on Wednesday.

Thomson ReutersCustomers have a lunch inside a 'Restaumobile' restaurant truck for the start of the operation "Tous au restaurant" in ParisJuly 24, (Reuters) - The euro zone's private sector expanded at the fastest rate in three months in July, although faster growth in new business was driven mainly by companies cutting prices again, surveys showed on Thursday. Markit's Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), based on surveys of thousands of companies across the region and a good early indicator of overall growth, rose to 54.0 in July from 52.8, its highest since April. Any number above 50 indicates expansion. The services sector across the 18-member bloc performed better than any of the 39 economists polled by Reuters had forecast, while manufacturers also reported a stronger month than suggested by the median Reuters forecast. Markit said the data suggest quarterly economic growth of 0.4 percent if a similar pace is maintained in August and September. "There is a very encouraging expansion in the services sector, with Germany growing at its fastest pace in three years and even French companies returning to modest growth," said Chris Williamson, Markit's chief economist. The rest of the euro zone performed even better, with the largest monthly increase in business activity recorded since August 2007 accompanied by a similar surge in new orders growth. Yet while euro zone services business expanded at its fastest pace since May 2011 - the PMI rose to 54.4 - firms have now cut prices for 31 months in a row. The sub-index measuring service sector output prices fell to 48.3, despite high raw material costs. With inflation stuck at 0.5 percent in June, well below the European Central Bank's danger level of 1 percent, that suggests policymakers still face a tough task to thwart the threat of deflation. "There's so much spare capacity that deflation remains a bigger risk at the moment," Williamson said. "Companies simply cannot push through cost increases to consumers at this point." Job creation remains a problem, however, with firms barely hiring additional staff in July. The employment sub-index in the services sector was steady at 50.9 in July. It was also a less positive story for manufacturing business, where growth essentially remained steady at a slow rate, with French factories still reporting a deterioration in conditions while Germany's reporting a slight improvement. The manufacturing index stood at 51.9, up a tick from 51.8 in June. The output index, which feeds into the composite PMI, edged up slightly to 53.0 from 52.8. Asked why manufacturing was lagging behind growth in services, Williamson said: "It probably reflects geopolitical concerns, notably the unrest in Ukraine. That's beginning to feed through in the survey responses more and more." FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Charles PlatiauAn employee walks behind the logo of BNP Paribas in a company's building in Issy-les-Moulineaux, near Paris, June 2, 2014. NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. authorities' $8.9 billion settlement last month with French bank BNP Paribas for sanctions busting will pay for New York cops to get live computer feeds of street crime and for new carpets in the offices of prosecutors, among many other things. In the past few months, American regulators and prosecutors have forced some of the world's largest banks to pay massive fines for everything from breaching U.S. sanctions to alleged mortgage abuse and illegal tax schemes. Now the question is what the U.S. is going to do with all the cash. In some places – particularly New York state – that is leading to ugly wrangling over how to spend it. Some of the $18.5 billion in penalties U.S. authorities have levied on banks since May was already earmarked in settlement papers for specific purposes, such as principal forgiveness on struggling homeowners’ mortgages. But a lot is not allocated for anything in particular, raising many questions. One is whether there should be clearer standards for how such money is used by a maze of state and federal authorities. Another is whether the money has distorted incentives for officials. One former prosecutor, who did not want to be identified, said the ability to use the money for broad purposes could motivate officials to demand higher settlements. The authorities dismiss that notion. "That's nonsense," said Matthew Anderson, a spokesman for New York banking regulator Benjamin Lawsky, whose office has been a major player in recent settlements. "If they don't want to face penalties, they shouldn't break the law by financially supporting regimes involved in terrorism and genocide." Since May, Credit Suisse has coughed up $2.6 billion for helping Americans evade taxes, BNP agreed to pay $8.9 billion for violating U.S. sanctions laws, and Citigroup last week agreed to pay $7 billion to resolve claims it misled investors about shoddy mortgage-backed securities. The majority of the money will go straight to the Treasury Department’s general fund, where it will help the U.S. pay its bills. The specifics of that spending are virtually impossible to track. But other federal authorities still have some of the cash to play with. For example, the Justice Department will get a 3 percent management fee - about $6 million - from the Citigroup deal for collecting the settlement money on behalf of another agency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. The department didn't return a request for comment on how it would spend the money. It has used similar fees from a settlement with JPMorgan to pay for more lawyers to work on other mortgage securities cases. Also, most of the federal portion of the BNP deal - about $3.8 billion - will be swept into the Treasury and Justice Departments' asset forfeiture funds, where the cash will join seized proceeds from other criminal ventures. By statute, such money is used to support asset forfeiture operations around the country, and state and local law enforcement bodies can apply for funds. The requests can include everything from money for expert witness fees to the costs of drug evidence storage. REUTERSThis chart shows the 10 largest bank finesNew York authorities are getting some $5 billion from the settlements, far more money than other states, thanks to the roles its officials have played in the investigations and negotiations. New York prosecutors started the investigation that led to BNP and other foreign banks, and the state banking regulator has leverage from its authority to revoke the banks' licenses to operate in the state. The office of Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance plans to use part of the $448 million it will keep from the BNP settlement on technology investments for the city’s police, including feeds from camera networks around the city. Once the fiber is laid, police will have the potential to retrieve video of, say, a suspect after an emergency call comes in. Vance is also considering using the money for an illegal-gun market study, to improve safety in public housing in the city, and for upgrades to the law enforcement agency’s decrepit office space, where carpeting in some areas dates to the 1980s. Chief Assistant District Attorney Karen Friedman Agnifilo said some of the projects have the ability to "transform" the criminal justice system. About $4 billion from the recent settlements is destined for the New York state general fund and has already set off politicians, community activists and government officials who have all been lining up competing proposals for next year’s budget negotiations. "There are huge question marks here and no transparency," said Bennett Gershman, an expert on prosecutorial ethics who is a professor at New York's Pace Law School. He said the discretion given to authorities on how to use the cash creates opportunities for abuse. There have already been some unseemly struggles in New York in recent years. In 2009, then New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg accused then Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau of maintaining secret bank accounts amid a fight over whether the city was getting its fair share of big settlements. A similar feud developed between New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and the state’s Governor Andrew Cuomo over last year's $13 billion mortgage-related settlement against JPMorgan. Cuomo accused Schneiderman of having too much power over how to spend the $613 million obtained by the attorney general. Cuomo himself previously had used such power over settlement monies when he held the attorney general’s job from 2007-2010. Cuomo managed to get legislation passed in the state capital Albany earlier this year requiring certain settlement cash to be deposited into the state's general fund, which the governor and legislators control. Some budget watchers are already cautioning politicians against making frivolous election-year promises that commit the latest windfall to paying for operating costs, funding pet projects, or for tax giveaways that could be hard to reverse. Cuomo' is committed to a tax cutting agenda. His office declined to comment on uses of the money. Republicans in the state Senate want to use some of the money for tax rebates for homeowners. They would also use it to scrap a $500 million tax on utilities and phase out a $1.3 billion payroll tax that funds the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Robert Astorino, the Republican challenger to Cuomo, a Democrat, in November’s election, wants funds to help replace the aging Tappan Zee Bridge that spans the Hudson River north of New York City. Budget expert Elizabeth Lynham, of New York’s Citizens Budget Commission, would like the state to use the money to retire debt or reduce state liabilities, such as pension or retiree health costs. "The reason Albany's finances are at best stretched thin or completely out of whack is because of the feeding frenzy that occurs when money appears like manna from heaven," said Blair Horner, legislative director at the New York Public Interest Resource Group. Often money from settlements has been used for general budget purposes even though it may have been targeted more specifically. For years, U.S. states have found ways to divert some of the $200 billion tobacco companies agreed in 1998 to pay over 25 years away from smoking and other health programs. Similarly, some of the money from a national foreclosure settlement stemming from the 2008 financial crisis was used by the states to balance budgets and other projects rather than to help people hit by foreclosures. This can store up financial trouble if authorities and others get too reliant on the money and then the spigot stops flowing as fast, leaving a budget hole or program that must be maintained. Robert Hockett, professor of financial law at Cornell Law School in Ithaca, New York, said it was important for the money to go first to victims of any fraud that led to the settlements rather than to those who have influence over politicians. "We don't want it to be treated as a bonanza," Hockett said. (Reporting by Karen Freifeld, Edward Krudy and Aruna Viswanatha; Editing by Karey Van Hall, Martin Howell) FREE AppDownload

REUTERS/Lee Jae-WonA model poses next to LG Electronics' organic light-emitting diode (OLED) television in Seoul January 2, 2013.SEOUL (Reuters) - LG Electronics Inc reported on Thursday its strongest quarterly profit in more than three years, beating analyst estimates thanks to a pickup in television sales and a turnaround in its mobile phone business. The world's second-largest TV maker after local rival Samsung Electronics Co Ltd said profit at its TV arm improved in April-June from a year earlier, while its smartphone shipments rose 20 percent to a record 14.5 million handsets. The global TV market is showing signs of life as demand from advanced markets picks up, with sales of larger-sized ultra high-definition (UHD) TVs widely seen as a potential boost. But LG and market analysts said a likely rise in marketing costs by TV makers may limit the extent of any earnings boost. "The results were better than expected," said HMC Investment analyst Greg Roh. "A key factor to watch is how well the G3 smartphone fares in the United States, but the outlook appears to be bright given the second-quarter numbers." For the April-June period, LG Electronics reported an operating profit of 606 billion won ($589.04 million), compared with a 524 billion won mean estimate of 39 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. That was LG's best operating profit since at least 2011. The company restated its earnings last year due to accounting changes and did not have new figures available for 2010 or earlier, said a company spokeswoman. Shares of LG Electronics were trading up 4.6 percent as the wider market traded flat, extending gains following the company's earnings disclosure. LG's TV division reported operating profit of 154.5 billion won, up from 93.7 billion won a year earlier on an improved product mix and lower fixed costs. The mobile phone division turned an operating profit of 85.9 billion won, from a 61.2 billion won profit a year prior. The company said sales of smartphones featuring Long-Term Evolution (LTE) communication technology rose sharply due to new products including the G3 high-end smartphone. The G3 smartphone launched in late May to generally positive reviews, boosting hopes for a turnaround for the handset division as the product began selling in major markets such as the United States and Europe earlier in July.
