REUTERS/Steffi Loos Pavel Khodorkovsky, son of Russian former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, speaks to media outside Adlon Hotel in Berlin, December 21, 2013. Khodorkovsky, the Russian oil tycoon jailed for a decade after posing a challenge to Vladimir Putin, was freed by a presidential pardon on Friday and immediately flew to Berlin where he hoped to be reunited with his family. The son of the pardoned Russian oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky told yesterday of the tearful moment when he was reunited with his father, ending a decade-long separation that has defined his adult life. "Actually, you know, I didn't get the first word," revealed 28-year-old Pavel Khodorkovsky in an exclusive interview with The Telegraph. "My daughter just ran out to him. She got the first hug and the first kiss - but that was cool with me." It was the first time that Mikhail Khodorkovsky had met his four-year-old grand-daughter, Diana, and the start of a deeply emotional weekend as friends and family flew into Berlin to be reunited with the man who grew from being a reviled oligarch into a focal point of Russian opposition during his time in jail. "There was a lot of hugging, a lot of thanks," said Pavel. "I certainly knew that it hasn't been easy for him. He knows that he has had a lot of support form a lot of different people across the world, but he knows how much the family has been waiting to see him. He said to me: 'thank you for not giving up on me' which was so important to me." The reunion was made possible by the sudden release of Mr Khodorkovsky senior on Friday, following two years of German diplomacy to broker a deal that ñ according to rumours circulating in the German media ñ may have been clinched with the offer of an exchange involving two Russian sleeper agents jailed in Germany earlier this year. Der Spiegel magazine reported yesterday that the deal to free him was brokered by the former German foreign minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, who spoke personally with Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, during up to two years of negotiations. Mr Khodorkovsky telephoned the The New Times, an opposition magazine for which he wrote a column from prison, to thank its staff for their support. He told them: "The most important thing today is freedom, freedom, freedom," In a reference to his former business partner, who was also jailed for defying the Kremlin, he added: "A lot lies ahead, the release of those hostages who still remain in prison, first and foremost Platon Lebedev." He is expected to say more today at a press conference called at the Berlin Museum, next to Checkpoint Charlie. Pavel confirmed that his father's release ñ involving a top secret German diplomatic back-channel that was approved by the German chancellor, Angela Merkel - had come as a complete surprise to the family and the legal team. Mr Putin announced the decision after a press conference on Thursday. "It was a big surprise - to my father as well - because no-one thought it was going to happen," Pavel said. "Once we knew from the press conference we had no idea when or how it would happen. Certainly, no-one knew it would happen so quickly. "He got put on a plane. He got out of there in the middle of the night and he wound up in Germany. There wasn't much room for explanation. It was just pick him up and go. He was woken up in the middle of the night. The prison authorities said 'Wake up, let's go' and he was driven to a plane, and that's it." Pavel Khodorkovsky was settling into business school in Boston in the summer of 2003 when he last saw his father, who knew that when he returned to Russia he faced almost certain arrest. In the 10 years since, Pavel met and married his Russian wife Olesya, and the couple had their first child with one more on the way. Being unable to travel to Russia himself for fear of arrest or harassment by Russian security services, the only contact Pavel had with his father was occasional letters and photos and, more recently, a weekly phone call. But he said: "He hasn't really changed much; he's in great shape he looks very much the same as 10 years ago when I last saw him in person. "He's fit, very energetic. He slipped right back into his working routine. He's trying to get a sense and a hold over everything." After a decade in Russia's unforgiving penal system, the former billionaire boss of Yukos, the now-defunct oil giant, did not crave a particular luxury or a favourite food when he emerged, Pavel said. Instead he preferred to indulge his passion for electronics. "One of the first things he did was get hold of an iPhone and an iPad and start learning. He couldn't wait. He had read about them in prison but never seen one. He doesn't care about food and luxuries, but with the iPad he was, like, 'This is amazing'. "He always loved technology. He was ecstatic and has asked me to buy him a Kindle, so I'm going out to look for one for him in Germany." In an interview with The Daily Telegraph in October, Pavel admitted that his father's decision to put principle before family ñ above the needs, even, of his own son ñ had left him with a complicated set of emotions, which he now looked forward to talking through when the time came. "We're definitely going to have those conversations, but later. I don't want to go there now because so much has happened, there is so much emotion." Yesterday he backed up his father's insistence, in a statement released on Friday, that no admission of guilt had been made before Mr Putin issued his pardon. Pavel, who has himself been a fierce and public critic of Mr Putin's human rights record, founding his own New York-based NGO, the Institute of Modern Russia, to promote the cause of democracy in Russia, said: "There are no conditions or anything, however it is common sense right now that my father does not go back to Russia. "I would strongly discourage my father from going back ñ it's a dangerous situation for him. It was then, and it remains so now." One of his greatest regrets is that his father's imprisonment came just as he was beginning to understand his passion for business, spending the odd day as a teenager at the offices of Yukos. Now, 10 years on, Pavel has his own business in New York making smart-meters and energy-saving software, and looks forward to discussing expansion plans with his father. "He's been actually giving me advice through the years, but now we are able to have a proper conversation, I'm going to be picking his brains a lot, you can bet on that." Pavel was speaking to The Telegraph by phone after giving a brief statement to the world's media outside the hotel where the family is staying. He thanked them on his father's behalf and announced that Mikhail Khodorkovsky would speak publicly for the first time on Sunday at the Berlin Museum, next to Checkpoint Charlie - the former crossing point between Communist East Berlin and the capitalist West. He said he did not expect his father to outline his plans for the future in detail, but that he would try to answer as many of the world's questions as possible. The former German foreign minister, Mr Genscher, was reportedly seen in November at the Valdai Club meeting of diplomats and academics in conversation with Mr Putin. When the deal was approved he called up his friend, businessman Ulrich Betterman, to persuade him to lend a Cessna 525 jet to fly Mr Khodorkovksy from Russia to freedom. Alexander Rahr, who assisted Mr Genscher in the talks and was with him to meet Mr Khodorkovksy on the tarmac on Friday afternoon, called it "a triumph of German diplomacy". He told Russian television: "It was a matter of secret German diplomacy. And thank God Germany still has such closed, or semi-closed, channels which other European countries or America perhaps no longer have with Russia, and which can work in such situations." For Pavel, however, the only concern is that his father is now free, and that he has an opportunity to rebuild a relationship that was snatched away from him on the very cusp of adulthood. "There is so much to day, but for now, I just want to enjoy him being here. This Christmas is literally the best ever, the best to date." Additional reporting: David Crossland, Berlin 
This is the most 2013 thing of the year. An Australian brand and marketing specialist and a programmer in Portland, Ore. who have never actually met have successfully combined the year's two greatest phenomena: Bitcoin, and doge.¬†The result: Dogecoin. And people are actually using it. If you're not familiar with the doge meme, it's hard to explain ‚Äî ¬†you sort of have to just see it yourself. Basically, someone on the Internet began posting images of Comic Sans thought bubbles in the imagined syntax of a devastatingly cute Shiba Inu dog. Variations on the meme look like this: DailyEdge.ie¬† There's no point to it; it's just one of those Internet things. But people love it ¬†‚Äî¬†you can see some "good ones" here.¬† About three weeks ago, Jackson Palmer, who by day works in Adobe's Sydney marketing department, and who'd been following developments in the cryptocurrency world, absentmindedly tweeted, "Investing in Dogecoin, pretty sure it's the next big thing." He got some replies encouraging him to pursue the idea, and a week later bought the domain Dogecoin.com. Inevitably, it got picked up on reddit, a hotbed of doge activity.¬† Meanwhile in Portland, Billy Markus had been trying to program his own digital currency that would appeal to a broader demographic than the profiteers who've flooded into Bitcoin. But the project had gone nowhere. Then he stumbled across Dogecoin.com¬†within a day or two of the site going live. "The¬†first thing I said was, 'This is so funny.' Then I said, 'I should just make this coin.'" He Tweeted at Palmer saying he wanted to go in on it, and before Palmer even responded, started reconfiguring Bitcoin's sourcecode, which is publicly available, to turn its user-facing elements into the doge meme.  Eventually Palmer wrote back, and the partnership was formed. A little more than a week after Palmer's jokey tweet, Dogecoin was launched. Again it got picked up on reddit, and instantly exploded. It is already ¬†the 13th¬†seventh-largest cryptocurrency, according to Coinmarketcap, with a market value (i.e. number of extant Dogecoins X price of $0.00086) of $8 million.¬†It now enjoys its own full blown ecosystem: in addition to the website, it has a dedicated blog and forum, and of course a subreddit. How has it done this? Largely through something called "tipping." If you're a geek who "performs" a "good deed" on the Internet, it's become common practice for people to "tip" you in your digital currency of choice. For instance: that kid¬†who held up up his Bitcoin wallet's QR-code¬†during ESPN's College Gameday got tipped thousands of dollars by the Bitcoin community for such a brilliant stroke of guerrilla marketing.¬† But it's become somewhat expensive to tip in Bitcoin, so people have turned to Dogecoin. Only about a week after launching, Dogecoin became the second-most-tipped currency, the pair say. They're hoping Facebook will accept a widget they've been working on that would allow friends to "tip" each other with dogecoin.  Still, what's so great about Dogecoin? Technically speaking, it's more of a variation on Litecoin, which runs on a cryptographic program called Scrypt. Like Litecoin, the time it takes to process a Dogecoin transaction is much shorter than for Bitcoin. There are also many more Dogecoins that will come into existence ‚Äî 100 billion versus 21 million. But it's the culture that's sprung up around it that's really driving it forward. Palmer says it comes down to having a lower barrier of entry for people who might be interested in cryptocurrencies but are turned off by either the price of or so-far dubious culture that surrounds Bitcoin.¬† "It's not taking itself as seriously, it's not being used by people ¬†worrying about whether they'll become rich," Palmer said. "It's something to share for thanks or kudos." Markus says his wife, who at first was turned off by his interest in Bitcoin, has started mining Dogecoin herself ‚Äî something you can do with your basic computer, unlike mining Bitcoin, which now requires industrial-strength processors. ¬† The pair say they have no intention of competing with Bitcoin, and both are still fervent believers in its potential to change online banking.¬† "It's a revolutionary technology, absolutely revolutionary," Markus says. "And it works as a store of value because it's deflationary, there will be a cap [on Bitcoins created]. It's just highly speculative, which makes it hard to use, to spend and spread it." How can you tell the Dogecoin phenomenon is not a joke? This morning, Bitcoin and most other altcoins are up about 20%. Dogecoin? Up 250% and counting. Wow.
Flickr via JDLasicaEvan SpiegelThere's an oft-cited study out there that says money†does buy you happiness ó but only up until a certain point.†It says that after you make $75,000 per year, increasing your income is not going to make you any "happier." But the truth about wealth and happiness is more complicated than any study can say. Take the case of Evan Spiegel, the 23-year-old CEO of a startup called Snapchat. Last month, the Wall Street Journal and others reported that Spiegel turned down a $3 billion acquisition offer from Facebook.†When people read these reports, they thought Spiegel was crazy. But here's the thing.†Spiegel comes from a wealthy family. His dad lives in one of the most expensive neighborhoods in the Los Angeles area. Also, Spiegel was able to sell some of his stock in Snapchat to investors for millions of dollars. So the fact is, when he turned down Facebook's $3 billion offer, Spiegel was not saying "no" to being rich.†He was already rich twice over. And what did that money ó his father's and his own ó buy him?†It bought him a relatively risk-free chance to spend the rest of his life running a global technology company. It bought him a pursuit. Having a pursuit that means something to you is not the same thing as having happiness, but it's something like it that can't quite be quantified in a study. Many people in the tech industry know that, and appreciate Spiegel's decision. Not everyone, though. One tech executive I met with last week shook his head in bewilderment when Snapchat came up. He said that Spiegel was "taking food out of the mouths of generations of Spiegels." Obviously, the topic of wealth and its relationship to happiness is complicated and conversations about it are laced with judgement.†And that's why it so fascinating to read a thread they have on Quora where rich people are answering the question: "What does it feel like to be financially rich?" Here are some of the most candid thoughts from the thread. Some of them are heart-warming. Some are brutally honest. Some are very surprising. Screenshot/YouTube"Happiness has mostly to do with relationships and the quality thereof." "I don't believe very much in the hedonics argument about wealth - that the more you have, the more money you need to maintain a certain level of happiness. Happiness has mostly to do with relationships and the quality thereof. I doubt that it's a metric that can be measured effectively by economists to come to a conclusion." ó†J.C. Hewitt "[Being rich] feels like all the other blessings we have in life when times are tough - we know that they are blessings, strive not to take the for granted, but can forget we're blessed when we're feeling down. It's like having a beautiful kid of a wonderful spouse or great parents. And for me, at least, I can say with absolute certainty it has not made me any happier." ó Rick Webb, COO Barbarian Group "I thought, if I †could make 10 million dollars then it must be too easy. In fact, I honestly thought, everyone else had probably already made 11 million dollars. So then I felt poor again. I now needed 100 million dollars to be happy." ó James Altucher "After she attained what she thought was success, [my mother] was diagnosed with Stage IV cancer. She spent the days up until her death regretting almost all the choices she made and beat herself up day after day. One of her last journal entries included reflections on how unappreciative she was with the things in front of her, and finally realizing happiness does not lie within superficial matters a little too late." ó†Mona Nomura †"Rich people are prone to all the same maladies and emotions as anyone else, and at the same frequency. And certainly, in some cases, money itself can cause stress and unhappiness.†But, with one difference -- if you're unhappy and rich, you have money. And money buys creature comforts." ó Steven Kane Shutterstock"After a few months of wealth you will eventually get used to it and become the same person that you are now."After a few months of wealth you will eventually get used to it and become the same person that you are now." ó†Balraj Chana "Socially, the life of someone who makes a lot of money is probably not what you expect. The "rich" on television are usually old money of some kind. The working rich pretty much have to devote their lives to work. At many points, my dad was working and traveling for twelve months out of the year. I think when my sister was born, he was literally commuting between NYC and Z¸rich five days out of every seven."†ó J.C. Hewitt "It feels good when you break your own money making records and look at the rest of the world like retards. It's good to defeat the system and money helps you do that." ó Anonymous. "Life is effortless for the rich. Just by being who you are, perhaps 99% of the world will hop-to and accord you respect that you don't deserve. Even the stupidest and most illiterate rich person can be showered with respect and praise." "Having grown up as a child in a family which can be described as old money, and having since then lived in humbling circumstances, I can say for sure that families from old money treat their children like gods. When I was little, I used to take kids aside and explain to them that I was indeed God. 'Psssst, you know I'm God, right?'†Obviously that feeling has left me, but it hasn't left my father, who used to tell me that we have blue blood. He now sits in his room in a constant depression, and is the most miserable person I know." ó†Igor Atakhanov "†My life has less risk. †If I'm ever ill, I go to the best doctor. †If I want to invest in real estate, I can afford to lose the investment without effect to my lifestyle. †I can have 5 kids and know that each of them will go to college." ó Josh Kerr "When you've achieved all material goals, you startup asking yourself, is this it? And then if you're a truly ambitious individual, with some care for what the world could be you start asking yourself, what next, how can I change the world? That's where I'm at at this point." ó Anonymous
ReutersT-Mobile CEO John Legere ‚Äî T-Mobile's ‚Äúuncarrier‚Äù strategy was one of the 10 best business decisions in 2013.‚ÄôTis the season for listicles, and most firms can‚Äôt get by with Santa‚Äôs timeless business strategy of low-cost, highly scalable elf labor. Instead, enduring success relies on the occasional bold, innovative, or even lucky move ‚Äî a smart call that positions a company to grow, ideally by better serving its customers‚Äô needs rather than just exploiting them. In no particular order, here are Moneybox‚Äôs favorite business moves of 2013. It‚Äôs questionable whether this or anything else will save the ailing midmarket department store, or indeed the very concept of the midmarket department store. But it‚Äôs clear that the company‚Äôs effort to reinvent itself under former Apple retail chief Ron Johnson as a slick, Wi-Fi-enabled, no-discounts shopping experience was a catastrophic flop. This year they brought back an old CEO, brought back discounts, and even though they‚Äôre still struggling,¬†sales trends are in the right direction. The Ron Johnson Catastrophe at J.C. Penney also managed to leave Apple‚Äôs retail operation adrift and listless. Tim Cook brought in John Browett, CEO of British mass-market superstore Tesco, who promptly alienated loyalists with a misguided cost-cutting drive before getting fired. Ahrendts, CEO of the far more upmarket British company Burberry, is a much better choice.¬† Apple‚Äôs retail stores are already insanely successful. They don‚Äôt need a retail chief who can squeeze extra dollars out of them; they need one who can build a lot more ‚Äî especially in Asia ‚Äî where Burberry has opened many more shops than Apple without compromising the brand‚Äôs value. Adding a woman to the executive team can‚Äôt hurt, either. The success of Yahoo shares under Marissa Mayer‚Äôs leadership is mostly a question of financial engineering ‚Äî the company has restructured its Asian holdings and done share buybacks ‚Äî which is really what Dan Loeb, the activist investor who put her in charge, was interested in. But Mayer‚Äôs had the strength and vision to sell the board on a strategy that isn‚Äôt just financial engineering, and throwing $1.1 billion in cash into buying Tumblr ‚Äî rather than handing it to shareholders ‚Äî is key to that deal. Tumblr brought tangible assets in terms of audience and social presence to the table, but it also served as a crucial signal to current and possibly future Yahoo employees that the company is serious about investing in its own long-term future. It might not work, but making the visionary play is an appealing contrast to an American corporate culture that tends to excessively focus on quarterly fluctuations in share prices. Google‚Äôs Chromecast television add-on isn‚Äôt revolutionary technology, but the $35 price point is beyond aggressive. Chromebook laptops starting at $199 aren‚Äôt quite as cheap but are in some ways even more aggressive. The culture of pursuing aggressive growth for the long term at the expense of short-term profits is common in Google‚Äôs online-services homeland, but it‚Äôs bracing to see Mountain View bringing the same spirit to consumer hardware. In a world where the global average income is still just $10,000 a year and all the population growth is happening in poorer places, making things cheaper still counts for a lot. The coffee giant has a perennial need for reliable people to do not especially glamorous work, and the Defense Department faces a constant challenge in finding gainful civilian employment for discharged veterans. Forging a partnership between the Pentagon and Starbucks is a natural solution to a concrete labor market issue. It‚Äôs also great brand extension. Starbucks is associated with a certain kind of upscale, effete lifestyle, but it‚Äôs already become ubiquitous in those markets and faces pressure for even more upscale joints with pour-over coffee and more complex flavors. A partnership with the military is a great way to give the company more of an all-American image and convince a broader swath of the population that they want to make room in their budget for pricey takeout coffee. Though it continues to face regulatory roadblocks in many cities, at this point the biggest barrier to the growth of Uber‚Äôs ride-hiring service is on the supply side: You can‚Äôt sell a ride unless you‚Äôve got a driver. With the national labor market still weak and Uber‚Äôs per-vehicle revenue high, demand for driving jobs is also high. But you still need a car to drive. By reaching a bit outside its core competences of software and customer service and partnering with Toyota and General Motors to get discount car loans for Uber drivers, Uber has taken a big step to solving the bottleneck. The car-loan program should also start turning Uber into a jobs machine, both on city streets and in the factories where the cars are built. The Internet has basically crushed the music industry‚Äôs traditional revenue model. Beyonc√©‚Äôs unorthodox decision to release an iTunes exclusive album in the dead of night with no promotion was a brilliant (if hard to replicate) countermove by a superstar. In a social media world, free publicity is the best kind of publicity, and the combination of surprise and artificial scarcity was a great way to get people to actually open their wallets for content. It‚Äôs easy to forget now, but it‚Äôs not so long ago that Netflix looked like a doomed company, having bungled the transition from discs in the mail to streaming video with the Quickster fiasco. But they reversed course, apologized, and plunged boldly ahead into producing and purchasing original television series on a mission to become the next decade‚Äôs HBO. After a little bit of stumbling, it seems to be working. Their streaming backend gives them a unique level of insight into what kinds of things viewers might want to watch (their adaptation of "House of Cards" was¬†partially cast by algorithmic analysis), and "Orange Is The New Black" has definitively established the non-network as a potential destination for genuinely innovative programming. One big problem with Amazon‚Äôs plan for same-day delivery of small items via quadrotor drone is that they don‚Äôt have the technology working yet. Another problem is that it‚Äôs currently illegal. Announcing the nonexistent product on "60 Minutes" is a smart way to make some lemonade. Get people talking about the potential benefits of this kind of delivery and you‚Äôre doing some¬†pre-lobbying on behalf of commercial drone legalization. Blocked by the Federal Communications Commission and the Justice Department from selling its T-Mobile unit to AT&amp;T, Deutsche Telekom had to do something with the perennial laggard of the U.S. mobile phone industry. And in 2013, they did ‚Äî¬†breaking with the faux-subsidy model in which carriers offer you a high-interest loan to lock you into overpriced mobile service. Now¬†T-Mobile has the best phone plans around and amazing free data deals for tablets. The ‚Äúuncarrier‚Äù strategy has been so successful that Sprint now wants to buy them, posing a tough question for regulators ‚Äî would a merger help scale up T-Mobile‚Äôs business innovations or throttle them in the crib?
Mike Nudelman/Business InsiderBefore queuing up "Auld Lang Syne," let's reflect on 2013. The Year of the Selfie brought us a government shutdown, a new pope, intelligence leaks of unparalleled proportions, and the Hyperloop. Physics' greatest mystery ‚Äî the theory of how particles acquire mass ‚Äî was resolved. Some "leaned in," others twerked. We collectively named "Satoshi Nakamoto," the anonymous inventor of Bitcoin, Business Insider's Person of the Year. From politics to sports, entertainment, finance, and more, people have done extraordinary things this year. These are the people who impressed us the most (listed in alphabetical order).
It's safe to say 2013 turned out better than expected for the stock market. In the year to date, the S&amp;P 500 index is up over 27%. As the chart below from options guru Jared Woodard of Condor Options illustrates, 2013 was the first year in a long time that the market was able to outperform the upper end of the range implied by options at the beginning of the year. We experienced a similar situation in 2008 ‚Äî but to the downside. Check it out: Business Insider/Matthew Boesler
REUTERS/Dominick ReuterI hope I'm all set for retirement.The Federal Open Market Committeeís statement that it will begin to taper its bond purchases in January is a good sign that the US economy continues to heal, in our view. The tapering does not mean an end to the Fedís accommodative monetary policies anytime soon. It means continuing to buy bonds†at a lower monthly rate (US$75 billion, not US$85 billion). The Fed explicitly said that it now expects to maintain the current target range for the fed funds rate well past the time that unemployment rates decline below 6.5%. Volatility may rise in the short term, but in our view the US economy and markets are better positioned to absorb slightly reduced bond purchases than they were in May when the Fed first mentioned the possibility of tapering. Indeed, the market reaction to the announcement was favorableóand far different from the upset caused when the Fed first discussed the possibility in May., After all, US economic growth picked up in the second half of 2013, Congress is close to a budget agreement, consumer and business confidence is rising, and unemployment has declined from 7.6% in May to 7.0% in November. Longer-term bond yields have risen about 1.0% since the possibility of tapering was first mentioned in May, but US equity markets are at all-time highs and currency markets are stable. We think that rates are likely to stay range bound until the Fed raises short-term interest rates (currently at all-time lows), which is unlikely to happen until sometime in 2015. What Tapering Means for Bonds High-grade bond returns have been generally negative so far in 2013 on concerns about the looming taper and rising interest rates. The rise in bond yields means the market is already pricing in future moves by the Fed. We donít expect negative returns to last, but we also donít expect future bond returns to approach the outsized performance of the past, when falling rates provided a sizable tailwind. Taking into account the Fedís latest information on the potential path of interest rates, we expect modestly positive returns, primarily in intermediate-term bonds, which are less rate sensitive than longer-term bonds. We think that emphasizing intermediate bonds and judicious credit selection will be critical in the period ahead. We believe that moving from bonds to cash would pose a substantial income penalty to investors, since the FOMC doesnít plan to raise short-term rates anytime soon. What Tapering Means for Stocks There may be more volatility in equity markets as rates rise over time, but we donít think that the increases will derail the equity recovery, given solid underlying company fundamentals and the improving economy. Historically, equities have done well in most periods of rising rates. Those rising-rate periods when stocks didnít fare well were typically accompanied by high levels of inflation. Today, inflation is low. We believe that the current market environment is fostering a healthy shift from higher-dividend-yielding stocks. Since talk of potential tapering began earlier this year, higher-yielding, ìdefensiveî sectors of the market have underperformed. We expect them to continue to lag the broader market. What Tapering Means for Asset Allocation In this setting, we think that a modest tactical tilt to return-seeking assets, focused on globally diversified stocks, is warranted. Low levels of equity-market volatility, low interest rates, and global stock valuations that are in line with long-term averages all support this positioning. However, stock and interest-rate hedges on a small part of the portfolio can provide protection against sharp, adverse moves in stock and bond markets.

You know you had a pair. Nick Graham, the founder of ubiquitous Joe Boxer underwear, has launched a new men's fashion line named after himself, Nick Graham. The new line, sold exclusively through its e-commerce site NickGraham.com, includes everything from tees and ties to scarves and dress shirts in bold prints. There are money clips and belt buckles and cuff links, all 3-D printed here in the U.S., and some still rocking the †Joe Boxer tagline, 'Because he can.' Graham described what he's trying to do as "post prep,"and has argued that it's time men to dress with considerably more style. Consider this a part of that larger revolution in men's wear. Now, even if you're comfortable in your khakis you should know about all this because since Graham founded Joe Boxer from his San Francisco apartment in 1985, the brand has made $7 billion world wide. He's an ideas guy. ìItís kind of like how Joe Boxer pushed men without knowing it," Graham told Business Insider. "When I started 80% of menís underwear was bought by women. Now thatís down to 20%." † It was Graham's idea to close Fashion Week in 1999 by flying 300 people to Iceland for a total blow out fashion show on an air plane hangar. It was also his idea to take over Times Square with Richard Branson in 1995. For that adventure, Graham was dressed as the Queen England, Branson was wearing a kilt, and with 14 bagpipers going strong a crane lifted them 200 feet in the air while they gave away free stuff. Graham sold Joe Boxer to Windsong Allegiance Group in 2001. Since then he's stayed on as a consultant, done some smaller projects, bought into a perfume plantation in Borneo... you know, the usual boring retirement. He's getting back in the game now because the game has changed. In a world of problem-solving startups and bypassing the man, Graham sees nothing but vast potential in e-commerce. "7th Avenue hasn't shown up," he said, adding later, "People say to me: 'You're going into the E-Commerce space? It's so saturated'... but to me, all I see is wide open space." When you sell your brand through a Macy's or Nordstrom the store decides everything ó what is sold, where and when. And as one would expect, "all they care about is profit margins," Graham explained. That's why he decided to join the ranks of the Warby Parkers and the Bonobos of the world. Those brands are killing it, and they're getting attention for their innovation from the huge retailers who've realized it's better to join them than try to beat them. Last year, Nordstrom lead a $16.4 million round of funding for Bonobos. Just as with Joe Boxer, Nick Graham the brand will come with a distinct spirit attached to it. A QR code on each item will take shoppers to a lifestyle page where they can win a $10,000 vacation to London, New York and another destination yet known. Anyone named Nick Graham will get 50% off everything on the site, and Graham's trying to figure out how to give away a trip to NYC to run NickGraham.com for two weeks. He's also decided to hire people named Nick Graham to work on the project alongside him... 'because he can.'
Wikimedia CommonsThis month, just as Argentines were preparing for summer vacation, they received news that surely put a damper on the travel plans of more than a few of them. The government announced it was raising its tax on overseas tourist packages and the goods and services its citizens buy abroad. Faced with plummeting foreign reserves, the tax hike is the most recent effort by the South American nation to keep inflation-spooked Argentines from pulling money out of the country. The government is right to be concerned. In 2013 alone, reserves have plunged more than $12 billion to $31 billion, down from around $50 billion two years ago. The pace of outflows has risen for a variety of reasons, Credit Suisseís Argentina economic and political analyst Casey Reckman writes in a recent report called ìArgentina: How Low Will Reserves Go?î Foremost among them: debt service, rising energy imports, a surge in credit card purchases abroad, lower gold prices, and an artificially high exchange rate that hurts exports. Itís a problem more than a decade in the making. Argentina has yet to find its way back into the good graces of international financial markets since it defaulted on $132 billion in foreign debt in 2001. The resulting lack of external financing has forced the country to use existing foreign exchange reserves to repay creditors and fund imports. Tourism whittles down reserves, too, as plenty of Argentinians travel to purchase things more cheaply abroad than they can at home. ìArgentina is an extraordinarily expensive place to live, and there are no dollars,î says Riordan Roett, director of the Latin American Studies Program at Johns Hopkins University. ìI donít see an easy way out for this government.î The administrationís most pressing task is to stop the hemorrhaging or risk being unable to afford fuel imports or debt payments. As a result, officials are attempting to repair Argentinaís standing in international financial markets. In February, Argentina became the first country ever to come under International Monetary Fund sanction for providing inaccurate inflation and GDP data. The country plans to introduce a new national consumer price index which it has worked on with the IMF by early next year. Argentina also aims to negotiate a settlement with the Paris Club of creditor nations, to whom it still owes billions of dollars, and is working on compensating Repsol for the 2012 seizure of its stake in YPF. The second prong is an effort to get the official exchange rate to converge with the parallel rate. The central bank manages Argentinaís exchange rate, but they have been allowing it to depreciate recently. Limiting foreign currency transactions remains an important part of the strategy for the time being. Argentines must apply to receive dollars at the official exchange rate. The governmentís latest effort to dissuade Argentines from purchasing foreign currency or spending money overseas was an increase in the tax on those transactions from 20 percent to 35 percent. Lawmakers are also expected to approve tax hikes on luxury goods such as yachts and imported automobiles. But those measures probably wonít be enough. Reckman thinks Argentinaís gross international reserves could fall to $26.1 billion by the end of next year and to a mere $15.1 billion by the time the next president takes office in December 2015. The pesoís depreciation means the inflation outlook isnít likely to improve, which could encourage wealthier Argentines to continue seeking to pull even more money out of the country. Credit Suisse forecasts that privately estimated inflation will increase towards 30 percent in 2014, compared with just under 26 percent in November. Reckman doesnít see any short-term prospects for large new capital inflows that could help reverse the situation. Plans to compensate Spanish oil and gas giant Repsol for nationalizing its stake in Argentine energy company YPF may help attract more foreign direct investment, but ìit could take months to sign deals with foreign companies and even longer for those investments to have an impact on Argentinaís trade balance,î she says in a note this month called ìArgentina Trip Notes.î Reckman believes Argentina should be able to keep making debt payments for the next two years, but there is little room for error given the low levels of reserves ñ particularly if capital outflows accelerate. In that event, the government would have little choice but to devalue the peso or hustle a little harder to smooth over relations with the Paris Club and holdout bondholders and hopefully regain access to international markets, which could help stave off a default ìIf reserves decline more quickly than expected, the government would sooner carry out a large devaluation than default ahead of presidential elections in October 2015,î Reckman says. While she certainly wants exports to become more competitive, President Cristina Fernandezís lame-duck government will likely hold off on a large, one-off currency devaluation for as long as possible, says Reckman, choosing instead to allow the exchange rate to fall. The nominal exchange rate is expected to fall around 30 percent by the end of this year and even more quickly in 2014, Credit Suisse says. Some have suggested that Argentina create a separate exchange rate for tourism, luxury goods and possibly financial transactions that would be weaker than the current official rate, but talk of a multiple-rate regime has recently died down. Policymakers could also curtail subsidies of public services and utilities to bolster public finances, but any progress on that front is likely to be gradual given the political sensitivity of reducing social benefits. In the meantime, the government has instituted limits on the amount of pesos banks can lend to big exporters to encourage foreign companies to bring dollars into the country instead. Thereís also the possibility that an Argentinian default infects the whole region. In the 1980s, Mexico, Argentina and Brazil all defaulted on debt payments, and the International Monetary Fund was forced to eventually intervene with loan programs to many countries in the 1990s. And the Asian crisis of 1997 started when Thailandís currency collapse spread to a handful of other countries. The good news? That kind of domino effect is unlikely to occur today, says Johns Hopkinsí Roett. For starters, a number of countries, including Mexico, Chile and Colombia, have much healthier stocks of reserves that could withstand any initial fallout from the problems in Argentina. Whatís more, the region has benefitted from a general shift away from a tendency to tighten fiscal and monetary policy during downturns ñ the austerity model that Europe has been following ñ and instead turning to expansionary policies. So Argentinaís neighbors donít have to worry as much as they once might have about the countryís latest financial troubles. But that doesnít mean Argentina and its creditors can worry any less.
REUTERS/Umit BektasTurkey's Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan addresses members of his ruling AK Party (AKP) during a meeting in Ankara November 29, 2013.Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan Saturday warned some foreign ambassadors he might expel them over "provocative actions," amid mounting tensions over an anti-graft probe "Some ambassadors are engaged in provocative actions ... Do your job," Erdogan said in televised remarks in the Black Sea city of Samsun. "We don't have to keep you in our country." Erdogan's remarks were considered a veiled threat to US Ambassador Francis Ricciardone who, according to some pro-government media outlets, told some European Union envoys that Washington warned state-owned Halkbank to cut its ties with sanctions-hit Iran. The chief executive of Halkbank, Suleyman Aslan, was one of scores of people, including the sons of Erdogan cabinet ministers, who have been arrested in a high-profile bribery investigation that went to the heart of the government, which has been in power since 2002. Aslan was charged early Saturday with taking bribes, the Hurriyet newspaper said without elaborating. Judges in Istanbul also charged the sons of Interior Minister Muammer Guler, Baris Guler, and of Economy Minister Zafer Caglayan, Kaan Caglayan, with acting as intermediaries in order to give and take bribes, the Hurriyet newspaper reported without elaborating. Azerbaijani businessman Reza Zarrab was meanwhile charged with forming a ring that bribed officials to disguise illegal gold sales to Iran via Halkbank, Hurriyet said. Police also seized $4.5 million in cash hidden in shoe boxes in Aslan's home, local media reported last week, citing judicial sources. Halkbank came under fire from some quarters in the United States for its illegal transactions to Iran but the bank had previously denied the claims. "We asked Halkbank to cut its links with Iran. They did not listen to us. You are watching the collapse of an empire," Ricciardone was quoted as telling EU ambassadors, according to Aksam, Bugun, Yeni Safak and Star newspapers. But Ricciardone on Saturday denied the media reports as "baseless allegations," in his Twitter account in the Turkish language. "Nobody should put US-Turkish relations into jepoardy through baseless allegations," he said. Copyright (2013) AFP. All rights reserved. 
derekskey via www.flickr.com creative commons ONE of the most perplexing questions of the early 21st century is this: how can the French, who invented joie de vivre, the three-tier cheese trolley and Dior's jaunty New Look, be so resolutely miserable? To outsiders, the world's favourite tourist destination embodies the triumph of pleasure over desk-slavery, slow food over fast, the life of the fl√¢neur over that of the frenetic. Yet polls suggest that the French are more depressed than Ugandans or Uzbekistanis, and more pessimistic about their country's future than Albanians or Iraqis. A global barometer of hope and happiness puts the French second to bottom of a 54-country world ranking, behind austerity-battered Italians, Greeks and Spaniards, and ahead only of Portugal. Happiness is of course a slippery concept. Asked if they are happy, people everywhere are more than likely to say yes; far fewer say that they laugh much. Gallup, a pollster, has devised a global "positive experience index", based on whether respondents report that they laughed and smiled a lot or did something enjoyable the previous day. By such measures, France does better than the world average. But take out war-torn or poor countries, and measure the French against fellow rich nations, and they still turn out to be unhappier than their peers. The French report fewer "happy experiences" than those in America, Britain, Germany, Switzerland, Sweden, Canada, Norway, the Netherlands, Austria and Belgium. The land of the bon vivant is an unhappy outlier. Claudia Senik, a French economist at the Paris School of Economics, calls this the "French unhappiness puzzle". In a 2013 study, she found that the French were not only unhappier than their level of wealth and unemployment would suggest, but also more discontented than French-speaking people in Belgium and Canada (so language is not the reason), and more miserable when they emigrated compared with non-French expatriates in the same place (so they take their gloom with them). "Unhappiness seems to be more than about life in France," Ms Senik concluded. "It is something about being French." Naturally, Ms Senik's findings caused a stir in France, prompting Maureen Dowd, a New York Times writer who was visiting Paris at the time, to report that "joie de vivre has given way to gaze de navel". Le Monde ran three pages under the title "Libert√©, √âgalit√©, Morosit√©", in a bid to decode its fellow countrymen's "persistent melancholy". France, it turns out, has the highest suicide rate in western Europe after Belgium and Switzerland. An American psychiatric study showed that, among ten rich countries, the French were the most likely to have a "major depressive episode" at some point in their life. Even the French language seems to be particularly well stocked--morosit√©, tristesse, malheur, chagrin, malaise, ennui, m√©lancolie, anomie, d√©sespoir--with negativity. Can there really be something about being French that makes for so much gloom? Two periods in France's recent history have contributed most to the rich seam of misery in its culture--one after the revolution, the other after the second world war. In the quarter-century from the fall of the ancien r√©gime in 1789 to 1814, France overthrew a monarchy, endured the Terror, and lost an empire. After this period the Romantic movement, from Baudelaire to Chopin, expressed a melancholy infused with nostalgia and ambivalence towards a society dominated by rationalist thought and bourgeois values. In "Ren√©", a novel published in 1802, Chateaubriand introduced to the world the tortured French youth, whose "wretched, barren, and disenchanted" existence embodied what the writer called the mal du si√®cle. In his memoirs, Chateaubriand recognised that he had set more of a trend than he had bargained for: Romantic miserabilism was experienced as a form of pleasure. "Melancholy", wrote Victor Hugo, "is the happiness of being sad." It was treated as a noble state, a higher aesthetic condition. "I do not pretend that joy cannot be allied with beauty," wrote Baudelaire in his diary. "But I do say that joy is one of its most vulgar ornaments; whereas melancholy is, as it were, its illustrious companion." Much of this tradition is firmly fixed in today's French mind. Hugo's poem "Melancholia" is required reading for French lyc√©e students, as is Alfred de Musset's "La Nuit de Mai", whose narrator laments that "Nothing makes us so great as great sorrow." The strange beauty of melancholy finds some echo in mid-20th-century France, which produced a second wave of miserabilism. Fran√ßoise Sagan's "Bonjour Tristesse", published in 1954, for instance, opens with the 17-year-old C√©cile's lament: Yet the ennui that marked this second period had less to do with nostalgia than nausea. In "L'Etranger", Albert Camus's protagonist, Mersault, is perhaps the world's best-known embodiment of anguish in the face of the unknowable meaning of existence, or the absurd. Post-war French theatre developed the absurd, through the plays of Camus, Jean Anouilh and the Franco-Romanian Eug√®ne Ionescu. Samuel Beckett, an Irishman, wrote "Waiting for Godot" in French. On a chilly winter's evening in 1953 on Paris's left bank, two years before the play went on to unsettle English-speaking audiences, it was first staged at the 75-seat Th√©√¢tre de Babylone, and struck a chord with post-war Paris. Neither Camus nor his contemporary, Jean-Paul Sartre, was ultimately a pessimist. But it is the torment of existentialism, rather than its conclusions, that captured the imagination. Indeed, the left-bank literary clique led by Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir, which gravitated to the caf√©s of Saint-Germain-des-Pr√®s, adopted ennui as a way of life as well as a philosophy. When Sartre handed the original manuscript of "Nausea" to Gallimard, his publisher, he entitled his novel "Melancholia". Perhaps the best exemplar of miserabilism among contemporary French fiction writers is Michel Houellebecq, the controversial Goncourt-prize-winning novelist, in such nihilist works as "Whatever" or "Atomised". His characters invariably lead empty, often sordid, always disillusioned lives. "In the end," writes Mr Houellebecq in "The Elementary Particles", "there's just the cold, the silence and the loneliness. In the end, there's only death." There have, of course, been periods during which the gloom lifted. It was after the double shock of the Franco-Prussian war of 1870-71 and the bloody Paris Commune, after all, that the Impressionists took their tubes of paint and brushes outdoors, delighting in light and colour. Despite a measure of fin-de-si√®cle anxiety, the belle √©poque was a moment of breezy certainty. Gustave Eiffel unveiled his wrought-iron tower in 1889. By 1900 the City of Lights drew 51m visitors to its universal exhibition, under the theme of "Paris, capital of the civilised world", and Matisse, Derain and other fauves had started to capture exuberant colour and warmth on canvas. Yet miserabilism seems to have a greater hold on the French mind today. One reason could be the French appetite for brutal self-criticism. From Descartes onwards, doubt is the first philosophical reflex. "The rationalist tradition makes us sceptical; we exist through criticism," argues Monique Canto-Sperber, a philosopher and director of Paris Sciences et Lettres, an elite university. "We treat those too full of hope as naive." In "Candide, or The Optimist", published in 1759, Voltaire mocks the folly of looking on the bright side in the face of unimaginable horrors. "Optimism", says a disabused Candide in the novel, "is the madness of insisting that all is well when we are miserable." When a French magazine recently tried to decode today's national pessimism, it concluded: "It's Voltaire's fault". "We find it more chic and more spiritual to doubt everything." Up to a point, this is an affectation of the elite. "It is in a certain Parisian milieu that there are intellectuals who are grumpy by trade," argues Jack Lang, the Socialist former culture minister: "There is a gap with the rest of French society." Yet France cherishes public intellectuals, so their influence spreads wide. It is a talking, thinking culture. Its films value dialogue over plot; its talk-shows are interminable. The French, wrote a helpful official guide for British servicemen heading to France for the 1944 liberation offensive, "enjoy an intellectual argument more than we do. You will often think that two Frenchmen are having a violent quarrel when they are simply arguing some abstract point." The country treats its philosophers like national treasures, even celebrities, splashing photographs of them across the pages of glossy magazines. And it ensures that the canon of French thought is fed to the whole country. All pupils taking the school-leaving baccalaur√©at exam must study philosophy, and teenagers are examined on such cheery essay questions as "Is man condemned to self-delusion?" or "Do we have an obligation to seek truth?". So if French intellectuals are predominantly critical pessimists, miserabilism may in part be the consequence of holding them in such esteem. Were Americans to pay more attention to the writings of Noam Chomsky and Jared Diamond, perhaps they would be gloomy too. This critical reflex reaches right into the classroom, generating a further source of negativity. In French schools, for example, the tradition is for teachers to grade harshly, and praise with excessive moderation. Under a nationwide system that awards marks out of 20, a pupil doing a dict√©e has points (or even half-points) deducted for every error; so a child swiftly ends up with zero. The idea is that all children can always do better. The result is a lack of what the French, borrowing English syntax, call "la positive attitude". Fully 75% of French pupils worry that they will get bad grades in maths tests, according to an OECD study, nudging stressed-out South Korean levels (78%). A recent government-commissioned report on a small pilot experiment in some French secondary schools, where Cartesian grading had been shelved in favour of a more encouraging system, noted with some surprise that weaker pupils were absent from school less often, more confident in the classroom, and "less stressed when faced with failure". If the French are life's critics, they are at the same time idealists, and these two make unhappy bedfellows. Thanks to the philosophers of the Enlightenment and the 1789 revolution, the concept of progress towards an ideal society has, despite periodic turmoil and bloodshed, been a powerful narrative in the French mind. The best embodiment of this is the French declaration of human rights. Unlike the American declaration of independence in 1776, which guaranteed the rights of all Americans, the French version 13 years later guaranteed the rights of all mankind. To this day, the ambition to inspire the world with a secular republican ideal, backed by the spread of French culture and language, stirs political leaders. "France is only itself when in pursuit of an ideal," wrote Dominique de Villepin, a former prime minister, in a deliberate echo of Charles de Gaulle's reference to the country's "exceptional destiny". It is great stuff for myth-making, as De Gaulle demonstrated so masterfully after liberation from Nazi occupation. But when reality does not quite match up to ideals, self-criticism kicks in and misery results. Left-wing French intellectuals never quite got over the failed revolutionary promise of the May '68 student uprising, nor their disillusion at the declining influence of French thought from the 1980s onwards. Others struggled to reconcile French values with the country's darker moments, notably under occupation. Today, "belief in a better tomorrow has come to an end," says Christophe Prochasson, a French historian. "There is a crisis of progress." Put simply, the French know that they have enjoyed a fabulous way of life, and are depressed by the thought that neither the French model, nor Europe, seems able to provide the prosperity or the national grandeur it once did. The upshot is that "we are collectively animated by a sense of doom and decline," says Dominique Mo√Øsi, of the French Institute of International Relations. "We have in mind this great nation of ours: the major power in Europe under Louis XIV and Napoleon I, the biggest allied standing army in the first world war. Now there's a sense of 'What happened to us?'." France is not alone in contemplating its diminished status. Britain had a grand past too. But the post-colonial, post-industrial British do not share the French sense of national depression, partly because they never considered their empire to be part of an effort to export a culture or a model society. And, having accidentally given the world the English language, Britain feels relaxed about its global cultural influence. The contrasting decline of French, once the language of European diplomacy, high culture and polite conversation, is felt as a national wound. Idealistic France's painful reckoning with decline is therefore quite different to the British approach of resigned muddling-through, argues Jean-Philippe Mathy, of the University of Illinois, in "Melancholy Politics". It is almost, says Mr Prochasson, the historian, a form of bereavement. "There is a very profound pessimism today due to the realisation that France is becoming a country like any other, and this is difficult." Does it matter? Certainly, France's high suicide rate is a serious cause for concern. Dissatisfaction also makes the French a particularly fractious people to govern, ready as they are to contest, and protest, at the slightest excuse. Confidence too is elusive in a country given to pessimism, making it harder still for politicians to persuade the French to try new ways of doing things. Yet pessimism has not stopped France from enjoying itself. French hedonism has survived miserabilism--or perhaps provided a refuge from it. Even in the immediate aftermath of the 1789 revolution, the country exhibited a "thirst for pleasure", as one contemporary newspaper report put it: "The stream of fashion, a succession of dinners, the luxury of their splendid furniture and their mistresses, are the objects that chiefly employ the thoughts of the young men of Paris." With firework displays, extravagant fashion, circuses and carousels, Paris at the time, for the rich at least, was all about enjoyment. During les ann√©es folles, upper-class American tourists took the steamer to Normandy and then the railway to Paris, drawn to France, writes Harvey Levenstein, a historian, as "a land that was free from American puritanism, where the pursuit of pleasure reigned supreme". Nor has miserabilism discouraged the French preoccupation with beauty and taste. France does not wear its gloom like a dreary accessory. On the contrary, its culture delights in elegance, sensuality, quality and form: the exquisite hand-stitching on the haute-couture dress; the immaculately glazed tartes aux framboises lined up in the p√¢tisserie window. The aesthetics of daily life, the art de vivre, remains a source of both grand gestures and small stolen pleasures. It is no coincidence that the two biggest luxury-goods groups in the world are French. Modern French culture may not have supplied great writers to rival Hugo or Moli√®re, and Paris may lack the buzz of New York or London. But it is hard to argue that negativity has stifled French creativity. Would France have brought the world existentialism had Sartre been a cheerful fellow? The critical impulse has promoted cultural innovation. Both cinema's New Wave and French literary theory were born of critical reconstruction of what came before. Some of France's most creative periods have followed bleak times: the flowering of painting, literature and science after its defeat in the Franco-Prussian war, or of the avant-garde in art and fashion after the horrors of the first world war. Christian Lacroix, a French designer, points out that war and revolution in France have been times of "creative reinventions, the moment new forms of luxury come into play". Perhaps the French need dissatisfaction and thrive on doubt. "There is a certain pleasure taken in being unhappy: it's part of an intellectualism of French culture," says Ms Senik. "Malaise and ennui are to France what can-do is to America: a badge of honour," wrote Roger Cohen in the New York Times recently. Pessimism does not preclude pleasure. All that sitting around at pavement caf√©s, looking fashionably discontented, can be fun. Optimism is for fools; sophisticates know better. Bleak is chic--especially when opening another bottle of Saint-Emilion and reaching for the three-tier cheese trolley. Click here to subscribe to The Economist 
Sober LookDeutsche Bank's chart of the US unemployment rate (right) received numerous comments on Twitter. Clearly the projection of the linear decline continuing at the same rate is a bit aggressive. But many of the comments were dismissive of the measure altogether - arguing that these falling unemployment levels are not that meaningful in the face of the declining labor participation rate. There is no question that labor force participation in the US has been falling as more people drop out of the workforce. But that measure could be misleading because as the population ages, the workforce will shrink naturally. For example Canada is also experiencing declines in its headline†labor force participation rate. But when adjusted for aging, its labor force participation is actually growing (see chart). Perhaps a better measure to use here is the so-called "activity rate" which is often used by OECD researchers to compare labor markets across different countries. It is defined as "the active population (employed plus unemployed) divided by the working age population." In other words, what proportion of the "working age" population is either working or is officially listed as unemployed. A decline in that rate would indicate "working-age" people leaving the workforce. And as the next chart shows, that is indeed the case (note: for those who are not happy with the 15-75 age range, rest assured that other similar ranges for working age population yield very similar results.) Sober Look This tells us that about 3.5% of the working-age population has left the labor force since the start of the Great Recession. Should those people be also counted as unemployed? If so, here is what the unemployment rate trend would look like: Sober LookIt's not clear however if the orange line above represents "true" unemployment. For example teenagers had far greater employment opportunities in the 90s than they do now, with youth labor force participation having declined sharply over the past decade. But should a 17 year-old who lives with her parents and can't find part-time work be classified as "unemployed"? Evidence suggests that a great number of the labor force "dropouts" were in the 16-19 age group. This would indicate that the "effective unemployment" rate (depending how one defines "unemployed") is somewhere between the orange and the blue charts above, with DB's projection representing the lower boundary.
REUTERS/Thomas PeterGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel (R), gestures as she stands beside designated Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen. TWELVE weeks after its election, followed by the longest coalition negotiations in its history, Germany has a new government at last. And although there was never any doubt that Angela Merkel would continue leading it as chancellor, the cabinet she chose contained a surprise: Germany's new defence minister will be Ursula von der Leyen, the first woman in that job. Mrs von der Leyen, who at 55 is four years younger than Mrs Merkel, is now the most obvious member of Mrs Merkel's party, the centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), to run for chancellor when Mrs Merkel, who is now starting her third term, steps down. Mrs von der Leyen's most likely opponent would be Sigmar Gabriel (left, above), leader of the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD). Since the SPD's poor showing in the election (it got only 25.7% of votes, against 41.5% for Mrs Merkel's camp), he has skilfully manoeuvred his party into another "grand coalition" with Mrs Merkel, wrangling concessions out of her in the process and winning a referendum of party members to approve the pact by the huge margin of 75% to 25%. Now he is vice-chancellor and minister with a newly combined portfolio of energy and the economy. This puts him in charge of Germany's biggest domestic challenge, the transition from nuclear and coal to solar and wind. As defence minister, a challenging portfolio that includes managing a continuing reform of the army, Mrs von der Leyen could build up her stature for a future run against Mr Gabriel. She will have few rivals, because the most senior cabinet posts are staying in the hands of veterans from the preceding generation. The CDU's Wolfgang Sch√§uble, 71, remains as finance minister (suggesting that little change can be expected in Germany's management of the euro crisis). The SPD's Frank-Walter Steinmeier becomes foreign minister again, the same job he held in Mrs Merkel's first term, from 2005 to 2009. Thomas de Maizi√®re, whom Mrs von der Leyen replaces and who will now become interior minister, a job he has had before, is still damaged by a procurement scandal from his time as defence minister. Petite and sprightly, Mrs von der Leyen has been close to politics her whole life, as the daughter of Ernst Albrecht, a former premier of Lower Saxony. But she personally entered politics only at 42, after living in Belgium, Britain and America, learning fluent English and French, studying and then practising gynaecology and having seven children. Since Mrs Merkel became chancellor in 2005, Mrs von der Leyen has had stints as minister of families and women, then of labour and welfare. During these years, she has proved herself unfailingly loyal to Mrs Merkel, even after a personal disappointment in 2010, when the chancellor did not nominate her for federal president as she had hoped. She also cultivated an image as the social conscience of her party. With rare bravura, she demonstrated personally how to combine work and family but also pushed policies that would help other women do the same. These views have made her popular with voters but at times less appreciated by conservatives in the CDU. To become a plausible candidate to succeed Mrs Merkel, she will first have to shore up her support within the party's base. Women are gaining a higher profile in Mrs Merkel's government more generally. Four of the SPD's cabinet positions have gone to women, with some of the portfolios dearest to party members: labour, women and integration of foreigners. In another surprise, J√∂rg Asmussen, a Social Democrat who has the German seat on the board of the European Central Bank (ECB), will return to Berlin. Mr Asmussen will be missed in Frankfurt, having acted as a bridge between the bank and the German government and voters in the euro crisis. The candidate to replace him at the ECB is another woman, Sabine Lautenschl√§ger-Peiter, the number two at the German Bundesbank. She belongs to no party, but is an expert on bank regulation who often talks out against bankers with big bonuses. Mrs Merkel has given no hints about her own career plans beyond denying some speculation that she might step down in mid-term, around the time of her tenth anniversary as chancellor. The previous CDU chancellor, Helmut Kohl, served four terms but then lost the 1998 election. Thinking of him and Konrad Adenauer, Germany's first post-war chancellor, Mrs von der Leyen has in the past evaded questions about her ambitions by saying that in the CDU "each generation has its chancellor," and hers already has Angela Merkel. If Mrs von der Leyen does her new job well, she may reconsider. Click here to subscribe to The Economist
