REUTERS Stringer.JPGYingkou, Liaoning provinceBEIJING (Reuters) - China's export growth fizzled in September to post a surprise fall as sales to Southeast Asia tumbled, data showed, a disappointing break to a recent run of indicators that had signaled its economy gaining strength. China's exports dropped 0.3 percent in September from a year earlier, the Customs Administration said on Saturday, sharply confounding market expectations for a rise of 6 percent, and marking the worst performance in three months. Imports fared better, rising 7.4 percent in September from a year ago, better than forecasts for a 7 percent increase, shrinking China's monthly trade surplus to $15.2 billion. Analysts said weak exports underscored worries about flagging global demand, which may crumble further in coming months - especially in emerging markets - when tighter U.S. monetary policy pushes investors away from developing economies. Indeed, the data showed Chinese exports to Southeast Asia, China's fastest-growing export market in the past year, dived to a 17-month low in September. Capital outflows from the region on bets that the U.S. central bank will cut its bond purchases had hit demand, said Louis Kuijs, an economist at RBS in Hong Kong. "Looking ahead, export data may be quite weak in the coming months," Kuijs said, adding that financial turmoil in several emerging markets had dragged on global demand. The dismal exports performance comes after the world's No. 2 economy showed encouraging signs of stabilization, having fought a slowdown that lasted in 12 of 14 quarters. Trade, factory production and the services sector all picked up in the past two months. For a graphic on China's trade, please click on http://link.reuters.com/ked55s Attention now turns to China's third-quarter gross domestic product data and other figures for September due next week. The median forecast of 21 economists in a Reuters poll showed economic growth is expected to quicken to 7.8 percent in the third quarter from a year ago, up from 7.5 percent in the previous three months. "Developed economies have shown signs of recovery but they are still unstable. The global economic situation is still complicated," Zheng Yuesheng, a spokesman for the customs office, told a media briefing on Saturday. Albeit patchy, the rebound in the global economy helped lift China's total trade growth to 6 percent in the third quarter, from 4.3 percent the previous three months, Zheng said. STRONG YUAN, SEASONAL FACTOR A breakdown of the data showed exports to Europe, the second-biggest buyer of Chinese good after the United States, South Korea, Taiwan, and Australia all fell last month. Shipments to Taiwan struck a 17-month low while those to Australia posted their worst growth in three months. Japan was the lone bright spot, registering growth for Chinese exporters for the first time in eight months. Sales to the United States cooled, even though the monthly value of exports were at their highest in over a year. Liu Li-Gang and Zhou Hao, economists at ANZ Bank, said China's sliding export sales were also a result of a rising yuan. They said activity was further hurt by the Mid-Autumn festival, which fell in the middle of September this year, reducing the number of working days in the month compared with 2012. "The strong renminbi has eroded China's export competitiveness," ANZ Bank said in a note. It said there were risks that China's economic growth may miss market forecasts this year, but predicted 2013 growth would hit 7.6 percent. The yuan, which hit a record high of 6.1090 to the dollar on August 12, has gained 5.7 percent against 60 other currencies since January, data from the Bank of International Settlements showed, outstripping a 3 percent rise in the dollar. In the face of China's unsteady economic recovery, Beijing has repeatedly expressed confidence that the country can still achieve its 2013 growth target of 7.5 percent. Central Bank Deputy Governor Yi Gang was quoted as saying this week in Washington that China's annual economic growth this year could hit about 7.6 percent. Analysts have long warned that a recovery in China's economy may be fragile and brief, especially if Chinese leaders stick to plans for financial reforms, including curbing extravagant investment, which would hurt growth in the near term. "Despite the subdued export outlook, we expect the government to maintain its current policy stance," said Kuijs from RBS. "We expect it to hold on to the firmer monetary stance that it is trying to pursue in order to rein in overall credit growth."

Alex Davies / Business InsiderBy the end of 2013, Bombardier should be ready to put its latest private jet, the Learjet 85, into the air for the first time. About a year after that, if all goes well, deliveries will begin. But those who can't wait to get on board the largest, tallest, widest Learjet ever, will have to go through Flexjet.¬† The fractional private jet company is the first, exclusive customer for the $20.8 million Learjet 85. Over five years, the company will take delivery of 30 of the planes. Flexjet customers can charter single flights, buy a "jet card" that works like a debit card, or purchase a fractional ownership. A 1/16 share of the Learjet 85, good for 50 hours in the air per year for five years, runs for $1.1 million.
Apple†(NASDAQ:AAPL) has been hit with a†class action lawsuit†from an Apple Store employee who alleges that the iPhone maker owes many of its workers overtime wages for off-the-clock time spent undergoing security checks and waiting in long clock-in lines, reports†Law 360. Taylor Kalin, who worked as a full-time nonexempt Apple specialist at stores in San Francisco and Spokane, filed the class action lawsuit on behalf of himself and all nonexempt hourly workers. According to the†filed complaint†via†Patently Apple, ìPlaintiff and other Hourly Employees were and are required to wait in line for security checks for at least 10-15 minutes each day before leaving for their meal breaks and at the end of their shift after they had already clocked out. This daily 10-15 minute uncompensated waiting time during security checks was done in order to undergo searches for possible contraband and/or pilferage of inventory.î Besides being subjected to off-the-clock searches, the lawsuit also noted that employees often have to spend 15 minutes or more waiting in line each time they clock in. On launch days, this waiting period could last over 30 minutes. The allegations made in this lawsuit are similar to the ones made in a lawsuit filed by two former Apple Store employees in†San Francisco federal court†earlier this year. However, the current lawsuit is a class action lawsuit that seeks compensation for lost wages for all eligible employees, as well as various civil penalties for labor violations. Although Apple employs more than 42,000 people in its retail stores, it is unclear how many would qualify for compensation under this lawsuit. It is also unknown if Appleís practice of searching employees off the clock is done in its overseas Apple Store locations. Hereís how Apple closed out the trading week on Friday. Yahoo Finance

Last week, BofA Merrill Lynch interest rate strategist Ruslan Bikbov recommended clients take advantage of the quiet in markets†by selling gamma (i.e., shorting volatility). The argument was that the fiscal crisis in Washington, D.C. was actually causing market volatility to decline because it was ensuring that the Federal Reserve would hold off on beginning to taper back its quantitative easing program until 2014. But that was a week ago, and there's been very little progress in Washington. Now, Bikbov is no longer recommending clients sell gamma, "as risk-reward from selling vol no longer looks attractive with the October 17 debt ceiling deadline approaching." In a note to clients, he writes: We expect the market to become increasingly anxious as the deadline nears. To be sure, if the debt ceiling is not raised before the deadline passes, it will not lead to an immediate default, as the government should still have about $127bn of payment capacity on that day and we expect the Treasury will continue to meet its obligations until at least November 1. But knowing this, key players in the negotiations may view not reaching a deal before the deadline passes as an acceptable option. However, the risk of a missed payment on Treasury obligations should increase dramatically after October 17 given uncertainty about government revenues. So we expect a large-scale risk-off market move if the deadline passes without a resolution. On the other hand, reaching a deal in time could lead to a relief market selloff, which may also bring volatilities higher. Deutsche Bank chief U.S. equity strategist David Bianco says the S&amp;P 500 either falls to 1650 or climbs to 1725 in a "high stakes week ahead." Read more here ª
Nearly all of Wall Street is optimistic about the prospects for the stock market in the coming years. Monday, the S&amp;P 500 closed at 1676. The median 2014 year-end target for the index among Wall Street equity strategists, according to a poll by Bloomberg, is 1900 ‚Äî 13% above today's levels. Thus, a new report from Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale's asset allocation team ‚Äî which calls for a 15% correction in the stock market in the first quarter of next year, followed by a multi-year journey back to where the index sits today ‚Äî may come as a bit of a shock. SG Cross Asset Research/Global Asset AllocationSocGen's new S&P 500 price targets.In the report ‚Äî titled "S&amp;P 500: -15% in sight, then the big sleep" ‚Äî¬†SocGen's global head of asset allocation, Alain Bokobza, explains how an unwind of easy money policies at the Federal Reserve and ongoing dysfunction in Washington will cause the stock market to languish. "Strategically, we advise investors to switch into eurozone and Japanese equities, where economic policy is much clearer, monetary policy very loose and positioning is low," says Bokobza. The strategist lays out the case in the report: Between now and the end of the year, any decline in the S&amp;P 500 is likely to be limited given that the Fed is still injecting liquidity. We expect the S&amp;P to be at 1600 by year-end, in line with our technical analyst‚Äôs forecast (1560+/-10pts). SG economists expect the January FOMC meeting to be the most likely timeframe for tapering. They look for the first move to be $20bn (instead of the $5-10bn previously expected by the market). We expect the drop to accelerate at the start of 2014 as the market starts pricing in the end of asset purchases (i.e. well before the market‚Äôs Fed tapering expectation). The S&amp;P 500 should dip to 1450 on our estimates, down c.15% from the peak. Keep in mind the S&amp;P 500 fell by -16% after QE1 stopped and by -17% after the end of QE2. From Q2 2014, the S&amp;P 500 should start to recover slowly after a technical rebound (c.+7%), as 'Growth' returns to the forefront. We see the S&amp;P 500 at 1600 by the end of the year, so 2014 should be rather flat. In the two to three years that follow, the U.S. equity index should remain relatively flat, burdened by higher yields (rate hikes in mid-2015), a higher U.S. dollar and limited earnings growth (Return on Equity is already high), but supported by better economic prospects and a new shareholder value cycle, staving off a bear market. The SocGen report calls Fed tightening "a cap on the U.S. equity market," pointing to liquidity as "the main driver of U.S. equities since 2008." Simply put, stocks will not be able to handle higher interest rates. "U.S. equities have been able to absorb the recent increase in the [10-year] bond yield without panic thanks to a high equity risk premium," says Bokobza. "The U.S. equity risk has dropped from 6.8% to 4.7% over the last 10 months. According to our proprietary risk premium model, U.S. equities can absorb only c.80 [basis points] more; i.e., a bond yield of around 3.4% (to normalise our risk premium at its long-term average)." The surge in long-term interest rates that accompanied a big sell-off in the Treasury market this summer as investors anticipated a tapering of quantitative easing did not weigh much on the stock market, but the 10-year yield only made it to 3.0%. Datastream, SG Cross Asset Research/Global Asset AllocationNote: Red line = linear regression. Return on Equity = 12-month forward earnings/current book value.SocGen says the U.S. stock market ‚Äî along with Switzerland's ‚Äî is the most expensive in the entire world, as the chart at left illustrates. ¬† "We continue to find some value in U.S. equities, but we particularly like financial sectors," writes Bokobza. "The rest of the market is now back to pre-crisis levels, trading at 3.2x book value. Over the last 30 years, the only period non-financial U.S. stocks traded higher was during the dot-com bubble (1997-2001), when markets entered into a period of 'irrational exuberance'." From a fundamental standpoint, SocGen argues that it's becoming increasingly difficult for companies to deliver on earnings expectations. "While the profitability of U.S. companies is already relatively high, earnings momentum remains in negative territory and is decreasing," says Bokobza. "It will be increasingly difficult for U.S. companies to beat consensus expectations. Last year earnings growth expectations for 2012 and 2013 were revised down sharply from the double-digit level. The consensus expects 10% earnings growth for 2014 and 2015." But what about the Great Rotation? "There is more money in U.S. equities now than in 2007 (not the case for European equities)," writes Bokobza. "Everyone has found good reasons to buy U.S. equities, even if some of those reasons are incompatible with one another: economic recovery, monetary stimulus, energy revolution, safe haven area or simply a lack of alternatives." "After gaining 170% since March 2009, we believe that U.S. equities are a tired and crowded asset now." EPFR, SG Cross Asset Research/Global Asset Allocation

Since the passing of its charismatic leader, Hugo Chavez, Venezuela has stayed out of most U.S. headlines. That should change, as the policies of President Nicolas Maduro have started to raise some serious red flags. In April, Maduro beat his opponent in Venezuela's presidential election, Henrique Capriles Radonski,¬†with the lowest margin of support in years. ¬† His predecessor, Chavez, had not only been the leader of Venezuela, but also a leader of the Latin American left. Chavez symbolized an ideology that believed in the rigor and potential of a region united to find alternatives to a U.S. dominated, unipolar world. Maduro lacks that spark. And he also faces the highest inflation rate in the world (at 49.4% in September). To combat this rate, the former bus driver turned statesman has asked Venezuela's legislators to grant him sweeping powers. From Bloomberg: The decree would enable Maduro to either deepen state control of the economy or loosen foreign exchange controls to stimulate production, said¬†Asdrubal Oliveros, director of Caracas-based research group Ecoanalitica. The governing coalition of late President Hugo Chavez is one vote short of the three-fifths majority required by the constitution to pass the so-called enabling law used for special presidential powers. Assembly President Diosdado Cabello said after Maduro‚Äôs speech that he‚Äôs confident the law will be approved. Opposition leader Henrique Capriles Radonski, who won 49 percent of the vote in April‚Äôs presidential election, warned the government against pushing through the bill without a three-fifths majority. ‚ÄúThe government would have to come in with tanks and rifles if they want to apply this enabling law,‚Äù he said in his weekly address broadcast on the Internet. ¬†Maduro presented this as a decree against corruption.¬† Now, to put this is context, Chavez himself ruled through these powers for over four years of his presidency, but as Nomura put it in a note earlier this month, "Post election tensions continue to run high, casting doubt over Nicolas Maduro's ability to grasp firmly over the reins of power." In other words, Maduro does not have the legitimacy that Chavez had. He does not, as Capriles Radonski suggested, have the authority to push these sweeping powers through without a three-fifths majority.¬† As such, Nomura has placed Venezuela on a list of 10 countries to watch for unrest, along with China, India, Argentina, South Africa, Russia, and more. Maduro seems to know this. Argentine news service Clarin reported yesterday that Maduro advocated jail time for journalists who reported shortages of natural gas back in 2001.¬†Shortages of electricity and toilet paper (among other items) have become common in the country. These are the actions of an administration that cannot suffer even the slightest suggestion of descent. Alo Presidente.¬† ¬†
REUTERS/Ralph OrlowskiDeutsche Bank Co-chief Executive Anshu Jain WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Three of the world's most powerful bankers warned of terrible consequences if the†United States†defaults on its debt, with Deutsche Bank chief executive†Anshu Jain†claiming default would be "utterly catastrophic." "This would be a very rapidly spreading, fatal disease," Jain said on Saturday at a conference hosted by the†Institute of International Finance†in Washington. "I have no recommendations for this audience...about putting band aids on a gaping wound," he said. Jain, JPMorgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon and Baudouin Prot, chairman of BNP Paribas, said a default would have dramatic consequences on the value of U.S. debt and the dollar, and likely would plunge the world into another recession. The U.S. Treasury Department has said it expects to max out its borrowing authority next week and won't be able to prioritize payments on U.S. debt over obligations like Social Security. Lawmakers have seemed at an impasse over raising the debt limit. Democrats want to re-open federal agencies, which have been partially closed since funding ran out on October 1, and Republicans insist any debt ceiling deal includes plans to cut government spending. Dimon and other top executives from major U.S. financial firms met with President†Barack Obama†and with lawmakers last week to urge them to deal with both issues. On Saturday, Dimon said banks are already spending "huge amounts" of money preparing for the possibility of a default, which he said would threaten the global recovery after the 2007-2009 financial crisis. "We need global growth," he said. "We are on the verge of getting it. Please let's not shoot ourselves in the foot." Dimon also defended JPMorgan against critics who say the bank has become too big to manage. It has come under scrutiny from numerous regulators and on Friday reported its first quarterly loss since Dimon took over, due to more than $7 billion in legal expenses.
Congressional Budget OfficeIn the two weeks since a faction of Congress shut the government down and began threatening to cause the country to default, the conversation has changed. First, the Republicans' demand was that the Affordable Care Act, a.k.a. Obamacare, be "defunded" or delayed. Now, the Republican demand is that the government cut spending to rein in the country's debt and deficit. The debt and deficit has not been a topic of national conversation for a while ó in part because our deficit has actually been shrinking fast ó so this is a good time to review where things stand. The bottom line is this: Here are the facts (See charts below): † So, at some point, our government will have to come together to figure out an intelligent long-term plan to deal with our long-term problem. This plan does NOT, however, need to cut spending or increase revenue immediately. Let's go to the charts... CHART 1: First, here's our debt-to-GDP ratio. As you can see, we currently have a high debt-to-GDP ratio, but not an unprecedented one. We had a higher one after World War 2, and that worked out fine. Congressional Budget Office CHART 2: Here's our annual deficit as a percent of GDP. As you can see, it ballooned during the Bush years and financial crisis, but it is now shrinking again. This year, the deficit is expected to shrink all the way to 4% of GDP, the lowest since 2004. St. Louis Fed, Business Insider CHART 3: Here's the deficit presented as the gap between revenue and expenses. As you can see, the deficit has narrowed considerably, and it is expected to continue to shrink for the next few years. Then, if nothing is done, it will start to grow again. Congressional Budget Office CHART 4: And here's a debt projection. Debt as a percentage of GDP is about to peak, and then it should shrink for several years. After 2016, if we don't have a long-term plan, it will start to grow again. Congressional Budget Office CHART 5: This chart shows the components of projected spending. It makes clear that the future budget busters will be our healthcare and social programs, as well as the interest we will incur on the debt we take on to pay for them. Other spending is expected to shrink as a percentage of GDP, which may actually hurt the country. Congressional Budget Office CHART 6: Lastly, here's the long-term view. If we don't develop a long-term plan to either reduce healthcare spending or raise revenue (or a combination), our debt really will become unsustainable. So we do have a long-term debt and deficit problem. But we don't have a short-term one. Congressional Budget Office † SEE ALSO: Here's Who We Owe That $17 Trillion Of Government Debt To
REUTERS/ Pascal LauenerGoldman Sachs Chairman and CEO Lloyd BlankfeinGoldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein finally revealed what he does during the weekends, in a new video posted by the investment bank. During a discussion with the summer analyst class, one of the London-based interns pointed out that Blankfein had said he likes to read a lot of biographies and many of these books tend to discuss the subjects daily habits.¬† So the intern asked Blankfein to spill about what he does on the weekends.¬† Blankfein told the group that he's constantly traveling around the world and reading massive briefing books along the way. He also has to take a lot of calls and answer emails throughout the weekend. ¬† As for his social life, a lot of his friends tend to be other industry leaders.¬† Sometimes, though, he prays for rainy days so he can just chill on the couch.¬† It sounds pretty intense, but that's probably part of the job.¬† Here's Blankfein:¬† "This job is pretty consuming. Last week, I mean I don't want to tell my sad story to you. But last week I was in China, since I was so close I stopped in on Sydney on the way back, which is only 11 hours away in the wrong direction. So I spend a lot of time at this and on Saturday I go to Europe again. When I'm on the plane, you think I'm reading all those...See, people say things that are different from what they do. I tell you how I like to read this stuff. But I'll tell you when I'm on the plane I'm reading my notes for the meetings I'm going to have. "If you look at what I do, I go out I like to run and laugh and jump with the other boys and girls and play golf and do all those things and talk to my kids and lie on the couch. Sometimes I pray for a rainy day so I don't feel guilty about lying on the couch is what I really want to do. "But come Sunday, which it may be depending on the time of the year, the football game will be on or I'm doing it in the morning or the early evening I'm living my next week. I get big briefing books over the weekend with the meetings that I have and notes on it and who they are and they may expect that I know something and I will and I do. There's consequence. It's not just window dressing. I'll get caught up. But that takes time. ¬†And I can't do that five minutes before I'm scheduled to see somebody because my day goes blump, blump, blump...So on Sunday I go through my week and I remind myself during the week..."¬† "Also, the weekend and off time is the time when people sort of like lining up for approvals. Everyone knows there's a lot of processes, commitments, committee.... ¬†Let me tell you, those committees are the last step in the long process because there's a lot of trial balloon and testing and socializing some things. So if somebody has a kind of a hairy situation or a context of whether they're worried we should do this or not or whether if will get approved or not, you're working on that long memo now at this stage in your career. In the course of that memo evolving, people are testing and trying out ideas. That happens a lot on the weekends. There's a lot of voicemail traffic back in forth. ¬†"I'm thinking of doing this in this country with these people. This is a little sketchy because of this. We're taking a risk here. The client really wants us to do that. I'm not so sure. What should we advise? What business election? Should we choose this client or that client to represent in an auction? you know etc."¬†Those things get socialized. Now that's just a word...Means there's a lot of conversation and dialogue. And that's not like that's what you're doing. You're doing other things at the same time. While you're out and about, the phone rings and someone is running something by you and you're sort of saying well you're not giving a final answer this kind based on what you're saying this is how I'm leaning this is what I'd think. ¬†They go away and develop the facts more. They go out and you tell them they better adjust the facts... That's also a process that's always happening in this firm. That's kind of a gray background noise of stuff that's going on in the firm away from the crisp decision making process you observe and that you prepare for... "¬† "There's another element where you get to me my age and you personal and business life kind of converge. So that you can't be doing what I'm doing and engaging with other business leaders without becoming friends. And when I go out and socialize, just like people you do that you're friendly with, I do with people who I engage with. Some people you work with and help it's a crisp business relationship and sometimes you just like people and you develop a personal relationship with them. Sometimes somebody says 'Is that business or not?' and I said, 'You know, hard to figure out.' Because I'm talking about converging business interests with people and they're also my social friends that his stage because that's just the way it is. You go through times in your life and most of the new friends you make are kids that go to school with you, then it's people you work with and then it's the parents of the kids who your kids are going to school with and you get to another stage of your life and it's business relationships because that's what's filling up your plate."¬† It sounds like a lot. ¬† However, Blankfein compared this lifestyle to listening to music and doing something else at the same time.¬† "You're not staring at the speaker listening to music, you're doing something else," he said, adding, "A lot of this stuff is just‚Äîpeople say multi-taking‚ÄîI think of it as white noise in the background of your life."¬†
I really liked this way of thinking about trending markets courtesy of the Michael Platt chapter in Jack Schwager's excellent¬†Hedge Fund Market Wizards. ¬†Platt founded the $25 billion hedge fund BlueCrest thirteen years ago. It is one of the¬†ten largest hedge funds¬†in the world and has become well known for its dedication to risk management. Here's Platt (emphasis mine): One of the only things I could say with certainty was that markets trend because I can observe trends in any financial market, in any time era.¬†You could go back 150 years in cotton futures, and there are trends everywhere. The same is true for equities, bonds, short-term rates, everything. It seems illogical that markets trend. Markets should discount all information and then be static waiting for the next piece of information before changing price level. But that is not what they do. And the reason they trend is because our minds just don't work properly.¬†We make an estimation of the future based on all of the knowledge we have of the past at the current moment... If the market is going up today, your forecast is going to be that it will continue going up because it is how you feel at the moment that is the most important thing. Today becomes how you felt in the past because you misremember, So everything is about today.¬†If it is going up today, it will go up tomorrow. In this sense, financial markets become self-referential. Michael nails it here. I see this kind of thing everyday, writ large, in real-life. People (including myself) think about the next day or week in terms of what is happening right now. Watch an hour of financial television on a green day for the markets, you'll hear confidence in the voices of almost all of the guests. Then watch for an hour on a day in which an economic report misses forecasts or the Fed says the wrong thing, you will pick up on the caution that has crept into everyone's demeanor - even the names and themes of the segments are skewed negatively to "match" the prevailing feeling of the day. You're only human, you should not expect to be able to overcome this cognitive bias all the time. But I find that just being aware of it - within yourself and among the people around you - might be good enough. Markets trend because we overemphasize the relevance of what's happening today and act accordingly the next day by repeating the same actions - buying on the way up, selling on the way down. The "reasons" we assign to explain our actions and the embellished narratives we create around them are only there for decoration.
APSenate Democrats have rejected a proposal by moderate Republican Sen. Susan Collins (Maine) to raise the debt ceiling and reopen the government. The two sides in the Senate disagree over issues of timing. As reported by Politico, Collins is seeking a two-year delay of the medical device tax in the Affordable Care Act but would only extend the debt ceiling deadline through January and fund the government through March. Democrats do not view that as an equitable trade. Collins and Senate Democrats also disagree on spending levels. Democrats already consider the $986 billion level for 2014 discretionary spending that has been used in most House and Senate bills to be a concession.†(Discretionary spending is all spending other than programs whose costs are determined by formulas that Congress is not required to reauthorize each year, such as Social Security.) The Collins plan would cut that figure to $967 billion. "On the merits there is virtually nothing in it for us," a senior Senate Democratic aide tells Business Insider, "given that weíve already passed a clean [continuing resolution] and Republicans are now pregnant on the concept of a clean debt limit increase." That second part is a reference to the fact that Republican leadership in the House has been pushing for a six-week debt limit increase without policy concessions, and many Republicans, including Speaker John Boehner, have been sending signals that they are not really willing to allow the country to hit the debt limit. With Republicans signalling that they aren't actually willing to breach the debt limit, it's hard for Democrats to justify giving them much in return for an increase. But further negotiations in the Senate probably remain the best hope for reopening the government and raising the debt ceiling before the Oct. 17 deadline. Reid and McConnell are said to be talking to hopefully work out something. All eyes have been on the Senate since House Republicans wrapped up a meeting Saturday morning where their leader John Boehner informed the caucus that there is still no "deal" with The White House to reopen the government or lift the debt ceiling. At the meeting, Boehner along with other members of House GOP leadership slammed their Senate Republican counterparts for apparently being willing to work with the The White House, according to reports.
Gold prices plunged on Friday morning on volume so big that the CME had to halt trading. Lately, gold has been exhibiting some violent moves and UBS's veteran trader Art Cashin thinks there's something weird going on. Here's Cashin via King World News: Well, it (gold) is under some pressure.† And while I am far from being a conspiracy theorist, I could see where some of the people involved in that asset class would be concerned because weíve had several incidences of very large sales. And they all seem to come at approximately the same time in the relatively early morning in New York, usually before the stock market has opened.† The question there is, why would you suddenly dump a large amount of gold?† Why wouldnít you try to piecemeal it out over the (course of the) day? So, if that happens once it could be an accident of technology, or it could be a simple error.† But when it happens 5 times over a period of months, it does raise questions.† Is it being done purposefully?† Is somebody trying to send a message?† Is somebody trying to influence the market? We donít have enough details, but as I say, as a guy who doesnít ordinarily believe in conspiracy theories, I think there should be some further investigation as to who is selling, and why always at that time?

JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) ‚Äî The federal government shutdown that has idled hundreds of thousands of workers is starting to ripple through states, which are now laying off employees and warning of thousands of additional furloughs if the budget stalemate is not resolved soon. The trickle-down effects highlight the extent to which states are dependent on the federal government. In many states, federal money comprises about a third of all revenues. As federal dollars dry up, so do state programs. Across the nation, about a dozen states already have furloughed hundreds of employees whose paychecks depend on federal money. The layoffs have hit civilians at state National Guard bureaus, workplace safety inspectors and state workers who determine eligibility for Social Security disability benefits, among others. More state employees could be furloughed this coming week. "For me, it couldn't have come at a worse time," said Tammy Turner-Lee, a 54-year-old supervisor in Oklahoma's disability determination office who is targeted to be furloughed on Friday. "My husband is going through chemotherapy right now. ... If we are in furlough status, that means I am going to have to go into credit card debt." Medicaid, the biggest federally funded state program, has remained exempt from the cutbacks. But federal officials have said other big state-administered programs ‚Äî like food aid for low-income families ‚Äî may have only enough money to make it through October. As Congress and President Barack Obama remain at odds over the federal budget, some states have started to prepare for widespread furloughs. Arkansas already has laid off 673 employees and could furlough an additional 4,000 if the federal shutdown continues for another week. "The state of Arkansas simply does not have the resources to continue to cover the costs of federal programs," Arkansas Gov. Mike Beebe wrote in a recent memo to agency directors. Some states have avoided furloughs by tapping into accumulated federal funds while others are dipping into state coffers. Maryland has continued to pay 11,000 employees because the Legislature set aside $100 million to plug holes created by federal budget battles. Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback dipped into cash reserves to avoid 119 furloughs and reinstate dozens of others in an office that handles unemployment benefits. But Florida Gov. Rick Scott took the opposite approach, ordering agencies not to use state money to cover typical federal expenses. Furloughs of state workers are slowly mounting. There have been 56 so far Maine, more than 100 in Illinois, 244 in Arizona, more than 300 in Virginia and over 400 in Washington. The disability office in Oklahoma's Department of Rehabilitation Services, where Turner-Lee works, halted its outgoing mail to stretch its dwindling federal dollars. But furloughs could kick in by week's end for 289 full-time and 39 temporary state employees. The Oklahoma shutdown would affect nearly 18,000 people waiting for word on whether they can get disability benefits. The entire staff of the Maine disability determination office already has been furloughed, meaning people with disabilities "are going to incur additional financial hardship," said Sara Squires, the public affairs director at the nonprofit Disability Rights Center in Augusta, Maine. Other states such as Pennsylvania, Missouri and Michigan still are bracing for a big hit from the federal shutdown. About 200 maintenance employees of the Missouri National Guard already are furloughed, but the state has several thousand additional federally funded employees. The key date in Michigan in Oct. 20. If nothing is resolved by then, state officials will begin reviewing which 15,000 to 20,000 employees to furlough. "If we are still in the same position a week from now, we've got some very real problems and concerns," said Kurt Weiss, a spokesman for the Michigan budget office. Furloughed federal workers could eventually get paid if Congress later approves retroactive wages. But state workers dependent on federal funds could face complications because of quirks in local laws or collective bargaining contracts. In Minnesota, some 100 Department of Health workers have received notices warning they may be laid off. So have 67 employees of the Minnesota Department of Military Affairs. Having been through a state government shutdown two summers ago, Chad Olson, lead electrician at an Air National Guard base in St. Paul, said he'd be inclined to look for a new job if he winds up on indefinite furlough again. "I can survive, but I don't want to put myself in a position where I can't survive," Olson said. ___ Associated Press writers Brian Bakst in St. Paul, Minn.; Andrew DeMillo in Little Rock, Ark.; David Eggert in Lansing, Mich.; Gary Fineout in Tallahassee, Fla.; John Hanna in Topeka, Kan.; and Brian Witte in Annapolis, Md., contributed to this report. ___ Follow David A.

According to the latest Credit Suisse Global Wealth Report, there are†98,700 "ultra high net worth" individuals in the world, defined as those with a net worth of over US$50 million. That number is up 14,200 from last year, and the report reasons that this shows that the world's economy is working out well for the ultra rich: While there is little reliable information on trends over time in the wealth pyramid data, it seems almost certain that wealth has been growing faster in the top strata of the wealth pyramid since at least the year 2000, and that this trend is continuing. For instance, total global wealth grew by 4.9% from mid-2012 to mid-2013, but the number of millionaires in the world grew by 6.1% during the same period, and the number of UHNW individuals rose by more than 10%. It therefore appears that the world economy remains conducive to the acquisition and preservation of large and medium sized fortunes. So where do this global elite ó very roughly the world's richest 0.001387015% ó live? Mostly in one country: Credit Suisse Correction: The percentage number was originally listed as 0.00001387015% due to a mathmatical error. It has since been corrected.
In a new report, Goldman Sachs economist George Cole says the planet is transitioning from the "Age of commodities" to the "Age of consumer durables," which will present new opportunities for global investors as this phase change materializes. The key is the rise of the middle class consumer in emerging markets (EM). "Over the coming decades the spending power of the EM middle class ñ the 'expanding middle' ñ will cause tectonic shifts in global consumption," says Cole. "The next set of structural opportunities in EMs will therefore depend on understanding not just the macro story of growth, but also the micro story of spending and consumption ñ in other words, understanding what the world wants." So, what does the world want? Goldman Sachs Global Investment ResearchClick to enlarge.Historical consumption patterns have the answer, says Cole: consumer durables, a category that includes everything from washing machines to sports cars (see chart at right). "These dynamics suggest that the EM story depends on more than simply headline growth," says Cole. "As EM incomes continue to rise in coming decades, the rate of demand growth for high-end consumer durables and services will continue to increase even after the peak of global potential GDP growth has passed." Thus, a shift from the "Age of commodities" to the "Age of consumer durables," as Cole explains in the report: The overall message is that we are passing from an 'Age of commodities' to an 'Age of consumer durables' ñ if commodities have seen the bulk of EM demand pressure over the previous decade, this is likely to shift to consumer durables in the next decade. For low-end consumer durables, a large part of this shift has occurred. For example, annual EM demand for cars is set to outstrip DMs in the next few years, driven by a three-fold increase in demand from China between the current and previous decade. For higher-end durables such as dishwashers and luxury cars the shift occurs later, with EM demand outpacing DMs by 2030. Growth in the demand for services remains high and consistent across each decade to 2050, and the EM share of services climbs higher each decade. This is in contrast to the EM shares of demand growth for commodities and low-end durables, which have largely peaked. "Across the regions, Asia, Latin America, CEEMEA and MENA all see major growth in consumer durables as they move through the current decade, and all hit the income range for peak services demand after 2030," says Cole. "Africa, with current income levels in the region of peak demand growth for commodities, has the most room to grow."
REUTERS/Jonathan ErnstThe cars of members of Congress, including one (L) belonging to a member of the Maryland delegation, fill the parking lot outside the House of Representatives during a Saturday session at the U.S. Capitol in Washington October 5, 2013. WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama pressured Republican lawmakers on Saturday to agree to raise the U.S. debt ceiling for longer than they would prefer, as their fiscal impasse dragged into the weekend with five days left to find a deal. The budget battle between Obama and Republicans who control the House of Representatives has idled hundreds of thousands of government workers hit by a 12-day government shutdown and put the United States at risk of a historic debt default, possibly by next Thursday, unless the borrowing limit is raised. With the potential of an economic calamity looming, Obama and his Republican opponents are trying to agree on how long to extend the debt ceiling, with Republicans wanting to limit the extension to six weeks to try force more concessions out of the president. Obama made clear in his weekly address Saturday that he wants a longer debt ceiling extension to get the U.S. economy through the holiday shopping season without a convulsive shock. Republicans want a commitment to broader deficit-reduction talks from the White House. "It wouldn't be wise, as some suggest, to kick the debt ceiling can down the road for a couple of months, and flirt with a first-ever intentional default right in the middle of the holiday shopping season," Obama said. While Obama's talks with House Republicans on Thursday and Senate Republicans on Friday were seen as a constructive sign of progress, there appears to be still a ways to go and many details to iron out before a deal can be clinched. North Dakota Republican Senator John Hoeven said there are enough ideas being discussed to get to an agreement, but the key now is finding the right combination of them that can pass both the House and Democratic-controlled Senate. "I do think it's going to take a few days here to get that right combination, but I'm hopeful we'll get a deal," Hoeven told Reuters. He said Republicans are willing to lift the debt ceiling and end the shutdown but want to make sure that government spending is cut - something they have been trying to negotiate with the White House for months without success. "I want to see the government get opened and I want to see a debt-ceiling solution. But we've got to use this time as well to find some savings and reforms, and we are talking about what savings and reforms we can get people to agree to," he said. Republicans have been knocked on their heels by polls showing Americans largely blame them for triggering the crisis, a political dynamic that has strengthened Obama's hand. The president has been unyielding in his insistence that he will not negotiate over the debt ceiling. Obama told Americans that his Republican opponents are manufacturing a crisis that has the potential for damaging the U.S. credit rating and causing global markets to go haywire. "Our government is closed for the first time in 17 years. A political party is risking default for the first time since the 1700s. This is not normal. That's why we have to put a stop to it," he said. House Republicans will meet at the Capitol on Saturday morning to discuss their options after sending the White House a proposal that included the short-term increase in the debt limit that would clear the way for re-opening the government. The House Republican proposal called for cuts in entitlement programs like the Medicare health plan for seniors to replace two years of the automatic spending cuts known as "sequestration" agreed to last year by Congress, senior congressional aides said. California Republican Representative Buck McKeon, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said in the Republican weekly address that his party is standing on some important principles. "It's about stemming the tide of debt and deficits that threatens to wash out an entire generation's opportunities," he said. (Editing by Philip Barbara)
Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has warned us that the U.S. would hit the debt ceiling on October 17 ó the date at which Treasury will cease to issue debt. However, many confuse this with the day the U.S. runs out of cash and the government defaults. Here is Goldman Sachs' Alec Phillips explained earlier this month: Since the Treasury usually aims to run a cash balance large enough to cover unexpected payment needs or a revenue shortfall, the Treasury expects to have $30bn on hand the day it exhausts its borrowing capacity. The Treasury views this $30bn as the minimum prudent balance in light of the significant uncertainty in daily cash flows, though there have been a few instances (unrelated to the debt limit) in which the cash balance has dipped below $15bn. Most external projections of the debt limit deadline focus on when this cash is depleted. Our own estimate implies that the Treasury could conceivably continue to make its scheduled payments until the end of October. However, the Treasuryís cash balance is likely to be so low after about October 25 that, depending on revenue fluctuations, the cash balance could be depleted on any day. At that point, it is possible that the Treasury would need to cease making payments in order to conserve the little remaining cash they would still have on hand. This isn't to say markets wouldn't react on October 17, but it does mean the politicians have a few days of extra wiggle room to strike a seemingly inevitable deal. Goldman Sachs
BloombergDavid Bianco.Deutsche Bank chief U.S. equity strategist David Bianco calls it a "high stakes week ahead" for the stock market. In a note to clients, Bianco says the S&amp;P 500 index is "likely to climb to 1725 or fall again to 1650" as the next stage of the battles in Washington over the budget and the debt ceiling transpires. The government shutdown resulting from inability in Congress to pass a 2014 budget has already deprived investors and policymakers of government-released economic data reports, so it's hard to get a good look at the latest economic picture at the moment. Over the next two weeks or so, however, we will see Q3 earnings results from almost all of America's biggest corporations as reporting season hits full swing. And there is concern that the surge in interest rates over the summer may finally start eating into profit margins. "The likelihood of a deal to lift the debt ceiling and end the shutdown before October 18th has increased, but only for a deal of limited scope and duration," says Bianco. "Such a deal is not the deal investors wished for and it will put the burden on 3Q earnings and macro data to push the S&amp;P to 1750 or higher by year-end." Bianco thinks the most likely scenario to play out in D.C. is a deal that puts off fiscal negotiations for another six months by Friday, October 18.
REUTERS/Yuriko NakaoHere they are: the most important charts in the world. We asked our favorite portfolio managers, strategists, analysts, and economists across the Street for the charts that they deem the most important right now, and this is what they sent us. A lot of the focus is on the stock market, as many consider it to be at a critical juncture. The withdrawal of Federal Reserve stimulus and attendant normalization of interest rates is also a hot topic ó as is the bloodbath in emerging markets ó while many are coming around to the notion that the American economy just can't grow like it used to anymore. But there are a lot of other things going on as well.
Dilbert, the well-known comic strip by cartoonist Scott Adams¬†about the office everyman and his crew of incompetent colleagues, was the first syndicated comic that focused primarily¬†on the workplace when it launched in 1989. Five years later, it had become so successful that Adams quit his corporate career to work on it full-time.¬†¬† It wasn't a straight line to success. Early versions of the comic were rejected by several publications, including The New Yorker and Playboy. It¬†wasn't until an editor at United Media saw it and recognized her own husband in the character that it finally got its¬†start, says¬†Adams¬†in his upcoming book ‚ÄúHow to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big.‚Äù¬† Ever since, the comic has explored topics like the inefficiency of meetings, the uselessness of management, and the absurdity of¬†office politics.¬† Exclusively for Business Insider,¬†Adams looked through the archives and shared¬†his 10 favorite Dilbert comics. Below, he explains why he chose¬†each and¬†counts them down to his absolute favorite of all-time. 10) Oct. 10, 2009: ‚ÄúDream job‚Äù¬†Courtesy of Scott Adams "This comic causes the reader to imagine a funny future in which Wally will only pretend to do the assignment. Humor sometimes works best when one suggests what is coming without showing it. People laugh harder when they need to use their imaginations to complete the joke.¬† "I also like comics in which characters are unusually happy about something trivial, evil, or selfish. That juxtaposition is always funny to me. "Another technique I often use involves characters saying things that should only be thought. That creates the inappropriateness that gives it an edge." ¬† 9) Sept. 24, 2009: ‚ÄúOpportunities‚Äù Courtesy of Scott Adams"Management-by-slogan usually comes across to employees as ridiculous and condescending. That, in part, is what makes the staff in this comic so uncaring about the boss‚Äôs house burning down. The ordinary evil of regular people is always funny to me. It‚Äôs easy to relate to it." ¬†¬† 8) Nov. 12, 2009: ‚ÄúRoll a donut in front of the cave‚Äù Courtesy of Scott Adams "A common humor technique involves juxtaposing something of immense importance with something trivial. The pairing of things that don‚Äôt belong together makes your brain ‚Äúsneeze‚Äù in the form of a laugh. In this comic, Wally is comparing his digestive system to Jesus rising from the dead. A dash of spiritual inappropriateness gives it some seasoning." ¬† 7) Dec. 3, 2009: ‚ÄúReusable presentation‚Äù Courtesy of Scott Adams"As I mentioned, I enjoy humor that highlights the selfish nature of people. We all relate to it. If you have a job, you probably spend some part of each day trying to disguise your selfish motives as win-win scenarios. And your attempts are probably as transparent as Wally‚Äôs.¬† "I also like jokes that involve inappropriate solutions to problems. This one has both. When you can layer two humor triggers in the same comic it almost always works." ¬† 6) Dec. 9, 2009: ‚ÄúCatching up to competition‚Äù Courtesy of Scott Adams"This one works because you never see the pointy-haired boss‚Äôs reaction, but you can imagine it vividly.¬† "Keeping true to the major theme of Dilbert, this comic highlights the uselessness of management. If you‚Äôve ever had a boss, this one probably hits home for you."  5) Jan. 7, 2010: ‚ÄúSynchronizing excuses‚Äù Courtesy of Scott Adams"I very much enjoy mocking common sayings. Often those little nuggets of wisdom make no sense whatsoever, but we‚Äôve heard them so often they feel as if they do. Good things¬†might¬†come to those who wait, but so does starvation. "This comic is also an example of what I call an 'engineered solution.' Wally has cleverly synchronized his excuses to the thunderstorm. I find cleverness to be funny when it is in the service of selfishness."  4) April 13, 2010: ‚ÄúAsok‚Äôs snout‚Äù Courtesy of Scott Adams"Here I‚Äôm juxtaposing an ordinary workplace lunch with the ridiculousness of Asok having a dog snout. Dilbert and Wally take it in stride. That‚Äôs the first humor level, but it wouldn‚Äôt be enough to make it work.¬† "The second level is that we all know people who value form over function while being oblivious to how others view them. When you shine a light on irrational human behavior it usually triggers a laugh reflex." ¬† 3) Sept. 27, 2010: ‚ÄúBrain golfing‚Äù Courtesy of Scott Adams"If you attend meetings, you probably spend a lot of time thinking your own thoughts while your coworkers drone on. This comic is funny to me because the boss is revealing his selfish thoughts, and also because 'brain golfing' is a funny combination of words. I figured most golfers could relate. I doubt I‚Äôm the only person who brain golfs." ¬† 2) Dec. 2, 2010: ‚ÄúOld Johannsen‚Äù Courtesy of Scott Adams"Wally is the worst employee of all time, but he‚Äôs likeable in his own way, so we enjoy seeing him get a win at the expense of the pointy-haired boss. And I think everyone who has a boss also dreams of becoming indispensable. It‚Äôs easy to relate to Wally‚Äôs glee in the third panel." ¬† 1) Nov. 9, 1993: ‚ÄúUnix programmers‚Äù¬†Courtesy of Scott Adams "This might be my all-time favorite Dilbert comic. When I was on the speaking circuit I always used it to end my talks to thunderous laughter. It‚Äôs naughty, clever, and it has a point of view. And it makes the reader imagine what happened before that moment shown in the comic and what might happen after. It‚Äôs rare to pack so many elements in one comic."
