Daniel Goodman / Business InsiderJan. 14 (Bloomberg) -- Chinaís unexpected surge in exports last month renewed concern from analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., UBS AG and Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. that statistics from the nation can be unreliable. The 14.1 percent jump from a year earlier was the biggest positive surprise since March 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The increase didnít match goods movements through ports and imports by trading partners according to UBS, while Goldman Sachs and Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd. cited a divergence from overseas orders in a manufacturing index. Smaller trade gains could signal a less robust recovery from a seven-quarter slowdown just as Australian Treasurer Wayne Swan says the economic rebound is a sign of improving global demand. Accurate statistics from the worldís second-biggest economy are increasingly important for domestic and foreign investors and for Chinaís government, ANZís Liu Li-Gang says. ìChinaís influence on the global economy has become bigger, so not only Chinese policy makers but also business people and the rest of the world need better data,î said Liu, Hong Kong- based chief economist for Greater China, who formerly worked for the World Bank. ìUnreliable data could have a negative impact on resource allocation and business planning.î The Beijing-based customs administration, which reported the December trade figures on Jan. 10, said it couldnít immediately respond to a faxed request from Bloomberg News for comment on the banksí skepticism. The Shanghai Composite Index, Chinaís benchmark stock gauge, rose 0.1 percent as of 10:01 a.m. local time. † † Chinaís economic growth may have recovered to 7.8 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, after sliding to a three-year low of 7.4 percent in the previous period, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey ahead of the data release on Jan. 18. Evidence that Chinaís economy ìappears to be stabilizingî is ìone cause of optimismî that global demand will improve this year, Swan said in his weekly economic note yesterday. China is Australiaís largest export market. The median forecast for Chinaís December exports in a Bloomberg survey of 40 economists was for a 5 percent gain, with the highest estimate at 9.2 percent, after Novemberís 2.9 percent growth. Goldman Sachs, ranked by Bloomberg as the most accurate forecaster for the indicator, projected a 7 percent rise. The increase, which was the biggest since May, could indicate exportersí rush to finish year-end orders and government pressure to report exports before the end of the year to reach the governmentís 2012 target of 10 percent growth, Shen Jianguang, Mizuhoís Hong Kong-based chief Asia economist, said in a Jan. 10 note. † † ìIt is possible that local governments may have tried to boost exports data by either making round trips in special trade zonesî or by exporting ìearlier than otherwise in an attempt to improve the annual exports data,î Goldman Sachsí Beijing- based economists Yu Song and Yin Zhang wrote the same day. Rushed shipments and even faked exports to secure tax refunds may have contributed to the stronger growth data, according to Alistair Thornton and Ren Xianfang, Beijing-based analysts at IHS Inc. UBS economists led by Hong Kong-based Wang Tao pointed to a ìquite obvious discrepancyî in the growth of Chinaís exports to Taiwan and South Korea and those economiesí reported imports from China in recent months, even as historically they have tracked each other well. † † A sub-index tracking new export orders as part of the governmentís manufacturing purchasing managersí index was at 50 in December, the dividing line between expansion and contraction and down from 50.2 in November. Elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region, a private gauge of Australian inflation advanced in December on costlier gasoline, travel and rent while home-loan approvals unexpectedly fell in November for the first time in four months. The Indian wholesale-price index probably climbed 7.37 percent in December from a year earlier, a Bloomberg survey showed. In Europe, a report may show euro-area industrial production fell in November from a year earlier for a 13th month, according to a Bloomberg survey. ANZís Liu and colleague Louis Lam published research last week that underscored doubts about the quality of Chinaís economic data. They found that quarterly GDP, industrial production, fixed-asset investment and inflation data published in percentage terms failed to conform to ìBenfordís Law,î which holds that in any series of numbers certain patterns will be found only if the statistics are naturally generated. † † Li Keqiang, who may succeed Wen Jiabao as premier in March, was quoted in 2007 as saying he watched figures on power, rail cargo and loans because gross domestic product numbers were ìman-made.î Liís remarks were in a U.S. diplomatic cable published by WikiLeaks in late 2010. After Chinaís statistics bureau reported third-quarter GDP in October, Standard Chartered Plc analysts said the 7.4 percent increase was ìtoo good to be trueî when compared with the slowdown in electricity production and the readings of a manufacturing index, while London-based Capital Economics Ltd. said its own analysis indicated expansion of about 6.5 percent. Some trading companies are turning to transportation providers like Shenzhen Global Express Logistics Ltd. for help in shipping goods through so-called bonded zones to claim export tax rebates or charge higher import prices for goods without them physically leaving the country. † † Shenzhen Global offers customs clearing and other freight services including a ìone-day tour,î Lin Yongtai, a manager with the company in the city bordering Hong Kong, said in a telephone interview. For a fee of 1,000 yuan ($161) per vehicle per day, the company will drive trucks into warehouses in bonded zones, where cargo must clear customs, so that businesses can obtain a refund of value-added tax on the ìexportî of their products or boost sale prices for goods that carry the cachet of being imported. ìA poor villager can boast he has thousands of yuan of turnover every day, but people later discover he only has one bull -- he takes the bull out every morning and brings it back every evening,î Lin said. ìThe same applies to some parts of Chinaís foreign trade.î Such practices arenít unknown to the customs administration. In March 2009 it issued a statement that ìsome local governments and enterprisesî were trying to move goods in and out of bonded zones to inflate their export and import numbers and said such shipments would not be included in official data. † --Nerys Avery, Zhou Xin.

It's very difficult to contemplate the market reaction of a US default (which we mean strictly as missing an interest payment on US debt) in part because A) no entity anywhere near the significance of the US has defaulted before and B) a default theoretically would hurt US Treasuries, which are typically what people buy in a state of panic. For those not familiar with this pattern, here's a chart of the VIX (volatility, blue line) and the inverse of US borrowing costs (red line). When volatility surges (as frequently happens in a panic) people buy Treasuries like crazy.  It seems safe to assume that a default would cause a major crash of risk assets (stocks, etc.), but what about Treasuries? The presumption is that a default causes a spike in rates, but that assumption is due in part due to thinking of the US as a normal 'credit' (for most entities a default would be associated with a rate spike). But a rate spike in a panic would be exceedingly abnormal. SocGen's Kit Juckes aptly put it in a tweet. @jamesgrickards @thestalwart hmm... risk aversion with higher Tsy yields will, I suppose, be the 9th circle of debt super-cycle hell.... Of course we really don't know what would happen. It would be unprecedented in modern finance.
The week begins, and things are very slow. There was very little big news over the weekend, and Japan is closed. The only "action" is Australia, which is up 0.1% at the moment. 
flickr / ShardayyyCiti currency guru Steven Englander has a new note out this evening titled: No coin + temporary debt ceiling extension + sequester = US Dollar negative. In it he notes that the rejection of the trillion dollar coin idea to avert the debt ceiling is not alone a market moving event, but that the hard language taken by the White House that the choices boil down to clean lift or default raises the odds of a debt ceiling breach. His take: So it is possible that we will get a technical default for a few days, but more likely that Congress will give in, vote the debt ceiling up temporarily, and let the automatic sequesters kick in. Mounting risk of a technical default was USD positive in 2011 because it led to cutting of long-risk positions and the USD/Treasury market remained safe havens.† However, it also occurred in an environment of slowing EM growth and intensifying euro zone sovereign risk pressure, so the USD support came from external forces as well. Given that investors are now somewhat long risk again, the position cutting is again likely to be USD positive, however, unattractive US assets were. As was the case in 2011, it is very unlikely that the Treasury will not pay its bills, although even a technical default could have very unforeseen consequences, given the multiple functions that Treasuries play in global financial markets. The more likely scenario of sequester plus grudging debt ceiling rise is USD negative. It will put more pressure on the Fed to keep pumping liquidity into the US economy without giving any reassurance to investors that long-term fiscal issues are close to resolution. That seems reasonable. A debt ceiling hike + a full sequester, which would equal a weaker economy and more pumping. With Europe healing and China rebounding, USD would be the big loser.
Library of CongressBy now you've probably heard the Treasury say they will not be minting a $1 trillion coin to help the U.S. avoid the debt ceiling. But the federal government exploiting obscure loopholes under moments of extreme duress is not without precedent. At the beginning of 1895, the country was facing default after its gold reserves evaporated. But through some legal archaeology¬†JP Morgan located an obscure, Civil War-era statute that would allow he and some fellow international financiers to replenish the Treasury's gold stocks. The country was saved. With the help of Bancroft Prize-winner Jean Strouse's biography "Morgan,"¬†we retell the story. (Thanks to John Steele Gordon for helping us track down the anecdote).
I didn't know anything about Aaron Swartz until he killed himself two days ago. Since then, thanks to the outpouring of emotion over his death, I've learned a lot. I've learned enough to know that Swartz's death is a big loss not just to those who knew him and loved him but to the community at large. The number of amazing things that Swartz was involved in during his short lifeóRSS, Reddit, campaigns against the Internet censorship bills SOPA and PIPA, et alósuggests that he might have gone on to do much, much more. I've also learned enough to know that some serious questions need to be answered about the legal situation that Swartz was involved in. After his death, Swartz's family and friends said the behavior of the U.S. Attorney, who was prosecuting Swartz for an alleged criminal hacking incident, contributed to his suicide. That's a serious charge, one that would weigh heavily on the conscience of any fair person involved in the prosecution. So for the sake of both sides, it needs to be investigated. (To be fair, there's no way that the prosecutors bear the full responsibility here, no matter how they behaved. Life isn't fair, and Swartz was quite open about his struggles with depression.) Lawrence Lessig, the noted Harvard professor and legal scholar, concurs with Swartz's family, saying that Swartz was a victim of prosecutorial "bullying," in which a prosecutor was taking what appears to have been a relatively minor transgression and using it to brand Swartz as a "criminal felon" and force him to plead guilty to multiple felonies. Other writers, such as Jonathan Blanks, have already cited the case as another instance of prosecutorial overreach and described the reality that prosecutors are endowed with an extraordinary amount of power but are not incented to use that power to be fair and reasonable. Rather, they are incented to prosecute those whom they, in their sole discretion, regard as criminalsóand get convictions. And this incentive system leads some prosecutors to overreachóbring cases they shouldn't, or use their power too harshlyówithout having enough respect for the lives of those they prosecute. After reading these essays, I read the prosecutor's indictment of Swartz. In 2011, Swartz was charged with multiple felonies after downloading millions of academic papers from the online repository JSTORóa service that aggregates these papers and makes them available for a modest fee to institutions and individuals. Based on the prosecutors' description of this incidentóa description that has not yet been established as factóthere's no question that Swartz did something unethical and, probably, illegal.† He accessed a network he was not entitled to access, hid his real identity, changed his digital identity multiple times once his actions were discovered and blocked, and knew he was doing something wrong.† But there's a far cry between "unethical" and "13 felonies" punishable by a long prison sentence, especially when the items that Swartz downloaded were mostly freely available academic papers. This is where prosecutorial discretion comes in. And that's where we enter a part of our legal process that is often unfamiliar to those who haven't had firsthand experience with it. Our legal system is a so-called "adversarial system." It pits one side, prosecutors, against the other side, defendants. If a case goes to trial, each side has an opportunity to make its case. And then a neutral party, a judge or jury, decides who is right. Our legal system is a good system. If you haven't taken a moment to appreciate the fact that, in America, you 1) have the right to "have your day in court" and 2) your day in court has a reasonable chance of being a relatively fair hearing, you should do so now. People in many countries do not have these things. And the amount of injustice that is dispensed in these countries would make any fair person cringe. But just because our system is good doesn't mean it is perfect. Our system does not always "get it right." (No system does.)† And our system can be unfair in ways that are not always obvious to those who haven't been through the process. When a prosecutor decides to charge someone with a crime, the prosecutor immediately puts that person's normal life on hold. The prosecutor also forces the person to either 1) cut a deal, or 2) defend him or herself in court. If you are guilty of the prosecutors' charges, this decision is easy: You plead guilty and cut a deal. If you are not guilty, however, or guilty of much less serious infractions, you find yourself in an extraordinarily stressful and, to some extent, no-win situation. Defending yourself in court is an extremely stressful, expensive, time-consuming, and risky proposition. Unless you choose to use a public defender, even small trials can cost astronomical amounts of money and take years to prepare for. (Lawrence Lessig tossed off the remark that Swartz's trial would be a "million-dollar" trial that had already depleted Swartz's modest wealth.)† Even if you win, you don't get your money, time, or reputation back. So it will be a Pyrrhic victory, regardless. If you defend yourself and lose, meanwhile, your sentence is likely to be far more punitive than it would have been if you had just "taken responsibility for your actions" and cut a deal. For obvious reasons, judges and prosecutors look favorably on defendants who save the government money and time by not defending themselves. And these folks usually get a better deal. All of this is logical.† And if a fair-minded prosecutor who is completely convinced of a defendant's guilt brings fair charges and offers a reasonable deal prior to trial, then the system is working as it should. The trouble comes when the prosecutor is not fair-minded. Or not certain of a defendant's guilt. Or does not bring fair charges. Or does not offer a reasonable deal. In these cases, a defendant faces an even tougher choice: OR The reality of our justice system, in other words, is that prosecutors don't just have the power to act as "adversaries." To a certain extent, by being able to bring major pressure to try to force a plea deal, they also have the power to act as judge and jury. In Aaron Swartz's case, the U.S. Attorney had charged Swartz with 13 criminal felonies, including wire fraud,and the usual kitchen-sink crimes that seem to get tossed into any computer-related case. If Swartz were to have been convicted of even some of these felonies, he would likely have faced many years in prison. So his downside risk was huge. If Swartz had considered himself to have committed these 13 felonies, he would likely have pleaded guilty and cut a deal. So it seems safe to assume that Swartz did not believe he was guilty of 13 felonies. And it also seems safe to assume that he was not offered a plea deal that he could live withóeither because the prosecutor was demanding that he plead guilty to crimes he didn't think he had committed and/or because the prosecutor was offering a sentence that Swartz thought was too harsh. So the key questions that need to be answered are these: Or, as Lessig and others suggest, was this a case in which a prosecutor decided to make an example of Swartz in hopes of claiming a high-profile scalp and furthering his own career? (It would also be helpful to know what Swartz's motivations were in downloading the academic papers. He wasn't going to make a personal financial gain, clearly, so the action appears to have been motivated by an idealistic view that "information should be free and freely available" or some other philosophy that is common in some parts of the tech community, especially among younger people.) Regardless of the answers to these questions, Aaron Swartz's death is a tragedy, and nothing that happens in the future will change that. And no matter how he was treated by prosecutors, there is no way that they deserve all of the blame for what happened. (Life isn't fair, and many people have survived far greater unfairness and injustice than thisóif that's indeed what happened here.) But especially because Swartz is no longer here to defend himself, and because the U.S. Attorney is being partially blamed for his death, we need to get the answers to these questions. We owe both sides that. SEE ALSO: 26-Year Old Reddit Co-Founder Aaron Swartz Has Died

A surprising number of people in China have been writing and talking about ‚Äúrevolution‚Äù.¬† First came word, in November, that China‚Äôs new leaders have been advising their colleagues to read Alexis de Tocqueville‚Äôs classic book on the French Revolution, L‚ÄôAncien R√©gime et la R√©volution (The Old Regime and the Revolution), which subsequently has shot to the top of China‚Äôs best seller lists.¬† Just this past week, Chinese scholar Zhao Dinxing, a sociology professor at the University of Chicago, felt the need to publish an article (in Chinese) laying out the reasons China won‚Äôt have a revolution (you can read an English summary here).¬† Minxin Pei, on the other hand, thinks it will. In the midst of this debate, I happened across an interesting set of passages in retired Harvard professor Richard Pipes‚Äô slender volume Three ‚ÄúWhys‚Äù of the Russian Revolution.¬† The first ‚Äúwhy‚Äù he asks is ‚ÄúWhy did Tsarism fall?‚Äù, an event that few saw coming: If you read the Russian and foreign press before 1917, or memoirs of the time, you find that hardly anyone expected the downfall of tsarism either.¬† On the contrary, people believed that tsarism would survive for a long time to come ‚Ä¶ For had not tsarism weathered all onslaughts and all crises [including the 1905 uprising], and emerged from them intact? The answer, he argues, lies in the fact that Russian society changed dramatically, but its political system did not, leading to an explosive disconnect between the two: So, around 1900, we have a mechanically rather than organically structured state that denies the population any voice in government, and yet, at the same time, aspires to the status of a global power.¬† This aspiration compels it to promote industrial development and higher education, which has the inevitable effect of shifting much opinion and the power to make decisions to private citizens.¬† Pre-1905 tsarism thus suffered from an irreconcilable contradiction.¬† A not-insignificant segment of the population received secondary and higher education, acquiring, in the process, Western attitudes, and yet it was treated as being on the same level with the illiterate peasantry, that is, unfit to participate in the affairs of state.¬† Capitalist industrialists and bankers made major decisions affecting the country‚Äôs economy and employment, yet had no say in that country‚Äôs politics because politics was the monopoly of the bureaucracy ‚Ä¶ The result was a situation which Marx had rightly predicted had to arise when the political form ‚Äî in this case, heavily centralized and static ‚Äî no longer corresponded to the socio-economic context ‚Äî increasingly dispersed and dynamic.¬† Such a situation is by its very nature fraught with explosive potential.¬† In 1982 [Pipes writes], when I worked in the National Security Council, I was asked to contribute ideas to a major speech that President Reagan was scheduled to deliver in London.¬† My contribution consisted of a reference to Marx‚Äôs dictum that, when there develops a significant disparity between the political form and the socio-economic context, the prospect is revolution.¬† This disparity, however, had now developed in the Soviet Union, not in the capitalist West.¬† President Reagan inserted this thought into his speech, and the reaction in Moscow was one of uncontrolled fury: this, of course, was a language they well understood and interpreted to mean a declaration of political war against the Communist Bloc.¬† Their anger was enhanced by the awareness that the statement was correct, that they were ruling in a manner that did not correspond to either the economic or the cultural level of their population. Read that again carefully, line by line, with present-day China in mind, and I think you‚Äôll¬† find some fascinating food for thought.¬† I have often observed that I know of no country that has changed as much in the past 30 years as China has, in terms of the kind of practical freedom people experience in their day-to-day lives.¬† The greatest challenge facing China‚Äôs leaders is how ‚Äî or whether ‚Äî a fundamentally closed political system (rule by an elite) can cope with the dramatically more open economy and society that present-day China has become.¬† That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre reading Tocqueville.
The fiscal cliff has taken top billing in the "main risks" sections of investment forecasts and economic outlooks for the past several months as markets awaited the December 31 showdown over spending cuts and tax hikes feared to put a serious drag on the economy. Concurrently, since the ECB's announcement of an OMT bond market intervention plan to combat rising borrowing costs this summer, unsustainably high interest rates have been fixed on a steady downward trajectory in Europe, and the euro crisis has captured less and less attention. Politicians averted the fiscal cliff by making a deal to postpone it, but there are still three big fiscal battles taking place over the coming weeks and months: there is, of course, the debt ceiling, there are the automatic spending cuts in the sequester postponed by the cliff deal, and then there is the expiry of the "continuing resolution," which would lead to a government shutdown if not renewed. However, investors are once again ‚Äì for the first time since early last summer ‚Äì¬†citing¬†Europe¬†as the biggest risk to financial markets, according to a BofA investor survey of¬†86 global fixed income fund managers conducted between January 4 and January 9. Specifically, deterioration in the fundamentals of the European economy now poses the biggest threat: BofA Merrill Lynch Concerns stemming from the fiscal cliff remain high at 31 percent, but they have come down in January as the European story has returned to investors' minds. Investors may feel more comfortable with the U.S. fiscal situation due to recent trends in the economic data, according to the survey: BofA Merrill Lynch As ECB President Mario Draghi recently noted, financial conditions in the eurozone are on the mend, but much of the economy is not. Further complicating matters are that policymakers already have too high of expectations for economic growth, forcing them to continually revise their projections downward. Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid devoted a large portion of his 2013 outlook to the topic of eurozone economic fundamentals. This excerpt sums up the concerns pretty well: In 2012 the ECB prevented a financial meltdown by announcing its intention to buy short-dated bonds for countries in need via the OMT program. This is a huge step from the ECB¬†but it remains a liquidity facility and not a solution to any solvency concerns that there may be in the future.¬†For it to work successfully over the medium-term it needs to be proved that growth can stabilize in the most vulnerable countries and then show signs of picking up. If we see some indication of this in 2013 then the European Sovereign crisis will continue to be on hold. However our fear is that if economists again under-estimate the negative growth consequences of this crisis and indeed austerity in the most vulnerable countries,¬†then it‚Äôs possible we can have solvency concerns reasserting themselves even though a liquidity program is operational. We noted a month ago that things have really changed when a European bank analyst is mostly worried about the U.S. economy¬†‚Äì¬†but perhaps things haven't changed so much, after all.

AP ImagesWho killed the trillion dollar coin? According to Zeke Miller at Buzzfeed, talking to a Senior White House source, it was the Fed. But it was the Federal Reserve that killed the proposal, the official told BuzzFeed, denying a purely political rationale for the announcement, saying the independent central bank would not have credited the Treasury's accounts for the vast sum for depositing the coin. There are two interesting things about this. One is that it seems odd that the Fed would decide that there's some legal tender that it will recognize, and some legal tender that it wouldn't recognize. Furthermore, by placing the blame on the Fed, it would seem that the White House/Treasury wanted to keep this idea available as a last-second escape valve in case things were about to get that bad. Now this option sounds foreclosed to them. Read Zeke's full report here &gt;
APAfter a week during which his organization met with Vice President Joe Biden to talk proposals to curb the nation's rash of gun violence, NRA President David Keene predicted Sunday that two of the White House's big proposals would fail in Congress. Speaking on CNN's "State of the Union" with Candy Crowley, Keene said that both the assault weapons ban and a curb on high capacity magazines wouldn't hold up in Congress. "I would say that the likelihood is that they are not going to be able to get an assault weapons ban through this Congress," Keene said. "The fact is that we live in a society where first of all, we have constitutional rights, and secondly, there are millions upon millions of Americans who value the rights that they have under the Second Amendment." And a limit on certain high-capacity magazines wouldn't hold up, he suggested, because they are too cheap to be effectively regulated. "Even David Gregory could find one," Keene quipped, referring to when the "Meet the Press" host held up a high-capacity magazine during NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre's appearance on the show last month. On Friday, the†White House brushed back on suggestions that it would not pursue a reinstatement of the assault weapons ban†as part of its overall strategy to curb gun violence. White House spokesman Matt Lehrich called reports that President Barack Obama wouldn't look for reinstatement false, saying because it would be "politically difficult" wasn't a concern. Later on "State of the Union," Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin agreed that an assault weapons ban couldn't pass as a standalone bill. Manchin, a Democrat in the deep red state of West Virginia, was one of the most prominent members of Congress to signal a change in his thinking on gun control after the elementary school massacre in Newtown, Conn.  But Manchin said a reinstatement of the assault weapons ban that expired in 2004 would have to be combined with other measures to get through Congress.†
Getty Images/Jamie SquireThe cyclist Lance Armstrong could lose much more than his already ravaged reputation if he confesses to doping this week during a television interview with Oprah Winfrey -- he could end up in jail. The disgraced Texan's decision to talk to the famed US talk show host has divided opinion, as some say he needs to do something radical to rehabilitate his public profile, while others say speaking out will only make matters worse. The crux of the matter is whether Armstrong, having been stripped of his seven Tour de France titles, will finally admit that he was a drugs cheat. Such a confession would overturn more than a decade of strenuous denials. "If I were his lawyer, I'd be telling him not to do it. I think he's crazy," said Peter Keane, law professor at Golden Gate University in San Francisco, of the cyclist's decision to give the interview, which will be aired Thursday. "He's in considerable jeopardy of some sort of criminal prosecution... for which he could go to prison," Keane said. The threats to Armstrong's liberty stem from the fallen icon's role in the US Postal Service team, where he spent his most successful years in the saddle. Having been paid by the government, the former team leader could face criminal charges for making fraudulent statements to his bosses. He could also be accused of perjury over disclosures made under oath to a US federal jury in 2005. If convicted, each false statement could lead to five years in jail. Armstrong has always maintained that he did not use banned substances during his stellar career, but in August last year he chose not to contest charges put forward by the US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) that he was a serial drugs cheat. The pitfalls of speaking to Winfrey, considered the favored TV forum for "tell all" confessional style interviews, appear to have been weighed, and a decision taken that it is worthwhile to reveal something new. "I'm anticipating a major announcement," said Jordan Kobritz, chair of the State University of New York at Cortland's International Sport Management graduate program, noting that Armstrong would otherwise have no reason to talk. "You don't have to go on Oprah to do what he's been doing in his entire athletic life, and that is deny, deny and deny that he ever engaged in illegal drugs," Kobritz said, agreeing with Keane that perjury and criminal charges are possible. One possibility is that justice officials in California will re-open a file they closed last year concerning alleged drug use and misuse of funds when Armstrong was with the US Postal Service team. Another case that could come back to haunt the cyclist is an arbitration hearing in Dallas in 2005 where he said under oath that he had never taken banned substances, a statement which raises the specter of perjury charges. But Armstrong's profile, albeit diminished, as a cancer survivor who raised awareness and hundreds of millions of dollars to fight the disease, is likely the chip that could spare him the worst possible outcome. "Regardless of whether he comes out and makes a flat admission, I guarantee there will still be a majority of US citizens who will say 'I don't care what he did, he's still my hero,'" Kobritz said, citing Armstrong's cancer survival. "Unless there's a prosecutor who wants to stake his reputation and his future political career," on putting Armstrong in the dock, "I suspect they're going to leave him alone," Kobritz added. But Michael McCann, director of the sports law institute at Vermont Law School, said there could be an upside to speaking out, if not immediately then in the mid-term, even if that means going to jail beforehand for perjury. "It wouldn't be five years, but it could be six months, any amount of time would be pretty bad," he said. But there could be "a sense of coming clean, having a cleaner conscience... public forgiveness, and relief maybe," added McCann, who is soon to head up a new sports and entertainment law institute at the University of New Hampshire.

By EconMatters 3-Month Depreciating Yen TradeThe 3 month Japanese Yen trade which every fund manager from San Diego to Hong Kong has taken part in will sure help Japanese exporters and help spur more economic activity in what has been a real laggard in both business competitiveness, and the race to weaken their currency that has occurred during the last five years.EconMattersHowever, there are very few free lunches in the world, and I imagine there will be some costs or unintended consequences of this newfound commitment towards a weaker Yen. Almost every currency has appreciated against the Yen the past 3 months, and the original target was placed at 90 for the USD/JPY cross, now analysts are targeting 100 for the cross. On October 1st¬†the JPY/CNY cross was 0.0806 and today the currency cross is 0.0697 for a pretty significant move against a currency who doesn`t like to strengthen against anybody if they can help it. China has made an art out of currency manipulation, and built an entire competitive advantage on having an undervalued currency. EconMatters Inflation is Back!On Friday, China reported that inflation jumped to a six month high in December rising from 2% in November to 2.5% for consumer prices in December, the highest reading since June of 2012. The rise in consumer prices was attributed to the colder winter which reflected smaller crops and higher vegetable prices. Well, a strengthening Yuan cannot be good for inflation as it just attracts more hot money into the country, and this sure cannot bode well for those hoping for additional stimulus measures coming out of China to spur economic growth in an economy that has struggled the past two years with higher inflation and lower trending growth. There will be a lag before some of the effects of this substantial currency move by the Japanese Yen gets pushed through the Chinese economy and all of Asia for that matter, but it bears watching if the pattern of a depreciating Yen continues.

This trade had a nice run, but really came apart towards the end of 2012, it was equally crowded with everyone from Hedge Funds to your local Greek cab driver, and if you polled most participants at the time, they all thought the end game for that trade was much higher in terms of Gold priced in Euros. Well, the Euro strengthened considerably and Gold failed to take out previous resistance in terms of the Dollar, and the entire trade rolled over, forcing Gold to be sold into as the year ended with the entire trade falling apart rather aggressively. EconMatters The Rebirth of the Carry TradeSo the Japanese Yen has weakened to such a degree in so short of a time and has brought back many carry trades, which has helped fuel the rise in both equities and oil. However, things have been pretty smooth sailing with the end of year run-up, and money freely flowing into the New Year. Let`s see how that trade holds up with the first spike in volatility which is undoubtedly going to rear its ugly head sooner rather than later. Let`s see how many traders run for the exits the first 4-day earning`s related selloff or Debt Ceiling Standoff that tests ratings agencies patience. This is the true sign of whether the trend is more than a Hedge Fund fad, or has real legs that can be sustainable for two to three years, long enough to bring back one of the greatest of all carry trades in the history of modern day financial markets the Yen Carry Trade. The Euro/Gold Trade turned out to be unsustainable, a mere fad in trader lexicon. It remains to be seen how sustainable the recent enthusiasm for the Weak Yen Trade is for the long term.¬© EconMatters All Rights Reserved | Facebook | Twitter | Post Alert | Kindle     Read more posts on EconMatters ¬ª
