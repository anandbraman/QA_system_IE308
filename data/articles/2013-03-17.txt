CNBCAdam ParkerAdam Parker, Morgan Stanley's top U.S. equity strategist, has been on the more bearish end of Wall Street when it comes to forecasting what stocks will do. In November, he issued a 1,434 year-end target for the S&amp;P 500. But with the S&amp;P 500 surging to 1,560, just 5 points from its all-time high, Parker has finally felt compelled to revise that number. In a research note published on Sunday, he raised his target to 1,600. "Much of the market’s recent gains have come from multiple expansion rather than higher earnings expectations," he wrote.  "In this update we are modestly raising our S&amp;P 500 2013 EPS forecast from $99 to $103, marking to market the higher-than-expected 2012 year-end results." More on why multiples have expanded: Why has the P/E expanded? Most likely, this reflects central banks’ aggressive liquidity injections, which have translated into an increasing conviction among investors that major tail risks have been indefinitely removed. The growing reality that there are limited investment opportunities outside of equities has fueled stronger inflows into equity markets in some regions and driven expectations of an even more substantial rotation. While these factors may drive a further moderate increase in valuations, our guess is that the majority of the re-rating is now behind us, absent a more material improvement in the economic landscape than we currently forecast.  Our assumptions for the price-to-earnings ratios of most markets are unchanged or lower (in the case of Japan) except for the US, where we are increasing the projected multiples in our base, bull, and bear cases by approximately 1.5 turn... Parker was 2011's most accurate market forecaster.  However, he was way off in 2012 when he said the S&amp;P 500 would end the year at 1,167. (It actually went to 1,426). Back then he blamed his inaccuracy on getting the market multiple wrong. "Only the hubristic deign to project the market multiple — and those who "accidentally" get it right for a year, like us in 2011, and potentially develop exaggerated confidence — as evidently we did this year in projecting another year of multiple contraction," wrote Parker last year when he realized his 2012 call was likely doomed. Once again, it looks like his multiple assumption was far too bearish.
Kyprou, 62, born in Larnaca, had worked most of his life as a chauffeur and driver in England, proudly buying his London council flat and scrimping to put aside money in Cyprus for when he returned for holidays and eventually to retire. "I'd put aside Â£50 here, Â£20 there, all my life," he said. Over decades, he had built up around â‚¬6,000 (Â£5,200) in a Larnaca account. "It was a state building society; I assumed it was safe." But now, as depositors holding less than â‚¬100,000 are made to pay 6.75% and those with more than â‚¬100,000 9.9% as part of a â‚¬10bn (Â£8.7bn) bailout agreed in Brussels, Kyprou stands to lose â‚¬400 overnight. "That's a lot for someone like me," he said. When he heard the news on Saturday morning, he rushed to the cashpoint and queued with others who were panicking and trying to take out as much money as they could. The media reported a run on ATMs that were depleted by mid-afternoon. But with Cyprus taking immediate steps to prevent any money transfers over the weekend, ordinary savers realised there was little they could do to lessen the blow. On Sunday the parliament of Cyprus postponed a crucial debate and vote on the move until Monday, without giving a reason. Banks will remain closed for several days because of the holiday. In Larnaca, the third largest city on the tiny eastern Mediterranean island, the queues at cashpoints had shrunk by Sunday night but the mood was one of shock, anger and injustice. Only three weeks ago, Cyprus voted in elections where, for once, the island's defining issue of its 40-year-old division into the Greek-speaking south and the Turkish north was overtaken by more urgent worries. The country of 1.1 million people had been ravaged by its worst economic crisis since the 1970s, with unemployment at a record high of 15% and fears of meltdown in a bloated banking sector which was more than eight times the size of the nation's economy. The Conservative winner Nicos Anastasiades promised at least that savers' deposits were safe. This weekend he accepted bailout terms that turned that promise on its head. Stelios Zinga, a truck driver in his late 50s, had joined the cashpoint queues. "People are panicking, they're afraid of losing their money, they don't feel they can trust banks anymore," he said. "The problem with this levy is that it is the cautious, working-class people who are being made to pay." His work as a driver had already suffered from the economic downturn, and he now felt it would plummet. The classic Cypriot education ethic, where hard-saving parents supported their children studying abroad, would feel the strain, he said. "My son is studying chemical engineering in Edinburgh. I'm worried I won't be able to get money to him." Christiana Konteati, 26, a lawyer, who finished a degree in London three years ago, said: "We're really worried that this is only the beginning: next will come salary cuts, austerity, rising unemployment and very likely people going abroad to work." She said the younger generation didn't have savings to fear for but a large part of her graduate friends were unemployed including a translator, a marketing graduate, a physicist and an accountant. One flabbergasted Larnaca bank employee, 28, was grabbing a coffee before returning to the rolling TV news he said the nation was glued to. He found the bank levy an "extraordinary" surprise. "Are we the guinea pigs? There's a feeling they are trying this out on us before they do it elsewhere. Let's see how the markets react." Further along the promenade, some bristled at the charge in Europe that Cyprus, flush with Russian cash, was a conduit for money-laundering and that the European decision-makers felt the rich Russian depositors should be made to pay. More than 25% of bank deposits and about one-third of foreign investments in Cyprus come from Russia. So many Russians now live in the port city of Limassol that it has been dubbed "Limassolgrad". "We need foreign investment and it could now shrink," said one student, arguing that most savers in Cyprus were Cypriots. Many felt resentment at the EU and its financial decision-makers would grow. Others wondered whether a better solution to the nation's financial woes was the recent discovery of gas deposits that amounted to more gas than Cyprus could use in over a century, and which it hopes to begin exporting by 2018, potentially meeting a major part of the EU's annual demand. As always, the emotional resonance from the island's bloody division 40 years ago, was never far from the surface. One retired teacher who had to flee her village in the north in 1974, said: "They're taking money, but at least now I have a home and clothes to change into. Back then, we had nothing. Cyprus will come through this somehow."  This article originally appeared on guardian.co.uk 
Jeremy Grantham, the brilliant head of investment firm GMO, appeared on Charlie Rose last week. Grantham maintained his usual grim tone. But Rose challenged him. "How many have stepped forward to say doom, doom, doom, and doom, whether it`s the economy, whether it`s the planet, whether it`s â€” and all of a sudden you realize that it wasn`t quite that bad, that something came along to avoid the results?" asked Rose. Grantham reminded Rose that history's greatest civilizations always "developed a kind of chutzpah, an arrogance in the belief of what they can do." "And they overreach, the weather turns against them, et cetera, et cetera, and they collapse," he said. "Not one or two, every civilization collapsed. And now we have a global civilization." Grantham has long warned of scarce food supplies, climate change, and economic growth rates that he believes are destined to decelerate. But, during the interview with Rose, he clarified that doom doesn't have to be a sure thing. "However, I am an optimist in two ways," he said seemingly out of nowhere.Â  "We have two gifts that none of those hundreds of failed civilizations had, that might â€” it`s quite undeserved, incidentally, it`s pure luck â€” might get us off the hook." "One of them is the fertility rate," he said. "Malthus never dreamt for a second that as people got richer they would volunteer to have fewer children. Back in those days if you were rich you had 20 children, 15 children. And now you have 1.5. And we have made enormous progress. My favorite being Iran, a Muslim society.Â  In 1960, seven children per woman. And now it`s 1.5, 1.6." He acknowledged that some emerging markets are facing labor issues due to insufficient population growth. However, he thinks those are just short-term problems. "In the long-term you have got to get the global population down," he said. "We have more population than we can sustain without carbon-based fuel." "The second good reason," he continued "is alternative energy." "Every wave of technology has been â€” has required a wave of energy. Here we have a wave of technology that does exactly the reverse. It suppresses the demand on our finite resources of coal and oil. Every time you have a brilliant new idea, an IPO, capitalism at its best, developing an energy-saving technique, solar, wind power, storage, a grid, a new state of the art grid system, all of those suppress the need to use our finite resources. And that is wonderful. And that is happening faster than people realize." Those are two pretty big gifts. Watch the whole interview at CharlieRose.com.

The weird thing about finance: A bailout deal that will save Germany a few billion in taxpayer dollars (by shifting the burden to Cypriot depositors) is wiping exponentially more than that off the world's market indices today. CNBC's Deirdre Wang Morris tweets a photo of the CNBC Asia market wall, which is as good a way as any to see the carnage. Deirdre Wang Morris
Cyprus the Nation and the Cypriot Banking System were insolvent.Â  It was a mess.Â  The system (they are intertwined) relied on ELA (Emerging Lending Agreements?) from the ECB.Â  That is how they were being financed. They paid high rates on deposits.Â  Depositors assumed they had insurance for up to at least the â‚¬100,000 of guarantees, though it looks like it was guaranteed by the government, so a circular non-functional system. One way or the other, without some real wealth transfer, losses were going to have to be taken. What people didnâ€™t expect was for all depositors to be hit.Â  The original plan was to levy a tax of 6.75% on deposits below â‚¬100,000 and 9.9% on those above.Â  There are already talks about changing that plan. There are two mitigating circumstances that can contain this situation. Cyprus is small.Â  It really doesnâ€™t represent a meaningful portion of EU economic activity.Â  If Greece never felt â€œEuropeanâ€ to many, Cyprus seems even more disconnected. People were going to lose money one way or the other.Â  If you donâ€™t like the way it was handled, that is a problem, but without a direct wealth transfer, someone had to take losses.Â  Default could have been messier, and in the end, the decision to create an arbitrary number to hit depositors with may be unfair, but it might be better than they would have had otherwise. That will be the spin on the positive side.Â  I donâ€™t find either particularly compelling but they are mitigating circumstances. Before going into the great ramifications of what happened, it is useful to highlight the difference between the U.S. and Europe.Â Â In the U.S., we came up with $60 billion of taxpayer money to help victims of Hurricane Sandy.Â  We didnâ€™t question the need to build in areas near the water.Â  The desire to keep trees over power lines to make things more beautiful.Â  Heck, we were busy spending this money while facing a fiscal cliff and staring sequester in the face.Â  The EU could have cut a check for â‚¬5 billion or so here and avoided this.Â  They probably could cut a check for $60 billion and solve a lot of problems.Â  But that is not how Europe thinks.Â  For all the talk about keeping it together, there is more concern about self-preservation at each country than there is about unity. For all the talk about â€œbailoutsâ€, the nations that have â€œbackstoppedâ€ the other countries have all made money.Â  The ECB has been paid in full on every loan they made and every bond they bought.Â  They have received every interest payment due.Â  Ditto for the EFSF.Â  So donâ€™t get too excited about the â€œsacrificesâ€ Germany has been making. Germany has made a lot of money from lending and backstopping lending to the various countries that were â€œbailed outâ€ and demand many changes to those countries.Â  We gave $60 billion for hurricane relief and encouraged people to recreate rather than change.Â  There is a real risk, that the resolve of the ECB will once again be tested. Going after deposits might make economic sense, but it is dangerous.Â Â We have a Fed and the FDIC to discourage runs on banks.Â  At some level, we have decided that having a run on a bank is a bad idea.Â  When our crisis hit, the FDIC didnâ€™t complain that it was short funding (which it was).Â Â The FDIC, instead increased the amounts it covered.Â The FDIC also created a program to let banks issue bonds with FDIC backing to expand their borrowing capacity.Â Â The Fed intervened in the commercial paper market because it was creating a stealth run on the banks.Â  Companies were drawing down on revolvers, or considering it, because they were scared that the CP market would shut down and the banks would not honor their drawdown requests.Â  So in the U.S., we did everything we could to prevent a run on banks and to make depositors comfortable.Â  It was a tough battle, but one that we fought.Â Â Europe has just done the opposite. Europe has made a mockery of what little deposit insurance they have.Â Â Messing with depositors, especially in what seems like such an arbitrary fashion is just bad business.Â  Individuals react badly.Â  Individuals that see individuals reacting badly are often too poorly informed to know their neighbor is acting irrationally, and do the same thing.Â  Soon enough, the irrational action is the rational action because everyone else is doing it. So the first problem that Europe faces is depositors need to be concerned, especially in countries where the sovereign is in trouble and banks have relied on ELA. I am not sure how you fix this in the short term.Â  Any client that I have that has money in a bank that has received ELA money, or a country that is in trouble, I would say pull it out!Â  NOW!Â  Why keep it there?Â  Is the Bankia â€œspiderman towelâ€ enough of an incentive to risk being subject to some â€œgrand planâ€?Â  Bankia is a mess.Â  Spain relies on EU help for its banks.Â  Bankia was giving away spiderman beach towels to attract depositors.Â  After seeing what happened in Cyprus, take your money out, go to bed bath and beyond and buy your own beach towel. Seriously, I cannot imagine a single business, hedge fund, family office, or wealthy individual who doesnâ€™t take a close look at his or her deposits.Â  Why keep any more than the bare minimum to function? Greece has shown some signs of stabilizing, but I cannot think of a single reason to keep money in a deposit at a Greek bank.Â  Even with whatever depositor insurance there is.Â  Take it, take it out now. And Iâ€™m not being alarmist.Â Â Iâ€™m not saying the banks WILL do this.Â  I am saying there is a risk that it MIGHT happen, but you donâ€™t get paid enough to take that risk.Â  There are so few barriers to moving money, why would you keep it there?Â Â  It is simple.Â  No cost to move, and little reward for the risk you are currently taking. Remember all the talk about â€œPanEuropean Banking Unionâ€?Â  It reminds me of the old joke, â€œhow do you know when a lawyer is lying?â€ â€œHis lips are moving.â€Â Â  Any time Europe creates Pan anything, it never happens.Â  Remember all the stimulus spending?Â  So, before I digress (and I was about to) the risk of money shifting out of banks is real and the EU has little to stop it.Â Â If the EU canâ€™t win with the message that â€œCyprus was unique and this is better than the depositors deservedâ€ then we will see pressure on the weakest banks in the weakest countries. Up until know I have demonstrated that there is a chance that it is contained because the spin works. Even a run on the weakest banks in the weakest countries probably isnâ€™t bad for global markets.Â  It might be disastrous for the people in those countries, and I donâ€™t mean to be callous, but it may remain reasonably contained.Â  These banks are already shunned and arenâ€™t viewed as being particularly important.Â  If Greece and Portugal collapsed further, the markets, particularly in the U.S. could ignore it reasonably well.Â  After all, the Fed is pumping $85 billion a month into treasuries and mortgages. The risk is if investors start selling Spanish and Italian debt.Â  These bonds have had a great run and I have argued for a couple weeks are overvalued on fundamentals alone.Â  They each have their own political uncertainty and the economies are still somewhere between awful and heinous. This is where it gets a bit ugly in a hurry.Â  If bond yields start to go higher (and I think they will, if not within the first day by the end of the week) and then a few things start to happen That flow of events causes the Euro to drop to 1.20?Â  Causes European Bourses to drop 10% or more? How does Nikkei respond once the Yen stops depreciating?Â  How does the global economy react to this? Okay, that was an attention grabber.Â  I think S&amp;P is already overvalued.Â  I thought 1,500 was reasonable without this potential risk. I think there is a high risk of an overshoot.Â  Too many are too long, and we already have potential risks that QE to infinity is about to be replaced with QE for a long time.Â  It is easy to see a pullback, and what scares me is it is easy to see a pullback that overshoots very quickly and very far because there is so little real liquidity.Â Â I think we are almost at a record divergence between what people say (cautious) and how they are invested (aggressive). My current most likely scenario is this: One last thought which I mentioned already.Â  Russia took at least a week from the initial news to the disaster it became in 1998 (I have some great LTCM stories, but that is for in person meetings only).Â  Lehman also took time to develop.Â  The markets did not crater the day after Lehman and many bounced the following day.Â  It took time and other events to unfold before the real sell-off began. June 2007 was all time tights on IG.Â  October 2007, after first signs of too much complacency and dangers, was when we saw the all time highs on equities.Â  Then too it was the Fed, the discount window, infinite liquidity that drove things.Â  March 2012 felt similar to now, though less on the Fed but more on the data. The list goes on but the message is that no immediate reaction isnâ€™t an assurance that it isnâ€™t important and that price and mark to market losses trump almost everything else in this world. Anyways, time for some corned beef and cabbage and the realization that the only culture that might cook less healthy than Ukrainian, is Irish.

REUTERS/Gary HershornEconomists have been getting increasingly bullish on housing, with some expecting home prices to rise 8 percent this year.  To gauge the housing recovery analysts watch data points including home sales and inventory for insight into how tight the housing supply is. They also watch for sentiment among home builders. This week we see four important housing data points. Here's what to expect: While monthly data tends to be volatile, it gives us insight into developing trends in the housing market.
APA small private jet crashed in a neighborhood near the airport in South Bend, Indiana, this afternoon. The plane, a Hawker Beechcraft Premier, clipped one house, seriously damaged a second, and smashed into a third. At least three people have been taken to the hospital. Two of the four people on the plane were reportedly killed. The plane was trying to land in South Bend on a flight from Tulsa, Oklahoma. The pilot reported an electrical problem during the approach. The plane's tail number is N26DK. According to the FAA, it is registered to 7700 Enterprises Montana, which does business as DigiCut in Tulsa. The company is owned by a man named Wes Caven.

Bloomberg TVJefferies strategist David Zervos is his typically restrained self in his latest note on the Cyprus bailout, which involved taxing all bank depositors in a one-off confiscation: What happened to Cyprus on Friday evening was one of the most significant developments in the Eurozone since the Greek election last summer. To tax the bank deposits of savers sends an ominous message to the entire global investment community. All of us should really take a moment to consider what the governments of Europe have done. To be clear, they initiated a surprise assault on the precautionary savings of their own people. Such a move should send shock waves across the entire population of the developed world. This was not a Bernanke style slow moving financial repression against risk free savings that is meant to stir up animal spirits and force risk taking. This is a nuclear war on savings and wealth - something that will likely crush animal spirits. This is a policy move you expect from a dictatorial regime in sub-Saharan Africa, not in an EMU member state. If the European governments can clandestinely expropriate 7 to 10 percent of their hard working citizen's precautionary savings after the close of business on a Friday night, what else are they capable of doing? Why even hold money in a bank account? Are they trying to start a bank run? He's not a fan of the move, which he sees as having happened solely because Angela Merkel wants to get re-elected and there was no appetite for German taxpayers or politicians to see any more money go to "Russians" who have a lot of money in Cypriot banks. He sees the fallout as potentially severe: ...if the Cypriot parliament agrees to the tax, we should also see some serious instability develop at peripheral banks. Why keep your money at a Spanish or Italian bank when you can jump to Germany or France. And why even keep money in the Euroarea banking system at all. We should see huge outflows. Maybe I'm wrong and deposits stay sticky, but the risks here are HUGE and SCARY. Right now, I would argue that the risk of an EMU exit by Cyprus is real. And this is much more of a clear and present danger than anything happening in Italy or Spain. And even without passage of the tax, the potential for a bank run is very real. As a consequence, these events are MUCH MORE important than the Italian election results, or frankly any other issue in Europe. Read more Zervos at Markit hub ---&gt;
And here's how the Cyprus bailout is going down in the U.K. where uber-popular newspaper the Daily Mail proclaims the haircut on depositors to be THE GREAT EU BANK ROBBERY. An interesting angle here is that apparently a lot of U.K. service personnel have accounts in Cyprus, which the government will reimburse them for, costing U.K. taxpayers. @skynews
Flickr / Samantha Jade RoydsMore information is coming to light on the bailout (or "bail-in") of Cyprus, which involves an instant one-off tax on bank deposits in order to make banks whole. What's been particularly shocking to some is that the tax will hit the first 100K euros that Cypriots have in their bank accounts (at least according to the initial plan) even though deposits up to that amount are insured. Apparently the initial proposal (a 10 percent tax on holdings above 100K, and a 6.5 percent on holdings below) was the preference of the Cyprus government. Reuters reports that Germany was fine not hitting the sub-100K depositors (though it would have meant a higher levy on the above-100Kers) "It was the position of the German government and the International Monetary Fund that we must get a considerable part of the funds that are necessary for restructuring the banks from the banks owners and creditors - that means the investors,» German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble told public broadcaster ARD in an interview. "But we would obviously have respected the deposit guarantee for accounts up to 100,000,» he said. «But those who did not want a bail-in were the Cypriot government, also the European Commission and the ECB, they decided on this solution and they now must explain this to the Cypriot people." Of course, one of the key dynamics here is that a lot of the money in Cypriot banks comes from rich Russians (Oligarchs, mobsters, etc.) who use Cyprus as an offshore tax haven. This was one reason why there wasn't much political will to fully bail out the depositors. As Pawelmorski noted immediately after the deal was announced early Sunday, this one-off tax was something of a concession to the Russians because 10 percent isn't so horrible. And the Russians? The reason small depositors have been hit is that the losses inflicted would be much bigger if a) only large deposits b) only non-EU deposits were haircut. The data on Cyprus deposits is here (MUMs = Monetary Union Members). I would guess the thinking is that 10% is seen as a cost of doing business when it comes to money laundering, but 30% would probably finish Cypriot banking for good. If the infliction of losses on small depositors has a purpose, it’s probably to reassure the Russians that they are not being discriminated against. Yes, I may have thrown up a little in my mouth typing that. * So: senior bondholders and Russians helped at the cost of smaller locals. There’s more logic here than there appears at first glance – the primary aim of this programme is to hold the European banking sector together whilst having a vaguely realistic programme, not placing another huge bill on the core/Germany not ending the viability of Cyprus as an offshore banking sector. My own judgement is that inflicting costs on depositors in principle is an extremely important one, but that not sparing the small depositor is worse than a cruel piece of realpolitik – it is in fact a mistake. As one analyst we spoke to, who preferred not to be quoted by name put it: "Cut too deep and they price themselves out of the laundry business." Anyway, it looks like for political purposes they might have to cut deeper. There are already talks of shifting more of the burden to bigger depositors, and sparing the smaller ones.

Futures markets have opened to start the week, and the S&amp;P 500 is down nearly 1 percent on the Cyprus bailout deal, which includes a controversial haircut for depositors that has investors spooked.

Wikimedia CommonsGerman PM Angela Merkel and Cypriot President Nicos AnastasiadesGoldman Sachs is out with a reaction to the Cyprus bailout deal negotiated over the weekend, the most controversial part of which entails a haircut on bank deposits, something that hasn't yet been seen until now in the euro crisis saga. Goldman analyst Francisco Garzarelli says that while the deal could cause some short-term volatility, the fallout from Cyprus will likely be contained, assuming the controversial measures are able to survive a vote in the Cypriot parliament this week (which remains an open question). The biggest worry is about how depositors in other peripheral euro area countries like Spain will perceive the deal, and whether they will question the safety of the deposits in their own banks, which could also be in need of another bailout in the future. Garzarelli thinks that the ECB stands at the ready, writing, "Should there be evidence of deposit flight in peripheral countries, ad hoc operations, including the use of ELA facilities, are possible." He does say, however, that there are still two key takeaways from the Cyprus bailout deal. The first point is that this deal is a natural continuation of a trend developing on the euro bank bailouts front: private creditors are being asked to share more and more of the burden of restructuring. In this case, it meant that depositors had to take the loss, as there weren't many private bondholders to impose a haircut on to begin with. The point, though, is that the government is on the hook for less than if it underwrote the whole bailout with taxpayer money. This was the main reason why the EU and the IMF wanted deposit haircuts in the first place â€“ a bailout from the EU that footed the entire cost of the restructuring would have caused Cypriot government debt to rise to what the IMF deems unsustainable levels, and that means the IMF couldn't get involved. All of this is to say that the structure of the deal could be positive for Cypriot government debt, according to Garzarelli (emphasis added): The new â€˜policy doctrineâ€™. Tackling Europeâ€™s private and public debt-overhang involves making distributional choices. Starting with the rescue package for the Spanish cajas, Euro area authorities have resolved to a more extensive, and at times creative, burden sharing with bank creditors. The losses inflicted to holders of junior claims on Bankia in Spain and SNS in the Netherlands provide recent examples. The distance with what happened in Ireland, where the government underwrote in full bank liabilities, could not be greater. We flagged this key policy shift several months ago, arguing that public debt was likely to benefit on a relative basis to bank debt. Provided efforts to fulfill conditionality are made, as in the case in Portugal, Ireland and Spain, government bond holders have benefitted from the transformation of private debt into longer dated subsidized loans provided by the EFSF/ESM. Although these institutions are de iure senior creditors, in all existing programs their status has been relaxed and the funds are disbursed on a pari passu basis. In principle, the fortunes of Cypriot government bonds could be similar to Portugalâ€™s. But this depends on the Cypriot Parliament, which is being called to decide whether to endorse the deal or not, and the government, which will have to manage the adjustment. Second, given the trend toward increased burden-sharing, investors and lenders will be more selective about who their counterparties are. This means weaker banks will increasingly have to pay up more for funding than stronger banks. Garzarelli writes: The bank capital question. Especially in recession stricken European countries, including Italy, investors continue to question the capital adequacy of the mid-tier and small financial institutions, especially those that are un-listed and with less transparent balance sheets. Such scrutiny will not go away, and the Spanish and Cypriot precedents will reinforce the segmentation of the funding costs, both across EMU countries and increasingly within national banking systems. The ECB can provide liquidity, not capital. The vexed question of the direct interventions by the ESM in Euro area banks will come again to the fore. Those are Goldman's takeaways. Developments today â€“ including a proposed revision to the distribution of the haircut on depositors â€“ foretell an interesting week ahead in Cyprus.
The essence of the Cyprus bailout is that all bank depositors will be subject to a tax/confiscation/haircut/levy. As it currently stands, if you have over 100K euros in the bank, you'll pay a tax on of 9.9 percent. Under 100K euros and you'll pay 6.5 percent. This is incredibly controversial, and there is no guarantee that the plan, as it stands, will pass the Cypriot parliament. Dow Jones' Matina Stevis (who is in Cyprus now, and a must follow on Twitter for all sorts Greece/Cyprus/Eurozone stuff) tweets plans to make the tax more progressive. Matina Stevis This will ease the burden a bit on the little guy, and squeeze more from the wealthy Russian oligarchs and mobsters who are believed to hold a lot of cash in Cypriot bank accounts. Cyprus banks reopen on Tuesday. The next 24 hours will be very interesting.
Peter Kurdulija / FlickrMarkets are starting to open in the western hemisphere, and currencies are going wild to start the week on news of the Cyprus bailout deal, which includes a controversial deposit haircut. The euro is down 1.1 percent against the U.S. dollar and off a staggering 2.2 percent against the yen. Meanwhile, the yen is also up 1.1 percent against the dollar.  This could clearly develop into a risk-off move for everyone piling into the short-yen trade. As Michael Block of Phoenix Partners GroupÂ told Business Insider recently, "When this [Japanese rally] has a blip, a lot of folks long credit (including ones who are long structured products that are short these CDS and indices) are going to feel pain...and guess what?? The same folks are also short yen...long U.S. stocks...you get the picture. CORRELATION WILL BE THE DEATH OF US AGAIN." The EUR/JPY currency pair has tracked risk assets well recently, so this may be a sign that the broader rally in risk can unwind, depending on how much "contagion" the Cyprus deal causes. BofA Merrill Lynch's Steven Lee writes in a note to clients from Hong Kong: The Wellington Open kicks off both EURUSD (~1.2945) and USDJPY (~94.25) off sharply from NY/Fri closes, amidst uncertainty with the Cypriot Parliamentâ€™s vote on a deal reached with the Troika on the deposit levy.  BofAMLâ€™s Thanos Vamvakidis notes that the parliamentary vote inÂ CyprusÂ on Monday afternoon will be critical and, upon approval, the extent of bank deposit withdrawals when banks open on Tuesday. The bottom-line from Thanos: â€œThe government may not have the votes. As a result, the date of the vote is not known with certainty yet, but the official date is Monday 2pmÂ LondonÂ time. Banks will remain closed if the vote does not take place by Monday (Monday is an official holiday). A negative vote will be a shock with implications beyondÂ Cyprus.â€ Citi analyst Steven Englander said earlier, "The developments inÂ Cyprus will lead to EUR selling and USD, CHF, GBP, NOK and SEKÂ  buying (in that order)." The euro is barely moving against the Swiss franc (CHF), but is off 1.1 percent against the pound sterling (GBP), 1 percent against the Norwegian krone, and is actually up 0.1 percent against the Swedish krona.
TwitterThis process has been happening for a long time, but for those in finance, the value of Twitter is increasingly equaling or surpassing the value of traditional sell-side research from Wall Street analysts. This weekend's surprise bailout of Cyprus (surprise, because of the fact that depositors in Cypriot banks are seeing a 'one-off' tax) is a major moment in the evolution of financial information. Because the news was so surprising, and because there's so little time between when the bailout was announced early Saturday morning, and when trading begins Sunday evening, there's been an aggressive thirst for information and analysis on what it all means. But the sell-side has been fairly slow, and the Twittersphere has come to the rescue. The man everyone is reading is the pseudonymous twitterer @pawelmorski, who has written two must-read posts already on the Cypriot bailout. The first is here, and the second is here. In the second one he writes: After a surprisingly long gap, the verdicts from the Investment Bank research departments are dripping in. In short if you can sell euros at Fridayâ€™s close you probably should (you canâ€™t â€“ pre-pre-market at 6pm London or 7am Auckland is about a percent off) but the tone is one of wariness rather than panic. The absence of Street research interest probably tells a bigger story than what they actually say. Only Barclays bothered with the Sunday conference call, but weâ€™ll probably get more chances to dial in and be told that the research houses donâ€™t really know whatâ€™s going on. We can also enjoy the spectacle of people who right now couldnâ€™t name him interpret the importance of the intervention of Archbishop Chrysostomos. Not for the first time, Twitter was ahead of expensive analysts in concern about deposit haircuts. Among the few analysts who have put out stuff this weekend are SocGen's Kit Juckes and Sebastien Galy, currency experts who both happen to be on Twitter, and are extremely plugged into the pace of demand for information. In his latest email blast, SocGen's Kit Juckes basically tells trader clients to go read blogs and tweets: There are links to three (critical) analyses of the move below, from the FTâ€™s Alphaville blog, from the Schumpeter blog in the Economist and from the â€˜tweeterâ€™ Pawelmorski. I think they are the three best summations of the response of market respondents over the weekend.http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2013/03/16/1425732/a-stupid-idea-whose-time-had-come/ Â http://www.economist.com/blogs/schumpeter/2013/03/cyprus-bail-out Â  http://pawelmorski.wordpress.com/2013/03/16/cyprus-a-brutal-lesson-in-realpolitik-2/ That is pretty cool. Other journalists noted the same thing, how fully Twitter dominated traditional research shops. @thestalwart it really was. Thought it was just me for a while. Twitter vastly superior. @thestalwart @katie_martin_fx People don't even know that Cyprus' capital is Ljubljana! (#seewhatididhere). That's why it took so long. In a very unusual crisis, the local knowledge was key. So it was essential to follow someone like Yiannis Mouzakis (to get the reaction from the Cyprus street) or Nick Malkouzis and Efthimia Efthimiou for the Greek perspective. Bottom line: The value of Twitter (and Twitterers' blogs) have been growing for some time. But on a weekend, with a high degree of local knowledge and nuance required, the best information out there was all free. Now go read Pawelmorski's full post here &gt;
wwitv.comCyprus PresidentÂ Nicos Anastasiades just addressed the nation in a dramatic Sunday night speech regarding the bailout of Cyprus, which will see a one-time tax on everyone with cash in Cypriot banks. The basic gist of his message is this: Cyprus is in a huge crisis, and the country was given two choices, blackmail style. Either the government could get no help, and see a complete collapse of the economy and the financial system, as the banks ran out of money. Or Cyprus could take the "bailout" deal, which involves the painful tax on everyone's deposits. The President believes the latter options is superior. Here are some tweets to describe what the speech from folks on the ground, including Ekathimerini editor Nick Malkoutzis. #Anastasiades: We were given 2 blackmail-style options at Eurogroup. 1 would lead to disorderly bankruptcy. The other to stabilizing system #Anastasiades: If I opposed deposit tax, our financial system would eventually collapse #Cyprus #Anastasiades: The option we chose is not the one we wanted but the least bad option #Cyprus #Anastasiades: Depositors will not lose as they will be given equity. #Cyprus Anastasiadis: those that keep deposits for two years will get half the value of the levy in securitized gas revenues #Anastasiades: Deposit tax needs Parliament's approval. I will respect parties' decision. Road ahead is not easy #Cyprus
Koichi Kamoshida/Getty ImagesOne of the biggest problems presented by the euro crisis has been the financial connection between the banks and their governments. For the most part, the biggest holders of any country's sovereign debt are that country's own banking system. So, when the government comes under pressure in the sovereign debt markets, and the value of its debt decreases, it stresses the banks, who are holding so much of that debt on their own balance sheets. In turn, when the banks have to be bailed out, the cost falls largely on the public. This increases the country's government debt-to-GDP ratio, causing its sovereign bonds to come under further pressure. It's a vicious cycle. One of the big reasons banks can come under pressure in the first place, though, is because of deposit outflows. That's why deposit guarantee schemes are such a key component to further euro integration – people have to trust that their deposits are safe in Spanish or Italian banks, for example, or they will have no incentive to keep them there at the first sign of trouble. That's also why Société Générale strategist Sebastien Galy said that the EU broke the "cardinal rule" in negotiating this bailout deal with Cyprus, which includes a sizeable depositor haircut for those with money in Cypriot banks. Accounts with less than 100,000 euros will see 6.5 percent of their bank balances taken for the tax, while accounts with more than 100,000 are subject to a 9.9 percent haircut. JPMorgan's Alex White writes in a note to clients, "It is difficult to over-state the extent of popular anger in Cyprus over the bailout deal which was pulled together on Friday evening." And there may be further implications beyond Cyprus, says White (via Zero Hedge): Has Europe bazookaed itself in the foot? Even if we avoid a negative outcome this week, events in Cyprus invite broader questions about the region’s commitment, repeated ad nauseam since June to ‘break the feedback loop between sovereigns and banks’. The IMF warned as recently as Friday that the Euro area lacked an effective deposit guarantee framework (before agreeing to a haircut that adroitly proves its point). The Cypriot package reinforces the fact that existing deposit guarantee schemes are only as strong as the sovereign which backs them; something which is unlikely to go unnoticed in the rest of the region (although we think specific contagion risks are limited near-term). Other EU member states will likely be affected, there are significant numbers of UK depositors in Cypriot banks, some of whom the UK has now promised to protect (with echoes of the Icesave situation), and some potential contagion channels may not be obvious. It is notable that German policy-makers have been insisting on Cyprus’ significant ‘systemic relevance’ over recent days while pushing a package that may test it. Cyprus still has to approve the deal in parliament, a vote White says is too close to call. Furthermore, it could be subjected to additional delays. Monday's bank holiday has already been extended to Tuesday. In addition to the drama in Cyprus, it will also be important to watch peripheral countries for any signs that the deal is undermining confidence in those banks, given the fact that the EU has finally decided to go there – depositors have finally been "bailed in."
">Mike Baird via FlickrIn a few hours, when markets open, we'll get our first taste of how disruptive the controversial Cyprus bailout is. Remember, Cyprus has announced plans to tax bank depositors (6.5 percent of deposits for those with less than 100K eur in the bank; 9.9 percent for those with more than 100K in the bank). Already there are fears that this will create contagion in the rest of Europe. The announcement is also incredibly damaging to the public trust. Suddenly money in the bank is not money in the bank. The announcement did get one thing right. The only way this can work is if there's an element of surprise. No one should be able to see or believe it's coming, or else you get a bank run in advance of the haircut. This depositor haircut had been rumored about for awhile, but this has clearly been a surprise to most people. But the problem is, then you have to fulfill the tax and make it happen right away. Here's where it runs into problems. Cyprus banks are scheduled to open Tuesday, and the vote was to happen before then. So right away, you have a day of financial market activity on Monday. And then there might be delays in the actual vote, if it passes. So they did one thing right. They made a surprise move on a Friday night/Saturday morning. But this advantage goes away if they can't actually pass the tax law before banks are scheduled to open. This was actually all laid out in the winning entry to 2012's Wolfson Economics Prize (big thanks to Kelly Evans for the reminder on this), which explained how a country might go about leaving the Eurozone, and how important it was to do it in secret without any warning. Here's the key part of the Wolfson press release: The paper proposes that key officials from the exiting country meet in secret one month before publicly announcing a day of exit or â€˜D Day.â€™ Eurozone partners and other international monetary organisations would be notified of D Day three days before â€“ preferably on a Friday â€“ when a public announcement is made that the changeover to the new currency will take place at the start of the following week. Immediately after this announcement, domestic banks and financial markets should be closed to prevent capital flight. So the Friday announcement part was done. But markets will open Monday without anything set in stone.
What will be the market impact from the Cyprus bailout? Citi FX guru Steven Englander explains what to watch in the currency space. The developments in Cyprus will lead to EUR selling and USD, CHF, GBP, NOK and SEKÂ  buying (in that order). The issue is whether to believe that the Cyprus levy on depositors is one-off, but depositors and investors elsewhere could easily see this as another in a string of â€˜one-offsâ€™ and react badly. The risk-return to depositors in countries with weak banking systems may not favor taking the risk that Cypriot banking system was so unique that such a levy would never be considered elsewhere. The levy on deposits ostensibly covered by deposit insurance may also undermine confidence in weak banks.Â Â Â Â  The question is whether this becomes a full-blown crisis or a mini-crisis. Given the element of surprise, it is probably the case that euro zone policymakers will not have concrete measures prepared to convince depositors elsewhere that this will never happen again. So it seems likely in the first instance some resurgence of tail risk will re-appear and that there is a risk that we could see a downward spike in the euro and significant backing up of spreads. The reaction of The Swiss Franc (CHF) will be particularly interesting. When Europeans panic, they rush into Swiss assets and Swiss banks, as a safe haven in the middle of their own continent. During the worst of the euro crisis, the Swiss Franc soared against the euro.
Yahoo FinancePIMCO CEO Mohamed El-ErianMohamed El-Erian â€“ CEO of PIMCO, the biggest bond fund in the world â€“ is out with a reaction in the FT to this weekend's stunning Cyprus bailout deal. (The terms of the deal include an instant, 10-percent "tax" on deposits held in Cypriot banks before the banks re-open this week, which is being widely-panned as unfair by critics.) El-Erian also thinks it's unfair. "By choosing to include all deposits and not just the large ones, thus penalizing all segments of the population, officials opted for a highly regressive approach that also undermines the traditional construct of deposit insurance schemes around the world," he writes. Nonetheless, according to El-Erian, the EU had four valid reasons to make such an unprecedented move. First, El-Erian says, given the problem â€“ which stems partly from the enormous size of the Cypriot banking system relative to GDP â€“ depositors are partly to blame. "In entrusting funds to Cypriot institutions, depositors (and especially foreign depositors) inadvertently funded the over-extension of the banking system, both domestically and abroad," writes El-Erian. Second, much has been made about the "Russia angle" in the Cyprus deal. Because Cyprus is viewed as an off-shore tax haven for Russian oligarchs mafia types, many worry that the move could anger those depositors. El-Erian thinks that is a good thing, though: "By killing once and for all the notion that Cyprus is a safe and lax offshore haven, the levy serves to limit such intermediation [of funds from dubious origins] in future." The third valid reason for a deposit haircut, according to El-Erian, is that the alternatives seemed worse. Someone was going to lose out in this deal. For the two reasons outlined above, it might as well be the depositors. Finally, this will serve as a "wake-up call" for investors who thought the ECB had fixed everything with its "whatever it takes to save the euro" speech back in July. This, too, is a good thing, says El-Erian. That said, he thinks the decision to impose the levy against deposits is dangerous. Read Mohamed El-Erian's full take at the FT &gt;
An onerous term of the EU's bailout of Cyprus this weekend â€“ that depositors are subject to an instant, 10 percent "tax" on the money they have in the bank before banks re-open this week â€“ is sparking fears of systemic ripple effects across Europe, as others wonder if their deposits are still safe elsewhere. This is truly amazing, given the size of the tiny Cypriot economy relative to the rest of the euro zone, and shows how much of a symbolic issue â€“ namely,Â the breaking of trust in deposit safety in the EU â€“ this really is. The chart below puts the size of the Cypriot economy â€“ at $22.4 billion â€“ in perspective. Business Insider / Matthew Boesler, data from IMF 2012 staff estimates In fact, a better comparison for the size of the Cypriot economy might be to that of many mid-sized American cities, as the chart below shows. The Cypriot economy is smaller than Shreveport, Louisiana's. Business Insider / Matthew Boesler, data from the U.S. Conference of Mayors
World Economic Forum In the recent Italian elections, incumbent Prime Minister Mario Monti recieved a paltry 10 percent of the vote. In part it was because people didn't like his austerity/reform policies, but the real reason he was so disliked is that he was seen as a "puppet" for Brussels or Angela Merkel, doing their bidding in Italy. People do not like it when outsiders are calling the shots. Since the Eurozone crisis started, Germany has basically called the shots. This may be more de facto than de jure, but as the richest country, with the largest coffers, policy has essentially gone by what the Germans want. This is an unfortunate political reality. And now we see this on display again. Frederik Ducrozet, an economist with Credit Agricole, tells Business Insider: I think the Cyprus deal as it stands a big deal indeed, mostly in terms of bad signaling (as the ongoing normalisation in Eurozone capital flows remains fragile and vulnerable to sudden stops) and politics (Germany still imposing its rules despite growing discontent in the South). There were multiple reports which indicated that Germany told Cyprus: Confiscate your depositors' money or leave the Eurozone. That's a terrible political dynamic, and on top of Italy it exacerbates a bad overall political situation.
ABCHouse Speaker John Boehner agreed with President Barack Obama on Sunday that the U.S. does not have an "immediate" debt crisis — but that's where the agreement ends between the two leaders on how to reduce the deficit. "We do not have an immediate debt crisis," Boehner said on ABC's "This Week." "But we all know that we have one looming. And we have one looming because we have entitlement programs that are not sustainable in their current form. They’re going to go bankrupt." Boehner's comments are significant in the sense that they're similar to Obama's just last week in an interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos. "We’ve already cut $2.5 to $2.7 trillion out of the deficit," Obama said. "If the sequester stays in, you’ve got over $3.5 trillion of deficit reduction already. And, so, we don’t have an immediate crisis in terms of debt." When ABC's Martha Raddatz followed up with Boehner, he reiterated that the problem is not immediate. But "no one knows," he said, when it will be a problem — it could be "a year or two years, three years, four years." Obama's "point, as he went on to say in that interview, is that we don't really need to do anything at this point," Boehner said. "And I would argue that we do need to do something." To that point, Boehner emphasized spending cuts to entitlements as an immediate solution and repeating a familiar refrain he has pushed since the deal to avert the fiscal cliff in January. "The President believes that we have to have more taxes from the American people. We’re not going to get very far,” Boehner said. “The President got his tax hikes on January 1. The talk about raising revenue is over. It’s time to deal with the spending problem.”

Stephen Z on FlickrOn Thursday, Société Générale analysts made a prescient call on Europe. "It is far too early to dismiss the euro area crisis as a key [market] driver," wrote SocGen's Vincent Chaigneau. "We fear another shockwave in the spring." As it turns out, they may not have had to wait very long. News this weekend that the ECB, EU, and IMF bailout of the Cypriot banking system will include an instant 10 percent "tax" on bank deposits before banks re-open following Monday's holiday has already triggered runs on ATMs there. Now, the banks have a problem on their hands. "The Cypriot cabinet has declared Tuesday a bank holiday, for fear of capital flight, and this may even be stretched to Wednesday, as depositors are certain to withdraw huge sums from the Cypriot banks after the haircut imposed," reports Greek newspaper Kathimerini. Many market observers are expressing concerns that the decision could have a ripple effect throughout Europe come Monday when markets open. After all, if European leaders have decided to violate the unspoken rule of bank bailouts – that deposits are sacrosanct – what's to say it can't happen in a bigger eurozone country, like Spain? In a Sunday morning note to clients, Morgan Stanley economist Joachim Fels wrote, "I view this as a worrying precedent with potentially systemic consequences if depositors in other periphery countries fear a similar treatment in the future." "This will probably go down as an ill-thought-out rescue plan with consequences for peripheral Europe," says Galy. "It breaks a cardinal rule — namely, public trust on which money relies." The decision, therefore, has everyone scratching their heads. Why would European leaders play with that public trust in bank deposits? The SocGen report last week predicting a new eurozone "shockwave" this spring summed it up concisely: "Germany, now six months into a general election, will not be keen to share further risks and tolerate policy slippage." In other words, German politicians are up for re-election in September, and bailouts of other countries with German taxpayer funds don't help their cause much. So, Cyprus had to be made to share in the burden somehow — hence the haircut on deposits. "Conditionality is here to stay!" wrote SocGen economist Michala Marcussen in a reaction to the deal. "Indeed, there appears to be no change in the economic policy model of austerity and structural reform that has characterised the euro crisis to date." The Italian elections demonstrated that voters fed up with that austerity could ultimately break the confidence instilled in European markets since ECB President Mario Draghi gave his famous "whatever it takes to save the euro" speech in July. The Cyprus deal may finally be a good illustration of the risks markets face from the influence German voters as well — the ones ostensibly coming at the austerity debate from the exact opposite perspective. "It could be the trigger that our colleagues were expecting," says SocGen strategist Sebastien Galy.
Wikimedia CommonsYesterday the President of Cyprus Nicos Anastasiades said that Cyprus had two choices. It could pass a controversial bailout (which would involve a one-time tax on all bank deposits). Or it could see total financial ruin, and possible Eurozone ejection. So Anastasiades favors the former. And it needs to be voted on and passed. But that's no guarantee. From Ekathimerini: Leftist AKEL, social democratic EDEK and the Ecologists, as well as the European Party, that had sided with Anastasiades in the presidential runoff three weeks ago have expressed their intention to vote against the bill, which would mean there will be not be enough votes for the government's side. Anaasasiades is engaged in furious whipping to get more votes, and he will address the nation later today. Stay tuned.
Christopher Lotito at www.flickr.com The talk everywhere right now is about Cyprus, and the controversial bailout package that was agreed to in the early hours of Saturday morning. What makes it controversial is that to keep the banks from collapsing, depositors in Cypriot banks will be charged with a one-off tax of 9.9 percent if you have over 100,000 euros in your account or 6.5 percent if you have less than that. The levy is being called a "tax" but many Cypriot depositors are likely to see it as a stunning confiscation or a haircut. There are fears that the impact of the deal will go beyond Cyprus, and disrupt stability in other peripheral countries, as folks wonder whether this really is a one-off. Beyond that, this generally disrupts the flow of things since late last summer, when ECB generosity had been the tool to ease the Eurozone crisis. Supposedly Germany had balked at giving Cyprus money unless there was this depositor tax, and had suggested that the alternative was for Cyprus to leave the Eurozone. In a note out yesterday, Sebastien Galy of SocGen explained why this was unwise. This will probably go down as an ill thought out rescue plan with consequences for peripheral Europe. Savers beyond 100K EUR will participate in the restructuring, targeting presumably questionable moneys. It breaks a cardinal rule, namely public trust on which money relies. Had they thought their savings were at risk from a restructuring, savers would have run on local banks, hence it is different from a tax. Some peripherals will suffer at the opening in Europe and hit EUR. It could be the trigger that our colleagues were expecting. Twitter reports of cash machines running out in Cyprus for what such unverified information is worth. In other words, yes, the government may have the legal legitimate power to tax (savings), but this is a major trust destroyer. Meanwhile, the plan is not a done deal. It still needs to be voted on by Parliament, where the government has a very slim majority. There should be several developments today.

Library of CongressTapping California's vast shale reserves could create nearly 3 million jobs, a report from USC and the Communications Institute argues. We've previously discussed the incredible potential of the Monterey Shale, which stretches from Santa Barbara to San Francisco. The play contains more than 15 billion barrels of oil, some two-thirds of the United States’ shale oil reserves. Here's how the study's authors reckon a new "black gold rush" — the first one came in the 19th century — into the Monterey could relaunch the state: And here's the full table of their projections: Communications Institute Gov. Jerry Brown recently said he'd support developing the state's fossil fuel resources. Here's a part of a speech via a transcript provided by the Institute: oil off the City of Long Beach has put hundreds of millions of dollars into building necessary facilities at our Cal State University. Very important. In the Kern Basin, lots of oil resource. So we want to get the greenhouse gas emissions down, but we also want to keep our economy going. And that’s that balance that’s required. And we’re not fighting the laws of nature. The study's authors call the above table, which they've deemed "the North Dakota path," their "most conservative" forecast. Not bad.
flickr / Denise KrebsLast week, JPMorgan said we're not that far from a "picture perfect world." Morgan Stanley said the U.S. economy was approaching an "inflection point" in mid-2013 from which growth would really start taking off. Now, BofA Merrill Lynch is out with a new report, titled "Buy America: The American dream is back." BAML strategists Ralph Preusser and Athanasios Vamvakidis write (emphasis added): Markets have fallen in love with the US. This is a significant change from spending the last five years wondering which economy was the worst, the US, Europe, the UK, or Japan. After repeated positive US data surprises in recent weeks, and particularly the very strong non-farm payroll number last Friday, buy America has become the main market theme, with the USD appreciating and US equities reaching new highs. The US housing market is also beginning to show signs of a sustainable recovery (see Housing Watch). The strong US performance despite the substantial fiscal tightening in the months ahead as the sequester kicks in makes the US even more attractive. Just imagine how faster the recovery would have been if the US had a better fiscal policy. Our bullish USD view for 2013 has so far turned out to be right for the wrong reasons. We have been concerned about the impact of fiscal tightening on the US and the global economy, expecting an increase of demand for the USD in a risk-off market correction. However, the strength of the US recovery so far this year has surprised markets and the correlation between risk appetite and the USD has now turned positive. This has helped our EURUSD straddle trade originally recommended two months ago (see FX Alpha). The comeback of the dollar – and specifically, this return to positive correlation with stocks – has been a hot topic. Preusser and Vamvakidis continue: We have now introduced a short EURAUD recommendation, to take advantage of the current benign environment of rising equities, improving US data and declining volatility (see FX Alpha). For rates investors, we would watch out for what the Fed thinks about the recent improvement in the housing market and its implications for wealth and eventually the labour market, rather than what the equity market thinks (see Liquid Insight). Big Picture Theme 1 argues that the recent simultaneous advance of the USD and equity markets suggests the possibility of a new norm that may be driven by expectations of US energy independence. The market implications of such a shift could be profound and we are bullish the USD and US cyclical assets, bearish oil and FX vol, and bearish TIPS breakevens. In other words, it's a lot of the same broad trade recommendations we've heard from several other analysts. Citi introduced a near identical trade lineup this week. Long the dollar. Long stocks. Short bonds.

On Tuesday, Jefferies strategist Sean Darby cranked up his year-end target for the S&amp;P 500 to1,673 from 1,565, making him the most bullish strategist on Wall Street. "Better-than-expected 4Q earnings and forward guidance, a broadening in the earnings base, ongoing share buybacks and continuous rotation out of fixed income ought to keep US equities well bid," wrote Darby. Business Insider recently asked Darby for the chart that worried him most. "The recent trend in mergers and acquisitions might indicate that financial assets have become overheated in the short-term -- or it may indicate that Fed policy is beginning to work in raising animal spirits," said Darby. For now, he seems to be more convinced of the latter. Here's the chart Darby sent us: Business Insider
When I was younger, so much younger than today, I never needed anybody's help in any way. But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured, Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors. â€“ John Lennon, the Beatles (From Cafayate, Argentina) There are some who worry whether the path that Argentina has taken to monetary ruin on multiple occasions (and that it seems intent on taking again) is one that the US may also find itself on. That worry has crossed my mind a few times, I must confess. Today we will look at Argentina more in depth. From a monetary perspective, it deserves attention. And once again there will be opportunity. Let me jump right to the conclusion: Just as Spain is not Greece, because each chose a unique route to economic malaise, the US is not Argentina. We are perfectly capable of avoiding Argentinaâ€™s problems while cooking up ones that are all our own. But there are some worrisome and potentially instructive issues in Argentina. Argentina: A Lesson in Chaos At the turn of the 20th century Argentina was one of the richest countries in the world, due primarily to its vast and fertile farmlands. In 1913, GDP per capita was about equal to those of France and Germany and close to that of the US. By 1950, though, Argentina's GDP per capita wasnâ€™t even half that of the United States. (You can read a short, graphic history of the economic chaos that has been Argentina from the 1930s on at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_history_of_Argentina.) Currency values plummeted. Inflation reached 5,000% at one point in the 1970s. Prices increased by a factor of 20 billion from 1975-1991 â€“ over 300% per year. In 1983, at the urging of the IMF, a new peso was introduced at a value of 10,000 to one of the old pesos. Ouch. And that was just the beginning! The Peronist government of Menem, elected in 1989, made a deal with the IMF, which promptly collapsed, leading to a rapid 12,000% inflation. On January 1, 1992, a new monetary reform replaced the austral (the name of the currency at that time) with the new peso at a rate of 10,000 australs for one peso. Another 10,000-fold devaluation â€“ twice within ten years! The peso was now fixed to the dollar. The following chart shows the value of the peso in dollar terms since 1936. The numbers are in German, which makes the chart just too ironic not to use. Note that each one of the horizontal bars represents a devaluation of 90%! (The vertical axis is a log-10 scale.) Maudlin Economics I first came to Argentina in 1993. The country had just emerged from economic chaos. Real per capita income had dropped by 20% in the previous 20 years. But even with the chaos, the restaurants were busy at 10 PM, when Argentines like to eat! Over the succeeding years, with a fixed dollar exchange rate, some industries could not compete and trade deficits grew. As in Greece today, the only way to create a fiscal balance was labor-price devaluation, which was decidedly unpopular. So Argentina went off the dollar standard, and the value of the peso dropped by 50%. In December 1999 Fernando de la RÃºa was inaugurated President, seeking assistance from the IMF shortly thereafter. In March 2000, the IMF agreed to a three-year $7.2 billion stand-by arrangement with Argentina, conditioned on a strict fiscal adjustment and the assumption of 3.5% GDP growth in 2000 (actual growth was 0.5%). In late 2000, Argentina began to experience severely diminished access to capital markets, as reflected in a sharp and sustained rise in spreads on Argentine bonds over U.S. Treasuries. In December, the de la Rua government announced a $40 billion multilateral assistance package organized by IMF. The uneven implementation of fiscal adjustments and reforms, a worsening global macroeconomic environment, and political instability led to the complete loss of market access and intensified capital flight by the second quarter of 2001. Argentine debt, held mostly in bonds, was massively sold short and the government found itself unable to borrow or meet debt payments. [Shades of later Greece!] In December 2001, a series of deposit runs began to have a severe impact on the health of the banking system, leading the Argentine authorities to impose a partial deposit freeze. With Argentina no longer in compliance with the conditions of the expanded IMF-supported program, the IMF decided to suspend disbursements. At the end of December, in a climate of severe political and social unrest, the country partially defaulted on its international obligations; in January 2002, it formally abandoned the convertibility regime. (Wikipedia) The economic and political crisis that followed was arguably the worst since the country gained its independence from Spain in 1816. By the end of 2002, the economy had contracted 20% since 1998.Over the course of two years, output fell by more than 15%, the Argentine peso lost three-quarters of its value, and registered unemployment grew to 25%. Income poverty in Argentina grew from an already high 35.4% in October 2001 to a peak of 54.3% in October 2002. My friend and Uruguayan business partner Enrique Fynn tells stories of coming to Buenos Aires and hearing new prices being announced hour by hour over a public address system in a grocery store. He had dollars, which bought him lots of goods to take back on the ferry.. People who were prescient and had money were able to buy apartments in BA and land in Argentina at what can only be called fire-sale prices. Argentina on Sale I remember coming to Argentina about three years ago. I thought prices in Buenos Aires were high â€“ the peso was about 3.50 to the dollar. When I visited again last November, prices were â€œreasonableâ€ by my travel standards, and here in Cafayate I found good value. I have friends who are building homes here much more cheaply than they could in the US. And the quality is high; there are some real craftsmen here. Their stonework is exquisite. I was in Buenos Aires last Friday. The official exchange rate is now 5.50 pesos to the dollar. The street price is 7.75, on its way to 8. But the largest bill is a 100-peso note, which is now worth less than $13. Using a credit card costs at least an extra 10%, if not 20%; but the prices you are quoted for using a credit card instead of cash are higher to start with, before the surcharge, so using a card ends up costing you about an extra 40%. But you need to carry a lot of cash if you want to buy anything expensive. (Be very careful if you do not know your way around. I am told there are lots of counterfeit bills passed off on tourists. Not that I exchanged anything, of course this is all theoretical, for illustration purposes.) I was staying in the Recoleta area, which is one of the most expensive areas of the city and a wonderful place to while away a day or two. But things were cheap. A simple lunch for two on a fashionable street was around $15. We had a fabulous meal at a restaurant we stumbled on, called Sirop Folie. (I will go again!) It would have been $150 at a comparable place in Dallas or NYC (or Europe), but it cost us just $50, including tip. I left my computer mouse in Dallas but was able to pick one up for $6. Vegetables and cheeses were around half what I am used to paying in Dallas. I began to â€œshopâ€ in order to look at prices. By US standards, Argentina is on sale. And this was in the high-rent district. On the way to Cafayate, there were signs on the road for chicken dinners for the local trade priced at $2 equivalent. Our dinner last night for two was less than $40 (all in) at what is considered one of the better local restaurants, Vinas de Cafayate (fabulous menu!). The place was packed by 10 pm, as I was leaving. So Argentina seems inexpensive today. Not a definitive study, admittedly, but the trend is clear. President Kirchner is again experimenting with price controls. (Peron infamously tried to control even restaurant menu prices in the late 1940s â€“ youâ€™d think he would have known better). The last time price controls failed was in 2005. Now, Argentina has limited beef exports in the futile hope that doing so will drive down beef costs. All that has happened is that cattle herds have been reduced and exports are down. Similar export controls to try to keep bread prices down have seen wheat production fall. Brazil has seen its cattle exports explode in 20 years, while Argentinaâ€™s have not grown at all as the government tries to control production and export prices. Argentina used to be the worldâ€™s largest beef exporter, but Brazil now has a herd almost four times the size of Argentinaâ€™s. How many jobs have been lost to Brazil? One long-time exporter says, â€œThere are developed countries, emerging countries, and then there's Argentina." Want to see something sad? An illustration of what governments can do to an industry by trying to control it? Look at this chart. Argentina is now down at #11. Tiny neighbor Uruguay exports twice the beef and veal. Maudlin Economics The government is committed to a path of monetization. Inflation is denied by government statisticians, but it is at about 30% and rising. While the government is putting pressure on grocers to maintain prices, which always leads to shortages, as of this morning you can still find anything you want at the local equivalent of a well-stocked Hypermart. Why Donâ€™t You Just Stop? I sat down for what became a lengthy conversation with Juan Carlos Romero, the current senator from Salta Province. Juan Carlos is my age (which is to say a young 60ish) and is the very image of as an old-style patron, straight from central casting. He was governor of the province from 1995 to 2007 (itâ€™s the family business â€“ his father was governor, too) and has been vice-president of the senate and on a national presidential ticket. He is a very successful businessman. We met last time I was here, and I hit it off with both him and his son, Juan Sebastian. I related to him my surprise at prices and inflation. The last time I was in the Recoleta, in November, there was a protest march (quite peaceful and civilized, if enthusiastic and noisy) of some 700,000 people in the center of town, along 9 de Julio Avenue, which is the widest avenue in the world. It is impressive to walk down. But things have only gotten worse since then. â€œHavenâ€™t you seen this movie before?â€ I asked. â€œDonâ€™t you know how this ends? What part of seeming insanity do you keep wanting to repeat? Why canâ€™t you stop it?â€ I will summarize Juan Carlosâ€™s answers from the notes I took. Argentines donâ€™t want to hear bad news (does anyone?). Monti gave the Italians bad news, and he only got 9% of the vote. The bureaucracy is out of control in Argentina, and it just keeps growing and creating costs. There are too many subsidies to certain businesses. And, as a result of votes during the last crisis, power is now concentrated in the presidency and a few key positions. There are not the checks and balances we are used to between branches of government in the States. Both major parties voted to nationalize pensions. Government benefits and subsidies are given to a large number of people, who then vote for more government benefits. â€œIn Argentina, we have the ability to make the same mistake many times, and nothing happens to change things. Why? Because there is a pervasive belief that the state can provide all that people need: jobs, welfare, everything.â€ Perhaps, he mused quietly, that attitude is a heritage from colonial days, when the King of Spain controlled the country and power and privilege and benefits came from the King. Aerolineas loses $2 million a day, but people believe it is better than a private company. The government is not seen as something owned by the people but as something that exists to solve problems and take care of the people. Both parties and a majority of voters seem to agree that government is better than the private sector. Some sectors have few controls, and others are tightly controlled. â€œEven so,â€ I asked, â€œcanâ€™t those in control see that inflation is bad?â€ The problem, he explained, is that those who have the ear of the president see inflation as a way to growth and thus a good thing. Those in power deny there is inflation and think it is caused by â€œcommercialâ€ interests that selfishly raise prices. Kirchner and those around her actually believe that their current policies will work. Meanwhile, 42% of GDP is government expenditures. In a country of vast lands and unsurpassed beauty, more than half the people live in one city, Buenos Aires. (I think they all try and get out on the roads when I am going to or from the airport.) And that urban power base is central to Kirchnerâ€™s control â€“ she won the last election handily. As I walked through the Recoleta, I thought I saw stress on the faces of the people I encountered. You can talk to businesspeople and sense the stress. How do you cope with such repeated episodes of chaos? Argentines who have money keep it outside the country. As one person told me, â€œIn America, you buy gold to protect yourselves. We buy dollars.â€ The national sport â€“ second only to fÃºtbol â€“ is tax evasion. (They come by both naturally, as about 60% of the population has Italian ancestors.) And yet there is a thriving business community. The skyline is much more impressive in BA than it was 20 years ago. Argentines are an educated people. And things can and do get done. Jon Malinski is a Minnesota businessman. He invested in a vineyard in Mendoza and recently bought a vineyard here in Cafayate, in one of the better growing regions. Two years ago, he broke ground on a massive, sophisticated, modern winery here. It is now open for business. He hosted a dinner on my first night here (accompanied by a huge lightning display back up in the mountains). I have been to a few wineries in my time. This one was rivaled in elegance by only a few in the Napa Valley or France and the Ferragamo estate in Italy. Note: He bought the land and decided to build, and the winery was completed in two years. In the US, for an undertaking this large, you canâ€™t even get the approval process underway in two years. One of Jonâ€™s competitors told me he probably spent $20 million. For all the Argentinean government controls, in certain sectors you are free to do what you want. This region is booming. Building is going on everywhere. People smile on the streets and are patient with your mangled attempts at Spanish. There is a rather amazing contrast between the macroeconomic situation of the country and life on the street. Soon, the peso will once again come to be seen as a medium that will only be usable in immediate exchanges. Unless something is done, Argentina is going to repeat its past. Unlike Germany, which still remembers the Weimar hyperinflation, Argentina just seems to shrug off its past. The economy has recently survived on a boom in soybeans, but there is not much else to rely upon. Argentina is on sale. I think prices relative to the dollar will rise. This is one sale where the last day is not yet known. Think about coming down here next fall and enjoying the time with me. Can the US Experience Argentinean Inflation? I know some readers think the worst of the Fed, and I am not a fan in general (and am opposed to the current QE policy), but I simply canâ€™t conceive of the FOMC voting to monetize if inflation tops 10% again. I think there would be serious efforts to curb QE (monetization) at 5-6% inflation, although until we reach that level I think it will be tolerated. With higher inflation than that, voters would simply rebel. Think the â€™70s: both Ford and Carter lost in part because of the economy and inflation. In theory, any country can experience Argentinean-style inflation. It just takes a printing press (which today simply involves pushing some electrons around), a willing central bank, and a complicit citizenry. US citizens have an inherent distrust of government, although I admit that is slowly changing. Two factoids: Â  â€œHow,â€ I had asked Juan Carlos, â€œcan you let it happen?â€ But how, indeed, can we?

The Andes, Sonoma, Manila, and Singapore Tomorrow I venture off with Doug Casey, David Galland, and Olivier Garret to Bill Bonnerâ€™s hacienda at Guafin, a few hours from here. A few years back, Bill bought this enormous (200,000-acre) ranch of mostly worthless land some 8,000 feet above sea level, but with magnificent views of the Andes, and he sneaks off there every now and then. I have been to his place in Ouzilly, France (a little easier to get to!) on several occasions, but this one sounds like a real fixer upper. Buying places that need lots of work seems to be his personal addiction (otherwise known as an expensive hobby), but it is a socially acceptable one and fun for his friends who drop in on him. I have known Bill for 30 years, since we were both young and starting out in the writing and publishing business. He has been a huge success, while I am hoping to be a late bloomer. But I have never had a moment with him that was not enjoyable, and most were thought-provoking. He does make me think.&lt; /p&gt; He is one of my favorite writers in the business. I have often said that I feel like a house painter in front of a Rembrandt when I read Billâ€™s musings. Actually, he is more than just a writer; he is a consummate storyteller, a raconteur worthy of the name. I am looking forward to magnificent vistas and a new adventure but also to great conversations with old friends â€“ war horses who have seen lots of battles but are not yet ready to be put out to pasture. I will be speaking at a special one-day event in Sonoma, California, on April 5. My friend Mike Shedlock is holding a charity fundraiser to support research into ALS (Lou Gehrigâ€™s disease. You can find out more at Mish's Conference. My own conference (co-sponsored with Altegris Investments) is May 1-3. It is filling up rapidly. The line-up of speakers is the best I have seen anywhere this year. We offer an early-bird registration, which is about to run out. Because of security regulations, we do have to limit attendance to accredited investors and those in the securities/investment business. You can start the process by going to the Strategic Investment Conference page. I hope to see you there. I will be in Singapore for a speech April 18-19. I was going to go to Cambodia and Angkor Wat, but it is their New Year, so I will postpone that trip till the next Asia speaking trip and see Manila instead, where I have some old friends and have never been. I then hop back to San Francisco for a speech for the National Association of Surety Bond Producers (NASBP) on April 22. Some final thoughts on Cafayate. This is just a hopping little town with a magnificent vista. Perfect climate in the tropics but at 5,000 feet. The mountains change color throughout the day. My friends have built a first-class resort. The spa is truly world-class, there is a great gym, and a massage will run you about $40. The golf course is the longest one in South America, which means there is more room for me to lose balls. There are very good to great places to eat. I am not one for road trips, but the drive through the canyon to get here is stunning, well worth a few hoursâ€™ diversion. The people who seem to collect here are about as eclectic as you can get. Nearly everyone has great stories to regale you with. And they are just generally nice people. This is going to be quite the community. I will plan to be here more, but when I am, letâ€™s see how much writing I actually get done. Somehow, the memo that sequestration was supposed to be about austerity has gotten lost. There have been 2,600 new federal jobs posted since the introduction of the bill, 600 at Homeland Security, which was going cut workers, making lines longer at airports. I guess I am new to this off brand of austerity. But what do I know? I know it is late, and I need a few hoursâ€™ sleep. Have a great week.
