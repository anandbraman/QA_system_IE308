NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors may be tempted to shy away from stocks in the next week or two as the latest version of the fiscal follies plays out in Washington. It's understandable. The prospect of a government shutdown or, worse, default on the federal debt, rekindles memories of 2011 when Washington's infighting prompted the loss of the United States' triple-A credit rating and was a primary driver behind the stock market's last full-on correction. The sense from Wall Street analysts this time, however, is that the current drama is likely to feature more bluster than bravado and contains overblown threats. "Looking back at the pattern that has emerged since the debt ceiling fiasco back in 2011, the Republican leadership got the message that if there is a government shutdown, most likely their party is going to get blamed," said Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin. "They're going to be very sensitive to that public sentiment as we get closer to a midterm election year" in 2014, Jacobsen said. "In spite of all the brinkmanship being talked about ... there will be a deal and then we will move on," said Stephen Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Equity Management in San Francisco. This autumn's standoff comes with two separate but related deadlines. First, failure to come up with a budget deal by the end of the month risks a federal government shutdown starting October 1. Then, by mid-October lawmakers must vote to raise the federal debt ceiling to prevent a default. The posturing has been under way for weeks. In the latest move, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives passed legislation on Friday to fund federal agencies through mid-December but also inserted a provision killing President Barack Obama's landmark healthcare overhaul. Democrats, who control the Senate, have said they will strip out that provision when the bill comes before the Senate, most likely next week. Wall Street players are sanguine about events unfolding in Washington. EMPTY THREAT "Uncertainty will probably rise ahead of these events, but we think this is likely to be short-lived and probably less severe than some other recent episodes," said a Goldman Sachs research note. In fact, the current episode could prove to be an empty threat, like the so-called "fiscal cliff," last December. After weeks of dire predictions of big tax hikes and draconian spending cuts if no deal was reached, lawmakers came to a last-minute accord, and the market kicked into high gear for 2013. The S&amp;P 500 is up more than 22 percent year to date on a total return basis, including re-invested dividends. "While we could get a pullback on worries about the debt ceiling and the continuing resolution, my guess is it will go the same way as the fiscal cliff went - a bunch of sound and fury signifying nothing," said Jeffrey Saut, chief investment strategist at Raymond James Financial in St. Petersburg, Florida. "If the market pulls back on (Washington) worries, I think it's a buy," said Saut. As the budget battle heats up, the lack of angst among investors was reflected in a fall in the CBOE Volatility Index &lt;.VIX&gt;, Wall Street's favorite measure of fear. It ticked down to 13.12 on Friday and has posted three straight weeks of losses for a total drop in that period of 23 percent. Next week on Wall Street, the widely followed Dow Jones industrial average &lt;.DJI&gt; will open Monday with three new components as Goldman Sachs &lt;GS.N&gt;, Visa &lt;V.N&gt; and Nike &lt;NKE.N&gt; replace Bank of America &lt;BAC.N&gt;, Hewlett-Packard &lt;HPQ.N&gt; and Alcoa &lt;AA.N&gt;. ANOTHER TAPER TANTRUM Even though the market has a low chance of disruption from the fiscal fighting, there might still be a bearish signal from Washington. "Fiscal retrenchment" in Washington was one of the reasons cited this week by the Federal Reserve for not reducing its stimulus program of $85 billion a month in bond purchases. The policy has kept downward pressure on interest rates and has helped lift the S&amp;P 500 &lt;.SPX&gt; this year. The reduced likelihood of a political impasse over the budget could then open the door for the Fed to begin tapering as early as late October when it holds its next policy-setting meeting. That possibility was raised by St. Louis Fed President James Bullard on Friday, noting that the decision still depends on data about the economy. He also said the Fed has maneuvering room as along as inflation is low. "One of the things that pushed the Fed into the precautionary side was the fiscal issues. They realized what sort of effect that could have on the economy and decided not to taper," said Wells Fargo's Jacobsen. "It is entirely possible that on October 30 we could see a slight tapering because we'll have passed some of the chaos in (Washington) D.C. if there is a resolution of the budget issues," he said.

Twitter/@GOPLeaderThere wasn't much surprise in the House of Representatives' vote to avoid a government shutdown while stripping all discretionary funding for the Affordable Care Act.  But three Congressmen did buck party lines in the vote. One Republican voted against the bill, and two Democrats voted in favor of it. Rep. Scott Rigell (R-Va.) was the lone Republican to vote against the bill (four Republicans did not vote). But his objection didn't really relate to Obamacare. He voted no because he opposes continuing resolutions, stopgap bills like this one that fund the whole government for a period of months. He wants to get back to regular budget order: funding the government through 12 separate, year-long bills for different functional areas. Rigell also represents a military-heavy district, and he decried the continuing resolution's failure to address sequestration cuts. "This CR fails to address the sequester that is negatively impacting those who wear our nation’s uniform and is the result of Congress’ inability to pass the 12 appropriations bills necessary to properly fund the government on time. What is needed is a comprehensive solution to our nation’s fiscal challenges, including a replacement for sequestration," Rigell said in a statement.  The two Democrats who defied most of their party were Reps. Jim Matheson (D-Utah) and Mike McIntyre (D-N.C.). They both represent conservative districts and voted against the Affordable Care Act when it first passed in 2010. Both Congressmen said in statements that they felt it irresponsible to let the government shut down, though Matheson made it clear that he opposed the inclusion of the language that defunds Obamacare.  McIntyre, though, has voted dozens of times to repeal Obamacare in its entirety or in certain portions. And he said that's why he voted to defund it on Friday.  “My record on the health care law has been crystal clear – I voted against it when it was first considered, have voted to repeal it dozens of times, and today voted to defund it," McIntyre said. "The need for health care reform is clear, but this law is not the right approach for our citizens, communities, and businesses.”

BlackRock: 2 Major Issues Foretell A Coming Retirement Funding Crisis (Advisor Perspectives) BlackRock's Russ Koesterich thinks U.S. policymakers spent the last five years tackling the financial crisis, but have failed to prepare for the next one, the 'retirement crisis.'  First, "government debt levels remain elevated, a troubling prospect considering that the U.S. government has failed to address entitlement reform and an aging population will put increasing demands on state coffers," he writes in Advisor Perspectives. Second, "U.S. household savings are inadequate to fund an increasingly lengthy retirement." We've Never Seen A Bigger Push Into Stocks Than We Did This Week (BofA Merrill Lynch) Investors put $25.9 billion into global stock market mutual funds and ETFs in the week ending September 18. Meanwhile bond funds saw $1.1 billion in outflows for the same week. This was the biggest push into stocks on record and was "driven by massive ETF inflows to SPY, IWM, EEM, GDX," according to BofA Merrill Lynch chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett. He says these inflows indicate "big pre-FOMC short-covering." BofA Merrill Lynch Global Investment Strategy, EPFR Global, Lipper FMI SEC Charges Advisor And Broker With Insider Trading (SEC) The SEC has charged Tibor Klein, a New York-based financial advisor, and Michael Shechtman a broker in Florida, with insider trading. From the release: "The SEC alleges that Tibor Klein, who lives on Long Island and is president of Klein Financial Services, learned confidential information about Pfizer Inc.’s planned acquisition of King Pharmaceuticals. He misappropriated the information and traded in advance of the public announcement for illicit profits of more than $300,000 for himself and his clients." "The SEC also charged Klein’s close friend Michael Shechtman, a stockbroker living in South Florida who was tipped by Klein and traded on the non-public information for more than $100,000 in illegal profits." BRIAN BELSKI: The S&amp;P 500 May Go To 1900 Now That The Fed Has Spoken (BMO Capital Markets) Brian Belski has revised up his S&amp;P 500 year-end price target to 1,800 from 1,650. "Sometimes bull markets have a mind of their own, and this one is no different," Belski wrote in a note to clients. "Furthermore, lackluster bond market performance, coupled with expansive equity gains, will likely spur renewed fund flows into equities, especially as the calendar flips to 2014. Thus, we believe the S&amp;P 500 could reach a potential peak of 1,900 before the economy catches up." But Belski does acknowledge that this run up in stocks has more to do with "liquidity-driven momentum" rather than fundamentals, and that the higher they rise, "the greater the likelihood of a sharp price reset once the Fed decides to start taking away the punch from the bowl." $200 Million Advisor Team Jumps From JP Morgan To RBC (Investment News)  Richard DiChiaro and Bob Bourgault, two advisors from JP Morgan Securities with more than $192 million in assets, have joined RBC Wealth Management in Providence, Rhode Island.

YouTubeTime to get in the game.As a father of two daughters, I know I’ll never forget certain special times: their birth, Day 1 of Kindergarten, baby’s first piano recital, menacing the punk who is picking her up to go to the prom, and the police report I’ll file when she quits college to run off with the lead singer of that Norse Death Metal Band.[1] Moments you never forget, like a first stock market investment. As an ex-banker with a daughter, however, other unforgettable milestones also stand out.  Like, for example, when the eldest first beats me at Monopoly, when she makes her first stock market investment, and when she learns how to program Excel to calculate discounted cash-flows.[2] Dear readers, that stock market investment moment has arrived, so I thought I would bring you along with us on this beautiful father-daughter bonding journey. Grab your spreadsheets, and your handkerchiefs. My daughter’s life savings First, a confession:  I am clearly a mean Daddy.  Until last week, my oldest had $370 in her bank account, the sum total of eight years of hoarding cash gifts from Aunts, Uncles, Grandparents, Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy.  In addition to the savings account, she also boasted $31 in cash that she scored at my Sunday evening poker game with the neighborhood dads.[3] A few months ago I realized – here’s the mean Daddy part – that if she had a total of $500, I could take her hoard and buy some public shares in a custodial account.  In that way I could simultaneously: Now, buying shares in public companies ranks #748 in the priority list for what 8-year-old girls want to do with their life savings, but again, I am a mean Daddy and that’s the kind of cruelty I subject my daughters to.  I’m an ex-banker, what did you expect? The manipulation begins I started in on the project a few weeks back. “Do you know you have about $400 saved up?  And do you know what would be fun to do with your money?” Silence. “We could pick a stock to buy and then track it in the newspaper, or even online!” I said cheerfully.  Perhaps a bit too brightly. “Okay …” she looks at me, with a healthy dose of mistrust.  (I’m so proud of her.) “So do you want to do that?” Picture me, with a hopeful face. Silence. A few weeks later I have an awful idea.  A wonderful, awful idea.  On a Friday afternoon, after school. “Do you remember that plan I had for investing in a stock with your savings?” “Kinda.” “Let’s work on that today.” I explain to her my plan, which is to walk around the kitchen, living room, and her bedroom, picking all the things that are made by big companies.  And then from there I’ll have her pick which one would be the coolest company to invest in.  And also, I mumble to her in that fast voice explaining terms and conditions in the final five seconds of every car commercial or Levitra advertisement, we’ll need to pick a stock that we can invest in directly through the company, with an automatic dividend reinvestment plan, without having to go through a brokerage company. Extra incentive Then I told her if we did my stock investing plan with her $401 in life savings, I would kick in an extra $100, so she could have $500 total to invest in a company.  She’s no Warren Buffett (yet) but I think she quickly understood the good deal I was offering.  And I knew that she needed at least $500 to invest in a company the way I preferred, which again was to pick a stock that we can invest directly in through the company, with an automatic dividend reinvestment plan, without having to go through a brokerage company. What we did That afternoon, we spent 30 minutes with a pen and notebook, walking around the kitchen, living room, and her bedroom.  We picked up objects and looked for the names of the companies that produced them. Here’s what we wrote down: *Johnson &amp; Johnson – Lotion *Macys – Couch *Campbell’s Soup – Can of soup *Colgate Palmolive – Soap *Kellogg’s – Cereal Maytag – Stove Lakeshore – Wooden toys *Sony – Stereo Kenmore – Microwave Viewsonic – Computer monitor *Black &amp; Decker – Coffee maker *Apple – Computer Bic – Lighter Bayer – Vitamins *Hewlett Packard – Printer *Hasbro – toys *CVS – Medicine Morton’s – Salt Kitchen Aid – Stove Emerson – Clock radio Sunbeam Products – Coffee grinder Lands End – Lunchbox *Target – Bag Penguin Publishing – Cookbook Biersdorf – Aquaphor Milton-Bradley – Games *Kimberly Clark – Kleenex Pampers – Diapers *Starbucks – Daddy’s coffee Next, we opened up The Wall Street Journal[4] to the 1,000 largest stocks page, and whittled our list of companies to only those which appeared on this list – a smaller group – which I have identified above with an asterisk before the name. Old-school stock picking – printed page and magic marker I prefer her first stock investment to be made with a large, widely-followed company. Finally, I asked her to choose among the large, public companies, which five she felt most kindly toward, or which she thought made great products. Her List Her list was as follows: Kellogg’s (Rice Krispies are loud, loud, loud!) Apple (Mommy has an iPad and she is nice!) Target (Fun shopping trips with Mommy!) Starbucks (Daddy is an addict and clearly has a problem!) Campbell’s Soup (Big Warhol fan!) The final choice – DRIPs The final choice of which company would get my daughter’s $500 came down to the very particular criteria imposed by Dad. I wanted to teach my daughter a few key pieces of information about stock investing that I did not learn until relatively late in life.  Namely: So, I took the list of five preferred companies and looked up on line to see which ones offered DRIPs. Our search among the five preferred companies It turns out Apple is the least DRIPpy, as their investor relations page says it’s not possible to buy shares directly from the company.  That’s fine, and seems like a perfectly reasonable position for the most valuable stock in the world.  Starbucks, Target, and Campbell’s Soup all offer a version of direct purchases from the company plus dividend reinvestment – in fact all via the same company – called Computer Share, which manages DRIPs programs for a number of companies.  I didn’t love the user interface for Computer Share, and each company specifies different terms: different minimum amounts, different costs to purchase, different costs to sell, and different reinvestment programs.  In my search for simplicity for my daughter, this wasn’t it, although I’m sure it’s a fine solution for many folks. That left Kellogg’s, which helpfully does have a simple direct investment program with reinvestment of dividends.  The Nitty Gritty Details My daughter, admittedly, lost a bit of interest as I surfed the Interwebs reading about different programs for direct stock purchases.  After looking over my shoulder for about three minutes, she disappeared for the next 30 minutes.  She was either playing with her American Girl doll or playing Norse Death Metal Groupie.  I’m not sure which.  Daddy was busy. “Aha!  I found it!  Kellogg’s allows us to invest directly and have automatic reinvestment of dividends, and they have a $500 minimum.  So we’re good.  So is Kellogg’s ok?” “Um, ok Daddy, if you say so.” “See?  Isn’t this exciting?  I’m excited.” With her blessing I then took ten minutes online to open up the Custodian Account for a Minor, which involved my social security number, and inputting the bank account from which $500 would be drawn. With that task completed, I returned to telling her a few things about investing in Kellogg’s stock. First lessons in stock ownership We looked briefly at the Google Finance page for the company, and I showed her how the price changes over time.  I showed her on that page also that every quarter owners of the stock receive money in the form of dividends.  Her dividends would buy more shares over time.  I told her that the total investment value of a company is the number of shares multiplied by the price of shares.  I showed her in a spreadsheet how $500 would buy about eight shares, with the stock price around $60/share. I told her that her $500 could lose value, but that more often than not, in the long run, it will increase in value. What I’m not trying to do with this investment I’m excited about this project – admittedly about eight times more excited than my daughter – but still this was a wonderful, awful, idea of mine.  But I know that my idea does not teach everything my daughter should know about stock investments. We had nearly zero discussion about the relative money-making prospects of her first stock purchase.  We barely talked about the attractiveness of Kellogg versus other companies – other than the fact that Rice Krispies is a very loud cereal (a big plus in the 8-year-old world) and other companies do not make Rice Krispies.  Ultimately, greed can be an important motivator for stock investing, but I decided to downplay that for now. I’ve told my daughter nothing about value investing vs. growth investing.  I’ve told her nothing about modeling future cash flows to identify the value underpinning her business ownership.  We know nothing about the management of Kellogg’s – for all I know Dennis Rodman is the new Chairman of the Board.  Dennis Rodman and new BFF Kim Jong Un. We didn’t read the latest annual report (although I downloaded it).  I have not exhaustively read the business news on Kellogg’s to help identify with her the known risks and opportunities of the company.  I’ve told my daughter nothing about properly diversifying a stock portfolio.  I realize we’ve concentrated 100% of her equity portfolio in a single company, something I would never advocate for an adult.[6]  I’ve shown her, but de-emphasized, the importance of the historical price chart for the company, because it’s frankly not as useful as it appears.  I have not reviewed with her the freaky Black Swan events that can take a perfectly healthy-seeming company with a long history and destroy it quickly, in the process dis-Apparating[7] her $500. What I am trying to do with this investment Despite not covering everything, I feel good about four lessons which I have started to teach my daughter. 1. Our relationship to big business and the economy – We buy and use things, every day, made by big public companies.  Those companies aren’t monsters.  And they’re not the boss of us.  If we have savings, we can be the boss of them.[8] 2. Math helps in the real world – Multiplication (a key 8-year-old skill to master) has a practical use in the real world, as do spreadsheets.  The total market value of her investment at any time can be calculated by multiplying the share price by the number of shares she owns. 3. Investing money over time is possible, and important. We can pick which investments to make from a wide variety of choices.  It’s possible – although of course not guaranteed – that we can grow money through stock ownership, both when the companies pay dividends as well as when the share price goes up.  In the long run, a variety of stock investments could make her money grow.  In the short run, and in plenty of cases, she could lose money.  4. When possible, try for as little startup cost as possible. She can start investing her savings in public shares for as little as $500. She does not need a brokerage company in order to invest in companies, but rather can invest in the companies directly, for about $15 in total cost. She can set up a system to have regular dividends reinvested in those companies. For now, that’s enough  By the time she decides to sell – maybe that will be age 18 when she goes to college and needs spending money, or maybe age 19 when we enroll her in the convent to avoid the Norse Death Metal Singer – I expect we will have covered a few more investment lessons. Disclosure statement: Other than the $500 Kellogg’s investment described here I have no direct investments in any of these companies mentioned, nor in any death metal bands, Norse or otherwise. Hey Norse Metal dudes: Stay away from my daughter!   [1] Note: These last two are still in the distant future.  My oldest daughter is only 8, thank the Good Lord. [2] Note: That hasn’t happened yet either, because again, she’s 8.  But I get weepy just thinking about what joy that milestone will bring to our family. [3] Long story, short: She had a few premium hole cards early and a couple of good flops.  Admittedly, also there was a little bit of crying when the pressure mounted. [4] Yes, Daddy is a super-duper dinosaur.  I read The Wall Street Journal, print version, every day.  In this case though, I think the print version helped because we could physically hunt the page with our magic marker for the names of companies we’d found around the house.  So, if your investment strategy involves a magic marker, I recommend a long-standing commitment to print journalism. [5] Traditionally a bigger risk for bonds – the idea that you can’t invest your investment income at the same expected return as your initial investment – but still an issue for dividend stocks. [6] If she were an adult, and she had $5,000 for example, I would insist she buy some low-cost diversified mutual fund, because that’s all most people ever need to do to get wealthy. [7] She’s a Harry Potter fan, so she could relate to this description of her money. [8] But listen, kid, don’t get any ideas about being the boss of Daddy, because only Daddy is the boss of Daddy.  Doubts about this point are already a looming problem in the household. - See more at: http://www.bankers-anonymous.com/blog/daughters-first-stock-market-investment/#sthash.pwukk129.dpuf

It also said it only shipped 3.7 million smartphones last quarter, which is dismally low. The company pre-announced earnings, saying it had a net operating loss of $995 million in Q2 this year. BlackBerry says it will cut operating expenditures by 50% by 2015. BlackBerry shares tanked and closed down 17%. The company is also planning to refocus on enterprise customers instead of normal consumers. BlackBerry is cutting its smartphone lineup from six models to four models. Finally, the company said it still has a special committee looking at options for the business, including a sale. Here's the full press release: BlackBerry Limited, a world leader in the mobile communications market, today announced certain preliminary financial results for the three months ended August 31, 2013 and provided an update on business operations.Preliminary Second Quarter Fiscal 2014 ResultsThe Company currently expects to report revenue for the second quarter of approximately $1.6 billion, of which approximately 50% is expected to be service revenue. For the second quarter, the Company expects to recognize hardware revenue on approximately 3.7 million BlackBerry smartphones. Most of the units recognized are BlackBerry 7 devices, in part because certain BlackBerry 10 devices that were shipped in the quarter will not be recognized until those devices are sold through to end customers. During the second quarter, approximately 5.9 million BlackBerry smartphones were sold through to end customers, which included shipments made prior to the second quarter and which reduced the Company's inventory in channel.As a consequence of the more intense competition the Company is experiencing in its hardware business, it expects to report a primarily non-cash, pre-tax charge against inventory and supply commitments in the second quarter of approximately $930 million to $960 million, which is primarily attributable to BlackBerry Z10 devices.The current quarter will also include a pre-tax restructuring charge in the approximate amount of $72 million reflecting ongoing cost efficiency initiatives.As previously disclosed, the Company anticipated generating an operating loss in the second quarter. The Company currently expects that its adjusted net loss, before giving effect to the inventory and restructuring provisions referred to above, will be in a range of approximately $250 million to $265 million, or $0.47 to $0.51 per diluted share. Including the inventory and restructuring provisions, the GAAP net loss is expected to be approximately $950 million to $995 million, or $1.81 to $1.90 per share. Adjusted gross margin is expected to be approximately 35-37 percent.At the end of the second quarter, total cash, cash equivalents and investments is estimated to be approximately $2.6 billion. The Company has no debt.The preliminary, unaudited information provided above is based on the Company's current estimate of results from operations for the second quarter of Fiscal 2014 and remains subject to change based on the Company's ongoing review of results, the subsequent occurrence or identification of events prior to closing of the review and any further adjustments made in connection with closing and review procedures. All figures in this release are in U.S. dollars and U.S. GAAP, except where otherwise indicated.Operational Restructuring Designed to Enhance Financial ResultsAs part of the Company's focus on enhancing its financial results, and in response to the increasing competition in the smartphone market, BlackBerry also announced plans to transition its future smartphone portfolio from six devices to four. The portfolio will focus on enterprise and prosumer-centric targeted devices, including 2 high-end devices and 2 entry-level devices in all-touch and QWERTY models. With the launch of the BlackBerry Z30 - the next generation high-tier smartphone built on the BlackBerry 10 platform -- this week, the Company will re-tier the BlackBerry Z10 smartphone to make it available to a broader, entry-level audience. At the same time, the Special Committee of the Company's Board of Directors continues to evaluate all strategic alternatives for the Company.Furthermore, the Company also announced that it is targeting an approximate 50% reduction in operating expenditures by the end of the first quarter of Fiscal 2015. As part of this, BlackBerry will implement a workforce reduction of approximately 4,500 positions or approximately 40% of the Company's global workforce resulting in a total workforce of approximately 7,000 full-time global employees.Thorsten Heins, President and Chief Executive Officer of BlackBerry said, "We are implementing the difficult, but necessary operational changes announced today to address our position in a maturing and more competitive industry, and to drive the company toward profitability. Going forward, we plan to refocus our offering on our end-to-end solution of hardware, software and services for enterprises and the productive, professional end user. This puts us squarely on target with the customers that helped build BlackBerry into the leading brand today for enterprise security, manageability and reliability."The Company continues to see increasing penetration of BES 10 with more than 25,000 commercial and test servers installed to date, compared to 19,000 in July 2013."Our enterprise business continues to reflect the trust that governments and businesses have placed in the BlackBerry platform," added Heins. "Security matters and enterprises know the gold standard in enterprise mobility is BlackBerry."
East Hampton Town Police DepartmentJason Lee, the 37-year-old Goldman Sachs managing director facing rape charges in East Hampton, was arraigned in Suffolk County Criminal Court today.   Lee, who was arrested last month, posted $100,000 bail,  East Hampton Patch's Taylor Vecsey reports. According to Patch.com, Lee's attorney Edward Burke, Jr. told reporters outside of court that his client didn't rape the 20-year-old woman visiting the United States from Ireland.  He says the sex was consensual, the report said.   The alleged assault happened at Lee's summer rental home on Clover Leaf Lane the last month, according to a press release from East Hampton Police. Lee and his friends were out celebrating his birthday at Hampton's hot spot Georgica when he met the 20-year-old Irish woman and her friends, Patch.com reports citing Suffolk County District Attorney Thomas Spota. According to Spota, Lee invited the woman and her friends back to his place at 4 a.m.  The 20-year-old told police she was going to the bathroom when Lee allegedly forced his way in and raped her, according to Patch. Police were responding to a disturbance early in the morning involving a car that was believed to be stolen when they learned about the alleged assault on the 20-year-old woman. When authorities showed up, Lee was allegedly hiding in his Range Rover. Lee is married and resides in New York's Tribeca neighborhood. Goldman has placed Lee on leave.

In the week ended September 18, we saw the biggest push into stock market mutual funds and ETFs on record. Investors poured $25.9 billion into global equity funds in the past week, "driven by massive ETF inflows to SPY, IWM, EEM, GDX," says BofA Merrill Lynch chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett, who describes the inflows as "big pre-FOMC short-covering." Meanwhile, bond funds continued to see outflows — to the tune of $1.1 billion this week. Below is a complete breakdown of this week's fund flows, via Hartnett: Asset Class Flows Equities: record $25.9bn inflows ($24bn via ETF's - SPY, IWM, EEM, GDX) Bonds: $1.1bn outflows (8 straight weeks) Commodities: $0.2bn outflows (ends 4 straight weeks of inflows) Equity Flows EM: $1.5bn inflows; note big inflows to Korea ($0.6bn) and GEM funds ($1.0bn).

Steve Kovach/Business InsiderThe iPhone 5C ... cheap plastic crap?For the last six months, Apple observers have expended a lot of words and emotions on the fact that one of Apple's new iPhones was going to be made out of plastic. Apple zealots, after all, have been bashing all other smartphone makers for years for making phones out of "cheap plastic crap." So the Apple-zealot baiters — the folks who regard Apple zealots as mildly amusing, mindless, religious fanatics — have had some fun wondering aloud what the zealots were going to say when Apple launched a phone made of plastic. And they've also had fun pointing out that, only a few short years ago, the Apple zealots fawned all over the iPhone, iPhone 3G, and iPhone 3GS, which were also made of plastic. Well, now Apple has launched the phone made of plastic — the iPhone 5C. So the war of words between the Apple zealots and the Apple zealot baiters can now be settled once and for all. Is Apple in fact now making phones out of "cheap plastic crap?" Or did Apple somehow pull off a miracle in which it is making phones out of plastic that don't feel like they are made of plastic? Well, I just held the iPhone 5C for the first time. So I know the answer. And the answer is ... The plastic in the iPhone 5C doesn't look or feel like plastic. And it certainly doesn't feel like "cheap plastic crap." The plastic in the iPhone 5C looks and feels like 1) painted ceramic, and/or 2) painted metal. Basically, it looks and feels like a super-high-quality, space-age material — the kind of quality of material Apple has been making phones out of for the last couple of years, ever since it stopped making them out of cheap plastic crap. So, worry not, Apple zealots. And ridicule not, Apple zealot baiters. The iPhone 5C feels like a super phone. Yes, it's way too expensive. But, now that Apple has forked the iPhone line into premium (5S) and plastic (5C), Apple has greater pricing flexibility. And I have heard that Apple isn't all that serious about holding the line on the plastic phone's price. So, if and when Apple cuts the price of its plastic phone to, say, $250 in emerging markets, it will sell bazillions of them.

APAt the urging of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), House Republicans voted overwhelminglyÂ Friday for a bill that funds the government while de-funding Obamacare. Now, Cruz is urging his colleagues to filibuster the House bill as soon as it reaches the Senate. It makes a little more sense than it sounds like. Cruz argued that a filibuster is necessary to keep Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) from using what he called "procedural gimmicks" to strip language defunding the Affordable Care Act.Â  "If Reid pursues this plan â€” if he insists on using a 50-vote threshold to fund Obamacare with a partisan vote of only Democrats â€” then I hope that every Senate Republican will stand together and oppose cloture on the bill in order to keep the House bill intact and not let Harry Reid add Obamacare funding back in," Cruz said in a statement. "Now is a time for party unity; Senate Republicans should stand side-by-side with courageous House Republicans." Cruz's statement will put pressure on moderate Republicans â€” and the 14 Republicans who have gone on-record as opposing his strategy â€” to stand with him.Â  But the statement also reflects how difficult it will be to actually carry out his plan in the Senate. HeÂ acknowledged on WednesdayÂ that Reid will likely succeed in stripping the Obamacare defunding langauge from the bill. But by saying as much, he infuriated House Republicans who accused him of waving a white flag.Â  The "procedural gimmicks" Cruz objects to are in keeping with normal Senate rules.  According to a Democratic Senate aide, Democrats will introduce anÂ amendment to strip the House language defunding Obamacare after securing 60 votes to limit debate. Because of Senate rules, they can then strip the language by a simple majority vote. Republicans' only opportunity to filibuster will come before the stripping amendment has passed. The irony in this situation is that if Republican senators do filibuster, they would be blocking passage of a bill that still would include the language to strip Obamacare funding.Â It was a scenario Reid seemed keenly aware of when releasing a statement Friday afternoon reacting to the House vote.Â  "Republicans are simply postponing for a few days the inevitable choice they must face: pass a clean bill to fund the government, or force a shutdown," Reid said in the statement. "I am glad to see more and more of my moderate Republican colleagues speaking up against the vocal, irrational minority within their ranks. But only time will tell if common sense will prevail."
It's been two days since the Federal Reserve sent stocks racing higher with the surprise decision to refrain from announcing a reduction in the pace of monthly bond purchases the central bank makes under its quantitative easing program. Now, headed into the weekend, the rally sparked by the Fed and chairman Ben Bernanke is already collapsing. The S&amp;P 500 is down 0.5%, trading at its lowest level of the day near 1713. The chart below shows the big boost from the Fed decision and the subsequent sell-off. Thinkorswim Gold, which received a similar boost from the Fed decision, is selling off hard. Today, it's down 3%, trading at $1328 an ounce. Thinkorswim
MTVLooking back on it now, the years leading up to the Lehman collapse seem like a fever dream. This was the era when: -- Your friend who had majored in English went to work for an investment bank. -- Your parents thought it would be a good idea to buy a second (or third!) home upstate. -- "My Super Sweet 16" came into existence. We wanted to go back to see just how absurd this moment was. So we've scoured American (and a slice of global) culture and society from 2003 to 2008 to find the most absurd examples and reflections of financial excess.  In retrospect, it is now ludicrously clear that we should've seen it all coming...
WikipediaIn at least one Texas bank and one Ohio credit union, 3D video banking is currently undergoing testing, according to TheFinancialBrand.com, a website for bank and credit union marketing executives. Three-dimensional video banking is similar to a consumer video conference with a bank representative – only in this case, the executive looks like a living, breathing person sitting across from you. Thanks to theater surround sound, the representative also sounds as if they're in the same room. And since the consumer is interacting with a real person and not an automated hologram, the experience apparently isn't much different than the real thing. Banking and managing money isn't what it used to be. The 1970s and 1980s brought us the rise of the ATM. Consumers became acquainted with online banking during the 1990s and the first decade of the 2000s. The 2010s are shaping up as the era of mobile banking. That was underscored Sept. 10-11 in New York City when Mitek Systems Inc., a San Diego-based technology company, debuted its Mobile Photo Account Opening product at Finovate, a trade show where banking tech products are often unveiled. The product allows consumers to open a bank account within 60 seconds. If you have your bank's app, you can use your smartphone's camera to take a photo of the front and back of your driver's license, and presto, your new checking, savings or credit card account is open. [See: 7 Hidden Smartphone Expenses.] Here's a look at other financial products and services personal financial experts think we'll be using in the future. Within 10 years. "The economic payments system will begin to 'know us,' either through biometrics, optical sensor or facial recognition," says Joshua Siegel, managing principal of StoneCastle Partners, a New York-based asset management firm that invests in banks. That's already happening to some extent with smartphones – the new iPhone 5S, for example, uses fingerprint scanning to unlock the phone. Meanwhile, some financial services companies, such as Barclays, are testing and using voice recognition programs in customer service calls. (Why? It makes it much more difficult for a thief, who just stole your driver's license, to pose as you over the phone.) So it isn't a leap to believe that within a decade, the public will become accustomed to automated bank tellers and smartphones recognizing consumers by a touch or a glance. And for all the talk about digital currency overtaking cash, ATMs won't be going away anytime soon. Diebold, Inc., a $3 billion software and technology firm in North Canton, Ohio, unveiled an ATM at the 2013 International Consumer Electronics Show that is designed to work with smartphones. You start the transaction from your smartphone, where you're then given a one-time code that you type onto the ATM, and your cash is released. As Diebold points out, there's no more worrying about someone looking over your shoulder as you type in your PIN number – and no possibility of a criminal capturing your debit card information with a skimmer. [See: 10 Dangers of Mobile Banking.] But not all banking changes will be of the gee-whiz-isn't-that-cool variety. "The banking industry will likely undergo significant changes over the next few decades," says Jeff Varisco, vice president of insurance services at American Equity Investment Life Insurance Company, headquartered in West Des Moines, Iowa. He believes that in industrialized nations, there will be more regulation focusing on solvency and the "too big to fail" problem. Will we even notice? Varisco thinks so. "These efforts will cause the industry to move toward consolidation to a handful of large, national and international banking institutions thereby limiting the ability for banks to develop and offer products specific to regional and local needs," he says. Within 20 years. At this point, nobody will use a teller for something as simple as a deposit or withdrawal, says Maclyn Clouse, professor of finance at the University of Denver's Daniels College of Business. "There will be no teller lines at banks, but loan requests and paperwork for the loans will still exist because of all the regulation. Banks may still have some face-to-face activity for investment products," Clouse says, adding that it will probably become as commonplace to do banking through a TV as it is now through a PC, tablet or phone. That said, "The biggest threat to all of these changes is the lack of security. If hackers can access accounts, there will be significant consumer pressure against the technological changes," Clouse says. "Unfortunately, our current evidence suggests that the hackers are one step ahead. They seem to come up with new ways to hack." And you don't have to be Nostradamus to know that by 2033, paper statements, receipts and mail from your bank will probably be close to nonexistent. But we'll still probably get paper money from banks, says Eric Karson, associate professor of marketing at the Villanova School of Business in Villanova, Penn. "There are huge cost savings to be realized with digital currency," Karson says, "but countering all this is consumer resistance to change. The act, not the coin," he adds. But Karson does believe that 20 years from now, paper money and coins may be closer to extinction than ever, in part because the cost of producing currency will continue to climb, and customer resistance is bound to eventually weaken. "As time passes, more and more consumers will be more comfortable with all things digital. Today's kids will grow up. There will be less and less separation between their digital life and their life in general," Karson says. [See: 6 Digital Currencies That Went Bust.] Within 30 years. "People will pay for goods and services by sending wireless signals to sellers through wearable computers. The payments will be authenticated through the DNA signatures of all parties to a transaction," says Peter Cohan, who teaches business strategy at Babson College in Wellesley, Mass., and has his own eponymous management and venture capital firm. And by this point, he believes, "Cash and credit and debit cards will be history." Which could have an interesting ripple effect, Clouse says. "If cash does go away, an interesting question is what happens to what are now illegal activities involving cash; for example, drug deals on the street corner, prostitution, et cetera," he observes. Of course, it's possible that in 2043, some reader may stumble upon this article, look at his or her wallet full of paper dollars or renminbi (China's official currency) and snicker. After all, 34 years ago, in 1979, a task force appointed by President Jimmy Carter suggested the country get rid of paper currency and coins and replace everything with plastic. While that partially did happen, hard currency is still going strong: According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's website, as of July 2013, the currency in circulation totaled about $1.2 trillion.
Last month, people were wondering where hedge fund manager Phil Falcone's wife, Lisa Maria, had disappeared to because she had been noticeably absent from society events ever since the Met Ball in May. TheÂ New York PostÂ reported thatÂ Lisa Maria, who is known for being in the society pages, had been missing board meetings for the New York City Ballet. Phil told the Post that she was focusing on her filmmaking and family. Â He also denied rumors that their marriage was in trouble saying that they weren't even "remotely true," the report said.Â  Well, she's been spotted now.Â  She made a red carpet appearance at the New York City Ballet's opening night gala at Lincoln Center yesterday evening. The film producer, who is known for her wild and eccentric sense of style, wore a silver gown with a butterfly embellished headband. (See images below.) Her husband Phil, who recently agreed to pay the Securities and Exchange Commission $18 million and accept a five year industry ban, was there, too, according to Bloomberg News.Â  Getty Images/ Jamie McCarthy Getty Images/ Jamie McCarthy
APCenturies ago, as we have written, companies used to run their own armies to wage war against nations sitting on precious resources. Today, of course, companies have eliminated their infantry divisions, transferring those units' salaries to their legal departments. But wars themselves are not dead. So it is that BP and the state of Louisiana find themselves locked in virtual combat as the British-based oil giant contests its legal responsibilities for the 2010 Deepwater Horizon blowout. Seemingly not a day goes by that BP does not open up a new front on the bayou. Yesterday,Â it asked for an injunctionÂ against the state's order to remove thousands of stray oil boom anchors left over from the original cleanup. The state says they pose a safety threat to boaters. BP argues the anchors were federally mandated and that a Coast Guard study found thatÂ not leaving them in place posed an environmental hazard. Earlier this week, BPÂ ran a full-page ad in the New York Times heralding the latest findings from an ongoing federal investigation into the corruption in the office of the spill's claims administrator.Â  And last month, Gov. Bobby Jindal, along with one of his deputies, got into a verbal spat with the company, each side accusing the other of grandstanding over the progress of paying out spill claims. The fight over claims is the war's real front line.  And BP makes a decent case it's getting hosed. Former FBI director Louis Freeh, appointed this July to lead an investigation into the claims payments, foundÂ many of the executives and senior attorneys staffing the claims office engaged in "improper" and "unethical" behavior. "The nature and seriousness of this type conduct varied in degree but was pervasive and, at its extreme, may have constituted criminal conduct," he wrote. For instance,Â aÂ senior attorney in the claims office was found to be taking fees from a law firm in exchange for funneling cases to it. Judge Carl Barbier, who is overseeing the multi-billion claims process, says the $7.9 million claimed by the firm charged should now be thrown out.Â  Freeh is not the only one to find misconduct. A 2011 from ProPublica's Kim Barker investigation on "spillionaires" found examples of apparent gouging of the company in the wake of the spill, with localÂ insiders landing lucrative cleanup contracts, then charging BP for expenses: "This parish raped BP," said Wayne Landry, the chairman of the St. Bernard Parish Council, referring to the conduct of its political leadership. "At the end of the day, it really just frustrates me. I'm an elected official. I have guilt by association." BP unsuccessfully tried to halt the claims process entirely while Freeh conducts his investigation, arguing illicit funds could still be getting paid out.Â  It also thinks claims administrator Patrick Juneau is giving an overly generous interpretation of eligibility to file for damages, and it has filed a case with the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals.Â Freeh has found no wrongdoing on Juneau's part.Â  The 5th Circuit is also hearing the company's case that the $9.6 billion class-action settlement establishing the claims fund should be thrown out entirely if the court doesn't decide in favor of the company against Juneau. Bloomberg says the cost of the original settlement has swollen by $2 billion. Juneau is now accusing BP of "slow walking" the claims process. Of course, one must consider the damage to Louisiana economy's and the environmental impact of the Gulf in all this. The multi-billion settlement didn't come out of the blue â€” the spill was, after all, the worst in U.S. history. But for what it's worth, BP's share price has not recovered since the accident: YahooThat the conflict now looks to drag into its fourth year is not unusual.Â Exxon's fight with Alaska over reparations following the 1989 Valdez spillÂ touched three decades. That spill was several orders of magnitude smaller than the Deepwater Horizon discharge (less than ~1 million barrels for the former versus ~5 million for the latter), though itÂ occurred in a much more confined space. This fight may have only just begun.

WikipediaKnow your history, it'll help you recognize what's going on when you're doomed to repeat it. In his daily note, Wall Street's unofficial historian Art Cashin reminds us of what tipped the world into the Panic of 1873 on this day 140 years ago. On September 18th 1873 Jay Cooke and Company â€” a powerful brokerage and the first to communicate to its clients via telegraph â€” fell when it was unable to sell enough railroad bonds to meet other obligations. The NYSE closed two days later. And the exchange had to close, Cashin writes. As the market emerged from the confusion of losing Cooke and Co., it began to understand its dire situation. The panic spread. And as usual, traders could only dance to the music the market was playing. Here's what the end looked like (from Cashin's note): For most of its first century of existence the NYSE was a â€œcall marketâ€. The chairman, or other senior officer, would call out the name of one of the listed issues. Brokers who had an interest in that â€œissueâ€ would arise from their â€œseatsâ€ and begin to bargain with any other brokers arisen from their â€œseatsâ€. When transactions ended in that issue (assuming they were not all buyers), brokers returned to their â€œseatsâ€ and the chairman called the next issue on the roll. When the last issue was called, the session officially ended. There were two sessions each day... So, here they were. Rumors surfaced that, perhaps some other brokers were involved and the first call on the 18th turned soft. The second call turned soggy. Prices were down and with no on-going after market; all you could do (as the banks did) is await the next call. The morning call on the 19th was messy and the afternoon call was just a disaster. Outside, in a heavy rain, crowds gathered on Wall Street to withdraw securities and money from brokers. By the morning of the 20th anyone who was in the phone book (if there had been one at the time) was rumored to have been impacted by the problem. So, naturally the morning call on Saturday the 20th was a disaster. So much so that the Exchange opted to close until the crisis calmed (skipping the P.M. call). Close they did and for a lot more than one "call." But, but perhaps because banks and investors naturally needed some means of evaluating holdings, they reopened about ten days later. However, the rumors would not go away and liquidations and defaults continued. The history books call it the Panic of 1873. And, it put the American economy in a tailspin for years. (Nearly 10,000 businesses failed.) Sound familiar?
Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George was the only FOMC member against the central bank's Wednesday decision to not taper its asset purchase program known as quantitative easing. In a speech this afternoon, George blasted the decision, saying it "created confusion, created a disconnect," according to Bloomberg. George said that reducing QE would have allowed markets to adjust gradually. Most economists had expected the Fed to begin to taper its $85-billion-a-month bond purchase program by at least $10 billion. Markets were already prepared for the adjustment, according to George. In June, Chairman Bernanke communicated the Fed would look to taper if certain economic indicators looked more favorable. George said she has seen "substantial" progress in the U.S. jobs market with "sufficiently positive" data, a view clearly not all on the FOMC share. But by hinting at a taper and then walking it back unexpectedly, the Fed's credibility is at risk, according to George. Bernanke's Fed has made transparency a chief concern, but the central bank needs credibility in order for markets to trust its forward guidance on the future path of short-term interest rates, George noted. Hints without tangible follow through just won't do.
Screenshot via Bloomberg TVAfter the biggest week of stock inflows on record, BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategistÂ Brian Belski has adjusted his shop's year-end price target for the S&amp;P 500 toÂ 1,800 from his previous target of 1,650. The new target implies 5% upside from today's levels around 1,714. "Sometimes bull markets have a mind of their own, and this one is no different," Belski wrote in a note to clients. "Furthermore, lackluster bond market performance, coupled with expansive equity gains, will likely spur renewed fund flows into equities, especially as the calendar flips to 2014. Thus, we believe the S&amp;P 500 could reach a potential peak of 1,900 before the economy catches up."  Belski called the Fed's decision to not taper its asset purchasing program a "game changer." Indeed, after the Fed announced the decision on Wednesday, the stock market immediately shot to new all-time highs. But reality will eventually catch up to to the momentum, says Belski (emphasis added): Frankly, the current rally in stocks has had more to do with liquidity-driven momentum versus fundamentals, and the lack of asset alternatives has only added to market strength. Eventually the Fed will have to alter its stance once the economy shows stronger signs of life. Until that time, fundamental headwinds will be perceived as positives, while underlying macro strength will be momentum daggers and party crashers. Therefore, the more stocks rise, the greater the likelihood of a sharp price reset once the Fed decides to start taking away the punch from the bowl. Nonetheless, our work shows that such monetary policy transitions, while painful initially, have typically benefitted stocks longer term. "Now thatÂ tapering appears to be off the table for the time being, we are inclined to invoke an adage thatÂ we have learned to live by throughout our careers â€“ do not fight the Fed," Belski concludes.
REUTERS/Brian SnyderSt. Louis Fed president James Bullard.James Bullard, president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, said today in an interview with Bloomberg that the Fed shouldn't raise short-term interest rates if inflation is below 1.5%, and that a 1.5% inflation floor would "reassure markets" that have been swept up in turmoil as participants begin to anticipate a tightening of monetary policy. Bullard also said that he would recommend increasing the size of the central bank's quantitative easing program if inflation were to fall below 1%, a scenario he said would have him "pretty concerned." On Wednesday, the Fed shocked markets with its decision to refrain from announcing the first tapering of the pace of monthly bond purchases it makes under its quantitative easing program. A reduction of $10-15 billion in the amount of purchases it makes each month was widely expected on Wall Street and among market participants.  The "inflation floor" Bullard mentioned today is an idea that has been gathering steam in economic and investment circles in recent weeks, and his comments on the subject led Owen Callan, a fixed income dealer at Danske Bank Markets, to quip in a tweet that perhaps we've just seen the introduction of the "Bullard Rule." The Fed currently offers forward guidance on the future path of its main policy rate based on the "Evans Rule," named for Chicago Fed president Charles Evans. The rule, adopted by the Fed at the conclusion of its December 2012 meeting, dictates that the Fed won't consider raising short-term rates "at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored." JPMorgan economist Michael Feroli explained the rationale behind tweaking the Fed's current forward guidance by adding a floor for inflation – e.g., the Bullard Rule – in a recent note to clients, saying that "given the existing 2.5% upper bound on an acceptable inflation outlook, adding a 1.5% lower bound would serve to emphasize the symmetry around the Fed’s longer-run inflation goal." "Stating that the Fed won’t raise rates if the inflation outlook one to two years ahead is below 1.5% wouldn’t really convey much new information: even without such a statement it’s likely that few now believe a reasonable committee would tighten with such an outlook," said Feroli. "Because of this, an inflation lower bound probably wouldn’t face too much resistance in the committee. Indeed, the July minutes' reference to this option mentioned only positives, but no drawbacks. For this reason we see an inflation lower bound as a relatively cheap option to send a modestly dovish message, albeit an option that probably wouldn’t do much to change policy expectations."
Twitter/@GOPLeader The House of Representatives Friday morning passed a spending bill that would keep the government funded past Sept. 30 â€” and would also strip funding for the Affordable Care Act. The bill passed by a 230-189 vote. All but one Republican voted in favor of the bill. All but two Democrats opposed it. Â  The continuing resolution will head to the Democratic-controlled Senate, where Democrats are expected to have enough votes to strip the language that defunds Obamacare from the bill. The government will shut down Oct. 1 if Republicans and Democrats cannot agree on a consensus bill. The vote in the House came after two weeks of House leadership struggling to find a strategy that avoids a government shutdown but also appeases the ultra-conservative wing of the party who want to use the threat of a shutdown as a last-ditch effort to stop Obamacare, the implementation of whose main provisions starts next month. Wednesday, House Speaker John Boehner gave in to the demands of his party's conservative wing and announced that he would bring to the floor a continuing resolution that includes the language defunding Obamacare. The bill keeps the government funded only through Dec. 15.Â  The bill has caused a significant amount of division between House and Senate Republicans this week. Most of House Republicans'Â ire has been directed at Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas),Â who has pushed the House to take up the cause of defunding Obamacare but admitted Wednesday that his gambit was not likely to succeed in the Senate. Friday morning, Rep. Sean Duffy (R-Wis.) said Cruz and other Senate Republicans had "bullied" and "abused" House Republicans into a failed approach. "You should have been on the floor back in the cloak room," Duffy said on MSNBC's "Morning Joe." "There was so much anger, so much frustration. Because, again, we've been abused by these guys for so long. What I see happening now is people coming out and calling them out for the hypocrisy of these big, tough conservatives who know how to fight but will never get in the ring." The one Republican who voted against the bill was Rep. Scott Rigell (Va.), who said Thursday that he would do so because of a desire to return to regular budget order.
Weeks after a glitch at Goldman Sachs caused a bevy of erroneous options trade, the New York Federal Reserve has returned the favor to the firm. The Financial TimesÂ reports that a clerical error at the Fed left Goldman Sachs without any of the three-month Treasury bills it ordered at a government debt auction. According to the report, a computer bug at the New York Fed meant an actual human being had to manuallyÂ record treasury orders. That Treasury official, the FT reports, gave Goldman more six-month bills than it had ordered but none of the three-month bills. From the FT: As a result of the over-allotment of the six-month bills, Goldman went over the 35 per cent Treasury limit that a bidder can acquire in an auction. The Treasury waived that rule while letting the results of the auction stand, and there will likely be no additional remedies for the bank, a person familiar with the matter said. Keep the change, Goldman! The Fed has had four glitch-free debt auctions since the incident. Read the full report at the FTÂ Â»
Gold is having a rough morning. Right now, the metal is down 2.4%, trading right around $1335 an ounce. The metal rose as high as $1375 this week after the Federal Reserve surprised markets with its decision not to begin tapering the pace of bond purchases it makes under its quantitative easing program. Now, it looks like it's headed back down the other way. Meanwhile, silver is even worse. That metal is down 5.8%, trading around $22 an ounce. Yesterday, SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale strategists, who have been bearish on gold all year, updated clients on where they think gold is going next given the Fed's surprise decision: The gold price rallied hard after the FOMC announcement as short tactical gold positions were squeezed out. It is difficult to say whether there are many more weak hands on the short side yet to get squeezed out but we think that most of the short-covering has probably already been done. If so, gold is unlikely to trade above $1400 unless investors are willing put on fresh long positions.  But are investors likely to put on fresh long gold positions at current levels as a result of a delay to Fed tapering? We doubt it because the Fed taper delay doesnâ€™t change the fact that most of the gold fundamentals are, in our view, bearish. The Fed taper delay has at most weakened the bearish case somewhat but not to an extent that it is likely to prevent the gold price from trending lower.  The key bearish gold fundamentals remain in place: The US economy is recovering at pace, US real interest rates have risen and are likely to trend higher as the recovery gains strength, inflation is very subdued, Fed tapering is likely to start before year-end ( see FOMC post-mortem: If not now, when?). This combined with the fact that investors remain very long gold via ETFs suggest to us that investors are likely to remain net sellers despite the Fed taper delay. The opportunity cost of holding gold is rising and with global stock markets trending higher, gold seems rather unattractive at present.  In conclusion, we remain firmly bearish gold despite the surprising Fed taper delay. The delay may slow the down-trend somewhat but we keep our gold forecasts unchanged for now. We forecast the gold price to average $1,225 during Q4 13 and to drop down to about $1,100 during 2014. We recommend investors to use the recent gold rally as a selling opportunity.Â  Goldman Sachs analysts, who are also bearish on the metal, say risks are skewed toward the upside for gold prices going into the end of the year. The chart below shows trading in gold this week. Thinkorswim
Tesla's stock hit a new all-time high of $185.83, before pulling back to $184.40. The stock is up a whopping 441% year-to-date. The stock surged yesterday after Deutsche Bank's Dan Galves raised his price target for Tesla to $200, from $160: "Based on conversations with mgmt and monitoring information available on Tesla ownersâ€™ blogs, we believe that the company is on-track to modestly outperform Q3 margin expectations, that demand has continued to grow in the US and Europe (despite substantial option pricing increases in effect as of late July), and that the production rate at Tesla's factory has continued to increase." Here's a look at how the stock has done over the last five days: Google Finance
Reuters/ Brendan McDermidIconic hedge fund manager Stanley Druckenmiller, the founder of Duquesne Capital Management, has been vocal for the past several months about the issue of generational theft.  Druckenmiller, who accurately called the housing crisis, has said he sees another "storm" coming due to entitlement transfer payments. Entitlements are things like Social Security and Medicare that primary go to older, retired workers. The billionaire fund manager believes that seniors in this country are essentially stealing from the young via these entitlement transfers. What's more is he thinks it could result in a crisis even more devastating than 2008.    Druckenmiller, 60, will be visiting various college campuses this fall to talk about this issue with the younger population. We found a video of his presentation he gave at his alma mater Bowdoin College in Maine a few months ago.    Druckenmiller told the Bowdoin students that he started worrying back in 1994.  "The reason was because...it was demographics because I knew that in 2011 the 'Baby Boomers'...the front end was going to turn 65 and you were going to have this huge surge in entitlement payments because again the biggest buckets of entitlements are for the elderly."  He also shared 16 charts with the students and explained why it's such a pressing matter that should be addressed now. We've included his charts and commentary in the slides that follow. 
Societe GeneraleWeimar Germany after World War One went through one of the worst hyperinflations in history, unleashing untold horrors on the German people and their economy. To this day, "Weimar" is always invoked as the ultimate hyperinflation horror story. Critics of the Federal Reserve's extraordinary attempts to stimulate the economy since the 2008 financial crisis and recession – like the program of large-scale bond purchases known as quantitative easing – have warned that the U.S. central bank's easy-money policies were dangerous and could eventually stoke unwanted inflation. Ever since earlier this year, when the Fed hinted that it could move to begin rolling back quantitative easing soon, inflation premiums have collapsed as real interest rates have soared. Gold, for example – a metal often viewed as an inflation hedge – crashed earlier this year. Adam Fergusson wrote the definitive book on Weimar – a real instance of hyperinflation – titled When Money Dies. It used to be out of print and a bit hard to find, but now you can find it in its entirety online. We summarized the key elements of Fergusson's book.
Peak oil is dead. As we and others have written, the combination of the U.S. shale boom and flagging demand are going to start pushing markets sideways.   We recently got four new charts that elaborate on this phenomenon, which one might call  plateau oil and gas. It's way better than peak oil, we'd argue, because it should leave both consumers and producers slightly satisfied and slightly unsatisfied. First, the EIA says the oil production boom is going to decelerate by about 200,000 barrels a day starting next year. But overall oil production is soon going to hit 12 million barrels a day, and will stay there for awhile. EIA This will help gas prices stay range bound — around $3.50, which has also been the quarterly average since Mach 2011 — for the foreseeable future.  EIA For natgas (oil's brother in fossil fuels), the production deceleration is already under way. But the U.S. is going to be pumping about 70 billion cubic feet of natgas for as far as the eye can see. EIA And consumption will probably never get much higher than 90 billion cubic feet a day (we still import some). EIA We can live with this.
Mark Zuckerberg was in Washington yesterday meeting with politicians like Senator Chuck Schumer, and the little news within the news (at least on Bloomberg) is that he wore a suit. It is a little odd to see Zuckerberg out of his trademark hoodie,  but he has started wearing suits more often, and usually the results are the same — the suits fit a bit awkwardly. We wanted to know how he can step his game up. So Business Insider reached out to some of our friends in the men's fashion world — entrepreneurs/designers Pranav Vora and Philip Soriano at D.C. based retailer Hugh and Crye, and Judah Estreicher of JBD Clothiers. JBD makes custom suits and dresses clients like 49ers tight end Vernon Davis and Ravens Quarterback Joe Flacco. We sent the gentlemen a few pictures of Zuckerberg in a suit — specifically some photos from his wedding and the 2011 G8 Summit in France (pictured above) — and asked them to explain what made his suits fit the way they do. Here we go. First and foremost, Estreicher, Soriano, and Vora all agree that Zuckerberg has been wearing "fused" suits. A high quality suit, Estreicher pointed out, is put together with full canvas, which is horse hair. Fused suits, on the other hand, are glued together and when that happens, the suit can look boxy and unflattering on the body. Also, when fused suits are dry cleaned too many times the glue expands and can corrupt the fit of the garment, making it wrinkly. The guys also see a few issues with the way Zuckerberg's suits fit his body. "Fit of the jacket is also an obvious issue here," said the Vora and Soriano. "His jacket shoulders extend past his actual shoulders and he looks like he's wearing a rental suit from that terrible suit rental place, or borrowing a suit from a football player friend...It almost gives a the look of a kid-in-a-grown-man's-suit look, like that last scene of the movie 'Big.' Shorten those sleeves to your wrist, and show a little shirt cuff." The shoulders aren't the only common problem with Zuckerberg's jackets either. "To make his suit more fitted," Estreicher added. "I would take in the chest, half Girth (stomach)... measurements." Estreicher also said that in a few pictures, the fabric and buttons on Zuckerberg's suits looked cheap. And regardless of what anything costs, you never want something to look cheap. Last of all, it's important to remember that the way you feel in a suit reflects how you look.If you don't wear one a lot — like only on extra special occasions — you'll feel uncomfortable. The more you wear it, though, the more confident you'll feel. So Zuckerberg has that going for him. "These are all easy and accessible changes that Mark Zuckerberg can make to look a little more polished when he does need to dress up a bit," said Vora and Soriano. "He's by all measures an incredible leader and visionary - we'd love to see him dress the part, too." Agreed. No hate, Zuck, we just want to see you look fresh. Check out Zuckerberg hanging out with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi yesterday, suit and all, below:  Great to meet with Mark Zuckerberg, a strong voice in our efforts to pass immigration reform. #timeisnow pic.twitter.com/W1voAXhpWR
en.wikipedia.org Do you work in finance? Are you tall, green-eyed and of above average intelligence? If so, you may want to donate your gametes. You would not be the first. Data from the London Sperm Bank (LSB) reveals that finance workers are some of the most prolific spreaders of their seed. On average, 36 finance professionals visit the bank every month. This puts them on a par with students, and compares to donations from just three chefs and six film makers. Only IT managers are more keen (45 a month, on average). Dr. Kamal Ahuja, managing director of the LSB says finance professionals are frequent visitors to the Bridge Centre near London’s Tower Bridge. Sperm donors aren’t paid in the UK, but the clinic offers £35 ($56) to cover any costs. Ahuja says a lot of the bankers who visit refuse the payment. “They want to donate and to make a gesture – like blood donors. Some of them have seen the effects of infertility and want to help.” Ahuja cites one particular investment banking donor who has made ten separate donations (the maximum allowed under British rules) and has consistently declined to be compensated. “Because of his personal wealth, he doesn’t care for the money. He has helped to create ten families.”

A provocative new paper on American employment is making the rounds today after it was presented at the Brookings Panel on Economic Activity. Economists Olivier Coibion, Yuriy Gorodnichenko and Dmitri Koustas analyze the three most recent U.S. recessions, noting that the unemployment rate has stayed high for longer and longer through time. The trend is reminiscent of 1980s Western European recessions dubbed "Eurosclerosis," leading the authors to ask if the United States is fighting its own bout of "Amerisclerosis." In lay terms, we might call Amerisclerosis the "jobless recovery." The authors discuss how contractionary policies after the ends of recessions as well as shifting American attitudes toward work could have led to persistent unemployment. Ultimately, policymakers and economists need to rethink fiscal and monetary policy so we can prevent static labor markets after recessions, the authors conclude. "If future U.S. downturns are to be more long-lived than pre-1990 recessions, then the nature of fiscal policy responses should likely be revisited," they write. "If ‘timely, targeted and temporary’ remains the mantra of future stimulus measures, then Amerisclerosis may not be so far away." In the chart below, you can the vast difference in employment between pre and post-1990 recessions. Brookings Economist Justin Wolfers explains the paper well: 
Wikimedia CommonsPortfolio construction can be overwhelming and the temptation to chase strategies that 'promise' to beat the market is ever present. But it's important for investors to determine their financial goals and understand just how to go about constructing a portfolio that can help them get to those goals. Here are a few key factors that investors should check-off when speaking to their advisors about their portfolio. What are my financial goals? Many people, with good reason, worry about outliving their savings. Some investors also need to factor in relatives that are less well-off that they might need to help. Investors often keep mum about health concerns in the family or the financial condition of relatives. But this can be a crucial detail for advisors, not only because they can help curb unnecessary spending and keep clients on track to meet their goals, but also because they can step in and tell them just how much they can realistically allocate to relatives without overextending themselves. Another crucial aspect of assessing financial goals is understanding when you might need money. If an investor needs money in the near-term they might have to opt for more liquid assets. This could also subject investments to short-term volatility. What about asset allocation and diversification? Greenhorn investment strategies like age equals asset allocation, where investors use their age to determine the percent of their portfolios to keep in stocks, have been eschewed. Instead, investors should ask their advisors about a whole host of assetsÂ including stocks, both domestic and international, fixed income, real estate, cash, commodities, and alternative investments and determine what percent of their portfolio they want to allocate to their chosen assets. The idea is that each of the assets serves a different purpose. The portfolio could include Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) to protect against inflation. A focus on fixed income could be warranted if investors are concerned with regular income. Typically an investor will load up on stocks if they are chasing higher returns, but this carries a higher risk. The reason advisors recommend diversification is that each of these assets will respond to market moving events differently and help reduce risk. During each of these stages it is important for an investor to keep asking how much risk is right for them and how much they can take on.  Finally, investors should stay flexible and consider rebalancing their portfolio as needed. This isn't to say that every market move warrants a rebalancing, but it is something they should keep an eye on.
All new coal plants will be limited to 1,100Â lbs of carbon dioxide a year, the EPA will announce today according to the New York Times. Right now they release a an average of 1,800 lbs a year. The usual GOP howls of a "war on coal" have already been issued in advance of the formal announcement. But you may be surprised to learn that the coal industry remains as robust as ever, even in the face of natural gas' onslaught. Consider: according to the EIA... And guess what the EIA projects will be America's greatest source of electricity generation by 2040?  Yup, the king: EIA It's not clear whether the EIA took the new standards into consideration when they released their latest projections. But it almost doesn't matter. The proposed regs only apply to new coal plants. And through August, only two of those went online this year. Last year we only built eight. Coal plants represent just one component of the broader industry.  If there's a war on, we're not seeing it in coal mining. Check outÂ payrolls â€” eight out of the last 10 months, and four out of the last five, have seen coal mining jobs growth: BLSAnd even as the administration announces the new rules, it is also expanding its energy loan guarantee program, setting aside as much as $8 billion to research new technologies to help both new plants meet the proposed standards and retrofit old plants to limit their emissions. If there's a mortal threat to coal, it's not from President Obama.Â  Nor is it from natural gas, which indeed has seen robust growth â€”Â 55 new plants using it as a fuel source came online this year. If there's a threat to coal, it's from Americans using less electricity. And that's a threat to all power sources. The EIA saysÂ total U.S. electricity generation will grow by just 0.2% in 2013 and by just 0.4% in 2014. Here's the jobs chart for the electricity industry. It doesn't look good:Â  BLS We've already seen five nuclear plants, including "legendary" ones like Vermont Yankee and San Diego's San Onofre, go down this year. No one is suggesting there's a war on nuclear. We know this administration likes to take a gradual approach to everything. These new regulations are just another instance.
APRep. Sean DuffyRepublican Congressmen are continuing to rail against Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) on the push to defund the Affordable Care Act through the government spending bill.  Thursday night, Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) said Cruz should "keep quiet" about House matters. And on Friday, Rep. Sean Duffy (R-Wis.) continued his blistering criticism of Cruz, complaining that he "abused" and "bullied" House conservatives into a strategy that's going nowhere. "I have to tell you what," Duffy told "Morning Joe's" Joe Scarborough Friday, "You should have been on the floor back in the cloak room. There was so much anger, so much frustration. Because, again, we've been abused by these guys for so long. What I see happening now is people coming out and calling them out for the hypocrisy of these big, tough conservatives who know how to fight but will never get in the ring." House Republicans have been angry — publicly — at Cruz since Wednesday, when he released a statement that Duffy said then was akin to "waving the white flag" and surrendering on Obamacare defunding. Cruz — along with Sens. Mike Lee (R-Utah), Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) have been the leaders of the "defund" scheme that most Republicans agree has no chance of passing the Senate.  With 10 days until a possible government shutdown, Republicans are worried they'll get heaped with the blame for a no-end strategy. The House is voting Friday on its bill to keep the government funded, which includes language to strip funding for Obamacare. It is expected to pass, but the language will be stripped when it heads to the Senate — something Cruz acknowledged, finally, on Wednesday. King told CNN's Wolf Blitzer Thursday that the episode proved Cruz and other Republican senators should stay out of the House's business. He said that Republicans could "not let a government shutdown happen." And he said that if the GOP's image makes it through this "crisis," it would be because of House Speaker John Boehner's leadership. "If anything good comes from all of this, when Ted Cruz and Rand Paul and Mike Lee fail in the Senate next week, maybe finally we Republicans will have ended their influence," King said. "We as House Republicans should stop letting Ted Cruz set our agenda for us," King added. "He should stay in the Senate, keep quiet."  "If he can deliver on this — fine. If he can't, he should keep quiet from now on and we shouldn't listen to him."
Quick market note. US futures just fell a bit. Here's a chart from FinViz of Dow futures: FinViz What happened? St. Louis Fed chief James Bullard just hinted on BloombergTV that an October taper (reduction in the pace of bond purchases) is possible. From Dave Lutz at Stifel, Nicolaus: James Bullard, aÂ  Centrist â€“ is out speaking right now, saying that a October taper is possible â€“ We are seeing Gold, Equities and Bonds getting hit â€“ and the rhetoric today may intensify as we have 2 big hawks scheduled to speak today as well (Details in WTAW) - EEM, Gold, Bonds, equities not very happy right now.Â  Couple that with DC Rhetoric on Food Stamps and Debt votes - and the tape has a few headwinds to deal with. One interesting comment from Bullard is that if they want they can have a press conference after the October meeting, even though that's not scheduled.
paintings / Shutterstock.com Investors are going stock crazy, and they actually put a huge amount of money to work right before the big Fed decision. From Bloomberg: Global equity funds attracted the largest inflows since at least 2005 in the week ended Sept. 18 as investors piled into stocks before the Federal Reserveâ€™s decision to maintain monetary stimulus. The funds lured a net $25.9 billion in the period, Wei Liang Chang, a foreign-exchange strategist at Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ), said by phone from Singapore today, citing data from EPFR Global. The flows were quite lopsided. Virtually all of the money went to developed market funds. That being said, with the Fed decision, keeping the ultra-easy money going, it's plausible that the money will start flowing back out to emerging markets again.
The world is still digesting this week's big news, that the Fed decided to keep up the pace of its monthly bond buying program known as QE, rather than slowing it down (tapering) which is what many had expected. Prior to Wednesday, the thinking was that the Fed would slow the pace of QE, not because the economy was so hot, but because QE itself was proving to be less and less effective as an economic stimulant. Matthew Boesler wrote a piece earlier this week laying out various non-data reasons why the Fed would give up on QE. So why did the Fed keep the program? And if QE doesn't do anything, then why did markets react so violently (a move most clearly seen in rate markets). This chart from Morgan Stanley really gets at the answer. It shows the expected path of the Fed Funds rate based on Fed Funds futures. The blue line shows the market-expected path of the Fed Funds rate pre-Fed meeting. The green line is immediately after the Fed bombshell. The implication is clear. By delaying the onset of tapering, the market also assumes that the eventual actual rate hike will be delayed as well. QE is a form of signaling. As long as you're doing QE, you're signaling that the eventual first rate hike is a long way off. Talking about ending QE signals that the first rate hike comes sooner.Morgan Stanley Â  This is a point also made nicely by Ryan Avent in The Economist today: When taper talk ramped up in May and June and markets swung on the news, they weren't reacting solely to expected changes in the Fed's balance sheet, but to what the Fed was signalling about its views on the appropriate pace of recovery for the economy. Now as it turned out markets over-interpreted the Fed's talk. And so the Fed found itself needing to adjust market perceptions. The no-taper call was one aspect of that. So were remarks about the importance of the 7% threshold for ending QE (virtually none, it now seems) and the 6.5% threshold for raising interest rates (almost none, so long as inflation doesn't stray too far above target). So, for that matter, were comments about the labour-force participation rate. More than the asset purchases themselves, the signal of continuing with asset purchases is a powerful message that low interest rates will continue for a long time.
REUTERS/ Toru HanaiApple store staff pose with the new Apple iPhone 5S before its goes on sale at an Apple Store at Tokyo's Ginza shopping district September 20, 2013.Good morning. Here's what you need to know. Â 
(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp Chief Executive Steve Ballmer has made an impassioned plea to investors to support his vision of the world's largest software company as a unified devices and services powerhouse in his swan song before Wall Street. Ballmer, who in August said he planned to step down within 12 months, told investors and analysts in an annual meeting on Thursday that Microsoft had a bright future, despite missteps under his 13-year tenure. "We have the tools. There's economic upside here. In the long run, we are almost uniquely poised to seize the opportunity," he said, in a typically high-volume presentation. "Today I'm speaking as an investor. You all ownÂ Microsoft stock, cheer for it, for God's sake." Ballmer, who took over from co-founder Bill Gates as CEO in 2000, did acknowledge that under his leadership the company was too focused on Windows to realize that Apple Inc's iPhone was revolutionizing computing. "If there's one thing I regret, there was a period in the early 2000s when we were so focused on what we had to do around Windows that we weren't able to redeploy talent to the new device form factor called the phone," saidÂ Ballmer. After losing ground to Apple and Google Inc in mobile and internet arenas for the last 10 years, Ballmer in July launched an ambitious reorganization focused on "devices and services." He announced his retirement only six weeks later amid pressure from some discontented shareholders. Ballmer said the top layers of that reorganization had taken effect, but the new functionally organized groups were at different stages in working out exactly how they will be structured. The company had no comments on the progress of the board's search for a new CEO. "It really was a fundamental shift from running a set of separate business units where we tried to make connection points to running a company that is essentially one integrated entity," said Ballmer, attempting to explain his vision. During four hours of presentations, which were interrupted for about half an hour due to a power cut, MicrosoftÂ executives expanded on Ballmer's idea, explaining how the company would continue its push into making its own hardware - following the deal to buy phone maker Nokia - and would stress services rather than products, while keeping individual consumers in mind rather than chiefly concentrating on businesses. Qi Lu, the executive in charge of applications and services, hinted that Microsoft's popular Office suite of applications would at some point be available on the iPad, a market that one analyst put at $2.5 billion a year. He said Microsoft was currently working on "touch first" versions - as opposed to traditional keyboard and mouse versions - of core Office applications such as Outlook, Word and Excel which would at some point feature on devices running Windows, and would be available on other platforms when they were ready and "financially sensible." Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood explained that Microsoft would start reporting quarterly financial data in five new blocks based around themes rather than products such as Windows or Office. Hood said the new reporting structure - which essentially separates consumer and commercial business, and then divides revenue streams between hardware and software licensing - would begin at its next earnings in October, and was aimed at giving more insight into the company's economic approach. Ballmer closed the presentations, in Bellevue, Washington, on an optimistic note as he prepared to transition from CEO to an interested bystander who owns 4 percent of the company. "The company needs to produce every day. We've got a little headwind but we've got plenty of upside," he said. "The ultimate measure of a place has got to be what happens with profits. As a shareholder I will hold us accountable for continuing to focus in on good short-term results and at the same time making investments that give us an opportunity to generate someday another $10, $15, $20, $25 billion of incremental profit."

Wikimedia CommonsThe economy is doing okay. The Fed isn't going to end the party soon. Europe is recovering. China is doing fine. The emerging market carnage is contained for now. So what's the one thing left to worry about? From Dan Greenhaus (@danBTIG), at BTIG: The answer to that question is of course the debt ceiling. To be sure, when we discussed the debt ceiling back in 2011, many investors said they canâ€™t control such an outcome so they have to plow ahead, letting the chips fall where they may. Those chips did fall..down nearly 20%. The same sort of rationale is being applied today, at least in our conversations. We agree; the typical investor should take no heed of these matters. However when the question is â€œwhat can stop this train,â€ the answer these days is usually â€œdopes in Washington.â€ That being said, although "Washington" is the obvious answer of what to worry about, it's not clear that anyone actually is worrying. The market is showing zero signs of stress at this point about any of this, even though the reports from DC are all about growing odds of some kind of error. In Ben White's Morning Money, he quotes analysts at Citi to explain the ennui: CITI NOT TOO WORRED ABOUT DC DISASTER â€“ Per Citigroupâ€™s Tina Fordham and Matt Dabrowski: â€œIn our view the likelihood of a government shutdown or a technical default, while not negligible, remains low due to the political risks for respective parties as 2014 midterm elections loom ... We remain cognizant of the significant tail risks that come from a failure to find agreement. For the next three weeks, the key signpost to watch for is a change in rhetoric: public statements from Boehner or Obama committing to a shutdown or a debt default, which would represent a change from their current positions... Such a commitment from Boehner or Obama would raise the risk temperature significantly, since it would signal that a shutdown is imminent.â€ This is characteristically simple analysis of DC from Wall street (nobody is coing to "commit" to a debt default or anything like that). It seems basically that having been through this in 2011 and early 2013, everyone is convinced that there's just nothing to get exercised about. Hope that's right.
Rail traffic showed more signs of positive economic growth this week as intermodal traffic rose 4.9% compared with the same week last year. Â Total traffic was up 3.1% and the 12 week moving average in intermodal rose to 3%. Â Thatâ€™s the highest reading since May of this year. Â The AAR has some more details: â€œThe Association of American Railroads (AAR) reported increased weekly rail traffic for the week ending September 14, 2013 with total U.S. weekly carloads of 296,221 carloads, up 1.5 percent compared with the same week last year. Intermodal volume for the week totaled 265,873 units, up 4.9 percent compared with the same week last year.

FlickrMarkets went wild on Wednesday after the Fed decided to hold pat on the pace of its bond purchases, opting not to "taper" the pace of Quantitative Easing. But that's calmed down. So what's next? SocGen currency strategist Kit Juckes writes:  Treasuries and equities stalled yesterday and the dollar found its feet. The first phase of the no-taper rally has passed. The next phase is that we will see huge inflows into EM assets as investors take advantage of better yields and less expensive currencies. With global growth slowing, and with capital flows likely to be more volatile in a less certain policy environment, I don't know how far an EM bounce can go, but Benoit Anne has conceded that the bear market is over and the risk is that EM is where the sugar rush rally is most keenly felt. I like MXN (along with CAD) vs. the US dollar. As for those Mongolian 10yr dollar bonds - well the spread to Treasuries is still almost 1% wider than when they were launched.
India's new central bank governor marked his first policy meeting Friday with a bold decision to hike interest rates, wrong-footing analysts and leading to sharp falls on the stock market. Reserve Bank of India (RBI) chief Raghuram Rajan, who had warned he was prepared to be unpopular, ordered a rise in the benchmark interest rate from 7.25 to 7.50 percent at a mid-quarter policy review in India's financial centre Mumbai. The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensex index fell 2.55 percent or 526.71 points afterwards to 20,119.93 points and the rupee fell to 62.41 against the dollar from its previous close of 61.77. "Bringing down inflation to more tolerable levels warrants raising the repo rate by 25 basis points immediately," Rajan said in a statement. Rajan had been widely forecast by economists to keep rates on hold despite annual inflation hitting an unexpected six-month high of 6.1 percent this week. While businesses and the government would like a rate cut to help revive sluggish growth, this would risk pushing inflation higher and further weakening the rupee, which hit record lows in the weeks before Rajan took charge on September 4. Rajan did however relax some exceptional liquidity tightening measures that had been introduced by the RBI in July to try and help stem the rupee's freefall. The "daily CRR", the amount banks must deposit with the central bank, was reduced from 99 to 95 percent, while the marginal standing facility -- used to lend to commercial banks when there is a shortage of funds in the market -- was cut by 75 basis points. "Now things are back to normal, he is using the policy rate to target inflation and that will allow the rupee to do what it likes," Daniel Martin, Asia Economist at Capital Economics, told AFP. Nicknamed "The Guv", Rajan stepped up to the post faced with the unenviable task of propping up a weak rupee, reviving slowing economic growth and curbing rising inflation. "Wholesale Price Index inflation will be higher than initially projected over the rest of the year," he said in Friday's statement. "What is equally worrisome is that inflation at the retail level... has been high for a number of years, entrenching inflation expectations at elevated levels and eroding consumer and business confidence." Huge expectations have been riding on the former International Monetary Fund chief economist who famously predicted the 2008 global financial crisis years in advance. He has been lionised by India's media, and one top columnist has dubbed him the "Poster Boy of Banking" whose "chiselled features are as sharp as his brain". But on his first day in office, Rajan said he may have to take unpopular steps to tackle what some economists have called India's worst economic crisis in decades. He almost immediately announced a string of measures to liberalise financial markets and support the currency. His efforts to swell foreign exchange coffers have helped the rupee bounce back, reaching around 62 against the dollar, from 67 when he took charge. Easing global concerns over the US Federal Reserve's stimulus plan, attacks on Syria and rising oil prices have also aided the rupee's recovery. The Indian economy has gone dramatically downhill since the "Indian Summer" of the last decade, when annual growth rates regularly topped eight and nine percent. It grew by five percent last year, its slowest pace in a decade, and some private economists forecast expansion this year at under four percent. Meanwhile, the Congress-led government has become mired in graft scandals and policy paralysis that have sunk its popularity and sent foreign investors fleeing. India's public finances are also in trouble with the current account deficit -- the broadest measure of trade -- hitting a record high last year. Copyright (2013) AFP. All rights reserved. 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” The Obama administration is pressing ahead with tough requirements for new coal-fired power plants, moving to impose for the first time strict limits on the pollution blamed for global warming. The proposal would help reshape where Americans get electricity, away from a coal-dependent past into a future fired by cleaner sources of energy. It's also a key step in President Barack Obama's global warming plans, because it would help end what he called "the limitless dumping of carbon pollution" from power plants. Although the proposed rule won't immediately affect plants already operating, it eventually would force the government to limit emissions from the existing power plant fleet, which accounts for a third of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Obama has given the Environmental Protection Agency until next summer to propose those regulations. The EPA provided The Associated Press with details of the proposal prior to the official announcement, which was expected Friday morning. The public will have a chance to comment on the rule before it becomes final. Despite some tweaks, the rule packs the same punch as one announced last year, which was widely criticized by industry and Republicans as effectively banning any new coal projects in the U.S. That's because to meet the standard, new coal-fired power plants would need to install expensive technology to capture carbon dioxide and bury it underground. No coal-fired power plant has done that yet, in large part because of the cost. And those plants that the EPA points to as potential models, such as a coal plant being built in Kemper County, Miss., by Southern Co., have received hundreds of millions of dollars in federal grants and tax credits. Coal, which is already struggling to compete with cheap natural gas, accounts for 40 percent of U.S. electricity, a share that was already shrinking. And natural gas would need no additional pollution controls to comply. "For power producers and coal mining companies that reject these standards, they have no reason to complain, and every excuse to innovate," said Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., the author of a 2009 bill to limit global warming. The legislation, backed by the White House, passed the House, but died in the Senate. A powerful Republican opponent of the EPA plan, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said in an emailed statement that "the president is leading a war on coal." The regulations have been in the works since 2011 and stem from a 1970 law passed by Congress to control air pollution. In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled that that law, the Clean Air Act, could be applied to heat-trapping pollution. The EPA already has issued rules aimed at curbing global warming pollution from automobiles and the largest industrial sources. An EPA official told the AP that the rule doesn't specify any particular technology. But the official acknowledged that carbon capture was the only current technology available for a company to meet the threshold of 1,100 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions per megawatt hour of electricity. To put that in perspective, a modern coal plant without carbon controls would release about 1,800 pounds per megawatt hour. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the announcement of the rule had not been made. The administration went back to the drawing board after receiving more than 2 million comments on its first proposal, which was legally vulnerable because it required coal and natural gas to meet the same limit. Coal and natural gas now have separate standards, but the latest proposal will almost certainly to be litigated once it becomes final, which the law requires the EPA to do in a year. The legal argument likely will be based around whether carbon capture and storage is a demonstrated technology. "EPA has set a dangerous and far-reaching precedent for the broader economy by failing to base environmental standards on reliable technology," said Hall Quinn, president and CEO of the National Mining Association. The EPA regulation "effectively bans coal from America's power portfolio," he said. The EPA will seek comments on whether to subject three coal plants in various stages of the development to the new standard, or treat them as existing sources. They are the Sunflower Electric Power Corp.'s facility near Holcomb, Kan., Power4Georgian's planned Washington County, Ga., facility, and Wolverine Power Cooperative's plans for a new power plant near Rogers City, Mich. ___ Follow Dina Cappiello on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/dinacappiello Copyright (2013) Associated Press.

Flickr / Mick_tnMarkets have really calmed down after the excitement from Wednesday, when everything boomed after the Fed decided to hold pat on asset purchases. Basically nothing is happening. The big exception right now is that the Indian central bank unexpected hiked rates overnight in a bid to fight inflation and lift its currency, and that sent the Indian stock market (the SENSEX) tanking. Other than that, mostly tumbleweed.
