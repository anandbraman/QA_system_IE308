BloombergEllen ZentnerAccording to the consensus estimate, the U.S. added 140,000 nonfarm payrolls in April. This number is derived from a survey of Wall Street economists conducted by Bloomberg. The range of estimates goes as low as 100,000 and as high as 200,000. At the bearish end is Nomura economist Ellen Zentner.† From her jobs preview note: When the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) releases the National Employment Report on Friday we expect it to reveal that the US economy added a net new 100k jobs in April... Our below consensus forecast for total nonfarm payrolls reflects our judgment that most incoming labor market indicators failed to improve in April following a surprisingly softer labor market in March (when the BLS reported that just 88k net new jobs were created)....Not all labor market indicators have weakened, but on net incoming data since the March employment report have continued to soften (Figure 2). Nomura The regional surveys, consumer spending data, consumer confidence readings, and Nomura's proprietary indicators on net point to weakness. Zentner's forecast is even lower than the bearish "whisper number." It's worth noting that in December, Zentner had an unusually bullish forecast for the jobs report and she basically nailed it.

You Should Bet The Overall Market, Not Its Biggest Company†(John Del Vecchio) A fascinating chart from John Del Vecchio: how the largest company, by market cap, performed during their time ranked No. 1, versus overall market performance. As you can see, the market wins in a landslide: John Del Vecchio † Gold Isn't Looking Too Good†(Bloomberg) † Gold prices will close the year at $1,550 an ounce, according to a Bloomberg survey. That's†7.5% less than at the end of 2012 and the biggest drop since 1997.†"Itís the end of an era,î Soc Gen's Michael Haigh, who correctly predicted the collapse a month ago, told Bloomberg. ìETF flows and hedge fund flows have gold changing direction for the first time in a long, long time.

LinkedIn/Ritholz Bears Cannot Convince A Pullback Is Imminent†(Price Action Lab) Sure, things have gotten a bit choppy, PAL's Michael Harris writes, and bears may try to convince us that a pullback is imminent. They will be wrong, based on this chart, he says. Price Action Lab Harris: "The technical picture is pretty clear from the above chart and any bear who†tries to rationalize otherwise is experiencing cognitive dissonance.††Stock market bears who see that the market is†on a strong uptrend since the beginning of this year try to rationalize their†position by blaming the FED, QE and†claiming that the market is manipulated. This is a terrible psychological state of†cognitive dissonance, similar to what a smoker experiences when he knows that smoking kills but tries to rationalize his decision to buy cigarettes by denying the validity of the studies that show a high death rate amongst smokers." Italy's Equity Market Turning A Corner (David Kotok) The storm in Italy appears to have abated, at least for now, after the election of a new coalition government led by anti-austerity candidate Enrico Letta, David Kotok says. Italian equities rallied big in April:†EWI, the Italian stock ETF improved 13.07% for the month, 3x the 3.57% gain in the main Germany ETF. The iShares MSCI EMU Index ETF, EZU, which covers the Eurozone markets, advanced by 6.34%. There's more. Kotok: "The bond market welcomed political developments in Italy, permitting the country to auction 3 billion euros of 5-year bonds at 2.84% and 3 billion euros of 10-year bonds at 3.94%, the lowest auction yields for such bonds since October 2010.† Another indication of the improvements in the marketís attitude towards Italy is the increase in Italyís bank deposits in March. Some had feared the debacle in Cyprus would lead to stress in the banking systems of other peripheral economies."

Taco Bell is working on a new, low-end menu, chief marketing officer Brian Niccol said. Niccol made the announcement on a conference call, according to a report by Bloomberg News.† Taco Bell is already known for offering cheap Mexican food. The extensive value menu offers items for 79, 89, and 99 cents.† The new, $1 menu is being tested in Sacramento and Kansas City. It might replace the current "Why Pay More" menu, according to Bloomberg.† The company also tried to get into higher-end food last year, releasing Cantina bowls with premium ingredients like steak and guacamole.† The Cantina release was seen as an attempt to compete with Chipotle, though the two restaurants serve very different demographics.†
After closing at an all-time high in April, the stock market saw a big sell-off on May 1. Once again, traders were asking themselves if they should "Sell in May and go away." This old stock market rule was coined because there is actually some strong historical data to back it up. Walter Zimmerman, the top technical analyst at United-ICAP, charted the performance of a $10,000 investment in 1950 if you sold in May, and then bought back on November 1. "The other half of the proverb is ëBuy Back on Saint Crispinís Day,í" said Zimmerman.† "That would be 25th October." "This advice has shined the brightest in those years with the most extreme bullish sentiment going into May." Check it out: United-ICAP Remember history is a guide, but never gospel.
mhauri via FlickrShe got in touch writing that "one perspective missing from your blog is that of recent MBA graduates who still are extremely enamoured by the 'glamorous' world of mergers and acquisitions. While all of us have heard the stories and read standard books like City Boy and Monkey Business, one really thinks it can't be that bad. But the typical life of an MBA associate in M&amp;A is anywhere between one and three years, when eventually most realise that the salaries are not worth the suffering." She is a cheerful woman in her mid-20s, born and raised in Asia. She has also written the hilarious Game of Clones blog about her time in an investment bank. "Because some star bankers behave so arrogantly they are an easy target for popular anger, but I really believe a lot of them just need a hug. After I left the bank, I saw this documentary about narcissistic personality disorders. It was interesting to see how narcissists lack empathy but remain extremely sensitive to criticism because deep inside they are so insecure. Looking back, I was surprised at the number of similar traits I could identify in my colleagues and superiors. "If you are genuinely confident, you don't need to act arrogant. Why buy all those expensive bottles of champagne unless you have something to compensate for and need to make yourself feel better through material possessions? "Banking is a great place to get a stamp of approval from the world. It validates your intelligence, your education. If you have the brand name of a major bulge bracket bank on your r√©sum√©, it proves that you have been through the grind and can work hard. Everybody loves to hate bankers, but people start to consider you in a new light when they hear you work for a major global bank. "I did an internship first. Why did I stay? Well, my internship experience was less than ideal. But they offered me a great sign-on bonus which, at that time, I thought was a quick way to pay off my debt. "However, after almost two years, I realised it was not for me. I am now in a different area in finance, still in an investment bank but no longer front office [revenue generating]. It's a very different work environment. People actually greet each other in the morning. I don't get frowned upon when I have to leave for a dentist appointment. If I have not been well, people will inquire how I feel the next day. Compare that to the front office. One time my superior told me that getting the flu had been 'reckless'. "In my time there, I learned so much. Professionally, of course: how to handle stress and all the monkey tasks they make you do. But the real lessons were personal: how quickly you can forget yourself, and how easily you become the worst version of yourself. "My frustrations were at the tip of my nose. I was permanently stressed, and this carried over to the rest of my life: the chocolate getting stuck in the vending machine, the taxi showing up late, being stranded in traffic ‚Äì it took very little to provoke a reaction. You have to be fast and on the edge and alert all the time in your work, and you begin to expect the same instant gratification from the rest of the world. "Then there's the gradual loss of the ability to empathise. There are people out there with far greater problems than bankers, who are so much worse off. It helps if you can see that, but somehow people in investment banks lose touch with reality. "I am from the non-western world and saw extreme poverty. The thing is, the life of an investment banker is such that you become entirely self-absorbed and self-centred. You forget there's a world out there with real problems. "You spend so much time at work that even your partner doesn't really know what you're going through. You find more and more commonalities with your peers at work, which feeds into this sense of living in a bubble. "When junior bankers are recruited at school, we are told that we'll be working on 'transformational multimillion deals with regular client interaction and visibility with C-level executives' of large corporates. In reality, for junior bankers, there is a lot more execution/implementation work, like an assembly line with very little strategic input. The only 'senior management exposure' you realistically get is your own VP or MD (line manager), and the only jet-setting you do is from work to home and back. So investment banks hire the very best people, then make them do really basic and routine tasks, despite putting them through an incredibly stressful hiring process. "I have to say, though, that professors in business school did have a running joke: 'You will all go into investment banks and we'll see how long you last.' They've seen the pattern. Some even said: 'So you have sold your soul?' "What's the work like? Mergers and acquisitions is about trying to convince business clients to do a deal and then executing those deals. To gain the initial business ‚Äì there is a lot of pitching and marketing. And these pitch books are put together by ‚Ä¶ junior bankers. So what I found myself doing all day was reviewing work of my analysts, formatting presentations, making mind-numbing iterations provided by seniors, doing some Excel wizardry, fixing footnotes on pages ‚Ä¶ A managing director doesn't like the mustard yellow you used in the presentation and now you have to spend a full night replacing it with light yellow. Or a few hours before the deadline, a director insists that we remove the gridlines behind all the graphs ... I realised, I have a brain and it's not being used. "You work 15-16 hours shifts, your weekends are forfeited and you never know if you have to cancel your holiday. This combination makes it really tough; not only are you dead-tired, you cannot plan your schedule, and hence you cannot work towards a moment when you know you'll be able to relax. "Because at any time your superior can claim you. This sinking feeling when you see the little red light flash on your BlackBerry. From that moment on, you have to check it, you have to know if something important has come up. It was all too common to go for dinner with my investment banker friends on a weekday and there would be a moment when all of us would be checking in with our BlackBerrys. "It is not unusual to see investment bankers become stressed, depressed and lonely. Many look much older than they are because they age so much faster. I used to think of people that I worked with and look up their pictures on the intranet. All these once healthy, youthful, smiling faces had slowly morphed into raisins. "It's not the long hours, though these are terrible. What got to me was the artificial stress. We were constantly put under fake deadlines, creating unnecessary stress. I'd be told to have something ready by 10pm on Tuesday, although my superior wouldn't look at until midday on Thursday. Yet, the 10pm Tuesday deadline causes incredible grief. "Outsiders focus on the pay investment bankers get. What they may not see is what that pay means to the bank: they effectively absolve themselves of all responsibility to treat you well. Your superiors don't care if you haven't slept in four days, or that your weekend is ruined. "You're a resource in banks, not a human being, and that applies to the people higher up as well. Years of service don't matter. How much money you brought in doesn't matter. If you are seen as no longer performing ,you are chucked out without the bank batting an eyelid. "That's such an inconsistency: you are treated as completely indispensable in the sense that, when the bank needs you, you have to drop everything at once, cancel vacations or weekends. Then, from one moment to the next, you're fired and marched out of the building five minutes later. So how can the bank cope with your sudden disappearance if earlier your presence was absolutely necessary at all times? "The unnecessary stress and the work is really a rite of passage, I think. My superiors seemed to think: 'I went through this, so why wouldn't you?' It makes you wonder: what are the investment bankers like who come through a system like this? Are they filtering out people for maximum endurance? Obedience? "I suppose an important difference between me and colleagues who did stay on is that I never identified with the bank. The tipping point was when my parents were over from the other side of the globe, and I hardly saw them. "Looking back, it's telling how little I have got to know about colleagues' personal life outside the bank. All those hours, yet everyone kept such a distance. At least with some colleagues who are from business school, you build a bond, but with most others, you just don't bring up personal stuff ‚Äì this is something you pick up from the start. Just put your head down and work hard. It is hardly an exaggeration to say that the main topic of conversation in the front office is complaining about other people at work. "That's another change with the organisation I work for now: you know about colleagues' personal lives. "As juniors they tell you 'after this, you can do anything'. The truth is, almost everyone at a given point of time in their banking career has seriously evaluated quitting and looks for an exit. However, there is a misplaced sense of prestige that comes from working at an investment bank that makes it hard for people to leave. There's the money: you're unlikely to find a job that pays almost 100K ‚Äì most people will probably need a lifetime to earn that, while in banking it is earned by a 25-26-year-old. And finding something else is not easy, not in this economic climate. After I resolved to leave, it took me eight months to find a new job. "One thing that pushed me towards the big banks are the visa requirements. It's simply much easier to be sponsored by the big banks if you are, like me, an international, ie, a foreigner from outside the EU. How it works out is that the administration costs are so high that smaller companies just can't afford me. Another consequence of this is that the exit opportunities for internationals are limited. If I quit at an investment bank without landing another job first, I can find myself kicked out of the country. "On the dating scene, telling guys you're an investment banker is disastrous. I found out soon enough. It acts like a man-repellent. Men seem to feel threatened by women as investment bankers. Meanwhile my male colleagues told me: 'I'd never date an investment banker.' They know what kind of life a female investment banker lives, how she would always be tired and irritable and stressed. "Looking at the very few women who made it to the top in our bank, I see their point. I remember one time I asked one of those women about her work-life balance, and she said: 'You have to get a stay-at-home husband.' Ha ha! I was like, 'OK, where do I get these? Is there a website?' "I don't think that things have changed at all since the crisis, not fundamentally. Nothing will work until banks reorganise their culture so their employees become more vested in the bank's success." ‚Ä¢ To comment on this interview, please visit the accompanying blogpost This article originally appeared on guardian.co.uk

The eventful week concludes with the US employment report tomorrow. It comes on the heels of a series of economic reports that were weaker than the consensus expected and points to a loss of momentum in late Q1 that is carrying into Q2. Although the weekly initial jobless claims reported today was counter to this pattern, as they recorded new cyclical lows, during the survey week for the national figures, weekly jobless claims were a bit higher. The employment component in the manufacturing ISM was lower. The ADP estimate was also disappointing. The 119k private sector jobs compared with consensus expectations of 150k and the March estimate was cut by 27k to 131k (the BLS initial estimate was 95k for private sector jobs). Since their methodological revisions there have been six reports before this week's. Three times the ADP estimate was above the BLS initial estimate for an average miss of about 45k. Three times the ADP estimate was weaker than the BLS figure. The average miss was about 34k.† The Bloomberg consensus calls for a 155k net increase in private sector employment. This would represent an increase from the initially reported 95k for March, which of course is subject to revision. Economists had generally under-estimated the strength of high frequency data in early Q1 and by the time they adjusted, the US economy began softening. This pattern warns of downside risks to tomorrow's jobs report. Yet, even if the number is in line with expectations, it represents a clear slowing. The 3-month average is 171k and the 6-month average is near 201k.† Although the March jobs data disappointed, the fact that the work week increased by 6 minutes may have helped mitigate economic impact. The increase in hours worked, which matched the cyclical peak, coupled with the rise in temporary workers, was seen by some as suggestive of positive underling dynamics. Slippage in April aggravate any disappointment headline figures. One of the big mysteries surrounding the US labor market has been the decline of the participation rate. Last year, the participation rate fell 0.4% to 63.7%. The decline in the participation of 25-54 year olds was only partially offset by the increased participation among workers 55 and older. There seems to be both cyclical and structural aspects. Market participants appreciate in a way they may not have before the crisis that the unemployment rate says more about the participation rate than job creation itself. Even more broadly, there seem to be cyclical and structural issues with the US labor market. Consider, for example, that in recent years the US has gained manufacturing jobs but continues to bleed clerical jobs. This would seem to be a reflection not of off-shoring, but of technological advances. There also seems to be some skill mismatch. Reports suggest there are some 3.5 mln job vacancies in the US, yet high unemployment. There also appears to be another shift taking place in the US labor market. Consider that in some 15% of taxi drivers have a college degree now compared with 1% in 1970, according to a recent essay by the FT's Edward Luce, who cited work by the Center for College Affordability and Productivity. A full quarter of sales clerks have a college degree compared with 5% in 1970 and 5% of janitors now have a college degree. And as Luce notes, almost half (46%) of those who go to college fail to complete the 4-year degree in six years.        Read more posts on Marc to Market ª
realestategreenwich.comIn theory, a seven figure annual pay packet should be more than enough to live on. In the UK, only the top 1% of income taxpayers earn anything more than ¬£150k according to figures from the Office of National Statistics. In the US, the top 1% of people earn more than $370k according to the Internal Revenue Service.¬† And yet, some bankers in the top bracket are having money troubles. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really not that unusual to find Wall Street bankers who are close to declaring themselves bankrupt,‚Äù said Gary Goldstein, co-founder of U.S. search firm Whitney Partners. ‚ÄúSome people are really struggling.‚Äù Claims that bankers are having problems making ends meet won‚Äôt do much to ingratiate them to the public. At last week‚Äôs Barclays Annual General Meeting, Joan Woolard, a pensioner from the north of England berated Barclays for overpaying its bankers. Anyone who wanted more than ¬£1m ($1.5m) a year was simply a ‚Äúgreedy b*stard,‚Äù said Woolard. For some people working in financial services, however, ¬£1m is simply what‚Äôs needed to cover the cost of living. ‚ÄúYou get a lot of people who have a very expensive lifestyle,‚Äù said Louise Cooper, a former Goldman Sachs salesperson and financial analyst at Cooper City. ‚ÄúThey will always have a nanny, private schools for the children and they will have a very big expensive house. All of this has to be paid for out of taxable income,‚Äù she points out. ‚ÄúWith a top tax rate of 45%, this means that you need to be earning nearly double what you‚Äôre spending.‚Äù Tax is an issue in the U.S. too. ‚ÄúAfter tax, your million dollars will be around $600k,‚Äù said Goldstein. ‚ÄúOut of that, you get people trying to pay the mortgages on, and maintain houses, in the Hamptons and Manhattan, to put three children through private schools costing $40k a year each, and to pay living costs.‚Äù Why can‚Äôt bankers simply ditch the house in the Hamptons and put their children into state run educational establishments? Unfortunately, this seems easier said than done. ‚ÄúWhen you work in banking, you end up surrounded by people who earn a lot of money,‚Äù said Erika Shapiro, a former fixed income saleswoman at Goldman, Citi, Credit Suisse and UBS who became a yoga instructor.¬†‚ÄúEveryone around you has a big mortgage and is sending their children to private schools.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou just get trapped at a certain level of expenditure,‚Äù said Tony Greenham, a former investment banker at Barclays and head of finance and business at the New Economics Foundation. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre in a peer group which aspires to and achieves a certain standard of house in a certain area, a certain type of holiday home, and certain schooling for your children.‚Äù
Daniel Goodman / Business InsiderTony Manfred, Laura Stampler (left), Aly Weisman (rear), and Leah Goldman.In case you want a vivid example of how the Wall Street and tech worlds have changed in the past couple of decades... Business Insider is now a much bigger company than 1990s Internet behemoth Yahoo, Inc. was when it went public. And so are hundreds of other tech and media companies that are still private companies and probably always will be. Yahoo! went public on April 17th, 1996. The stock exploded, naturally, soaring from an IPO price of $13 a share to $45 and then closing for the day at $33. ¬†This gave Yahoo! an $850 million market value. The most stunning aspect of the Yahoo! IPO, of course, was how young the company was. When it went public, it was only about 13 months old. And in terms of financial performance, Yahoo was a veritable infant: The company had generated only $1.4 million of revenue in 1995, the year before it went public. And the company's revenue in the quarter of the IPO--the first quarter of 1996--was only $1.7 million. For comparison, Business Insider generated about $10 million of revenue last year. But a company our size wouldn't even think of going public today, let alone a company the size that Yahoo and other seminal Internet companies were back in 1996. It would just be too expensive and too much of a headache. The truth, unfortunately, is that only masochistic companies would ever go public today, unless they're so massive, mature, and boring that most of the early opportunity has already been wrung out of them. The public market and media have become so hostile to high-risk, high-reward investments like Yahoo! that companies that go public are just setting themselves up for abuse and misery. It also now costs a fortune to go public and be public, in part because of the millions of dollars of accounting, compliance, and legal fees you have to pay to fend off the inevitable barrage of lawsuits you'll be hit with the moment your stock opens. So no company that can avoid going public would ever go public today. This, by the way, is a bummer. Because no young companies go public, even aggressive investors who want to accept the risks of investing in them are deprived of the opportunity to do so. And promising young companies can no longer raise money from these investors to fund aggressive investment and growth.¬† The tech industry has worked around this problem by developing a huge market for private investment--late-stage venture capital firms, private-equity firms, etc. And that's a perfectly easy way for growing companies to raise capital. (That's how we've raised capital, for example.) But this market still has more "friction" than our IPO market once did. And it's harder for aggressive investors to find promising early-stage companies to invest in. And that's a shame. Not just for emerging high-risk high-reward companies--for aggressive investors as well. Yahoo, of course, was an extraordinary success story--one of the fastest growing media companies in history. Those who bet on Yahoo! back in 1996 made more than 50X their money over the next three years (and then lost most of it again if they hung on too long). Few of today's private companies will grow at anything like the rates Yahoo did in the late 1990s (we certainly won't), and the return on investment on these companies will likely be much lower. But when those of us who were around back in the mid-1990s reflect on the excitement around the developing industry and public markets at that time, it's hard not to feel like we've all lost something. Yes, there are fewer opportunities now for public market investors to be stupid and buy stocks that are too risky for them and that they have no business buying. (Although, as Facebook's IPO illustrates, even waiting until companies are mature won't stop this from happening). But there are also fewer opportunities for those who want to make speculative investments and are grown-up enough to accept responsibility for making them. (True speculators have now been reduced to gambling on Bitcoin, which is considerably riskier!) And, today, unfortunately, ¬†most of the really exciting action in the tech industry now happens in the relative darkness of the private market.

Oyster.comHere's more evidence Bitcoin isn't going anywhere. We've found a guy who claims to be putting his Trump Soho condo up for sale.† And he will only take payment in Bitcoin. Later today, he will advertise the property exclusively on BitPremier, the first-ever online Bitcoin exchange exclusively for luxury goods. The site launches today. Here's the condo owner's exact note to us, via BitPremier founder Alan Silbert: I prefer to own Bitcoin to property that's why I would be happy to sell it in bitcoin. I think property is a better asset class than USD, and bitcoin a better asset class than property. We recently spoke by phone with Silbert, who also serves as a VP for GE Capital, about the goals for BitPremier. He said purchasing options for people who own lots of Bitcoin have thus far been limited. "There are plenty of Bitcoin millionaires out there, and it's burning a hole in their pocket," he said. "I think buyers will be easy to come by." Along with the choice condo, the site will also launch with a Bahamas villa, a Leroy Neiman artwork, and a high-end watch. A Ferrari and Mercedes are also imminent, Silber said. † "We're finding a lot of wealthy, smart people are getting into the game with Bitcoin," he explained. "I think as the ecosystem matures, I think you're going to see a lot more of that." Bitcoin was trading near $110 on Mt. Gox today.

One of the biggest themes in global markets is the search for yield. Government bond yields across the developed world are at or near record lows as central banks continue full-on monetary easing.¬†One major side effect of depressed yields on government bonds has been a flood of money into riskier assets like junk bonds ‚Äì or Rwandan sovereign debt ‚Äì from investors looking for interest income. From a technical standpoint, the flood of money from this central bank-inspired trade has become the overriding factor in some of these riskier areas of the fixed income space, but it's seeped into equity markets as well as investors pile into stocks that pay big dividends for the same reason. The chart below from Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale further cements this theme. "It identifies clearly the search for yield in the past three months as a single coherent trade," says SocGen strategist Sebastien Galy. The chart is a matrix plotting correlations of various asset returns against each other. If the returns of any two assets over the past three months are 90% correlated or higher, then that pair of assets shows up as a white dot on the matrix. (That's why there is a white diagonal line running down the middle of the chart ‚Äì any asset paired with itself will obviously display a 100% return correlation.) What is interesting is what is going on around that diagonal line. For example, in the short-term fixed income space, the returns of all sorts of assets are 90% (or more) correlated with each other. That's the big square of white dots in the top-left corner of the matrix. Move further down the diagonal line, and it gets even more interesting. The MSCI row and the MSCI column denote the equity space. Where the two intersect, there are a bunch more white dots, suggesting that various equity indices have been at least 90% correlated over the last three months. Move to the left along the MSCI row, though, and you find more white dots where it intersects with the 10-year bonds column. That suggests that several 10-year bonds are highly correlated with several stocks. Moving along the MSCI row to the right, there are a bunch more white dots that show how highly correlated the MSCI indices are with currencies (in the "FX" column). So, there it is: one big central bank trade. Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale

FortuneLegendary investor Warren Buffett, the founder of Berkshire Hathaway,†spoke with Fortune magazine's Pattie Sellers†in Omaha, Nebraska today.† He answered questions and talked about women, work and life. The Oracle of Omaha published an essay for Fortune about being bullish on women. †He also Tweeted for the first time.† We've included highlights from the chat. Buffett, who is one of the most successful investors of all time, was asked about how he defines success by a student in the audience. † "Somebody said success is getting what you want, happiness is wanting what you get. One doesn't preclude the other," Buffett responded.† "I would say when you get to be my age...if the people that you want to have love you, love you, you're a success," he said. He explained that you can have all the money in the world and buildings named after you, but unless you have people that really care about you, you're not a success. "If those people love you after they've seen you in action for many, many years, you're a success."† Well said. Fortune's Seller noted that Fortune's Carol Loomis said that Buffett is the least prejudiced executive she knows. †He does care about brains, though, but what's more important is someone's character, Buffett said. † He was asked about his female role models during the talk. †He said his first wife opened his eyes to a lot of things and that Carol Loomis and Katharine Graham of†The Washington Post are also his role models.† Fortune's Seller asked him about how he feels about going on Twitter. "It's pretty daring, but I'll try," he said of the social media site. His first Tweet was, "Warren is in the House." Buffett, who doesn't even have a computer on his desk in his office, joked that you can teach an old dog new tricks.† The conversation then shifted back to women in the workplace. "My job is to have the right people in the top slots for those businesses," he said. †"Most of the time when we buy a business, the management comes with it." † He said that he doesn't have to change management very often, but when he does, he picks the best people to do the job. †It doesn't make any difference what their age, sex, or educational background is. "Talent is scarce... You want them to have a feeling of ownership...Therefore, we better have the most talented," Buffett said, adding, the "can't afford having a blacklist for who they will put in the job."† "We're not looking for big names, we're looking for big brains," he added. The topic of succession also came up. Buffett, 82, said they spend more time on that at board meetings. "If I should die tonight, it's very important who takes over tomorrow and it's very important that decision has already been made and that everybody's onboard among the board members on that decision. †That is the key factor at Berkshire," he said. He said the directors know that he won't be there one day and who they pick to succeed him is extremely important.† He said they have six directors under 60 and they are the "directors of the future." He added that three of those directors are women. Former model Christy Turlington Tweeted at Fortune and asked Buffett the most important lesson he learned from his mother.† Buffett said that he didn't get along with his mother all that well. He later added that it bothered her that he didn't get along with her. †He said that he learned his most important lessons from his father.† He said that his mother thought she was supposed to serve his father. † "She lived a life that was dictated by my father's interests and sort of the society at the time," he said, adding, that his mother was very very smart and that she was there to take care of the needs of the family. He said he thinks it was bad for her that she had to serve his father and maybe deep down she felt it wasn't fair, but she also felt that was what she was supposed to do in life. Another female audience member studying investing and finance in business school asked Buffett how she can stand out in finance.† He said he would advice anybody whether female or male to learn all you can about it and then try to build an audited record, even if it's a small entity.† "That's the minor league batting average to the major league scout," he said, adding they don't care about your gender if you can make money.† He said you can't "learn enough" about investments. †He advised reading everything you can and doing investing of your own, even if it's just a hundred bucks.† Someone Tweeted and asked Buffett to have a Coke at Dairy Queen. †Buffett explained that Dairy Queen is a "great social spot."†
CNBC host Carl Quintanilla was just on TV trying on Google Glass for the first time. He asked a devastating question.
APSometimes fiscal policy is like the weather: Everyone talks about it but nobody ever does anything about it. It's certainly been a big topic of conversation here at the Milken Institute Global Conference. For the most part, even the talk has been a bit uninspiring. Nearly every panel over the past three days has featured someone who complains about dysfunction in Washington being a drag on the economy. Most panelists are more or less in agreement with the folks who Paul Krugman calls "The Very Serious People": They want a grand agreement for medium term deficit reduction, on the often unarticulated grounds that future deficits are somehow traveling back in time and slowing our economy now. In this context, the Wednesday morning presentation by Dan Arbess, a partner at Perella Weinberg and chief investment officer at PWP Xerion Funds, was startling because of how deeply it broke from the standard narrative. We've been wrong to assume that the economic crisis is over, Arbess said. We stopped the crisis from reaching Great Depression levels through drastic fiscal actions such as TARP and the Obama administration's fiscal stimulus. But almost as suddenly as we started, we stopped these efforts, which Arbess says has resulted in us being "mired down" for the past four years. What's kept us afloat has been monetary policy, but that's now reaching its limits, according to Arbess. The threat of deflation is once again rearing its head. "The persistent risk in our economy is deflation not inflation," Arbess said. (Read More: Market's Great‚Ä¶If You're Selling) His proposed solution is that we start directly funding government expenditures through the central bank. That is, we should stop relying on taxes or further debt issuances to finance government‚Äîor at least reduce our reliance on taxes and bonds. Just let the Federal Reserve pay the government's bills by exercising its money creation powers. Although Arbess didn't say so directly, he's clearly been influenced by a groundbreaking February speech of Adair Turner, the chairman of the British Financial Services Authority. Turner termed the policy of using newly created money to directly finance tax cuts and new spending "Overt Monetary Financing" and argued that the inflationary effects of such a policy were misplaced in the context of clear targets and an independent central bank. Arbess pointed out that this idea isn't really all that new. It's been around since Milton Friedman argued in a 1948 paper that all government deficits should be financed with noninterest bearing fiat money. Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, argued explicitly in 2003 that Japan should consider "a tax cut ‚Ä¶ in effect financed by money creation." It was this idea‚Äîwhich people termed "helicopter money"‚Äîthat got him the nickname Helicopter Ben. (Read More: Bonderman Is Skeptic on Japan) Of course, any talk of direct central bank financing of government triggers fears of hyper-inflation. Arbess argues that the key to avoiding inflation would be to have clearly stated growth and inflation targets. When these were reached or exceeded, the Fed would end or taper off the Overt Monetary Financing policy. How much more stimulating would OMF be than quantitative easing? Consider the thought experiment proposed by Anatole Kaletsky: At present the Fed prints $85 billion of new money monthly and distributes it to banks and Wall Street investors by buying government bonds. And the Fed has promised to continue this monthly "quantitative easing" until such time as unemployment drops and is clearly and sustainably declining to more normal levels. Now suppose instead that the Fed divided its $85 billion monthly money production into 300 million checks of $283 each and sent these to every man, woman and child in America. Suppose, moreover, that the Fed promised to keep sending out these checks, worth more than $1,000 a month for a four-person household, until the United States reached its unemployment target‚Äîand the Fed chairman added that he would increase the checks to $1,500 or $2,000 a month for that household if $1,000 monthly proved insufficient. There can be little doubt that this deluge of free money would stimulate consumer spending and revive employment‚Äîand no doubt that it would be infinitely more effective than distributing money to bond investors and banks through QE. For a very old idea, it's still a radical notion. Arbess gets credit as the first hedge fund manager to raise it in such a public way.
BluCigsYesterday, we showcased the 10 technologies Citi says are going to "disrupt" the world. In other words, these are things that will dramatically alter how their respective industries operate. There was one technology you could put in your mouth: e-cigarettes. What are e-cigarettes? They're basically thin pipes of vaporized, flavored nicotine. When you take a drag, a pressure-activated switch turns on a miniature heater that emits fake smoke. They're said to be less addictive than regular smokes, and more importantly, cheaper. We've previously discussed some of the hurdles e-cigs face: regulation, flavor, general coolness. Citi does not discount those, but says they won't stand in the way of the product becoming a $3 billion market segment. Here's their forecast in chart form: Citi Citi tobacco analysts¬†Adam Spielman and Vivien Azer note that the big players are scrambling to get a piece of the action: E-cigarettes have become an increasing focus for investors, especially in the U.S., given 1) the relative absence of innovation seen in the tobacco industry, and 2) the product‚Äôs increased visibility since Lorillard‚Äôs acquisition of blue eCigs in April 2012. Indeed, while still a small contributor to Lorillard‚Äôs sales and profits, (1.3% of sales and 0.1% of profits in FY12) with the company opting to offer specific financial disclosure of this business it will continue to garner increased investor¬† Further, we expect this will become an increasing focus for global investors, as Reynolds American has introduced their own e-cigarette brand, Vuse, into test markets in the U.S. and we expect they will be rolling out this product into the broader market in the near future. Looks like a lot of people are gonna be coughing it up for this product.

Over the last three days, countries around the world have been publishing their manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) reports. And the message around the world is clear: manufacturing activity decelerated sharply in April. The U.S. and China are growing marginally, but both decelerated.¬† Europe continues to be in sharp contraction.¬† And even Germany saw its manufacturing sector begin to contract in April. According to JP Morgan, the global manufacturing PMI fell to 50.5 in April, down from 51.1 in March. A reading above 50 signals expansion. "The rate of expansion decelerated slightly during April, meaning that growth so far in 2013 has remained, at best, only marginal," they wrote. "This is still an improvement compared to the contractions signalled throughout much of the second half of last year." "April saw manufacturing production increase at the slowest rate in the year-to-date, as growth of new order inflows also slipped to a near-stagnant pace. New export orders posted a marginal gain for the second month running in April." JP Morgan, Markit JP Morgan, Markit

Everyone's talking about all the new oil and gas being produced thanks to new drilling methods. But there's another narrative nipping at the shale boom's heels: solar energy.¬† And it's expanding just as fast. It's just that the scale is not quite the same. But that's changing. Citi has just named solar photovoltaics, which convert solar radiation into electric currents via semiconductors, to its list of 10 world-disrupting technologies. In a note this week in advance of the disruption report, Citi's Jason Channell said that in many cases, renewables are already at cost parity with established forms of electricity sources.¬† The biggest surprise in recent years has been the speed at which the price of solar panels has reduced, resulting in cost parity being achieved in certain areas much more quickly than was ever expected; the key point about the future is that these fast ‚Äòlearning rates‚Äô are likely to continue, meaning that the technology just keeps getting cheaper. Below is a chart showing where "socket" or grid parity has already been achieved. (Grid parity is when a source of power becomes cost competitive with other sources.) The lines represent the pattern of expanding solar power in a given year ‚Äî so at peak solar exposure, parts of the southwest U.S. are now already capable of meeting their electricity needs via solar panels.¬† Citi He also adds this cool chart showing that the Age of Renewables has only just begun.¬† Citi Channell writes: The rapidly expanding parity provides enormous scope for growth in the solar industry, driven by standalone economics as opposed to subsidies, which are becoming ever scarcer in an austerity-driven world. As a previous Saudi oil minister once noted, ‚ÄúThe stone age didn‚Äôt end for a lack of stones...‚Äù, and this substitutional process can be well demonstrated looking at the US energy mix over the longer term. Gas isn't going away, but renewables are coming on strong.
The American manufacturing renaissance has become one of the biggest emerging economic stories in the world. The basic idea is that rising overseas labor costs and falling domestic energy costs will encourage manufacturers to bring production back to the U.S. This is bad news for many of the emerging markets, which tend to be the low-cost producers. However, one emerging market could come out a big winner: Mexico. Here's Morgan Stanley's Manoj Pradhan and Jonathan Garner on the basic points for Mexico: The clear likely beneficiary here for three reasons: i) recent outperformance on competitive grounds ‚Äì it has gained market share in the US and automobile production remains an indirect threat to other less efficient LatAm manufacturers; ii) Mexico has always been strongly plugged in to the US manufacturing cycle and should remain a key part of the supply chain, thanks to NAFTA; and iii) Mexico‚Äôs structural reforms are likely to reduce structural rigidities at the same time as the tailwinds outlined above kick in. Morgan Stanley's Nikolaj Lippman and Luis Arcentales add to the conversation: A sustained manufacturing revival in the US ‚Äì driven by factors including a weaker US dollar and lower energy costs ‚Äì will create a new competitor for the EM world, but a partner for Mexico, and the benefits could be felt across the Mexican economy for years, perhaps even decades. Persistent market share gains by Mexico in recent years, importantly, suggest that the Mexican industrial sector has been restructuring just in time to benefit from renewed US competitiveness. Countries like China are well known for offering cheap labor.¬† But those costs have been rising rapidly, and they are on the verge of passing Mexico's labor costs. Here's a chart from Lippman and Arcentales: Morgan Stanley
noneck/ FlickrA number of major banks, mostly in London, were caught last summer in a whirlwind scandal for manipulating an obscure interest rate, the Libor. There were customary embarrassing instant messages and e-mails released in the complaint, and banks paid out billion dollar fines, but it was still hard to get people to pay attention to such an obscure number. The scandal just wasn't quite salacious enough. But now it seems that element has arrived. Regulators suspect that London's high-flying banking culture led to an attitude that welcomed deceitful, conspiratorial behavior between traders and brokers, the WSJ reports. Traders and brokers are bonded together because brokers make handsome commissions from executing trades. It's a "symbiotic" relationship, the Journal points out, and in London the rules about "trading favors" are looser than they are in NYC. Banks could easily spend $50,000 on a single trader. This, regulators say, created the perfect environment for something like the Libor scandal. In order to get traders to work with them, brokers allegedly gave traders early access to lucrative trades, bought entire trading desks lunch, flew them off to Vegas, procured cocaine and prostitutes for traders, and dropped straight cash at strip clubs. The Journal describes helicopter dates ... ¬†As recently as last summer, BGC Partners Inc., a New York-based brokerage, dispatched limousines to the homes of top traders at London banks. The limos ferried the traders' wives and girlfriends to a helicopter, which flew them to the Royal Ascot‚Äîa marquee event on London's social calendar‚Äîfor a day of horse races, according to people familiar with the event... Prostitutes ... A broader probe into the entertainment of trading clients by other brokers at Tradition, majority-owned by French financial-services company found evidence that some Tradition brokers hired prostitutes for traders, and took the traders to an outfit called Lady Marmalade Adult Parties, say people familiar with the investigation. The website of Lady Marmalade says it operates from a four-bedroom apartment in central London, equipped with an "erotic love swing," promising customers "an orgasmic time." The WSJ says that brokers admitted that after a wild night out with traders, there would be a line of trades on their desks waiting for execution the next morning. That's what you do for your friends, no? Read more salacious anecdotes at the Journal &gt;
Facebook is doing exactly what it should be doing. It is striving to create the most possible long-term value for its four important constituencies: Customers (users), employees, shareholders, and society. In short, it is doing what many more American companies should be doing: Investing for the long term, without worrying about the short-term impact on the bottom line. A company investing aggressively at the expense of short-term profit shouldn't be news. It should be what all companies do. Alas, it's so rare these days that it qualifies as downright startling. Most American companies and management teams have become so hijacked by short-term Wall Street traders, and so obsessed with their annual bonuses and stock prices, that they think about little more than "beating analysts' estimates" quarter after quarter. In so doing, they often under-invest in opportunities that could create vastly more value over the long term. Instead of making big, bold bets on projects that won't pay off for 5-7 years, for example, companies cut research and development to squeeze out a couple more pennies for this quarter's bottom line. Instead of investing in redeploying and retraining talented employees, they fire them. Instead of paying good employees well enough that the employees don't have to dedicate their working lives to enriching the company and yet still be poor, they "control labor costs." (Hello, Walmart. Hello, Starbucks and McDonald's. Hello, Apple Stores (although these, to Apple's great credit, do pay more than they have to)). And so on. Business Insider, St. Louis FedBig American companies now have the highest profit margins in history.As the charts below show, the obsession of American corporations and managements with short-term profits has led to the country's biggest companies earning the highest profits in history, both in absolute terms and as a percent of the economy. Meanwhile, the companies are paying the lowest wages in history. And the companies are investing in capital equipment at one of the lowest rates in history. Business Insider, St. Louis FedBig American companies are also paying the lowest wages in history--that's why their profits are so high.If you talk to companies about this, they will say they are obsessing about short-term profits and under-investing in the future because they have a "duty to shareholders" to deliver the highest financial return and highest stock-price possible, at all times. Importantly, however, the companies do not say this because it's some immutable law of business. It isn't. The companies say it because it's what they've been told by short-sighted but loud Wall Street fund managers, who are worried about how their funds are going to perform week, next month, and next quarter. These fund managers do not worry about how their funds will do over the next 5-10 years or what kinds of value the money they are investing is being used to create. Because that's not what they're hired or paid to do. Business Insider, St. Louis FedBig American companies are investing at one of the lowest rates in history. (Capital investment to GDP)The Wall Street investors are obsessed with short-term performance because investors in Wall Street funds have become obsessed with short-term performance: If a manager has a bad quarter, the fund's owners begin to grumble and gripe. If the manager has a bad year, the fund's owners start looking for new funds. If the manager has a few bad years, it's time to start looking for another job or career. Never mind that market cycles aren't measured in "quarters"--they last anywhere from a few years to decades. And never mind that the absolute worst way to invest is to "chase" the latest hot trend of the past few years. (This leads to you buying at the top and selling at the bottom.) There are lots of causes of the Wall Street Industrial Complex's myopic obsession with short-term profits, so it's not worth trying to pin the blame on any one participant. The important point is this: The short-term profit obsession is hurting companies, hurting average Americans, and hurting the economy. Why? Because the "cost-savings" that companies get when they don't invest in attractive long-term projects represent lost wages for American consumers and lost sales for other American companies. And those lost wages and lost sales constrain the economy's growth rate. In other words, because everyone is obsessed with "efficiency" and "maximized short-term profits," the economy is suffering through very high unemployment and slow growth. And this high unemployment and slow growth, importantly, is a direct result of companies' refusal to invest aggressively in the future. That brings us back to Facebook. Over the last few quarters, to Wall Street's dismay, Facebook has announced that it was going to reduce its profits¬†by investing aggressively for the long term. As a result, Facebook's earnings per share did not grow in the first quarter. As a result, Facebook's stock is probably trading at a modestly lower level than it might be if Facebook had radically "cut costs" or reduced investment to produce the "highest possible earnings per share." Critically, however, by making these aggressive investments, Facebook is setting itself up to have a great run over the next 5-10 years. And it is setting itself up to be worth more in 5-10 years than it would be if it fretted about this quarter's earnings. In other words, instead of worrying about getting yelled at by a few fund managers who couldn't care less about Facebook's long-term value creation, Facebook is building its business for the long term. Thanks to this aggressive investment, over the long-term, Facebook (and Facebook stock) will likely be worth much more than it would be if Facebook had instead kowtowed to today's myopic fund managers. And, in the meantime, Facebook's aggressive investment is pumping cash back into the economy in the form of wages and the purchase of equipment and services from other companies. That last trend is not just good for Facebook. It's good for the global economy. So we should all tip our hats to Facebook. The other company that has always invested for the long term no matter how loudly Wall Street screams, of course, is Amazon. For the past 15 years, investors and the press have never stopped tut-tutting Amazon for its low profit margins. In the 1990s, the cool rap on Amazon was that it "would never make money." Now the rap is that Amazon isn't making enough money. Meanwhile, over the past ~15 years, Amazon's stock has risen more than 70X from its IPO price. And Amazon has become the dominant global force in eCommerce. And Amazon has built a spectacular service that hundreds of millions of customers in dozens of countries love. Amazon has never worried about this quarter's earnings per share. Amazon has never been afraid to make big, bold bets on the future. (It's making at least two very expensive ones today: Kindle and Amazon Web Services). Amazon has never worried about the screams of myopic, impatient investors. And now Facebook is following in Amazon's footsteps. In short, Facebook is focusing on creating value for the four constituencies that every great company should create value for: Facebook isn't just dancing on Wall Street's puppet strings. That's a great thing.¬† Not just for Facebook's customers, employees, and shareholders. But for the global economy, too. More companies need to think this way. And we should all celebrate the ones that do. SEE ALSO: Amazon's Letter To Shareholders Should Be An Inspiration To Every Company
It's called the "Terminating Bailouts for Taxpayer Fairness" Act, and David Vitter (R-LA) and Sherrod Brown (D-OH) have been talking about bringing it to the floor for the last month or so. They presented a complete version of the bill last week. Here in NYC there was little hair pulling in the media. Jamie Dimon didn't run around making speeches about the evils of regulation. The whole thing has been pretty quiet. Politico's Ben White reports that may be because Wall Street is quietly dispatching its army of lobbyists to take care of the problem for them. Check out this quote from industry vet Cam Fine, he's the president and CEO of the Independant Community Bankers of America. From Politico: ‚ÄúI have been in Washington leading ICBA for 10 years. I have experienced everything from the Wal-Mart bank charter fight, to the Fannie-Freddie accounting scandals, the Great Recession, bailouts, financial reform and Basel III. And I believe that Wall Street and the half dozen large trade groups that represent them in Washington have deployed more lobbyists on the TBTF issue than on any other issue since I came to D.C. ‚Ä¶ They must really be freaked out. There are more Wall Street lobbyists swarming Capitol Hill than there will be cicadas swarming the Washington metro area this summer ‚Äî and, worse, the lobbyists make more noise than the cicadas.‚Äù Washington is super muggy in the summer too. Gross.
APPope Francis continues to condemn capitalism's excesses. Yesterday, according to an AFP report, Pope Francis ripped into the "slave labor" conditions at a Bangladesh factory whose collapse killed hundreds.† And then this morning, the Pope Tweeted the following: My thoughts turn to all who are unemployed, often as a result of a self-centred mindset bent on profit at any cost. The Pope isn't a Marxist. And of course John Paul II, Francis' second predecessor, was a champion of capitalism. But massive unemployment is the world's top crisis. With many leaders focused on other topics, it's great that one of the most influential people in the world is giving this the attention it deserves.
AP ImagesThe ECB just cut the euro area benchmark refinancing rate 25 basis points to an all-time low of 0.50%, making it the first ECB rate cut since July 2012. Following the announcement, the euro rose to 1.3200 against the U.S. dollar from levels around 1.3060 prior to the release. Click here for the full release on the ECB's website &gt; During the press conference following the release, ECB President Mario Draghi said there was a very strong, prevailing consensus on the Governing Council toward an interest rate cut, and within that, there was a prevailing consensus toward a 25 basis-point cut. However, he also made clear that the ECB stands ready to act further if necessary. The euro area deposit rate was left on hold at 0%, but during the Q&amp;A following the press conference, Draghi said the ECB has an "open mind" toward taking the deposit rate negative in the future, and that the central bank is technically ready to take such action. These comments about taking the deposit rate negative sent the euro plunging around 100 pips against the U.S. dollar. With regard to why a rate cut was decided on today when only a few months ago it was viewed as ineffective stimulus, Draghi cited two developments. The first development that is supposed to make a rate cut more effective today than a few months ago is some easing in recent months of the financial fragmentation that has characterized the euro zone over the past few years. The second development is that economic weakness has spread to the euro zone's "core economies," making a rate cut more appropriate across the euro zone as opposed to only in the periphery.
Chatter out of the ECB that rates could go negative has been awesome for gold.

Sotheby'sEveryone on the Street is buzzing about Andrew Ross Sorkin's must-read piece in The New York Times on former Barclays CEO Bob Diamond.¬† It's a great reflective profile on the top banker who fell from grace last summer amid the LIBOR rigging scandal. It's also full of nuggets like how Diamond was able to purchase a $37 million penthouse in New York without getting caught. ¬† Pay attention. From the NYTimes:¬† And his current residence is a $37 million penthouse apartment on the 40th floor of 15 Central Park West, where Sting and Lloyd Blankfein also live. Diamond was aware enough of the ‚Äúoptics‚Äù that he tried to hide the fact that he was buying the apartment by purchasing it under the name of Novgorod, a Russian-sounding company he created to make it appear that an oligarch had bought the apartment. It worked. The New York Observer reported at the time: ‚ÄúAre the Good Times Back? 15 Central Park West Penthouse Sells for $37 M.‚Äù The article never mentioned the name of the real owner. We looked up the old New York Observer article. ¬†Here's what it said: The buyers are listed as the corporations Novgorod and Novgorod Two‚Äìas in the Russian city. Paul Wrobleski of Clarfeld Financial Advisors, listed as a contact for the buyer, did not return several messages. Now that's how it's done.¬†
Liberal Democrats On asking for money, in a simple three step process.¬†  Warning: Metaphor in use. Step 1.¬† Find a donor. Step 2. ‚ÄúOh, hi, it‚Äôs you.¬† Listen, can I ask you a favor?¬† Can you hold my baby for a minute?‚Äù Step 3.¬† In a few moments, donor not only cuddles baby ‚Äì but ends up nose-to-nose whispering nonsense noises ‚Äì and then ‚ÄúI love you.‚Äù If you‚Äôre trying to raise money for your organization, repeat steps 1 through 3. Asking for money is no more difficult than ‚ÄúI love you.‚Äù¬† If you can say that, and inspire someone else to say that, you can raise all the money you‚Äôll ever need for your worthy cause. I‚Äôve been the Annual Fund Co-Chair of my high school[1] for the past three years.¬† I‚Äôve overcome squeamishness about asking for money by focusing on the shared love.¬† I love the school, and I‚Äôm usually soliciting money from people who also already love the school.¬† It‚Äôs the easiest thing in the world. ¬† It shouldn‚Äôt be awkward You‚Äôve always assumed that asking for money is scary and awkward.¬† So was dating in junior high ‚Äì which typically does not involve ‚Äòlove‚Äô in the most effective way. But if you love your cause, and if you‚Äôre helping your donor fall in love with the cause and the people around it, you‚Äôre winning.¬† You just need to say ‚ÄòI love you‚Äô to your worthy cause and to help your donor say ‚ÄòI love you‚Äô to you and your cause.¬† And that‚Äôs it. The asking part follows naturally for people who fall in love with a cause. Is it hard to ask the other parent of your infant child to warm up a bottle in the middle of the night?¬† No, it‚Äôs the easiest and most natural thing in the world. But what about data? You‚Äôve read that the world of philanthropy is different now ‚Äì in particular now that metrics and data have taken over the process.¬† You‚Äôve learned that your non-profit must be business-like and show a ‚Äòreturn on investment.‚Äô Yes and No. Best business practices like data-collection, efficiency, and metrics help you do your job better, so should be adopted by your organization for their own sake.¬† But if you‚Äôre collecting data just to have something to show current and prospective donors, you‚Äôre not making good use of anyone‚Äôs time, or making good use of the data itself. Track numbers that matter and improve your non-profit practice all for their own sake, and that‚Äôs all the ‚Äòmetrics‚Äô you‚Äôll ever really need. Irrational love At the moment of giving, donors must have an irrational love for what your organizations does better than anyone else. All the data in the world cannot make a donor fall deeply, madly, irrationally in love with you and your cause.¬† Data doesn‚Äôt lead to love, only to a rational comparison between your group and someone else‚Äôs worthy cause.¬† Which rational comparison mindset is a place you don‚Äôt want to be if you‚Äôre trying to raise a lot of money. When you think about it, the act of giving away money is totally irrational, so the more you engage a donor‚Äôs rational thought process, the further you are from success. Donors give because they love the people in the organization ‚Äì or because they love some tender feeling that your group inspired. Of course data helps you do your job, but only love inspires donors. So stay focused on the love. If you raise money for an organization, remember this most important step: ‚ÄúSir, would you mind holding my baby?‚Äù ¬† Please see earlier post On Philanthropy ‚Äì Giving Money Away [1] Which as I wrote before is the best.school.ever and everyone should know about it.¬† It‚Äôs called the Armand Hammer United World College.¬† Check it out.¬† Heck, if you found this blog post useful, you should donate to the cause!¬† See how easy that was?

Twitter.com/nelliediamondThe New York Times' Andrew Ross Sorkin has a great read today on former Barclays CEO Bob Diamond.† Last summer, Diamond resigned from Barclays top post amid the LIBOR rigging scandal.† One of the memorable moments of that day was when his daughter Nell, who is a prolific Tweeter, Tweeted†at British politicians telling them to #hmd.†(a.k.a. "hold my d***"). Diamond told Sorkin that he thought that was "so nice."† From the NYTimes:† She immediately called her father. ìëDad, I think I did something really bad. I think Iím in trouble,íî Diamond recalled her saying. He told her: ìSweetie, I love you. Thatís so nice. I think weíre probably all in trouble.î Nell left her job at†Deutsche Bank last summer,†Business Insider first reported. Nell, who graduated from†Princeton University, worked in Institutional Rate Sales. We were told by insiders that she stood out at the firm because of her Christian Louboutin red soles.
(nz)dave / FlickrThe jobless claims number is out and it's good. Initial claims of 324K is far better than the expected 345K. It's also a nice drop from last month. Generally the data has been mediocre lately, but the lack of weakness on the weekly initial jobless claims front is really nice to see. This is the best weekly number since January 2008.
Here's your happy thought of the day from SocGen strategist Albert Edwards: Over the last 15 years most investors have refused to contemplate that events in the West are playing out in a similar fashion to Japan in the 1990s. But the latest inflation data out of both the US and eurozone should ram home the fact that we are now only one short recession away from Japanese-style outright deflation. Similarly, investors refuse to believe that equities can fall in an environment of rampant QE. They are wrong. Basically, we're so close to deflation, that all it will take is another downturn, and we'll be toast. SocGen So is another recession on deck? Edwards says yes, and he says that "Dr. Copper" is declaring the party's over. SocGen So yes, deflation, Japan, falling stocks, and recession. This is why people love Albert Edwards.

Leo Reynolds / FlickrVia Calculated Risk, here are the two big numbers that are coming out in the US today: ‚Ä¢ At 8:30 AM ET: the initial weekly unemployment claims report will be released. The consensus is for claims to increase to 345 thousand from 339 thousand last week.¬† ‚Ä¢ Also at 8:30 AM, the Trade Balance report for March from the Census Bureau. The consensus is for the U.S. trade deficit to decrease to $42.4 billion in March from $43.0 billion in February.¬† Also at 8:30 AM we get the ECB press conference, where Mario Draghi may announce new measures to supply credit to firms in the periphery. So this will make for some big minutes right around them.
Jim D. Woodward / FlickrToday we got PMI (manufacturing) readings from various Eurozone countries, and they were all terrible. The numbers weren't necessarily worse than last month, but just objectively bad. Within the surveys, in addition to bad trends on orders and output, there was another common theme. Here's a line form the Italian survey: "Steepest decrease in input prices for close to four years" And from the French one: "Sharpest fall in input prices since July 2012" Germany: "Sharpest drop in input costs since August 2009." Spain: "Input costs fall further as raw material prices decline" You get the picture. The ECB tends not to be eager to act, even when data is bad. But price stability and combating deflation is clearly part of its job. When every country is seeing these steep price falls, the likes of which haven't been seen for years, it's time for them to step up.

It's fallen far below previous lows on these charts. FRED ¬† (Thanks to Bill McBride for pointing out the decline in inflation adjusted construction spending)
Lately I've just been ignoring the Doomers. They've been so wrong for so long that it just isn't worth the time to debunk their periodic Pastisches of Pessimism (tm) in which they prove that they can string together a random assemblage of graphs going down. The canard that the stock market has become divorced from reality, though, has recently been bubbling up in the fevered Doomer imagination in multiple places and hasn't been given a good spanking, so I guess it's time for a little intellectual discipline.  The stock market is and has been for decades one of the components of the Leading Economic Indicators. It isn't perfect - no indicator is - but it almost always makes a peak and a trough, respectively, before the economy as a whole. For example, most recently it peaked in early Ocober 2007 and bottomed in March 2009 2 months and 3 months, respectively, before the economy as a whole.  In the last couple of months, the stock market has made new highs while the economy has been just shambling along, and consumer savings have been stretched to make up for the payroll tax increase. Why is that?  To simplify - actually oversimplifying some - investors in the stock market in the aggregate try to measure the near term outlook for the profitability of the companies in which they trade. the belief is that if profits go up, so will the stock price and in some cases the dividends paid as well.  And boy, have profits gone up! The below graph compares corporate profits after tax (blue) with the S &amp; P 500 stock index (red), with both normed to a value of 100 in 1957: FRED Let's start with the 1987 stock market crash. Notice in the graph that the crash brought profits and stock prices right back in line to their 1957 parity. Then for 10 years corporate profits.boomed, even moreso than the stock market. But beginning in 1997 the stock market entered a bubble, where corporate profits leveled off and even declined slightly, but the stock market continued to boom with the dot com craze.  Notice that since the ensuing crash, stock prices, while broadly correlating with corporate profits, never again reached parity with their 1957 level. Rather, since March 2009 the stock market has gained about 125% - and so have corporate profits, which by far are at all time highs, and have been at new highs for almost three years.  Another way to measure this is to look at the p/e or price-to-earnings ratio. This measures how much buyers of stock are willing to pay for a dollar of earnings (a good layperson's comparison is to think of how much a home buyer is willing to pay per square foot of a house. The higher the price per square foot, the more expensive the house). One year ago, the Dow Jones Industrials had a p/e of 14.68. They ended last week at 15.73. This is not much above their long term average. By contrast, in 1929 their p/e was over 18 and at the height of the dot com bubble it was over 20.  So could the stock market decline tomorrow? Of course! But it's worth noting that in the graph above you can see that corporate profits (the blue line) tend to peak well before stock prices (the red line). In fact corporate profits are a recognized long leading indicator, which means they usually peak at least a year before the economy as a whole.  None of anything I've said above is cheer leading for the economy. Corporate profits may be booming, but real wages actually declined in the last couple of years. They've rebounded in the last couple of months, but as I pointed out yesterday, we now have the lowest personal savings rate since before the 2008 recession.  So while stock prices are firmly in line with the reality of corporate profit growth, they don't measure what is happening with wages and income for average Americans. In fact the biggest economic problem is precisely that those productivity gains are barely being shared with workers at all.  If my word isn't good enough for you, maybe you should point the Doomers to this highly recommended Daily Kos diary by Ministry of Truth from three weeks ago, the title of which is Corporate profits just hit an all time high BECAUSE wages just hit an all time low. That diary isn't incorrect at all. The stock market's problem isn't that it is divorced from reality. It is that it is reflecting reality all too well.
European Parliament / FlickrUS futures are higher after yesterday's solid drop, but mostly markets are going nowhere. Germany is up a bit. Italy and France are down a bit. It's a big day for Europe. Already we've got all of the various PMI (manufacturing) report from April, and they're universally terrible. They might be slightly less worse on the whole than last month, or what was expected, but Germany actually got worse than last month, and that's the region's strongest economy. The other big event coming up later today is the ECB meeting. There will be a decision at 7:45 ET, and then a press conference at 8:30 AM ET. The expectation for Europe is that we'll get a rate cut, but as Lorcan Roche Kelly of Trend Macrolytics has argued, if the ECB is going to do anything effective, it needs to open credit channels for Small and Medium Sized Enterprises, as the current monetary policy transmission mechanism is busted. So what Draghi does on that front is the big question. We'll be covering it all LIVE.
Iím not sure if this counts as one those healthcare ìglitches and bumps,î President Obama talked about the other day. But whatever term you choose, itís hardly a good harbinger for Obamacare and its dramatic Medicaid expansion. New results from the Oregon Health Study ó a ìlandmark studyî in the words of The New York Times ñ†comparing thousands of low-income people in Oregon who received Medicaid access with those who didnít found that ìMedicaid coverage generated no significant improvements in measured physical health outcomes in the first 2 years, but it did increase use of health care services, raise rates of diabetes detection and management, lower rates of depression, and reduce financial strain.î ìItís disappointing,î Zeke Emanuel, a former Obama health policy adviser, told The Washington Post. Letís be clear: A†randomized control study ó what the NYTimes calls ìthe gold standard in medical and scientific researchî ó found that the program responsible for half of Obamacareís insurance coverage expansion (at the cost of $1 trillion) didnít make people healthier in a key ways. More: ìWe found no significant effect of Medicaid coverage on the prevalence or diagnosis of hypertension or high cholesterol levels or on the use of medication for these conditions.î†(Even worse, a preliminary version of this study was used by Obamacare proponents to argue for states expanding Medicaid.) Again, the Medicaid expansion is, in the words of the Center for American Progress, ìa†centerpiece of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.î And it doesnít appear to make people healthier in the way proponents had hoped. Oh, the Medicaid recipients used more healthcare services and felt happier and experienced less financial hardship. Not insignificant impacts ó but these were not the big healthcare selling points by Obamacrats.†Itís like returning a lemon to an autodealer and having the sales guy talk up the carís great air conditioning and the sound system. The researchers running the study are talking up those positive results, but that is just a game effort to turn lemons into lemonade A few other observations: 1. This is not the first time something like this has happened. During the run up to the healthcare battle, Team Obama argue that reform could cut $700 billion from US healthcare spending ó a claim based on a study that later came under fire. 2.†So if Medicaid spending doesnít boost health outcomes, how can Paul Ryanís Medicaid block-granting ìcutsî hurt health outcomes? 3. Health economists†Aaron Carroll and Austin Frakt argue that the study didnít ìshow†that Medicaid harms people, or that the ACA is a failure, or that anything supporters of Medicaid have said is a lie. Moreover, it certainly didnít show that private insurance or Medicare succeeds in ways that Medicaid fails.î No, but perhaps itís time for another controlled study, one on the best ways to help low-income people get the healthcare services they need. And maybe that involve less government and more choice and competition and personal responsibility.
The Eurozone's PMI manufacturing reports for April are out and it's clear that the economy remains in deep depression. The good news is that in many countries things imploded at a less-worse rate than they did the month before. The bad news is that manufacturing is still shrinking very rapidly, and the signs are minimal that things are going to turn around. All of the reports can be found on this page, but here's the quick rundown. Italian PMI rose slightly to 45.5, up from 44.5 last month. But that's still far below 50, and it makes 21 months of economic contraction. Spanish PMI again rose slightly, from 44.2 to 44.7, hardly anything to get excited about. French PMI rose to a 4-month high of.... 44.4. Bad. The German situation actually got even worse, falling from 49.0 to 48.1. A distressing number came yesterday from Ireland, which clocked in at 48.0, down from 48.6. Ireland is supposed to be one of Europe's strong recovery countries. For more PMI readings from around the world, see here ---&gt; And finally Eurozone total PMI hit a four month low of 46.7.
There's been a meme going around that in recent months, the Greek economy is showing its first signs of modest healing. It's still in a horrendous, depression state that will scar the country for years. But budget balances have been improving, and the economic data has been getting less and less horrible. And today's PMI manufacturing report has what looks like green shoots. The index rose from 42.1 to 45.0, which is a huge month on month jump. This also happens to be the strongest month in 21 months.

Flickr/Mr. T in DCHEADS UP: The world's biggest economies have their April manufacturing PMI reports. And this is our scorecard. And the reports reflect a global deceleration. China's official manufacturing PMI report slipped to 50.6 from 50.9 in March.¬† China's unofficial HSBC PMI fell to 50.4 from 51.6. In the U.S., the ISM and PMI manufacturing reports each fell. However, the Chinese and U.S. numbers all remain above 50.0, which indicates expansion. In Europe, Spain, Italy, France and Greece all posted modest increases in their PMIs.¬† However, they are all in contractionary territory. The big story out of Europe is certainly Germany, whose PMI tumbled sharply into contractionary territory. PMI At the beginning of each month, Markit, HSBC, RBC, JP Morgan and several other major data gathering institutions publish the latest local readings of the manufacturing¬†purchasing managers index (PMI) for countries around the world. PMI is one of the best leading indicators of the economy.¬† Each reading is based on surveys of hundreds of companies. Read more about it at Markit. These are not the most closely followed data points.¬† However, the power of the insights is unparalleled. Jim O'Neill, the former Goldman Sachs economist, believes the PMI numbers are among the most reliable economic indicators in the world.¬† BlackRock's Russ Koesterich thinks it's one of the most underrated indicators. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- April 29, April 30 (All Times EDT) April 30, May 1 May 1, May 2
There's no doubt now that Germany is succumbing to the weak economy. There have been hits of this happening for awhile now, but today's PMI reading, which is a gauge of the country's manufacturing sector, confirms it. April PMI for Germany came in at 48.1, which is down from 49.0 last month. Anything below 50 is contraction. What's worse, there was a reduction in staffing levels, and total manufacturing output had its first drop all year. Here's a quick summary. Markit
French manufacturing had its best month in 4 months. And it's still totally dismal. The country's PMI index rose to 44.4, from 44. Unfortunately, anything below 50 is contraction, so this is very steep contraction. Via Markit, here's a summary. Markit
Ever since the economic growth in the USA fell back below 2% on a year-over-year basis, which was in early 2011, there has been talk of below stall speed (the speed, below which an airplane losses lift and falls down to earth) growth and an unavoidable recession. With good reason: Since WWII every time year-over-year growth in the US had fallen below 2%, a recession followed in due course. Well, until now. The recession is now almost 2 years late and still it has not arrived. Why? Perhaps the sub-2% growth is just not sub-stall speed anymore. Rather it could be actually already above the potential growth rate that people have been waiting for since the Great Recession. Yes,as strange as it sounds, the 1.8% year-over-year growth in real GDP in Q1 2013 (illustrated¬†here) might be the best we can expect ... for perhaps the next 10 years. The cause may not be the debt crisis and the deleveraging process, but rather simple demographics. The reason why a recession always followed when growth fell below 2% is probably because the unemployment rate only fell when growth was above 2%. This has been the case since the Department of Labor began tracking the data in 1948, with two notable exceptions: the last 2 years! Advisor Perspectives ¬† Click for a larger image Now why is that? Blame (or thank) the baby boomers. Advisor Perspectives¬† Click for a larger image In the chart above, the unemployment rate (red line, inverted, so rising line means falling unemployment) can be calculated as: One minus the employment population ratio (blue line) divided by the labor force participation rate (green line) The decline in the unemployment rate that started in 2009 was primarily the result of shrinkage in the labor force participation rate (the green line) rather than growth of new jobs relative to the population (the blue line). Now this trend is usually blamed on people just giving up looking for a job. But I would argue that the speed of the decline in the fourth year of an expansion can't be simply blamed on that and is rather unusual in the long run. Instead, I would argue that the trend is to a large degree a result of demographics. Have a look at the birth rate:Advisor Perspectives Click for a sharper image As you can see, the drop in the birth rate in the mid-1930s during the Great Depression very well corresponded with the top of the labor force 65 years later (the usual US retirement age being 65) at around the turn of the millennium, a time that by some measures could be seen as the peak of the US economy in general, before a decade packed with an unusually high degree of financial and market crises. The baby boom began in 1946, with a sharp top in the chart in 1947, but it wasn't until 1958 that the rate started to fall. Guess what happened 65 years after the 1946-1947 boom, in 2011-2012. For a hint, please see above. The answer for me is one that seems quite unbelievable at first glance: The US is not growing below stall speed, rather it is growing above potential. If the unemployment rate is falling 0.7 percentage points with the year-over-year GDP at 1.8%, the growth rate at which the unemployment rate is stable (which will be the long-run equilibrium) in the coming 10 years must be much smaller than 1.8%. (Perhaps not even positive? Well, just a thought.) Now you could argue that there is a lot of slack in the US economy, so that the growth could be much higher for some time -- until the recovery has erased the underutilization in the economy.
