Markit / HSBCChina's HSBC manufacturing PMI climbed to 50.9 in October from 50.2 in September. This was a bit higher than the 50.7 expected by economists. Here are the key points from Markit: From HSBC's Hongbin Qu: The final HSBC China Manufacturing PMI rose to a seven-month high in October, with the stronger momentum of manufacturing growth translating into the first expansion of employment since March. This in turn should support private consumption growth in the coming months. China is on track for a gradual growth recovery. Earlier today, we learned that the official PMI number beat expectations, jumping to 51.4.
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Fannie Mae sued nine of the world's largest banks on Thursday, accusing them of colluding to manipulate interest rates and seeking more than $800 million of damages. In a complaint filed in theÂ U.S. District CourtÂ in Manhattan, the government-controlled mortgage company accused the banks of conspiring for many years to suppress Libor, or theÂ London InterbankÂ Offered Rate, including during the 2008 financial crisis. Libor underpins hundreds of trillions of dollars of transactions, and is used to set interest rates on such things as credit cards, student loans and mortgages. But according to Thursday's 71-page lawsuit, "defendants' promises and representations regarding the legitimacy of Libor were false," causing Fannie Mae to lose money on swaps, mortgages, mortgage securities and other transactions. The lawsuit adds to the legal headaches over whether banks manipulated Libor and other rate benchmarks to boost profit or appear healthier than they actually were. Regulators in theÂ United States,Â EuropeÂ andÂ AsiaÂ have been investigating many banks over alleged manipulation of Libor and other rate benchmarks. Four banks sued by Fannie Mae -Â BarclaysÂ Plc, Rabobank,Â Royal Bank of Scotland Group PlcÂ and UBS AG - have reached regulatory settlements that totaled $3.6 billion and included admissions of wrongdoing. The scandal also cost the jobs ofÂ Barclays' and Rabobank's respective chief executives, Robert Diamond andÂ Piet Moerland. Other bank defendants in the Fannie Mae lawsuit are Bank of America Corp, Citigroup Inc, Credit Suisse Group AG,Â Deutsche Bank AGÂ andÂ JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. All nine banks declined to comment. Freddie Mac, another government-controlled mortgage company, filed a similar lawsuit in March seeking unspecified damages from more than one dozen banks. SEEKING FAVORS The Fannie Mae lawsuit describes emails and other communications that illustrate the alleged collusion. In one instance, a rate submitter at Rabobank is quoted as having admitted to have "always used to ask if anyone needed a favor and vice versa ... a little unethical but always helps to have friends in (the market)." According to the complaint, the banks' Libor submissions were "particularly striking" on days where they settled large swap positions with Fannie Mae. The company estimated that it lost $332 million on interest-rate swaps alone. "Fannie Mae filed this action to recover losses it suffered as a result of the defendants' manipulation of Libor," a spokesman said. "We have a responsibility to be good stewards of our resources." TheÂ U.S. governmentÂ bailed out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2008. Both companies are now overseen by theÂ Federal Housing Finance AgencyÂ (FHFA), which tries to conserve and recover assets for the benefit of taxpayers. In 2011, the FHFA sued 18 banks and financial companies to recover losses that it said Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac suffered on about $200 billion of mortgage securities. JPMorgan last week became the fourth defendant to settle in that litigation, agreeing to pay $4 billion. Fannie Mae's lawyers include Kathy Patrick, a partner at Gibbs &amp; Bruns who also represents investors that negotiated an $8.5 billion settlement with Bank of America over mortgage securities from the formerÂ Countrywide Financial Corp. Patrick declined to comment on the Fannie Mae lawsuit. Shares of Fannie Mae closed up 13 cents at $2.34. The case is FederalÂ National Mortgage Association v. Barclays BankÂ Plc et al,Â U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 13-07720.

Societe GeneraleChina's National Bureau of Statistics published the country's official manufacturing PMI report a bit earlier than expected. The headline number climbed to 51.4 in October from 51.1 in September. Economists were looking for a reading of 51.2. Any reading above 50 signals growth. The output sub-index was particularly strong, rising to 54.4 from 52.9. It's worth noting, however, that seven of the 12 sub-indexes actually contracted. Here's a breakdown of the September report.
It's "PMI Day," when reports come out for countries around the world about the health of their manufacturing sectors for October. What happened to the U.S. economy in October is a crucial question, since A) The economy may have already started slowing going into the month and B) we had the government shutdown/debt ceiling crisis. So how much of a setback will we have seen? On Thursday we got a weird clue. The Chicago PMI report, which measures the strength of the manufacturing sector in the Chicago region came in ridiculously strong. The surge was the fastest pace in over 30 years, with strong gains in new orders and total output. Tomorrow we get the national ISM report. Analysts expect a reading of 55.0, down a bit from 56.2. For some further context on this and today's strong Chicago number, here's Mike O'Rourke of JonesTrading: The larger question is how much faith investors should have in this report.  As we noted earlier, it seems too good to believe especially considering the Government shutdown.  On the positive side, the Milwaukee PMI was also strong, posting its best reading in nearly a year and a half.  Both of these reports bode well for the more important ISM Manufacturing report, which will be released tomorrow.  The challenge is that these reports have held little sway with the Fed and their improving strength throughout the summer has not materialized into payroll gains. As we have noted in the past, these purchasing manager surveys are sentiment surveys and referred to as “soft” data as opposed to the hard data like payrolls, retail sales, etc.  As we look forward to tomorrow’s ISM, a good report will be a welcome development but we do not expect it to influence Fed policy.  That being said, we do expect it to reinforce the trend we witnessed today.  On the other hand, a weak number will only reinforce the expectation that tapering is a late Q1- early Q2 2014 event.  For more on today's Chicago PMI, see here »
REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji Red Bull Formula One driver Sebastian Vettel of Germany raises his fist after winning the Korean F1 Grand Prix at the Korea International Circuit in Yeongam, October 6, 2013.The October South Korean trade figures are out. Exports surged 7.3% year-over-year, which was much stronger than the 2.3% increase expected. This bodes well for the upcoming economic data out of China and the rest of emerging Asia. Korean trade data is extremely sensitive to the economic activity in developed and emerging Asia. It usually comes before the first trading session of the month in Asia, which makes it the first of the world's major economic indicators to be released. "Both export and imports should jump significantly from the previous month in October," said Societe Generale's Suktae Oh ahead of the report. "This may be considered as evidence of stronger economic activity at a first sight," warned Oh. "But we prefer to be more cautious on interpretation: it is more likely to represent a return to a normal level after the temporary weakness caused by the summer season and Chuseok holidays." Still, it's worth noting the actual numbers exceeded Oh's estimates. Societe Generale

Because Chinese banks have financed much of this local debt through short-term loans, concerns about local government solvency are also raising questions about the integrity of the Chinese financial system—including, apparently, in Beijing. In a note last month entitled, “Fiscal Reform Could Be a Major Focus,” Credit Suisse’s Head of China Research Vincent Chan said the Chinese government will likely announce at an important Communist Party gathering next month a number of reforms intended to curb local spending. Chief among them: new permission for local governments to issue municipal bonds. While on the surface, that may sound like a way to encourage more borrowing, not less, the real intent of such a move would be to keep provinces and municipalities on a tighter leash by making their financial obligations more transparent. A comprehensive audit of local government debt, which Chinese officials ordered in July, should soon reveal just how much China’s provinces and towns are in hock. Credit Suisse estimates the figure could exceed 17 trillion yuan ($2.8 trillion) – more than one-third the size of the Chinese economy. If that estimate is correct, it would mark a nearly 60 percent increase since 2010, when China’s National Audit Office estimated the total at 10.7 trillion yuan ($1.7 trillion). That, in turn, was nearly double the 5.6 trillion yuan ($920 billion) debt load of 2008, right before the central government unleashed a massive stimulus program in 2009 to stave off the global financial crisis. Local debt is not just a local problem. China’s overall credit-to-GDP ratio has soared to more than 180 percent from just 120 percent in 2009, with much of that new borrowing being done by special financing vehicles created to fund local government projects. The making of those loans, Chan said, became a “key business” for Chinese banks. Making matters worse, as Credit Suisse China economists Dong Tao and Weishen Deng pointed out in a late September report entitled, “China: Waiting for Reform Signals,” “many of (the local government) investment projects are commercially unviable, funded-by short-term debt, through trust funds, corporate bonds and wealth management products.” Investors have shown their concern by marking down the stocks of Chinese banks, the price-to-book values of which have fallen dramatically since 2007. “The sharp rise in the credit-to-GDP ratio [is] a key reason behind the de-rating of the China market, particularly the Chinese financials, in recent years,“ Chan wrote. China certainly isn’t the only country where local governments have bitten off more than they can chew. Consider the United States. A study by the St. Louis Fed last year examined the liabilities of eight U.S. states, combining state and local debt with unfunded pension and health care obligations owed to retired public employees. The most frugal state in that study—Tennessee—showed a debt load of about 17 percent of its economy, whereas the most spendthrift, Kentucky, topped 41 percent. Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory whose municipal bonds are widely held, has seen its debt downgraded to just above junk status, and earlier this year, Detroit became the first major U.S. city to declare bankruptcy. U.S. residents can take some comfort in a better, albeit still not entirely transparent, understanding of what their governments owe, and to whom. One reason the same information is difficult to get in China is that Chinese provinces and towns aren’t supposed to borrow money at all. Chan pointed out that local entities account for about 85 percent of total government spending, even though the central government allocates them just 52 percent of the country’s total revenues. Since they can’t issue bonds, local officials have set up thousands of so-called local government financing vehicles (LGFVs) to borrow on their behalf. These entities use the money made from selling land-use rights to developers as collateral for loans from banks or lightly regulated trusts. Such a system can work just fine in a booming economy, but it gets worrisome in a slowing one. In the end, the argument for creating a municipal bond system to bring local borrowing under control is a little bit like the one for legalizing drugs: Allowing a previously forbidden activity to take place out in the open, while strictly regulating it, should keep it under better control than letting it proceed in the shadows. Both local legislatures and the central government’s Ministry of Finance will likely have to approve future bond issues, Chan said, with only provinces and perhaps the 15 largest cities allowed to borrow. And when they do so, they’ll likely have to reveal much more detailed financial information than has been required of them to date. Chan also believes the Chinese central government might try to shore up local finances by taking over some of the health care, education and social security spending for which local governments are currently responsible. But what of the rest of the country’s nearly innumerable municipal locales, including even small villages that already have loans on their books? With no clear path to borrowing money in the future, they will surely have to cut down on infrastructure spending. That, Chan pointed out, “would not be very good news for the commodities and capital goods sectors” that are fueled by such local development projects. The reforms Chinese leaders could introduce next month would go a long way to reassuring investors about the health of the financial system. That’s not to say they won’t hurt in the short-term, as loan growth would undoubtedly slow at Chinese banks if LGFVs disappeared. But in the end, Chan argued, investors will likely be happy to forsake a little growth in exchange for a less leveraged future. “Banks are likely to be turned into slower-growth institutions after this reform,” but would also probably have safer balance sheets, Chan wrote. “If local government borrowing can be more adequately controlled, and China’s credit-to-GDP ratio becomes more stable, it would help to improve the market perception of the risk of China’s financial system.”
Scott Olson/Getty ImagesBuried in a Pew Research survey released earlier this year is an interesting tidbit: Millennials (people born between the early 1980s and the early 2000s) hold a much more favorable view of labor unions than do older Americans. The statistic presents a bit of a paradox because young people are, far and away, the least likely age group to be members of a union. If Millennials are such staunch supporters of unions, why aren't they actually joining them? "I think the reason Millennials tend to be positive on union is that they're what's called a 'civic generation,'" explained Michael Hais, co-author of the book Millennial Momentum: How a New Generation Is Remaking America. "They are very group-oriented and look out for the benefit of the group over individuals. They have an ingrained sense of equality and want to find win-win situations that benefit large groups of people." Hais asserts that civic generations, another example of which is the so-called "Greatest Generation," are strongly influenced by economic and foreign policy stressors during their formative years. For the Greatest Generation, those experiences were the Great Depression and WWII. For their part, Millennials were similarly shaped by the high unemployment rates of the Great Recession and 9/11 attacks. "Growing up in the shadow of these events gave Millennials the conviction that everyone needs to pull together to get through," argued Hais. The poll, which was conducted in July, found that 61% of respondents aged 18 to 29 held a favorable view of labor unions, while only 45% viewed such organizations negatively. In all other age groups, support for unions never rose above 50%. Positive opinions about unions generally dropped as people got older, bottoming out with only 42% of people 65 and over holding a supportive opinion of organized labor. Conversely, according to figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, only a small fraction of Millennials have actually joined a union. Just 5% of Americans between the ages of 16 and 24 are union members. That number increases to 10.7% for people between the ages of 25 and 35; however, those rates are still the lowest of any other age cohort. Dr. Diane Frey, an assistant professor of labor studies at the National Labor College, says the primary reason for Millennials' low union participation rate isn't that young people are making the active choice to avoid signing up. Instead, she insisted, most simply do not have the option. Ethan Miller/Getty ImagesUnion workers picket outside The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas on June 14, 2013. The demonstration was in response to stalled negotiations with the hotel-casino, where 2,000 members of the Culinary Workers Union have been without a contract for more than two years. As the American economy has become largely post-industrial, fewer private sector jobs are unionized. <U+201F>Some of the really decent professions that have in the past been good entry ways for new generations of workers, such as public sector teaching, are being dismantled with new disposable models where younger workers are basically sweated in programs like Teach-for-America that are not meant to be sustainable as careers," she says. Rates of union membership are significantly higher in the public sector than in the private firms (35% vs. 6%, respectively). The average age of public sector employees is also far higher. U.S. Postal Service workers, for example, have a median age of 52. This greying of the government workforce is largely a result of the economic slowdown having pushed many older workers to delay retirement — thereby decreasing the number of open slots for Millennials. Additionally, shrinking governmental budgets, combined with the shrinking effects of the sequester, have initiated years of layoffs and hiring freezes at agencies around the country. As such, municipalities have often eliminated the entry-level positions that could set Millennials off on unionized careers in government service. Tim McManus of the nonprofit Partnership for Public Service told Governing Magazine that he's seen a dramatic reduction in the number of paid summer internships offered by governmental agencies. He added that, even though some parts of the government have started to hire staff again, <U+201F>they tend to hire veterans who can hit the ground running," instead of fresh-faced young people just getting their start in the labor force. Bill Pugliano/Getty ImagesUnion members hold a sit-in in the rotunda of the Michigan State Capitol to protest a vote on Right-to-Work legislation December 11, 2012 in Lansing, Michigan.Ironically, this locking out of many Millennials from likely unionized public sector careers comes at a time when college students' interest in working for the government is on the rise. The number of enrollees in graduate programs for public administration grew by 5% in 2012, a significantly larger increase than for business programs. Another reason for the low membership rate is a changing conception of what a <U+201F>normal" career is supposed to look like. During the heyday of the labor movement, there was the assumption that someone could remain employed at the same company for his or her entire working life. For Millennials, who, on average, will hold seven different jobs by the time they hit 26, the idea of staying at single firm in a single industry represented by a single union can seem almost laughably antiquated. While union membership among Millennials is low, it is by no means non-existent. Ashley Mahne, an immunologist who recently became a post-doctoral researcher at the University of California, San Francisco, never envisioned herself as a union member before being asked if she wanted to join on after starting her new position at the university earlier this month. <U+201F>Given their level of education and expertise, I feel post-docs are generally underpaid and under-appreciated, so if organizing together could give us a little more clout, I think that would be a good thing," explained Mahne, who noted that dues would have been deducted from her paycheck even if she declined membership. Bill Pugliano/Getty Images Mahne was personally ambivalent about unions prior to joining one herself. <U+201F>Historically, they've been critical to securing protections and fair wages for laborers," she said, <U+201F>but in the present day, they sometimes appear to be more obstructionist than helpful." However, it was a quotation at the bottom of the membership form by Albert Einstein, who was a charter member of his union at Princeton, that ultimately swayed Mahne to sign up: <U+201F>I consider it important, indeed urgently necessary, for intellectual workers to get together, both to protect their own economic status and also, generally speaking, to secure their influence in the political field." <U+201F>I mean, if Einstein says it's a good idea," said Mahne, <U+201F>who am I to argue?"
SouthwestStandard and Poor's said the government shutdown and fight over the debt ceiling cost the economy $24 billion.Â  That wasn't just from zookeepers at the National Zoo getting laid off. Nor was it from delays to just government contractors.Â  With the help of SeekingAlpha's library of earnings call transcripts, we found 11 companies with very little direct government-related business who said the shutdown has impacted their. "Thus far, in October, we were impacted by theÂ government shutdown. We're currently estimating about a $20 million impact from a reduction in government-related travel, and our best guess at this point is that October [Passenger Revenue per Available Seat Mile]Â will be up about 1 percentage point." "the shutdown affected both business and leisure demand, though the effects were most pronounced for business demand. For the last week of September and the first 2 weeks of October, close-in bookings were down by 12% and total bookings were down 8%."Â  "One of the factors impacting demand in DeVry University as well as higher education across the U.S. continues to be prospective students' lack of confidence in the job market and hesitancy to make the commitment to go to college. The recent government shutdown didn't help. We saw a downturn in Internet searches across education and in our own inquiries within days of the shutdown announcement, many students worried that federal aid might be stopped and indicated they were going to wait until the uncertainty clear up. "And put yourself in the shoes of a single mother who is thinking about enrolling in college or a government worker on a furlough or a military student. With the shutdown, you worried that federal aid might not be there. And this becomes one more reason to potentially put off the decision to go to college." "...our DIY business definitely slowed down towards the end of the quarter more -- pretty dramatically. ... this whole government shutdown and the bickering that's been going on in Washington, was going on, I think has informed, as most people are these days, because of the news agencies and smartphones and all that kind of stuff.  "I think it creates uncertainty, especially when people are living paycheck to paycheck and we're talking about defaulting on our sovereign debt and all the things that are discussed on TV and news agencies. So a lot of people don't really understand. They just think it's bad and can't be good for them." "...there's no question that the government shutdown had a disruptive impact on sales. Business was very strong from all this going through Labor Day. And once the prospect of a government shutdown became more certain, it definitely was disruptive to sales. I would -- if I were to describe it, I would say, sequentially, it was about a 10% impact, and year-over-year you are then running flat rather than having increases. That phenomenon continued into October."Â  "Doubletree Bethesda continued cutbacks in government travel and the government shutdown which affected bookings in September, negatively impacted margins 18 basis points."Â  "At the end of Q3, when the likelihood of government shutdown and debt ceiling crisis became more evident, we saw a market slowdown in sales and replenishment. That continued through the first 3 weeks of October. As a result of our performance, we will accelerate reducing our structural cost in the U.S. to ensure a competitive product offering at the right price point and strong profitability for the business." "The D.C. area was also likely impacted by the uncertainties leading into the government shutdown." "...our September results were also impacted by this shutdown issues in Washington. It carried through the first two weeks in October and now we see people coming back but people are still somewhat cautious however, as our business is not something that you know, that is not high upper end restaurants where if you donâ€™t eat you donâ€™t come back. In our case people do come back." "Sales performance tapered up towards the end of the quarter. The political standoff and government shutdown was likely a factor as many have suggested..." "The Aviation market remains challenging, and this has been further intensified by shutdown-related furloughs at the FAA causing short-term delays in certifications, field approvals and shipments. While this may create headwinds in the fourth quarter, we continue to believe in our long-term growth story in this segment. ... "...any kind of field approval that was occurring with the installation of avionics, aircraft registrations, certifications, all those things are basically shut down for the period that the government was in the shutdown mode. So we saw that as a blip, and the industry is quite sensitive. So we don't know, as we roll into Q4, what the impact of ongoing budget talks will be as we move towards the end of the year. So we're maintaining kind of a conservative outlook there."

Investors Chasing Income Are Turning To A Strategy That Could Eventually 'Dent' Their Portfolio (The Wall Street Journal)  Inexperienced investors have been trying to use a strategy called "covered call writing" to generate income, writes Murray Coleman of the Wall Street Journal. "The way such a strategy works is fairly straightforward: An investor buys a stock and then sells a call option, or the obligation to sell the stock at a certain "strike price" within a specific time frame." The idea is that if the stock price falls they keep the premium but if it rises then the seller's gains are capped. Advisors are warning against the practice, especially if they're using it to pay for their expenses. Philip Guziec, a Morningstar analyst tells Coleman that this could "dent" an the long-term returns on an investors portfolio. "Too many people sell covered calls to generate extra income to live on, not realizing how severely that type of a strategy can eat into a portfolio's upside over time," Guziec told the WSJ.

Why CAPE-Toting, Market-Crash Fear Mongers With A 5-Point Takedown (Jefferies)  With stocks near new all-time highs, the cyclically-adjusted price-earnings (CAPE) ratio, is up to 24 times. Some have looked at this and argued that the odds of a crash have increased. But Jefferies' Sean Darby doesn't think this is the case for five key reasons.Â  1. The S&amp;P is a market cap weighted index and profits will "profits will likely be skewed unequally relative to the value of the company." 2. "A number of US companies have large cash holdings which if stripped out would lower the absolute PE multiple." 3. "The Shiller CAPE is based on two variables just like many other stock valuation models. Hence it could be that profits are too low and that they should mean revert upwards. This would make the CAPE appear cheap." 4. "Other measures of price to profits suggest that stocks are not necessarily expensive." 5. "The â€˜averageâ€™ that is highlighted today will be different ten years."

REUTERS/Kim Kyung-HoonFederal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke.The absence of a nod to the effects of the recent government shutdown â€” and the ongoing fiscal crisis in Washington, D.C. â€” in yesterday's October FOMC statement is causing a wholesale re-think across Wall Street about when the Federal Reserve is most likely to begin tapering down its quantitative easing program. The big question left unanswered by this omission from the statement is this: how does the fiscal crisis factor into the FOMC's assessment of the economic outlook? Before yesterday, economists and strategists believed the most likely timing for a tapering announcement was the FOMC's March meeting. The rationale was that the Fed had cited both inadequate improvement in the economic data and the upcoming fiscal storm in D.C. as reasons for refraining from tapering in September. On the first point, no one really expected there to be enough incremental data in the next few months to suggest an inflection point economic growth. Meanwhile, D.C. agreed to simply postpone the budget and debt ceiling fights to January and February, respectively, meaning we could get a repeat of the October episode fairly soon, with more downside risks to the economy. So, not only did most expect tapering to be off the table until March, but some were worried that it could be even further off than that. "There is a danger that the Fed has missed its window of opportunity," said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics, in a note to clients last week. "If it's waiting for some degree of fiscal certainty, this really could turn into QEternity." Likewise, George Goncalves, managing director and head of rates research at Nomura, asserted prior to yesterday's meeting that a fiscal "Grand Bargain" was "the only way to eventually fully get off the Fed QE crutch." In fact, the general consensus on the Street prior to the release of yesterday's statement was that the FOMC would confirm the views of market participants that tapering was off the table for a few months by tweaking the language of the statement to acknowledge the fiscal crisis â€” but that didn't happen, and now, market expectations for the beginning of the end of QE are being pulled forward. "In terms of the actual tapering path that the market believes, we are far from the early September path," says Steven Englander, global head of G-10 FX strategy at Citi. "The biggest concentration of probability now is that tapering begins in the January-March period versus March and beyond two days ago." For his part, Capital Economics' Ashworth believes "sometime early next year is the most likely outcome, but the balance of risks just shifted a little." "If officials are trying to downplay the impact of the shutdown and are happier with the level of long-term interest rates, then perhaps a December taper isn't quite as out of the question as we had previously thought," he writes in reaction to the October FOMC statement. But is that really what the Fed was doing? Nomura's Goncalves is not convinced. "We are perplexed why traders and the media are focusing on the first sentence in the third paragraph [of the October FOMC statement] that addresses their views on the fiscal impact, which was basically a repeat," he writes in a note. "They continue to state that given 'the extent of federal fiscal retrenchment over the past year' they are still viewing QE as a success and that due to their asset purchases it has resulted in improving economic activity and labor market conditions, which are consistent with a growing economy. Granted, by leaving this point basically intact, the market believes they are trying to put a positive spin to their messaging, but can it last?" Goncalves still thinks the answer is no. "They need to continue to sound optimistic â€” got it â€” but to taper they will still need the data to improve and the D.C. fiscal fights to go away, which doesnâ€™t seem likely in our view," he says. We may get some more clarity on how the FOMC views the effects of the shutdown starting Friday, with speeches by St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, Minneapolis Fed president Narayana Kocherlakota, and Richmond Fed president Jeffrey Lacker on the calendar. "What will matter in coming days is how upcoming Fed speakers spin their decision," says Citi's Englander. "Asset markets will come under pressure if they keep repeating that tapering isn't tightening because they have a powerful forward guidance weapon at their disposal. Investors do not believe it. If they stress that the weak data will not make them comfortable with tapering for a good while, risk gets bought again." The release of the statement sent 10-year Treasury yields up as investors sold the bonds in anticipation of a taper sooner rather than later, and today, an unexpected surge in the ISM's monthly Chicago Purchasing Managers Index is sending them higher still â€” not least because ISM said in the report that businesses were "seemingly unaffected by the [government] shutdown." Today, the 10-year yield trades at 2.56%. "Markets are skittish any time the Fed doesnâ€™t validate that the 'carry trade' is a-ok, and that means pushing bond markets â€” [10-year Treasury yields], for example â€” [down] through 2.5% will require weak data &amp; round 3 of fiscal fight," says Goncalves. "Unfortunately, we think itâ€™s coming."
There are many ways to value the stock market. Some analysts will compare its price relative to the size of the local economy. Then they will compare that ratio to its historical averages. Warren Buffett is known to favor market cap as a percentage of GNP. Guggenheim Partners' Scott Minerd examined the market caps of twelve economies' market cap to GDP ratios and charted what they looked like compared to 10-year historical averages. Here's Minerd's commentary: With continued monetary easing around the world and signs of a synchronous global expansion taking root, countries that were particularly hard hit over the past few years now present potentially attractive opportunities. Measured by market capitalization as a percent of GDP, Eastern Europe and smaller euro zone peripheral countries now appear to be the most undervalued of major regions worldwide. Major peripheral countries in the euro zone (Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain) are also below their average level of market cap to GDP over the past 10 years, indicating further room for equity returns, compared to other developed markets. Emerging markets that suffered selloffs over the past few months also remain undervalued, including India, China, and South America. This is not to say the U.S. stock market is doomed. It just means other markets look cheaper. Guggenheim Partners
IMDB / Rambo IIThis is not Jefferies' Sean DarbyNobel Prize-winning economist Robert Shiller made a name for himself when he predicted the dotcom bubble using his now-famous CAPE ratio. CAPE is short for cyclically-adjusted price-earnings ratio. It's calculated by taking the S&amp;P 500 and dividing it by the average of ten years worth of earnings.Â  If the ratio is above the long-term average of around 16, the stock market is considered expensive. Shiller has argued that the CAPE is remarkably good at predicting returns over the period of several years. As the stock market has drifted to all-time highs, prices have outpaced earnings growth and the CAPE his risen to a notable 24 times. Some folks warn that that this means the odds of a crash have risen significantly. Check it out: Jefferies But Jefferies' Sean Darby isn't having this. "There are a number of reasons that investors should be careful relying solely on one valuation model to determine whether the equity market is under or overvalued," said Darby. In a new note to clients, he lays out a five-point takedown of the CAPE-toting crash mongers. From his note (emphasis added): In a nutshell, CAPE doesn't adjust skews, companies have tons of cash, stocks don't have to fall for CAPE to mean-revert, other measures of earnings are more reasonable, and there's hindsight bias. One thing that Darby left out is that the whole principle of CAPE could fall apart. "Things can go for 200 years and then change," warned another CAPE expert. "I even worry about the 10-year P/E â€” even that relationship could break down." That expert: Robert Shiller.
Sharon Meers"So is it fiction?" a male friend asked when I first told him about my book, “Getting to 50/50.” It’s not, I promise.   But men and women sharing power at work and at home, putting equal value on two careers — and equal value on each parent having time with the kids? Well, he has a point: that can sound like a pipe dream.   Yet, we've seen the reality. In our own lives, in social science research, and in countless anecdotes we’ve heard in talking to hundreds of men and women. The reality is this: If women are willing to change the way we perceive our choices — in our careers, marriages, and childrearing — we can have much more of what we want. 50/50 is about practical steps to stay engaged with your family without sacrificing your career.   First, we need to acknowledge that we’ve come a long way, baby, but have a long way to go. This weekend at a book talk, a young woman from Walmart.com told me both how much millennial men are changing things. And how much help we all need to change faster.  “We used to work 80-hour weeks; that was really unsustainable,” she said. “Then lots of us had kids.” She said the guys got more efficient and cut their hours, along with the women. But the big problem: “Most of us grew up in more traditional homes where the mom did everything. We need a different model — where both parents work.”  “It’s a question of not so much pushing the boys out of the picture,” Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said recently, “but making the whole frame bigger so that both men and women access the labor market, contribute to the economy, generate growth, have jobs, and so on.”   Here's the trick: If we build a bigger-picture workplace, one that is truly gender-neutral, women are going to win (jobs, promotions, the directorship of the IMF) 50% of the time. That's new. But then, in addition, men will win a greater role at home. If we could all get comfortable with this — really comfortable, in practice not theory — there is huge upside. For everyone.  The place to start is, perhaps contrarily, at home. Get comfortable sharing roles at home, and parity in the workplace will come faster. Here are four top tips on how to do that, from the 50/50 trenches:  Be unabashedly nosy. When we first got married, my husband and I met a 50/50 couple at a party. She was a technology exec, he a senior lawyer. They had two kids and were warm and amazing. We stalked them all over the party asking way too many personal questions. Surprisingly, they seemed to like it, and they gave us great tips — and great confidence.   When I got pregnant, I invited a woman I barely knew to lunch. She was an investment banker with five kids, her husband a partner at a big consulting firm. I still have notes from the lunch. They became the blueprint for our family. It’s a lot easier to do 50/50 if you dare to learn from those pioneering it.  Skip balance; seek control. “Work-life balance” is a bad catchphrase for what we want. Let’s do as one senior executive at Google does, and call it what it is: “work-life free-for- all.” Happy dual-career families embrace this chaos and try to control only the small number of things that really matter — at home and at work.   Thankfully, as a large Harvard Business School study at Boston Consulting Group shows, if you control time and focus on what matters, that provides far more benefit than the sheer volume of hours you spend at your desk. Top-performing teams create structure to share information and candor about personal commitments. That drives unique levels of cooperation, predictable time off, and better results for clients (and families).   Keep passing the baton. My husband likes to say we’re a family of four alpha males — two of us are female, and our daughter is only 9. All that leading with little instinct for following can make things difficult. Creating fairness takes real effort, whether it’s about who works late, travels for business, or plans the family weekend.   When I worked at Goldman Sachs, we came up with a simple way to think about this. “Don’t take a job you wouldn’t want me to have,” we agreed. Instead, we make deals. How many nights away is OK or too much? How many dinners a week do we need with our kids? On weekends we take turns. When my husband leads, we are punctual and orderly; when it’s my turn, count on more museums and mess in the kitchen.  Sharon MeersWeekly meetings are sexy. Who knew that calendaring could be romantic? Turns out, treating your spouse like a colleague (to an extent) cuts down on misunderstandings and dropped balls. If you can find 30 minutes a week to sit down and look ahead, you avoid a lot of conflict. It’s clear who’s dealing with Monday dinner, who’s picking up the kids when, and who’s planning the summer vacation. When you look at it all calmly, on paper, people tend to do what’s fair. The bonus: When wives perceive things are fair at home, couples have more sex, according to the data.  When one senior partner at a large DC law firm was a young lawyer, he cut back his hours to make room for his kids and be supportive of his wife's career. “It does have a cost,” he says. “The peace of mind you get from doing things like everyone else.”   Ah, and there it is. The data shows only small career costs for people who take control of work hours to make room for family — a couple years in the speed of job progression. But the bigger cost may be the psychological one: The fear of being different. Fear feeds guilt and the sense that husbands and wives happily acting as equals must be fiction.   What we’ve learned is that there are many practical steps to getting rid of this guilt, doing right by our kids by letting go of what doesn’t matter (to focus on what does), and helping men play bigger roles at home so women are free to lead larger lives at work. Strong and successful family life requires nothing less — so does the economy, as even the IMF now says. That’s what 50/50 is all about.  Sharon Meers is the coauthor of "Getting to 50/50: How Working Parents Can Have It All," now out on paperback with Viva Editions. She leads Enterprise strategy at Magento, the global ecommerce platform of eBay, and was formerly a Managing Director at Goldman Sachs. Find her on Twitter, Facebook, and GettingTo5050.com.

Wikimedia CommonsCiti's latest 48-page "Global Economic Outlook and Strategy" report is out, providing commentary and forecasts on where the bank thinks the world's major economies are headed. Dogged by fiscal "episodic uncertainty," the euro area and the U.S. face "persistent tail risks that could derail the gradually improving economic outlook," writes Citi's chief economist Willem Buiter. "But, the most likely outcome in both the US and euro area is that policymakers will do enough to avert a crisis, even if this involves further 'kicking the can down the road.'" As for China, Citi continues to see "major concerns about the medium-term sustainability" of growth despite the country's Q3 rebound. "More broadly, although delayed Fed tapering may provide supportive near term liquidity conditions, we continue to see downside risks to growth in a wide range of other EM countries, amidst sluggish world trade growth, plus the buildup of EM imbalances (fiscal, current account, private debt)," he wrote. In the report,Â Buiter's team breaks down what's happening in each economy. We pulled out the highlights.

APThe hardest part of investing can be learning when to get out of your own way.  As human beings, we are emotional, impressionable, and often a lot less savvy when it comes to investing than we think.  After the fallout of the Great Recession, the SEC commissioned the Library of Congress to research "Behavioral Patterns and Pitfalls of U.S. Investors," a study that shines a harsh light on the shortcomings of individual investors.  It discovered that one of the "particularly dangerous" mistakes employees often make is blindly buying into their employers' stock. Finance brains call it "familiarity bias," the force that drives people to favor businesses they have some personal connection to when picking stocks. From the study: "Not only does concentration in one asset violate the principle of portfolio diversification, but, if employees devote a large portion of their portfolios to their own company’s shares, they run the risk of compounding their suffering if the company does poorly: first, in loss of compensation and job security, and second, in loss of retirement savings." Need proof? Just ask anyone who used to work at Enron.

Clinton takes home about $200,000 per speech, which apparently is around the going rate for the "formers" of President Obama's cabinet. From NRO: Last Thursday, Clinton spoke for the AIMS Alternative Investment Conference hosted by Goldman Sachs, a closed event exclusively for Goldman clients. AIMS is an annual conference that explores the latest strategies and products available to financial advisers. At the event, Clinton offered what one attendee described to meÂ as â€œprepared remarks followed by questions.â€ On Tuesday, Clinton spoke at theÂ Builders and Innovators Summit, devoted to discussing entrepreneurship and how to help innovators expand and grow their businesses. According toÂ Politico, Clinton conducted a question-and-answer session with Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein. Goldman Sachs declined to comment on the subject of her remarks or why Mrs. Clinton in particular was invited to the events. Well, Goldman can afford it.

Mike Monnelly and David Bonnier — two former analysts at Jim Chanos's Kynikos — have started a new short hedge fund based in London, Bloomberg's Bei Hu reports.  Bonnier joined Kynikos  in 2005. Monnelly joined in 2006. Their new enterprise — The Arhammar Short Alpha Fund — "will invest in 30 to 50 stocks which are expected to underperform the market," according to the report. From Bloomberg:  It will pick stocks to short using bottom-up analysis that focuses on individual companies along four themes at all time: boom-that-goes-bust, consumer fads, aggressive accounting and structurally challenged businesses, Bonnier said. Examples of the boom-that-goes-bust theme include companies related to the subprime crisis of 2008 and the current China construction bubble, said Bonnier. Sounds like the two learned a lot from their former boss Chanos, who has been outspokenly bearish on China for years. Read the full report at Bloomberg »
REUTERS/Alvin BaezAdvertising covers the abandoned structure of an unfinished condominium in the Condado tourist district of San Juan, August 31, 2013.Thanks to its precarious economic situation, Puerto Rico has begun popping up in Q3 earnings reports. On Tuesday, UBS announced it took a $20 million loss related to the island's bonds and an additional $21 million hit on future credit losses related to securities-backed loans. The Wall Street Journal's Corrie Driebusch spotted this detail. “In our view this is a market issue and not a UBS issue,” a UBS spokesman told Investment News. But outside of financial firms, people are actually saying pretty upbeat things about the island. Retail is most bullish. Restaurants opening franchises there include the Cheesecake Factory, Kona Grill, with mall operator Taubman also saying it was expanding it's restaurant component at one of its Puerto Rico holdings.  "[B]ecause the island is so under-retailed and because, culturally, the Puerto Ricans just love to shop, our retailers have done well," said the CEO of real estate company Kimco said in his Q3 call. "Our shopping centers have done well. And the rent growth is real there. And the list of retailers that want to open up in Puerto Rico notwithstanding the economy and the fiscal situation of Puerto Rico ." There's more. Integra Life Sciences says its pharmaceutical plant on the island is doing great.  "We added a third shift and improved our yields to more than double capacity of our collagen products in Puerto Rico and we are now building inventory back to targeted levels," CEO Peter Arduini said.  Acadia Healthcare says it's expanding its hospital there. Schnitzer Steel said 40% of its Q3 capital expenditures went to Canada and Puerto Rico.  The losses on Wall Street linked to the island, however, are real.  Legg Mason's CEO acknowledged the bank has "experienced a redemption rate, that I would say is a bit elevated vis-à-vis the industry," as a result of deteriorating Puerto Rican assets.  Franklin Resources, which runs Franklin Templeton Investments, saw $5.4 billion-worth of outflows from its tax-free bond funds, which Reuters' Tim McLaughlin said were "influenced" by Puerto Rico's credit problems. But Franklin CEO  Greg Johnson blamed "headlines" for the outflows, arguing not much on the ground has changed:   "[W]e view the current selloff as a reflection of weak demands stemming from fears of high interest rates and negative headlines, as opposed to a fundamental change in the underlying credit outlook for the asset class as a whole," said Johnson. Even Puerto Rican financial firms are only experiencing mild pain. Banco Popular said that while it took $6.4 million in losses on Puerto Rican assets, its non-performing loan inflows decreased approximately $800 million or about 83%, "driven by improvements in the Puerto Rico mortgage, Puerto Rico commercial and U.S. commercial portfolios." Puerto Rico-based OFG Bancorp, which says this is all basically old news: " We have been living closely with [these challenges] since at least the mid-2000." 
REUTERS / Jessica RinaldiJeffrey GundlachBond God Jeff Gundlach, the CEO of DoubleLine Capital, and Nobel Prize winning economist Robert Shiller have teamed up for a new equity fund. The pair appeared on CNBC moments ago. The DoubleLine Shiller Enhanced CAPE (DSEEX) fund launches today. It will incorporate fixed income investments by Gundlach's DoubleLine and a stock market strategy using value investing from Shiller.   Gundlach called it "good old fashion blocking and tackling investing." He added that this mutual fund is not going to be investing in these massive momentum trades.  "Part of my DNA is that I'm just not that into massive momentum names," he said.   Gundlach has said recently that he's not into Google or Tesla, which he sees as these massive momentum stocks.    The pair teamed up after Barclays said that they thought there was "great synergy" between their investment philosophies, Gundlach told CNBC. 
JCPenney's desperation to get shoppers in stores could set off a promotional war in retail.  Morgan Stanley analysts say that JCPenney is expected to put merchandise on sale to attract customers, activating a "panic button" within the retail industry.  "We predict JCP will offer extremely deep discounts early in the season...putting pressure on other retailers to do the same," the analysts write in a recent report titled "Expect Coal: We Predict The Weakest Holiday Season Since 2008."  The discounts could end up hurting retailers' profits.  While customers have more money to spend on holiday gifts this year, they are hesitant because of Congressional discord and weaker consumer confidence, according to the report.  JCPenney has been racing to get ahead for the lucrative holiday season.  The company recently hired a new lead marketer who told AdAge that the retailer would have a "robust promotional schedule" this holiday.  JCPenney's share price has tumbled nearly 70% in the past year.  The company fired failed CEO Ron Johnson in April after his strategy to eliminate promotions and fill JCPenney with expensive merchandise alienated customers. 
ISM's October Chicago Purchasing Managers Index was released at 9:45 AM, and the number surged to 65.9 from last month's 55.7 reading. Economists were expecting it to decline slightly to 55.0. The survey results suggest Midwest manufacturing is on fire, and gold and Treasuries are taking a hit on the release as investors price in chances that a tapering of the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing program may be closer as a result. 10-year U.S. Treasury futures went negative after the release, and are now down 0.3%. The yield on the 10-year note is trading at 2.56%, two basis points higher from yesterday's close. Gold is trading at $1323 an ounce, down 1.9%. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 is trading at 1763, unchanged from yesterday's close. The index fell as low as 1755 following the release of the Chicago PMI report. "In its narrative the organization says that businesses were 'seemingly unaffected by the [government] shutdown'," says Andrew Wilkinson, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak. "In light of the Fedâ€™s failure to draw additional attention to the impact of the fiscal showdown inÂ Washington, that message is likely to resonate with investors." The chart below shows the drop in Treasury futures this morning on the right. The big decline on the left is the reaction to yesterday's release of the October FOMC statement. Yesterday, the FOMC statement failed to acknowledge the effects of the fiscal battles in Washington, D.C. on the American economy, something investors were hoping for to confirm the consensus view that the Fed would likely refrain from tapering down its quantitative easing program until March. Now, the tapering timeline appears to be getting closer. "The biggest concentration of probability now is that tapering begins in the January-March period versus March and beyond two days ago," says Steven Englander. "So a good data point or two and there is plenty of room for asset markets to back up." Thinkorswim

Whiskey is the one spirit with a modest correlation between price and quality. In other words, it really does pay to spend a bit more on an Irish, Scotch, or America bourbon. Here's the graph, with the blue line indicating the correlation.  So next time you're at your local liquor store, cut back your budget and look for something cheap. Unless, of course, you're buying whiskey.
foursquare Kino W.It's Halloween, so a number of you, both Wall Streeters and civilians, will want to go out and have a good time tonight. So consider this a public service announcement. New York is a big, bad city with tons of options for entertainment. And when there's plenty of choice, that means many of those choices can be... obnoxious. Click here to see the bars&gt; Wall Street bars are no exception to this rule, in fact, these bars have their own way of being annoying, off-putting, and sometimes gross. The danger is that 'Wall Street' is not a geographical boundary here, these are simply bars that attract Wall Streeters (though they're generally in Midtown and the Financial District). So anyone could easily stumble into one completely unawares. To mitigate our own risk, some time ago we surveyed our readers about where Wall Street goes to be their worst selves. Then we did some investigating ourselves. What did we find? Think: Uber preps, frat-tastic kids just out of college, girls who can't stop screaming (woooooo!), and music that is banned in most tasteful establishments (Shania Twain anyone?). Enter these bars at your own peril.
Morgan Stanley makes a troubling prediction: the upcoming holiday shopping season will be the worst since 2008. In a new report â€” titled "Expect Coal: We Predict the Weakest Holiday Since 2008" â€” Morgan Stanley analysts Kimberly Greenberger, Scott Devitt, Ellen Zentner, and Jay Sole explain their forecast for a meager 1.6% increase in same-store sales at softline retailers in the fourth quarter. "We believe an uncertain U.S. macroeconomic backdrop, unfavorable calendar shifts, continued big ticket item strength (autos, appliances, home improvement) and increased promotional activity likely inhibits 2013 Holiday sales as well as overall near-term retail sales growth," writes the Morgan Stanley team. "Our bottom-up analysis (the sales weighted average of our individual company estimates) implies a +1.6% increase in Holiday comp store sales, [1.9 percentage points] below last yearâ€™s +3.5% gain, both excluding [J.C. Penney]." National Retail Federation, Morgan Stanley ResearchIn the report, the analysts paint a grim picture of the American consumer: We have a cautious outlook on the 2013 Holiday season for three reasons: 1) We continue to believe consumer confidence is unlikely to rebound anytime soon, 2) We expect weak mall traffic likely continues through November/December, and 3) We predict the most intense promotional Holiday environment since 2008. We look to selectively buy our favorite retail stocks and prefer those companies with revenue upside or potential for positive margin surprise (KORS, LTD &amp; ROST).  Four negative data points imply unfavorable consumer spending inclinations: 1) The National Retail Federation (NRF) forecasts the average Holiday shopper will spend $737.95 on gifts, deÌcor, and greeting cards this year, 2% less than last year; 2) 51% of those people polled said economic concerns would affect their holiday spending plans and 79.5% said they plan to spend less overall during the Holiday; 3) On October 17th, Bloombergâ€™s monthly consumer expectations gauge indicated the percent of respondents saying the economy is going to get worse showed the biggest surge since October 2008; and 4) The NRF forecasts Halloween spending per person dropped 6% this year. The only other time the NRF forecasted a Halloween spending decline was 2009.  Although the NRF projects +3.9% total Holiday sales growth, the increase is a result of more shoppers participating in Holiday shopping this year vs. LY. On a per person basis, total gift spending (ex. greeting cards, decorations) is expected to decrease -2.5% to $536.85, the first forecasted decline since 2008/2009 (Exhibit 2). The report also points to a shift in spending toward "big-ticket items" like cars, home improvements, and appliances. Company Data, Morgan Stanley Research"Big ticket leading indicators such as the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers 'AHAM 6' which measures domestic shipments of six major big-ticket appliances (washers &amp; dryers, dishwashers, refrigerators, freezers, ovens, and ranges),Â continues to show staggering trends (Exhibit 7)," write the Morgan Stanley analysts. "Although big-ticket items are likely less of a headwind in 2014, we expect a shift in discretionary spending towards durables to continue to squeeze apparel sales in FY14."
Â "If you spend more thanÂ 13 minutesÂ analyzing economic and market forecasts, you've wasted 10 minutes."- Peter Lynch, greatest stock market investor or all time Up until 2008, it was a given that economists had no business anywhere near the trading desk. Their work was important as a framework toward understanding the interplay between the markets and the real world - but that was about the extent of it. Then post-crisis, some of these guys became "rock stars". Which is fine up to a point. All of us market participants and investors can learn a lot from their research. But when they started putting out newsletters and alerts and "monitors" to traders and fund managers - as though there was some sort of actionable message embedded in their reports - things got strange. All of a sudden there were economists making equity market buy and sell calls in the media and there were even economics reporters "grading the trade" on TV. Economics is extremely important to understanding the world in which we live, but the linear application of it can be deadly with actual money on the line. Thinking that low GDP growth would mean low stock returns would have sat you out of one of the best bull markets in history these past few years. It also would have made you miss the bottom of the European stock market and led you to have guessed that China, with its world-beating growth numbers, would outperform (it's actually had the fastest economic growth and the poorest stock market returns).Â  The reality is that there is no such positive correlation over various periods of time between economic data and stocks in any given country. And economic data in the short-term is every bit as unpredictable as stock market behavior, so basing a forecast for one on what you predict for the other is like picking out a sports jacket and slacks in the dark and hoping one is not navy while the other is black. A study from the London School of Economics concluded that choosing where to invest based on favorable economic factors is actually a recipe for underperformance. Researchers Dimson, Marsh and Staunton said "take the records of 83 countries from 1972 to 2009 (the most comprehensive set available) and rank them by GDP growth over the previous five years. Investing each year in the countries with the highest economic growth over the preceding five years earned an annual return of 18.4%, but investing in the lowest-growth countries returned 25.1%." Another study by BNY Mellon looked at the S&amp;P 500 versus US economic growth from 1970-2012 and concluded that there is no link whatsoever between the two. PIMCO provides us with a perfect example of this mismatch and the damage it can do - each year it hosts a conclave of a few hundred of the smartest people in the world, they call it the Secular Forum. At the conclusion of this multi-day event, PIMCO issues a proclamation containing the conclusions they've drawn and the forecasts they're making as a result. The good news is that the firm has been exactly right about, well, everything since the start of the post-crash period. They actually invented the New Normal concept of persistently low economic growth, high unemployment and increasing social inequality back in 2009 - Bullseye! The problem is, as Mohamed El-Erian was forced to admit at conference this spring, that they nailed the economy and yet they got the markets completely wrong. If you had listened to PIMCO's economic forecasts and then done the opposite of what they did with your portfolio, you'd have done spectacularly well. My friend Eddy Elfenbein, a bottoms-up value stock picker who's been blogging at Crossing Wall Street since 1964, has made this point before. In a post this fall, Eddy showed a scatterplot chart of the annual change in price for the S&amp;P 500 versus annual nominal gross domestic product. Not only does there appear to be no correlation whatsoever, you could squint and almost perceive a slightly negative correlation! Bloomberg News reminds us of just how disconnected economics and stocks can be sometimes with an article about the top-performing market in the world, which just happens to exist amidst the world's worst economic story of the decade: Greek stocks, once shunned by investors concerned that a default would force the nation out of the euro, are beating almost every market in the world as a six-year recession eases and new investors consider purchases. Since June 5, 2012, two weeks before MSCI Inc. gave notice it may reclassify Greece as an emerging market, the countryâ€™sÂ ASE IndexÂ has surged 146 percent, trimming the decline from its 2007 peak to 79 percent. The gains topped all 94 national benchmarks globally in the period, except Venezuela, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Yields on Greeceâ€™s 10-year government bonds have dropped to 8.31 percent from a peak of 33.7 percent in March 2012. Josh here - let's talk about the state of the Greek economy. The country is unable to borrow without the assistance of its Northern European benefactors backstopping and haircutting and bailing-out and inspecting. Debt-to-GDP will peak out in the next year at some 176% - a disastrous number for any country, especially for a country that does not have the ability to use currency deflation to make it more manageable. In the meantime, over the last five years, Greece has seen a full 25% of its economic output literally disappear - vaporized. This while unemployment has shown almost no sign of abating, the current rate of joblessness today stands at an unfathomable 27%. But the stock market is not the economy. We explained this to clients with our European overweights this past spring (You're overweighting Europe?!?!?) and are currently doing the same with our investments into the much-hated materials sector.Â  Stocks trade based on three things: sentiment, valuation and trend. Yes, economic data feeds into these things, but it is up to the trader or investor to determine their combined favorability, an economist does not do that sort of work. The Greek stock market was the most hated in the world (sentiment), one of the very cheapest on valuation (four times earnings at the bottom!) and the trend had only one direction to go (the Greek stock market, called the ASE, had hit a 22-year low in June of 2012 and was down 90% from the 2007 high).Â  Investors should read voraciously about the economy and be up to speed on the data and prevailing opinions at all times. But the acquisition of this knowledge should be in service of a greater contextual understanding of the world around us - and not as a trigger to do something in our portfolios.

George Bell grew up in a Wall Street family, made adventure documentaries after school, and then went on to become an entrepreneur. He was CEO of Excite when it went public and recently sold Jumptap to Millennial Media. In the video below, he explains four basic (but difficult) truths he learned through the experience to finance career site, OneWire. Here's the breakdown: 1. It canâ€™t all be about moneyâ€”entrepreneurs have a real passion for what theyâ€™re doing. He explains, â€œGenuineness in an enterprise comes from a passion for a product, a breakthrough, or a disruption of some kindâ€¦and if you donâ€™t have courage and passion to do itâ€”because God knows the odds are against youâ€”I can promise you no amount of money will ultimately give you that.â€ 2. Entrepreneurs have to be both realistic and totally unrealistic at the same time. â€œItâ€™s odd,â€ he says, â€œbecause Iâ€™ve seen the best of these entrepreneurs be quite out of touch in the sense that their mission will conquer everything in the face of odds, while also being hyper in touch about the realistic issues around cash and P&amp;L. Itâ€™s an odd combination and not everybodyâ€™s DNA is made that way, but I think the best of the people Iâ€™ve seen run these companies can do that.â€ 3. You need to pretend to be the status quo, while secretly working against it. â€œPeople often underestimate the entrenched cultures that work against youâ€¦You find that when you want to disrupt you have to both cajole and do things that coerce the customer base into believing not that much is changing, while you have to believe actually that quite a lot is changing.â€ 4. Great entrepreneurs are obsessive about cash. Bell insists, â€œThe worst mistakes Iâ€™ve seen consistently in early stage entrepreneurship is not managing the limited amount of cash against the opportunityâ€¦the dance stops when you run out of cash. I donâ€™t care how good the idea is. When youâ€™re out, the musicâ€™s over.â€ Watch the full interview below, or start with Part I here.

This morning, new economic data revealed that core consumer price inflation unexpectedly fell to 0.8% year over year in October from 1.0% the month before, while eurozone unemployment unexpectedly rose to 12.2% in August and September. The data are causing a bit of chatter about the risk of European Japanification this morning. "The risks of the eurozone suffering a Japanese-style 'lost decade' of stagnant economic growth are, if anything, increasing," says Nicholas Spiro, managing director of Spiro Sovereign Strategy. "Europe's single currency area, with its anaemic (and in some cases non-existent) growth, surge in public indebtedness and low bond yields, is looking more Japanese with each passing day." SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale strategist Kit Juckes agrees. "For the ECB, falling inflation is a warning about theÂ JapanificationÂ of the euro area economy that I hope they won't ignore," he writes in a note. Juckes says the following charts illustrating this dynamic are the most important charts in the world. SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale/Kit Juckes SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale/Kit Juckes SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale/Kit Juckes "It does seem to me that a world where nominal gdp growth is too low relative to interest payments tends to allow debt/GDP to snowball; that provides the natural bias for fiscal austerity," says Juckes. "Given that and given a starting point where inflation seems to be heading towards zero as wages remain under pressure in much of Europe, I canâ€™t see how you get growth without a more aggressively accommodative central bank. ItÂ  looks like a slow-motion train wreck that can only be avoided by much more imaginative policies."
PIMCO / YouTubeBill Gross, PIMCOBill Gross' latest monthly PIMCO Investment Outlook is out, and it spends some time discussing the massive wealth disparity in America. "Having gotten rich at the expense of labor, the guilt sets in and I begin to feel sorry for the less well-off," he writes. Gross calls for the wealthiest Americans to support higher taxes rather than be "Scrooge McDucks." From his note: Having benefited enormously via the leveraging of capital since the beginning of my career and having shared a decreasing percentage of my income thanks to Presidents Reagan and Bush 43 via lower government taxes, I now find my intellectual leanings shifting to the plight of labor. I often tell my wife Sue itâ€™s probably a Kennedy-esque type of phenomenon. Having gotten rich at the expense of labor, the guilt sets in and I begin to feel sorry for the less well-off, writing very public Investment Outlooks that â€œdisâ€ the success that provided me the soapbox in the first place. If your immediate reaction is to nod up and down, then give yourself some points in this intellectual tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte. Still, I would ask the Scrooge McDucks of the world who so vehemently criticize what they consider to be counterproductive, even crippling taxation of the wealthy in the midst of historically high corporate profits and personal income, to consider this: Instead of approaching the tax reform argument from the standpoint of what an enormous percentage of the overall income taxes the top 1% pay, consider how much of the national income youâ€™ve been privileged to make. In the United States, the share of total pre-tax income accruing to the top 1% has more than doubled from 10% in the 1970s to 20% today. Admit that you, and I and others in the magnificent â€œ1%â€ grew up in a gilded age of credit, where those who borrowed money or charged fees on expanding financial assets had a much better chance of making it to the big tent than those who used their hands for a living. Yes I know many of you money people worked hard as did I, and you survived and prospered where others did not. A fair economic system should always allow for an opportunity to succeed. Congratulations. Smoke that cigar, enjoy that Chateau Lafite 1989. But (mostly you guys) acknowledge your good fortune at having been born in the â€˜40s, â€˜50s or â€˜60s, entering the male-dominated workforce 25 years later, and having had the privilege of riding a credit wave and a credit boom for the past three decades. You did not, as President Obama averred, â€œbuild that,â€ you did not create that wave. You rode it. And now itâ€™s time to kick out and share some of your good fortune by paying higher taxes or reforming them to favor economic growth and labor, as opposed to corporate profits and individual gazillions. Youâ€™ll still be able to attend those charity galas and demonstrate your benevolence and philanthropic character to your admiring public. Youâ€™ll just have to write a little bit smaller check. Scrooge McDuck would complain but then heâ€™s swimming in it, and can afford to duck paddle to a shallower end for a while. If youâ€™re in the privileged 1%, you should be paddling right alongside and willing to support higher taxes on carried interest, and certainly capital gains readjusted to existing marginal income tax rates. Stanley Druckenmiller and Warren Buffett have recently advocated similar proposals ...  "The era of taxing 'capital' at lower rates than 'labor' should end," he said. Last week, Gross made headlines for calling out corporate raider Carl Icahn on a similar matter. Icahn has called for Apple to initiate a massive share repurchase plane. "Icahn should leave Apple alone &amp; spend more time like Bill Gates," tweeted Gross. "If Icahnâ€™s so smart, use it to help people not yourself." Interestingly, Gross attacks the wealth creation that has come from share repurchases of late. And he believes there are lessons to be learned by both corporate America and America as a whole. PIMCO"Profits ... increased because the company cut expenses along the way," wrote Gross. "Earnings per share (EPS) did even better, because X used some of its cash flow to buy back stock instead of reinvesting much of it in new plant and equipment. "The simple answer is that long-term growth for each company, and for all countries, depends not on balance sheet alchemy and financial wizardry, but investment and the ultimate demand for a company or a countryâ€™s 'products,'" he said.

REUTERS/John Gress Chicago PMI, a gauge of manufacturing in the Midwest, surged to 65.9 in October, from 55.7. This is the highest level since March 2011, and the biggest monthly increase in over 30 years. This crushed expectations for 55. The report pointed out that the government shutdown didn't really impact businesses. â€œThe government might have shut down but Chicago area companies powered ahead in October as orders and production surged," said Philip Uglow, Chief Economist at MNI Indicators. This along with the Fed's failure to ackowledge the troubles in Washington suggests the Fed could be closer to tapering its $85 billion monthly asset purchase program. A reading below 50 indicates contraction. Here's the entire release: "The October Chicago Business Barometer rose to 65.9 in October from 55.7 in September, led by double digit gains in New Orders, Production and Order Backlogs. Octoberâ€™s gain placed the Barometer at the highest level since March 2011 with companies seemingly unaffected by the government shutdown. Octoberâ€™s advance in the Barometer was its biggest monthly increase in over 30 years and only the third time in the past decade the Barometer has risen for four consecutive months. Chicago area business expanded at a surprisingly steep pace with some panelists reporting brisk activity linked to inventory replenishment, increased customer demand, success with new product lines and new distribution channels. New Orders soared to their highest level in nine years, adding to two prior months of gains while Production expanded to its highest level since February 2011. Order Backlogs leapt out of a contractionary phase to the highest since March 2011. In line with expansion in New Orders and Production, Employment rose to its highest since June 2013, but remained well below the level of New Orders and Production. Inventories continued to contract, though at a slower pace, while Prices Paid and Supplier Delivery times declined marginally. Commenting on the MNI Chicago Report, Philip Uglow, Chief Economist at MNI Indicators said, â€œThe government might have shut down but Chicago area companies powered ahead in October as orders and production surged.â€ â€œWhile it is a little surprising to see such a large rise in activity, the consistent increase in the Barometer over the past four months suggests the recovery is gaining traction.â€
YouTube/LionsgateVODAnd they said times were good. Bloomberg has a story this morning sure to bug bankers and traders (and probably inspire eye-rolls from every other profession) about this upcoming bonus season. It may not be that great. Bloomberg's Michael J. Moore and Zeke Faux report: Rising revenue at many banks is stoking employeesâ€™ hopes for larger bonuses, after year-end payouts were cut in the wake of the financial crisis and packed with restricted stock, which vests over time. Firms instead are preparing to shrink compensation for individuals amid investor pressure to improve return on equity. The measure of profitability stands at 10 percent or lower at each of the five biggest Wall Street banks - - less than half the levels that preceded the credit crisis. For example, "Goldman Sachs, along with the investment-banking divisions of six of its biggest U.S. and European rivals, allocated a collective 39 percent of revenue for compensation in the first nine months, down from 42 percent a year earlier and the 50 percent some firms earmarked before the financial crisis," according to the report. "Goldman Sachsâ€™s 41 percent ratio so far this year is its lowest nine-month figure as a public company." But Goldman's Gary Cohn told Bloomberg's Stephanie Ruhle that bonuses will probably depend on fourth quarter revenue, a period of time he's "cautiously optimistic" about. â€œAt Goldman Sachs, if we donâ€™t have a good fourth quarter, bonuses will be down, because the one thing we have done and have committed to our shareholders is that our bonus payments will be directly correlated to our revenue," he said.

Traditionally, Warren Buffett likes to have $20 billion on hand to invest for "hunting elephants" at Berkshire Hathaway, but large acquisitions have been so few and far between in the last year that Berkshire has $40 billion on hand right now, says Bloomberg. It's hard not to feel for the firm. And according to Barclays, this problem isn't going away. The bank estimates that Berkshire will post a profit of $4.3 billion when it announces its Q3 earnings tomorrow. At the end of March, Berkshire had $49.1 billion cash on hand — that's even after spending $12.3 billion to buy Heinz. Barclays estimates that Berkshire had $34.7 billion at the end of June, and this month Mars Inc. paid off a $4.4 billion loan Berkshire made to it in 2008. So that's where it all comes from. It's also interesting to note (as Bloomberg does) that the $20 billion Berkshire has on hand for safe keeping/rainy days/that oh-hell-lets-just-buy-a-Fortune 500-company kind of shopping is all in Treasuries. As interests rates are low, it hasn't really been going to work for them. But, that's not the point. It's there to help Buffett sleep at night.
Yesterday's October FOMC statement is causing economists and market participants to adjust their views on when the Fed is most likely to begin tapering down its quantitative easing program. After the government shutdown and debt ceiling fight happened — and then was merely postponed to the first quarter of 2014 instead of resolved — a new Wall Street consensus formed around the notion that the Fed probably wouldn't begin tapering until March. However, the lack of any reference to the fiscal battles in the October FOMC statement spurred a small sell-off in stock and bond markets, and Wall Street economists began to reconsider when tapering would happen in their reactions to the release. In a note, Citi's Steven Englander presents a chart to illustrate these changing views. "A good data point or two and there is plenty of room for asset markets to back up," he writes. "Figure 1 shows our view of the markets expectations of tapering just prior to the September FOMC, just prior to yesterday’s FOMC and today. The path is indicative, not a hard measure of investor expectations, but we would stress how modest the pullback in dovish expectations has been." Right now, the Fed buys $85 billion of Treasuries and mortgage bonds each month. The chart below illustrates different forecasts for the path of how monthly purchases will eventually be wound down to zero. CitiFX
TBIThe Labor Department just published its latest weekly tally of initial unemployment claims. Claims fell to 340,000 from 350,000 a week ago. However this was a hair higher than theÂ  338,000 expected by economists. The 4-week moving average climbed by 8,000 to 356,250. "Following swings caused by a change in computer systems in California, claims are settling into a higher range, indicating the 16-day partial federal shutdown this month prompted some employers to dismiss staff," reported Bloomberg's Lorraine Woellert. "The coming several weeks should point to a more conclusive direction in the claims data, and we suspect that further improvement is likely as claims averaged roughly 330K before data collection issues began impacting the figures," said TD Securities' Gennadiy Goldberg. "This should continue to suggest that the underlying tone on the firing side of the labor market equation remains better, even as companies may be delaying new hires amid the ongoing uncertainty over the federal budget."
REUTERS/ Tim ChongYesterday, the FOMC made no mention of the effects of the fiscal battles in Washington, D.C. in its October statement, something many on Wall Street were expecting. Before the release, the prevailing consensus was that the Federal Reserve's monetary policymaking body would refrain from tapering until its March meeting, given the potential negative impact of the government shutdown â€” and a potential repeat in January â€” on the economy. Market participants were therefore looking for a nod to fiscal brinksmanship in the statement as a signal to confirm this thesis. When it wasn't confirmed, stock and bond markets sold off as investors re-calibrated positions to reflect a different set of probabilities related to the Fed's tapering timeline. Steven Englander, global head of G-10 FX strategy at Citi, warns there may be further to go, saying the "market still has a lot of dovishness to unwind." In a note, he writes: We enter a 1-month period of data fog. It will be very difficult to compare October to September (and November to October next month) but November to September willÂ  be reasonably meaningful. What will matter in coming days is how upcoming Fed speakers spin their decision. Asset markets will come under pressure if they keep repeating that tapering isn't tightening because they have a powerful forward guidance weapon at their disposal. Investors do not believe it. If they stress that the weak data will not make them comfortable with tapering for a good while, risk gets bought again.Â Today claims will be the focus -- a number under 330k and we are off to the races in advancing the tapering schedule In terms of the actual tapering path that the market believes, we are far from the early September path. The biggest concentration of probability now is that tapering begins in the January-March period versus March and beyond two days ago. The end point may have pulledÂ  back a month but it does not look like investors yet believe September 2014 for the end of QE, let alone June. So a good data point or two and there is plenty of room for asset markets to back up. "We would stress how modest the pullback in dovish expectations has been," says Englander. Fed speakers begin to hit the tape Friday with speeches from St. Louis Fed president James Bullard, Minneapolis Fed president Naranya Kocherlakota, and Richmond Fed president Jeffrey Lacker.
The chart below was just tweeted by Horace Dediu of Asymco, one of the top Apple analysts. The chart shows global foot traffic to Apple stores worldwide each quarter. As you can see, the number of visitors to Apple stores is still growing, but at a flattening rate. Horace Dediu, Asymco The key questions that flow from this are whether traffic growth is slowing because Apple is opening fewer stores as a percentage of its store base or whether the growth in excitement about Apple products is beginning to wane (or both). If it's the former â€” Apple opening fewer stores â€” the question is whether Apple has picked all the low-hanging fruit in terms of location and therefore just can't find that many great places to put new stores, or... whether Apple's year without a head of global retail has disrupted the expansion of the retail business. Dediu shared some thoughts on these questions on Twitter this morning, as well as an additional chart: First, Dediu shows that traffic to each Apple store is declining modestly. So that's part of the answer. @hblodget @tillman_john What you need to measure is per store not total. Per store visitors steady since mid 2010. pic.twitter.com/KsZEEUEl4k So at first glance it seems like most of the answer is a slowdown in the growth of Apple's stores, as measured by square footage as opposed to number of stores. And the key question that stems from that is whether the market opportunity for new Apple stores is becoming saturated or whether Apple just isn't opening them fast enough. Dediu is writing an article on the topic, so we'll get some additional answers soon.Â Check Asymco's site for the latest.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese regulators have expanded a pilot plan allowing banks to package loans into tradable securities to include foreign banks, sources said. Chinese policymakers see securitization as a tool to shift risk away from the banking system to reduce the chances of a financial crisis as economic growth slows and bad loans rise. Securitization would also help satisfy voracious investor demand for alternatives to the chronically weak stock market and frothy property sector. Chinese PremierÂ Li KeqiangÂ told a cabinet meeting in late August thatÂ ChinaÂ would aggressively expand the securitization of credit assets. The central bank launched a pilot program in 2005 to allow banks to package loans into bond-like securities known as collateralized loan obligations (CLO), but growth has been slow. The expansion will be limited to small-scale deals, two sources with direct knowledge of the plan said. Recent deals by domestic banks have ranged from 1-to-10 billion yuan ($164 million to $1.64 billion). The expanded program is open to all of the 42 foreign banks with locally incorporated branches inÂ China, a grouping that includesÂ HSBC Holdings PLCÂ &lt;HSBA.L&gt; &lt;0005.HK&gt;,Â Standard CharteredÂ PLC &lt;STAN.L&gt; and Citibank &lt;C.N&gt;. "Our company is preparing a plan for (securitizing) financial leasing (assets)," an executive at a foreign bank said. The sources declined to be identified because the expansion of the pilot program has not been officially announced. Securitization is unlikely to significantly boost foreign bank profits in the near term, but their participation could heldÂ China's broader securitization drive. "IfÂ Standard CharteredÂ or HSBC issued a CLO product, its underlying credit assets would probably come mainly from foreign firms, so the asset pool would be more transparent," said a foreign bank executive who previously participated in early CLO deals at a Chinese bank. Such products would likely be attractive to investors and would therefore serve as a model for domestic lenders to follow, the executive said. However, foreign banks controlled 1.9 percent of total Chinese banking assets at the end of 2011, according to accounting firm PwC, indicating they have only a limited pool of loans available to create CLOs. Market participants have previously said lack of transparency of underlying assets is a key barrier to faster growth of securitization inÂ China. Investors are wary of buying assets if they lack the information necessary to assess risks. That is critical given concerns that the banking system is struggling with an overhang of bad debt from the state-backed lending binge unleashed to helpÂ ChinaÂ weather the global financial crisis. Market participants widely suspect the true scale of the bad debt problem is far larger than the official, system-wide non-performing loan ratio of under 1 percent. About 90 billion yuan ($14.8 billion) of CLO products have been issued inÂ China's interbank market since 2005, according to Reuters calculations based on central bank statements. That is a tiny fraction of the 70 trillion yuan in local currency loans outstanding at the end of September. Securitization deals were halted during the financial crisis. The pilot resumed in 2011. Under the expansion, regulators have asked foreign banks to submit preliminary plans for securitization, the sources said. Once they have received feedback on the preliminary plans, the banks can formally apply for permission to execute the deals. Banks will be able to choose whether to issue the securitized assets intoÂ China's interbank market, where more than 95 percent of all domestic bonds trade, or on the stock exchange, where a small minority of bonds also trade. Securitization inÂ ChinaÂ has also been hindered by the existence of three separate pilot programs, each controlled by different regulators. In addition to the CLO program, theÂ ChinaÂ Banking Regulatory CommissionÂ overseas an asset management pilot, while theÂ National Association of Financial Market Institutional Investors, overseen by the central bank, is in charge of a program for asset-backed notes.

APSony's Kaz Hirai (center) bows with two other executivesTOKYOÂ (Reuters) - Sony Corp cut its full-year profit targets after slipping to a quarterly net loss as its recovering TV operation relapsed into the red. The Japanese electronics maker's worse-than-expected performance, a setback after years of striving to return to its former glories, also featured weak sales of video cameras and a steep slump in personal computers in the July-September quarter. With a quarterly net loss of 19.3 billion yen ($197 million), Sony's bad-news Thursday came in stark contrast to an upbeat showing by Japanese peerÂ Panasonic Corp.Â It also stirred doubts about how the best-known Japanese technology company can anchor a turnaround as rivals like Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co have gained dominance through heavy investment in newÂ mobile devices. "I still cannot see any fundamental and believable strategy for the rebirth of Sony's electronics business," said Makoto Kikuchi, CEO ofÂ Myojo Asset ManagementÂ based inÂ Tokyo. "On the other hand Panasonic, which is shifting its business away from consumer electronics, is reporting better-than-expected results. The contrast is like night and day." The TV operation flipped from a 5.2 billion yen operating profit in April-June - its first quarterly profit in three years - to a 9.3 billion yen operating loss. Japan's consumer electronics makers have long been hobbled by losses from their TV operations, hit by stiff competition from Asian rivals. Many, like Panasonic, have been shifting their focus to industrial businesses such as infrastructure or supplying the auto sector, but Sony has stuck with its focus on the consumer business. Overall, Sony cut its operating profit forecast for the year through next March to 170 billion yen from previous guidance of 230 billion yen, which would have been flat on the year. The 170 billion yen forecast is below the average of 221 billion yen expected by 22 analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Since Chief Executive Kazuo Hirai took the helm last year, Sony has promised a rebound in hardware with a three-pronged strategy focused onÂ mobile devices, imaging technology and gaming. But only a few of its consumer product divisions, includingÂ smartphones, showed signs of holding up in the latest quarter. Sony said it still expects to sell 42 millionÂ smartphonesÂ this fiscal year, unchanged from previous guidance. There have also been signs of a strong debut next month in the U.S. and other key markets for Sony's newÂ PlayStation 4 game console, based on preorders. As with previous consoles, development and rollout costs have been steep, although Sony has pledged to turn a profit much faster than the four years it took for the previous iteration of the console to make money. Sony, under pressure from major shareholder and hedge fund managerÂ Daniel LoebÂ to generate more value from its entertainment division, also posted a 17.8 billion yen second-quarter operating loss in its pictures division. Of eight divisions, only music and financial services units managed to boost profit from a year ago. "I think we're at a stage where they really should be reconsidering their (three-pronged) strategy but the company is not going there yet," said Myojo Asset's Kikuchi.

Flickr / Federal ReserveThe Marriner S. Eccles Building, completed in 1937 and dedicated to former Chairman Eccles in 1982.TOKYO (Reuters) - Six major central banks said on Thursday they would make their web of currency swap arrangements permanent as a "prudent liquidity backstop" in case of future global financial strains. The Bank of Japan, U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the Bank of England and the central banks of Canada and Switzerland will convert their "temporary bilateral liquidity swap arrangements" into standing arrangements that "will remain in place until further notice". "The existing temporary swap arrangements have helped to ease strains in financial markets and mitigate their effects on economic conditions," a coordinated statement from the central banks said. "The standing arrangements will continue to serve as a prudent liquidity backstop." Currency swap lines were first introduced nearly six years ago in response to a global credit crunch that starved banks of liquidity and threatened to gum up the entire financial system. They were an important part of the policy response to the 2007-2009 financial crisis, keeping a lid on funding costs which had spiraled due to fear over counter-party risk. The arrangements were next due for review in February. Speaking after the BOJ kept its massive stimulus program in place, GovernorÂ Haruhiko Kuroda said the structure had helped bring stability to financial markets and the move to make it permanent did not denote any new alarm about liquidity. "We decided to make them permanent to avoid uncertainty as they were due to expire next February," Kuroda told a news conference. "We have no plan to extend the swap arrangements beyond the six central banks." (Writing by Mike Peacock; Editing by John Stonestreet)
REUTERS/Edgar Su A visitor looks at portraits of Facebook's founder Mark Zuckerberg at solo exhibition "The Face of Facebook" by Chinese artist Zhu Jia at a gallery in Singapore October 30, 2013.SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook Inc posted strong growth in its mobile advertising business on Wednesday but rattled investors after saying that it did not plan to boost the frequency of ads shown to users. Shares of the world's No. 1 online social network soared as much as 15 percent in extended trading before suddenly falling to $47.40, down 3 percent from its $49.10 close. The stock settled at $49.16. In July, Facebook said it was showing one ad per 20 stories in the newsfeed, but Chief Financial Officer David Ebersman told analysts Wednesday that the current ratio, although slightly higher than 5 percent, would not increase much more going forward. Ebersman's comments, combined with remarks suggesting that young teenage users in the U.S. were beginning to use Facebook less frequently, soured the mood abruptly on an afternoon when the company topped Wall Street's targets with a whopping 60 percent increase in revenue, driven by its accelerating mobile business. "There seems to be concern about the ad load not going up," said BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield. But Greenfield said he believed investors were over-reacting, noting that increasing advertising prices, rather than the volume of ads, is more important for growth in Facebook's topline. Facebook's newsfeed ads, which inject paid marketing messages straight into a user's stream of news and content, have boosted Facebook's revenue and its stock price in recent months. The ads are ideally suited for the smaller-sized screens of smartphones and other mobile devices, from which nearly half of Facebook's monthly users now access the service. But the company has had to balance showing more ads inside its users' newsfeed with the fear that too many of them would irritate fickle users and drive them elsewhere. That's a reality that some investors may have overlooked, after Facebook reported strong third-quarter financial results on Thursday, with advertising revenue up 66 percent. "There's some degree to which you can expand, but there's an optimal level after which you risk losing your audience," said Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser, referring to the portion of ads that Facebook shows on its service. Still, he said the stock's "reaction and counter-reaction was probably a little extreme. This was under any estimation a good quarter." Revenue from mobile ads, which appear on smartphones, represented 49 percent of Facebook's total advertising revenue in the third quarter, or roughly $880 million. Mobile ads generated roughly $150 million in the year-ago period, when Facebook was just beginning to develop its mobile ad business. And Facebook said that its ads were getting noticed: The average daily user of Facebook is "engaging" with more than one ad per week, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said during the conference call. "It looks like they're firing on all cylinders," said JMP Securities analyst Ronald Josey. He said that Facebook's strong mobile advertising revenue in particular has put to rest the worries that many investors had at the time of the company's 2012 IPO. "They clearly have the product, they have the traffic and now they have the advertising solution," said Josey. Facebook shares have doubled in the past three months, as Wall Street has warmed to the Internet company's ability to thrive as consumers increasingly access the Web on smartphones and other mobile devices. Facebook said the number of its monthly active users increased to 1.19 billion as of the end of September, up from 1.15 billion at the end of June. Facebook said it counts roughly 507 million daily active mobile users. Facebook said it earned net income of $425 million, or 17 cents a share, in the three months ended September 30, compared with a net loss of $59 million, or 2 cents a share in the year-ago period.

Facebook's total revenue in the third quarter was $2.016 billion, ahead of the average analyst expectation of $1.911 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Private sector houses were fairly quiet rising just 1.5% with units through the roof, up 31.8% month-on-month. Some might downgrade this data as so much of it is on the unit category, and the fact that with demand for credit only rising 0.4% in the month, it is hard to square the two data points up. But in an increasingly tight housing market the bottom rung on the ladder is no longer the quarter acre block 50 kilometres from the central business district but rather something closer and in a unit complex. Itâ€™s all about affordability and lifestyle. The really good news is the 2.5% increase in the trend for building approvals. And while we know majors such as ANZ are on-the-record saying this is going to be a muted construction cycle, the RBA will be happy that it looks like some construction is actually kicking in â€“ monetary policy still works. The RBA will however be less happy with the rally in the Aussie Dollar which is now back at 95 cents, on the back of this strong data.

REUTERS/Yuya ShinoPeople look at the prices of tickets outside a ticket shop at the Ginza shopping district in Tokyo, October 31, 2013.TOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan stopped short of officially forecasting it could raise inflation to 2 percent in two years after a review on Thursday, but said it was on track to reach its target and would maintain its massive stimulus as long as needed. The central bank did revise up its economic growth forecast for the 2014 fiscal year beginning next April to 1.5 percent, judging the world's third-largest economy could keep growing above its potential despite a sales tax increase next year. As widely expected, the BOJ had earlier kept intact its intense monetary stimulus launched in April, under which it aims to double base money via asset purchases to meet its target of lifting inflation to 2 percent in roughly two years. It decision came after the U.S. Federal Reserve maintained its own massive bond-buying program. In its semi-annual outlook report, the BOJ kept its forecasts for core consumer inflation in fiscal 2014 and 2015 at 1.3 percent and 1.9 percent respectively, excluding the increase in the sales tax, a sign it is on track to meet its goal. Even though it did not formally forecast inflation reaching 2 percent, economists worry the BOJ is expecting too much from government stimulus designed to offset the impact of the rise in the 5 percent sales tax rate to 8 percent next April. Some in the BOJ are known to share the market's doubts. "The BOJ is being too optimistic given there will be a sales tax hike and could be forced to downgrade these numbers later," said Takuji Aida, chief economist at Societe Generale Securities. "The BOJ may have to ease policy again in the second quarter of next year, around the time of the tax hike." TAX RISE IMPACT The economy expanded for a third straight quarter in April-June as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's stimulus policies boosted business sentiment and household spending. Manufacturing activity grew at the fastest pace in more than three years and factory output grew at the fastest pace in almost four years in October, a survey showed, a sign of firm domestic demand ahead of the sales tax increase. The BOJ revised up growth for the 2014 fiscal year to 1.5 percent from the current 1.3 percent, reflecting the expected boost to the economy from a 5 trillion yen ($51 billion) package planned by Abe to cushion the impact of the tax hike. And it maintained its fiscal 2015 forecast for 1.5 percent growth. But a slump in exports has cast doubt on the central bank's view that global growth will pick up in time to offset an expected downturn in household spending when the tax rate rises.   Wage earners' total cash earnings rose just 0.1 percent in the year to September, data showed on Thursday, reflecting the slow progress in achieving big increases in wages needed to end 15 years of deflation.
