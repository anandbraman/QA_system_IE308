© AFP/File Odd AndersenVladimir Yevtushenkov, president of the Russian holding company Sistema, in London on Feb. 5, 2005.The detention of billionaire Vladimir Yevtushenkov on money-laundering charges sent shock waves through Russia's business and political circles on Wednesday and prompted comparisons with past crackdowns on powerful oligarchs. The Investigative Committee, which reports directly to President Vladimir Putin, announced late Tuesday that Yevtushenkov had been placed under house arrest and was being investigated for misappropriation or embezzlement linked to an oil deal. The move is reminiscent of the prosecution of Mikhail Khodorkovsky, then head of the oil company Yukos, who spent a decade in jail up to 2013 on what he says were politically motivated charges. The probe into 65-year-old Yevtushenkov, who is Russia's 15th-richest man with a fortune of $9 billion (7 billion euros) according to Forbes magazine, centers on how Yevtushenkov's company, AFK Sistema, acquired the oil company Bashneft. The respected business daily Vedomosti reported earlier this year that state oil giant Rosneft was keen to get its hands on Bashneft.  In interviews published on Wednesday, Khodorkovsky pointed the finger at Rosneft chief Igor Sechin and said the arrest showed Putin was losing his grip on domestic politics. Tatyana Makeyeva/Getty Images"I see in this a total loss of control by the president, who simply does not see what is going on under his own nose," Khodorkovsky told Vedomosti. "If he did see, I doubt that he would so misjudge the situation and give such an order," said Khodorkovsky, who served two prison terms for tax evasion and fraud and was stripped of his oil company Yukos. "I still hope that our president will at some point tear himself away from his new conquests and will see what is happening in the country," he added, apparently referring to Russia's annexation of Crimea in March and the confrontation with the West over Ukraine. He said he believed Yevtushenkov's case centered on "purely commercial interest" in the oil industry, not a political conflict. Rosneft has denied any role in the investigation. Khodorkovsky was suddenly released from prison late last year and now lives with his family in Switzerland in self-imposed exile. He has accused Sechin, one of Putin's most loyal lieutenants, of orchestrating his downfall. After being pushed into bankruptcy, Yukos was carved up and sold off in opaque auctions to state companies, with Rosneft buying up the best assets. The arrest of Yevtushenkov, who sits on the board of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, sparked fears in the country's business and political circles.  "We have a really bad feeling about this... this all makes us think of a second Yukos case,"  an aide to a senior Russian official was quoted as saying. Yevtushenkov has been placed under arrest until Nov. 16 in his country residence in the elite village of Zhukovka outside Moscow, Kommersant said. He is only allowed to contact lawyers, investigators, and prison officers and is wearing an electronic bracelet, the newspaper added. AFK Sistema is a vast holding that also has major interests in the country's biggest mobile telephone company MTS, travel firm Intourist and a range of other assets. The Investigative Committee said it had launched the probe because it had "sufficient grounds to believe that AFK Sistema board chairman Vladimir Yevtushenkov is involved in the legalization (money-laundering) of property acquired by criminal means." AFK Sistema responded that the accusation against Yevtushenkov was "without foundation."  FREE AppDownload

As you'll read, the story of tulipmania involves many timeless issues like behavioral biases, malfunctioning markets, inequality, and basic economic concepts like supply and demand imbalances. Dutch tulips were the first speculative asset to see prices shoot through the roof, and then quickly crash. And of course they weren't the last.

Thomson ReutersLogos are seen outside a branch of Barclays bank in LondonBy Herbert Lash NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York's attorney general said on Tuesday that Barclays Plc's  motion to dismiss the state's lawsuit alleging the bank lied to customers about "high-frequency" trading on its private trading platform should be denied. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in response to the motion filed in July that Barclays' arguments to dismiss the lawsuit are "misguided" and "disingenuous" by suggesting the case falls outside of the scope of the state's securities laws. Schneiderman said New York's powerful securities law, a statue known as the Martin Act, has long co-existed with federal securities regulation and enforcement, and he said that the suggestion federal law should take precedence is misguided. Schneiderman's complaint, filed in June, alleged that Barclays promised to ensure the best possible price for trades but instead took steps that maximized the bank's profits. Nearly all orders were executed on its own trading platform, a "dark pool" called LX, when better prices might have been obtained if Barclays had sent trades to other stock exchanges or venues, the complaint said. The lawsuit is the highest profile case yet as U.S. authorities move to make trading more transparent and to ensure investors are not being overcharged as more and more trades are executed on dark pools and other alternative trading systems. Schneiderman repeated previous allegations that representations made by Barclays about its dark pool were false, such as protections it offered against aggressive high-frequency trading and how it routed client orders. "Barclays' false assurances are manifested in the theme set forth in its marketing material: 'Protecting clients in the dark,'" the attorney general said. Barclays has until Oct. 12 to respond, after which the case will go to trial if a settlement isn't reached.   (Reporting by Herbert Lash; Editing by Chris Reese and Steve Orlofsky) FREE AppDownload
renagrisa / FlickrNew York City A major New York State pension fund is "reviewing" whether it should follow California's lead and pull out of its hedge fund investments. "We are currently reviewing our asset allocations with the goal of maximizing our risk-adjusted return on investments," a spokesman for state Comptroller Tom DiNapoli told Business Insider on Tuesday. California Public Employees' Retirement System, the nation's largest pension fund, unexpectedly announced on Monday it would eliminate hedge fund investments. The system's chief investment officer said hedge funds are "certainly a viable strategy for some" but, "at the end of the day, when judged against their complexity, cost, and the lack of ability to scale" were an impractical investment for the state.  Business Insider subsequently reached out to both DiNapoli and New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer to find out if they would follow the Golden State's example. The consulting firm Towers Watson in 2012 ranked the city's and state's retirement systems the 16th-largest and 14th-largest pension systems in the world respectively. DiNapoli's office says he oversees almost $177 billion; Stringer's office says he oversees about $140 billion. Both New York comptrollers stressed that only a small amount of their investments are tied up in hedge funds, however — only about 3.2% or $5.6 billion for the DiNapoli's fund, for example. "The target allocation, which is currently under review, was set at 4% in 2009," DiNapoli's office added. If he decides to maintain that target, he would actually have to move more money into hedge funds. Update (10:00 a.m.): A spokesperson for DiNapoli's office clarified the review is part of a periodic process and was not connected to CALPERS' decision to pull out of hedge fund investments.  Scott Evans, the chief investment officer of New York City's retirement system, said the Big Apple's pension fund has no plans to divest from its investments in hedge funds. He pointed to the relatively small size of the city's hedge fund investment in his explanation for why he had no plans to eliminate it. "Hedge funds are an alternative asset class that can help improve the balance between risk and return. They are optional," Evans said in a statement. "Two of our five systems have opted to pass on those allocations. The other three have allocated 4-5% of assets to hedge funds. We have no current plans to recommend changes to this program."

Thomson ReutersA employee stands in the Microsoft booth during the 2014 Computex exhibition at the TWTC Nangang exhibition hall in TaipeiSEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp  on Tuesday announced an 11 percent increase in its quarterly dividend and appointed two new directors to replace two board members who decided not to seek re-election. Microsoft has increased its payout to shareholders almost every year since it introduced a regular quarterly dividend in 2004. It did not increase the dividend in recession-hit 2009, when it also laid off more than 5,000 employees. The company said Teri List-Stoll, chief financial officer of Kraft Foods Group Inc and Charles Scharf, chief executive of Visa Inc, have been appointed to the board, effective Oct. 1.

It's been three months since Janet Yellen dismissed some worrisome inflation data as "noisy." And it looks like she might've been right to ignore this data and keep monetary policy easy. But what's next? On Tuesday, the Federal Reserve kicked off its latest two-day FOMC meeting, which will culminate in its latest monetary policy announcement at 2 pm ET on Wednesday, followed by a press conference from Federal Reserve chair Janey Yellen at 2:30 pm ET. In addition to its policy statement, the Fed will also release its latest Summary of Economic Projections, which will include economic forecasts from FOMC members through 2017. There will also be new dots.  The Fed is expected to take another $10 billion off its QE program and keep interest rates between 0%-0.25%. But the big focus of Wednesday's announcement will be what the Fed says in its latest economic projections, and what Yellen says in her press conference.  To get you ready for Wednesday, here's a look at what the Fed is likely focused on ahead of the meeting, and what has happened in the three months since we last heard from Yellen after an FOMC meeting. In June, Yellen said, "I think recent readings on CPI index have been a bit on the high side but I think it's the data we're seeing is noisy. Broadly speaking inflation is evolving in line with the committee's expectations." And since then, inflation has held steady. As Business Insider's Joe Weisenthal wrote a few weeks ago, it looks like Yellen was right to call this spring's inflation data "noisy," and it might've been the call of the summer.  This chart from FRED shows that both the CPI and PCE — which is the Fed's preferred measure of inflation — inflation indicators remain below the Fed's 2% target.  FRED Back in the spring, many were wondering if the Fed was "behind the curve" on inflation. And looking at the chart, you can see that inflation did perk up during the spring, but a few months on and the consensus is that this uptick in prices was largely due to the unusual economic downturn experienced during this winter's unseasonably harsh weather.  On Wednesday morning, we get August inflation data from the consumer price index, but expectations are for this report to show inflation remains modest. Economists expect prices excluding food and energy to grow 0.2% month-over-month and 1.9% year-over-year.  In addition to inflation data, Yellen and the FOMC will also be looking closely at the labor market.  In its July policy statement, the Fed said, "a range of labor market indicators suggests that there remains significant underutilization of labor resources."  Yellen reiterated this language in her speech at Jackson Hole in August.  This summer saw a mixed bag of monthly jobs reports.  July's jobs report marked the sixth-straight month of payroll growth over 200,000, the longest such streak for the US economy since 1997. But August's jobs report broke that streak, with nonfarm payrolls growing by a disappointing 142,000, far less than 230,000 expected by economists.  And while these reports have left the economy with a 6.1% unemployment rate, labor force participation still remains low and wage growth is just keeping up with inflation. In her speech at Jackson Hole, Yellen said: "...in real terms, wages have been about flat, growing less than labor productivity. This pattern of subdued real wage gains suggests that nominal compensation could rise more quickly without exerting any meaningful upward pressure on inflation. And, since wage movements have historically been sensitive to tightness in the labor market, the recent behavior of both nominal and real wages point to weaker labor market conditions than would be indicated by the current unemployment rate." And so while some employment indicators like nonfarm payrolls are looking better... FRED ...low labor force participation... FRED ...and tepid wage growth are likely factors that the Fed is still struggling with. FRED Wednesday will also see the release of the FOMC's latest Summary of Economic Projections.  This includes long-run GDP and inflation projections from FOMC members, as well as future expectations for interest rates, included on the much-talked about Dot Plot.  The Dot Plot shows where FOMC members think interest rates will be at the end of future years, and Wednesday's release will mark the first time we get a look at where Committee members see interest rates at the end of 2017.  In June, the Dot Plot showed FOMC members holding a fairly wide range of views for interest rates at the end of 2015 and 2016, while most saw longer-run rates just below 4%. Federal Reserve This Dot Plot from Credit Suisse shows the firm's projections for where FOMC members could see rates in 2017. Credit Suisse Last week, economists at the San Francisco Fed noted that market expectations and the Fed's expectations for future interest rates appear out of whack.  The Fed's dots imply a wider range for the path of future rates than what the market is pricing in, though the Fed's expectations have a higher median projection than the market.  In their observations, San Francisco Fed economist Jens Christensen and Simon Kwan wrote that, "the public might not give enough weight to how dependent the central bank’s guidance is on both current and incoming data. Thus, the public could underestimate the conditionality and uncertainty of interest rate projections." This disconnect, however, is unlikely to be resolved anytime soon, given that these two entities have different objectives and motivations when projecting the future path of interest rates.  A big story ahead of Wednesday's meeting has also been the potential for a change in how the Fed delivers its forward guidance. In recent months, the Fed has said that interest rates will remain low for a "considerable time" after the conclusion of its QE program. Well, the conclusion of QE is almost upon us as the Fed has signaled that it will end QE in October, and many have begun asking if the "considerable time" phrase will be dropped. Ahead of Wednesday's meeting, Nomura's Lew Alexander wrote in a note to clients: "At a minimum, we expect the FOMC to add language that stresses the 'data dependence' of future interest rate decisions... We expect the FOMC to continue to state that the adjustment of interest rates, when it comes, will be 'balanced' and that it expects interest rates to converge to normal levels more slowly than employment and inflation. But in light of sustained improvement in labor market performance, and the inherent complexities in assessing their state, we expect the FOMC to drop its assessment that 'lift-off' is still a 'considerable time' away." Back in March, Janet Yellen said that the considerable time period could be "something on the order of six months," which freaked the market out.  Currently, there isn't a firm consensus on when the Fed might hike rates, but most everybody expects them to wait until sometime in 2015.  FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Eduardo MunozJeffrey Gundlach, chief executive and chief investment officer of DoubleLine CapitaWe will be hosting a live webinar and Q &amp;A with Jeffrey Gundlach on Oct. 14. To register, you must be an APViewpoint member.  To attend these events, join or login to APViewpoint today and click on the APVIEWPOINT EVENTS link on the lower left-side navigation pane. Inflationary pressures could ultimately trigger an uncontrollable spike in interest rates, according to Jeffrey Gundlach, but such predictions are likely at least five years too early. In the short run, he identified the key driver that will keep rates low – the strong performance of European bond markets. Gundlach said it is “overwhelmingly tempting” for European and Japanese investors to buy U.S. Treasury bonds, which yield considerably more than their non-U.S. counterparts. The U.S. 10-year bond, for example, yields 150 basis points more than German bonds with similar maturities. Deflation and recession in major economies in Europe is driving European bond rates lower, Gundlach said.    “Buying from foreign buyers has been more than sufficient to offset any amount of so-called tapering that has happened from the Federal Reserve,” Gundlach said. International buying of Treasury bonds, he said, is up by $600 billion year-to-date versus last year. Fed policy will keep rates low, he said. “I’m virtually certain that Janet Yellen does not want to raise interest rates,” Gundlach said. Recent easing by the European Central Bank (ECB) will add further support European bond prices. Gundlach spoke Sept. 9 on a conference call with investors. He is the founder and chief investment officer of Los Angeles-based DoubleLine Capital. A copy of Gundlach’s presentation is available here. Let’s look at Gundlach’s assessment of the global bond market. U.S. bond-market investors have benefited from remarkably strong performance and low volatility this year. The yield on the 30-year bond, for example, has fallen 73 basis points. Gundlach said that bonds have delivered the third-best year-to-date performance in the last 40 years and that downside volatility – spikes in interest rates – has been exceptionally rare. That performance is remarkable, he said, given the high level of bearish sentiment at the beginning of the year. He expects low yields to persist, despite the fact that rates are already low. U.S. rates are being “dragged down” by European bond yields, he said. “Who would want to sell U.S. bonds and buy European bonds when you’re giving up so much yield?” Gundlach asked. A strong dollar makes U.S. bonds even more attractive, he added. In his previous webcast, Gundlach predicted that the budget deficit would decrease, limiting the supply of bonds, and that pension plans would step in to buy bonds in order to lock in gains and secure their funding. Those factors have played out, he said, and will remain in place – although he noted that short interest in bond positions among pension funds is at a high level. Gundlach identified the signs investors should monitor as warnings of an impending rise in rates. Yields in Europe have increased in the last week as a result of Scottish secession fears, he said. But the French 10-year bond would have to increase to 1.75% from its current level of 1.30% before it could threaten the U.S. 10-year, according to Gundlach. Peripheral yield spreads – in Italy, Spain, Ireland and Portugal – have reverted to their pre-crisis levels. Gundlach said there is no sign of those reversing. “If Spanish and Italian bond yields start to rise on the upside, that would be bad news,” he said. “If French bond yields rise, that would be another really definitive sign that something funny is happening in terms of not having the same drag lower on U.S. yields.” He expects yields on the U.S. 10-year to remain in the range of 2.2-2.8%, as he stated in his previous webcast.

REUTERS/ Carlos BarriaA woman shops in a Louis Vuitton store during Vogue's 4th Fashion's Night Out: Shopping Night with Celebrities in downtown Shanghai, September 7, 2012.China may be getting more new wealthy individuals every year, but it isn’t necessarily keeping them. That was the finding of a new survey by Barclays Wealth Insights, which reports that 47 percent of Chinese respondents with a net worth of $1.5 million or more want to move abroad within the next five years in search of better educational opportunities, financial security, and health care. According to the report, the percentage of Chinese ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNWIs) with hopes of emigrating is the highest in the world, topping the global average of 29 percent. The United States and Europe respectively earned first and second place as their top two preferred destinations. The biggest factor driving their desire to move is an interest in finding better educational and employment opportunities for their children, which was listed as a reason by 78 percent of respondents. Also important is a better economic situation with improved security, which was cited by 73 percent of respondents, while health care and social services were named by 18 percent. Barclays Although they may want to move, the financial benefits they’re seeing from China’s rapid economic growth might be holding them back. “The reality is that most ultra-high-net-worth individuals in China are probably making money in China right now,” said Knight Frank LLP’s head of residential research Liam Bailey in the report. “So, for business reasons, they need to be relatively close. That might prevent some of them going further afield.” The high demand to emigrate among China’s wealthy has been documented by the Hurun Report as well, which published a study in June this year found that 64 percent of Chinese HNWIs had either already moved abroad or wanted to in 2013, marking a 4 percent increase from the previous year. One of the main emigration avenues for wealthy Chinese individuals has been the opportunity to take part in “millionaire visa” programs in countries such as the United States and Canada, which offered green cards to foreign citizens who invest a massive amount of money into the country’s economy. Rapidly growing Chinese demand has inundated these programs in North America, however. After Canada scratched its investment visa program in February as a result of backlogged Chinese applications, the U.S. State Department announced in August that the United States has hit its quota for its similar EB-5 program for the first time ever. As a result, it’s likely will see several otheremerging destinations such as Australia, several European countries, and the Caribbean become more popular locations for China’s rich in the years to come.

Wikimedia CommonsSteven Koukolous tweeted yesterday that Aussie dollars falls are never uniform events – “not many market crap-outs are a straight line &amp; the AUD is no different.” And so it is this morning with the Aussie a full cent off the low of the 0.8986, sitting at 0.9094. But while the forensic analysis of why the Aussie, which was falling so hard earlier in the week, has suddenly rebounded continues, the key is that this bounce is not about the Aussie dollar in isolation but rather the US dollar and positioning in regard to the pre-FOMC decision tomorrow morning. Indeed, the bounce in the Aussie over the course of the day to 0.9094 is a rise of 0.75%. Likewise, the Canadian dollar – the “Loonie” as it is known – is back at 1.0971 for a gain of 0.72% as USDCAD fell to 1.0971. And the Kiwi is back up at 0.8192 from a low of 0.8143. There is a big event risk in the FOMC but traders are clearly, in buying what used to be called the commodity bloc as one, signalling that they think the status quo of the taper will be maintained with no signs of tightening tomorrow morning. That’s a huge risk with the expected release of the infamous dot chart of Fed Governor interest rate expectations. Janet Yellen’s words at the press conference tomorrow have never been so important for currency traders, the US dollar and the Aussie. A bottom for the Aussie?

Long live the mid-size pickup!DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co. will add a third shift and 750 jobs at its Missouri assembly plant to build more of its new mid-sized pickup trucks, the No. 1 U.S. automaker said on Tuesday. With early orders for the Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon at nearly 30,000, GM decided to add the third shift at the Wentzville plant to meet expected demand. The additional shift at the plant, which also builds full-size vans, is expected to start in early 2015. GM counts on its full-size pickups, the Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra, for the bulk of its profits, but is aiming to boost its share of the overall truck market with the smaller companions that it feels will appeal to a different group of buyers. Rivals Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Group do not sell mid-sized pickups in the U.S. market. Production of the 2015-model Colorado and Canyon trucks is already under way and shipping to dealers will begin soon, a spokesman said. The trucks will go on sale in October. GM has not provided sales forecasts for the new trucks other than saying the Colorado will be more successful than its last appearance when U.S. sales peaked in 2005 above 128,000 vehicles. The 750 new jobs at the GM plant are in addition to the 1,315 jobs committed to with the launch of the smaller pickups and the addition of a third stamping press, investments worth $513 million. The plant currently employs some 2,600 people, and that will rise to about 3,350 at full capacity, the spokesman said.

REUTERS/Cathal McNaughtonA "No" campaign placard and Union flag are seen outside a cottage on the Isle of North Uist, in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland September 15, 2014.Two new polls released Tuesday show the "no" vote holding steady, just two days ahead of a vote on Scotland's possible independence from the United Kingdom.  In both polls — one from Opinium and another from ICM — the 52% of respondents said they would vote "no" on the referendum. 48% would vote in favor of Scottish independence. The 52/48 split is the same registered in a YouGov poll late last week. In all three of the polls, it's clear that the "yes" vote has gained momentum ahead of Scotland's date with destiny — but the momentum has failed to yield a majority for supporters of independence. According to the Opinium poll, among voters who say they are absolutely certain to vote, 45% say they would cast their ballot in favor of splitting off from the UK, while 49% would choose to remain in the union.  Opinium Still, the "yes" vote has picked up clear steam over the past month. In ICM's August survey on the referendum, published in The Scotsman, the "yes" vote was at 45% and the "no" vote stood at 55%. Both positions have shifted 3 points in the opposite direction. A vote for independence could cause massive ramifications throughout Europe, and it would lead to a host of immediate questions for Scotland: Would it be able to still use the British pound, which fell to its lowest level in 10 months on news of the polls? Would it be able to stay a member of NATO? And would it be able to gain re-entry into the E.U.? A "yes" vote would also likely embolden other secessionist movements throughout Europe — what geopolitical expert Ian Bremmer, the president of Eurasia Group, called the "contagion" effect.  Despite tightening polls over the last month, most analysts still expect Scots to vote "no" on the referendum.

Rolls RoyceA rendering of a Rolls-Royce Phantom Extended Wheelbase ordered by Stephen Hung.Hong Kong real estate entrepreneur Stephen Hung just placed an order for 30 Rolls-Royce Phantoms — the largest such order in company history. Valued at $20 million by the Financial Times, the fleet will be owned by Hung's upcoming Louis XIII Hotel and Casino in Macau, where it will shuttle wealthy Chinese gamblers around town. Even though the gaming haven is going through its worst summer since 2012, Hung's Louis XIII promises to take luxury to a whole new level when it opens in 2016.  For example, the most expensive suite in the 22-story hotel is expected to cost as much as $130,000 a night, The Wall Street Journal reports. "We at Rolls-Royce Motor Cars are delighted and honoured that Mr Hung has commissioned Rolls-Royce to provide the largest single order of Phantoms in history," said Rolls Royce CEO Torsten Mueller-Oetvoes in a statement. "The Louis XIII fleet of Phantoms promises to be one of most impressive sights ever seen in Macau when they arrive at the...hotel in 2016. Mr Hung’s commission reaffirms Phantom’s pinnacle position as the motor car of choice for those seeking to experience the finest luxury the world has to offer." Rolls RoyceNo passenger will ever forget whose Phantom he or she is riding in.According to Rolls-Royce, each of the 30 Extended Wheelbase Phantoms will be custom-designed by the company's Bespoke Vehicles Team. Interior accents and features will mirror the 55 year-old Hung's over-the-top style. In fact, two of the cars in the fleet will feature additional internal and external gold accents, and are the most expensive Phantoms ever commissioned. All 30 cars in the Louis XIII fleet will feature bespoke timekeeping by Graff Luxury Watches.  Although Louis XIII will have the largest fleet of Rolls Royces, it won't have the most famous hotel fleet. That distinction belongs to the Peninsula Hotel in neighboring Hong Kong, whose trademark fleet of dark green Rolls-Royces have been keeping passengers happy for decades. Louis XIIIA rendering of the 22-story Louis XIII Hotel.In addition to the fleet, Rolls-Royce will also assist in the design of the hotel's driveway. And the automaker will train chauffeurs in the proper handling the handcrafted luxury land yachts. Even more intriguing is Stephen Hung's history with Rolls-Royce. According to The Wall Street Journal, as the son of wealthy real estate investors, Hung drove a Rolls Royce to work, even as an intern with Citibank.

Advisers Are Going To Wait And See What Happens With The Alibaba IPO (Investment News) Advisers are worried that all the hype around the Alibaba IPO is reminiscent of the Facebook IPO, which flopped for people who bought on the first day. So they're going to stay out until it's all over. “There seems to be plenty of demand for the deal, but it all reminds me of Facebook,” Josef Schuster, manager of the First Trust US IPO ETF, said. “So much buzz, and they say all the order books are full, and they keep raising the price, and that probably means a lot of investors will be buying at an inflated price. “Most IPOs are overpriced at the offering, so we're going to wait until it's all over and then take a look at it,” said Theodore Feight, owner of Creative Financial Design. “We are about to see what may be the biggest IPO in history, which is increasing in price due to growing demand,” added Joseph Witthohn, vice president at Emerald Asset Management. “While the price may be justified, it is quite possible a slew of investors, who have possibly missed strong run-ups in other stocks, will want to buy this because they can't bear to think another boat might leave the dock without them on board.” Niche Taiwan Textile Companies Are Having A Moment Thanks To Millennial Fitness Fanatics (AllianceBernstein) Investors who are looking for up-and-coming growth need to look to niche Asian companies — and specifically Taiwanese textile groups, according to AllianceBernstein's Liliana Castillo Dearth. These firms have made "significant investments in functional fabrics — materials ideal for athletic apparel that's useful and fashionable," and now these investments are paying off because of the huge demand for "fashion-forward sportswear." Millennials — part of the fitness-conscious generation — are driving the demand for fashionable sportswear. And a recent Goldman Sachs report estimated that "health-conscious and hyperactive millennials will, over the next five years, go from being the smallest spenders on consumer staples and discretionary items to the biggest spends, with average annual growth of 3%-4%." Global sales of sports apparel have been steadily rising since 2007, reaching $162 billion in 2013. Euromonitor International estimates that global sales will top at $219 billion in 2018. "We think that all of this adds up to healthy growth potential for textile firms with the ability to supply Nike, Under Amour and other athletic apparel and footwear makers with clothing that's both functional and fashionable," writes Dearth. Millennial Women Are Going To Be The Next Huge Client Base For Advisers (Financial Adviser Magazine) Millennial women are increasingly delaying motherhood, in order to take advantage of the benefits from education and work. Studies show that for every year that motherhood is delayed, career earnings increase by 9%, work experience by 6%, and the average wage rates by 3%.  "The difference in labor force participation rates between men and women 20 to 24 years old reached a record low at the end of last year, according to data from the Labor Department. The rate was at 66.9 percent in August for young women, compared with 73.8 percent for young men."   Plus, more women than men hold a bachelor degree. By age 27, 32% of women have a degree, as compared with onl 24% of men. And these strides in education boost women's potential earnings power — those with a bachelor's degree made 57% more than those holding only a high school diploma in 2012. As households become increasingly dependent on female employment and earnings, U.S. fertility rates will probably continue to decline, said Mark Mather, associate vice president of domestic programs at the Population Reference Bureau in Washington. Employed married women’s earnings are now 44 percent of their families’ total, up from 37 percent in the 1970s, according to a presentation earlier this year from President Barack Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers. A Hybrid Distribution Approach Simulation Performs Well (Morningstar) Morningstar's Christine Benz took a look at how a "hybrid of an income oriented and total-return approach would have performed since 2000, the start of the dotcom meltdown." The group assumed that their "test subject" was a 65-year old couple with a $1.5 million portfolio and an anticipated 25 to 30-year time horizon. Plus, they assumed a 4% withdrawal in year one of retirement ($60,000) and a 3% annual inflation adjustment to that initial $60,000. "The hybrid approach, combined with a version of our model bucket portfolio, performed well during the time period studied. Not only did it provide cash flow in line with our planned distribution rate, but it also ended comfortably above the portfolio's starting value--reassuring, in that the period studied, 2000-13, encompassed the bursting of the dotcom bubble as well as the financial crisis from 2007-09. In fact, the value of the ending portfolio in our hybrid simulation was higher than the ending value of the portfolio in the simulation where we employed a pure total-return approach," writes Benz. Advisors Believe That The Emerging Markets Rally Isn't Ending Anytime Soon (Financial Planning) "Emerging markets bond funds topped all fixed-income categories with a 10 year annualized return of 8.3% through last month, nearly double the 4.4% return of domestic long-term bond fund," and financial advisors think that this rally isn't ending anytime soon. One major reason is because of the "relatively" high yield of emerging markets bonds. Additionally, investors are still favoring EM bonds because their home nations are "reporting faster economic growth than the United States and other developed nations." Plus, as the emerging markets' economies grow, the credit quality of emerging nations' bonds improve, according to Michael Francis, the president and CEO of Francis Investment Counsel. Higher credit quality makes the bonds more secure, which attracts more buyers — and then the bond's prices are strengthen by the increased demand. FREE AppDownload
 REUTERS/Yuya ShinoPeople use wooden dumbbells during a health promotion event to mark Japan's "Respect for the Aged Day" at a temple in Tokyo's Sugamo district, an area popular among the Japanese elderly, September 15, 2014.Stocks rallied on Tuesday as the Federal Reserve kicked off its latest two-day FOMC meeting, with the Fed set to announce its latest monetary policy decision on Wednesday afternoon. First, the scoreboard: And now, the top stories on Tuesday: 1. On Tuesday morning, we got the August report on producer prices, which showed prices were flat in August and up 0.1% excluding food and energy. This was in-line with expectations. On a year-over-year basis, prices were up 1.8% both including and excluding the cost of food and gas. Following the report, Ian Shepherdson at Pantheon Macro said, "In one line: No near-term inflation threat... The headline was held down by A 1.5% drop in energy prices, including a 4.5 drop in natural gas utilities and a 1.5% dip in gasoline... Retail and wholesale margins — called "trade services" in the report — were unchanged after three significant increases, but overall the trend in FD services is hovering around the 2% mark. These data do not pose a significant threat to tomorrow's core CPI, but we will be watching the margin numbers very closely over the next few months." 2. We're now just two days away from Thursday's Scottish vote on independence, and analysts at Goldman Sachs wrote in a note to clients that they expect the vote to be a "No" for one simple reason: "...we continue to think that a ‘Yes’ vote is unlikely: we suspect that more Scots will vote for the ‘safe’ status quo in the official vote than have indicated in opinion polls – on the eve of Quebec’s independence referendum in 1995, opinion polls suggested that the ‘Yes’ vote would win 53% to 47% but it ultimately lost 49% to 51%." 3. A report in The Financial Times on Tuesday, citing a US senior official, said that a vote for Scottish Independence "is our nightmare — Scottish independence followed by a British exit from the EU."  4. Back in 2011, rare earth elements were one of the hottest trades on Wall Street, and considered by many to a "can't lose" investment. Molycorp, one of the largest rare earth miners in the world, is down more than 97% from its 2011 highs, and in 2014 alone, the stock has fallen more than 70%. A look at the price of rare earth elements, as seen in this chart, tells you everything you need to know about the bubble that quickly inflated and popped just a few years ago.  5. Apple shares were down about 0.5% on Tuesday, but opened the day down more than 1.5% as rumors out of China suggested that the company's iPhone 6 won't be available in China until 2015. The rumor was based on a short report in the 21st Century Business Herald, but as Business Insider's Jay Yarow noted, even if the release of iPhone 6 is delayed in China, demand for the phone is still huge and the effect would likely still be seen, just in a later earnings period than might currently be expected.  6. Tesla shares were up about 2.5% on Tuesday after falling 9% on Monday, and Business Insider's Matthew DeBord reported that analysts at Morningstar see Tesla's competition is the entire auto industry. In a note, Morningstar wrote, "we consider Tesla's competition to be the entire auto industry rather than just EVs. There are far too many automakers all over the world for us to claim that Tesla's market is effectively served by a small number of players." 7. Ultrasonic, a German-based shoe company, said in a statement that its CEO and COO have disappeared and are currently untraceable. The company's CFO, who last week said he was going to leave the company at the end of September, said the company's cash funds have been transferred are no longer "in the company's range of influence." Shares of Ultrasonic listed in Frankfurt, Germany, fell more than 75% on Tuesday. 8. The Federal Reserve kicked off its two-day monetary policy meeting on Tuesday, with the Fed set to announce its latest policy decision on Wednesday afternoon at 2:00 pm ET. Fed Chair Janet Yellen is then set to hold a press conference scheduled for 2:30 pm ET. Expectations are for the Fed to take another $10 billion off its QE program and keep interest rates at 0%-0.25%. You can read Business Insider's full preview here.

Dr. Ed's Blog The weakness in the price of crude oil in the face of all the turmoil in the Middle East is extraordinary. It certainly suggests that global economic growth remains subpar. Despite a sharp drop in Libyan output recently, OPEC production continues to hover between 36mbd and 38mbd. Non-OPEC output rose to a record 54.8mbd during July. Contributing to that record high is US oil field production, which is soaring and reached almost 9.0mbd in early September. The US is now exporting 3.7mbd of crude oil and petroleum products.Dr. Ed's Blog FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Brendan McDermidThe auto industry will wait to see how Tesla does.Morningstar analyst David Whiston is cautiously optimistic about Tesla's prospects. In a note published Monday, he writes:  And yet: This is a theme we've spotted recently in financial coverage of Tesla. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas warned investors in a note on Monday that Tesla faces a cluster of "sobering" risks, not least of which is that the entire auto industry isn't going to stand idly buy and allow Tesla to own the electric-car market. It may, however, stand idly by for a few more years.Flickr/ Maurizio PesceEnjoy it while you can, Elon!It tempting to see Tesla as a runaway success story, and in the narrow confines of Silicon Valley's involvement with mobility, it is. But Tesla has also benefitted from much of its competition either going out of business (in the case of electric car startups) or turning away from electric propulsion (in the case of the major automakers).  This has distorted perceptions not just of where Tesla is now, but of where it's going. CEO Elon Musk is aware of this and has publicly questioned his company's elevated valuation (the current market cap is $35 billion). The bottom line is that if Tesla is successful, then the rest of the auto industry will see not just a proof-of-concept for the electric car, but also Tesla's business model. REUTERS/David McNewLooks good, but will it sell?But for Tesla's business model to be vindicated, much must be overcome. Here's Whiston again: At this point, it doesn't make a lot of sense for big global automakers to invest heavily in mass-market electric cars simply because Tesla has seen a massive run-up in its stock price over the past year. Tesla has a substantial technology lead in long-range batteries, but it will unquestionably struggle in the short term to build enough of those batteries to power 200-300,000 new vehicles. That's why the company is constructing a $5-billion battery factory in Nevada. But there's considerable risk in what Tesla is trying to achieve. And the major automotive players are happy for Tesla to have as much of that risk to itself as it wants. Competition from the rest of the auto industry will arrive in force once Tesla proves that its market is truly worth competing for.  FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersA bottle of Coca-Cola is shown in this photo illustration in Encinitas, CaliforniaBy Toni Clarke WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Leaders of some of the biggest U.S. corporations, from Coca-Cola Co  to Johnson &amp; Johnson , unveiled a campaign on Tuesday to reduce the nation's healthcare costs, urging their peers to embrace wellness programs to improve employee health. The newly-formed group, called The CEO Council on Health and Innovation, said it came together "to lead the U.S. business community" in improving employee and community health and reducing costs. The council's members also include executives from Verizon Communications Inc , Aetna Inc , Bank of America Corp , Walgreen Co , McKinsey &amp; Co, Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association and Institute for Advanced Health. Combined, the group said its healthcare benefits cover 150 million people. In a report released at a press conference in Washington, D.C. in conjunction with the Bipartisan Policy Center, the council called on employers to accelerate the adoption of comprehensive wellness programs that aim to improve nutrition and weight management, promote physical activity, help employees quit smoking and manage chronic diseases. The group also called on employers to make more use of  incentives to increase employee adoption of wellness programs and to modify their health benefits in a way that would encourage workers to take preventive measures to improve health. Workplace wellness programs, a $6 billion-a-year industry, are a favorite of the business community because they promise to improve productivity, cut absenteeism and reduce medical costs by averting expensive illnesses. Some employers offer their workers monetary incentives to adhere to the plans, while a smaller group of companies and organizations are introducing penalties for not complying with wellness initiatives. Several chief executives on the council described their wellness initiatives and cited success in reducing costs for both the employees and the company. But some research has shown such programs do not always cut costs as hoped. A long-running workplace wellness program at PepsiCo , for example, helped reduce costs for workers with chronic diseases by cutting down hospital admissions. But the savings for employees who were urged to make preventive changes to their lifestyle were negligible, according to a report published in January.

Thomson ReutersA screen displays the S&P 500 after passing the 2000 mark just after the opening bell over the floor of the New York Stock ExchangeBy Rodrigo Campos NEW YORK (Reuters) - For all of those waiting for a correction in U.S. stocks, here's the news: you may have already missed it. It is true that the broad S&amp;P 500 has not gone through a by-the-book 10 percent decline since October of 2011. But seven of the 10 S&amp;P 500 industry groups, the Nasdaq Composite  and the small-cap Russell 2000  have all fallen more than 10 percent at some point since, many more than once. "One of the things that has kept the rally going is that it has had rolling corrections along the way," said Jim Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis. "It's not a surging market that really runs hard and needs to be shocked. It’s been sort of self-correcting." The market's surge, with the S&amp;P pushing through 2,000 for the first time in history, has raised concerns among many analysts about the run in equities, but several factors have kept corrections brief and should limit subsequent downswings. While stocks are arguably not cheap on a price-to-earnings basis, few are alarmingly expensive. In fact, the bond market looks pricier - so investors that in the past would have switched to fixed-income are instead shifting funds around among  equity-market sectors. In addition, professionals chasing performance - hedge funds are lagging the S&amp;P badly this year - along with flows from mutual funds and overseas investors lured by the relative appeal of U.S. assets, have been steadily pumping money into stocks.  SHALLOW, QUICK PULLBACKS As a result, analysts expect more of the same: modest dips of 4 to 6 percent that quickly attract buyers due to performance-chasing or because of relative valuation. That could keep pullbacks shallow. In the last 52 weeks alone, eight of the 10 major S&amp;P sectors have retreated more than 4 percent at least three times each. Nine sectors - all except technology - have had at least a 6.9 percent drop. During that same period, the S&amp;P 500 has pulled back more than 4 percent only twice. In the past six months, the two steepest retracements in the benchmark were both shy of 4 percent. "Investors have had plenty of opportunities to take some profits, and they have," said Doug Foreman, chief investment officer at Kayne Anderson Rudnick Investment Management in Los Angeles. "But the reality is these businesses continue to grow." Earnings per share on the whole S&amp;P 500 are expected to hit a record at just above $118 for this year and climb above $133 in 2015, according to Thomson Reuters data. From a forward 12-month perspective, the price-to-earnings ratio was 15.8, according to the data, just above the historic average of 14.9. "We live in a relative world, so part of it is that in any moderate give-back people who were sitting with some liquidity earning next to zero will put it right back in the market," said David Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist at Gluskin Sheff in Toronto. The major sectors have taken turns leading the market in the past year. Four of the 10 peaked between June and July, while the other six did so earlier this month, around the time the S&amp;P 500 posted the most recent in a string of record closing highs. The earnings yield on the S&amp;P 500 was roughly 6.3 percent on Monday, a 3.71 percentage point premium over the 2.59 percent yield on the 10-year Treasury note, well above the long-term spread between the two of about 1.5 percentage points. When compared to junk bonds, where the average yield to maturity is now also 6.3 percent according to Bank of America/Merrill Lynch data, stocks still do better given the historical junk yield is 9.4 percent - suggesting those bonds are now overpriced.  LACK OF ALTERNATIVES FOR CATCHING UP A notable group among those lagging the benchmark S&amp;P 500 are hedge funds. Hedge Fund Research data shows they returned 4.1 percent in the first eight months of the year compared to a 9.9 percent return for the S&amp;P 500. "The hedge fund community has been very conservatively invested for much of this cycle," said Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Investors. He said now hedge funds were helping keep pullbacks small as they jumped into stocks after the smallest decline in fear of missing the next leg up and widening their performance gap. Support from the U.S. Federal Reserve in the form of more than a trillion dollars in monetary stimulus is often cited as the main reason for the strength in the current bull market. "The combination of pressure to perform from the pay to play crowd, i.e. professional money managers, and the Fed, is the reason why the market has behaved as it has," said Bill Fleckenstein, president at Fleckenstein Capital Inc in Seattle, a short-seller who closed his short fund around the time the market bottomed in 2009. By buying bonds and keeping interest rates low, the Fed has pushed yield seekers into riskier assets. That, some say, has also contributed to the prolonged stock market strength even in the face of uncertain world events in Middle East and Ukraine. In fact, the crisis in eastern Europe has dented appetite for European equities and is another reason why investors stick with the U.S. market. "The places for people to put money as an alternative are extremely limited," said Rick Meckler, president of investment firm LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. "That doesn't lead them to pull money out of this market and go anywhere else," he said.  (Reporting by Rodrigo Campos; editing by Tomasz Janowski and David Gaffen) FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersThe facade of the U.S. Federal Reserve building is reflected on wet marble during the early morning hours in WashingtonBy Jonathan Spicer and Ann Saphir NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - There is a distinct chance U.S. Federal Reserve officials will rewrite their strategy for normalizing monetary policy this week given signs that a roller-coaster debate over a new tool for controlling interest rates is nearing its resolution. Investors worldwide are watching the U.S. central bank's policy meeting that ends on Wednesday for hints on when it will start raising borrowing costs. But perhaps as importantly, officials may finally update a 2011 blueprint for a gradual tightening of the Fed's ultra-loose policy and shrinking its swollen asset portfolio. Many Fed officials, economists and financial market participants once believed the so-called overnight reverse repurchase facility, which has been tested for a year, would become the main lever for steering interest rates and play a central role in a new monetary policy framework. However, after a long debate over the merits and potential risks of the new tool the Fed appears close to a compromise limiting the use of the facility, Fed and industry sources say. In a reverse repo - a tool used by other central banks, but new for the Fed in such an unlimited capacity - the central bank offers Treasury securities in exchange for cash from banks, money market funds and mortgage finance agencies, effectively paying them to park funds with the Fed. Traditionally, the Fed does business only with a select group of banks, so the broad range of participating institutions raised stability concerns among central bankers. Minutes from previous meetings show Fed officials are close to agreeing on "exit principles", which they want to publish long before they start raising rates. A compromise on the new tool could pave the way for the plan to see the light Wednesday afternoon, though it is not clear if all differences have already been ironed out. "To me it would make sense, if we can achieve it, to do it in September, but we'll see," Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Richard Fisher said in an interview early this month. Officials at the Fed's influential New York branch had big plans for the new facility, designed to help drain the vast pool of reserves the central bank has created trying to revive the economy in the wake of the global financial crisis. But reservations among policymakers elsewhere in the country made it a sticking point in the effort to rewrite the exit principles that would guide any policy tightening. Like other officials, Fisher has yet to give the new tool a full embrace and Fed minutes show he is not alone. "It has utility, but we have to be careful in deploying it," he said. "I think we have to be careful that we don't become party to anything that could in any way shape or form ... have financial repercussions that we did not foresee."  UPS AND DOWNS As the New York Fed ramped up testing of the overnight reverse repo late last year, banks, funds and other market players started preparing for a major new Fed presence in short-term funding markets. In December, Simon Potter, head of markets at the New York Fed, said the tool's users were telling his team it would effectively control money market rates "if executed in full scale in the future." "When it first came through everyone thought it would be integral to monetary policy," said Gennadiy Goldberg, a strategist at TD Securities. But in January the Fed's policy-setting committee decided that its chair - Ben Bernanke at the time and now Janet Yellen - would approve any subsequent changes to the new rate during the testing, an apparent effort to wrest some control of the facility from the central bank's New York branch. Later in March, just a few blocks from the New York Fed's headquarters, Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser told an audience of bond traders that the committee, and not the New York Fed's open markets desk, would ultimately decide its fate. How to drain more than $3 trillion of funds pumped into the economy since 2008 without causing market upheaval and hurting economic recovery is the ultimate challenge for the Fed. The new facility has been a key topic in at least three policy-setting committee meetings since April and officials could still delay the publication of the exit principles if they decide the tool needs more testing. One chief worry has been that giving money market funds unlimited access to the new facility could spark "runs" from more risky assets in times of financial stress. Another concern is that it would align the Fed too closely with the non-traditional - and possibly more risky - funds, and cut out the banks. By July, most officials appeared to agree that reliance on the tool should be limited and temporary. The key policy rate, they agreed, should remain the rate on overnight lending between banks known as the fed funds rate. The federal funds rate would be pinned within a quarter percentage point corridor, with the rate paid to banks on excess reserves held at the Fed serving as the ceiling, and the reverse repo rate acting as a floor. But to curb demand for the latter the Fed now plans to pay a rate further below the target rate than officials had earlier envisioned. "This is a far cry from the original plan," former Fed Governor Laurence Meyer co-wrote last month in a note for Macroeconomic Advisers.

The state of a country’s well-being says a lot about its prosperity and progress. That’s why Gallup and Healthways team up to produce the annual “State of Global Well-Being Index,” which this year analyzed 135 world countries in five elements, including financial stability, social relationships, community safety, physical well-being, and sense of purpose (i.e. contributing to society). The researchers culled results from over 133,000 surveys taken in 2013 and ranked the countries with the highest and lowest well-being in each element, as well as those who thrived in three or more categories. Here are the countries with the highest and lowest well-being, with darker countries doing better: Business Insider/Andy Kiersz, data from Gallup-Healthways Panama had by far the best well-being ranking in the world, with 61% of its population thriving in four of the five well-being elements. Gallup and Healthways researchers claimed that Panama's cultural positivity, relative political stability, and growing economy contributed to its high ranking. But the Central American country was not thriving in terms of financial well-being, and struggled with a high poverty rate. Researchers noted this was especially prevalent for women and that ample work was needed to help women achieve financial stability on par with men. Costa Rica followed Panama in a distant second place, with 44% of its population thriving in three or more elements, followed by Denmark, Austria, and Brazil rounding out the top five. The U.S. came in #12 in the overall ranking, with high marks in social well-being and purpose. Gallup and Healthways State of Global Well BeingGallup noted that the Americas have the highest overall well-being among the world's regions: a full 33% of people surveyed were thriving in three or more of the five well-being areas. Meanwhile, Syria and Afghanistan fell to the bottom of the ranking, with only about 1% of each of their populations thriving in at least three areas. Respondents in both of these countries were described as war-weary, with little certainty about their country's future. Haiti (3%), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (5%), and Chad (5%) also made the bottom five.

In a statement, German-based shoe company Ultrasonic said its CFO, Chi Kwong Clifford Chan, has been unable to reach the company's CEO, Qingyong Wu, and COO, Minghong Wu, who apparently left their homes and are untraceable.  Chan also said most of the company's cash funds have been transferred and are no longer "in the company's range of influence." So basically the money's gone.  Shares of Ultrasonic trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange were down as much as 76% on Tuesday. Tuesday's announcement from the company also follows news on Friday that its COO, Minghong Wu, would take a six-month leave of absence for health reasons. That announcement said CEO Qinyong Wu would assume the COO's responsibilities.  Now they're both gone. And to add an even more bizarre twist to the story, in the same announcement that said Ultrasonic's COO would take a leave of absence, Chan, the company's CFO, said he would step down for family reasons on Sept. 30.  So now we've got two missing executives, who appear to have taken all the company's money, and the top executive left remaining was on his way out the door.

The Scottish independence movement will embolden other active separatist groups in Europe to win their freedom, whether or not Scotland votes to secede from the UK on Thursday. From Catalonia and Basque Country in Spain to Veneto, South Tyrol, and the island of Sardinia in Italy to Flanders in Belgium, "the precedent of the vote on self-determination will reverberate around the Continent," The New York Times writes. If you want a rough idea of how European borders would have to be redrawn if regions with a separatist agenda got their way, you can look at the map below, put together by the European Free Alliance, to which "40 progressive nationalist, regionalist and autonomous parties throughout the European Union" belong.

Nicky Loh/ReutersA textile supplier arranges cloth in Taipei, Taiwan.Investors looking for the kind of growth that up-and-coming smaller companies can deliver can’t afford to ignore Asia. We see exciting niche opportunities there — but finding them requires patience and on-the-ground expertise. This summer we visited with more than 70 senior executives at small- and mid-cap companies in seven Asian countries, including developed economies such as Japan and Singapore and emerging markets like the Philippines and Vietnam. There are opportunities in all of these countries. But we’re not talking about household names. Fewer than half of the firms we visited have much brand recognition outside the region — only 40% conduct “road shows” abroad to publicize security offerings to potential foreign investors. So, it’s easy for investors who don’t dig deeply into the Asian SMID-cap landscape to miss opportunities. Among the potential hidden gems, in our view, are some of Taiwan’s textile makers. Many of these firms have made significant investments in functional fabrics — materials ideal for athletic apparel that’s useful and fashionable. These investments are starting to pay off, thanks to a surge in global demand for fashion-forward sportswear. The demand comes primarily from members of the fitness-conscious millennial generation, defined as people born between 1980 and 2000. Millennials put a premium on healthy living and the latest styles — they eat well, exercise often and want to look good doing it. In a recent report, Goldman Sachs estimated that health-conscious and hyperactive millennials will, over the next five years, go from being the smallest spenders on consumer staples and discretionary items to the biggest spenders, with average annual growth of 3%–4%. Baby boomers’ spending on these items, by contrast, will decline by about 2% a year over the same stretch. What’s more, Euromonitor International estimates that global sales of sports apparel, which have been rising steadily since 2007, will total $219 billion in 2018, compared with $162 billion last year (Display). The AllianceBernstein Blog We think all of this adds up to healthy growth potential for textile firms with the ability to supply Nike, Under Armour and other athletic apparel and footwear makers with clothing that’s both functional and fashionable. During our travels, we found that the brightest stars in Taiwan’s textile universe are working closely with their clients to roll out fashion-forward athletic gear that can also be worn in casual, everyday settings. For many, that effort has involved working with designers such as Stella McCarthy and Jason Wu — one of Michelle Obama’s favorite designers — to produce appealing garments with bright colors and stylish digital prints; threads that look as good as they feel. The savviest companies are also innovating and filing for patents. Among the focus areas are polyester blends that pull moisture away from the body instead of retaining it, and fabrics that protect against sun, water and cold weather. As functional fabric orders from top global retailers pile up, astute firms are investing in production capacity to accommodate the thinner, stronger fabrics consumers want — capacity that’s still lacking in the region. Many firms are also putting their money to work by investing in new factories in Southeast Asia. Labor costs there are lower than in China, home to most current production. Cambodia and Vietnam are attracting significant investment, as tariff-free export arrangements with Europe, Japan and the United States have the potential to increase profit margins. We noticed that firms are also devoting more investment to automated equipment that will speed up production and cut costs. Savings on the labor front will be critical for the textile winners: Stricter wastewater treatment standards in China, Vietnam and elsewhere will require investment in green technologies. Among these is water-free dyeing, a process that eliminates wastewater altogether. In our view, firms that have the technical and financial know how to address these issues are most likely to pull away from the pack. We think investors may be able to earn a similar sort of competitive advantage by looking closely at Taiwan’s textile sector and its most promising up-and-coming firms. SMID-cap stocks around the world tend to get less research coverage than large-caps. As we’ve noted, that’s especially true of many Asian firms with limited global name recognition. While flying below the radar can make these stocks more volatile, it also creates more chances to capitalize on growth potential that the broader market hasn’t discovered yet. In investing, as in fashion, it pays to be ahead of the trend. This article originally appeared at The Alliance Bernstein Blog.  Copyright 2014. FREE AppDownload

The lender in Trump Soho, the hotel Trump unveiled on his show The Apprentice, has decided to foreclose on the property, according to the Wall Street Journal.  From the WSJ: Real-estate investor CIM Group, which holds a junior loan on the property, is taking control of the building through a foreclosure process and his hired brokerage Eastdil Secured to auction off the property. The hotel opened in 2010 and quickly became a hotspot for upscale bottle service. But as with many NYC nightlife destinations, its popularity has waned.

Julia La Roche/Business Insider With a restaurant, especially, all it takes is one bad — and badly handled — experience, and the customer may be gone for good. Around midnight on Wednesday, Sept. 3, I went to the McDonald's at 946 8th Ave and 56th Street in Manhattan. After my experience there I'll never eat at the chain again. I began the night at a party with a friend. Afterward, we were exhausted. We were also starving, so we went to McDonald's because it's convenient and open late. I ordered a Southern Style Chicken sandwich meal (I've had this before). My order didn't come out immediately, so we picked out a table and waited. When the food arrived, I opened up the bun. I'm not sure why. When I looked inside, I saw there was a white substance on the pickles, the bun, and at the edge of the chicken patty. I knew there had to be a mistake. I've had this meal before and the sandwich is served plain with a buttered bun. I took the sandwich back to the counter. When I told the cashier without being explicit what I thought the substance looked like, she laughed and said it was "tartar sauce."  The cashier asked if I wanted another sandwich without tartar sauce. I accepted.  My second sandwich arrived to my table. I inspected it and it looked OK. I ate it. The next morning, with the help of a friend and some Googling, I determined that the whatever was on my sandwich was definitely not tartar sauce. McDonald's tartar sauce includes pickle relish, which was definitely not in the substance I saw on my meal.  I sent an email with the photograph to McDonald's corporate public relations. That afternoon, Linda Dunham, the owner of the 56th Street and 8th Avenue location, called me at my desk. Dunham's late husband opened the first McDonald's in New York City. She is also the chair of Ronald McDonald House Charities, and she owns and operates multiple McDonald's restaurants in NYC. During our first phone call, she apologized and explained that there was not supposed to be tartar sauce or mayo on that sandwich. She said she would look into it. I called her back the following Tuesday afternoon when I still had not heard from her. "I apologize that I didn't get back to you yesterday," Dunham said. "What I did do is I watched some of the product being prepared and you know I don't see — other than occasionally — I don't know whether it's the grease that caused it or something like a little balloon that comes up and sometimes it has a little more white in it, but there's absolutely nothing that we add to that product other than butter." I asked her why the cashier would have called it "tartar sauce." "I could not explain that behavior," Dunham continued. "I don't think she knew. She only works the front counter. She doesn't work in the back. I don't think she understood or knew." She went on to say that late at night a limited number of people work in the store but that she did not know who was cooking. Dunham also said that cameras cover part of the kitchen, but not every part.  She assured me that she didn't think anyone did anything intentional to the sandwich. "I've been in the restaurant industry for 30-some years," Dunham said. "I've never, ever, ever, ever, ever known an employee to do something like that. That is ruining number one, a brand. That's also a person's job on the line." Dunham said that it was a "safe product" and that she had never gotten a complaint like mine.  Well, McDonald's was responsive, at least. But I'm not satisfied with the explanation. And I'm still never eating there again. Julia La Roche/ Business Insider Julia La Roche/ Business Insider  FREE AppDownload
Reuters/ Max Whittaker The hedge fund industry today is buzzing about the nation's largest public pension fund's decision to ditch all of its hedge fund investments. On Monday, the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS) said it's dumping all of its hedge fund investments because of fees and complexity. "Hedge funds are certainly a viable strategy for some, but at the end of the day, when judged against their complexity, cost, and the lack of ability to scale at CalPERS’ size, the ARS program is no longer warranted," Ted Eliopoulos, CalPERS Interim Chief Investment Officer said in a statement. We've spoken to a few managers who run money for institutions like CalPERS. The sentiment from them is that hedge funds as an asset class aren't the problem. Instead, it's the particular hedge funds CalPERS chose to invest. Investments were made largely based on the fee structure of the fund, not on the potential alpha the fund could deliver. Those funds which reduced their fees for CalPERS won the allocations.   "I think CalPERS is not a particularly good hedge fund investor," one prominent hedge fund manager told Business Insider. He cited the pension fund's lackluster annualized rate of return of 4.8% over the last ten years. "I would redeem too."  He continued: "I think it's not hedge funds as an asset class. It's the ones they invest in."   Another prominent hedge fund manager echoed that same sentiment.  "They got what they paid for since they only invested in managers who would cut fees. So the best funds wouldn't do that, so they had a mediocre portfolio." In 2013, CalPERS spent $135 million on fees for a 7.1 percent return, according to Bloomberg News.  In general, there has been a backlash against fees hedge funds charge their investors.  Fund managers are paid through a compensation structure commonly known as the "2 and 20," which stands for a 2 percent management fee and a 20 percent performance fee charge. More specifically, "2 and 20" means a hedge fund manager would charge investors 2 percent of total assets under management and 20 percent of any profits. Here is how the fee structure would be at a hedge fund with this structure that manages $100 million: If this fund earned 20 percent in a year, the fund would earn approximately $2.4 million in management fees (2 percent of $120 million is $2.4 million). They would also earn $4 million in incentive fees (20 percent of $20 million). Combining those two revenues, they would earn a total of $6.4 million on the $20 million made leaving the investor a net of $13.6 million. This was a simple example as there can be lots of variations on these fees depending on the fund. Given the struggles of major macro hedge funds of last five years and the strong performance of passive investments, it has become harder for many hedge funds to justify the fees.  "Most hedge funds offer a questionable value proposition, but everybody invests in the HOPE that they will get an upper quartile manager who is worth the fees.  But by definition, at least half, probably ¾ of hedge funds don’t offer value after fees," another hedge fund manager told us. "[There] is a general backlash against hedge fund fees, again this is down to the optics of equity performance currently versus hedge funds. In bad times they will see, if they chose their managers carefully who do not just mirror the S&amp;P 500, that they will over perform across the general cycle," a macro fund manager told us. Others think CalPERS move is symbolic of a market place that is confusing the role of a hedge fund compared with that of a long-only mutual fund. "This is more to do with CalPERS inability to meet its own performance targets and thus reduce their deficit. They are actually taking more risk and not less risk by lowering the diversification hedge funds can offer in bad times," the macro fund manager told us. "That being said, hedge funds themselves are tending to mirror the stock market because they are under pressure by their investors (the same pension funds) to produce equity like returns. These things tend to happen when volatility in equities is low so people confuse the actual risk in owning them." Folks in the hedge fund space are certainly wondering if other pension funds will follow suit. While CalPERS is the largest U.S. pension fund, they only invested in 24 hedge funds and six fund-of-funds with a total investment of $4 billion. "They were tiny. 1.5% of the portfolio? They were clearly never believers."  FREE AppDownload

APSen. Jerry Moran in 2010.Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) issued a statement late Monday evening praising the passage of the American Savings Promotion Act in the House of Representatives, which would allow banks to offer incentives and prizes to customers who establish savings account. Moran, who is a co-sponsor of a companion bill in the Senate described the act as a "commonsense" measure. "The House demonstrated that the American Savings Promotion Act has broad bipartisan support and represents smart and sensible policy that ought not be derailed by campaign politics. At a time when 44 percent of Americans have less than three-months’ worth of savings, this legislation will enable financial institutions to offer new products that will help Americans develop healthier personal finance habits that can protect their financial future," said Moran. Moran and Rep. Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas), who introduced the bill in the House, outlined their case for the American Savings Promotion Act in an op-ed on Business Insider in June. Moran concluded his statement by expressing his wish the companion legislation will pass in the Senate. "As the 113th Congress enters its final months, the Senate should act swiftly to schedule a vote on this commonsense bill and get it to the President before the year’s end," said Moran.  FREE AppDownload
People love to talk about bubbles.  In the markets today there seems to be near-constant hand-wringing about whether we're in a bond bubble now, or if the Fed is inflating a stock bubble, or if there is a bubble in student loans. And while it remains to be seen what the future holds for these assets, there is at least one asset class we can look to in not-too-distant past and say yes, that was a bubble, and boy did it pop: rare earth elements. Back in 2010, rare earth elements were supposed to be the "can't lose" investment of the decade. Rare earth elements are hard to mine and are used in a wide variety of consumer products like plasma TVs, magnets, and high-efficiency light bulbs. But despite the seemingly obvious supply-demand dynamic driving up the price of rare earth elements, eventually the price bubble in these commodities got inflated quickly and deflated aggressively.  And now, Molycorp, one the largest rare earth mining companies, is teetering on the edge of penny stock status, while the price of rare earth elements has recovered just slightly.  Assets might get expensive and then sell-off, but next time you go calling something a bubble, keep this chart in mind. This is a real bubble. Molycorp FREE AppDownload
 Mark Patterson, cofounder of the private equity firm MatlinPatterson, has seen a lot of resumes in his day. In a recent interview with OneWire CEO Skiddy von Stade, Patterson shared one big red flag for him. Over the years he's learned that when he sees someone has hopped from job to job, spending two to three years at each spot "there's something wrong with them." To him, this is worse than being a kid with no experience, and he doesn't see ambition as an excuse for it. "I have no interest in the hopper," he said. "On the positive side, especially for the young ones, I want to see where they suffered in their lives and how they overcame that. I’m looking for fortitude, I’m looking for an endurance capacity in the individual.” Patterson himself is an avid racecar driver who has driven in 24-hour races (he talks about it in the video).

Bank of America Merrill Lynch's latest survey of fund managers was released on Tuesday, and it's not a pretty picture for the UK ahead of Scotland's referendum. "As opinion polls indicated the referendum for Scottish independence was too close to call, negativity towards UK stocks deepened," said Michael Hartnett, the bank's chief investment strategist. UK equities are the least popular of all major classes this month. Sixteen percent more investors are underweight than overweight on British stocks, and a net 14% want to be underweight in the year ahead.  BofA Merrill Lynch Regional Fund Manager SurveyGlobal investors are souring on UK equities ahead of the referendum More investors are now underweight UK equities than at any point since February 2013, when economists were still warning that the UK could enter its third recession since 2008.  To make matters worse, the UK’s performance against the world is now at its lowest level since 2011, and the index still seems to be heading down. BofA Merrill Lynch Regional Fund Manager SurveyAnd the popularity of British stocks still seems to be declining There’s a huge problem here, with investors simply not able to work out what the likely economic effect of independence might be. For example, Morgan Stanley analysts suggest a “painful break-up” scenario for the UK could derail Britain’s strong growth completely and push the country into into recession. In comparison, researchers at Bank of America Merrill Lynch suggest the split might slow down by growth by as little as 0.25 percentage points.  FREE AppDownload
ReutersMarkets have been surging for the past half hour. The Dow is up 80 points, the S&amp;P 500 is up 10 points, and the Nasdaq is up 13 points. The move comes after a slew of headlines that crossed the wires in the past hour. The first notable headline came from the Wall Street Journal where Federal Reserve reporter Jon Hilsenrath predicted the Fed would "still use the language 'considerable time'" when it releases its FOMC statement on Wednesday afternoon. "Considerable time" has been used to describe the period between the time the Fed finishes tapering quantitative easing and begins raising interest rates. With employment improving and inflation showing signs of heating up, economists have been predicting that the Fed would drop this dovish phrase. The second notable headline crossed at around 11:29 a.m. ET from China. "China's central bank starts 500 billion yuan standing lending-facility to nation's 5 biggest banks," Bloomberg's Bonnie Cao reported.  All of this follows a slew of disappointing data out of China that showed growth in the world's second largest economy was slowing sharply. Here's a look at copper, which is now up by 1.8%.

REUTERS/Suzanne PlunkettDavid Whitney of Aberdeen, Scotland, plays the bagpipes near Big Ben and the Houses of ParliamentUS officials have woken up to the idea of a possible Yes outcome in the Scottish independence referendum taking place on Thursday, Sept. 18 — and they are hardly thrilled. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said on Monday that the US government has ldquo;an interest in seeing the UK remain strong, robust, and united.” The language is similar to that used by President Obama in January last year, when the administration pushed for the UK to stay in the European Union. For the US, the UK is a positive influence on the EU, and some American banks are fretting about the consequences of a British exit. A senior U.S. administration official told The Financial Times: “That is our nightmare – Scottish independence followed by a British exit from the EU." Independence would be "a tragedy for the west just at a moment when the US needs strong partners," former World Bank president Robert Zoellick added. Meanwhile, former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan told the FT that forecasts of a prosperous post-split Scotland were “so implausible they really should be dismissed out of hand.” Greenspan adds to the list of high-profile US economists who have warned against a Yes vote. And it's not just the US that's fretting. Both the Prime Ministers of Australia and Canada have intervened in opposition to the move. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott even went so far as to say "the people who would like to see the break-up of the United Kingdom are not the friends of justice, the friends of freedom."

Reuters/David GrayA rare earth mining site.Shares of rare earth mining company Molycorp are down more than 70% in 2014. But the decline of Molycorp began quickly and brutally in 2011.  Molycorp went public in July 2010 at $14 per share, right as the price of rare earth minerals started to take off.   The price of Molycorp shares quintupled within a year, and peaked at $74 in 2011. But over the last three years, the stock has been on a steady march towards $0. The 2010 surge in rare earth prices prompted ZeroHedge to write: "Ever heard of the oxides of Lanthanum, Cerium, Neodymium, Praseodymium and/or Samarium? With price surges between 250% and 600% in one quarter, you may wish you have." Rare earth elements are used to make lasers, magnets, and plasma TVs, among other products. These elements also aren't exactly rare, but aren't found in huge concentrations the way coal is found en masse in one spot, making them expensive to mine. Most rare earth productions was coming from China, which created a problem with making a fair market in rare earth mineral prices. But despite this concentration, a Bloomberg report from June 2011 cited industry analysts who saw the high prices continuing as supply failed to meet demand. Per Bloomberg: "Dudley Kingsnorth, a former rare earths project manager and now chief executive officer of Perth-based advisory Industrial Minerals Co. of Australia. 'There might be an element of speculation but I think the price rises have been driven by people who are desperate for the product.' ... Companies such as Molycorp Inc. and Lynas Corp. are rushing to restart mothballed projects to meet the gap in supply. Greenwood Village, Colorado-based Molycorp plans to bring its Californian mine into production in the second half of 2012 and double the mine’s annual capacity to 40,000 metric tons by the end of 2013… 'Until such time as Lynas and Molycorp are on-stream in the next two or three years, I don’t see much relief' from high prices, Kingsnorth said. 'Chinese export quotas are less than world demand.'" ZeroHedge wrote that this increase was due to China cornering the rare earth market. Either way, it didn't work out.  By September 2011, Molycorp shares were in a bona-fide free-fall. And while some analysts were cutting expectations for the stock (JPMorgan cut its price target to $66 from $105, but still), other firms were still rushing to the company's defense.  On Tuesday, shares of Molycorp were trading at around $1.50. In an investor presentation in June, Molycorp included the following chart showing the decline in the price of rare earth material.  When you compare the price of Molycorp stock and the price of rare earth material, the two charts look similar. This is not a coincidence. Molycorp Yahoo Finance On Sept. 11, Oaktree Capital Management threw the company a $400 million lifeline through a combination of credit lines and the sale and leaseback of company equipment. The agreement included $250 million of financing currently funded, with the remaining $150 million available in April 2016 if the company meets certain production and profitability goals. Under the Oaktree agreement, Molycorp must achieve two straight quarters of consolidated adjusted EBITDA of at least $20 million. In the second quarter of 2014, Molycorp's consolidated adjusted OIBDA was a loss of $2 million. OIBDA, or operating income before depreciation, and amortization, is a similar but not exactly the same measure as EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Companies usually report one or the other, and the difference is where the calculation starts. OIBDA uses a company's operating income rather than earnings, which could include non-operating income or items that don't recur regularly. In the second quarter, Molycorp wrote off about $20 million of what it considers non-recurring items, so using operating income was a more friendly starting point for calculating profit. Eventually, though, Molycorp will have to figure this out. But again, the core problem Molycorp has been facing goes beyond its financing agreements or commitments. The price of rare earth materials crashed and hasn't meaningfully recovered. In that June presentation Molycorp, citing data from IMCOA/Curtin University, said that rare earth demand is expected to grow at 6%-10% annually through 2017. And if this doesn't come through, the future likely remains bleak for Molycorp.

Reuters/ Eduardo MunozBill Ackman, who runs Pershing Square Capital, appears to be approaching the break-even point on his infamous Herbalife short. Shares of Herbalife slipped below $45 on Tuesday. The stock was last trading around $44.69, down over 40% since the beginning of the year. It's believed that Ackman shorted Herbalife in the mid-$40s back in 2012. CNBC's Kate Kelly reported that his average cost was $48. It's difficult to know the break-even point for certain because in October 2013 he repositioned about 40% of his $1 billion equity short position for put options in an effort to reduce risk.  For nearly 20 months, Ackman has been on a crusade against Herbalife — a multi-level marketer that sells nutritional shakes and weight-loss products. In late December 2012, Ackman gave a 342-slide presentation declaring that he was short $1 billion worth of Herbalife. It's Ackman's contention that the company is a "pyramid scheme" that targets poor people. His investment in predicated on regulators, specifically the Federal Trade Commission, shutting the company down. (The FTC opened an investigation into the company back in March.) Right after Ackman's initial presentation, Herbalife's stock plummeted. However, soon after that, shares of Herbalife skyrocketed and Ackman began to rack up hundreds of millions in paper losses. What's more is a number of other fund managers, most notably his long-time rival Carl Icahn, piled on by going long the stock. Daniel Loeb, another Ackman rival, briefly had a long position in 2013, but exited for a nice profit. Icahn, who reconciled with Ackman at a conference this summer, has said that he hasn't sold a single share of his massive Herbalife position. Ackman has said before that people should not pay attention to Herbalife's day-to-day stock price. Perhaps he's noticed today's price movement, though.  Here's a chart going back to December 18, 2012—the trading session before Ackman publicly confirmed his short position.  Yahoo!

The US is the richest country in the history of the world. Despite this, poverty continues to be a long-running problem. The Census Bureau just released a report full of statistics on poverty and income in the US. Below is the overall poverty rate and number of people in poverty. As you can see, the rate has effectively gone sideways as the number of people in poverty has been rising with the overall population. Census Bureau The Census Bureau points out in the report that the poverty rate dropped between 2012 and 2013 for the first time since 2006, although both the poverty rate and total number of people in poverty are still higher than before the Great Recession. Historically, poverty rates for children, working age adults, and older Americans have evolved in different ways: Census Bureau There was a big drop in poverty rates for all groups in the sixties. In the seventies, poverty for older Americans continued to drop, coinciding with the rollout of Medicare. Child poverty went back up in the late seventies and early eighties, dropped during the nineties boom, and then jumped during the Great Recession. The good news is that, according to the Census Bureau's report, the child poverty rate had a statistically significant decrease between 2012 and 2013, hopefully the start of a trend. As with median household income, there's a large and persistent gap in poverty rates for different races: Census Bureau Poverty rates for Black and Hispanic Americans remain over twice as high as rates for Whites and Asians.  FREE AppDownload
OECDCorporate income taxes have been falling sharply.The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is calling on member states to crack down on tax avoidance by multinational companies. The international economic body presented a historic framework that aims "to ensure that profits are taxed where economic activities generating the profits are performed and where value is created." The aim is to prevent companies from shifting profits between countries in order to lower their tax burdens. Household names such as Apple, Google, Fiat, and Starbucks have all been accused of taxing advantage of loopholes that allow them to declare profits in lower tax jurisdictions. Though there is no accusation that such moves fall outside of the law, there is a growing discomfort among policymakers about the practice. In his speech on Tuesday Angel Gurría, the OECD Secretary-General, said the proposals would:  ... tackle aggressive practices which erode the tax base of companies and artificially shift profits to low or no-tax jurisdictions. These practices erode the integrity of our tax systems, damage the capabilities of our governments, diminish the growth potential of our economies and corrode the trust of our citizens in the institutions that we created in the past 100 years. With so many countries in the developed world focused on putting their public finances onto a sustainable footing through painful spending cuts, the measures are sure to stoke vigorous debate. Even in the US, which has largely avoided the pain of austerity, the uproar over tax inversion deals where companies purchase foreign competitors and shift their domicile abroad to take advantage of lower tax rates, shows the scale of feeling that this subject can provoke. International cooperation over tax would mark a huge departure from the orthodoxy of recent decades that has seen corporation tax slashed as countries attempted to compete for these same multinational corporates.  Between 2000 and 2011 the OECD average corporate income tax fell from 32.6% to 25.4%, continuing the trend that began with the tax reforms in the UK and US in the mid-1980s. However, as the digital economy continues to grow in importance it has become easier and easier for companies to shift their activities. Given that "it would be difficult, if not impossible, to ring-fence the digital economy from the rest of the economy for tax purposes," the OECD is hoping that the spirit of cooperation with overcome the temptation to compete on tax rates to attract large firms. If larger economies move first to enact the proposals, the pressure on smaller states to do likewise could become too great to resist. Though it may not achieve all of its goals the OECD has at least forced the discussion about tax transparency back onto the international agenda. FREE AppDownload
kjc9 / Flickr, CCA gloomy chandelier hangs over a tree in Wynn Macau.Casino giants Wynn Resorts and Las Vegas Sands are selling off — both are down about 3%. The action is tied to the continuation of a dark trend in the gaming industry's largest market, Macau. This summer was the worst for casinos on the island since 2012. At that time many said that business would recover after the World Cup, when gamblers didn't have soccer games to bet on. But it didn't. To make matter worse, this weekend China released a bunch of abysmal economic data. Industrial production slowed to 2008 levels. Retail sales and fixed-asset investment disappointed as well. The government, however, has indicated that it does not want to continue stimulating the economy through housing and infrastructural investment. This does not bode well for an industry that relies on customers who feel a little rich and a little lucky. "It's just more of the same in Macau," said Jason Ader founder of hedge fund SpringOwl and an early investor in the island's casino business. "I remember you asking me about the analysts who were blaming World Cup on the weakness. I thought it was unrelated. Maybe now they will blame Scotland." Or Typhoon Kalmaegi. As one Wells Fargo analyst pointed out, the storm disrupted business in Hong Kong on Tuesday. Just Tuesday, though. What people looking for a culprit should do is look back to April, when a massive $1.3 billion heist shocked the casino Mecca. A junket operator simply walked out with $1.3 billion in cash, destabilizing the way high rollers finance their play on the island. The system works like this: China's real high rollers are taken to  Macau's VIP rooms to bet big, and those rooms are operated by junkets (the junkets can also be called VIP junket operators or VIP room promoters). Win or lose, the junkets take a cut of every wager placed in a game. That's called "rolling chip volume." In this model, investors in these junkets make 1% to 2% "guaranteed returns." Huang Shan, the guy who made off with $1.3 billion, was guaranteeing investors an unheard of 2.5%. When he took that much liquidity from the system, though, investors started losing faith. They wanted more money for their risk, but the money wasn't there. "The mass market and premium mass business remain healthy. Junket finance hasn’t recovered from its 'Lehman moment,'" Ader said, referring to the disastrous effects of Huang's heist. It doesn't help that the Chinese government is cracking down on corruption, which has made the wealthy more shy about flashing cash around. For all these reasons, over the past six months, Macau's casino industry has experienced declines almost across the board. Wynn's stock has fallen 22% while Las Vegas Sands' stock has fallen 26%. In a recent report, Macquarie analysts Larry Hu and Jerry Peng suggested that the prospect of missing 2014 economic targets could spur the government to change course and go back to stimulating the economy. That would be something of a lifeline for Macau. "The Aug data suggests that the government could not afford to rest on its laurels with regard to supporting economic growth," the analysts wrote. "Beijing pushed up growth to 7.5% in 2Q with a flurry of stimulus in April and May. But growth momentum eased quickly entering 3Q as the stimulus effects waned. As such, we expect more stimulus measures to be rolled out in the coming weeks, likely in the areas of railway, social housing, urban infrastructure, environmental protection and water projects. Moreover, with suppressed shadow banking activities, the PBoC might ramp up monthly bank loans in Sep to boost credit supply, as was the case this May and June."

The Census Bureau just released statistics on income and poverty in 2013, based on the Annual Social and Economic Supplement to the Current Population Survey. One shocking fact from the report is that large income gaps between different racial and ethnic groups have been around for a long time and continue to exist: Census Bureau The Census report also notes that the income gaps between races have not changed overly much. Real median income for each group except for Hispanics had no statistically significant change between 2012 and 2013, while on the bright side, Hispanic households did see an increase of about 3.5% over that year.

REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni  ">Thomson ReutersApplicants fill out forms during a job fair at the Southeast LA-Crenshaw WorkSource Center in Los AngelesBy Lewis Krauskopf (Reuters) - U.S. chief executive officers are gloomier about their plans for hiring and capital expenditures over the next six months, and are more wary about their sales prospects, according to a  quarterly survey from the Business Roundtable released on Tuesday. The CEOs' hiring plans were particularly weaker, with 34 percent expecting employment to increase in the next six months, down from 43 percent in the Business Roundtable's second-quarter survey. The chief executives expect U.S. gross domestic product growth of 2.4 percent this year, compared to their estimate of 2.3 percent growth in the second-quarter survey. "While some U.S. economic indicators are improving moderately, the results from our survey of CEOs seem to reflect an underperforming U.S. economy held back by policy uncertainty and growing conflicts around the world," Randall Stephenson, chairman of Business Roundtable and CEO of AT&amp;T Inc , said in a release. The Business Roundtable CEO Economic Outlook Index, a composite index of expectations for sales, capital spending and employment over the next six months, fell in the third quarter to 86.4 from 95.4 in the second quarter. An index above 50 indicates an economic expansion.  (Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli) FREE AppDownload
The U.S. economy passed a milestone of sorts in August, in that the current business cycle has now surpassed the last one in length. The prior business cycle started in 2001 and continued until the December 2007 peak, lasting 6.8 years. This is longer than the post-war average of 5.6 years, but shorter than the business cycles in the 1980s and 1990s which lasted 9 to 10 years. The question about the current business cycle’s longevity is relevant, considering peaks mark the start of recessions and turning points carry important implications for asset class performance. The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) has the final say on dating business cycles, but does so using a variety of measures and only with hindsight. For instance, the group announced in December 2008 that the last recession began on December 2007—a full year after the recession was already in full swing. Should we be concerned about the current business cycle at this point based on length alone? The short answer is no, and it generally appears this cycle has more room to run. Columbia Management One factor arguing for this is Columbia Management’s Investment Clock which is used by the Global Asset Allocation team to monitor the business cycle, its various phases and its current position. The clock uses 8 economic data series which are highly correlated to the business cycle and aggregates these into a composite indicator which is depicted in the “swirlogram” in the chart below. It remains in the expansion phase, although we do note that the positioning within expansion has been quite shallow after exiting a mid-cycle slowdown last year. This is consistent with the recovery experienced to date, which can be characterized as modest but stable nonetheless. Columbia Management A review of these factors reveals few if any candidates that would signal business cycle risks. Growth and inflation remain below the Fed’s forecasts and output gaps remain modestly negative. The Fed has yet to even begin tightening policy and it would be mathematically impossible to construct an inverted yield curve in the present environment of ZIRP. There are few if any economic or financial imbalances at present due to the muted nature of this recovery. While we expected that fragile growth would make the economy more vulnerable to shocks and recession early in the cycle, it should now also be seen as a strength in the second half of the business cycle—weak growth has not allowed economic excesses to build up. Capital investment remains low and housing investment is still recovering from the last bust. As to financial imbalances, some may point to compressed risk premiums and excessive risk-taking. Those risks are worrisome when leverage is high and financials conditions tight. But new regulatory constraints and macro-prudential policy initiatives have also prevented a build-up of financial leverage, and financial conditions continue to ease. While financial conditions may begin to tighten next year, it will be some time before they are considered tight, although the unwind of unconventional Fed policy may itself present risks. Finally, while systemic risks are inherently unpredictable, these present primarily in the global environment. They will, however, have an undeniable effect on both global and domestic growth, particularly for more open economies exposed to trade while closed economies like the U.S. may prove more resilient. So while the U.S. business cycle is likely past its mid-point, its durability should not be measured by length alone. It is somewhat ironic that what was perceived a weakness earlier in the cycle is now a strength—the tepid nature of this recovery has prevented the build-up of excesses that normally precede recessions. And it will be some time before any imbalances build up to the point of excess and stymie the expansion. So in our view this expansion has much more room to run. FREE AppDownload
BarclaysEver since the Federal Reserve dropped short-term interest rates to near-zero and started buying up bonds through its quantitative easing program, skeptics were freaked out that the unwinding of easy monetary policy would mean doom for the financial markets. But stocks and the dollar have been rallying, even with the Fed tapering quantitative easing and warning the markets that higher rates are around the corner. A new Barclays survey of 972 global investors shows that fear of Fed policy withdrawl is way down from a year ago. The top worry: geopolitics. Of course, the risk rankings differ for various types of investors. "Equity investors see geopolitical turmoil as the biggest risk for equities followed by Fed policy withdrawal, while the opposite is true for credit investors," Barclays Guillermo Felices writes. "This suggests that equity investors see tighter Fed policy as limiting the upside rather than derailing the asset class. To reiterate, stock market investors see "tighter Fed policy as limiting the upside rather than derailing the asset class." This confirms the ongoing theme of bears evaporating from the market. Overall investors generally remain bullish, particularly on stocks. "More than half of the respondents said they believed equities would offer the best returns over the next quarter," Felices said.

Thomson ReutersFile photo of a sign for Bank Street and high rise offices in the financial district Canary Wharf in LondonBy Clare Hutchison LONDON (Reuters) - The banking sector's long and painful restructuring accounted for a further 1.2 percent fall in staff numbers at Europe's biggest lenders in the first half of the year, data compiled by Reuters shows, with little prospect of an upturn any time soon. Forced to hold more capital against risky assets since the imposition of new regulations after the financial crisis, Europe's top lenders have been shrinking steadily to counter the resulting loss of profitability in some areas of their business  while a crackdown on proprietary trading has cut off a valuable source of supplementary revenue. Of the 25 of Europe's 30 largest listed banks that disclose employee numbers for the six months to the end of June, including Barclays , Deutsche Bank  and UBS , headcount fell at 16. Though nine of the banks added staff, total jobs across the group fell by 21,135. About half of the drop is attributable to Dutch lender ING  no longer including Indian offshoot ING Vysya Bank in its headcount figures, but it remains clear that banks are becoming less significant employers. The trend is even more pronounced in the United States, where the four biggest banks by assets - JPMorgan , Bank of America , Citi  and Wells Fargo  - cut 23,300 jobs in the first half of the year. That takes the total for the past 12 months to more than 52,000 - about 5 percent of their combined workforce. The pace of decline in Europe was slightly slower than in 2013 when the 25 banks together cut about 63,000 jobs over the full year, but financial services recruiters say that more swinging cuts cannot be ruled out. "Banks in 2014 do not hesitate to shut down businesses that are loss-making ... there's (no longer) any shame in that," said Jason Kennedy, chief executive of Kennedy Group, a recruitment firm specializing in investment banking and hedge funds. "New-age banks have fewer people, less product and are less profitable." Calculations by Reuters show that while European banks improved their balance sheets by 530 million euros ($685 million) in the first half, profitability remained well below targets.  VICIOUS CIRCLE Royal Bank of Scotland , which was bailed out by the British government in 2008, made some of the deepest cuts. Its workforce shrank by 5,000 as it reduced the number of contractors it employs, streamlined operations and sold the Chicago-based division of its U.S. bank Citizens. Recruiters said that most job cuts have come in investment banking, which has been hit hard by the tougher capital rules and low interest rates. British lender Barclays has axed 2,700 jobs at its investment bank this year as part of a wider cull of 19,000 roles over three years. Back-office roles also remain at risk, while greater use of mobile banking poses a threat to branch staff. Deutsche Bank analysts have forecast that Britain will need only 500 bank branches in 10 years' time. Britain's six largest banks currently have nearly 8,000 branches. Recruitment specialist Kennedy says that job losses could be exacerbated by a recent focus on cuts at managing director level. He says that such moves limit promotion prospects and, combined with an EU bonus cap, sap motivation and productivity, making further cuts more likely. "(Bankers) think, 'I'm not going to get paid any more if I work 20 hours (a day) ... why should I go crazy?' Revenues are coming down because of that and it's a vicious circle," he said. Even if the economic outlook picks up, banks are unlikely to go on any hiring sprees as they adjust to the new shape of their organizations and keep a wary eye on market volatility caused by wider geopolitical concerns, such as the situation in Ukraine. "I would like to think by the early part of next year we're probably going to start to see some forward momentum, however... it's still a little bit of a crystal ball way of seeing things," said Miles Stribbling, a director at recruitment firm Phaidon International. Those that bucked the trend by hiring staff were likely to have done so to beef up regulatory compliance functions, Stribbling said. Nordea , the Nordic region's biggest lender, strengthened its IT services with almost 300 extra staff and Sweden's Swedbank  boosted headcount by 417 to expand advisory services for bond issues and corporate finance.

REUTERS/Gary HershornA UPS delivery man struggles to push a cart through Columbus Circle as snow falls in New York January 21, 2014.UPS is hiring a lot of people for the holiday season. In an announcement on Tuesday, the shipping giant said it will hire 90,000-95,000 seasonal employees, "to support the anticipated holiday surge in package deliveries that will begin in October and continue through January 2015."  This time last year, the company announced it would employ 55,000 temporary workers. But eventually, they were forced to crank that number up to 85,000 temporary. According to its latest 10-K filed with the SEC, as of December 31, 2013, UPS had about 395,000 employees. UPS said it expects holiday delivery volume to increase compared to a year ago, when the company found itself overwhelmed by orders leading to some packages ordered for Christmas delivery arriving late.  For some quick perspective on the scale of UPS' seasonal hiring operation, its announcement means the company plans to hire roughly the entire population of cities like Macon, Georgia, Yuma, Arizona, and Brockton, Massachusetts.  FREE AppDownload
ReutersIs anyone trading? Not really. Except HFT players and corporate CFOs executing the buybacks that generate their compensation packages. You got a 7%+ gain in the S&amp;P this year on basically nothing and for no reason other than float-shrink initiatives that have zero to do with fundamentals. For every Disney, a company that is truly killing it right now, there are a dozen stagnant names masking slowing growth with a smaller overall pie to spread profits across. If IBM and McDonalds were trading on the actual condition of their respective businesses, the Dow would be 500 to 1000 points lower. But they’re not, and this is why short-term price predictions based on fundamental research are moronic, generally speaking. Because this is not at all unusual. Distortions based on non-fundamental factors are a permanent feature of both bull and bear markets. 1 +1 doesn’t equal 2 in the short run. Back to Buybackpalooza… Wall Street Journal (emphasis mine): Corporations bought back $338.3 billion of stock in the first half of the year, the most for any six-month period since 2007, according to research firm Birinyi Associates. Through August, 740 firms have authorized repurchase programs, the most since 2008. The growth in buybacks comes as overall stock-market volume has slumped, helping magnify the impact of repurchases. In mid-August, about 25% of nonelectronic trades executed at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., excluding the small, automated, rapid-fire trades that have come to dominate the market, involved companies buying back shares. According to Barclays, companies in the second quarter spent 31% of their cash flow on buybacks, the most since 2008 and up from 14% at the end of 2009. At the end of the second quarter, nonfinancial companies in the S&amp;P 500 index held $1.35 trillion of cash, down from a record of $1.41 trillion at the end of last year, according to FactSet. LOL. If no one’s involved with the market directly – apart from buybacks and tradebots – then theoretically whatever sell-off may come should do very little damage to the real economy.

REUTERS/Kim Kyung-HoonApple CEO Tim Cook in ChinaApple is down 1.6% this morning in pre-market trading. The drop seems to be due to a report from China's 21st Century Business Herald that says the iPhone 6 won't be in China until 2015. Street Insider picked up on the 21st Century Business Herald story.  Apple has not said when the iPhone will be in China. Street Insider says, "there was a brief post that the devices would be available on September 26th. That has since been removed from Apple's website." If the iPhone 6 isn't in China until next year, it could impact sales for the holiday quarter, which is why the stock is down. However, in a weird way, it could be okay for Apple since it would smooth out the sales cycle. Lately, Apple's sales are loaded in the holiday quarter, then get progressively smaller through the year. If the iPhone 6 started in China in January or February, it would add another monster quarter for Apple's earnings.  A delay would also help Apple if it has trouble making the iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus. The 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus already seems to be in short supply. So, if Apple immediately started selling it in China, then it would add more strain to the manufacturing line, which doesn't really help Apple. At the very least, this shouldn't impact iPhone sales overall. If Chinese consumers want an iPhone, they are generally going to wait for the new model. They aren't going to suddenly scramble for and Android phone.  Of course, all of this is based on the assumption that the 21st Century Business Herald is right. And we don't know if it is or is not.  FREE AppDownload
Mike Nudelman/Business InsiderDonald Trump Real estate mogul Donald Trump says he may start investing in the embattled Atlantic City, New Jersey, casino and hotel industry again. The television personality's name graces the Trump Taj Mahal and Trump Plaza, owned by Trump Entertainment Resorts, Inc., but he left the company in 2009. The city's resort industry has since been plagued by financial difficulties. Trump Entertainment filed for bankruptcy a week ago, saying that "absent significant expense reductions, the Trump Taj Mahal is expected to close on or shortly after Nov. 13." But Trump signaled Tuesday morning that he is looking at giving the casinos a boost. "I left Atlantic City years ago, good timing. Now I may buy back in, at much lower price, to save Plaza &amp; Taj. They were run badly by funds!" Trump exclaimed on Twitter. "It is so sad to see what has happened to Atlantic City. So many bad decisions by the pols over the years - airport, convention center, etc." Trump, who is often accused of publicity stunts, has previously assailed the local Atlantic City political establishment for some of the beachfront resort's struggles, including an allegedly flawed convention center. "A lot of people say when I left that's when it went bad," Trump said of Atlantic City in August. "In one way I'm honored by that statement. But in another way, I feel badly about Atlantic City." Philadelphia magazine first reported Trump's potential interest in rescuing the casinos.    FREE AppDownload

IMFWith a name like “shadow banking” it must be bad, dark, sinister and a little bit shady. “This is unfair,” say two International Monetary Fund experts: Steven Barnett, a Division Chief in the Asia and Pacific Department, and Shaun Roache, the IMF’s Resident Representative in Hong Kong. The two look at the country’s shadow banking system, which feeds increasing amounts of finance to corporate China, in a new IMF blog post. There are various names for shadow banking including “nonbank intermediation”, a phrase used in IMF’s 2014 Global Financial Sector Report. Global interest in China’s shadow banking, and the debt flowing from it, stems mainly from its rapid growth since the financial crisis in 2008. This is the pink part in the chart  above which has more than tripled since 2008. It also accounts for half of the increase in overall credit to the economy or total social financing, which is higher than total bank loans. The IMF experts ask: is shadow banking a sweet smelling flower or a thorny bush? They say both. On the plus side, the expansion of nonbank intermediation marks progress in financial development. It benefits companies by providing alternative ways to borrow. And, it benefits households, by giving them more investment opportunities, which is especially important given the ceiling on deposit interest rates. Therein, however, also lays the thorn. Shadow banking provides an opportunity to circumvent regulations, such as the deposit interest rate ceiling (but there are many others). For example, rather than putting money in a deposit, a bank’s customer could buy a wealth management product from the bank that offers a higher return. This wealth management product, in turn, may invest in equities and bonds but can also, subject to a limit, invest through shadow banks in assets that look a lot like bank loans. Shadow banking moves outside of formal banking which has safeguards such as capital requirements, provisions against loan losses, loan to deposit ratios, well-established supervision and regulation. “The regulators and supervisors are trying to keep up with this fast-moving sector, with some recent success, but it remains a huge challenge,” the IMF experts write. However, the IMF estimates suggest China’s shadow banking sector is small compared to the rest of the world. The experts say the IMNF’s Global Financial Stability Report to be released next month uses an estimate of 35% of GDP, as it subtracts corporate bonds (nearly 20% of GDP) from the shadow banking. Here’s how China’s shadow banking looks compared to the rest of the world:IMF There’s more detail here. This article originally appeared at Business Insider Australia.  Copyright 2014.

REUTERS/Yves HermanLast week’s stock losses were partly a reflection of investors looking ahead to the two big news events on tap for this week: the Scottish independence vote on Thursday and the Federal Reserve (Fed)’s statement on Wednesday. Here’s my take on what this week’s major events could mean for investors. The Scottish Referendum. As I write in my new weekly commentary, over the past two weeks, several polls have suggested a realistic chance that the people of Scotland will vote for independence in this week’s referendum. While the vote is obviously most important for the U.K., a vote for independence would have broader significance, particularly for the rest of Europe. Given that Scotland is typically more pro-European Union (EU) than the rest of the U.K., Scottish independence could raise the odds of an eventual EU exit by the U.K. It may also embolden other separatist movements, including that of Catalonia in Spain. For now, I still expect a narrow victory for a continued union. However, a “yes” is certainly possible and would create massive uncertainty, both economic and political, for the United Kingdom and potentially the broader EU. At the very least sterling and other U.K. assets would likely come under additional pressure. The September Fed Meeting Statement. Market watchers will be paying close attention to Wednesday’s Fed statement for signs of the timing of a Fed rate hike. Our expectation at BlackRock is that there’s a good chance the Fed will change its language, i.e. adopt a less accommodative stance, in next week’s statement, meaning an earlier-than-expected rate hike could be on the horizon. Last week’s retail sales numbers provided more evidence that the U.S. economy should grow faster in the second half of the year. Outside of household spending, most economic measures – notably manufacturing and housing-related numbers – have been substantially stronger than expected. The consistently strong data has pushed 10-year yields up to 2.6%, the highest level since early July. The move on the short-end of the curve has also been significant. Following the release of a San Francisco Fed note suggesting that investors may be underpricing the potential for an early hike, the yield on the 2-year note approached 0.6%, the highest level since spring 2011. And the rate rises are likely to continue if the Fed statement provides any signs of an early rate hike. As such, investors may want to familiarize themselves with these ideas for positioning portfolios as rates start to rise. FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersOPEC Secretary General Abdullah al-Badri addresses a news conference at the EU Commission headquarters in BrusselsVIENNA (Reuters) - OPEC Secretary General Abdallah El-Badri told reporters on Tuesday he expected the group to lower its oil output target when it meets next in late November. Badri was asked if OPEC's 30 million barrels per day output target would still be appropriate next year. "No, I don't think so," he said. "I think our production will be maybe 29.5 in 2015, not 30 million barrels per day." Badri said OPEC output often fluctuated slightly around its output target, but was pressed on whether he was referring to a possible change in the output target. "I think our target will be lower, maybe by 500,000," Badri said. He told reporters he expected that oil prices will climb back from recent losses. "Everybody knows that the price is declining now for the last two months, I don't think this trend will continue. We are predicting that (the) price will come up by the end of the year," Badri said. "I have seen a lot of oil prices coming up or down and I think this is fluctuation of seasonal behavior," he added.

Thomson ReutersThe head offices of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. are seen in Laval, Quebec(Reuters) - Allergan Inc  and its suitors Pershing Square Capital Management and Valeant Pharmaceuticals Inc  settled their pending litigation before the Delaware Court of Chancery and agreed to hold a special shareholder meeting on the originally scheduled date, Dec. 18. Billionaire William Ackman's Pershing Square and Canada's Valeant sued the maker of Botox anti-wrinkle treatment last month, alleging that Allergan was trying to avoid a special meeting to give it time to find an alternative deal. Allergan subsequently set the meeting for Dec. 18. Pershing Square, Allergan's largest shareholder with a 9.72 percent stake, and Valeant made a hostile offer for Allergan in April. Since then, Allergan has been fighting for investor support for its own stand-alone plan that includes cost cuts and making an acquisition of its own. To force the company to the table, Ackman has been pushing for a special meeting where he hopes to replace most board members with his own nominees, who he expects will be more receptive to Valeant's bid. Allergan said late Monday it continues to believe that Valeant's unsolicited exchange offer is "grossly inadequate" and urged shareholders to reject the offer. Allergan's shareholders of record Oct. 30 will be entitled to receive notice of and vote at the Dec. 18 meeting. Allergan is pursuing an existing litigation in California but will no longer seek the invalidation of any special meeting requests or seek to postpone or cancel the meeting, Pershing Square said early Tuesday. In August, Allergan filed a civil lawsuit in California, accusing Valeant Pharmaceuticals and Ackman of violating securities laws by using insider information as they prepared a takeover bid for the drug company. "Valeant and Pershing Square believe that Allergan's claims and request for relief in the California litigation are entirely without merit and will ultimately be rejected," Pershing Square said in a statement.

In a new SEC filing, Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba raised its IPO pricing range to $66-$68 per share from $60-$66. At the midpoint of the new range, the company would raise about $21.4 billion, with the value of the company set at a bit more than $165 billion. Alibaba prices on Thursday evening and goes public on Friday. Germany Is Cold. Germany's ZEW index of investor confidence fell to 6.9 in September, down from 8.6 a month ago. While this was slightly better than the 5.0 expected by economists, it was nevertheless the lowest reading since December 2012. "Eurozone sentiment indicators continue to point to downside risks ahead, with political risks from ongoing tensions in Ukraine, and the uncertainty over the Scottish independence vote later this week the main factors weighing on investor sentiment this month," said Pantheon Macroeconomics' Claus Vistesen. "Additional easing by the ECB will help, but has not been enough, so far, to turn investor optimism around." China's Investment Inflows Are Plunging. "China's foreign direct investment inflows in August fell to a low not seen in at least 2-1/2 years, underscoring the challenges to growth facing the world's second-biggest economy," Reuters Siaoyi Shao and Koh Gui Qing reported. "China attracted $7.2 billion in foreign direct investment in August, the Commerce Ministry said on Tuesday, down 14 percent from a year earlier and at a level not seen since February 2012." This follows a slew of data confirming a major slowdown. Markets Are In The Red. Everything's red. In Europe, Britain's FTSE is down 0.6%, France's CAC 40 is down 0.5%, and Germany's DAX is down 0.4%. In Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng closed down 0.9%. Dow futures are down 27 points and S&amp;P futures are down 2.9 points. French Prime Minister Says The Economy Could Be ... In Trouble. France's Manuel Valls has some colorful language to describe the state of things. "Valls is now privately admitting 'in three to six months, if the situation isn’t reversed, we’ll be foutu', according to Le Monde," Business Insider's Mike Bird reports. "The word foutu has a number of equivalents in English, including the f-word, ruined, or damned. The Times translated the word as "knackered,"which has a similar but more PG-rated meaning." Investors Are Bullish. "Investors remain bullish on equities, despite the risks posed by Fed policy normalisation and geopolitics, according to a Barclays survey of 972 global investors," Barclays' Guillermo Felices said. "More than half of the respondents said they believed equities would offer the best returns over the next quarter. Meanwhile, geopolitical developments, with 31% of responses, comprise investors’ main concern over the next 12 months." Hedge Funds Get A Devastating Blow. "The California Public Employees’ Retirement System plans to divest the entire $4 billion that it has with hedge funds, saying they’re too expensive and complex," Bloomberg's Michael Marois reported. "The decision to eliminate 24 hedge funds and six hedge fund-of-funds, isn’t related to the performance of the program, said Ted Eliopoulos, the interim chief investment officer. The board of the $298 billion pension, known as Calpers, hasn’t decided where to invest the money after the pullout, which will take about a year, he said." Calpers reported paid $135 million in fees to hedge fund in the latest fiscal year. It's Buybackpalooza. "Companies are buying their own shares at the briskest clip since the financial crisis, helping fuel a stock rally amid a broad trading slowdown," the WSJ's Dan Strumpf reported. "Corporations bought back $338.3 billion of stock in the first half of the year, the most for any six-month period since 2007, according to research firm Birinyi Associates.

REUTERS/Cathal McNaughton Goldman Sachs is out with a Q&amp;A on the Scottish independence referendum. They point out that while the polls are narrowing, betting markets still think that NO is much more likely than yes. How come? It call comes down to this fact, as stated in the report: That said, we continue to think that a ‘Yes’ vote is unlikely: we suspect that more Scots will vote for the ‘safe’ status quo in the official vote than have indicated in opinion polls – on the eve of Quebec’s independence referendum in 1995, opinion polls suggested that the ‘Yes’ vote would win 53% to 47% but it ultimately lost 49% to 51%. This is what David Cameron et. al. have to hang their hat on. That at the last second, voters will just think it's too much of a risk to pull the lever for YES, and that even if YES has a majority of support at the moment (which it doesn't) then NO will win in the final counting. All that being said, there's no question where the momentum lies. These charts from the report show YES clearly gathering steam heading into Thursday's vote. Goldman Sachs    FREE AppDownload
AFP Photo/Jung Yeon-JeSouth Korean Finance Minister Choi Kyung-Hwan speaks during a press conference in Seoul on September 16, 2014.South Korea's finance minister said Tuesday that "alarm bells" were ringing over Asia's fourth largest economy, and warned of the sort of protracted slowdown that hit Japan in the 1990s. While stressing that South Korea's fiscal position remained "very strong" and provided a lot of room for maneuver, Choi Kyung-Hwan said action was needed to avoid a damaging and extended slump. "Alarm bells are ringing that the economy is falling into a low level equilibrium" trap of stagflation, where both economic growth and price hikes become stagnant and both domestic consumption and overseas exports slump, he told journalists. "Unless we respond in a timely manner, the Korean economy might take the road of Japan's lost decades," he added. South Korea unveiled a 41 trillion won ($40 billion) stimulus package in July when Choi warned of a risk of recession after the economy grew at its slowest rate for more than a year in the second quarter. Citing sluggish domestic demand in the wake of a devastating ferry disaster in April, the finance ministry also cut its forecast for economic expansion this year to 3.7 from 4.1 percent. AFP Photo/Truth LeemThe stimulus includes 11.7 trillion won in expanded fiscal spending and 29 trillion won in extra financing support. The lion's share will be spent in the remainder of this year, with 3.0 trillion won earmarked for the beginning of 2015. "We are implementing stimulus packages but then that is to deal with sentiment that has been dampened by the Sewol ferry disaster," Choi said. "We are making sure that we are doing this at an acceptable level ... the fiscal position will further improve over the long run," he said. The central bank cut its key interest rate by 25 basis points to 2.25 percent last month, but Choi stressed that the rate remained high among developed countries. "So there is still policy maneuvering room," he said. Copyright (2014) AFP. All rights reserved.  FREE AppDownload
AFPPeople arrive for the premiere of Amazon Prime's 'Transparent', at the Ace Hotel in Los Angeles, California.Online retail giant Amazon celebrated the launch of a new original show it hopes will help catch up with streaming pioneer Netflix. "Transparent," which had a red-carpet unveiling in Los Angeles on Monday, features a transgender character in the central role of a show which has already generated strong critical buzz. "No one can ever doubt that the TV model has changed for good. Amazon, with its ability to draw in name talent, is impressively building on what Netflix and (rival streaming service) Hulu are doing," commented the Hollywood Reporter. "This is huge, it's a game changer. There is nothing like this on television," its main star Jeffrey Tambor told AFP on the red carpet. "I couldn't be more proud." AFPJeffrey TamborIt is not Amazon's first foray into producing its own original content -- political comedy "Alpha House" debuted last year, but has so far failed to win the acclaim of Netflix series like "House of Cards" and "Orange is the New Black." "House of Cards" was the first online only show to win major awards nominations -- and a win last year for big-screen director David Fincher, while "Orange is the New Black" won two Emmys this year. The pilot episode of "Transparent" is already available, while Amazon has taken a leaf out of Netflix's book by releasing the whole season to binge watch on September 26, rather than airing an episode per week. The half-hour dark comedy stars the lugubrious Tambor -- from Netflix's "Arrested Development" -- as father Mort Pfefferman coming out as transgender Maura to his three adult children (who have their own secrets to divulge too). The cast of the show, which is definitely for an adult audience, also includes Gaby Hoffman of the hit series "Girls." Adding to its creative heft it is directed by Jill Soloway, an Emmy-nominated writer on cult series "Six Feet Under" who won a directing award at the Sundance Film Festival last year for "Afternoon Delight." "Artistically, it's been a dream come true. I absolutely got to make the show I wanted to make," Soloway said, when the Amazon series was announced in August. "I am beyond excited to share 'Transparent' with the world through Amazon. Transgender roles in comedies are nothing new -- "Orange is the new Black" features Laverne Cox, who made it to the front page of Time magazine in her role as Sophia Burset. But a transgender main character is rarer, giving the series -- the title of which is a play on words involving a gender-bending parent -- an edge in a crowded new market.AFPActress Alison Sudol arrives for the premiere of Amazon Prime's 'Transparent.' Soloway said the casting of Tambor wasn't difficult. "Luckily I didn’t really have to think about it, because from the very moment I had the idea in my head, Jeffrey was Mort to become" Maura, she told the Hollywood Reporter. "It wasn’t a decision, it was an intuitive feeling thing," she added. Netflix and Amazon have taken starkly different paths: whereas Netflix went straight for heavyweights Spacey and Fincher, and even ordered two seasons straight at once, Amazon was much more cautious. The online retailer's approach has been much more inter-active: in 2010 it launched a process which produced traditional pilot episodes, which it then put online for free to gauge audience reaction. Only then did it order a whole season. Critics have lavished praise on what they have seen so far. "It's a nuanced, gorgeous first half-hour, brilliantly performed and laced with melancholy and humor; you could confidently put it up against the best HBO or Showtime half-hour pilots of recent years," wrote Time magazine's reviewer. "And the fact that platforms like Amazon now exist to give shows like this a chance says that not only Maura Pfefferman, but the TV business itself, is going through an exciting transformation," he said.

The independent National Institute for Economic and Social Research (NIESR) has warned that an independent Scottish state would fail within a year if Scotland unilaterally takes the pound as its currency and reneges on its share of UK debt. In a note Angus Armstrong and Monique Ebell write (emphasis added): If Sterlingisation is combined with repudiating Scotland’s fair share of UK debt we expect this regime would fail within a year. Leaving aside that taxpayers in the rest of the UK would each face an additional £5,900 in debt, we believe that this ‘opportunistic’ behaviour would be seen as a default. As a result Scotland would be outside of the EU and capital markets leading to unprecedented degree of austerity and the eventual a collapse in the currency regime. Scotland would be better off introducing its own currency without losing its foreign exchange reserves first. Although the Yes campaign have yet to commit to an alternative plan to a currency union with the rest of the UK, which all three major parties in Westminster have ruled out, Armstrong and Ebell have pieced together a likely Plan B based on statements made by First Minister Alex Salmond. In his live TV debates against the Better Together campaign's Alistair Darling, Salmond argued that an independent Scotland would still be able to continue to use the pound irrespective of the outcome of the vote. He told his audience that the currency "belongs to Scotland as much as it belongs to England" and threatened that Scotland would walk away from its share of the national debt if a currency union were refused. If this is the pro-independence campaign's Plan B, however, it risks isolating an independent Scotland from international capital markets for up to a decade and forcing harsh budgetary constraints as a consequence. The paper suggests that if Scotland's repudiation of its share of national debt is seen as a default then investors will be unwilling to extend further credit to the new nation: The most important lesson from the sovereign debt default literature is not the higher borrowing costs, which are very much specific to each event. Moody’s reports that those states which default cannot borrow for an average period of 5.6 years up to final resolution and then 4.4 years afterwards. In other words, 10 years out of the market. A perceived default would also throw Scotland's plan to join the EU into doubt. As the authors point out, Germany in particular is likely to be unwilling to accept a country that has recently walked away from its debt obligations into the fold whilst it continues to press for painful reforms in struggling eurozone states such as Greece. The paper ends with a piece of advice if the Yes campaign wins the vote on Thursday: Introducing a new Scottish currency has always been the most sensible option. We would recommend this is carried out before losing £7bn of foreign exchange reserves rather than after. Voters might also question whether Salmond ought to have formed a more credible Plan B before asking them to decide on Scotland's future for the next 100 years. FREE AppDownload
AP ImagesJeff BezosWASHINGTON (Reuters) - A joint venture of Boeing Co &lt;ba.n&gt; and Lockheed Martin Corp &lt;lmt.n&gt; plans to announce on Wednesday that it will team up with Blue Origin, a company run by Amazon.com Inc &lt;amzn.o&gt; founder Jeff Bezos, to develop a new rocket engine, a source familiar with the plans said. Officials at Boeing and Lockheed declined comment. No comment was immediately available from Blue Origin or United Launch Alliance (ULA), the Boeing-Lockheed venture that uses Russian-built engines to power some of its rockets. ULA had sent out a request for information asking the U.S. aerospace industry earlier this year for ideas on how to replace the Russian-built RD-180 that powers ULA's heavy-lift Atlas 5 rockets, which are used to launch many U.S. military and spy satellites. Tensions with Russia over its actions in Ukraine have raised concerns that Russia could cut off deliveries of the RD-180 engines, according to U.S. officials, who hope to start funding work on a U.S. alternative in the Pentagon's 2016 budget. The partnership agreement will pit Bezos against Elon Musk, founder and chief executive of Space Exploration Technologies Corp, or SpaceX, which is seeking certification from the Air Force for its own Falcon 9 rockets. The certification was due to be completed by the end of this year, but may now slip into next year, according to U.S. officials. They said the process may be slowed while officials look into the recent explosion of a SpaceX experimental rocket that uses the same engine as the Falcon 9. SpaceX is also competing with Boeing and privately held Sierra Nevada Corp. for a NASA contract to ferry astronauts to and from the international space station. NASA is expected to award that contract to one or more bidders on Tuesday, according to two sources familiar with the process. Boeing is poised to win the lion's share of that work, according to the Wall Street Journal, which also reported the expected ULA teaming agreement with Bezos. Boeing would benefit from development of a new U.S. alternate rocket engine, since its commercial crew capsule would also be launched by the Atlas 5 rocket, industry officials said. Pentagon acquisition chief Frank Kendall this month said U.S. officials were looking at a joint government-industry development of a U.S. rocket engine and other options to reduce U.S. reliance on Russian-built engines. Despite the concerns, Russia has continued to deliver RD-180 engines to the United States, with two engines arriving last month and three more slated for delivery this fall. ULA says it has enough RD-180 engines on hand to last for two years. It has an $11 billion contract with the U.S. Air Force for 36 launches, but SpaceX, has sued in federal claims court to be allowed to compete for more of that work.   (Reporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Matt Driskill) FREE AppDownload
Germany’s investors are getting more and more bearish about the country’s economic situation, and Europe as a whole. The ZEW index of investor confidence in the Eurozone dropped to 14.2 this morning, and the German reading slumped to 6.9. Both are the lowest since 2012, as growth and inflation in the region drop to almost nothing. The ZEW survey asks investors questions about how strong they think the Eurozone and German economies are now, and how strong they expect them to be in several months' time, gauging their confidence. A good ZEW number is as high as possible — but both these scores are barely above zero. Pantheon Macro Jennifer McKeown of Capital Economics said the survey adds to the pile of evidence “that the German recovery is petering out," according to a note to investors. “The fact that the index is barely positive means that only a small majority of investors see German economic conditions improving in the next six months." The country saw a surprise GDP contraction in the second quarter, with a drop of 0.2%, and the threat of further sanctions on or from Russia is another major factor adding to the grim outlook for Germany and Europe.   FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersA man walk past graffiti in DetroitDETROIT (Reuters) - Detroit on Monday officially settled with one of its fiercest creditors, removing a major hurdle for the city to exit its historic bankruptcy but possibly creating another delay in the trial on restructuring its $18 billion in debt and obligations. The settlement with Syncora Guarantee Inc. – to be included in another version of the plan that will be released late Monday – leaves Financial Guaranty Insurance Co, which has $1.1 billion on the line, as the major holdout creditor. To retool its case, FGIC asked Bankruptcy Judge Steven Rhode to pause the hearing for a week starting on Friday, after having witnesses testify through Thursday. Rhodes appeared likely to approve the request during Monday afternoon discussions. The hearing began on Sept. 2 and is scheduled to stretch into October. If FGIC settles with the city, the trial would be shortened. Still, the city must make the case that its restructuring plan is fair and feasible, requiring it to call numerous witnesses to testify on the soundness of its creditor settlements and financial projections. David Heiman, whose law firm Jones Day represents Detroit, told Rhodes that Syncora and the city "have laid down their swords." In a court filing on Monday, Syncora confirmed a "comprehensive settlement" with the city that was still subject to "definitive documentation and resolution of other terms." Under the deal, Syncora will withdraw all of its objections to Detroit's plan including appeals pending in U.S. District Court and the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, Heiman said. Initially, the Syncora deal had hinged on the insurer settling claims and counterclaims with interest-rate swap providers UBS AG and Bank of America unit Merrill Lynch Capital Services. But James Sprayregen, Syncora's chief attorney at law firm Kirkland &amp; Ellis, told a media conference call that was no longer part of the deal, and the swaps dispute will be resolved outside of the bankruptcy case. Syncora insured some of the city's $1.4 billion of pension debt and related swaps. He added Detroit will continue its litigation to void the pension certificates of participation (COPs). If the city prevails, money it would have used to pay off the debt would flow into a trust for retiree healthcare, limited-tax general obligation bondholders and some miscellaneous claims. Sprayregen said the Syncora settlement would change those deals. “That’s not our issue. That’s for the city to deliver,” he said. On Monday, Rhodes said FGIC should have time to file objections to the upcoming version of the plan that incorporates both the Syncora settlement and an agreement on the water and sewerage department. Meanwhile, the Detroit City Council on Monday unanimously approved an up to $275 million borrowing through Barclays Capital Inc to finance the city's exit from bankruptcy. The settlement with Syncora, which has a $400 million exposure in the case, comes in two parts: a financial resolution to the company's objection to the plan and a development agreement. Under the financial resolution, Syncora will see a 13.9 percent recovery on its pension debt claims, said Corinne Ball, a Jones Day attorney representing the city. That is slightly higher than the 10 percent recovery initially offered. The payments will be covered by two note issues. The first, $25 million, is part of the litigation trust. The second, $21.3 million, will be paid with public parking revenue. Ball emphasized any other creditor who settles with the city over the pension certificates claims will receive the same terms. That would include FGIC. Syncora will also receive $5 million, coming from an account backed by casino revenue. The development part of the deal gives Syncora an extension of its lease on part of the tunnel connecting Detroit to Canada, options to acquire six lots to develop, a $6.25 million credit toward acquiring city assets and control of a major parking garage. (The story corrects reference to FGIC in paragraph 2, clarifies Detroit's attorney.)   (Additional reporting by Karen Pierog in Chicago and Peter Suciu in Detroit; editing by Matthew Lewis, Cynthia Osterman and Stephen Coates) FREE AppDownload
AP A Wal-Mart employee in Walpole, Mass. pushes a line of shopping carts.(Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc's &lt;wmt.n&gt; Chief Spokesman David Tovar resigned after the company allegedly found that he had lied about his academic record in his resume, Bloomberg reported, citing a person familiar with the matter. While conducting a due-diligence screening, Wal-Mart discovered that Tovar had lied about receiving a bachelor of arts degree from the University of Delaware in 1996, the report said. (http://bloom.bg/1m9M58E) An academic-records official from the University of Delaware confirmed to Bloomberg that Tovar never received the diploma. Tovar, who announced his resignation last week, could not be reached by phone and did not respond to an email seeking comment.

Thomson ReutersA man walks in the rain along the financial district of Pudong in downtown ShanghaiBEIJING (Reuters) - China's foreign direct investment inflows in August fell to a low not seen in at least 2-1/2 years, underscoring the challenges to growth facing the world's second-biggest economy. The weak investment data comes as China's economic growth appears to be hitting a soft patch after a bounce in June, with indicators ranging from imports to industrial output and investment all pointing to sluggish activity. China attracted $7.2 billion in foreign direct investment in August, the Commerce Ministry said on Tuesday, down 14 percent from a year earlier and at a level not seen since February 2012. That left China with $78.3 billion of FDI in the first eight months of 2014, down 1.8 percent from a year earlier. FDI is an important gauge of the health of the external economy, to which China's vast factory sector is oriented, but it is a small contributor to overall capital flows compared with exports, which were worth about $2 trillion in 2013. But even China's exports are at risk of slowing from uncertainties in global demand. China's trade ministry spokesman Shen Danyang said on Tuesday exports may not be able to sustain high growth in the months to come although the country's trade situation was stabilizing. FDI inflows in China have maintained steady growth every year since the country joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. Inflows reached a record high of $118 billion in 2013. In the first eight months of the year, China's services sector attracted $43.3 billion of FDI, up 8.9 percent from a year ago and faring much better than the manufacturing industry, where FDI dropped 15.7 percent from a year ago to $27.5 billion. Among the 10 countries that are the biggest sources of China's FDI, investment from South Korea surged 31.3 percent on an annual basis and that from Britain leapt 18.9 percent. In contrast, investment from Japan plunged 43.3 percent from a year earlier while FDI from the United States and European Union dropped between 17-18 percent each. China's non-financial direct outbound investment rose 15.3 percent in the first eight months from a year earlier to $65.2 billion.   (Editing by Jacqueline Wong) FREE AppDownload
FRANKFURT/TOKYO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Attempts by the European Central Bank to weaken the euro have the potential to spark a currency war but policymakers across the world are keeping silent, knowing the ECB has scant alternatives to keep its economy afloat. Euro zone central bankers have spelled out the need for a weaker euro to breathe life into the bloc's economy, which flatlined in the second quarter and is flirting with deflation. Such comments are usually a no-go among the big industrialized nations for fear that one country's bid to become more competitive might trigger a race to devalue currencies and prompt other economies to resort to protectionism. But ECB measures that have helped push down the euro to below $1.30 from just shy of $1.40 in May have drawn little objection. These include verbal interventions, cutting interest rates close to zero and a pledge to flood the banking system with money via cheap loans and purchases of private sector debt. "People aren't criticizing the ECB as triggering a currency war, because they are worried the euro zone may slip into deflation," said a Japanese policymaker with direct knowledge of exchange rate policy. "It's in the interests of the global economy for Europeans to do what's needed to avoid deflation." Japan got a similar pass from its G20 peers last year when Prime Minister Shinzo Abe launched an aggressive mix of monetary and fiscal stimulus that pushed the yen sharply lower. Having urged Tokyo for years to do something to galvanize its listless economy, other major economic powers could hardly complain about such "Abenomics." The problem for the ECB is that its new funding may not pass through to businesses and households as intended. Many euro zone banks are still laden with bad loans and struggling to meet regulatory demands for more capital buffers, while uncertainty from the conflict in Ukraine and a sanctions war with Russia could spoil companies' appetite for new loans. A weaker euro might be a more effective remedy. "With the euro zone doing worse economically than the United States and United Kingdom, a weaker euro against the dollar and pound is just what the doctor ordered," said Barry Eichengreen, professor of economics at the University of California and one of the world's foremost experts on currency systems. "There would then be an end to the litany of financial shocks originating in Europe that have perturbed U.S. financial markets for the last four years." The United States has criticized currency policies in the past - urging China, for example, to move towards a market-determined exchange rate - but its bigger concern now is possible deflation in Europe. "Some recent steps and further discussion in Europe toward a more accommodative pro-growth strategy are encouraging, but boosting domestic demand is key and efforts to do so should be supported by decisive actions across a full range of economic policies – fiscal, structural and monetary," a U.S. Treasury official said on Friday. Although ECB chief Mario Draghi's initial efforts to talk down the euro raised eyebrows in Tokyo, policymakers there have been silent on recent verbal interventions by ECB officials. After nearly two decades of deflation and economic stagnation - and with the yen at a six-year low against the dollar helping Japan's export-reliant economy - they know how important the currency channel can be. When the Bank of Japan launched its massive quantitative easing (QE) program in April last year, a tumbling yen was regarded as a key transmission mechanism, driving up import costs and salaries at exporters. That helped push core consumer inflation to above 1 percent from below zero in a year. "The ECB's stance is similar to what Japan is doing and no one can criticize that," Nomura currency strategist Yujiro Goto said. "If the euro continues to depreciate that might be a bit negative for Japanese inflation momentum, but at this moment people are more focused on dollar/yen, which is appreciating again." Japan's stronger business ties with Asia and the United States mean a weaker euro will affect it only marginally, although BoJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has said he is ready to talk down the yen if the euro fall triggers a yen spike. Some Japanese policymakers see the ECB's explicit language on the euro as a sign of desperation, pointing to its depleted policy arsenal and high threshold for deploying QE. Worried that stagnant euro zone demand will drag on emerging Asian economies, they see merits in allowing Europe to take whatever steps are needed to revive growth, as long as there is no direct intervention in currency markets to weaken the euro. When ECB policymakers talk about the euro, they emphasize that the exchange rate is not a policy target. But the ECB has an inflation target and the exchange rate influences inflation. Draghi said in March, for example, that an effective rise in the euro of about 8 percent since mid-2012 had knocked 40 to 50 basis points off headline inflation, which was then 0.5 percent but slowed to 0.3 percent in August. French central bank governor Christian Noyer said last week the euro's roughly 4 percent fall since meant policymakers' rhetoric had "succeeded perfectly", adding: "We needed to bring the euro down and we still need to bring the euro down." "The significant point here was to affect the exchange rate," his Austrian counterpart Ewald Nowotny said hours after this month's unexpected interest rate cut. The ECB's latest staff projections see import prices rising, helped by a weaker euro, which should feed inflation, but the bank stresses it could do more if deflation risks persist - including broadening asset purchases to include sovereign bonds. The currency may be a trigger for that: "All things being equal, a stronger euro justifies a more accommodating monetary policy," Executive Board member Benoit Coeure said last week. Provided the ECB sticks to domestic assets and does not intervene directly - neither of which are on its agenda at present - its central bank peers are likely to tolerate its actions unless the euro takes a dramatic dive. "Continuing to take steps to actively push down the exchange rate after the euro has fallen by, say, 30 percent would be enough to excite foreign critics," Eichengreen said. "But the euro's fall to date is only 5 percent on a trade-weighted basis. So any red line is far off in the future." (Editing by Catherine Evans) FREE AppDownload
TelegraphBritons, Spaniards, and the French are squeezed for more, but the Germans pay less. Banking should be simple: savings are taken in at one rate and paid out as loans or mortgages at a higher rate. Modern finance convoluted this process, famously leading to the destructive credit crisis. But this gap between mortgage rates and savings rates, shown in the graph above, speaks volumes about the money banks make from you, the customer. Margins were modest before the crisis, as banks borrowed on wholesale markets. When this dried up in 2009 and 2010, the gap was as high as 2.2 percentage points. This was because banks, rocked by the crisis, became reluctant to lend. Yes, savings rates were kept higher than they would otherwise have been – banks were desperate to shore themselves up with savers’ cash – but new mortgages were priced to put off all but the most determined borrowers. The margin began to return to the 2007 level as the intensity of the crisis eased – until the Government’s Funding for Lending Scheme interfered with the market in 2012, and aided the pickpocketing of savers. The Bank of England handed money to lenders at rates as low as 0.25pc on the condition that they lend it out to mortgage borrowers or small firms. With this cheap money available, banks had far less need of savers’ cash and cut savings rates far faster, the data suggests, than they cut mortgage rates. The data, based on European Central Bank figures and compiled by SNL, an information firm, also shows the savings-mortgage gap for other major European countries. Germany, which avoided property boom and bust, has shown predictable stability, albeit with its banks squeezing more out of Germans than other European banks can manage. Spanish banks, in contrast, have been extremely volatile with their pricing and, even though they have ramped up the amount they make from saving and lending, analysts at SNL say that, because of the glut of property in Spain, they will agree loans only for the most creditworthy borrowers. Expats should take note. • andrew.oxlade@telegraph.co.uk For more on savings rates, tax loopholes and investment ideas: sign up to our weekly newsletter by entering your email here.

Thomson ReutersFile photo of General Motors logo outside its headquarters at the Renaissance Center in DetroitBERLIN (Reuters) - General Motors'  Opel division will cut production in Russia and take steps to shrink its workforce as the carmaker reorganises business in the country due to falling demand. Opel said on Tuesday it would scale back operations at its plant in Saint Petersburg to a total of 16 days during the three-month period August to October. "Russia was our third-biggest market last year after the UK and Germany," Chief Executive Karl-Thomas Neumann said in a statement. "At the moment, this market is locked into severe turbulences." Auto sales have faltered in Russia this year as slowing economic growth is causing people to put off purchases. Western sanctions over the crisis in Ukraine and the devaluing rouble are causing further strains to carmakers. Opel said it would move to one-shift operations, speed up localisation of suppliers and offer voluntary severance packages to about a quarter of the plant's 2,000 staff. The carmaker said it aimed to purchase 60 percent of all parts locally to alleviate cost pressures in St Petersburg. Restructuring measures will also involve changes in senior personnel. Susanna Webber, head of purchasing and logistics, will take the helm of Opel's Russian operations with immediate effect, to be assisted by new vice president Andy Dunstan, who previously was the carmaker's managing director in the country. Still, Opel's planned investments in parent GM's joint venture with Russia's top carmaker Avtovaz  will not be impaired by the changes, Neumann said. "We are monitoring market developments very closely and adjust our expansion plans," the CEO said. "We believe in the long-term potential of Russia but volume and prices are under strong pressure and the rouble keeps devaluing. We're now taking steps to minimize the risk and stay on course."

REUTERS/Sang TanBank of England Governor Mark Carney speaks to the audience after his public speech on "One Mission. One Bank. Promoting the good of the people of the United Kingdom" at the Cass Business School in London March 18, 2014. High household debt levels could be one of the main reasons the 2008 financial crash became the longest and deepest recession since the 19th century, according to a report by the Bank of England. The report provides strong evidence that consumers with high debts panicked in the wake of the crash, fearing the effects of recession on their personal finances. If this group cut their spending by more than the average, it could account for two-fifths of the 5% collapse in private consumption after 2007, the report says. The findings support a clampdown by regulators on high loan to income mortgages, which became more widespread following a steep rise in house prices, especially in London and the south-east. Officials at the Bank believe maintaining low rates of private debt relative to national income will help protect the UK from severe recession in the event of another financial crash. Britain's household debt soared higher than 160% of GDP in 2007, from 100% in 2000. It has since fallen below 140% before starting to climb again. The Office for Budget Responsibility has estimated that by 2016-17 it will have reached its previous peak and will continue to rise.

Thomson ReutersThe logo of Russia's top crude producer Rosneft is seen in MoscowBy Darya Korsunskaya MOSCOW (Reuters) - Sanctions-hit oil company Rosneft  will be able to apply for money from a state wealth fund, Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich said on Tuesday, adding that the government had "on the whole" approved the company's investment program. Rosneft's access to Western money has been restricted by the sanctions imposed in response to Moscow's role in the Ukrainian conflict. Rosneft has asked the government for $42 billion support from a fund earmarked for Russian pensions to help it weather the sanctions. Dvorkovich said that Rosneft had yet to apply formally for help from the National Wealth Fund and that it must define the projects for which it needs money from the fund. "Everyone has the right to apply to the Economy Ministry and to define its projects (for help from the fund). Rosneft has not applied to us about such projects. There have been only general proposals," he said. "We will look at (Rosneft's request) seriously," he said. Last year, Rosneft's Chief Executive Igor Sechin said Rosneft needed $0.5 trillion to develop Russian Arctic fields. Analysts from Merrill Lynch said the Arctic program had long been seen as one of the bright spots of Russia's future economic development. Dvorkovich declined to reveal the details of Rosneft's investment program, which stood at around 600 billion roubles ($15.5 billion) in 2013 and which had been expected to rise to 730 billion roubles for 2014. "Rosneft's investment program was discussed during prime minister's meeting. On the whole, it was approved. There are some nuances on timing of the program," Dvorkovich said.

Thomson ReutersFile photo of people looking at OXBO harvesters at the 47th Annual World Ag Expo in Tulare, CaliforniaBy James B. Kelleher CHICAGO (Reuters) - Farm equipment makers insist the sales slump they face this year because of lower crop prices and farm incomes will be short-lived. Yet there are signs the downturn may last longer than tractor and harvester makers, including Deere &amp; Co , are letting on and the pain could persist long after corn, soybean and wheat prices rebound. Farmers and analysts say the elimination of government incentives to buy new equipment, a related overhang of used tractors, and a reduced commitment to biofuels, all darken the outlook for the sector beyond 2019 - the year the U.S. Department of Agriculture says farm incomes will begin to rise again. Company executives are not so pessimistic. "Yes commodity prices and farm income are lower but they’re still at historically high levels," says Martin Richenhagen, the president and chief executive of Duluth, Georgia-based Agco Corp , which makes Massey Ferguson and Challenger brand tractors and harvesters. Farmers like Pat Solon, who grows corn and soybeans on a 1,500-acre Illinois farm, however, sound far less upbeat. Solon says corn would need to rise to at least $4.25 a bushel from below $3.50 now for growers to feel confident enough to start buying new equipment again. As recently as 2012, corn fetched $8 a bushel. Such a bounce appears even less likely since Thursday, when  the U.S. Department of Agriculture cut its price estimates for the current corn crop to $3.20-$3.80 a bushel from earlier $3.55-$4.25. The revision prompted Larry De Maria, an analyst at William Blair, to warn "a perfect storm for a severe farm recession" may be brewing.  SHOPPING SPREE The impact of bin-busting harvests - driving down prices and farm incomes around the globe and depressing machinery makers' worldwide sales - is aggravated by other problems. Farmers bought far more equipment than they needed during the last upturn, which began in 2007 when the U.S. government -- jumping on the global biofuel bandwagon -- ordered energy firms to blend increasing amounts of corn-based ethanol with gasoline. Grain and oilseed prices surged and farm income more than doubled to $131 billion last year from $57.4 billion in 2006, according to USDA. Flush with cash, farmers went shopping. “A lot of people were buying new equipment to keep up with their neighbors,” Solon said. “It was a matter of want, not need." Adding to the frenzy, U.S. incentives allowed growers buying new equipment to shave as much as $500,000 off their taxable income through bonus depreciation and other credits. "For the last few years, financial advisers have been telling farmers, ‘You can buy a piece of equipment, use it for a year, sell it back and get all your money out,” says Eli Lustgarten at Longbow Research. While it lasted, the distorted demand brought fat profits for equipment makers. Between 2006 and 2013, Deere’s net income more than doubled to $3.5 billion. But with grain prices down, the tax incentives gone, and the future of ethanol mandate in doubt, demand has tanked and dealers are stuck with unsold used tractors and harvesters. Their shares under pressure, the equipment makers have started to react. In August, Deere said it was laying off more than 1,000 workers and temporarily idling several plants. Its rivals, including CNH Industrial NV  and Agco, are expected to follow suit. Investors trying to understand how deep the downturn could be may consider lessons from another industry tied to global commodity prices: mining equipment manufacturing. Companies like Caterpillar Inc.  saw a big jump in sales a few years back when China-led demand sent the price of industrial commodities soaring. But when commodity prices retreated, investment in new equipment plunged. Even today -- with mine production recovering along with copper and iron ore prices -- Caterpillar says sales to the industry continue to tumble as miners "sweat" the machines they already own. The lesson, De Maria says, is that farm machinery sales could suffer for years - even if grain prices rebound because of bad weather or other changes in supply. Some argue, however, the pessimists are wrong. "Yes, the next few years are going to be ugly," says Michael Kon, a senior equities analyst at the Golub Group, a California investment firm that recently took a stake in Deere. "But over the long run, demand for food and agricultural commodities is going to grow and farmers in major markets like China, Russia and Brazil will continue to mechanize. Machinery manufacturers will benefit from both those trends." In the meantime, though, growers continue to flock to showrooms lured by what Mark Nelson, who grows corn, soybeans and wheat on 2,000 acres in Kansas, characterizes as "shocking" bargains on used equipment. Earlier this month, Nelson traded in his Deere combine with 1,000 hours on it for one with just 400 hours on it. The difference in price between the two machines was just over $100,000 - and the dealer offered to lend Nelson that sum interest-free through 2017. "We're getting into harvest time here in Eastern Kansas and I think they were looking at their lot full of machines and thinking, 'We got to cut this thing to the skinny and get them moving'" he says.

Flag Institute Last November, the Flag Institute, which manages the United Kingdom's national Flag Registry, conducted a survey on the future of the Union flag if Scotland becomes independent.  The national flag of the United Kingdom, better known as the Union Jack, combines the crosses of England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland.  In the survey, respondents were asked questions like: "If Scotland becomes independent, do you think the Union flag will or will not change?" (56% said it will change) and "If Scotland becomes independent, do you think the Union flag should or should not change?" (64.8% said it should change.) Along with the survey responses, loads of people also sent in their suggestions for what the new British flag might look like if Scotland cuts ties with the U.K. in the upcoming Sept. 18 vote.  "It should be noted that the Flag Institute is not recommending any of these designs," Flag Institute chief executive Charles Ashburner said in a statement. "However as the UK's national flag charity the role of the Flag Institute is to facilitate and inform any national debate about its flag — nothing more complicated than that." Some of the suggested designs appear below. Have a favorite? Let us know in the comments. This is one of the most popular of the suggested designs, according to Ashburner. Basically, it just removes the blue Scottish bits and replaces it with the black of Wales' cross. Flag InstituteThis one includes black as well as gold from the Wales' St. David flag. Flag Institute This flag has a similar theme.  Flag Institute This flag removes the Scotland part and replaces it with elements of the Welsh Dragon flag.  Flag Institute The Welsh-oriented suggestions are less popular, says Ashburner.  Flag Institute A dizzying cross-based design submitted by John Yates and titled as "United Britain" really stands out from other flags already out there.  Flag Institute A lot of designs just stitch the flags of the remaining home nations together.  Flag Institute Flag Institute The two flags below are rather intricate.

Thomson ReutersPassengers walk at the airstrip as they arrive at Charallave airport outside CaracasBy Girish Gupta CARACAS (Reuters) - Buses across jungle borders, boats through Caribbean waters and private flights from small airfields have become a new norm for departing Venezuela as a multi-billion dollar pay dispute turns the country into something of a 'no-fly' zone. Major international airlines have slashed seat availability by half since last year, pulling many routes entirely in a spat  with Venezuela's socialist government about the repatriation of $3.6 billion in ticket revenue. The dwindling supply has sent prices spiraling for available seats, and led to a surge of more inventive travel itineraries via circuitous routes and other means. "I've never flown private but I had to because you just can't get a normal flight," said Orinda Pamfil, 23, at the small, exclusive Charallave airport in hills outside Caracas. Unable to find a commercial ticket to the United States, she was lucky to be traveling to Houston in a spare seat on a small plane owned by a friend of a friend. "It's impossible for normal Venezuelans to travel," she said, clutching designer luggage. Hiring a seven-seat private plane, such as a Learjet 55, costs upwards of $2,500 per hour, said private pilot Carlos da Silva. Used to flying super-wealthy clients, he is now receiving calls from groups of middle-class Venezuelans looking to share costs. "There's been a surge in demand because people are desperate," added another pilot Nicolas Veloz who estimated demand was up at least 20 percent in recent months. "They have business, school, health issues abroad. Sometimes people just have to get out in an emergency." Venezuelans unable to afford private planes or find a rare seat on a commercial flight are taking more laborious trips across land and sea. On a recent morning at Caracas' tiny Rutas de America bus terminal, 39-year-old Yane Gonzalez was about to take a four-day trip across the Andes via Colombia to the Peruvian capital Lima thousands of kilometers away. "Of course I'd rather fly!" said Gonzalez, who was giving up her work selling snacks at a kiosk in Caracas to begin a new life in Peru. "But we go to the airline and they have no seats."  CURRENCY COMPLICATIONS The airline problem, the latest manifestation of multiple strains across the Venezuelan economy, derives from a government requirement that domestic ticket sales be in local currency. Some 24 airlines have built up the equivalent of $3.6 billion in bolivars but are unable to convert that money into hard currency, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). This is due to delays in authorizations from the government which, for over a decade, has operated strict foreign exchange controls. "The country unfortunately is disconnecting from the world economy and runs the risk of deeper isolation," said Jason Sinclair, an IATA spokesman. "It simply is not sustainable for the airlines to fly to a country where they cannot be paid." Negotiations are underway and around a third of the airlines have reached agreements in principle but the terms are incomplete and "lack any form of guarantees", Sinclair said. International airlines have cut seat availability in and out of Venezuela by 49 per cent on last year, IATA said. Major airlines including Air Canada  and Alitalia earlier this year suspended all flights, citing safety concerns and difficulty in repatriating revenue. Alitalia began flying again earlier this month, though with a limited service. A plethora of others, including American Airlines , Delta Airlines  and United Airlines , slashed most but not all flights earlier this year. European airlines including Lufthansa  and Iberia have also cut routes.  CAPITALIST 'WAR' Caracas was American Airlines' first destination in South America more than a quarter-century ago but the carrier cut almost 80 percent of its weekly flights to Venezuela in June. The airline said it is owed $791 million. It still runs 10 weekly flights to Venezuela from Miami, though these can now only be paid for abroad in hard currency. A Miami to Caracas return on American Airlines - a six-hour flight - for next month is listed at $2,000. A comparable flight from Miami to Bogota, in neighboring Colombia, is around $750. Though his ministers are in discussions with the airlines, President Nicolas Maduro has cast the problem as part of an "economic war" against him by capitalist foes and has threatened airlines that pull out with permanent expulsion. "Whoever leaves Venezuela in the midst of this economic war doesn't return ... because Venezuela must be respected," said Maduro. He has kept the socialist policies and currency controls of his predecessor Hugo Chavez, who died of cancer last year, but he faces a plethora of problems from shortages of goods to high inflation and an economy that analysts say is in recession. Venezuela's domestic carriers are also struggling because they find it hard to obtain dollars to import parts for maintenance. This has led to a severe shortage of flights, adding to angst for travelers. "There are aircraft just sitting on the tarmac (at public airports) because they don't have parts," pilot Veloz added. Some travelers are finding friends or companies with boats to take them to the nearby Caribbean islands such as Aruba, Curacao and Trinidad where onward flight availability to popular destinations like New York or Miami is much easier. One travel agent struggling to find a customer flights to the nearby tourist islands of Los Roques suggested hiring a private catamaran instead. Many travel agents are struggling to make a living. They protested earlier this year outside the tourism ministry and some have given up their work. Others are up for the challenge. "If you're young, rich and agile, you'll find a way to get out," said travel agent Doris Gaal. "But it's not going to be easy."  (Editing by Andrew Cawthorne and Kieran Murray) FREE AppDownload
