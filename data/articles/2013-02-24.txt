yewenyi / FlickrChina's Flash Manufacturing PMI fell to a four-month low of 50.4 in February from 52.3 in January. Economists were looking for a reading of 52.2. Despite this unexpectedly low reading, markets are taking the report in stride.  Chinese stocks are trading up. "We suggest not taking this flash PMI seriously as this PMI data point was heavily distorted by the Chinese New Year holiday," writes Bank of America Merrill Lynch economist Ting Lu. While PMI is often regarded as one of the best economic indicators available, Lu believes it is "not a good barometer."  At least this time around.  From his latest note: Why PMI is not a good barometerNeither the NBS nor the HSBC could do a good job in creating PMI during the Chinese New Year holiday. First, there could be a large amount of missing values for already small sample sizes (HSBC at around 500, NBS at 3000) due to the holiday. This is especially true for the HSBC February flash PMI this year as the holiday was from 9 to 15 Feb and the private sector’s holiday could last until end-Feb. Second, PMI data are heavily seasonally adjusted, but the season adjustment is quite inaccurate due to the different timing of CNY holidays and short history (since year 2005). In other words, Lu believes this may turn out to be a blip in a string of upward trending data.  Let's hope he's right and that this isn't an inflection point to the downside.

This is down from the final January reading of 52.3.Â  A reading below 50 indicates contraction. The decline in new export orders shows that weakness in the U.S. and Europe are still weighing on Chinese manufacturing.

APLess than a week before across-the-board cuts start to kick in as a result of the sequester, the White House warned on Sunday of the state-by-state effect of the cuts.Â  The White House released reports outlining how the cuts would affect each of the nation's 50 states, as well as the District of Columbia.Â  Jason Furman,Â Deputy Director of the Obama administration'sÂ National Economic Council, gave some examples of the looming cuts on an afternoon White House conference call: The White House may be trying to use weekend warnings from state governors â€” such as Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell and Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, who are both Republicans â€” to hammer its point.  On CBS' Face the Nation Sunday, McDonnell said that sequesterÂ was "put in place to be a hammer, not a policy." Brewer, also a Republican, urged Republicans in Congress to be "pragmatic" on compromise â€” including possibly new forms of revenue. White House senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer was asked on the call if he thought Obama had "misjudged" how badly Republicans would end up wanting to avert the sequester. Pfeiffer rejected that, saying the GOP has only changed its stance lately because they want to appear to have "leverage" on the issue. "Republicans racked up a lot of frequent flyer miles heading to Virginia during the election to campaign about how horrible these cuts would be to our defense and to try to score political points against the President," Pfeiffer said.Â  Pfeiffer blamed the Republican leadership for muting some conservative voices he pointed out were warning about the mistake of the sequester's implementation. "Few people have more credibility in these issues in the Republican Party than Sen. McCain, and he has been very vocal about what a terrible idea this is," Pfeiffer said of the Arizona Republican. "Many in the Republican establishment, like Bill Kristol, have talked about what a terrible mistake the Republicans are making. If the leadership would get out of the way, there are a lot of Republicans who would be open to a more balanced, compromised approach to this." House Speaker John Boehner's office responded to the White House's call with a familiar line â€” that House Republicans have twice passed legislation to replace the sequester's cuts with other targeted cuts. However, that legislation expired with the end of the last Congress. "Republicans in the House have voted â€” twice â€” to replace President Obama's sequester with smarter spending cuts," Boehner spokesman Michael Steele said. "The White House needs to spend less time explaining to the press how bad the sequester will be and more time actually working to stop it."
Markets are open in Asia and they're up. Japan's Nikkei is up 1.8 percent. Australia's S&amp;P/ ASX is up 0.8 percent. Korea's Kospi is up 0.1 percent. For months Japan's markets have been moving on expectations for aggressive easy monetary policy.  The yen has been going down, and Japanese stocks have been going up. But just when you thought those efforts were priced in, the latest news out of Japan is pressuring the yen again today.  His name is Haruhiki Kuroda, the man expected to be the next governor of the Bank of Japan.  Kuroda is known for being particularly dovish, and the markets appear to believe that he will be able to execute Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's plans to stimulate the economy. Here's a look at the huge moves in the Nikkei and the Yen via Nikkei.com: Nikkei.com
The SEC summoned the unidentified traders that executed suspicious trades on Heinz stock earlier this month to a New York City Court on Friday. The problem is, the unknown traders didn't show. On February 14th, Warren Buffett announced that he and Brazilian billionaire Jorge Lemann would buy Heinz for $23 billion. The day before, there was a surge in the purchase of options to buy Heinz stock — and they all seemed to come from the same place. That place was a Swiss Goldman Sachs account and, according to Bloomberg, Judge Jed Rakoff, infamous for his tough stance on Wall Street crime, has ordered that the account be frozen. From Bloomberg: “They can hide, but their assets can’t run,” Rakoff announced, saying he had granted the SEC’s request and signed the freeze order... “It appears that the defendants known as ’Certain Unknown Traders in the Securities of H.J. Heinz Co. (HNZ)’ have chosen to remain unknown, at least in terms of any appearance today in court,” Rakoff said. “The matter is called. It’s now 2:22 and no one has appeared.”... “So, there appears to be no opposition to the proposed order that would freeze on a more permanent basis pending further proceedings of the amount in question and also prohibits the destruction of records,” Rakoff said. “I find that the relief was very well warranted and so I have signed the propose order.”  After the Heinz deal was announced, the company's stock surged from $60.48 to $72.50. The traders had purchased the option to buy Heinz stock at $65, and had invested $90,000 into the trade. Goldman Sachs has said it is cooperating with authorities, but that it does not have "direct access" to the owner behind the transactions in the account.

Wikimedia Commons The week begins, and we have our first two big losers. Both the pound (here) and the yen (here) are gapping lower in early currency trading. What's going on? In the U.K., this is a reaction to the downgrade. And in Japan, this is a result of the fact that the next Bank of Japan governor is likely to be Haruhiko Kuroda, the head of the Asian Development Bank. He is described by Reuters as an advocate of aggressive monetary easing. So Japan will keep up the monetary gas-pump, and the pound continues to take its shellacking due to debt, a weak economy, and expectations of more easing. These are the two most-hated currencies in the world right now, and today is a classic example of why.
Joseph Weisenthal, Business InsiderReminder: The first exit polls from the Italian election will hit some time around 9 AM ET on Monday, before US markets officially open. The hope for World markets/the EU/Italian elites is that the center-left parties get enough votes to form a stable majority. The fear is that there will be a big surge for the conservative (Berlusconi) and populist (Beppe Grillo) movements, making a government untenable, and thus risking a backsliding of Italy's reforms, causing borrowing costs to jump, and thus reigniting the European crisis. Italy is Europe's largest debt market, and the third largest in the world. According to Goldman, it could go either way: On what is seen as the most likely result – a centre-left coalition government – the 10-yr yield spread to Germany could narrow by 50-75bp from current levels. But an outcome deemed almost as probable – a ‘hung parliament’ – could lead to market volatility while an agreement among parliamentary groups is sought. From a strategy standpoint, we reiterate our constructive stance on the direction of EMU spreads, but maintain a preference for Spain over Italy. If the parliament is hung, says Goldman: An outcome seen as almost as probable, however, is one of no clear majority resulting from the vote. In case of a relatively strong showing by either Mr. Berlusconi or Mr. Grillo’s movement, the coalitions headed by Mr. Bersani and Mr. Monti would not get enough seats to control the Upper House and form a government.  In such scenario we foresee two alternatives:      Markets would be very nervous until an agreement is hammered out. Consequently, we would expect a sharp increase in volatility during this period, with spreads widening in a two-way flows market. As it becomes clearer that a new government would be formed, BTPs could stabilize around current levels – i.e., wider than implied by macro factors especially at longer maturities. From a markets perspective, this outcome would magnify volatility, and BTPs would come under considerable pressure. Bond spreads as wide as those seen in November 2011 (550bp over Germany in the 10-yr area) are not unreasonable as a working hypothesis. Under this scenario a caretaker government could ask the Eurogroup and the ECB for help under the OMT framework. Goldman also leaves the door open to a possible victory outright by Silvio Berlusconi, which would potentially be very unwelcome news. One note so far: Turnout is down from the last election in 2008. This is a bit of a surprise, and it could be ominous for the cause of stability. It could mean that the mainstream center-left parties (which seem to inspire very little passion in anyone) are seeing their supporters stay home, while the protest parties (especially Beppe Grillo's 5-star movement) are surging. That's just one possibility. The weather is also bad in a lot of the country. Some older voters might just be sitting it out. We'll know more in a few hours.
Rome, Italy â€” There's a faction of US travelers who dream of having a train system more like what they have in Europe. So today, when I took a train from Milan to Rome, to cover the end of the election, I figured I'd pay attention to what actually makes trains in Italy better. The train I rode looked like this. Joe Weisenthal, Business Insider Anyway, it was a better experience than riding Amtrak. And that came down to two things. Actually, it's not free. It costs literally one euro cent. Apparently that's just so they can get your personal data. Joe Weisenthal, Business Insider Â  If you follow any East Coast media elites on Twitter, you've certainly seen them whine about the crappy WiFi on Amtrak trains. Anyway, this WiFi just worked, except when the train was going through a tunnel through a mountain, but that's an understandable flaw. 3 or 4 times on the 3 hour trip, an espresso cart came through the aisle, making fresh-poured espresso in little plastic, clinical cups. Joe Weisenthal, Business Insider Â  There were also some other snacks on the cart, but the espresso was the highlight. So it's simple, Amtrak, you could make your service infinitely better by having blazing fast WiFi, and jet-fuel strength espresso carts going up the aisle. Is that too much to ask?
British AirwaysA British Airways 747-400 In 1982, a British Airways 747 flew into a cloud of volcanic ash near Indonesia. One by one, all four of its engines failed. After falling more than 25,000 feet and preparing to ditch in the Indian Ocean, the plane's crew eventually got the engines restarted. So the story had a happy ending. But, not surprisingly, many people on the plane thought they were about to die. I am old enough to remember this incident, but I had forgotten something important about it: What the plane's captain said to the passengers the moment after the engines failed. I clicked through to a post on Flatrock earlier and found the quote below. Captain Eric Moody was later praised for a cabin announcement that was described as "a masterpiece of understatement." Moody's announcement was actually more than that. It was a masterpiece, period. If an exceptional speechwriter had spent a week composing the message, he or she couldn't have done better. In 37 short, direct, and simple words, Captain Moody conveyed the following: BACaptain Eric MoodyHere's what Moody said: "Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. We have a small problem. All four engines have stopped. We are doing our damnedest to get them going again. I trust you are not in too much distress." And here's Wikipedia's description of the incident: British Airways Flight 9, sometimes referred to by its callsign Speedbird 9 or Jakarta incident,[1] was a scheduled British Airways flight from London Heathrow to Auckland, with stops in Bombay, Madras, Kuala Lumpur, Perth, and Melbourne. On 24 June 1982, the route was flown by the City of Edinburgh, a 747-236B. The aircraft flew into a cloud of volcanic ash thrown up by the eruption of Mount Galunggung (approximately 180 kilometres (110Â mi) south-east of Jakarta, Indonesia), resulting in the failure of all four engines. The reason for the failure was not immediately apparent to the crew or ground control. The aircraft was diverted to Jakarta in the hope that enough engines could be restarted to allow it to land there. The aircraft was able to glide far enough to exit the ash cloud, and all engines were restarted (although one failed again soon after), allowing the aircraft to land safely at the Halim Perdanakusuma Airport in Jakarta. The crew members of the incident segment had boarded the aircraft in Kuala Lumpur, while many of the passengers had been aboard since the flight began in London.[2] Shortly after 13:40 UTC (20:40 Jakarta time) above the Indian Ocean, south of Java, the flight crew (consisting of Senior First Officer Roger Greaves and Senior Engineer Officer Barry Townley-Freeman while Captain Eric Moody was in the lavatory) first noted an effect on the windscreen similar to St Elmo's fire.[1] The phenomenon persisted after Moody returned from the lavatory. Despite the weather radar showing clear skies, the crew switched on engine anti-ice and the passenger seat belt signs as a precaution. As the flight progressed, smoke began to accumulate in the passenger cabin of the aircraft; it was first assumed to be cigarette smoke. However, it soon began to grow thicker and had an ominous odour of sulphur. Passengers who had a view out the aircraft windows noted that the engines were unusually bright, with light shining forward through the fan blades and producing a stroboscopic effect.[3] At approximately 13:42 UTC (20:42 Jakarta time), engine number four began surging and soon flamed out. The flight crew immediately performed the engine shutdown drill, quickly cutting off fuel supply and arming the fire extinguishers. Less than a minute later, at 13:43 UTC (20:43 Jakarta time), engine two surged and flamed out. Within seconds, and almost simultaneously, engines one and three flamed out, prompting the flight engineer to exclaim, "I don't believe itâ€”all four engines have failed!"[3] Without engine thrust, a 747-200 has a glide ratio of approximately 15:1, meaning it can glide forward 15 kilometres for every kilometre it drops. The flight crew quickly determined that the aircraft was capable of gliding for 23 minutes and covering 91 nautical miles (169Â km) from its flight level of 37,000 feet (11,000Â m).[3] At 13:44 UTC (20:44 Jakarta time), Greaves declared an emergency to the local air traffic control authority, stating that all four engines had failed. However, Jakarta Area Control misunderstood the message, interpreting the call as meaning that only engine number four had shut down. It was only after a nearby Garuda Indonesia flight relayed the message to Air Traffic Control that it was correctly understood. Despite the crew "squawking" the emergency transponder setting of 7700, the aeroplane could not be located by Air Traffic Control on their radar screens. Many passengers, fearing for their lives, wrote notes to relatives. One such passenger was Charles Capewell, who scrawled "Ma. In trouble. Plane going down. Will do best for boys. We love you. Sorry. Pa XXX" on the cover of his ticket wallet.[2] Owing to the high Indonesian mountains on the south coast of the island of Java, an altitude of at least 11,500 feet (3,500Â m) was required to cross the coast safely. The crew decided that if the aircraft was unable to maintain altitude by the time they reached 12,000 feet (3,700Â m) they would turn back out to sea and attempt to ditch into the Indian Ocean. The crew began engine restart drills, despite being well above the recommended maximum engine in-flight start envelope altitude of 28,000 feet (8,500Â m). The restart attempts failed. Despite the lack of time, Moody made an announcement to the passengers that has been described as "a masterpiece of understatement":[3] As pressure within the cabin fell, oxygen masks dropped from the ceiling â€” an automatic emergency measure to make up for the lack of air. On the flight deck, however, Greaves's mask was broken; the delivery tube had detached from the rest of the mask. Moody swiftly decided to descend at 1,800Â m per minute to an altitude where there was enough pressure in the outside atmosphere to breathe almost normally. At 13,500 feet (4,100Â m), the crew was approaching the altitude at which they would have to turn over the ocean and attempt a risky ditching. Although there were guidelines for the water landing procedure, no one had ever tried it in a Boeing 747, nor has anyone since. As they performed the engine restart procedure, engine number four finally started, and at 13:56 UTC (20:56 Jakarta time), Moody used its power to reduce the rate of descent. Shortly thereafter, engine three restarted, allowing him to climb slowly. Shortly after that, engines one and two successfully restarted as well.[6] The crew subsequently requested and expedited an increase in altitude in order to clear the high mountains of Indonesia.[7] As the aircraft approached its target altitude, the St Elmo's fire effect on the windscreen returned. Moody throttled back; however, engine number two surged again and was shut down. The crew immediately descended and held 12,000 feet (3,700Â m). As Flight 9 approached Jakarta, the crew found it difficult to see anything through the windscreen, and made the approach almost entirely on instruments, despite reports of good visibility. The crew decided to fly the ILS (Instrument Landing System); however, the glide slope (vertical guidance) system was inoperative, so they were forced to fly with only the localizer (lateral guidance) as the first officer monitored the airport's DME (Distance Measuring Equipment). He then called out how high they should be at each DME step along the final approach to the runway, creating a virtual glide slope for them to follow. It was, in Moody's words, "a bit like negotiating one's way up a badger's arse."[1] Although the runway lights could be made out through a small strip of the windscreen, the landing lights on the aircraft seemed to be inoperable. After landing, the flight crew found it impossible to taxi, due to glare from apron floodlights which made the already sandblasted windscreen opaque. Post-flight investigation revealed that City of Edinburgh's problems had been caused by flying through a cloud of volcanic ash from the eruption of Mount Galunggung. Because the ash cloud was dry, it did not appear on the weather radar, which was designed to detect the moisture in clouds. The cloud sandblasted the windscreen and landing light covers and clogged the engines. As the ash entered the engines, it melted in the combustion chambers and adhered to the inside of the power-plant. As the engine cooled from inactivity, and as the aircraft descended out of the ash cloud, the molten ash solidified and enough broke off for air to again flow smoothly through the engine, allowing a successful restart. The engines had enough electrical power to restart because one generator and the onboard batteries were still operating; electrical power was required for ignition of the engines. Engines one, two and three were replaced at Jakarta, as well as the windscreen, and the fuel tanks were cleared of the ash that had entered them through the pressurisation ducts, contaminating the fuel and requiring that it be disposed of. After being ferried back to London, engine number four was replaced and major work was undertaken to return the aircraft to service. Although the airspace around Mount Galunggung was closed temporarily after the incident, it was reopened days later. It was only after a Singapore Airlines 747 was forced to shut down three of its engines while flying through the same area nineteen days later (13 July) that Indonesian authorities closed the airspace permanently and rerouted airways to avoid the area; a watch was set up to monitor clouds of ash.[3] Flight 9 was not the first encounter with this eruption â€” a Garuda DC-9 had encountered ash on 5 April 1982.[8] The crew received various awards, including the Queen's Commendation for Valuable Service in the Air and medals from the British Air Line Pilots Association. Following the incident, the crew and passengers formed the Galunggung Gliding Club as a means to keep in contact.[9] G-BDXH's engineless flight entered the Guinness Book of Records as the longest glide in a non-purpose-built aircraft. One of the passengers, Betty Tootell, wrote a book about the incident, All Four Engines Have Failed. She managed to trace some 200 of the 247 passengers on the flight, and went on to marry a fellow survivor, James Ferguson, who had been seated in the row in front of her. She notes: "The 28th December 2006 marks the start of our 14th year of honeymoon, and on the 24th June 2007 many passengers and crew will no doubt gather to celebrate the 25th anniversary of our mid-air adventure."[10] British Airways continued to operate the Flight 9 route from London Heathrow to Sydney; in March 2012 the route was curtailed to Bangkok. City of Edinburgh, later renamed City of Elgin, continued to fly for British Airways after the incident, before being sold to European Aviation Air Charter. The aircraft was taken out of service in February 2004; in 2009, the then 30-year-old aircraft was scrapped. In September 2009 the environmental group 10:10 bought the fuselage of City Of Edinburgh to be made into tags. The tags, bearing the campaign's logo, were worn as necklaces or bracelets and used to raise awareness of 10:10's work: the organisation aimed to persuade individuals, organizations and businesses to reduce their carbon emissions by 10% in 2010.[11] The incident featured in an episode of the Mayday documentary TV series Air Crash Investigation titled "Falling From the Sky". This episode was repeated a number of times when the EyjafjallajÃ¶kull volcano caused a large-scale shutdown of European airspace. Captain Eric Moody gave an interview to the July 2010 edition of Flaps Podcast, where he recounted his experience. A nearly identical incident occurred on 15 December 1989 when KLM Flight 867, a Boeing 747-400 from Amsterdam to Anchorage, Alaska, flew into the plume of the erupting Mount Redoubt, causing all four engines to fail due to compressor stall. Once the flight cleared the ash cloud, the crew was able to restart each engine and then make a safe landing at Anchorage.[12]

Following the incident, the crew and passengers formed the Galunggung Gliding Club as a means to keep in contact.[9] G-BDXH's engineless flight entered the Guinness Book of Records as the longest glide in a non-purpose-built aircraft. One of the passengers, Betty Tootell, wrote a book about the incident, All Four Engines Have Failed. She managed to trace some 200 of the 247 passengers on the flight, and went on to marry a fellow survivor, James Ferguson, who had been seated in the row in front of her. She notes: "The 28th December 2006 marks the start of our 14th year of honeymoon, and on the 24th June 2007 many passengers and crew will no doubt gather to celebrate the 25th anniversary of our mid-air adventure."[10] British Airways continued to operate the Flight 9 route from London Heathrow to Sydney; in March 2012 the route was curtailed to Bangkok. City of Edinburgh, later renamed City of Elgin, continued to fly for British Airways after the incident, before being sold to European Aviation Air Charter. The aircraft was taken out of service in February 2004; in 2009, the then 30-year-old aircraft was scrapped. In September 2009 the environmental group 10:10 bought the fuselage of City Of Edinburgh to be made into tags. The tags, bearing the campaign's logo, were worn as necklaces or bracelets and used to raise awareness of 10:10's work: the organisation aimed to persuade individuals, organizations and businesses to reduce their carbon emissions by 10% in 2010.[11] The incident featured in an episode of the Mayday documentary TV series Air Crash Investigation titled "Falling From the Sky". This episode was repeated a number of times when the EyjafjallajÃ¶kull volcano caused a large-scale shutdown of European airspace. Captain Eric Moody gave an interview to the July 2010 edition of Flaps Podcast, where he recounted his experience. A nearly identical incident occurred on 15 December 1989 when KLM Flight 867, a Boeing 747-400 from Amsterdam to Anchorage, Alaska, flew into the plume of the erupting Mount Redoubt, causing all four engines to fail due to compressor stall. Once the flight cleared the ash cloud, the crew was able to restart each engine and then make a safe landing at Anchorage.[12]
flickr / Mark TurnauckasGood perspective here from SocGen's currency analyst Sebastien Galy. Between the Italian election uncertainty and the UK downgrade, it's safe to expect another dollar pop: The combination of a UK downgrade and a uncertain Italian elections are the fuel for a run of stop losses on long GBPUSD and EURUSD at the opening of the markets in Asia. CFTC positioning had already shown another large scale profit taking on USD shortsÂ  and we are likely in the process of neutralizing these positions in favour of JPY shorts (see report for those that asked to be on the cftc mailing list). It is the stuff of a strange golden age of fx, under invested, over achieving for no great reason, a telltale of a greater instability in the global economy. As for the Italian election results, first exit polling should be coming in prior to the open of the NY market on Monday.
Instagram/lizheinleinI've always considered myself entrepreneurial at heart. Even since I've started my work in IB (investment banking), I have continued to work on developing a few "back pocket" ideas that I'm excited about. Indeed, ever since I can remember, I have wanted to start my own business, not because I hope to be the next Zuckerberg, but because I believe the ability to dictate your own work is more rewarding than any other employment experience out there. It remains my ultimate career goal, and with any luck, I will make it happen some day. That said, I have to say that the rising fad of "start-ups" in what has been - arguably - a VC bubble (read more) has started to trigger my inner skeptic. Don't get me wrong: I think it's great that we are increasingly encouraging young people to take career risks and try to create value through entrepreneurship. But I couldn't help but be suspicious that there were a fair number of people getting the short end of the "start-up" stick, if for no reason other than the fact that the few friends I had that went to work for early- to mid-stage start-ups left their corporate jobs filled with enthusiasm and are now silently trying to break their way back into what we all know collectively as the machine of corporate America. Curious to learn more, I sat down with a friend of mine who founded a mildly successful internet venture, backed by a sizable portion of angel investment and a recent round of VC funding. While he, as you might expect, was overall very satisfied with his career decisions and current role, he did confess that his experience was far different from the one he had imagined when he first completed his round of VC funding. Perhaps most surprisingly, when I asked him about his thoughts on taking a job at a start-up, his knee-jerk response was, "Don't do it." What ensued was surely one of the most interesting discussions I have had in a long while. Particularly, we addressed many of the "myths" of start-up jobs, and, after doing some independent reading, I though I would share some of the insights. Take them at face value, feel free to dissent, but I found it quite staggering to hear from one of the most entrepreneurial people I know. So with that, a few "myths" of start-up jobs: Start-ups, especially those backed by VC firms, are notoriously stingy with equity. Even those at the top of the organization often have less than 10% stakes in the business, and the chances of them willingly giving out greater shares of equity in a growing business (especially as time goes on) is vanishingly small. Many employees don't see their equity stake meaningfully increased even after years on the job.Perhaps more importantly, promotions, raises and bonuses are exceedingly rare at start-ups. Money is tight at small firms, and there is a prevailing belief that if the business is performing well, the appreciation in your small equity stake makes up for a lack of performance pay (though this is rarely a reflection of reality). 2.5 years after joining a start-up, my friend with considerable programming skills was still making the same salary that he was offered when he joined the firm. What's worse, he knew that at any moment, he could be fired without real cause and with no severance pay to speak of. In most cases, successful start-ups are forced to reach out of the organization for new talent as the business grows. This shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone, but recall that start-ups are often cash-strapped and pay salaries at below-market rates. Inevitably, titles become a form of currency at start-ups - a sort of non-cash compensation that is a key bargaining chip during negotiations with new talent ("we know we can't pay you what Goldman can, but here you'll be the VP of Corporate Finance"). In an attempt to make concrete the value of those titles, organizations have to find a way to keep people enough people in junior positions to give weight to the title of "VP". Since you're currently the bird-in-the-hand, founders are often more likely to give you the snub in order to attract new talent by dangling more-senior titles in front of their faces. That leaves you - well - SOL.       For more myths, head to Wall Street Oasis&gt;
Difei Li / FlickrMorgan Stanley bills this weekend's Italian elections as a "crucial risk event." The euro crisis front has been relatively quiet since ECB President Mario Draghi gave his famous "whatever it takes to save the euro" speech in July, and many analysts have been waiting for this weekend for months. Mario Monti, an unelected technocrat, has been relatively successful in pushing through economic reforms since assuming office in late 2011, but those reforms have driven the country deeper into recession, and record high unemployment shows how Italians are suffering. As a result, former comedian Beppe Grillo and his newly-formed political party, the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, have seen a surge in interest. As the elections draw nearer, the position of establishment political parties heading into the polls appears to be weakening. The fear is that reforms could be hampered, causing Italian bond yields to rise again, causing the European chaos to reignite. Furthermore, the election shows what happens when the goals of the elites goes up against the economic situation of the voters.
In the video below, a man and his wife are at an airport in the Chinese city of Kunming when they are informed they have missed their flight. The man becomes irate. He points angrily at the air stewards on the desk before kicking and smashing everything in sight.  The video has become a hit online, and Shanghaiist reports that it didn't take long for netizens to recognize the man â€” he is Yan Linkun, a member of China's top level government advisory board CPPCC. Local investigators have confirmed it was Yan in the video, and that he apparently missed his flight after getting breakfast with his wife. Yan is now being investigated, and many online observers will be watching closely to see what sort of punishment a high powered official will get in a case like this. Last year, one official photographed smirking at the scene of a tragic accident was fired after netizens were able to reveal his taste for watches far too expensive for his salary bracket.
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price moves. The RSI moves between zero and 100 and is considered overbought with a reading above 70 and oversold when below 30.

Moody's took away the UK's triple A rating late Friday. A ratings downgrade has long been rumored, and although the timing is always surprising, the move itself has long been anticipated. Sterling slumped on the news in thin dealings, losing a cent in about 30 minutes. When it comes to corporate ratings we can appreciate that rating agencies may have access to private information.  They may also be of value in some developing countries, where information is more difficult to secure.  However, when it comes to large developed countries, the rating agencies have access only to public information and it is the same information that investors use to make their decisions. That there is extremely little value-added or new information contained in a rating agency is evident in the lack of market response to downgrades of Japan, the US, Austria, and France, for example.  There is little reason to expect the UK to be an exception to the rule. Some observers are claiming the loss of the UK's AAA rating is a serious blow to the UK government, but we are less convinced.  It is true that UK Prime Minister Cameron and Chancellor of the Exchequer Osborne had hoped its efforts to address the UK's debt and deficit would have averted a downgrade.  The downgrade is not going to deter them from the austerity path upon which they have embarked. It is politically naive to think see the downgrade as some opportunity for them to change course.  They have rejected the IMF's calls to slow the austerity drive  What they did not surrender to the IMF, they will not yield to Moody's or the government's critics who what to use the downgrade to bludgeon the government into accepting its critic's, including the Labour Party's agenda.   Reviewing the rationale behind Moody's decision is like understanding an set of economists' views.  It is a narrative constructed around well known facts.  The global economic weakness, especially in the euro area, and the "ongoing domestic public- and private-sector de-leveraging process" is generating poor growth in the UK and this may persist, Moody's says into the second half of the decade.   The weaker growth means that the debt/GDP ratio will remain elevated for longer.  Moody's doesn't expect it to peak until 2016.  The slower growth and higher debt ratio, in turn, means that the UK's ability to absorb additional future shocks is more limited.  Most investors will find nothing new in that assessment. Ironically, Moody's demonstrated its firm grasp of the obvious the same day that the EU provided updated its forecasts.  It expects the UK economy to expand by 0.9% this year, compared with a 0.3% contraction in the euro zone, which incidentally absorbs 40% of the UK's exports. Lost in the initial reaction by many observers who wrung their hands at the downgrade, Moody's reverted back to a stable outlook for UK debt and the rationale appears to also be shared by many investors.  Simply, even if crudely put, the UK is not Greece.  It has a highly diversified economy and strong institutions/  It has a favorable debt structure.  The average maturity of its debt at 15 years is the highest among the highly rated sovereigns.  It debt servicing capacity remains very strong. Indeed, reading between the lines of Moody's assessment suggests that, arguably, if UK government were to dilute its efforts to address the country's debt and deficits, Moody's may not have been so inclined to offer a stable outlook. From a policy point of view, Cameron's commitment to austerity is taken as given, then any change must come through two other channels:  monetary policy and the currency.  We learned in recent days that BOE Governor King was out-voted for the fourth time in his tenure.  He wanted to resume gilt purchases.  As has often been the case, he will likely get what he wants.  When Carney takes the helm in July, he also may be inclined to ease policy and it will be interesting to see if he is as tolerant of being outvoted. Sterling has fallen 6.7% against the dollar, second among the major currencies to the yen which has lost 7.1% year-to-date.  It has declined about 6% on the BOE's broad trade-weighted measure.  Just like the difference between expansion of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet relative to the BOE's balance sheet cannot explain this decline in sterling, so too sterling's decline may not boost exports as much as some, especially those who have focused on currencies wars, would suspect. There are several reasons for this counter-intuitive assertion.  First, surely we can all agree that foreign demand is important.  As we have noted, a major market for UK goods, the euro area, is expected to contract this year.  The US is also expected to slow from near 2% pace it has averaged since the economy bottomed nearly four years ago. Second, the restructuring of the UK's financial sector and the changes in the globally, may curb its ability to export financial services.  Third, for many goods, there are important non-price dimensions to competitiveness, such a quality, design, speed of service, which will not be impacted by sterling's decline. What this all means is that the UK's exports may be sufficient sensitive to sterling's exchange rate to allow exports to replace the domestic aggregate demand being squeezed by the de-leveraging of the government and households. From an investment point of view, we prefer UK equities over bonds.  The FTSE 100 has a dividend yield of 3.7%, while the 10-year bond yields about 2.1%  Sterling's broad trade-weighted index is the most inversely correlated to the FTSE 100 since early 2007 near -0.44 on a 60-day rolling basis using percent change.  Running the correlation on simply the level of the FTSE 100 and the trade-weighted index is near 0.93, the highest since late-2004.  The sterling-dollar rate is (on a 60-day percent basis) about 0.71 correlated with the trade weighted measure.   Read more posts on Marc to Market »
PeakProsperityThe world is changing, and nowhere is that better illustrated than in a good series of charts. Luckily, we've seen no shortage of excellent charts this week that amply illustrate the changes underway. The best charts this week touch on everything from a mysterious 8:20 AM trading pattern to just how bad Wall Street is at forecasting. Now, let's go to the charts.
Rome, Italy â€” The headquarters for Silvio Berlusconi's party, PDL, is on a narrow street called Via Dell'Umilta at number 36. Via Google Street View, you can see the PDL headquarters on the right. And on the left is something called Elite 2. Google Street View What is Elite 2? We were by there today. It's perfect, given Berlusconi's well-known reputation. Joe Weisenthal, Business Insider But Berlusconi's main office isn't the only office in Rome to have an inappropriate establishment or business nearby. Not far from Berlusconi is the headquarters of the PD, the big rival liberal party. Look what they have right next door: the bank Monte Dei Paschi di Sienna. We'll explain why that's important below. We've circled the PD logo on the left, and the bank logo on the right. Joe Weisenthal, Business Insider Anyway, one reason this election is seemingly as close as it is, is because Monti Dei PaschiÂ  recently required a bailout, and it's extremely closely affiliated with the PD. Siena, where the bank is from and has existed for over 500 years, is a big leftist stronghold, so when the bank recently went down, the PD and its leader Pier Luigi Bersani took a big hit. So both the offices for Berlusconi and the offices for his main rival have perfect establishments nearby that basically tell the whole story of the election. For more on the downfall of Monte Dei Paschi, see this great NYT story that was published on Friday.
Homes available for sale as well as the housing supplies measured in months are now at pre-recession levels, while household formation continues to recover (see post). This development was predicted by William Wheaton back in 2009. Forbes: - Most striking however is the fact that inventory has contracted to its lowest level since December 1999, more than 13 years ago. The number of available homes, which is not seasonally adjusted, fell 4.9% from December and is 25.3% lower than a year ago. With 1.74 million homes on the market, at the current sales pace, supply will be exhausted in just over four months. It represents the lowest housing supply since April 2005. In a normal market, a healthy supply level is about six months. JP Morgan A number of economists continue to talk about the shadow inventory - the millions of homes that are "about to hit the market" as homeowners have or shortly will fail on their mortgages. Some evidence suggests that in the more depressed housing areas banks are indeed sitting on foreclosed properties, unwilling to sell. But a number of banks have also been aggressively modifying mortgages, reducing principal and interest, and therefore cutting delinquencies. Clearly many more homes will be hitting the markets this year. But it really doesn't make much difference if people who move out of these homes end up buying or renting - they need to live somewhere. And according to the Census Bureau, rental vacancies are near a 10-year low. Ironically, the relatively tight credit conditions are (at least partially) restricting new home construction. Completion of new housing units has improved recently but remains at historically depressed levels - certainly not enough to keep up with the population growth and family formation. The danger of course is that with spring approaching (generally a period of increased demand for homes), some markets could overheat due to tight supplies, worsening home affordability and dampening sales numbers.

Wikimedia CommonsItalian front-runner Pier Luigi BersaniThe biggest fear of world markets is that somehow the Italian election (which starts today and ends tomorrow afternoon) will end in chaos. We outlined some of the scenarios here. Since no party is that popular, the next government will have to be formed via coalition, which is pretty standard in European parliamentary politics. To facilitate the formation of coalitions, and to help a government have some semblance of stability, some parliaments award the top vote getting party a "bonus" number of seats in parliament. Greece does this for example. Which ever party comes in first gets an extra 50 seats in parliament. In Italy, which ever party gets the plurality of votes is automatically given 55% of the seats in the Lower house of parliament. So the lower House is not really a concern. Assuming the PD (the center-left party) gets the majority of votes, they'll control the lower House. But in the upper house, the Italian Senate, things get weird. The bonus is awarded by region. So if your party wins in Sicily, you get extra Sicily seats. But on the national level, there's no bonus. So you could have a situation where, say, the center-left party gets the majority of the votes, but where the conservative party (Berlusconi's PDL) does well in big states like Lombardy, and gets huge numbers of extra seats from those states, and prevents the winning party from having a grip on the Senate. And this is a distinct possibility. Berlusconi and his conservative allies run well in the North, including Lombardy, which has such a significant role in the election that people in Italy refer to it as the "Ohio of Italy." Polls there are close, but if the liberal party does well around the country, but slightly fall behind in a couple polls, there could be serious electoral chaos.

AmazonSteve Randy Waldman has an amazing (but very profane) rant about the state of the health care system, keying off of Steven Brill's epic cover story for Time on why health care costs so much. Waldman's post is so angry and profanity-laced, there's really nothing we can share from it, but the paragraph that set him off from the Brill article should legitimately get anyone's blood boiling. By the time Steven D. died at his home in Northern California the following November, he had lived for an additional 11 months. And Alice had collected bills totaling $902,452. The familyâ€™s first bill â€” for $348,000 â€” which arrived when Steven got home from the Seton Medical Center in Daly City, Calif., was full of all the usual chargemaster profit grabs: $18 each for 88 diabetes-test strips that Amazon sells in boxes of 50 for $27.85; $24 each for 19 niacin pills that are sold in drugstores for about a nickel apiece. There were also four boxes of sterile gauze pads for $77 each. None of that was considered part of what was provided in return for Setonâ€™s facility charge for the intensive-care unit for two days at $13,225 a day, 12 days in the critical unit at $7,315 a day and one day in a standard room (all of which totaled $120,116 over 15 days). There was also $20,886 for CT scans and $24,251 for lab work. As for why we can have a system where diabetes-test strips are sold for $18/each in one place, while Amazon sells a box of 50 for $27.85, see this great piece by Sarah Kliff on the lack of price controls in the U.S.
