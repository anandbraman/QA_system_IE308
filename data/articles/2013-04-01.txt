The 65-year-old Pegasus pipeline remained shut off on Monday as emergency crews continue to contain the spill,Â Exxon said in a statementÂ on Monday.Â  The cause of the spill is still under investigation, the company said.Â  Twenty-two homes were evacuated after oil painted lawns, roads, and some ducks. About 12,000 barrels of oil and water have been recovered so far, Exxon said.
Getty Images / Spencer PlattHmm...The year started off with a lot of talk about a "great rotation" of assets out of bonds and into stocks.  The theory was that this shift in everyone's portfolios would cause enormous upward pressure in the stock markets. However, there has been little evidence of a great rotation going on. Meanwhile, stocks have managed to rally to all-time highs. What gives? In a new note titled "The Invisible Buyers," Citi's Tobias Levkovich offers an explanation. Among other things, he makes one important clarification: The stock market is not a zero-sum game. There's a mistaken tendency to think that a dollar that leaves the equity market translates into a dollar less in the stock market. Equity prices often move on a change in perception typically caused by an upside earnings surprise, a takeover announcement, lowered guidance, etc., such that double digit changes can occur without a single dollar even changing hands at that moment. Hence, while flows matter, they aren't everything one should consider. Other facets can be as crucial to the understanding of likely stock price direction including economic trends, investor sentiment, valuation and the attraction of competing assets. This is important because there seems to be a misunderstanding that people cannot be participating in the rally unless they are constantly buying and selling stock. In fact, investors sitting in stocks without trading actually experience the paper fluctuations with everyone else along with the market. Even if the entire rally since the March 2009 bottom was generated by two people exchanging a handful of shares, all of the holders of the outstanding shares would've benefitted.
YouTube/WEFAfter years of relative stability and high profits, things aren't looking particularly rosy for the pharmaceutical industry. Blockbuster drugs are losing patent protection, R&amp;D efforts haven't paid off as hoped, and prices will come under pressure from the Affordable Care Act. Â  Novartis CEO Joseph Jimenez has consistently argued that the industry needs to make big changes in order to survive in the long run, like redefining blockbusters and getting paid for positive outcomes instead of just transactions.Â  His own company just came face to face with one of the industry's big threats, weaker patents and generic competition. Gleevec, a flagship cancer drug, was denied patent protection in India by the country's Supreme Court. Those sorts of rulings are a huge risk when research and development costs can reach billions of dollars.Â  In an interview with Fortune's Geoff Colvin, Jimenez outlined a long term vision for his company and industry: Â  Completely change how drugs get developed In the past, drugs were developed for the biggest populations, people with things like heart disease or diabetes. It's getting harder and harder to improve on what's there and create the next blockbuster. Novartis has been trying a very different strategy. Instead of targeting giant populations, it targets rare diseases with a small, very similar population. That lets scientists figure out the molecular pathway by which the disease works and how to interrupt it.Â  From there, they can expand to other diseases that are affected by the same pathway. Novartis' Afintor, for example, was developed for kidney cancer. Now, after expanded testing, it was approved for breast cancer.Â  "That together will make it a blockbuster," Jimenez said.Â  Finding new uses for existing drugs isn't new. Doing it systematically, scientifically, and aggressively is. Large research budgets still exist. But the pressure for results is higher than ever. Â  Moving beyond Europe and the US This is essential as Europe struggles out of its economic woes, and the US cuts health care spending. Jimenez mentions China and Russia as huge growth opportunities. And in the long run, he's looking to Africa, and he won't be alone.Â  "We have to start building infrastructure now in sub-Saharan Africa, countries like Nigeria and Kenya, because those economies are growing at 6% to 7% per year. Their health care infrastructures are in their infancy," Jimenez says.  In 5-15 years, as these countries grow a middle class, they'll need to be a core part of pharmaceutical company's business.Â  But these markets come with problems. Most patients in these countries pay for medicines out of pocket, so companies can't charge very much relative to the government and insurance-backed western countries. Patents are a big issue as well. After the Gleevec ruling in India, Novartis isÂ seriously consideringÂ if and how it will bring new drugs to the country. The Wall Street Journal talked to Novartis spokesman Eric Althoff about the ruling, who said that "if innovation is rewarded, there is clear business case to move forward. If it isn't rewarded and protected, there isn't." These markets are going to be hugely important, but the amount of economic and legal uncertainty makes entering them a difficult balancing act. "You're seeing technology explode," Jimenez says, particularly when it comes to oncology. The ability to sequence human genomes more quickly and deeply, and analyze the information better has a huge amount of potential. The wealth of data "will allow new areas of discovery that have never been possible before," Jimenez says. The challenge is going to be the leap from all of that promise to actual medicines, by, for example, figuring out how to target the specific mutations that cause cancers. The companies that succeed will need to get better at mining data and combining IT and research instead of keeping them in separate silos.Â  The idea of all drug discovery coming from people in white coats sitting at a bench or from doctors is going to have to change.Â 
The latest Economics Asia Bloomberg Brief, put out by Michael McDonough, has a great section on the potential for the Chinese auto industry. McDonough writes: "China’s goal of doubling per capita income by 2020 may boost auto sales 144 percent to almost 4 million vehicles a month, more than three times the current U.S. total." So how will it get so big? These three charts really drive home how big it could be. Bloomberg Brief Bloomberg Brief Bloomberg Brief Check out more Bloomberg Brief content here ---&gt;
The Japanese stock market is having another ugly day, falling by over 2 percent early in Asia's Tuesday trading session. Later this week, the Bank of Japan will be holding its first interest rate meeting with uber-dove Haruhiko Kuroda at the helm. However, its possible that easy monetary policy is fully, if not more than priced in to the markets. This could be explaining this week's sell-off. Here's a look at the falling Nikkei and strengthening yen via Nikkei.com. Nikkei
On Friday, an Exxon-owned oil pipeline malfunctioned, causing thousands of gallons of crude to spill through the town of Mayflower, Ark. Via AllThingsD, here's an insane video of the aftermath that forced dozens to evacuate. Cleanup has begun, but Reuters says the company still has notÂ excavated the area around the breach, "a critical step in assessing damage and determining how and why it leaked." This is ugly. (As seen on @chrislhayes' new show All In)
A quick reminder: European PMI readings for the month of March come out tomorrow morning. They're likely to be very ugly. Flash PMI numbers for France and Germany were both bad, and there's no real sign that any data is improving anywhere. There are virtually no green shoots to speak of. Today it was reported that Spain was again revising down its growth forecasts for 2013. The endless decline of the economy is the real killer in Europe. That leads to bank stress, sovereign stress, and political stress. Without improvement none of that gets fixed. We'll be covering the European PMI numbers early Tuesday. As for what happened in the US sessions, see here &gt;
The Fast Diet Nina Buckley is a sucker for donuts, McDonald's Big Macs, and Indian takeout â€” food hankerings that can easily derail any diet devotee's quest to lose weight. That's why after three months on Weight Watchers, the mother of three found she had actually gained a few pounds. "It's like being teased with your favorite foods you can't have," said Buckley, 28, who lives in England but is originally from Romania. Buckley is one of the countless men and women who are grappling with how to eliminate pounds without having to sacrifice a lot of food. The FastDiet, which recommends eating about a quarter of your typical calorie intake for two days a week, and eating normally for the other five, meets dieters half-way.Â Buckley has taken toÂ this "forgiving" diet approach. Â  The FastDiet's designers, Dr. Michael Mosley and journalist Mimi Spencer, both of the U.K., claim that their 5:2 plan makes you lose weight faster than other diets. They've written a book about the science behind their diet theory and why they think it works. During these "fasting days" dieters can take in their calories â€” a maximum of 600 for men and 500 for women â€” in one meal or break it into multiple small plates.Â  As for whether it works, as always, the proof is in the pudding. Buckley claims to have lost 13 pounds after four weeks. She's done it by eating chicken and steamed broccoli,Â chili con carne, and yes, even pork casserole, all for 500 little calories or less during her fasting days.Â  "This diet it's easy because I know I have to be strict for only two days, then the rest of the week I'm eating when I'm hungry. My appetite has reduced significantly," said Buckley.Â  A Facebook fanpage allows fellow FastDieters to interact by sharing their meals, and weight-loss success. Â  We've rounded up some of the meals to give you an idea of what FastDiet meals are like. Most of them look good. There are lots of vegetables and lean proteins. The question is: how long did the dieters last?
Youtube/JointEconCommitteeThe debate is raging on Capitol Hill over whether the era of ‘too big to fail’ banks has truly ended.  Now, one player has emerged who might finally answer the question that has dogged Wall Street and lawmakers ever since Lehman Brothers went belly up in 2008.  It’s not a big name. Others have been in the spotlight when discussing whether the 2010 Dodd-Frank reforms actually reinforced taxpayer-funded safety nets for Wall Street, instead of removing them as intended. Attorney General Eric Holder indicated last month that criminal charges against a powerful bank might destabilize the markets. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke conceded to reporters a few weeks ago that the problem of ‘too big to fail’ persists, even if regulators have made some progress in introducing new controls. “It is not solved and gone,” Bernanke said. “[It’s] a real problem and needs to be addressed if at all possible.”  In the Senate, Democrat Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Republican David Vitter of Louisiana are pairing up on a new bill to limit the size of the country’s biggest banks. Dallas Federal Reserve Bank president Richard Fisher is crusading around the country with his own plan to do the same. Thomas Hoenig, vice-chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, penned an op-ed in last Friday’s Washington Post that the government subsidizes the nation’s largest banks. Nope. Not a big name at all, even though it could help to settle the debate by virtue of its data-driven philosophy. THE $100 MILLION MAN Few Americans have heard of the Office of Financial Research—and even some DC insiders occasionally forget about the $100 million-plus agency created by Dodd-Frank. It lacked a director until the start of this year, when Richard Berner—previously one of the top economists for Morgan Stanley and a counselor for former Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner—received a long-awaited Senate confirmation. It could be Berner's work over his six-year term that determines whether ‘too big to fail’ is over or more dangerous than ever. The trouble is that the office—which is contained inside the Treasury Department—has been slow to get on its feet as the controversy smolders. “They’ve been in the process of setting up for a couple of years,” explained Marc Jaruslic, a former Senate staffer who is now chief economist for Better Markets, an advocacy group pushing for tighter regulation. “I’d really like to see the OFR play the role intended for it in the statute. … We’re just missing a very important voice.” The mission at the Office of Financial Research is to track previously hidden financial data and identify potential risks to the economy, a process that requires the agency to develop an unprecedented system for monitoring in real-time Wall Street and its darkest of alleys. Before the 2008 financial crisis, regulators essentially tried to oversee the markets by looking through the rearview mirror. The shortage of real-time information made it difficult for regulators to fully understand the problems of mortgage-backed securities and the highly-leveraged firms with a web of vast, unseen connections. Through its research and analysis, the OFR can report independently to Congress on dangerous patterns in the markets. It also advises the Financial Stability Oversight Council—the group of 10 federal regulators responsible for overseeing the companies that might pose a threat to the entire financial system. BANK DATA: TOO BIG TO NAIL? The current debate about ‘too big to fail’ is missing a referee, a data wonk to fact-check the hailstorm of statistics that get thrown about. Plenty of competing studies have been produced on ‘too big to fail,’ but nothing definitive enough to set another change in policy since 2010. The trouble is that the OFR is still in its embryonic stages. “This would be a perfect topic for an independent, nonpartisan, disinterested, dispassionate organization to do some serious research into the size and origin of the purported cost of funding advantage,” said John Dearie, executive vice president for policy at the Financial Services Forum, which represents 19 of the sector’s largest companies. “It’s unfortunate that they’re not at the place in terms of resources and manpower to contribute to this debate.” The OFR currently has about 140 staffers, half the number envisioned for this year under past budget proposals. For now, its major initiative involves finalizing a unique code—known as a Legal Entity Identifier—to detect exactly which firms are involved in individual trades before the end of 2013, a key tool the government does not currently have. The office is also studying asset management firms and the markets for the short-term funding of companies. The OFR noted in its annual review last summer that ‘too big to fail’ persisted as a risk to the economy, but its synopsis added little to the conversation. Berner struggled in part to receive confirmation because some Republican lawmakers feared that the agency could adopt a Big Brother-like surveillance of the markets. The University of Pennsylvania PhD takes to the job confident that the situation has improved, even though just 37 percent of the rules attached to Dodd-Frank have been finalized. “In fact, the adoption of financial reforms here and abroad has, in my view, brightened the financial risk outlook, and I am more optimistic as a result,” Berner said in a speech last month at a risk management convention, saying that banks are relying less on leverage and the markets are more transparent after Dodd-Frank. THE BREAK-UP ARGUMENTThe stock market may be eclipsing its previous highs, but a huge political appetite still exists for breaking up the largest financial institutions out of concern that they are simply too complex and gargantuan for anyone to oversee. That argument was even championed last year by Sandy Weill, the architect of the merger that formed Citigroup. This appeals on a populist level to those who still feel slighted about Wall Street executives getting taxpayer-funded bonuses as millions of homeowners faced eviction. When Dallas Fed President Fisher talked up his plan to keep Wall Street off the public dime, he stopped by the Conservative Political Action Conference best known for its straw poll of GOP presidential contenders. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who came to office with a reputation to fight banks, picked up media coverage at a Senate Banking Committee hearing where she grilled Bernanke about government preferences for larger financial institutions. Fears about another bailout persist because many of the nation’s largest banks have grown after the 2008 meltdown, in part through mergers with institutions such as Bear Stearns that were on the verge of collapse. Federal filings indicate that a dozen institutions control 69 percent of all banking assets—with the biggest players being JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs. Dodd-Frank embraced tighter capital controls and living wills for institutions that in theory pose a systemic threat—including all banks with $50 billion in assets. By having the living wills, the companies can supposedly be liquidated without a government bailout or economic disruption. But critics of the law note that the government may have inadvertently signaled to the markets which institutions could be ‘too big to fail’ by requiring the living will. Hoenig at the FDIC and Brown in the Senate stress that a regime of government guarantees—deposit insurance, loans from the Fed, and the precedent of the previous $800 billion rescue under the Troubled Assets Relief Program—mean that large banks might still enjoy advantages in funding and take economy-wrecking risks at taxpayer expense. When Warren sharply questioned Bernanke on the issue, she relied on an analysis by the International Monetary Fund about mega-banks being able to borrow at cheaper rates than their competitors because of indirect government backing. Five of the financial industry’s largest associations—including the American Bankers Association and the Financial Services Forum—quickly criticized her conclusion as inaccurate because the study relied on estimates from 2007 to 2009 that pre-dated the passage of Dodd-Frank. When given a chance to offer his perspective on the matter last month, Berner decided not to weigh in, deferring instead at a House Financial Services subcommittee hearing on oversight and investigations to the opinion of Amias Gerety, the Treasury Department’s deputy assistant secretary for the Financial Stability Oversight Council. Freshman Rep. John Delaney, D-Md., asked on March 14 if either entity was studying whether the markets perceive the government as having stopped ‘too big to fail.’ Berner stayed silent and let Gerety answer the question. “That perception, if it exists, is incorrect,” Gerety said. “We’re aware of the debate, but the action of Dodd-Frank does not allow that perception to become a reality.”   Related links:

APIndia's Supreme Court has set an important precedent in refusing to grant a patent to Novartis for an updated version of its cancer drug Glivec. The verdict will allow generic drug makers within the country to continue selling cheap versions of the drug, which is used to treat chronic myeloid leukemia and other cancers. The BBC notes that Novartis' drug costs $2,600, while generic versions of the drug cost just $175. The court's decision is based on one specific part of India's patent law: section 3(d). Here's how it reads: Screenshot “It's all about interpretation of section 3(d) of the Indian Patent Act,” Ran Chakrabarti, a commercial lawyer based in New Delhi, told the Telegraph. “Essentially, it says that you can't tweak something that already exists and then patent it, if it doesn't enhance the known efficacy of that thing, or result in a new product," he said. The Court denied the patent as it said it offered only minor improvements on the old patent, which had expired after 20 years. According to Reuters, shares in Novartis' Indian arm ended 1.8 percent lower after falling 6.8 percent after the verdict. Novartis and other big drug companies say the ruling will hurt innovation in India, and Novartis has threatened to stop supplying India with its drugs following the ruling. Others argue that the ruling helps India's many poor cancer sufferers who cannot afford brand name drugs. 40% of the Indian population live under the poverty line (living on $1.25 or less), and Reuters has reported that the average citizen spends just $4.50 in medical costs per year. According to the Financial Times, some 70 percent of these healthcare costs are paid for by the consumer themself. The verdict may also even force drug companies to push for real innovations, rather than "evergreening" with minor improvements to keep the patent. Crucially, 3(d) calls for improved "efficiency" in requirements for a new patent — something can't just be new, it has to be better. "Drug companies are going to have to come up with something pretty unique to get patent protection, and while that's good news for consumers, it pushes the threshold for innovation northwards." Chakrabarti told the Telegraph. The ruling could set a precedent as a patents on a variety of other drugs are due to expire soon. In a statement about the ruling, Novartis makes clear that they feel this is Section 3(d) is an unfairly high hurdle: Glivec has been awarded patents in nearly 40 other countries, including China, Russia and Taiwan, but the IPAB is denying one for India. The IPAB acknowledges that Glivec satisfies the international requirements for novelty and inventiveness, but it does not find Glivec to meet the requirement under Section 3(d) of the Indian Patents Act of 2005. This act introduced a new efficacy enhancement hurdle for patenting new forms of known compounds. We believe that Section 3(d), the Indian legal paragraph intended as a hurdle for evergreening, should not be applicable to the breakthrough medicine Glivec, which has changed the lives of patients with rare cancers. India's generic drugs manufacturers are some of the largest in the world, thanks to laws that used to allow patents only for drug manufacture processes, not the final product, allowing companies to reverse-engineer many drugs.  While those laws were changed in 2005 to gain World Trade Organization membership, generic drug manufacturers still find loopholes that allow them to undercut big pharmaceutical firms, sometimes by as much as 75 percent. It's a big business for the country, as India exports generic drugs worth $11 billion, according to the BBC. International drug companies may also lament Indian plans to give away $5.4 billion in prescription drugs over the next 5 years, with branded drugs banned from the plan. The Indian government has also discussed plans to cap prices on some drugs,
MorningstarJack Bogle is the founder and chairman of mutual-fund giant Vanguard Group and is widely credited for popularizing index funds, a staple for buy-and-hold investors. Today, he was on CNBC, and he had a bit of a startling prediction. CNBC anchor Scott Wapner put the question to Bogle: "You say, 'prepare for at least two declines of 25-30 percent, maybe even 50 percent, in the coming decade.' For a buy-and-hold guy, that's a little concerning, don't you think?" Bogle replied:Â  Not at all. They come and go. The market goes up, and the market goes down. It's never failed to recover from one of those 50 percent declines. I went through one in 1973-1974, I went through one in 2001, 2002, 2003; I went through another one 2008-2009. They're kind of scary â€“ often terrifying â€“ but it's typical. Why it doesn't bother me is if you hang on through the cycle, that's the only way to invest. Trying to guess when it's going to go way up or way down is simply not a productive way to put your money to work. Bogle's comments don't represent any sort of shift in his philosophy â€“ he remains as big a proponent of buy-and-hold investing as ever. Of course, if Bogle is right about two 50-percent declines in the next decade, it's going to be a trying experience for the buy-and-hold crowd. Click here to watch the full interview &gt;
Henry Blodget / Business InsiderI was in London recently, so I stopped by Harrods. Harrods is the most famous store in the world, so it's not something you miss.  And Harrods is also under new ownership. In 2010, the Egyptian mogul Mohamed Al-Fayed sold Harrods to Qatar for $1.5 billion. The deal was a big deal. Only a couple of weeks earlier, Al-Fayed had bristled when asked whether he would ever sell Harrods. Then the Prime Minister of Qatar showed up with his checkbook. And, just like that, London's iconic and historic shopping mecca got flipped to another foreign investor. So now that Qatar owns Harrods, the obvious question is...   Is Qatar ruining Harrods? Based on the crowds that filled the place when I was there, the answer appears to be 'no.' But some long-time Harrods watchers I know lament the state of the place. Harrods has gone downhill, they say. Harrods has become less unique. Harrods has become, well, just another department store. I'm no Harrods expert, so I'll let you all weigh in on this. I did spend some time in the Harrods famous food halls with my camera, though. So I've got some visuals to share. Those food halls, I must say, certainly seemed plenty unusual and impressive to me...

APContradicting what I wrote in my previous post about IRAs being irrelevant to upper-middle class and wealthy people, we have the curious case of Mitt Romney, who reported in his 2010 tax returns an IRA worth between $20 million and $100 million.  At that level of assets, I must acknowledge he’s the exception to my rule of IRA irrelevancy for high income people. An IRA at $20 million to $100 million has gone from humble and homely to something quite sexy and amazing.  In other words – as my wife would say – Mitt Romney’s IRA is Bradley Cooper in Silver Linings Playbook. At first glance you may be tempted to shrug your shoulders at the size of Romney’s IRA.  After all, since he’s a wealthy and successful businessman, isn’t that kind of what you’d expect?  Ummmmmm, no. It’s so incredibly unusual to amass that kind of wealth inside an IRA that I’m kind of hoping to crowd-source the answer to this mystery.  I mean, I can speculate below, and I will, but I would really love for someone more knowledgeable than me to guide me in the process.[1] Here’s why it’s hard: throughout most of Romney’s working life, the individual IRA contribution limits were $1,500 to $2,000.  The limits jumped to $3,000, $4,000, and $5,000 in 2002, 2005 and 2008 respectively, but all of that is too recent to benefit from the real power of compound interest to get up above $20 million. I am as aware of the incredible power of compound interest to grow humble seeds of capital into mighty oak trees as anyone, but the investment math involved here is not, let’s say, frequently observed. A simple, but probably wrong, assumption Assuming Romney was eligible to make the maximum IRA contributions from 1974 onward[2], and did so, he was eligible to contribute a total of $94,500 over the years 1974 to 2010, to his personal IRA.[3] By applying a relentless 24.5% compounding return to each and every theoretical maximum Mitt Romney contribution from 1974 to 2010, we can in fact arrive at a total summed value of $21.5 Million.     This is mathematically possible, but highly improbable in the real investing world.  Not every investment goes up in a rocky, volatile risky world.  And nobody relentlessly returns 24.5%, for 36 years, in the real world.  (Except, of course, Stephen A Cohen.)  Or 30.7%, the amount Romney would need to achieve a total IRA over $100 million. A slightly more realistic picture of how Romney grew his IRA A more realistic set of assumptions would assume that Romney rolled over his employer-sponsored plan like the Bain Capital SEP-IRA, which allowed for average contributions of $30,000 per year.  If he regularly socked away $30,000 in his primary Bain Capital years, 1984 to 1999, he’d still have needed to average a 21% return over those 15 years to get above the minimum $20 million threshold, or over a 29% return, each and every year, to reach $100 million. These returns are also extraordinary, but because they may have happened over a 15-year period rather than 36 year period, they become a tad more believable.  The years 1984 to 1999 also coincided with an incredible bull-market run in public equity markets, which while not directly related to the private markets in which Bain Capital specialized, would tend to buoy Bain Capital’s access to liquidity, leverage, investor confidence, and exit strategies over the 15 years. Most importantly for the IRA discussion, however, is the key point that a SEP-IRA really isn’t the humble, homely individual IRA we started out discussing.  When you can contribute $30,000 per year it’s not a fair comparison to the traditional personal IRA, but rather more akin to a super-charged 401K plan. So seemingly-homely Bradley Cooper was really sexy Bradley Cooper all along, not someone recently released from a mental hospital trying desperately to keep his world together. But still, how could Romney earn 21 to 29% year after year after year for 15 years? Ok fine, I’ll contribute to the speculation, which has to remain speculation because Romney never publicly explained his IRA success. The Wall Street Journal offered a plausible explanation of Romney’s IRA success last year. The Wall Street Journal article explains it the following way: Bain Capital employees including Romney (as then CEO) apparently co-invested their SEP-IRAs alongside other Bain Capital funds, and probably received different classes of shares than did traditional Bain Capital investors.  The different classes of shares, the speculation goes, could have systematically low values because they represented junior, or riskier, pieces of Bain Capital investments. These systematically low-priced share-classes of the Bain Capital co-investments frequently popped in value on successful investments.  When the investments worked, as they often did, these initially low-valued, risky shares offered much higher returns that we would normally find in public markets. It sounds plausible, risky, legal, and not particularly replicable for ordinary investors.

[2] This assumption is unlikely to be true, since he was in a combined Harvard Law School and Harvard Business School program in 1974 and 1975, but it is possible, so I’ll give him the benefit of the doubt. [3] This $94,500 includes the ‘catch-up’ amounts he became eligible for, starting in 2002, for being over age 50. Post read (381) times.
The parabolic rise of Bitcoin has caught a lot of people off guard this year and is generating a ton of investor interest. Nick Colas at ConvergEx Group, the only Wall Street strategist we know of so far who has written about the Bitcoin market, says all of his clients think the virtual currency is in a bubble. When one looks at a chart, going all the way back to 2010, it's easy to see why the word "bubble" is being tossed around among investors. Whether it continues to go up is anyone's guess, but Colas thinks there are five broad themes converging to create a "perfect storm" behind the current rise of Bitcoin.

As ordered by a New York Court, Argentina submitted its plan to pay hedge fund creditors one hour before deadline last night. Now, the words "pay" and "plan" may sound constructive, but they're actually not. In fact, this plan will probably make the country's legal battle over $1.3 billion worth of sovereign debt even uglier since, according to Bloomberg, the country submitted basically the same plan in 2010 to no one's satisfaction. The plan would force creditors, lead by billionaire Paul Singer, to do exactly what they refused to do in 2005 and again in 2010 â€” take a massive haircut on Argentine debt. From Bloomberg: â€œThe Argentines made no compromisesâ€ in their new payment offer, said Eric Fine, who helps oversee about $5 billion of emerging-market assets at Van Eck Global in New York. They are â€œplaying for either delay or confrontation, neither of which is positive.â€ If the country is looking for a delay, they could take their case to a panel of even more Judges, or try to take it to the Supreme Court, but most analysts think that's very unlikely. Confrontation, on the other hand, could mean that a Court orders Argentina to pay the holdouts immediately. That would leave it open to $43 billion in additional claims that it can't pay and could trigger a default on its debt. For around a decade, Argentina has refused to pay Singer and his fellow so-called "vulture capitalist" holdouts 100 cents on the dollar on principle.  The fight got so nasty that Singer had a Ghanaian port impound an Argentine naval vessel last October, and it took an international Court ruling to get the ship back home. Since then, Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner has made special travel plans to avoid having her state jet impounded as well. In November, a New York Court sided with Singer and his group, ordering Argentina to pay every cent. A month ago an Appeals Court ordered Argentina to come up with a plan to do that. That's why the Singer and co. are going to feel like they've been disrespected. Ignoring the November ruling, Argentina offered to pay creditors only 1/6th of what they're owed. To explain why, Argentine Finance Minister HernÃ¡n Lorenzino reiterated the same argument that the country has maintained all along â€” that paying the holdouts would be a slap in the face to over 90% of bondholders that took haircuts willingly. One analyst described Argentina's payment plan submission as "thumbing its nose" at the entire situation, and today Argentine bonds are taking a beat down, with yields climbing to their highest level since June 2009. The government's next scheduled payment is on April 4th. It needs to pay out $161 million worth of interest for bonds due in 2038. It's also worth noting that in February, Argentine Central Bank reserves hit their lowest level since 2007 at $42.65 billion.

flickr/Peter TaylorIt's probably fair to say that the big rise in Bitcoin this year has caught many by surprise. Today, the value of one Bitcoin hit $100. In early March, they were trading below $35. In January, they were trading below $15. We've noticed a lot of interest from readers and investors in recent weeks as the virtual currency has gone parabolic. However, as of yet, we only know of one Wall Street analyst who has taken up writing about Bitcoin: ConvergEx Group Chief Market Strategist Nick Colas. Naturally, we were curious what Colas was hearing from his clients, who we figured must be asking some questions as well. Here is what Colas told us (emphasis added): The reaction from clients has been pretty uniform: it must be a bubble. Too far, too fast, too new … you get the idea.  Moreover, it’s very hard to short Bitcoins, so there’s no real way to express that pessimistic point of view, which is saving a lot of people some real money, since Bitcoin has some solid momentum just now. Where is all of the momentum behind the Bitcoin trade coming from? Colas bullets a few points: The term "perfect storm" fits here, even if it is a bit of a cliche at this point, says Colas. Where it goes next is anyone's guess, but Colas thinks the next big thing to watch out for will be whether mainstream businesses start accepting Bitcoin as payment in a more widespread fashion.

FA Insights is a daily newsletter from Business Insider that delivers the top news and commentary for financial advisors. The Market Is Strenuously Overvalued, Overbought, And Overbullish (Advisor Perspectives)  John Hussman at Hussman Funds thinks the market is "strenuously overvalued, overbought, and overbullish." He expects that most of the gains made since 2009 will be lost when the market corrects.  "We know that these conditions have historically made trend-following measures unreliable. What we donâ€™t know is precisely when today's compressed and complacent risk premiums will crawl or spike higher, and one thing weâ€™ve learned from testing hundreds of investment methods over a century of data is that many approaches that perform beautifully over the long-term would often have felt intolerable at a day-to-day resolution. "...Frankly, I don't believe there is much question that our concerns will prove correct. The question is whether investors will abandon a proper, studied, but uncomfortable defensiveness, as many did in 2000 and 2007, because they could no longer bear to witness the temporary success of reckless speculators." Independent Advisors Do Still Sell Commission-Based Products (The Wall Street Journal) Financial advisors that work at independent investment advisory firms point out that they are no longer required to sell their company's own commission-based products. But they do sell commission-based products of other firms.Â  A study from Aite Group shows that they get about as much of their revenue from commissions as their counterparts at big brokerages. What's more, an increasing number of advisors are now registered to do commission-based work and as fee-only advisors.  It's A Mistake To Assume We're Due For A Stock Market Sell-Off (Deutsche Bank) With stocks at all time highs, many anticipate a correction. But Deutsche Bank's David Bianco writes that a sell-off isn't necessarily imminent. "Dips of 5%+ are inevitable, but they donâ€™t happen in absence of bad news or emerging risk. â€¦Since 1960, the average number of trading days in-between 5%+ dips is 118 and in- between 10%+ corrections is 357 days. The [standard deviation] is 92 and 387 days, respectively." Deutsche Bank Â  10 Signs That Show The Stock Market Is Overbought (Gluskin Sheff) Despite the recent stock market highs, David Rosenberg sees 10 signs that the stock market is overbought. 1. Too much exuberance. 2. Average daily volume is 12 percent lower than a year ago. 3. Lower share of NYSE-traded stocks are trading above their 50-day averages. 4. Insider selling has increased. 5. The defensive sector is seeing highs, not cyclical stocks. 6. Bulls are investing cautiously. 7. NYSE short positions were up 2.4 percent in the first half of March. 8. In each of the last three years, Q1 rallies were followed by a sell-off. 9. Buying power is nearly exhausted. 10. Dow theory advocates have gone silent.

Getty ImagesTheÂ Washington PostÂ reportedÂ Monday that Caroline Kennedy will likely be named the U.S. Ambassador to Japan, replacing John Roos, who has held the position since 2009.Â  But why Kennedy and why now?Â  The thing to bear in mind is that ambassadorships are frequently offered as rewards to top supporters. Kennedy, the daughter of the late John F. Kennedy,Â has long been rumored to be under consideration for a coveted ambassadorshipÂ in President Barack Obama's administration. She has been a high-profile supporter of the President, and her endorsement of Obama during the 2008 Democratic primary â€” given in aÂ New York TimesÂ op-ed,"A President Like My Father"Â â€” was seen as a big boost for the relatively unknown-Illinois Senator. But Kennedy's early endorsement came with a political price, straining her relationship with Obama's rival â€” and later Secretary of State â€” Hillary Clinton.Â  Now that Clinton has left State, however, an opportunity has opened up for Kennedy to take a prime ambassadorship. Her relationship is much stronger with Obama's new Secretary of State, John Kerry, who served alongside her uncle Ted Kennedy as Massachusetts Senators.Â

Small-cap stocks have been lagging the market recently. Miller Tabak's Jonathan Krinsky brings this to clients' attention today, writing, "Generally, when the small-caps show relative weakness vs. the large caps, it is a sign that investors are moving out of the riskier/high-beta names and into the 'relative safety' of the large/mega-caps." Perhaps the best way to see this rotation out of small-caps and into large-caps is by charting the ratio of the Russell 2000 (a small-cap index) to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (an index of large-caps). When the ratio goes down, investors are moving into bigger, safer names. That's what is happening right now. Krinsky points out that this ratio peaked in February 2012, before the S&amp;P 500 ultimately peaked in early April, as shown by the arrows in the chart below. Business Insider/Matthew Boesler, data from Bloomberg The chart also shows that the Russell 2000/DJIA ratio has peaked again and appears to be headed lower. "This is by no means a guarantee of a market top of course," says Krinsky. "We saw this ratio plunge from July to August 2012, even as the S&amp;P grinded higher." This time, it might be saying something prescient, though, given the fact that the market rally hasn't really faced a major test yet. "When put in context, however, and combined with many of the other factors we have been highlighting, it should certainly be given some consideration," says Krinsky.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch's contrarian Sell Side indicator, which gauges Wall Street's sentiment toward stocks, climbed to 47.3 in March.Â  However, it's still at a level that reflects extreme bearishness. Here's an excerpt from BAML's report (emphasis ours): With the S&amp;P 500â€™s indicated dividend yield above 2%, that implies a 12-month price return of 26% and a 12-month value of 1975. Although this is not our official S&amp;P 500 target, this model is an input into our target, which incorporates valuation, sentiment and technicals. Historically, when our indicator has been below 50, total returns over the subsequent 12 months have been positive 100% of the time, with median 12-month returns of +30%. Past performance is not an indication of future results. Â  Bank of America Merrill Lynch
YouTubeMichael Lewis' latest piece for The New Republic explores his childhood as a gentile going to a Jewish school in New Orleans, the Isidore Newman School. He was asked to return to the place where he was "incarcerated" from age 5 to 17 to address the Cum Laude Society â€” a society to which he never belonged. Since it's Michael Lewis, the essay reads like a clean, simple reflection but when all is said and done, it's clear the piece is about the ongoing negotiation between who we are, who we were, and how the world sees us. Lewis went back home to be treated with respect and to be held up as a hero, but in reality, he says, he was a pretty rowdy kid, and the memories all came back to him as he sat ready to receive an award. From The New Republic: ....slow-motion replays of the several times I nearly succeeded in getting myself tossed out of the Isidore Newman School. There was the hook report of Johnny Tremain, pathetically plagiarized word for word from a long blurb Oil the back of the dust jacket. There was the English teacher to whom, in the wake of her scathing and accurate evaluation of my person, I had actually said, "Are you always so pleasant to deal with or is this just an especially good day for you?" Then there was the perhaps first ever attempt to read a pornographic subtext into that singular portrait of childhood innocence, To Kill a Mockingbird. You may recall that one of its characters is a boy named Dill, who, possibly to emphasize his rootlessness, was given no last name. Possessed by some demon, I raised my eight-grade hand and announced my discovery that Dill's father was named Robert Doe. The teacher stood frozen in place as I prodded him with the obvious follow-up questions: "So what does that make Dill's name now? At least he knew how to stand out, right?

">WikipediaSince I found out Iâ€™d been admitted to HBS in R1, others have asked me how I did it, how I got in. Usually, I say I hit refresh on my application status every 3 seconds until it changed to â€œadmittedâ€. I hesitate to answer seriously because I donâ€™t want anyone to follow my path as a blueprint for admission. My story started during my junior year at a service academy. I was taking my first classes as an econ major and went on a field trip to HBS where we did a mock case with HBS faculty. I still remember the case â€“ a comparison of Coach K and Bobby Knightâ€™s leadership styles. Thatâ€™s what sparked my interest. Iâ€™d always been pretty good academically, but the prospect of business school gave me even more reason to focus on my academics. I barricaded myself in my room the rest of junior and senior year, ultimately graduating with a 3.9. For the next five years, business school had to wait - I owed the army five years for my free education. It didnâ€™t take long to decide that I didnâ€™t want to make the army a career â€“ having little say in assignments or locations, seeing incompetent officers given less work/responsibility while earning the same pay and same promotions, seeing high-performing officers given crushing workloads with no reward or prospect of early advancement, etc. So, like anyone with a good deal of time on his hands, I prepared. I read everything I could about business school â€“ books, forums, consultant blogs, school guides. And then I studied for three solid months. It paid off â€“ 750Â GMATÂ and I held a celebratory GMAT study guide bonfire in my backyard. Iâ€™d gotten myself solid numbers, but that alone wasnâ€™t going to get me into schools. I needed more. I volunteered at an animal shelter but it didnâ€™t feel right; it was contrived. After struggling with the issue for several months, I resolved to do sincere service only, and I eventually found myself teaching my soldiers personal finance in the natural course of my job. I kept that up. As application season drew near, I knew essays were my chance to give color to my story. Iâ€™m not a writer, but Iâ€™d jotted leadership stories in a journal that fellow vets encouraged me to keep. Picking ones that fit the various prompts, I went through 6-8 drafts of each essay to make sure the real me showed through, not some black and white, standards-loving army guy.

One of the aspects of the Cyprus bank bailout deal hatched by the EU and the Cypriot government in March that has been noted as a big positive by analysts across Wall Street is the fact that it won't hurt the sovereign's creditworthiness in the same way it would if deposits weren't used to fund the bailout. The chart below, from Morgan Stanley, is a simple illustration of the argument. Morgan Stanley Restructuring experts LeeÂ Buchheit of Cleary Gottlieb, and Mitu Gulati of Duke Law School put it this way: Cypriot sovereign bonds will emerge unscathed. The next bond maturing onÂ June 3, 2013 in the amount of â‚¬1.4 billion â€“ a large chunk of which is reputedÂ to have been bought by international hedge funds over the last six months atÂ prices ranging from 70-75 cents on the euro â€“ will be paid out at 100 centsÂ on the euro in about ten weeks. Hedge funds luck out in this case. They own "around half" of the June 2013 bonds, according to IFR reporters Natalie Harris and John Geddie (emphasis added): According to market sources, around half of the June 2013 bond is owned byÂ hedge funds, but while its price has fallen by around seven points this week, a restructuring of Cyprus' EUR4bn sovereign debt is not on the table. The decision to spare sovereign bondholders and shift the burden to private creditors (uninsured depositors, in the case of Cyprus) has been heralded as a new "approach" to dealing with euro zone bailouts by Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who currently serves as President of the Eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers (the instrumental EU apparatus for negotiating bailouts with member states). However, from a hedge fund manager's perspective, not that much has really changed. Before the Cyprus deal and this supposed shift in the EU's approach to handling bailouts, it was all about putting the risks on taxpayers â€“ in order to avoid contagion. In other words, every time hedge funds bet on the taxpayer coming to the rescue â€“ the opposite of what happened in Cyprus â€“ they were rewarded. "Opportunistic hedge funds have profited handsomely from the euro zone crisis, be it by speculating in Greek bonds or by buying up the senior debt of failed Spanish banks," wrote New York Times financial correspondent Landon Thomas in December. "They have successfully bet that Europe, ever fearful of Greek-style contagion, will prefer taxpayer-financed bailouts to forcing concessions from the private sector." After all, the reason it was profitable for hedge funds to bet on the taxpayer in all of those previous instances is that doing the opposite meant betting on a scenario that could unleash serious contagion in financial markets â€“ something that EU leaders have reacted to and sought to avoid time and again throughout the euro crisis, which is now entering its fourth year. The whole crux of the European strategy has been to contain government borrowing costs in crisis countries, taking pressure off of governments in order to allow them time to implement difficult economic reforms. That is why ECB President Mario Draghi's announcement of "Outright Monetary Transactions" (OMT) in August, which supposedly provides a monetary backstop for those crisis countries, was considered such a gamechanger by euro zone sovereign bond markets, and bond yields have continually moved lower since then as a result. In Cyprus, European leaders may have decided that throwing sovereign bondholders under the bus would ultimately put that strategy in jeopardy. Instead of discussing that, though, much has been made of the idea that the decision to force haircuts on depositors in Cyprus means that deposits in any peripheral euro zone bank that may face a restructuring in the future are no longer safe (and bank stocks have tumbled accordingly in recent weeks). Why would euro zone leaders let that happen? In reality, it looks like policymakers are once again simply doing whatever they can to avoid contagion, and the hedge funds, by betting on this â€“ same as ever â€“ got it right again. Hence, the move to hit depositors in Cyprus may signal less of a shift in EU policymaking strategy than it does a continuation of the avoidance-of-contagion-at-all-costs strategy. The report from IFR's Harrison and Geddie lends credence to this idea (emphasis added): "There is a calculated gamble here that the contagion from deposit holders is less important than the contagion you would see if the Troika forced [private sector involvement] in a second European country," said a portfolio manager at a large European fixed income fund. So, while the EU did force private sector involvement in the restructuring of Cypriot banks, they did it to avoid such an outcome in the restructuring of Cypriot sovereign debt. If they had done otherwise â€“ loaning the entire amount of the money needed for the bailout to Cyprus, thus raising the tiny country's public debt-to-GDP to "unsustainable" levels that increase the odds for the need to bail out the government in the future â€“ they would have sent a different message to investors. For euro zone leaders, that could have been an even bigger headache.
Wikimedia CommonsIain Duncan Smith, currently the Work and Pensions Secretary in the British government and former leader of the Conservative Party, has raised some eyebrows by saying he could live on Â£53 ($80.60) a week. That's just Â£7.57 ($11.50) a day. According to the Telegraph, Duncan Smith said he would live on the sum â€” the lowest rate of jobseeker's allowance given to adults under 25 â€” if he "had to". The MP made the claim in an interview withÂ BBC Radio 4's Today program, where he was attempting to justify cuts to welfare payments imposed by the Conservative Government. These cuts, which went into practice today, are part of wider austerity measures that are proving especially controversial in the country. Duncan Smith's own finances are being looked at sceptically since he made the comment. The Telegraph notes that he earns Â£1,581.02 ($2401) a week at present â€” Â£225 ($342.79) a day after tax â€” and that he married "into a family of multi-millionaires", while Alex Hern at the New Statesman points towards expense reports that show Duncan Smith once spent Â£12.42 ($18.86) on a USB cable. Online, the response has mostly been incredulous: When Iain Duncan Smith starts living on Â£53 a week there will be a webcam, right? Iain Duncan Smith thinks you could live on Â£53 a week if he "had to". Lost. For. Words. I almost expected Iain Duncan Smith to add "APRIL FOOL!" after saying he could live on Â£53 a week. Sadly not.
via Street EasyLast week, it was reported that Jefferies CEO Richard Handler is trying to stop the construction of a Tribeca roof top deck that would block his panoramic views from his apartment.  Handler, who was awarded $58 million, including his 2012 compensation and future incentives, filed a petition in Manhattan Supreme Court claiming the planned roof deck at 50 Varick Street would obstruct his river views from his penthouse at 1 York Street, according to DNAInfo.  We were able to track down photos of Handler's apartment and the views are jaw dropping. 
Wikimedia CommonsLast week was a bad one for oil infrastructure. On Wednesday, three train cars carrying oil through Minnesota leaked or spilled between 20,000 to 30,000 gallons of crude oil. Then Friday evening, a pipeline malfunction in Arkansas forced hundreds of residents to evacuate and left oil "running down the road like a river." Some environmentalists are using these incidents to argue the dangers of transporting large amounts of fuel.  However, the data shows that spills happen in greater volumes when smaller amounts of oil are being moved. Look at this table from Dr. Dagmar Etkin of Environmental Research Consulting showing gallons spilled into inland waterways per billion gallons transported. Neither rail nor pipelines is No. 1. Dr. Dagmar Etkin/Environmental Research Consulting Instead, plain old road transport is the greatest culprit for spills — 37 gallons for every billion gallons transported. It's possible these numbers are now outdated (they're from 1980 to 2003). But based on this data, it seems to be a mistake to assume that spills can be reduced by just transporting smaller amounts of it at a time.

Bloomberg TelevisionThe S&amp;P 500 hit an all-time closing high on the last trading day of the first quarter. The Dow meanwhile, had set a few record highs in the first quarter. All this bullishness has prompted many Wall Street analysts to raise their year-end S&amp;P 500 price targets. Though of course, some warn that stock prices will tumble in the next two quarters. In a new note, Gluskin Sheff's David Rosenberg that it is "exciting" to see the S&amp;P 500 hit an all-time high, but that "beneath the veneer, some signs of 'nonratification' or at least 'overbought' readings are starting to take hold."

Daniel Goodman / Business InsiderThe New Yorker has a profile of Business Insider Editor-In-Chief/CEO/Founder Henry Blodget written by the legendary Ken Auletta. Auletta's biographical chops are really on display here, as he coaxes out details of Henry that many of us in the office have never heard before. So here are five things I just learned about my boss. Henry used to be an avid chess player (which is odd, since I used to play chess avidly, and yet we've never played): At Yale, Blodget was a history major and, he said, â€œa loner.â€ Leigh Raymond, who teaches political science at Purdue University, was Henryâ€™s roommate during their four years at Yale. When they met, Raymond, who had attended public school in Rochester, N.Y., was struck by Blodgetâ€™s self-assurance and range: Blodget played tennis, chess, and Frisbee, rock-climbed, sang a cappella, and was practicing for a pilotâ€™s license. Blodgetâ€™s aplomb â€œintimidated people,â€ Raymond recalled; some students considered him aloof, because â€œhe was not a big person for small talk.â€ Henry is interested in undoing his ban from Wall Street at some point. He told Auletta: â€œ... ten years ago, I got what amounted to a dishonorable discharge from the industry, and Iâ€™ve always been ashamed of that. At some point, if it seems appropriate, I would like to explore the possibility of being reinstated.â€ Henry is a nationally ranked tennis player: A few years ago, Blodget and his father were ranked nationally as doubles partners in the Super-Senior Father/Son Tournament. Henry wrote a 600 page memoir about being a teacher in Japan (it never got published): Blodget spent a year teaching English in Japan, in a rural community several hours west of Osaka. Afterward, he moved to San Francisco and again roomed with Raymond, who had a job in the city. Blodget was a good enough tennis player to become an instructor. At night, he worked on a 600 page memoir about his year in Japan. Henry held some seriously low level journalism jobs: When he couldnâ€™t get his book published, Blodget moved to New York. He took a series of junior editorial jobs: as a fact-checker at the National Audubon Society, a proofreader at Harperâ€™s, a reporter at a small newspaper in Massachusetts, and a reporter on the business news desk at CNN, which ignited his interest in business.

Bitoin Charts Â  If you're like most people, you have probably been hearing a lot about "Bitcoin" recently. And, if you're like most people, you probably do not know what it is or what the fuss is all about. Here's a snapshot. Bitcoin is an electronic currency--a new form of money. It's also, possibly, the next great asset bubble. (Or investment, depending on how the story ends. Or both, depending on when you get in and get out.) Bitcoins take the form of strings of numbers that can be electronically owned by and transferred among individuals and organizations. For now, the currency is primarily used for payments by fringe retailers or illegal transactions, but it is being accepted more and more widely. And organizations that exchange Bitcoins for standard currency are now being approved to operate as banks. The premise and promise of Bitcoin--the part that appeals to folks who don't happen to be gold bugs, conspiracy theorists, or cryptography geeks (obviously they all love it)--is that the current plan is for only a finite number of Bitcoins to be created. This is in direct contrast to standard government-issued currencies, which governments can always print more of. If the supply of Bitcoins remains finite, this should theoretically eliminate inflation, which is one of the biggest drawbacks of paper money. (Although inflation has remained low in recent years, it ravages the value of paper money over time. A dollar in 1900 is only worth about $0.04 in today's currency.) So Bitcoin is conceptually very interesting, especially since it is not issued by a government agency. (Here's a great presentation on what Bitcoin is and why some people are so excited about it.) What has suddenly grabbed the public's attention about Bitcoin, however, is the recent explosion in the value of the currency. Because the number of Bitcoins is limited, their value increases rapidly when more people want them. And when the value of something increases rapidly, even more people want them. So the initial price increases fuel future price increases which fuel more future price increases...at least for a while. Of course, this dynamic has fueled the inflation of every asset bubble in history. So it behooves people to analyze the sustainability of such price increases carefully. When Bitcoin was launched in 2010, the currency initially had very little value. Quickly, however, the price of each "coin" soared above $25, making the initial Bitcoin believers rich. Then prices collapsed, with coins trading down to $5 again. And then Bitcoin prices began a slow and steady rise that has suddenly gone parabolic. At the beginning of March, Bitcoins could be exchanged for about $35. Now they're changing hands at $90. This explosive price increase has many intelligent people crying "bubble!" And these intelligent people may well be right. But if there's one lesson that gets repeated again and again in bubbles, it's that prices can rise much higher and bubbles can last much longer than most observers think. (Internet stocks, for example, were first described as a "bubble" in 1995, a full five years before the peak. And the amount of money made in those next five years made everyone who was skeptical early on look and feel like a fool. House prices, meanwhile, were described as a "bubble" as early as 2002 and 2003. And it wasn't until 2007, many years later, that house prices finally peaked.) Driving prices in all bubbles, of course, is the possibility that the price action might not actually be a bubble. And that applies to Bitcoin, too. If Bitcoins become an accepted currency everywhere in the world, if governments don't intervene and make Bitcoin transactions illegal, and if the supply of Bitcoins remains finite (if the systems aren't hacked or the anonymous creators don't get greedy and decide to create many more). then Bitcoin prices could go much, much higher. After all, how much would you pay for a currency that could be used everywhere in the world and would never demolish your savings by losing value to inflation? You might pay a lot for that currency. And, as with any asset, it would be hard if not impossible to determine how much value was "too much"--because determining the value of any asset or means of exchange is always a subjective exercise. At the same time, though, there are many big risks that could bring the Bitcoin frenzy to a quick and brutal end. Governments, for example, might decide that Bitcoin undermines the value of their own legal currencies--and ban it. In the U.S., only Congress has the power to print money, and Congress might well decide that Bitcoin is money (which, it is). Or, Bitcoin's technology could be hacked, allowing Bitcoins to be stolen from their owners. Or someone could make counterfeit Bitcoins. Or the anonymous creators of Bitcoin could decide to create a lot more, thus debasing the value of each unit of the currency. Or Bitcoin could never really gain mass-market acceptance. In short, there are lots of reasons why Bitcoin might not be the wonderful "store of value" that Bitcoin fanatics and investors say it is--and, instead, might just become the next tulip bulb or dotcom stock bubble. On the other hand... Bitcoin might fulfill its promise. And/or Bitcoin might make some speculators fantastic amounts of money in the hours, days, months, or years before its value crashes. So you can understand why not just monetary theorists and technology folks and speculators are excited about it. (Pssst... while I was writing this article, the value of a Bitcoin just soared above $100 for the first time.Â You missed a ~10% gain just this morning!)
On Thursday, the S&amp;P 500 closed at an all-time high. However, the most remarkable aspect of this achievement may be that it got there with very few notable pullbacks. "It’s been 90 trading days since the last 5%+ dip and 374 days since a correction," writes Deutsche Bank's David Bianco in a new note to clients. So, does this mean we're overdue for a sell-off? Not necessarily, says Bianco. "Dips of 5%+ are inevitable, but they don’t happen in absence of bad news or emerging risk," he writes. "Since 1960, the average number of trading days in-between 5%+ dips is 118 and in- between 10%+ corrections is 357 days. The [standard deviation] is 92 and 387 days, respectively. "Hence, pullbacks aren’t clockwork. Dips come on disappointment, which raises uncertainty that requires reassessment at the time – dips aren’t free. Only 3 years since 1960 without a 5%+ dip from 6mo high: 1964, 1993, &amp; 1995." Here's a chart showing the longest periods between dips and corrections.  We're right around average now.

The price of a bitcoin -- the uber-buzzy digital currency -- is surging. A few weeks ago it was at $40. This morning the price of a Bitcoin hit $100. It's now over $104, as this pretty chart from Clarkmoody.com shows. Clarkmoody.com All of this is stoking an incredible amount of interest in the currency. The media is obsessed. Businessweek recently wondered whether Bitcoin was the last safehaven. But there's a downside to this. The Bitcoin economy is now in a terrible state of hyperdeflation. You know what Hyperinflation is, it's when prices surge. Hyperdeflation is when prices violently collapse. So a few weeks ago, a pizza might have cost you one Bitcoin. Today it might only cost you a fifth of a Bitcoin, which sounds great, but then if you're looking at the above chart, why would you spend anything? Why would you buy a pizza (or pot or anything else) when tomorrow your Bitcoin will be worth more? With this kind of chart, you'd be insane to do anything but horde your coins. So yes, all the hype is great for some folks in the ecosystem, but ultimately there's a reason that over time, government prefer to see their currency slowly depreciate. A surging currency leads to hoarding which kills real transactions.
Last week I had a two million dollar deal fall through. Meaning, two million dollars would go to me if the deal had happened. This seems like a â€œfirst world problemâ€ and of course it is. But it sucks to not get two million dollars. I was disappointed for about five minutes. Not because two million isnâ€™t a lot. But what am I going to do â€“ ruin my day because of it? Cry like a little baby? You know why? Because 99% of deals donâ€™t happen. A few weeks ago, on another deal, I thought a company I had invested in was going to IPO. Well, they didnâ€™t. I wouldâ€™ve made a decent amount of money. Maybe they will IPO at some later date. They cure cancer. Why shouldnâ€™t they IPO? Then another investment I made looks like it might be getting sold. I thought I was going to make $X. It turns out Iâ€™m going to make $X divided by three. It turns out Iâ€™m going to make $X divided by three in 2015. Or 2017. Maybe. Who knows? 99% of deals donâ€™t go through. 99% of dreams stay in the sleep world. 99% of the things you hope for and plan your life around force you to change plans. You have to accept changing plans. On this two million dollar deal, not only is it over, but most of the people involved arenâ€™t even calling me back. They are embarrassed or something. Thatâ€™s also the nature of most deals. They donâ€™t call back. People who have been friends for 13 years. Landscapes of your life, shift. Whatever. Donâ€™t call me back. In the past year I probably had 30 or 40 different deals not go through. And this isnâ€™t just random things like, â€œOh, buy this lottery ticket, it might be worth $500 millionâ€. These are all deals that I was in some way actively involved in. Iâ€™ll tell you the biggest deal I thought about doing. A friend of mine had a clever idea about how he could buy AOL. He found something about AOL that nobody else noticed. I tried to help him out. It didnâ€™t work. Thatâ€™s a big thing â€“ to buy AOL. We couldnâ€™t make that deal work no matter what. I donâ€™t count that in the list of 40 deals that didnâ€™t go through. It was too far fetched. Donâ€™t go crazy with your deals! Ok, I wonâ€™t. Donâ€™t do it! Ok. When I was 19 I wrote a chess program using an idea called â€œconspiracy theoryâ€. The idea was: if too many things had to conspire to make a move good, then the move is no good. For instance, if I lose my queen for a pawn, then pretty much all of my opponentâ€™s possible responses had to result in checkmate for me. In other words, all of my opponentâ€™s moves had to conspire together to make it work out for me. It had a big conspiracy number. So the move was probably not good. Donâ€™t lose the most powerful piece on the board! Your beautiful, sexy queen. I use conspiracy theory now for almost everything in life. If someone calls me and says, â€œI have this great idea to buy AOL.â€ Then my gut will tell me that the conspiracy number is too high and I wonâ€™t do the deal. Raising the money, getting through the mechanics of buying a public company, convincing people not to screw us out of the middle, putting together the business plan, finding people who wouldnâ€™t think we were crazy â€“ all of these had to conspire together. Not to mention the time it would take. My time is worth BILLIONS. The other day a friend of mine needed help with a business he had. No problem. I thought of someone I could introduce him to. I made the call and said, â€œdo you want to be introduced to this guy who has this problem.â€ The guy said, â€œYesâ€. Conspiracy number of one. I made the intro. If something good happens, then it will be good for me. Even with a low conspiracy number, 99% of everything wonâ€™t work out. The girl who smiles at you. The book editor who loves your book. The boss who wants to promote you. The good meal you want to cook. The college you want to go to. The career you want to have. The award you want to win. The recognition you know you deserve. Ugh, donâ€™t be such a downer, James. Why donâ€™t you have a Positive Mental Attitude? PMA! Donâ€™t worry about me. PMA also means, Prepare, Make it Happen, Accept the outcome. If you can do that over and over, you find love. Youâ€™ll be happy. Itâ€™s all just a game. If you bet on any one move, then you lose the game. You know the one trick? The trick is to breathe. Are you breathing? Then everything that you NEED to be working out is already working out. Â And then you make the next move in the game. Now come over here and kiss me.
Corn prices immediately collapsedÂ last night as soon as trading opened, following a bearish USDA report Thursday saying stocks were higher than anticipated. Â  This morning, the freefall is continuing. May prices were down as much as 5.58 percent. Here's the chart: Investing.com Morgan Stanley commodities guru Adam Longson says the decline could and should have been even worse if not for CME circuit breakers. However, he puts forward a reason why bulls shouldn't flee: export demand. Export parity should still cushion falling old-crop corn prices. While we would not be surprised to see old-crop corn prices sell off further, the US balance will remain tight until the new harvest â€” with Thursdayâ€™s miss masking the fact that Mar 1 stocks were still down 10% YoY. A pullback in US prices below $6.40/bu would leave US exports competitive again against Argentina, resulting in an unsustainable up-tick in US demand. We'd also note that a recent NOAA report says weather should be returning to normal in large swaths of corn country after last year's devastating drought.

APJERUSALEM (AP) — Recent discoveries of massive offshore natural gas deposits, set to begin flowing in the coming days, are turning into a mixed blessing for Israel. The deposits are expected to provide Israel enough natural gas for decades and transform the country, famously empty of natural resources, into an energy exporter. Yet selling this gas overseas will require Israel to navigate a geo-political quagmire that risks angering allies and enemies alike. Amid this uncertainty, Israel still has not formulated an export policy. "Instead of being an ingredient which serves to calm the tensions of the eastern Mediterranean, (the discoveries) provide instead another impetus for rivalry," said Simon Henderson, a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. "There is a reason this is often called diplomatically trapped gas." Israel discovered two large fields, Tamar and the heftier Leviathan, in 2009 and 2010. Tamar, which holds an estimated 8.5 trillion cubic feet, is set to begin pumping to the Israeli market in the coming days, while Leviathan, which boasts an estimated 16 to 18 trillion cubic feet of gas, is expected to go online in 2016, the approximate time when exports are expected to begin. The discoveries are just a portion of the huge reserves in the Levant Basin, which the United States Geological Survey estimated in 2010 holds some 122 trillion cubic feet of recoverable natural gas. While Israel's finds are minimal compared to gas giants Russia, Iran or Qatar, they are more than enough for the country's domestic needs and would enable the country to reduce its reliance on costlier and dirtier oil and coal. Nearby Cyprus has also become newly resource-rich, and Israel's other neighbors, including enemies, may discover their own deposits. In all, Israel has just the world's 46th largest supply of proven natural gas reserves, according to the CIA Factbook. But the country's proximity to Middle Eastern and European markets could make it an important regional player. For oil companies hoping to profit from the new wealth, the biggest hurdle remains the lack of an export policy. "The challenge we face now is ... the failure to decide on export," said Bini Zomer, an official in Israel with Noble Energy, the Texas-based company that has led exploration efforts. "The policymakers seem to lack a sense of urgency." The challenges are many. Cooperating with Cyprus risks antagonizing Turkey, an important one-time ally whose relations with Israel have greatly cooled in recent years. The neighboring Arab countries Egypt and Jordan might provide opportunity, albeit with some political risk. Europe is a potentially larger and more stable market, but reaching the continent is a logistical challenge and risks angering Russia. Israel has already broached volatile turf by opening talks with Cyprus. The two countries, whose territorial waters border each other, are looking into how best to jointly exploit their mineral reserves. One option is to pipe the gas to Cyprus, where it could be processed for export to Europe and beyond. The gas discoveries have helped to warm historically chilly ties with Cyprus, which has traditionally sided with the Palestinians and has looked on warily as Israel built military and trade relations with rival Turkey. Israel's ties with Ankara deteriorated dramatically over the past three years since an Israeli naval raid on a Gaza-bound flotilla killed nine Turkish activists. The cooperation with Cyprus has further angered Turkey, which has claimed some of Cyprus' offshore supplies as its own. Israel and Turkey announced last week that they were restoring full diplomatic relations after Israel apologized for the flotilla deaths. But relations remain cool and it remains unclear how Israel's links to Cyprus will shape up. The Israel-Turkey rapprochement is on the minds of Cypriot authorities as future gas revenues are seen as the country's best hope to pull it out of the economic morass that has decimated its banking sector. "I assure you that we are monitoring the situation and we will act accordingly to protect the country's sovereign rights," Cyprus' Commerce Minister Giorgos Lakkotrypis recently said. He said the country's president, Nicos Anastasiades, is planning a trip to Israel to discuss energy cooperation matters. Cyprus has looked to Israel to pool their respective gas finds in order to build a gas processing facility on the island that could be used to supply domestic demand and liquefy it for export. Experts say the most obvious route to Europe from Israel would be through Cyprus, then to Turkey, but those traditional enmities could block such a solution. Cyprus fears that Israel may instead opt to sign a deal to pipe its excess gas to Turkey directly via a pipeline in order to reach European markets. Brenda Shaffer, an expert on natural gas at Israel's Haifa University, noted that the renewed alliance opens the door to cooperation with Turkey, a large market and rising player on the global stage. "Cyprus can never replace Turkey in terms of geopolitical value for Israel," she said. Meanwhile, entering the European market risks placing Israel at odds with Russia, a natural gas juggernaut that supplies much of Europe. Russian energy giant Gazprom has shown interest in working with the consortium drilling off Israel's coast, which observers say may reflect a desire to ensure a role in the region's gas projects. There are more challenges closer to home. The maritime border between enemies Lebanon and Israel is disputed. Although it appears no major gas sits in the contentious area, tensions have flared over the disagreement. The Hezbollah militant group, which battled Israel to a stalemate during a monthlong war in 2006, has threatened to use force to protect what it says is Lebanon's natural wealth. Any infrastructure Israel builds is vulnerable to attacks from the myriad militant groups in Egypt, the Gaza Strip and Lebanon. Sending gas to a processing plant in Egypt, one of the many ideas floated, is contingent upon whether the tenuous peace agreement between Israel and Egypt remains intact. Egypt's own gas exports to Israel have ground to a halt following more than a dozen pipeline attacks by militants in Egypt's Sinai desert. But some opportunities are at hand. No longer reliant on Egypt, Israel will have a stable source of energy, along with a chance to strengthen ties with its neighbors by providing clean energy that is cheaper than oil. An official from Israel's Energy Ministry said the government has "an interest" in providing energy to Jordan and the Palestinians. He spoke on condition of anonymity because the government has not made any firm decisions. Jordan, in particular, makes sense for Israel. Jordan signed a peace agreement with Israel in 1994, and new commercial ties would help cement that peace. Jordan, which has also seen its gas supplies disrupted by the repeated pipeline attacks in Egypt, would also benefit from a stable source of energy. These disruptions from Egypt have forced Jordan to use oil to fuel its electric plants. A Jordanian government official said Jordan would be interested in Israeli gas "if it's cheap." He spoke on condition of anonymity because no decisions have been made. Although Israel has a head start, it has yet to determine how much of its gas will be sold abroad, how to ship it overseas and which markets it may serve. A 2012 inter-ministerial report recommended that Israel preserve enough gas for itself for a 25-year period, leaving just over half of its estimated reserves for potential export. Those recommendations have yet to be adopted, and for now, only deals with Israel's national electricity provider and other local industry are in place. Once it does forge its export policy, Israel will look to strike a balance between diplomacy and commercial viability. "Gas is always very political," said Shaffer. "The politics have to support the commercial interests, but if the commercial interests aren't there, the politics aren't enough." ___ Associated Press writers Menelaos Hadjicostis in Nicosia, Cyprus, Dale Gavlak in Amman, Jordan, and Bassem Mroue in Beirut contributed to this report. ___ Follow Tia Goldenberg on Twitter at http://twitter.com/tgoldenberg Copyright (2013) Associated Press.

AP ImagesPlease see my earlier post on The Humble IRA. Does the humble and homely Individual Retirement Arrangement (IRA) matter to well-paid people? I remember being shocked in the late 1990s when my mentor Jim on the bond trading floor at Goldman declared “I don’t bother with IRAs because nobody’s getting rich investing through an IRA.” I eagerly sought out wisdom on personal finance at the time, so I was struck that such a clear tax-advantaged vehicle could be overlooked by a financially savvy professional like Jim. He was a Vice President at the time and made a good salary and bonus, with bright prospects.  He then became a partner about 6 years later, wholly and thoroughly justifying his scorn for the lowly IRA as a wealth-building vehicle. His example stuck in my head over the years because – more than the stark irrelevance of an IRA for his own personal situation – I’ve realized that he’s basically right – upper income and wealthy people as a whole really have no use for the IRA.  It’s a waste of time for them.  This is true for a number of reasons. 1. The maximum tax deductibility limit of $5,000 doesn’t get you very far if you have many multiples of that amount to invest.  In the 1990s, when my mentor made his scornful statement about not getting rich from an IRA, contribution limits were stuck at $2,000 – making his scorn even more justifiable.  But even with the upward adjustment to $5,000 in 2012 and $5,500 in 2013, that still doesn’t provide much tax advantage. 2. Most highly compensated people have access to a 401K or a similar saving plan which offers many times the tax-advantaged contributions of an IRA.  If you own your own business, or if you work for a high-paying salary, you could put away at least $17,000 pre-tax in 2012, in addition to larger amounts through employer profit-sharing, leaving the homely and humble IRA in the dust. 3. If you have access to a much better, bigger employer retirement plan like a 401K, as most highly compensated people do, suddenly you’ve lost the $5,000 IRA tax deductibility if you make more than $68K individually, (or $112K if you file with your spouse.) The end result: my mentor Jim was right.  Upper income people really can’t be bothered with the IRA, and I can’t fault their logic. All of the above is particularly ironic to me because I’ve spent the past month arguing, pleading, berating, and otherwise pestering the undergraduates to whom I teach personal finance into opening and funding their first personal IRA. I’ve taught them about the key building-block concepts of compound interest, and understanding wealth, and how to budget and save money. I’ve argued that opening and funding their first IRA – which I assigned as mandatory homework to them this week – is a key culmination of everything I’ve taught them. And I do believe in the value of the IRA for them in particular, as I assume they will not be highly paid in their first years out of college, nor will many of them have access to a 401K right away.  So an IRA makes a ton of sense for them.  At least for now. What I haven’t told them is that as soon as they’re well-paid and wealthy they can forget all about the IRA, with my financial blessing.  But please don’t let them know this yet. First they have to open the IRA, before they can forget all about it.   Please see the earlier post: The humble IRA and related posts on the personal IRA: A IRA rebuttal: The curious case of Mitt Romney The magic trick of the Roth IRA – inter- generational wealth transfer The DIY movement comes to the IRA
en.wikipedia.orgPrinceton doesn't want you.Tough break, kid. The letter arrived on Friday informing you that you did not get accepted to Yale, Harvard, or Duke, or whatever school you dreamed of attending. Like Suzy Lee Weiss, who wrote a letterÂ in the Wall Street Journal to all of the colleges that rejected her, you are realizing that "being yourself" was not an effective way to get ahead, especially if yourself is a median American.Â Indeed, that may have been the worst advice you ever received. An ex-Dartmouth admissions officer we spoke to in the fall put it bluntly: "Not standing out is a big mistake for kids who are from demographic groups that are historically well-represented." Dartmouth (at least until recently) rates applicants out of ten for academic qualities and personal qualities, which take into account things like socio-economic background. A poor black kid who scores a 7 academically would also get a high personal score for outperforming his peers.Â For a wealthy white kid from the suburbs, however, a 7 for academics "might not mean much in their personal context." "You want toÂ find a kid who stands out given what they've been given," our source says. Affluent white kids really do need to start charities, edit newspapers, get internships, or do the various other things that Weiss mocks in her letter to the Journal. What's more, they have to present these extracurricular activities in a meaningful way. "The essay is very important," our source says. "It's when you get a sense of what the kid is about. We're looking for creativity, self-awareness. The biggest mistake is when they aren't very self-aware and write standard sports essay where they talk about the big game and that hurts them in the end." Asians may have trouble standing out too, with so manyÂ tiger cubsÂ excelling in high school. "When reading recommendations [for Asian kids] you see these words â€” 'diligent,' 'hardworking' ... you rarely see 'creative' or 'strong intellectual bent,' and they are less likely to be seen as 'freethinking,'" our source says. Applicants need to understand how they fit into the admissions officer's rubric and how they can stand out. They need to play the college game harder and smarter and for longer. They need to break free of the quaint American viewpoint that all children are special and should be free to develop in their own special way. If you understood all of this ten years ago, then you probably could have got into your dream school. But don't worry, kid, it's not too late to learn this lesson now. Plan for your future while attending college. We suggest majoring in engineering.

Â  "Every joke was invented down there," a retired NYSE specialist told Business Insider. Â  The thing is the trading humor has subsided in recent years. "Fortunately, or unfortunately, you don't see those pranks anymore," said another veteran trader.Â  He explained that in the past, traders played pranks on the floor to help everyone "blow off steam." Â  "You can't be running at 100 percent all the time," he said. "You need to break the tension and that's why on the floor, every floor, they'd have some sort of prank or joke." Veteran traders both in New York and Chicago from the NYSE, CBOT, NYMEX and AMEX told us about some of the classic pranks and jokes they used to pull back in the day.Â  * If you have another trading floor prank, joke or story you would like to share, please send Julia an email at jlaroche@businessinsider.com.

Flickr / harry_nlThe March ISM manufacturing report is out and it's a miss. The headline number fell to 51.3, down from 54.2 last month. Economists were looking for a reading of 54.0. Any reading above 50 signals expansion. Click Here For Updates &gt; From the ISM: The report was issued today by Bradley J. Holcomb, CPSM, CPSD, chair of the Institute for Supply Managementâ„¢ Manufacturing Business Survey Committee. "The PMIâ„¢ registered 51.3 percent, a decrease of 2.9 percentage points from February's reading of 54.2 percent, indicating expansion in manufacturing for the fourth consecutive month, but at a slower rate. Both the New Orders and Production Indexes reflected growth in March compared to February, albeit at slower rates, registering 51.4 and 52.2 percent, respectively. The Employment Index registered 54.2, an increase of 1.6 percentage points compared to February's reading of 52.6 percent. The Prices Index decreased 7 percentage points to 54.5, and the list of commodities up in price reflected far fewer items than in February. In addition, the Backlog of Orders, Exports and Imports Indexes all grew in March." Of the 18 manufacturing industries, 14 are reporting growth in March in the following order: Wood Products; Furniture &amp; Related Products; Plastics &amp; Rubber Products; Electrical Equipment, Appliances &amp; Components; Fabricated Metal Products; Paper Products; Apparel, Leather &amp; Allied Products; Miscellaneous Manufacturing; Nonmetallic Mineral Products; Computer &amp; Electronic Products; Transportation Equipment; Printing &amp; Related Support Activities; Primary Metals; and Food, Beverage &amp; Tobacco Products. The three industries reporting contraction in March are: Petroleum &amp; Coal Products; Chemical Products; and Machinery. Here's a breakdown of the subcomponents: ISM Earlier this morning, we learned that the Markit U.S. PMI slipped to 54.6 from 54.9 last month. This came in the wake of a slew of Asian PMI reports, that all signaled acceleration.

Flickr / AlicePopkornAtlasHEADS UP: The world's biggest economies are releasing their March manufacturing PMI reports Sunday through Tuesday. And this is our scorecard. So far, the reports reflect acceleration in Asia's manufacturing sector. China's official manufacturing PMI report climbed to 50.9 in March, down from 50.1.Â  Economists where expecting a reading of 52.0. Last month, some weak economic numbers had some China watchers wondering if the world's second largest economy may be heading for a hard landing.Â  An increasing PMI should quell some of those concerns. Europe, meanwhile, continues to be a mess, and all signs suggest its economies deteriorated in March. In the U.S., where economic numbers have been so strong, manufacturing appears to have decelerated a bit. Still, the numbers point toward growth. PMI At the beginning of each month, Markit, HSBC, RBC, JP Morgan and several other major data gathering institutions publish the latest local readings of the manufacturingÂ purchasing managers index (PMI) for countries around the world. PMI is one of the best leading indicators of the economy.Â  Each reading is based on surveys of hundreds of companies. Read more about it at Markit. These are not the most closely followed data points.Â  However, the power of the insights is unparalleled. Jim O'Neill, Chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, believes the PMI numbers are among the most reliable economic indicators in the world.Â  BlackRock's Russ Koesterich thinks it's one of the most underrated indicators. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- March 28 (All Times EST) March 31, April 1 April 1, 2

Keith Allison via FlickrIt turns out a pair of Goldman Sachs executives helped iron out the terms of the 2007 deal between Alex Rodriguez and the Yankees, the New York Times reported. Back in 2007, A-Rod, a star third baseman, opted out of his first contract with the Yankees, which was the richest contract in baseball history. That news broke when the Boston Red Sox were about to win the World Series and it was a huge ordeal. Rodriguez later said he wanted to stay on with the Yankees and blamed the situation on his agent Scott Boras. He ended up severing ties with Boras. A-Rod got the help of a pair of Goldman execs to smooth things over and work out another contract with the team. It ended up being the richest deal in baseball history.  From the NYTimes:  Rodriguez then enlisted the help of John Mallory, a Goldman Sachs wealth management adviser he knew from Miami. Mallory put Rodriguez in touch with his fellow Goldman Sachs financial adviser Gerald Cardinale, who had done work for the Yankees, and the two financial experts began serving as intermediaries between Rodriguez and the Yankees. Cardinale was the Yankees’ banker. He had worked on lucrative business deals with the team. Mallory and Cardinale got on a Goldman Sachs phone line and called Randy Levine, the Yankees’ team president. Mallory told Levine what Rodriguez had said to Hank Steinbrenner. He said Rodriguez was sorry, was ready to apologize to the Steinbrenners in person and wanted to return to the Yankees. They ended up working out a $275 million 10-year contract, which included a $265 million salary and a $10 million signing bonus.  The deal also included bonuses tied to passing homerun milestones, according to the New York Times.  Since then, A-Rod has had a series of injuries and trails behind Barry Bonds' homerun milestone.  In January, he had surgery on his left hip in and hasn't been to spring training yet, according to the New York Times.   The Yankees, which are reportedly trying to trim their payroll, owe A-Rod $114 million through the end of 2017.  [Hat Tip: @DanDrezner]
APPeak oil is dead. We told you what that will mean for the U.S. economy. But what about the rest of the world? Quartz's Steve LeVine was the first to write why this could spell big trouble for OPEC. We also reported last month that Norway's foreign minister believesÂ America's shale boom could rearrange the Middle East's balance of power.Â  But we wanted to go one step further and hone in on what the end of peak oil means for one of America's all-time frenemies: Saudi Arabia. The kingdom still rules the oil world in every major stat: productionÂ (11.2 million barrels a day), exportsÂ (8.5 million barrels a day), and largest oil deposit (the Ghawar field at an estimated 70 billion barrels). But with the help of some charts from AEI's Mark Perry, who's been chronicling America's energy boom better than anyone, and the now-instant classic note, "The End Is Nigh [for rising oil demand]" from Citi's Seth Kleinman and Ed Morse, we bring you 10 charts that should scare the crude out of the Saudis.
REUTERS/Steven ShU.S. PMI has fallen slightly to 54.6. The previous month was 54.9, and analysts had expected 55.0. So this is a slight miss, but not a huge deal. Remember, in any one of these PMI/ISM-type surveys, a number above 50 is expansion, so the U.S. manufacturing economy is still clearly in expansion territory.
Daniel Goodman/Business InsiderQuick heads up. Two more economic reports are coming out today. From Nomura: US ISM Manufacturing: The ISM manufacturing index increased for a third straight month in February. In March, financial conditions remained supportive, but regional surveys of manufacturing sentiment have been mixed -- the Empire State manufacturing index declined slightly, while the Philly Fed survey entered positive territory for the first time this year. These results lead us to forecast a nearly unchanged reading in the ISM manufacturing index at 54.1 in March from 54.2 in February (10:00 EDT, Consensus: 54.0).Â  US Construction spending: After increasing for most of 2012, construction spending declined by 2.1% m-o-m in January. Consensus expects a month-over-month increase of 1.0% in construction spending in February (10:00 EDT).
Robert McNallyIs Bitcoin the new gold? Some former gold bugs certainly think so. And its value has skyrocketed in recent months. But many readers at this point are probably wondering ... what exactly is Bitcoin? Robert McNally, an iOS developer at parking payment startup QuickPay, gave the following presentation to last year's Hackers' Conference in Santa Cruz, answering exactly that question.Â  With his kind permission, we have republished it here.Â 
APGood morning. Here's what you need to know:
Business InsiderFrom Dave Lutz of Stifel, Nicolaus, here's an ultra-quick guide to what traders are talking about this morning. Morning - Welcome to April Foolâ€™s Day - Overseas Markets are closed â€“ EU, UK, Aussie and Hong Kong.Â  FX Markets are still open in thinner trading - Futures are mixed in the US right now.Â  The Nikkei got hit on a weaker Tankan survey, but optimism is high into this weekâ€™s BOJ meeting.Â  While Shanghai composite was basically unchanged, Chinaâ€™s Property developers rallied as housing measures over the weekend were not asÂ  severe as feared.With no flows from EU, 10Y is reversing last weekâ€™s Pension bid, with Yields up 3bp.Â  The DXY is under pressure, as the Yen has a big to it, and the â‚¬ is trying to rally back toward the 200dma.Â  Most commodities are under pressure tho, due to weaker than expected PMI data in Asia (Specifically China and India) - Copper off 1.4%, despite disruption at Coldecoâ€™s Chile mine.Â  Oil is retreating as well, but seems mostly WTI relative to Brent as the XOM spill threatens increased rhetoric against Keystone XL.
Wikimedia CommonsThe 23-year-old girlfriend of the late Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky said on Monday that she did not believe he had killed himself and that they had been planning to go to Israel on holiday together days after he was found dead. In an interview with liberal weekly New Times, Katerina Sabirova said she did not believe Berezovsky, 67, whom she first met four years ago, would have killed himself, and that in their last conversation a day before his death, his voice "had sounded better than usual." Berezovsky, 67, was found on March 23 in the bathroom of a mansion outside London and a postmortem found that he had been hanged and no evidence of a struggle. "He was definitely planning to come to Israel on Monday (March 25). I know that for sure," she told the magazine and gave them a printout of her air ticket to Tel Aviv. "He had big plans" of going to the Dead Sea, she said, adding that he had been down but that she had not believed he was suicidal. Berezovsky "used to say: 'Imagine if I'm not around, all the problems will go away,' but this wasn't a guide to action, I could not and cannot imagine that he could do this. It's very hard to believe this," Sabirova said. Berezovsky was due to meet her at Tel Aviv airport's VIP lounge, after flying out with his bodyguard Avi, she said. He had proposed the trip on March 18, as Sabirova's British visa had run out. The magazine printed a photograph of Sabirova, a pretty brunette, with Berezovsky, his arm around her shoulder. Friends of Berezovsky confirmed that they were in a long-term relationship, it said. When she came to a Moscow restaurant for the interview "heads turned," the magazine wrote. Sabirova also confirmed that Berezovsky had discussed with her his letter to Putin asking for forgiveness, whose existence was revealed after Berezovsky's death by Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov. "He said that he did not see another way (to return to Russia) than to bow down," she said, adding that she saw a draft and inferred that Berezovsky sent it in November. Friends of Berezovsky concurred that he had been extremely depressed after losing a multi-million-pound court battle against fellow oligarch Roman Abramovich, owner of Chelsea football club, last year.

Kevin Smith/Business InsiderEarly this morning, electric car maker Tesla announced that it is exceeding its previous guidance on auto sales and turning profitable for the quarter. Below the dotted line is the press release. ------------------------------------------------------------ PALO ALTO, CA--(Marketwire - Apr 1, 2013) - Tesla Motors (NASDAQ: TSLA) announced today that sales of its Model S vehicle exceeded the target provided in the mid February shareholder letter. As customers who note their Model S serial number this weekend will realize, vehicle deliveries (sales) exceeded 4,750 units vs. the 4,500 unit prior outlook. As a result, Tesla is amending its Q1 guidance to full profitability, both GAAP and non-GAAP. "I am incredibly proud of the Tesla team for their outstanding work. There have been many car startups over the past several decades, but profitability is what makes a company real. Tesla is here to stay and keep fighting for the electric car revolution," said Elon Musk, Tesla Motors co-founder and CEO. "I would also like to thank our customers for their passionate support of the company and the car. Without them, we would not be here." Also being announced today is that the small battery option for the Model S will not enter production, due to lack of demand. Only four percent of customers chose the 40 kWh battery pack, which is not enough to justify production of that version. Customers are voting with their wallet that they want a car that gives them the freedom to travel long distances when needed. The customers who ordered this option will instead receive the 60 kWh pack, but range will be software limited to 40 kWh. It will still have the improved acceleration and top speed of the bigger pack, so will be a better product than originally ordered, and can be upgraded to the range of the 60 kWh upon request by the original or a future owner. Tesla is also revealing a small Easter egg today: all 60 kWh cars have been and will be built with Supercharger hardware included. Tesla is taking a slight cost risk that ultimately all customers will want to buy the Supercharger upgrade and receive unlimited, free long distance travel for life. Even for those that never drive long distances, this will improve the resale value of their car to people that do.
One of the big stories of the last 6 months has been "Abenomics." This is the moniker given to the economic regime being imposed by Japan's new Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who hopes to revive the country's weak economy via fiscal stimulus, monetary stimulus, and even structural reforms. You can read a complete guide to it here. Anyway, in financial markets Abenomics has been greeted enthusiastically. The Nikkei has been a prime mover. And the belief that the Bank of Japan would finally lower real interest rates significantly was causing the yen to dive (something that exporters have been happy about). But in recent weeks the Nikkei has gone nowhere, and the yen is strengthening again. Check out this chart going back to October of the dollar vs. the yen. It appeared to be making a bee-line to 100, but in recent days the dollar has fallen markedly. FinViz The Nikkei also fell hard last night. It seems that right now there's a gap between what the markets have been anticipating and what the real economy is showing. There are some signs of improvement, but other signs that things are still just meh, such as last night's quarterly "Tankan" report on Japanese manufacturers. The Bank of Japan meets this Wednesday under its new boss, so that will be interesting. But what people will really want to see now is some real world improvement.
Todayâ€™s Dominant Form of Money Versus Bitcoin Anyone who understands the basic tenets ofÂ Monetary RealismÂ know that many things can serve as money and many things DO serve as money. Â After all, anyone can create money, but the trouble is in getting others to accept it. Â And since moneyâ€™s primary purpose is in the means of exchange, just about anything can serve as money as long as it meets that primary purpose. Â The thing is, there arenâ€™t all that many things that meet that need on a broad level. Â For instance, lots of people like to claim that gold is money (which it is), but gold isnâ€™t accepted for payment in many places. Â Therefore, MR says that gold has a low level of moneyness (to better understand the concept of moneyness please see here). Â Gold is money, but itâ€™s just not a very good kind of money. Â Bitcoin is actually very similar. Â If you have Bitcoins you can buy certain things online that only a Bitcoin merchant will allow you to buy. Â These merchants accept Bitcoins as a form of final payment. Â To them, itâ€™s a form of money with a very high level of moneyness. Â But to a company like Wal-Mart a Bitcoin is like a gold bar. Â It doesnâ€™t give you access to anything in their store therefore its moneyness is virtually nil in a Wal-Mart. Â Most retailers around the world view Bitcoins similarly. In the USA, the primary form of money is bank deposits because bank deposits are the form of money that dominate the US payments system. Â The US payments system, which is maintained by private banks, is the primary playing field for the purpose of exchanging goods and services. Â In other words, if you want access to the most convenient and widely accepted form of payment (bank deposits), you need to become a member of the US payments system usually by becoming a bank client. Â This gives you access to credit cards, debit cards, a bank account that allows you to withdraw/deposit cash, etc which allows you to interact on the US payments system. Â Becoming a bank client is kind of like opening a Ticketmaster account so you can obtain access to the means of exchange to gain entry into a theater performance (you just want access to the tickets that give you access to a performance). Â In the case of banking, you open an account in order to gain access to the US payments system so you can access the performance that is the US economy. Â Obtaining Bitcoins is similar in many ways, but very different as Iâ€™ll describe below. Bitcoin is a Truly Endogenous Decentralized Form of Money Bitcoin is very different from bank deposits. Â The US payments system is overseen and regulated by the US government. Â In other words, the government has deemed the US dollar as the unit of account in the USA (in other words, money is denominated in US Dollars in the USA) and the government has given private banks the unique privilege to control and maintain the creation of the bank deposits (denominated in USD) that populate the payments system they operate. Â This system isnâ€™t decentralized (even though itâ€™s controlled primarily by private entities) because it is regulated by the US government. Â Bitcoin, on the other hand, is entirely decentralized, unregulated, etc. Decentralization could be both good and bad for Bitcoin. Â I think thereâ€™s a certain missing element of trust in an online money that has no oversight. Â One of the key ingredients that stabilizes and maintains the US payments system is the backing of laws that enforce and regulate the proper use of bank deposits. Â Banks canâ€™t just issue deposits (loans) without working within the regulatory structure of US government law. Â And the users of bank deposits canâ€™t use this payments system for things that the US government might deem inappropriate. Â When you legally exchange goods and services on the US payments system there is a certain level of trust derived from the fact that you have a legal system protecting your rights to use that system in a particular way. Â In other words, the government helps embed a certain element of trust within the system by ensuring that its users operate within strict guidelines and by providing those users with certain protections against fraud, misuse, etc. Â Itâ€™s by no means perfect (some might even argue the government has too much control over the laws binding the payments system), but having an institutionalized form of money helps to solidify the trust that is one component of its viability. Â Bitcoin has no such integrated legal protections or oversight, which is both liberating, but worrisome in some regards. Bitcoin is also interesting in that it circumvents the banking system. Â In the US banking system money is created as debt in the form of loans which create deposits. Â This means the money supply in the USA is market based (created by banks who compete for the demand for loans), but itâ€™s debt based AND can therefore be costly to utilize. Â In other words, you have to â€œpay to playâ€ within the US payments system. Â By decentralizing their payment system, Bitcoin is able to reduce the costs associated with money. Â Theyâ€™re also able to create money that is not directly tied to debt. Â This is both innovative and liberating. One of the more interesting elements of Bitcoin is its rise as a purely endogenous form of money. Â I often refer to bank money as endogenous in that it is created entirely INSIDE the private sector, but even bank money exists on a centralized system (the US payments system) that is regulated by US government law. Â But Bitcoin is completely decentralized and a purely endogenous form of money. Â So the decentralization creates a form of money that has grown entirely independent of government and its taxes. Â In other words, Bitcoin proves that money can exist ENTIRELY for the private purpose for the means of transaction. This not only shows that money can be entirely endogenous and independent of government, but that it can also grow entirely independent of government taxation. The Bitcoin Money Supply and the K-Percent Rule Bitcoinâ€™s money supply is also automated. Â It kind of reminds me of Milton Friedmanâ€™s k-percent rule to automate the growth of the money supply. Â I wonâ€™t get into the way the Bitcoin money supply is automated because the computer based growth is WAY over my head, but all you really need to know is that itâ€™s not controlled by a central bank or any bank at all. Â  This is a very interesting approach to managing the money supply. Â The innovative thinking and creativity behind this concept should be embraced and explored further as money evolves in the future. Where Does Bitcoin go From Here? Â Â  Bitcoin is an extremely interesting and innovative concept that shows that money can be entirely endogenous and exist entirely independent of government. Â But can it be sustained within our economy without the laws that help bind money as a social construct? Â  Can the element of trust be borne into such a decentralized digital money? Â And more importantly, is this form of decentralized digital money inherently at odds with the existence of a money system and economy whose primary payment system exists on a government regulated and government taxed playing field? Â Call me hopeful, but skeptical. I think the innovation and creativity behind Bitcoin is brilliant. Â Itâ€™s an incredibly cool and forward looking form of money. Â But money is a social construct and within any nation that social construct is designed in such a manner that it serves primarily private purpose, but ALSO public purpose. Â In other words, without a system of taxation attached to that money it is at odds with one of the essential components of money as a social construct. Â After all, it is through taxation that public purpose is generated so a money system that is entirely for private purpose could be seen as being at odds with one of the main purposes of money. Â The US government organizes and institutionalizes money within the government regulated banking system so that it can maintain a private market based money system that has strict oversight and tracking. Â This not only allows for enforcement of rules and regulations, but also helps the government ensure that this money can be used for public purpose. Â A truly decentralized form of money like Bitcoin has no such government attachment allowing for any form of public purpose. I think Bitcoin can continue to exist as a subordinate form of money with a very low level of moneyness, but if Bitcoin were to grow to a point where it becomes a highly competitive form of money, but circumvents the laws, regulations and taxation of a system like the US banking system, my guess is that the US government will make it illegal for merchants to receive Bitcoins for payment. Â And then 100 FBI agents get a few thousand Bitcoins each, buy something from US based Bitcoin merchants and parade them out on national TV for the entire nation to see why Bitcoin acceptance results in a $250,000 fine and 5 years in prison. Â In other words, Bitcoin could very well become a victim of its own success as the US government would never allow another form of money to detract from public purpose due to high levels of monetary competition. Â Of course, I am referring to the US government, but this view would likely be embraced by many governments around the world. So Bitcoin is an interesting and extremely innovative form of money, but probably not a viable form on any grand scale since its inevitable competition with the US banking system will likely render it at odds with the goals of the US government. Â I know the anti-government and anti-banking crowd wonâ€™t like that conclusion, but thatâ€™s how I view it. Â A purely private purpose money is at odds with the formation of money as a social construct that partially serves public purpose as the US banking system does. Hopefully, Bitcoin will continue to exist on a smaller scale so we can see how this de-centralized, electronic, innovative and forward looking form of money evolves. Â There is much to be learned here and I think the US government should proceed with caution regarding any potential clamp down on this money system. Â While we wouldnâ€™t want the Bitcoin money system to detract from public purpose I think it is useful and educational to see how this form of money evolves and takes form over time. Â But I worry that the party could come to an end as soon as the US government recognizes it as a very real threat to the US banking system and the payment system it regulates in the means of public purpose.

APWith stocks hovering around all-time highs, many are wondering if this asset class is the next great bubble ready to burst. But stocks aren't the only things that look frothy. There seems to be a lot of other asset classes that sure look like bubbles. We've compiled the assets analysts now believe are flashing warning signs of over-inflating. If you think we reached peak bubble-calls last spring when Robert ShillerÂ diagnosed a "bubble on bubbles,"Â think again.
REUTERS/Christian Hartmann Happy First Day Of Q2! Are you feeling good? If so, SocGen currency analyst Kit Juckes has just what it takes to get you feeling down. In his morning email to clients he writes: Read Wolfgang Munchau in the FT if you want to start Q2 depressed. I'm pretty sure it isn't an April Fool's 'joke' piece, butÂ  'it is logically irrational for a Spanish saver to keep even small amounts in the Spanish banking system' and 'for Spain too, it will become economically rational to leave the eurozone' is pretty aggressive even for Mr Munchau. Also he recommends David Stockman's NYT op-ed about how everything is a debt-fueled bubble, and going to collapse in a smoldering heap. Says Juckes: So there we go. In the U.S., we have an unsustainable money-fluffed recovery; in the U.K. we have a Sheriff of Nottingham style attack on the poor; in Europe we have respected journos arguing for deposit flight. But in Asia Â this morning, and with the exception of India, we have decent PMIs and an on-going economic recovery. That's all a good overview of the economy right now, and how people feel about it as we start the new quarter. Europe is misery. The U.K. is being run by fools. Asia is fine. The U.S. is strong, but something has to give. In truth, the gloomy David Stockmans of the world are a good sign. There's still a deep well of residual hate for the U.S. recovery and stock market comeback. We wouldn't like to see everyone on board.
A really ugly Greek PMI number for March. Here's the quick summary from Markit: Markit
Guwashi999 via www.flickr.com creative commonsIt's fairly quiet this morning, since much of Europe still has off for Easter. However it was a fairly ugly session in Asia, with Japan falling over 2%. The culprit: A bad "Tankan" manufacturing report, which is leading to the idea that "Abenomics" is still not revving up the domestic economy. China and Korea were also both down on the day. US futures are down a bit. And things are quiet in the currency market, with the exception that the yen is pretty strong. It's a big day for economic data, as global PMIs are coming out. See full coverage here.
Japan's stock market has closed, and it was an ugly day to start the week. The Nikkei dropped 2.1 percent. Earlier, we learned from the Tankan survey that pessimism was receding among Japan's largest companies.Â  Still, the report was not as strong as economists were expecting. Here's the intraday chart via Bloomberg: Bloomberg
