SEC To Suspend Advisor Registration In The Event Of A Government Shutdown (SEC)  If the Congress fails to arrive at a budget deal soon, we could see a partial government shutdown. In light of that, the SEC has announced that it will remain "open and operational" in the event of a shutdown. But in its summary of major functions that will be discontinued, the SEC said that  review of registrations by "investment advisers, broker-dealers, transfer agents, nationally recognized statistical rating organizations, investment companies, and municipal advisors" will be suspended.  The SEC also said that "review and approval of self-regulatory organization rule changes; review and acceleration of effectiveness of registration statements by issuers for securities offerings; review of periodic reports and other filings; and non-emergency support to registrants," will be discontinued. Advisors Have Increasingly Been Turning To Technical Analysis Since The Financial Crisis (The Wall Street Journal) Since the financial crisis, portfolio managers have increasingly turned from looking at a company's fundamentals, to technical analysis, in which one examines a stock's price momentum against market moves, reports the Wall Street Journal. Cerulli Associates found that before the crisis, "an overwhelming number of advisers relied on strategic-focused allocations--the hallmark of fundamental analysis," writes Murray Coleman at the WSJ. But by the end of 2011, "tactical portfolio management was being implemented in about 61% of adviser-led portfolio." "Fundamental analysis still works, but there's so much real-time news and commentary available these days that markets have become more short-term in nature," Clifford Brott of Dallas-based Capital Ideas told the WSJ. "To keep up, you've got to be a little more technical in your analysis."  Investors Dump Equities And Pile Back Into Bonds (BofA)  The Fed's decision to delay tapering its $85 billion monthly asset purchase program saw investors pile $4.5 billion into bond funds. This was the largest weekly inflow in five months. Meanwhile, equity funds saw $1.5 billion in outflows. U.S. equity funds were especially hard hit, losing $7.4 billion, but investors poured $2.3 billion into European equities. Here Are The 3 Reasons Why I Think Stocks Will Soar Into The End Of The Year (JP Morgan) JP Morgan's chief U.S. equity strategist Tom Lee has a year-end S&amp;P 500 price target of 1,775. He argues that the Fed's decision to delay tapering its quantitative easing program should be enough to support stocks till the end of the year. This is for three key reasons.  1. Foremost, the recent move to all-time highs is quite constructive for the S&amp;P 500. Only in 3 prior cases did the S&amp;P 500 "sustainably pass multi-decade highs." And in each of those cases "equity markets continued to advance for 5-15 years and increase another 136%- 314%." 2. Valuations are still "supportive." 3. Economic momentum is picking up in the U.S. and Europe and "cyclical stocks are demonstrating leadership." This looks constructive for the market.
AP Estonia, the tiny Baltic state that holds fewer people than San Diego, has been praised recently for both the apparent success of the country's austerity policies (and President Toomas Hendrik Ilves' very public defense of it against Paul Krugman) and the country's remarkable emergence as an Eastern Europe technology hub. Speaking at the Concordia Summit at New York's Grand Hyatt Hotel on Friday, Ilves was on hand to discuss the latter. The feisty, perpetually bow-tied head of state outlined two clear factors in Estonia's technological success — and made a convincing argument that the United States wasn't doing either well. First, let's go over how successful Estonia has been. According to the Economist, the country has the most startups per person, and Skype — programmed by Estonians and funded by Danes and Swedes — became an international success story after it was sold to eBay for $2.6 billion (it was later sold to Microsoft for $8.5 billion). That's a situation that many European countries would like to be in. So how did Estonia — population 1.3 million, GDP per capita $22,100 — do it? Ilves points back to 1991, when Estonia became a sovereign state after 50 years of Moscow-led Communism. The country was, in Ilves words, a "small, dingy, backwards former Soviet republic." The end of Soviet rule, however, provided a blank slate for new infrastructure, Ilves says, and the country was able to capitalize in two ways: 1. Teaching children to code Soon after the end of the Soviet era, Estonia showed remarkable foresight by pushing computer studies in schools. Now the country offers programming lessons to children as early as 1st Grade. Ilves was at this point Estonia's Ambassador to the United States of America and Canada, living in Washington D.C., but he was still able to help, working with education minister Jaak Aaviksoo on the Tiger Leap initiative to computerize and connect all Estonian schools online. Estonia's emphasis on computer studies was a big gamble that would really take fifteen years to pay off, Ilves says. "Basically, if you want to transform a society, you have to start with the young people, and give them the kind of education that will allow them to handle the future," Ilves says. Teaching kids a programming language is actually easier than teaching kids a human language, he adds, as it is "far more logical." The president's interest in computers actually began when he was a teenager living in New Jersey, where, unusually, a teacher taught him to code."This showed me kids can learn how to use computers," Ilves said, though he concedes his own coding skills are uselessly outdated. Except for these rare exceptions and  a handful of Silicon Valley experiments, however, most U.S. schools don't do anything with coding. 2. A government infrastructure that embraces technology With little government infrastructure left after so many decades of Soviet rule, when Estonia moved to create its infrastructure in the 1990s, it decided to skip paper records and go straight to an electronic system. The result of that, Ilves says, 98% of bank transfers are done online and 25% of people now vote online. This has a real effect on the startup world, the Estonian president argues. It takes just fifteen minutes to register a company, he says, with digital signatures and the ability to perform background checks instantly. The system has also helped Estonia escape the corruption that has plagued other similar states. "You can't bribe a computer — it just won't take the envelope." To do this Estonia had to create a very secure Internet, and Ilves asserts that the country has "solved the dilemma of Internet security versus freedom." One example of this is the use of identity cards in the country. These cards include a chip that includes a key pair, which allows the owner of the card to put a secure electronic "signature" on digital documents. The system uses 2048-bit encryption, and Ilves says that even the N.S.A. can't crack it. Again, Ilves feels that the U.S. and the rest of the Anglo-Saxon world falls behind here. He points out how in U.S. online purchases identity is established by using a credit card and a three digit CVC number on the back. "I can't believe you guys do that," he says. "That is not a secure identity." The factors named by Ilves both call for a level of public-private partnership that is unappealing to many Americans. And, of course, Estonia is a very different country than the U.S., and there's a reasonable amount of skepticism that the country's startup boom can continue. It'd be hard to deny there's a logic to Ilves comments, however, and he is a pretty tech-savvy guy himself — just look at how he used Twitter for the now infamous Krugman-spat.
The September Personal Income and Outlays report for August was published today by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The latest Headline PCE price index year-over-year (YoY) rate of 1.15% is a decline from last month's adjusted 1.33%. The Core PCE index of 1.23% is fractionally higher than last month's adjusted 1.13%. As I pointed out last month, the general disinflationary trend in core PCE (the blue line in the charts below) must be troubling to the Fed. After years of ZIRP and waves of QE, this closely watched indicator has consistently moved in the wrong direction since early 2012 and has been flatlining in recent months. advisorperspectives.comThe adjacent thumbnail gives us a close-up of the trend in Core PCE since January 2012. The first chart below shows the monthly year-over-year change in the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index since 2000. I've also included an overlay of the Core PCE (less Food and Energy) price index, which is Fed's preferred indicator for gauging inflation. I've highlighted 2 to 2.5 percent range. Two percent had generally been understood to be the Fed's target for core inflation. However, the December 12 FOMC meeting raised the inflation ceiling to 2.5% for the next year or two while their accommodative measures (low FFR and quantitative easing) are in place. http://advisorperspectives.com/dshort/updates/PCE-Price-Index.php I've calculated the index data to two decimal points to highlight the change more accurately. It may seem trivial to focus such detail on numbers that will be revised again next month (the three previous months are subject to revision and the annual revision reaches back three years). But core PCE is such a key measure of inflation for the Federal Reserve that precision seems warranted. For a long-term perspective, here are the same two metrics spanning five decades. advisorperspectives.com Note: I use the data from Table 9 in the full release and tables available here.Â

AP ImagesAnyone who plays football professionally knows that they won't be able to play forever. That means they need to have post-football career plans in mind. For some, Wall Street is the perfect fit. Â It's cut-throat, super competitive and it takes a lot of discipline to put in all those long hours. So it should come as no surprise that there are a bunch of former football stars working in trading, investment banking and wealth management. We've compiled a list of some of the best football players in finance. (Note: These names are not in any particular order).Â  Many of these guys played professionally before heading to Wall Street. Others were standouts in college. Â Some have even done internships at investment banks during the off-season while still playing in the NFL. If we're missing any big names, feel free to send an email to jlaroche@businessinsider.comÂ to add to the list. A photo would also be greatly appreciated.Â 
Ezra Shaw/Getty ImagesYear after year, Oracle CEO Larry Ellison lands on the lists of the highest-paid paid CEOs.Â  Ellison is the heart and soul of Oracle. He's the cofounder, the visionary, and the longest sitting CEO of a major tech company. His pay reflects that. Even so, by nearly every measure imaginable, his annual compensation is massive, especially considering that Oracle's share price has languished below $40 since the Internet bubble crashed way back in 2000. In 2013, Ellison was paid $78 million in cash and stock, mostly stock, compared to an industry average of $29 million, according to an investment group that wants to draw attention to Ellison's pay. In 2012, it was $96 million, according to Oracle's SEC disclosures, compared to an average of $43 million. And in 2011, it was $76 million, compared to $22 million. Now, activist investment group CtW Investments,Â which owns 6 million shares of Oracle, is calling for an end to it. "The board should tie his compensation to some kind of revenue target or strategic inititiave, not just throw options at him in such a huge amounts," Michael Price Jones, CtW's senior governance analyst told Business Insider. CtW also wants lower pay for Oracle's five other top execs, too. In 2012, for instance, Oracle's top five were paid $253 million, compared to an average of $90 million at other tech companies. If they don't, it wants shareholders to vote them off, CtW argues in a letter to shareholders. It's a long shot. For the most part, shareholder activist protests like this one go no where. CtW argues that it's been on a winning streak lately. It was among the investors who successfully pushed board members to resign at HP and JP Morgan. However, both of those companies had made some huge misteps. Oracle is facing its challenges to grow, but it's still a hugely profitable company with a stranglehold on the enterprise database market. We reached out to Oracle for comment but did not immediately hear back. We'll update this post when we do. Â CtW Investment Group

Obama just gave a speech about the whole debt ceiling and government shutdown fight. And one of the points he made is that the fight isn't actually about the deficit, which has fallen dramatically lately. And that's true, the deficit has fallen dramatically. The GOP response to this is that the only reason the deficit has fallen is because of spending cuts extracted during previous fiscal fights. But this isn't true! And here's the chart to prove it. This chart shows the deficit as a percentage of GDP (red line) vs. the unemployment rate (blue line). Since 1980, the chart is clear: The deficit is a function almost entirely of the economy. When the economy improves, and unemployment goes down, the deficit improves. When the economy worsens, the deficit widens. That's what's made the deficit come down. There's no benefit to the economy or the deficit from getting into fights over the debt ceiling FRED

AP President Barack Obama said that he spoke on the phone Friday with Iranian President Hasan Rouhani, the first such communication between U.S. and Iranian presidents since the 1979 Iranian revolution. Obama spoke at the White House in a news-heavy press conference, where he delivered a statement on foreign policy and budget battles in Congress. Obama said that though the conversation "underscores the deep mistrust between our countries," he was persuaded that there was a path forward on a resolution to Iran's nuclear program. "While there will surely be important obstacles moving forward, I believe that we can reach a comprehensive solution," Obama said. NBC NewsObama's statement came after a speech at the United Nations earlier this week, in which he outlined a pursuit of diplomacy with respect to Iran and its nuclear energy program. Rouhani has spent the past few months making conciliatory statements on its nuclear program, due to economic sanctions that have crippled Iran's economy. After his announcement, Obama quickly pivoted to the budget battles engulfing Congress. The two chambers are battling in debates over keeping the government funded past Sept. 30 and raising the debt ceiling by Oct. 17.  "My message to Congress is this: Do not shut down the government. Don’t shut down the economy. Pass a budget on time. Pay our bills on time," Obama said. The Senate on Friday passed its version of a bill to keep the government funded and avert a government shutdown, the latest move in legislative ping-pong between the two chambers of Congress. The Senate's continuing resolution funds the government through Nov. 15, and it strips language in a House of Representatives "CR" to defund the Affordable Care Act. The final version passed in a 54-44 vote. Obama praised the Senate for "act[ing] responsibily." Now it goes back to the House, where it could face additional changes. If the two chambers can't agree on a compromise before Oct. 1, the government will partially shut down. Obama and the White House have spent much of the past few weeks warning against "self-inflicted wounds" that budget battles could have on the economy. Obama has said he won't sign any bill that defunds Obamacare. On Thursday, White House senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer went so far as to compare House Republicans to suicide bombers, arsonists, and kidnappers taking a hostage. On raising the debt ceiling, Obama took much of the same tone. He suggested that Republican demands on raising the debt ceiling were ridiculous, and he said he would not set the precedent of negotiating with the "full faith and credit" of the United States on the line. "Voting to pay America's bills is not a concession to me. That's not doing me a favor," he said. "Imagine if you had a Republican president and a Democratic speaker, and the Democratic speaker said, 'Well, we’re not going to pass the debt ceiling unless we raise corporate taxes by 40 percent or unless we pass background checks on guns,' or whatever other list of agenda items Democrats were interested in. "Does anybody actually think that we would be hearing from Republicans that that was acceptable behavior? That’s not how our constitutional system is designed. We are not going to do it." In response, Brendan Buck, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, blasted Obama's "grandstanding." "The House will take action that reflects the fundamental fact that Americans don’t want a government shutdown and they don’t want the train wreck that is Obamacare," Buck said. "Grandstanding from the president, who refuses to even be a part of the process, won’t bring Congress any closer to a resolution." A Boehner aide said that Obama has not called Boehner all week.

REUTERS/Carlos BarriaJoe Davidoff, a 29-year old business development manager, and his wife Anna have been house-hunting in Broward County, Florida since April. So far, the couple has made eight bids, and lost out on five. At least four of the five bids they lost were to all-cash bidders. Davidoff and his wife, like many other first-time homebuyers across the country, are being squeezed out by all-cash deals. All-cash purchases accounted for 65% of all residential sales in Florida in August, according to RealtyTrac, and 45% of all U.S. residential sales. The share of institutional investors buying 10 properties or more in the last 12 months increased to 10% of all sales. Davidoff and his wife who have rented in Broward County since 2009, have been looking for homes in Coral Springs, Tamarac, Deerfield Beach, Weston, and Plantation, in Florida's Broward County. After a few disappointments, they expanded their search to cities in Palm Beach County as well. They are looking to spend up to $165,000 on a townhouse or $185,00 on a home. Davidoff doesn't know for sure if the all-cash offers are coming from homebuyers or investors, but the chatter is that its coming from investors. Specifically, he's heard that many of the all-cash offer are from firms in New York, Brazil, and Canada, he told Business Insider in a telephone interview. Davidoff and his wife both went to the University of South Florida, and Davidoff graduated with a Masters degree from Florida International University in 2012. "We both have student loans that limit the amount we can go with," he said. Florida had a median sales price of $132,000 in August, up 15% from a year ago, according to RealtyTrac. The state also had 646,827 annualized residential sales in August, up 22% from a year ago. The couple has been offering $5,000 - $10,000 over the asking price, but they've had a hard time getting contracts accepted. Often, sellers would rather take a lower cash offer to avoid taking on the risk of tighter lending later, he said. RealtyTracThe impact on the housing recovery Economists worry that all-cash sales are driving home sales and distorting home prices and this is ultimately unsustainable. "I think the high percentage of all-cash sales means that many first-time home buyers and move-up home buyers are not participating in this housing market recovery," Daren Blomquist, vice president at RealtyTrac told Business Insider. "Without those two buyer segments participating in greater measure the housing recovery will not be sustainable for the longer term. If the all-cash sales continue at the high levels we've been seeing the past few months, it could mean a major paradigm shift for the U.S. housing market toward more of a renter nation and less of a home ownership society." Ellen Haberle, real estate economist at Redfin told Business Insider that this activity has prompted homebuyer fatigue. But that this isn't necessarily bad for the housing recovery: "For the housing recovery as a whole, the all-cash buyers have played a key role in giving the housing recovery a kick start and driving up prices.  For many home owners who were underwater on their mortgage, this swift rise in prices has been welcome news—bringing their mortgage right side up and allowing them to sell their home without a loss.  As more homeowners that come out from underwater on their mortgages, more homes will be listed for sale, which will bring the housing market into greater balance. This is not a bad thing for the housing recovery—greater balance means more sustainable and longer-term growth." Part of the reason Davidoff is trying so hard to pin a house down now is because he's wary of the run up in mortgage rates. "We don't really want to get stuck into interest rates starting to increase next year, home prices starting to increase next year. It could price you out of things that you could attempt to get now." Davidoff and his wife began this process thinking it was going to be "fairly easy" because his mother-in-law is his realtor. But he remembers a time when a house would go on the market at eight. At noon, when he would show up to see the house, his car was already the sixth or seventh in line just to see it. "Things have slowed down a bit since then," he said. "But we're still dealing with first day offers, people putting offers in and not even going to see it and you're still dealing with some realtors that will keep a property on the market for just a cash offer." After losing out on a bid two weeks ago where the couple offered $5,100 above the asking price, Davidoff said his wife was ready to give up. But he is a bit more optimistic. "We're in a good situation where we're currently renting, our hand isn't forced like some other people, so we can continue looking. The couple has three more offers out there and expect to hear back from one today. But Davidoff knows that "cash is definitely winning down here in Florida."
dbking, FlickrThe Senate on Friday passed a so-called "clean" continuing resolution, a bill that keeps the government funded through Nov. 15 and averts a government shutdown.  Now it goes back to the House of Representatives. What happens next will likely determine whether the government will shut down on Oct. 1. The key amendment to the Senate's continuing resolution was one that strips language defunding Obamacare, a strategy that has been advocated furiously throughout the week (and the past few months) by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas).  House Speaker John Boehner and leadership now have a few options, according to House and Senate aides: "We’re reviewing our options, and will discuss them with Members tomorrow," said Michael Steel, an aide to Boehner.
Popperfoto /Getty ImagesI don't own a car like this (unfortunately). I also don't don't own stocks on margin.Yesterday, I mentioned that I think the stock market might crash. I'm not predicting a crash — I just think the odds of this happening in the next couple of years are higher than usual (logic here). More importantly, I think the odds are very high that, even if the market doesn't crash, stocks will return far less over the next decade than the double-digit percentages they have returned in the past four years. In light of that view, several readers have asked why I am not selling my stocks or even going short (betting on a crash). After all, if I think there's a "decent chance" of a 30%+ crash in the next year or two, wouldn't this be a wonderful opportunity to make (or at least save) some money? That's a perfectly reasonable question. Here's why I'm not selling my stocks or going short the stock market: * My portfolio is already well diversified.  My savings are composed primarily of low-cost index funds holding stocks, bonds, cash, and real-estate. If the stock market collapsed, this diversification would cushion the blow. It would also (I hope) keep me from panicking and selling near the bottom. (This is a real risk, one I occasionally succumbed to early in my investing career.) I also have enough of my portfolio in cash that, if the market does crash, I'll be able to rebalance into stocks at a much lower level. * I never invest money in the stock market that I need to use in the next 10 years. The stock market does crash occasionally. And the last thing you want is to have to sell your stocks during the period when the market is "crashed." If the stock market crashes permanently, or we get in a Japan-type situation in which stocks remain clobbered for decades, then, yes, I'll be bummed I didn't sell some now. But otherwise I expect any crash to be relatively temporary, just as the crash of 2008-2009 was. * The outlook for other asset classes over the next 10 years is no more attractive than it is for stocks (and, in some possible scenarios, it is worse). If interest rates rise back to normal levels, bonds will get obliterated. Cash is earning nothing. Real-estate is also expensive by many measures. So the last thing I want to do is leap from the pot into the fire. * There seems a reasonable likelihood that inflation will accelerate at some point over the next decade, and stocks are a good hedge against inflation. Unlike bonds and cash, stocks are "real" assets. They represent an ownership share in an enterprise whose business will adjust to inflation by raising the nominal level of prices, wages, and profits. Stocks don't necessarily do well in high-inflation environments (stocks were flat in nominal terms from 1966-1982 and dropped considerably after adjusting for inflation). But they do better than bonds, which get demolished. * Just because I think there's a "decent chance" of a market crash doesn't mean I am highly confident there will be one. I am never highly confident of any short-term market behavior. And I would suggest that anyone who is highly confident about short-term market behavior either doesn't have much market experience or is deluding themselves. I am reasonably confident that stock returns will be crappy for the next decade — because all the valid valuation measures I know of suggest that they will. But sometimes things change fundamentally and the old rules no longer apply. And it's certainly possible that it's "different this time." (That, by the way, is why I'm not 100% confident that returns will be crappy. If you ever meet someone who knows what the market is going to do, please send them my way. I always assumed this person existed, and I spent my decade on Wall Street looking for him/her, but I never found him/her.) * I have learned the hard way that market timing is very difficult and is generally a terrible idea. It is really hard to correctly "time" major market reversals. (I learned this as an analyst during the dotcom crash in 2000, and my mistake cost me and my clients a fortune.) And it is really, really hard to correctly time two major market reversals in a row, which is what I would have to do for it to be a smart idea for me to dump my stocks now. Specifically, if I sell now, and the stock market does, in fact, drop 30%+ from this level in the next couple of years, I will then have to figure out the right moment to get back in. (Given inflation, remaining on the sidelines forever would be a disaster.) If the market drops, say, 25%, it will be because things look so terrible that it will look like the market is going to drop another 25%. And who wants to buy only to have the market crash another 25%? If I set a hard "buy" floor at 30%, meanwhile, the market will no doubt drop 28.8% and then skyrocket, leaving me alone at the station as it rolls away. * The market might not crash. Instead of crashing over the next year or two, the market might rise another 10%-30%-50%-100% and then correct the "imbalance" by parking in place for 10-20 years. It will be psychologically very difficult for me to buy back in at a higher level after selling here, especially if I am still worried about a crash. (And if I wait to buy in until I am NOT worried about a crash, I'll be waiting for Godot.) * If I sell now, I'll have to pay taxes. Thanks to my indexing strategy, I have captured every point of the move up from the 2009 market low. When markets crash, I also buy more of them, so I was lucky enough to get some new stock in 2008 and 2009 at much lower levels than today. So if I sell now, I'll have some capital gains taxes to pay. (I did, stupidly, "rebalance" out of some stocks in 2011 or so, in part because I persuaded myself that we were experiencing a sort of sucker's rally. That dumb-ass move has cost me money between then and now and reaffirmed my conviction that market timing is idiotic. But, on the bright side, I have fewer embedded capital gains taxes to pay.) * Oddly, the best thing that could happen for my long-term stock returns would be for the market to crash 50% and then stay crashed for 5-7 years. I reinvest dividends. So if the market drops by, say, 50% over the next year, and then stays at, say, DOW 7,500 for 5-7 years, I will get to reinvest 5-7 years worth of dividends at half the price per share than I am paying today. This will result in my accumulating twice as many new shares over the next 5-7 years as I will if stocks stay where they currently are. Then, 5-7 years from now, when the stock market finally begins to recover, these new shares will act as a sort of portfolio turbocharger, boosting my returns.   In short, the only thing I am really worried about as a stock-market investor is a permanent crash. And if the stock market crashes permanently, it will likely be because the United States has experienced a communist revolution in which all private assets are seized or some other cataclysm. And if that happens, I'm going to have bigger things to worry about than my stock portfolio ... SEE ALSO: I Think There's A Decent Chance The Stock Market Will Crash
REUTERS/ Ray StubblebineVincent Viola, the CEO of electronic trading firm Virtu Financial, has purchased the Florida Panthers for $250 million. A West Point graduate and once the chairman of the New York Mercantile Exchange, Viola founded a center geared toward helping military officials combat terrorism after the September 11 attacks. He was also a minority owner of the Nets until the basketball team moved to Brooklyn. Viola and his "hockey-mad" family will relocate to South Florida now that the deal has closed.Â From the AP: "We understand the privilege of the stewardship that ownership of a sports franchise really means," Viola said. "We don't really own anything. The players sweat, sacrifice their health in later years to do well on the ice, to provide the right feeling and connection to the fans. It's about the players and the fans and our service to those two respective groups that will determine our success. I really, truly believe that." Viola also gets the Saveology.com Iceplex where the Panthers train, along with team's development partnership with Boyd Gaming, an effort to put a casino adjacent to that arena.

Since 2000, the Panthers have been to the playoffs once. They finished with the fewest points in the NHL last season. So Viola will have his work cut out for him. The team gets very little love in South Florida. Read the full report from the AP&gt;
www.flickr.comThe chatter from some traders on Wall Street is that JC Penney stock is in a beautiful position for a short squeeze, in which investors shorting the stock are forced to cut their losses and exit their trades. Maybe you're optimistic about JC Penney's future — maybe you're not. Regardless, the retailer's offering of 84 million shares at $9.65 could be seen as an opportunity for the three largest shareholders of the stock, hedge funds Glenview Capital, Soros Fund Management and Perry Capital, to buy up more stock to shore up their investment. In doing so they would be buying JC Penney time to get its business together — to show some growth during the holiday season and get its stores fully restocked with merchandise its customers like. Here's how traders are thinking about the squeeze — its not that crazy if you follow the logic: So far the stock today has been steadily below the price offered, but it hasn't plummeted more than 15% (like it did earlier this week). To some traders, like Risk Reversal's Dan Nathan, that suggests that Goldman Sachs, the bank underwriting the share offering, is allowing those holding the stocks with weaker stomachs to get out of the way. J.C. Penney stock is no longer for the faint of heart. "Usually with a deal like this the underwriter has an over-allotment where they can stabilize the deal," said Nathan. "Goldman Sachs chose not to, and let the weak hands sell. Then once they're out of the way, Goldman can turn around and buy. Then the stock should go up to the deal price.... Shorts should be covering on a day like today." The way some traders see it, once the stock starts creeping back up to the share offer price of $9.65, the short sellers will start to feel the squeeze. That's when big hedge funds with an interest in the company can push the stock up until it's really uncomfortable for short sellers, clearing out the sellers and leaving only buyers. "It could be a coiled spring on the slightest bit of good news," said Nathan. On the other hand... But there are plenty of short sellers that are holding fast. Nathan also pointed out that 38% of floats on J.C. Penney stock are short, and in the options market, J.C. Penney puts have become quite popular. So it could be that the sellers here aren't going to quit, the stock is sinking like a stone, and there's nothing three of the biggest, baddest hedge fund managers in the world can do about it.
DonkeyHotey/FlickrThere are two strategic problems the White House needs to deal with on the debt limit.Â  One is that House Republicans might be so disorganized, or so radicalized, that they fail to provide a reasonably clean debt limit increase to the President before Oct. 17, at which point the government will be unable to pay some bills when due. It would be good for the White House to have a Plan D to prevent any missed payments if that happens. Minting platinum coins is such a Plan D, one that is legally sounder than other options, such as invoking the 14th Amendment provision against repudiation of the United States' debt. But if Republicans know the White House has a viable Plan D, they'll be more willing to attach insane demands to any debt limit increases. Republicans are afraid of causing a default for which they'll be blamed. If they know the White House will be able to stave off a default on its own, they'll be less likely to back down. That's why killing the platinum coin, annoying as it was for me, was a key part of the White House's strategy to engineer Republicans' last cave on the debt ceiling, in January. With the coin option off the table, Republicans were left staring default in the face, and they blinked. They agreed to a months-long increase in the debt limit for basically nothing. Reviving the coin could make a crisis more likely by emboldening Republicans to put the White House in a position where they feel compelled to mint it. Fortunately, there is a way to thread this needle. Bring back the coin, but don't tell anybody. For all we know, the coin dies are already sitting in Treasury Secretary Jack Lew's desk, ready to be sent to the mint on a moment's notice. If they were, he certainly wouldn't be telling anybody. In January, the Treasury said that not only did they think the coin was a viable option, but the Federal Reserve would not accept it for deposit. But I don't think the threat to refuse the coin for deposit is credible. Federal law authorizes Treasury to mint platinum coins in whatever amount it pleases, and also obligates the Federal Reserve to accept valid cash deposits from Treasury. As Matt Yglesias points out, a Federal Reserve that declines the coin deposit would be acting illegally: @LorenAdler In the joint release they seemed to be just promising to break the law. If they refuse, they should be arrested. The coin option is still viable. But it's most useful if nobody in Washington talks about it too much.
C-SPAN The Senate on Friday passed its version of a bill to keep the government funded and avert a government shutdown, the latest move in legislative ping-pong between the two chambers of Congress. The Senate's continuing resolution funds the government through Nov. 15, and it strips language in a House of Representatives "CR" to defund the Affordable Care Act. The final vote passed in a 54-44 vote. The Senate held a series of final votes on the bill Friday afternoon. In its first vote shortly after 12:30 p.m., the Senate invoked cloture on the bill, ending debate by an overwhelming 79-19 vote. That allowed Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to bring up an amendment stripping language that defunds the Affordable Care Act for a majority vote. That amendment passed around 1:30, in a 54-44, party-line vote. The initial cloture vote was a big defeat for Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), the leader of the "defund Obamacare" effort, who had spent most of the week trying unsuccessfully to convince Republican senators to vote against cloture. In a statement, Cruz blasted Reid and "Senate Democrats" for "not listening to the people." He also emphasized his call for the House to hold firm on Obamacare defunding.  "The House showed remarkable courage voting to defund Obamacare, and I hope and believe that the House will stand by their resolve and continue to lead the effort to stop the Obamacare train wreck," Cruz said. The House passed its version of the continuing resolution a week ago Friday, which included language to defund the Affordable Care Act. Much of the debate this week in the Senate has revolved around Cruz, the leader of the "defund Obamacare" effort, his 21-hour talk-a-thon on Tuesday/Wednesday, and his pleas to get Republican senators to back his effort. Instead, his strategy has caused GOP divisions, and it looks extremely unlikely that he'll get the necessary votes to block Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid from passing an amendment that strips the House's "defund" language. On Thursday, Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) laid into Cruz on the Senate floor when Cruz objected to moving the Senate vote up. Senate passage won't avert a government shutdown — yet. House Speaker John Boehner said it is unlikely he'll move the Senate's bill through the House without amending it, setting up more ping-pong. Here's the schedule of the votes Friday: This post has been updated.
If Congress can't get a budget deal soon, then we may see the government shut down at least temporarily starting October 1. On top of that, the U.S. is once again inching toward the debt ceiling. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said October 17 would be the deadline for Congress to raise the debt ceiling. "If we have insufficient cash on hand, it would be impossible for the United States of America to meet all of its obligations for the first time in our history," wrote Lew. "So far, investors have been complacent about the risks posed by the looming budget fight," said Nouriel Roubini. "They believe that â€“ as in the past â€“ the fiscal showdown will end with a midnight compromise that avoids both default and a government shutdown." "But investors seem to underestimate how dysfunctional US national politics has become," warned Roubini. "With a majority of the Republican Party on a jihad against government spending, fiscal explosions this autumn cannot be ruled out." "Little to no volatility premium is priced into the options market for the debt ceiling debates, in our view," said Goldman Sachs' Robert Boroujerdi noting the complacency. "S&amp;P 500 put prices are near their lowest level since the financial crisis." Here's a chart from Goldman Sachs' Robert Boroujerdi showing how the S&amp;P 500 traded before and after the last three incidents. "While past performance is not an indicator of future results, we find these case studies useful," he said. Goldman Sachs
Yesterday we told you which states have the biggest problems with which drugs. What about for the country as a whole? Via the DEA, here is the evolution of drug seizures between 1986 and 2012. The figures can be largely taken as a proxy for which drugs were most popular when. But they're also a reflection of laws and economics. As a result, you'll notice that seizures of some drugs have come down significantly thanks since the Great Recession, as well as the dialing back of the war on drugs under the Obama administration.Â Meanwhile, cheaper drugs have seen their popularity climb.

Bloomberg TelevisionThrough the second half of 2011, debate raged in financial markets over whether the U.S. Federal Reserve would embark on a third round of massive bond purchases, known as "quantitative easing," to shore up an anemic economy. Pacific Investment Management Co wasn't waiting to find out. The giant fund-management firm, led by co-founder Bill Gross, started buying tens of billions of dollars in mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by federally sponsored agencies like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In the third quarter of 2011 alone, Pimco's flagship Total Return Fund, the world's largest mutual fund, doubled its holdings of these securities to $80 billion, according to a Reuters review of trading and other data. While Pimco was building its hoard, the Fed, in a surprise move long before any word on quantitative easing, said it would start buying more of the same kind of debt, known in the trade as "agency MBS." The U.S. central bank would acquire as much as $30 billion of the securities a month by reinvesting proceeds from its earlier purchases. Prices rose. As 2011 slid into 2012, Pimco started enjoying big gains on its agency holdings. Even better, the Fed in September 2012 finally announced a third round of quantitative easing, nicknamed QE3. To keep supporting the U.S. housing market, it would buy even more agency MBS. Pimco's Total Return Fund posted billions more dollars in gains. Pimco's winning bet unfolded like this: * In December 2008, the Fed hired Pimco, along with three other big Wall Street firms, to implement enormous purchases of agency MBS to keep interest rates low and spur the U.S. economy. * Over the next few years, Pimco repeatedly invested heavily in those same securities - far more than other big investors, even considering its size. * Pimco's mortgage plays in 2009 and 2012 - when Fed buying was heavy - handed the firm and investors in the Total Return Fund a gainof $10 billion, excluding net investment flows, according to Reuters estimates. There is no evidence of illegality or impropriety in Pimco's actions. Pimco says that it kept its employees who were helping the Fed at arm's length from those investing for its funds, and that its bond-buying bet was conceived before the Fed's program was begun. The Fed says it implemented and enforced strict controls over the trading done by the firms. But Pimco's ability to enrich its returns by following the Fed does illustrate how the Fed's easy-money policy over the past five years has produced outsized winners. As one of them, Pimco benefited enormously from the very Fed policies that it was helping to implement. A Reuters review of more than 14,000 trades by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Pimco over the past five years shows that Pimco has consistently been on the money in anticipating the Fed's actions in the agency MBS market. Gross and other Pimco executives credit their success to the Fed's transparency in announcing its intentions and to their own expertise in buying assets when they are cheap and in analyzing the broader economy. "Anticipate, then buy what they buy, only do it first," as Gross put it in the January 2009 installment of his monthly "Investment Outlook" on Pimco's website. The Reuters analysis of quarterly Pimco Total Return Fund holdings and of Fed actions suggests that Pimco's expertise was augmented by other factors: its size, the Fed's choice of an intervention program perfectly tailored for Pimco to exploit, and a close relationship with the Fed. The firm had brought in former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan as a consultant in 2007. Gross's top lieutenant, Mohamed El-Erian, serves on an advisory committee to the central bank's most important branch, the New York Fed. Pimco's global strategic adviser, economist Richard Clarida, has known Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke for three decades and was reported to be in the running for a seat on the Fed's board of governors in 2011. Pimco, a unit of German financial-services firm Allianz SE, was one of four firms the central bank hired to help it buy agency MBS in 2009 under the first phase of quantitative easing, called QE1. In essence, these firms collaborated with the Fed on writing its playbook for the program. The aim was to stimulate lending and spending by driving down interest rates through mass purchases of bonds, flooding the market with cash. Two of the other three Fed helpers - Goldman Sachs Group Inc and BlackRock Inc - also scored big returns on bond funds during the program. However, they didn't bet on agency MBS to the degree Pimco did. Reuters was unable to determine whether the fourth contractor, advisory firm Wellington Management Co, was advising any funds trading mortgage securities at the time. RARE CONFIDENCE Pimco, by contrast, exhibited a rare confidence in its agency MBS trading. At one point in March 2009, for example, 91 percent of the Total Return Fund's assets were in agency MBS, according to data from investment research firm Morningstar Inc. That level was unusual for the fund and far exceeds that of any comparable fund at the time. By contrast, agency MBS accounted for 38.7 percent of assets in the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index, the industry benchmark. In his January 2009 web posting, Gross said Pimco's aim was to "shake hands with the government." And in an interview with Reuters in February this year, he said: "It is a good strategy to anticipate what the Fed is going to do, and when they do it, to cooperate with them. … So that is what we've been doing." "Pimco knew the policy that the Fed was attempting to achieve, and it could readily stock up on those types of securities," says Anthony Sanders, professor of real-estate finance at George Mason University. "Buying for the Fed in the volumes that the Fed was buying would almost certainly result in price increases in the specific MBS. So why wouldn't Pimco build a quick portfolio of these securities and take advantage of valuation increases or cash returns?" Doing so was perfectly permissible under the Fed program. The central bank allowed Pimco and the other three firms to continue trading in agency MBS while some of their employees were seconded to the central bank. Contracts that the firms signed with the New York Fed prohibited the firms' traders or employees from discussing their work. "Based on what has been shown to us by Reuters, the New York Fed has no reason to believe that Pimco behaved improperly as an investment manager," a New York Fed spokesman said. A spokesman for Pimco said its "investment performance is the result of the firm's analysis of an extensive volume of publicly available information as well as its valuations of securities. These, and no other factors, contributed to the risk-adjusted returns delivered for the firm's clients … with respect to agency mortgage backed securities." In earlier installments of its Uneasy Money series, Reuters showed how the Fed's bond purchases, while underpinning the U.S. economy's recovery, have created asset bubbles in unexpected places. Investors chasing higher returns have piled into subprime auto loans, for example. Much of the benefit of the cheap credit has flowed to well-to-do investors even as the job market remains soft. Some financiers have profited on the very same subprime mortgage bonds that nearly sank the financial system five years ago. In the case of Pimco, the issue isn't economic or market distortion. Rather, it is the appearance of a possible conflict of interest by allowing Pimco to act for the Fed and its own investors at the same time. "The Fed provides non-public information on new programs to select private parties that trade the same securities as a fiduciary to investors and, after creating the program with the input of those firms, hands contracts to those same firms to purchase securities both for the Fed and private investors," says Joshua Rosner, managing director of independent research firm Graham Fisher &amp; Co. TEACHING AND LEARNING At the height of the financial crisis in 2008, when the Fed's initial announcement of quantitative easing was still several months away, Pimco was overweight in agency MBS. The Total Return Fund was increasing its holdings of the securities when, on September 7, the U.S. government seized control of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac amid the agencies' mounting losses. The next day, the bond fund posted a 1.32 percent return, one of its strongest days ever, as prices of mortgage securities rose. By the end of the month, 74.8 percent of the fund's holdings were in agency MBS, compared with 59.13 percent in December 2007. A Pimco spokesman said the firm "began overweighting mortgage exposure when our analysis indicated that these mortgages were attractive relative to other investment opportunities, which was well before any managers were hired by the Federal Reserve, before the AMBS purchase program was announced by the Federal Reserve, and presumably before the program was even conceived." Then, on November 25, as the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc and the U.S. government bailout of American International Group reverberated through the global financial system, the Fed announced a support plan for the economy. Among other measures, it would buy up to $500 billion in agency MBS. Rosner of Graham Fisher says the Fed could have avoided any appearance of conflict of interest if it had hired its own traders. But the central bank had never bought agency MBS on such a scale, and it decided it needed help. It turned to the pros: Pimco, Goldman, BlackRock and Wellington, all of which were selected through competitive bidding. Together, they set up operations to buy agency MBS for the Fed, starting in January 2009. "The firms were chosen because their deep experience with agency MBS markets would enable the New York Fed to launch the program quickly while minimizing risk," a New York Fed spokesman said. Among other controls, the spokesman said, the New York Fed required the firms to physically separate trading staff from other employees. They also had to ensure that no information flowed between the traders making purchases at the New York Fed's direction and other traders at the firms. Each firm had to certify in writing that it was in compliance with the required controls and was subject to internal and external audits. Pimco assigned star trader Dan Hyman to help oversee the firm's role in the project. The operation was set up in a secure room at Pimco's Newport Beach, California, headquarters. Access required a keycard. DAILY DISCUSSIONS The Pimco team, according to a person familiar with the program, held daily calls with counterparts at the other firms and with the New York Fed. On the calls, the group discussed which securities to buy for the Fed and when. Goldman said it "created a separate, dedicated team to manage the Federal Reserve program that was walled off with both physical and informational barriers and technological firewalls." BlackRock said that its buying for the Fed was carried out by BlackRock Solutions, a separate business from its money-management arm, and that "strict and effective policies and procedures" were in place to manage potential conflicts of interest. Wellington declined to comment for this article. Pimco's size was well-suited to the Fed's program, relative to its peers. The Total Return Fund, with $251.1 billion under management, dwarfs other actively managed bond funds. The next largest managed intermediate bond fund, the DoubleLine Total Return Fund, has just $35.4 billion under management. That means that to generate meaningful profits from the tiny increments in which mortgage bond prices move, Pimco had to make big bets. To do that, it used a huge but little-known agency MBS derivatives market, called the to-be-announced, or TBA, market, taking positions many times larger than those of its fellow Fed contractors. And the only way the Fed could buy agency MBS in bulk was through the TBA market. Here, investors enter into contracts to buy at a later date pools of agency MBS with certain generic characteristics in common - such as the maturity and the coupon, or initial interest rate. At settlement, the seller delivers a bundle of various newly issued and existing bonds that meet the criteria. The broad specifications in the contracts give the TBA market much more liquidity and depth than any other market for mortgage bonds, making it easier for participants to trade huge amounts of securities. Thus any investor familiar with agency MBS could have guessed that the Fed would use the TBA market. Also, the Fed publishes its trading results weekly. "Here is the Fed saying, 'We're going to make this huge, huge investment in mortgage-backed securities," says John Merrick, a College of William &amp; Mary finance professor who wrote about the TBA market in a 2012 analysis. On March 18, 2009, the Fed increased its original $500 billion target for QE1 to as much as $1.25 trillion. (The Fed also said it would buy up to $300 billion in long-term Treasury securities.) That was a big day for Pimco: The Total Return Fund reported an unusually high 1.32 percent return, matching its gain when Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were seized. BIG LEAP The fund was steadily increasing its TBA holdings - by more than twentyfold, quarterly records show, from about $2 billion in June 2008 to $43 billion at the end of March 2009. That's when the Total Return Fund's overall agency mortgage exposure reached an extraordinary 91 percent of total assets, or $132 billion. Over the course of the year, former Fed Chairman and then-Pimco consultant Greenspan met twice for breakfast with current Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke - on March 5 and on July 9, according to Bernanke's calendar. What they discussed isn't known. Greenspan, who has since left Pimco, declined to comment. A spokesperson for the Fed declined to comment, citing guidelines that prohibit the release of confidential information. Pimco invested in agency MBS that then rose in value when Pimco's Fed advisory team bought the same securities for the Fed. By the end of March 2009, for example, the Total Return Fund owned $1.26 billion of a Fannie Mae 30-year TBA security paying 5.5 percent, valuing it at 103.55 cents on the dollar, according to quarterly data on the fund's holdings. Then, between April 17 and May 6, Pimco bought $11 billion of the same security for the Fed's books, paying a higher price of 103.81 on average, the Fed's trading records show. Overall, the Reuters analysis shows that of the $186 billion of Fannie Mae TBA securities Pimco bought on behalf of the Fed during QE1, it owned at least $80 billion of the same securities. For all of 2009, Pimco's Total Return Fund posted a return of 13.83 percent. It was the fund's best showing in a decade, beating the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index by nearly eight percentage points - its widest spread over the benchmark, according to Morningstar, since 1988, the fund's first full year of operation. By far the biggest contributor - at 4.15 percentage points - was the fund's bet on mortgage bonds of all types, according to a confidential breakdown of the fund's returns obtained by Reuters. It's not known how much agency MBS specifically contributed to that return, but two reports from the time highlight how Pimco cashed in on the agency MBS market. In a September 2009 report to investors, Pimco said the firm's oversized bets on agency MBS were "strongly positive for returns" and that values had "richened substantially." In November 2009, Morningstar analyst Eric Jacobson wrote that "a sizable government mortgage bet has been the fund's most helpful in 2009. Large mortgage purchases by the Fed have drained supply and pushed up prices." PEERS SHINE Goldman and BlackRock also ramped up their holdings of agency MBS. They didn't do so as aggressively, but their funds, which are smaller, managed to score even better returns than Pimco's flagship fund. One of Goldman's largest bond funds and its closest peer to the Pimco Total Return Fund is the $1.2 billion Core Fixed Income Fund. It cut its agency MBS exposure to 31 percent in March 2009 from 47 percent in December 2008, suggesting that the fund took some profits on Fed buying. The level then remained fairly static over the ensuing months. The fund posted a 16.3 percent return for 2009. From the end of 2008 to March 31, 2009, the $2.9 billion BlackRock Total Return Fund's holdings of agency MBS fell to 43.5 percent of assets from 46.5 percent, while the $2.8 billion BlackRock Core Bond Fund's agency MBS holdings fell to 40.4 percent from 46.4 percent. These shifts suggest both funds were able to book some gains by selling into Fed buying, but without having made any bets far in excess of the Barclays benchmark. BlackRock's Total Return Fund and Core Bond Fund returned 15.2 percent and 14.5 percent, respectively, in 2009. For their services to the Fed in 2009, Pimco, Goldman and BlackRock were paid $11.2 million apiece, according to a 2011 U.S. Government Accountability Office report. Wellington was paid $26.6 million under an extended contract to March 2010. From then on, the New York Fed, having gained expertise in buying agency MBS, managed its own trading desk. The Pimco spokesman said the firm "strictly adhered to all of the Federal Reserve's program policies and procedures that were established to prevent conflicts of interest and maintain confidentiality of all non-public information. Pimco's participation in the program did not confer to the firm any informational advantage, both during and at any time after Pimco's work on the program." It isn't known when Hyman returned to his job on the firm's mortgage bond trading desk. Based on the contract that Pimco signed with the New York Fed, a Pimco employee would have had to adhere to a "cooling off" period of about six weeks. Those who worked for the New York Fed were forbidden by contract to use any knowledge gained from working for the Fed when trading for Pimco. Hyman didn't respond to requests for comment. REPEAT PERFORMANCE In November 2010, the Fed announced a second round of bond buying, known as QE2. This time, the central bank said it would buy $600 billion in longer-term Treasury securities. Pimco didn't do as well in its bets on the much-bigger Treasury bond market as it did on agency MBS. In early 2011, as the Fed approached the end of its QE2 purchases, the Total Return Fund sold its Treasury holdings, according to Pimco data. But it misread the market. Treasuries rallied as a sovereign debt crisis raged in Europe and investors sought the safety of U.S. government bonds. On June 30, the Fed completed QE2. Immediately, market chatter turned to whether there would be a QE3, amid a persistently sluggish U.S. economic recovery. El-Erian, an Oxford and Cambridge graduate who has held top positions at the International Monetary Fund and Harvard University, said Gross's view at the time was that economic conditions would require the Fed to return, because "we are nowhere near escape velocity." Pimco started buying agency mortgage bonds again. On September 21, 2011, as the Total Return Fund's holdings of TBA securities approached $50 billion, the Fed, in a surprise move, said it would begin reinvesting principal payments from agency MBS and other debt it owned. That meant the Fed, to Pimco's benefit, would begin buying up to $30 billion of mortgage securities a month. 'LOTS OF SMILES' By March 2012, the Total Return Fund's agency mortgage investments were back up to about half of the fund's total holdings. Indeed, between June 2011 and June 2012, Pimco again exhibited unusual confidence in its agency MBS bets. Among the top 20 actively managed intermediate bond funds, the three that made the largest increases in their agency MBS investments during that period were managed by Pimco, Morningstar data shows. The Harbor Bond Fund, managed by Gross, raised its exposure by more than 40 percentage points, the Pimco Total Return Fund by about 30 points, and the Pimco Investment Grade Corporate Bond Fund by 24 points. None of the other top 20 funds had a double-digit increase. The Total Return Fund zeroed in on agency MBS that had relatively low coupons. "We liked them" because they were "cheap," says Scott Simon, then head of Pimco's mortgage trading desk, who has since retired. Additionally, "if the Fed wanted to shore up the housing market and create refinancing, they would lower the mortgage rate. If they wanted to lower the mortgage rate, they would buy (bonds with coupons of) 3 percent and 3.5 percent." That prediction was validated as the Fed bought Fannie Mae securities that paid a 3.5 percent coupon in 2012, before announcing QE3. "That is a dynamite combination when you have a cheap asset with the possibility of the central bank buying … billions of them down the road," Gross said. "It's not a 'can't miss' proposition, but it's a decent 'odds on' proposition." The party continued after Bernanke finally announced QE3 in September last year. Gross said there were "lots of smiles but no high fives" at Pimco's investment committee meeting that day. "As I remember it personally, it was a silent but emphatic 'Yes!' - with an exclamation point." The Total Return Fund's mortgage holdings once again jumped in value. All told, the Fed added nearly $500 billion of agency MBS to its books in 2012, switching from securities with mainly 3.5 percent coupons before the QE3 announcement to 3 percent after. Pimco followed suit. By the end of the year, the Total Return Fund was up 10.36 percent, exceeding the Barclays benchmark index by six percentage points. That 10.36 percent gain equates to about $25.3 billion, excluding net investment flows. About $5 billion came from bets on agency and non-agency mortgage securities, according to Reuters estimates. The fund's banner year was also helped by smart calls on Treasury bonds and corporate debt. Pimco is struggling this year because it again failed to correctly call the bond market, which sold off sharply in May and June. "Selling begat more selling, even in Treasuries," Gross wrote in one of his recent web postings. On May 22 and again on June 19, Bernanke hinted that the central bank might cut back on QE3, leading to sharp swings in Treasury values as investors sought to sell ahead of the Fed. Yields on the 10-year Treasury, which hit 1.61 percent on May 1, soared to 2.52 percent at the end of June. Investors withdrew $9.6 billion from the Total Return Fund in June, a monthly record, according to Morningstar. The fund is down about two percent so far this year, according to Pimco's website. Still, Pimco has locked in much of its gains on agency MBS by selling down its hoard to the Wall Street dealers who then sell to the Fed. "You never go broke taking a profit," Gross said. "We've sold … tens of billions of agency mortgages to the Fed, which is … basically what we intended to do." (Editing by Paritosh Bansal and John Blanton)
Even if JC Penney is able to raise the $932 million it's hoping for in its recent share offering, it still has to have a "historic" holiday season to survive. Why? Because debt. That's why. Brian Sozzi, CEO &amp; Chief Equities Strategist at Belus Capital Advisors, reminded everyone of this fact in a note last month. JC Penney has some serious bills to pay, and like all bills, there's a deadline. Sozzi wrote: Under its newly expanded, $2.25 billion credit agreement, outstanding balances have to be repaid by April 4, 2014. At the end of the first quarter, JC Penney had remaining availability of $526.0 million. The company will need a historic holiday season and start to 2014 to fund the payment of borrowings with cash on hand. After announcing that it would sell 84 million shares at $9.65, JC Penney stock is down 10.6% to $9.32. All over Wall Street, analysts are lowering their price targets too. Citi has lowered its target to $7, and JP Morgan has it at $8. Goldman, after writing a note about JC Penney's cash problems that sent the stock down over 15% this week, has a the bull case for the stock at $20, and the bear case at $1. So lets walk through all the possible scenarios here. JC Penney could us the cash it gets from this share offering to have an amazing holiday season, kill it in Q1 2014, and pay off their creditors easily. That seems highly unlikely at this point. In fact, analysts aren't even expecting the company to turn a profit. They're expecting losses of $0.95 a share. So it's more likely that JC Penney will not have a great holiday season at all. In that case, according to Sozzi, the company does have an option — selling real estate. "Real estate is tied to prior round of financing," he said. "[The] company did tell me they have 10-20 stores in upper income malls they could sell to mall developers to raise cash. But in retail, these situations take on a mind of their own. Once a domino is pushed down, the rest very often continue to fall in order. A share issuance, and convertible debt offerings, are often a company's last efforts to prevent an ugly end and a trip to the courts (reorganization). Sounds odd, but the best tell on the future of JC Penney will be to watch the stock price every day, it's now pricing in probable business outcomes for 1Q14." Refinancing, Sozzi added, is unlikely. And if JC Penney does manage to renegotiate with its creditors, rates will worsen. We'll be watching.
REUTERS/Carlos Garcia Rawlins A passenger walks at the Simon Bolivar airport in La Guaira, outside Caracas September 23, 2013. Flights are booked solid months in advance, not from a new interest in exotic destinations but because locals are profiting from a play on the nation's tightly controlled currency market. The airline scramble has added to shortages, power cuts and runaway prices as another symbol of the Byzantine economic challenges facing the new government of President Nicolas Maduro in the South American OPEC nation. Picture taken on September 23, 2013. Socialism has consequences when the rest of the world is capitalist. Thanks to their country's managed currency rates, Venezuelans are now pulling off epic scams as the value of the dollar spikes against the bolivar on the black market, Reuters'Â Girish Gupta and Andrew Cawthorne report. Right now, the street value of greenbacks has soared to 7x the government's rate of VEF6.3 to the dollar. So those Venezuelans who are able to are flying abroad, swiping their credit cards to take out a cash advance, flying home, and making bank.Â  Here's how it works, according to Bloomberg, which has also reported on the phenomenon: "A 27-year-old trade analyst from Caracas said she earned six times her monthly salary by traveling in April to Lima, where a business swiped her credit card and gave her $1,600 cash, charged at the official exchange rate of 6.3 bolivars per dollar. When the analyst, who requested anonymity because what she did is illegal, returned to Venezuela, she sold the dollars at the street rate of 29-to-1, enough to pocket 25,000 bolivars after paying off her credit card and travel expenses." The trade more than pays off the cost of their travels. Although some are not even bothering to travel, Reuters says, instead mailing their credit cards to a friend, who swipe out the card on their end and ship the cash back. "It is possible to travel abroad for free due to this exchange rate magic," local economist Angel Garcia Banchs told Reuters. One Venezuelan woman said, "I've been able to buy new clothes and give some cash to all my closest family members!"Â  The scam even has a name:Â  "el raspao," or "the scrape." And it's proven so popular that flights abroad are now booked solid for months.  Read the full story at Reuters Â»
flickr/Ayaka DarklyToday, BofA Merrill Lynch commodities team, led by metals strategist Michael Widmer, lowered the bank's forecasts for gold prices in 2013, 2014, and 2015, citing investor focus on an eventual normalization of Federal Reserve monetary policy. Despite the forecast reductions, though, the BofA analysts say they "remain longer-term bulls" on the shiny yellow metal. BAML's 2013 average gold price forecast was lowered 4% to $1419 an ounce (from $1478), while its 2014 forecast dropped 17% to $1294 (from $1563) and its 2015 forecast dropped 18% to $1356 (from $1654). Widmer argues in a note to clients that after the fiscal battles in Washington are sorted out in October, "investors likely refocus on the gradual normalisation of monetary policy in the U.S., suggesting that gold prices could fall into 2014." "Interest rates measure the opportunity costs of owning a non-yielding asset," says Widmer. "Therefore, they are the transmission channel from the real economy to the precious metal ... suggesting that a gradual increase of U.S. real interest rates should be accompanied by lower gold prices in 2014, a key reason behind the reduction of price forecasts." By 2016, however, BAML analysts expect the bull market in gold to make a comeback. In today's report, Widmer points clients to a note he published in late May that explains why: However, looking further out, we see further potential upside to gold prices. Our models show, for instance, that the importance of investors as marginal buyers could subside gradually (Chart 21). This trend is heavily influenced by rising affluence in emerging markets, which should result in more spending on luxury goods like jewelry. In fact, we estimate that jewelry demand may become so pronounced by 2016 that prices could trade above $1,500/oz even if investors were net sellers. Looking at sensitivities from a different angle, we estimate investors would need to buy merely 600t of gold to sustain prices at $2,000/oz by 2016, compared to non-commercial purchases of 1,798t in 2012.

Wikimedia Commons A lot of the time when people talk about the risk of a debt ceiling breach, they talk about the stock market dive or an interest rate spike because maybe creditors might not lend to us at ultra-low rates anymore. But really these pedestrian concerns don't get at what makes a debt ceiling breach so concerning. Luckily, Kevin Roose has written a great explainer of the debt ceiling at NYMag and he includes this paragraph: The central nervous system of the banking system might freeze. Fedwire is one of the least-known, most important services on Earth. It's a clearing system, run by the Federal Reserve, that banks in America use to shuttle cash, stocks, bonds, and other assets back and forth between themselves. It processes trillions of dollars a day, and has been around for nearly 100 years. But it's not set up to allow defaulted Treasury bonds to flow through its system. According to a note from RBC Capital, excerpted by FT Alphaville, if the U.S. defaults on its bonds, Fedwire could "seize" entirely, meaning that banks and other financial institutions could run into real trouble very quickly. Read Kevin's whole piece here. It's great. And once you see how bad it could be, you'll see why you should just favor a government shutdown to stave off the crisis.
APOn Thursday, House Republicans released the outline of a bill to raise the debt ceiling that included what an analyst described as a "Dear Santa" wish list of conservative priorities. It also led a senior White House adviser to cast Republicans as suicide bombers, arsonists, and kidnappers. When asked, an aide to House Speaker John Boehner wouldn't offer specifics Thursday on some of the proposals in the debt-ceiling bill. That was because the proposal was still int he works — and because, later in the day, it blew up in the face of House Republican leadership.  Conservative House Republicans pushed back against the plan. And by the end of the day, leadership at least temporarily shelved the plan and, according to Politico, could wait a week before bringing anything back to consider. This wasn't as public a blow up as some of leadership's past failures, such as the failed 2011 debt-ceiling vote and the "Plan B" gambit leading up to the fiscal cliff last December.  But it underscores, yet again, how much trouble leadership will have in satisfying the demands of the most conservative members of their party while also producing a winning strategy. In this case, House conservatives didn't like the plan because they didn't think it sufficiently tackled entitlement reform.  Rep. Tom Rooney (R-Fla.) told The Hill that the plan "doesn't address the debt." Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) said he wanted the debate over funding the government to conclude before lawmakers tackle the debt ceiling. That led Rep. Tom Cole (Okla.), an ally of Boehner and member of the GOP whip team, to conclude that leadership didn't yet have the votes. The path forward on raising the debt ceiling remains a complete mystery. The government-shutdown fight still will take some time to resolve. The Senate will likely pass a "clean" version of the continuing resolution on Friday, but Boehner said he will likely not look to pass it through the House without adding some amendments. Meanwhile, even if leadership did round up enough votes for the debt-ceiling bill, the Senate and President Barack Obama have flatly said that they will reject it.  Reminder: The debt-ceiling needs to be raised by Oct. 17 — 20 days.
MicrosoftMicrosoft CEO Steve BallmerMicrosoft will get back on track thanks to its "tremendous resources and reach," Silver Lake managing partner Mike Bingle said today at the Dow Jones Private Equity Analyst Conference. "I think they’ve got a lot of levers within Microsoft to pull to continue to be a great business," said Bingle, whose firm has over $20 billion of assets under management and is one of the largest investors in technology. "It will get its groove back," Bingle said. In August, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer announced he will be stepping down after 13 years leading the company. His successor will face a spate of major challenges. As BI Intelligence found, Microsoft's share of all global computing has fallen to 24%. Years ago, Microsoft had 90% of the computing market. By now you know the story, but Microsoft has long been under siege from Apple and Google. The company's fall from grace — and its inability to keep up with competitors — has been highly publicized. Still, "The railroads didn't become the airlines," Bingle noted. "Everyone misses opportunities."
Bloomberg TVLast week, following the Federal Reserve's surprise decision to refrain from tapering back its quantitative easing program, JPMorgan chief U.S. equity strategist Tom Lee told clients that the indication of continued easing should be enough to support stocks through the end of the year. Lee has a year-end S&amp;P 500 price target of 1775. Today, the index is trading around 1690, so Lee's forecast implies an additional 5% upside for stocks over the next three months. In his latest note to clients today, Lee gives three reasons why he thinks that is likely: "Investor apprehension about this market continues to increase," says Lee. "It is the combination of fears that this was a 'false breakout' to new highs coupled with lingering concerns about the budget/debt ceiling showdown in the U.S. and the possible resulting turmoil. That said, we remain constructive on equities into [year-end] and still see the S&amp;P 500 reaching at least 1775."
Google FinanceMarkets are in the red early in the U.S. trading session. The Dow is down 103 points. The S&amp;P 500 is down 9 points. The Nasdaq is down 12 points. At this rate, the would be the sixth down day in seven trading sessions. All of this comes as Congress continues to debate the budget. Without an agreement, we could see a government shutdown next Tuesday. "In the event of a government shutdown, functions of the federal government considered â€œnon-essentialâ€ cease while â€œessentialâ€ functions continue," wrote Barclays' Michael Gapen and Michael Gavin. "Our economists estimate that for every week the government is shut down, real federal government consumption and gross investment falls 1.6% q/q saar and quarterly real GDP growth declines 0.1pp." "If a shutdown is avoided, it is likely to be because congressional Republicans have opted to wait and push for policy concessions on the debt limit instead," wrote Goldman Sachs' Alec Phillips. "By contrast, if a shutdown occurs, we would be surprised if congressional Republicans would want to risk another difficult situation only a couple of weeks later. "The upshot is that while a shutdown would be unnecessarily disruptive, it might actually ease passage of a debt limit increase."
REUTERS/Carlo AllegriStephen Pagliuca, managing director of Bain CapitalFor many Americans, the private equity industry is shrouded in mystery. Mitt Romney's private equity background at Bain Capital was used as a cudgel against him during the 2012 campaign. What public value does private equity add, his opponents asked? A business of buying and selling other businesses? Is that actually good for humanity — or just investors? At the Dow Jones Private Equity Analyst Conference in New York, HarbourVest Partners' Managing Director George Anson said the industry has to reverse that narrative going forward. Private equity is really a "force for good," Anson said. It may be more secretive, but it's also more long term than people realize, he told conference-goers. Private equity firms are concerned with "encouraging productivity and competitiveness" over time, Anson said. In Europe, where Anson works, private equity firms hold companies for an average of five years. "I challenge any public equity manager or hedge fund manager to beat that." But private equity firms have to show the public tangible examples of companies growing under their leadership, Anson said. And that's hard to communicate in an industry under less government and public scrutiny. "I don't know that one private equity firm on its own can convince [people] that private equity in and of itself is going to solve all the nation's problems," Anson said. But: "I think there was a passive approach to public opinion in the past and I think those days are gone." Most (but not all) of private equity firms are, almost by definition, private. "There's a reason it's called private equity," Bain Capital Managing Director Stephen Pagliuca said. Without the extra reporting and regulatory burden that comes with being publicly traded, "You can be long-term oriented and do what you need to do." Pagliuca knows a thing or two about dealing with the public perception of private equity. He co-owns the Boston Celtics, and in 2009 he ran to fill Ted Kennedy's Senate seat in a special election. He lost in the Democratic primary. "I think it's hard to jump out of business and run for public office," said Pagliuca, who added that his career politician opponents benefited from better ground games in the short, 12-week election. "You have to defend your record and anything you did." Pagliuca has spoken out against the anti-private equity narrative before. “In every meeting that we have, we say, ‘How can we transform, how can we grow this company?’ Because nobody’s going to want to take the company public or buy the company from you if it’s shrinking," Pagliuca said a week after the 2012 election, when Mitt Romney was famously harangued for his past business dealings at Bain Capital. "It’s the exact opposite of what the election was saying."

APMichigan head coach Brady Hoke reacts on the sideline after a Michigan miscue in the fourth quarter of an NCAA college football game with Notre Dame, in Ann Arbor, Mich., Saturday, Sept. 7, 2013.TheÂ final results of the University of Michigan's September consumer confidence survey are out. The headline index fell to 77.5 in September from August's 82.1 reading, missing economists' consensus estimate of 78.0. However, the number rose from the preliminary estimate of 76.8 published by the University of Michigan earlier this month. The sub-index of economic conditions fell to 92.6 from 95.2 in August, but was better than the preliminary September reading of 91.8. The economic outlook sub-index fell to 67.8 from August's 73.7 reading, but was also better than the September preliminary reading of 67.2. Inflation expectations one year ahead rose to 3.3% from 3.0% in August, while inflation expectations 5-years ahead inched up to 3.0% from 2.9%.
Here's a fantastic chart from IveyBusinessReview that drives home just how rapidly Blackberry collapsed. It was VERY recently than Blackberry had 93% of smartphone sales on Verizon. Granted, the iPhone didn't come to Verizon until 2011 (it originally came out in 2007), but 93% to 6% in about 4 years is a breathtaking drop in such a short time. And based on a quick querry of the BI office, almost nobody realized that their dominance of a major carrier was that huge. IveyBusinessReview
If you aren't morally outraged by the idea of some Americans having ludicrously more money than others and the death of the American dream, then perhaps you will be moved to see that income inequality is actually killing people. And if you're still not bothered, then we'll look at the economic impacts. First, three charts from The Equality Trust, which are "pretty compelling" according to a research note out today fromÂ SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale strategist Albert Edwards. Inequality is killing babies: inequality.org Inequality is killing adults: inequality.org Inequality is causing health and social problems (based on an index that looks at life expectancy, math proficiency and literacy, infant mortality, homicides, imprisonment, teenage births, trust, obesity, mental illness including drug and alcohol addiction, and social mobility): inequality.org It's this last chart in particular that could present economic problems. As noted by Edwards:Â  Set aside any moral or political concerns you may have about rising income inequality Â— worries about poverty, justice, undue political influence or even social mobility. According to [Kemal] Dervis, co-author of the book, the research collected in â€œInequality in America,â€ shows that a growing number of economists suspect that once inequality passes a certain point it may jeopardize economic stability and economic growth. As the book argues, Â“rebalancing of the distribution of income may play a role in unlocking the U.S. economyÂ’s growth potential in a sustainable way.Â” That is exactly the point Warren Buffet, Bill Gross and Stanley Druckenmiller make. You donâ€™t have to be a communist to conclude that high levels of inequality not only adversely affects long-term growth, but also increases the economyâ€™s vulnerability to recession.
Fox NewsIn his first sit-down interview since a marathon, 21-hour Senate floor speech, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) blasted Republicans for being "scared" of defunding the Affordable Care Act through the continuing resolution because of the potential backlash of a government shutdown. Cruz and Fox News' Sean Hannity were discussing an intense Senate floor showdown between Cruz and Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who on Thursday accused Cruz of putting on a "show" and blasted him for being unwilling to move up a vote on the Senate's bill to keep the government funded. "I don't want to speculate about Bob Corker's motivations in coming to the floor and supporting Harry Reid and attacking Mike Lee, which is what he did this afternoon," Cruz told Hannity. "But let me say this generally. A lot of Republicans, they've been here a long time. And they're beaten down. And they're scared that if we stand together on this and if a government shutdown results, that Republicans will be blamed and it's too politically risky.  "And, you know, I just think we need to stand for principle and, you know, some of those Republicans are telling their constituents, they've got to vote for cloture, they're going to vote for giving Harry Reid the power to fund Obamacare. But they're trying to convince their constituents that that's a vote against Obamacare." The Senate will vote on and is expected to pass its version of the continuing resolution on Friday, which will keep the government funded through Nov. 15 and strip of House language that defunds Obamacare.  Cruz has been the source of Republican division on the issue, culminating in his 21-hour talk-a-thon earlier this week that railed against Obamacare. House Republicans were upset with him last week, and right after his speech, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) blasted Cruz's comparison of Obamacare to Nazi Germany. Here's video of Cruz's appearance on "Hannity":

J.C. Penney, whose shares have been hit by concerns that it does not have enough cash to fund its operations going into the holiday season, said on Friday it would sell 84 million shares in a public offering at $9.65 per share. Penney's shares were down 7 percent at $9.69 before the bell. The share sale would increase Penney's shares outstanding by 38 percent, excluding the 12.6 million additional shares the underwriters have the option to buy. The retailer said it expected to end the year with about $1.3 billion in cash, excluding proceeds from the offering. The company said on August 19 that it expected to end the year with $1.5 billion, suggesting it was burning through cash faster than expected - an issue highlighted by several analysts who have a "sell" rating on the stock. "While an equity raise improves (near-term) liquidity, we remain concerned that JCP will continue to burn cash in '14 and beyond," UBS analyst Michael Binetti, who has a "sell" rating on the stock, wrote in a note. JP Morgan analyst Matthew Boss said the offering would dilute earnings per share by 28 percent. Penney announced the offering after the markets closed on Thursday but did not disclose the pricing. COLLAPSING SALES The company, which has a market value of just over $2 billion, has been hit by collapsing sales after a failed attempt in 2012 to go up-market. Penney's offering confirmed an exclusive Reuters report on Wednesday that the company was looking to raise as much as $1 billion in new equity to build its cash reserves. Penney spokeswoman Kristin Hays denied a CNBC report on Thursday that said Chief Executive Mike Ullman had told investors there was no need to raise more money before the end of the fourth quarter, which ends in early February. Penney's shares climbed on the CNBC report, as well as in response to a statement from the company early Thursday that said it anticipated positive comparable sales trends as it comes out of the current quarter, and throughout the holiday quarter. Hays said on Thursday the company had decided to do the share offering now because of all the negative headlines this week about its financial health. The capital raising is in response to uncertainty and is aimed at reassuring suppliers and employees, she said. "This is not because of panic, it's to be prudent," Hays said. She also noted that Penney had opted for a stock issue because it has $5 billion in debt on its books. Penney has been struggling since a failed attempt last year to re-make itself into a trendier store group by getting rid of coupons and much of the merchandise that appealed to its long-time shoppers. Sales fell 25 percent last year, and have continued to fall this fiscal year. Earlier this year, Penney got a $2.25 billion loan arranged by Goldman Sachs &lt;GS.N&gt;, which is the sole book-running manager for the stock offering. A Goldman research note this week said that weak business fundamentals, the need to rebuild inventory of goods popular with its long-time customers and the poor performance of its home goods department would likely put pressure on Penney's liquidity. Penney's shares have been on a wild ride in the past two days: plunging on the Goldman research, and declining further on the Reuters report about a capital raising, before recovering some of those losses on the company statement about trading conditions and the CNBC report. The shares fell again on the share sale announcement on Thursday, continuing their slide on Friday.

Jim Edwards / BIThe August stats on personal income and spending are out, and the numbers were right in line with expectations. Income climbed by 0.4% while spending increased by 0.3%. "A longer work week and higher average hourly earnings pointed to a pickup in private wages and salaries; and faster government hiring did the same for public sector earnings," said UBS's Sam Coffin.

Albert Edwards, the skeptical strategist at Societe Generale, has a lengthy note discussing America's inequality problem. In 10-pages, he cites the works of numerous economists including Joseph Stiglitz and points to the concerns of the wealthy and influential like Warren Buffett, Bill Gross, and Stanley Druckenmiller. Few will question that the U.S. faces an inequality problem. But what are the implications? "[A] growing number of economists suspect that once inequality passes a certain point it may jeopardize economic stability and economic growth," wrote Edwards. "You donâ€™t have to be a communist to conclude that high levels of inequality not only adversely affects long-term growth, but also increases the economyâ€™s vulnerability to recession." But if this is so, then why aren't we already experiencing that instability? Edwards reiterates a conspiracy theory that he's been talking about for a few years. Specifically, he believes the Fed is inflating a housing bubble to create an illusion of wealth among the less wealthy. From his note (emphasis added): When I saw the latest US Case-Shiller data showing house prices surging at a double-digit national pace, I recalled one of the key reasons we had previously identified for why the US Fed may have been so keen to get a house price bubble inflating. We noted back in early 2010 that the Fed was in some economic sense Â‘requiredÂ’ to offset the impact of rising inequality on the economy by generating a house price boom. We wrote: Â“Our US economists make the very interesting point that peaks of income skewness Â– 1929 and 2007 Â– tell us there is something fundamentally unsustainable about excessively uneven income distribution. With a relatively low marginal propensity to consume among the rich, when they receive the vast bulk of income growth, as they have, then the country will face an under-consumption problem. (Marc Faber also cites John HobsonÂ’s work on this same topic from the 1930s).Â” Hence, while governments preside over economic policies that make the very rich even richer, national consumption needs to be boosted in some way to avoid under- consumption ending in outright deflation. In addition, the middle classes also need to be thrown a sop to disguise the fact they are not benefiting at all from economic growth. This is where central banks have played their pernicious part. This, obviously is not sustainable.Â  Here's Edwards (emphasis added): ...Many investors I meet continue to marvel at US labourÂ’s inability to rebuild its wage share of GDP and how dominant capital and profits have become. I believe society will ultimately demand and implement a change. We have already seen a potent grass-roots backlash against cross-border tax arbitrage and tax-havens, which has forced the politicians to react here in the UK. Yet inequality in the US continues to grow. Investors should make no mistake. The anger of the 99% will ultimately not be bought off by yet another central bank inspired housing bubble, engineered to pacify them and divert their attention as their real incomes fall and inequality continues to grow. The current bubble will burst, despite the Fed postponing the event by climbing to ever higher diving boards. All the time rising inequality is draining the swimming pool dry and the crunch when it comes will be ugly... "What society needs to grow in an economically optimal fashion is not equality of outcomes, but equality of opportunity," wrote Edwards. "But with the grotesque distortions of income now prevailing, oneÂ’s lifetime opportunities are so increasingly dominated by what oneÂ’s parents income is that the American dream has increasingly become just that Â–a dream, and an increasingly distant one at that."
Simply put, the bulls use the current price of the S&amp;P 500 and divide it by  estimated forward-looking operating earnings to arrive at the current price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple.  Therefore, based on today’s S&amp;P close of 1698 and consensus estimated 2014 operating earnings of $122, they come up with a reasonable P/E of 13.9 times.  The bears use the same price, but divide it by trailing reported (GAAP) earnings of $90.96, resulting in a P/E of 18.7, at the high end of the range of historical valuations.  In addition, when reported earnings are cyclically smoothed to dampen distortions, the P/E multiple is 19.7. We have three major problems with the way that the majority determines the value of the market.  First, operating earnings differ significantly from earnings calculated in accordance with “generally accepted accounting principles”, commonly referred to as “GAAP” or reported earnings. Operating earnings start with reported earnings, and then add back a number of expenses considered non-recurring, such as severance pay, plant closings, inventory write-downs, opening and closing of facilities and any other number of expenses that corporate managements may choose to write down.  In the past 15 years or so, companies have gotten a lot more creative about what items they can write off, and now a large number of expenses that used to be considered a normal cost of doing business are called “unusual”, even when these write-offs are taken year after year.  In other words, in too many cases what is called operating earnings is pure fiction, and not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Second, the long-term average P/E ratio of 15 is based on trailing reported earnings, not on operating earnings.  Prior to the last 14 years of sequential bubbles, the 71 year average P/E on this basis was 14.5 (rounded to 15).  Operating earnings, as they exist today, did not even exist until after the mid-1980s, when they came into vogue partly as a means of making earnings look better than they would have been under the accepted rules.  Since operating earnings always exceed reported earnings, often by significant amounts, the P/E on operating earnings has averaged three multiples below the P/E on reported earnings.  Therefore, it is likely that if operating earnings had a long history, the average P/E would have been only 12, rather than the 15 on reported earnings.  In that case, even on 2014 operating earnings of $122, the market would still be overvalued. Third, but not least, estimates of year-ahead operating earnings are notoriously unreliable.  In the last 28 years, estimates were too high 76% of the time, often by amounts exceeding 20%.  In May 2008 the estimate for the year was $89, and eventually came in at $50.  At the same time, the 2009 estimate was as high as $110.  The final number was $57.  In sum, the use of forward operating earnings to determine the value of the market can be extremely hazardous.  In our view, the market is selling at 19.7 times cyclically-smoothed reported earnings, about 31% higher than the historical average of 15, let alone the average multiple of 7-to-10 times seen at the bottom of past bear markets.  At present levels the market is already discounting a highly optimistic outlook that leaves it increasingly vulnerable to the serious U.S. and global economic and political risks that can come to the fore at any time.   
BlackBerry's earnings for last quarter are out. There are no surprises, as BlackBerry pretty much pre-announced earnings last week when it said it planned to fire 4,500 employees. On Monday, the company said it had agreed to go private in a $4.7 billion offer from Fairfax Financial. Anyway, here are the numbers: Revenue is down 49% from the same quarter last year. Out of the 3.7 million smartphones sold, BlackBerry said most were models running the older BlackBerry 7 software. It did not say how many new BlackBerry 10 phones it sold. (BlackBerry 10 is the new operating system that was supposed to resurrect the company's handset business.) BlackBerry blamed much of the loss on poor sales of its flagship BlackBerry Z10 phone, which launched in January. That was the first device to run BlackBerry 10, and the phone that was supposed to finally help the company catch up to Apple's iPhone and devices running Google's Android operating system. The company is taking a $934 million charge for unsold Z10 phones. BlackBerry will not hold a conference call with investors and analysts this morning to discuss its earnings report. Here's the full release from BlackBerry:  BlackBerry (NASDAQ:BBRY)(TSX:BB), a world leader in the mobile communications market, today reported second quarter results for the three months ended August 31, 2013 (all figures in U.S. dollars and U.S. GAAP, except where otherwise indicated).  Q2 Highlights:   Q2 Results  Revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2014 was approximately $1.6 billion, down 49% from $3.1 billion in the previous quarter and down 45% from $2.9 billion in the same quarter of fiscal 2013. The revenue breakdown for the quarter was approximately 49% for hardware, 46% for service and 5% for software and other revenue. During the second quarter the company recognized hardware revenue on approximately 3.7 million BlackBerry smartphones. Most of the units recognized are BlackBerry 7 devices, in part because certain BlackBerry 10 devices that were shipped in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 will not be recognized until those devices are sold through to end customers. During the quarter, approximately 5.9 million BlackBerry smartphones were sold through to end customers, which included shipments made prior to the second quarter and which reduced the Company's inventory in the channel.  The GAAP loss from continuing operations for the quarter was $965 million, or $1.84 per share diluted, including a primarily non-cash, pre-tax charge against inventory and supply commitments of approximately $934 million (the "Z10 Inventory Charge"), and pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $72 million related to the Cost Optimization and Resource Efficiency ("CORE") program. This is compared with a GAAP loss from continuing operations of $84 million, or $0.16 per share diluted in the prior quarter and GAAP loss from continuing operations of $229 million, or $0.44 per share diluted, in the same quarter last year.  The adjusted loss from continuing operations for the second quarter was $248 million, or $0.47 per share diluted. The adjusted loss from continuing operations and adjusted diluted loss per share exclude the impact of the Z10 Inventory Charge of approximately $934 million ($666 million after tax) and pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $72 million ($51 million after tax) related to the CORE program incurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2014. These impacts on GAAP loss from continuing operations and diluted loss per share from continuing operations are summarized in the table below.  The total of cash, cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments was $2.6 billion as of August 31, 2013, compared to $3.1 billion at the end of the previous quarter. Cash flow used in operations in the second quarter was approximately $136 million. Uses of cash included intangible asset additions of approximately $268 million and capital expenditures of approximately $112 million.  "We are very disappointed with our operational and financial results this quarter and have announced a series of major changes to address the competitive hardware environment and our cost structure," said Thorsten Heins, President and CEO of BlackBerry. "While our company goes through the necessary changes to create the best business model for our hardware business, we continue to see confidence from our customers through the increasing penetration of BES 10, where we now have more than 25,000 commercial and test servers installed to date, up from 19,000 in July 2013. We understand how some of the activities we are going through create uncertainty, but we remain a financially strong company with $2.6 billion in cash and no debt. We are focused on our targeted markets, and are committed to completing our transition quickly in order to establish a more focused and efficient company." 
REUTERS / Aly SongSunrise in Shanghai, September 27, 2013SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China has formally announced detailed plans for a new free-trade zone (FTZ) in Shanghai, touted as the country's biggest potential economic reform since Deng Xiaoping used a similar zone in Shenzhen to pry open a closed economy to trade in 1978. In an announcement on Friday from the State Council, or cabinet, China said it will open up its largely sheltered services sector to foreign competition in the zone and use it as a testbed for bold financial reforms, including a convertible yuan and liberalized interest rates. Economists consider both areas key levers for restructuring the world's second-largest economy and putting it on a more sustainable growth path. No specific timeline was given for implementing any of the reforms, though these should be carried out within 2-3 years, it said, adding financial liberalization may depend on adequate risk controls. Chinese state media have cautioned that dramatic financial reforms are unlikely this year. An executive at a foreign multinational in Shanghai said his firm was waiting for more clarity. "Is this Shenzen 2.0 heralding the beginning of a new era in trade, or a flash in the pan to simply boost economic confidence?" LOW-HANGING FRUIT Frances Cheung, economist at Credit Agricole CIB, wrote in a note that the initial focus would be on promoting trade. "We note that one thing that is relevant to the RMB (renminbi) is under Point 2, where eligible Chinese banks in the FTZ are allowed to do offshore business, which is not the opening-up of the onshore RMB market as some might have looked for." The zone, formally titled the China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone, is slated to open on Sunday, and China will suspend certain national laws governing the establishment of foreign businesses in the zone effective October 1. In addition to setting goals for improving financial services, trade and governance, the announcement details initiatives covering 18 different industries ranging from shipping and insurance to education and foreign banks. The creation of the zone is hoped to reinvigorate Shanghai's economy, which has begun to lag the rest of China, and help it compete with Hong Kong as a financial centre. In addition, state media have announced that China will soon join negotiations for an agreement on trade in services with the World Trade Organization, and many have speculated the Shanghai FTZ is also an opening move to position China for membership in the U.S.-led Trans Pacific Partnership initiative. The document made no specific mention of allowing access to blocked foreign websites such as Facebook &lt;FB.O&gt; or Twitter from within the zone, as reported in some foreign media. However, a clause did say foreign companies might be allowed to offer "specialized telecommunications services" in the zone, and permission to offer services that break existing Chinese laws might be granted on a case-by-case basis by the state council. MANAGING EXPECTATIONS Hopes that Beijing will follow through on its plans have prompted speculative investment in property in and around the zone and in shares of companies expected to benefit from its construction and operation. Shares in Shanghai International Port Group Co Ltd &lt;600018.SS&gt; and Shanghai Waigaoqiao Free Trade Zone Development Co Ltd &lt;600648.SS&gt; soared from mid-August - at one point, Waigaoqiao shares were up 332 percent before investors began taking profits on Thursday ahead of a week-long holiday. Real estate values have also risen steadily around the zone on expectations that Chinese and foreign companies will move to rent or redevelop existing properties or build new facilities. But economists have warned that while improving the environment for goods and services trade within the zone will be simple, the deeper financial reforms that have excited multinational corporate treasurers will prove more difficult, mainly given the risk of uncontrollable arbitrage across the zone's porous borders and internal political resistance. Michael Klibaner, head of Greater China research at Jones Lang LaSalle, said there will be operational challenges to selling the zone to investors. For example, he noted that while the three geographic areas composing the zone - Waigaoqiao, Yangshan Port and the Pudong International Airport - are technically within Shanghai, they are over an hour's drive from the city center. For example, Yangshan Port, the furthest part of the non-contiguous FTZ, is over 70 km (44 miles) from downtown Shanghai - further than Baltimore, Maryland is from Washington, D.C. "If you think about some of these services, like offering foreign funded health insurance or joint venture travel agencies for outbound tourism, these are customer-facing offerings," said Klibaner. "How are you supposed to reach your customers if you are separated physically from them?" He added that this distance is irrelevant if companies are simply allowed to register in the zone without relocating operations there, but that would only encourage arbitrage. "I can just imagine a parade of armoured trucks full of cash driving into the zone," he said, referring to the possibility that Chinese individuals would use the zone to skirt restrictions on currency conversion. Economists and investors are also nervous about the disappointing history of similar initiatives, in particular the FTZ in Qianhai near Shenzhen, which was promoted as a centre for capital account opening under the sponsorship of outgoing President Hu Jintao. So far, observers say the reforms have been limited, and investor interest has waned. May Yan, an analyst at Barclays Capital in Hong Kong focused on zone coverage, said Friday's announcement did not constitute a "breakthrough". "My concern is that Shanghai will turn out like Qianhai," she said. "Which is nothing, where basically nothing happened."

REUTERS/Kevin LamarqueU.S. President Barack Obama waves to supporters as he arrives to speak about the Affordable Care Act at Prince George's Community College in Largo, Maryland September 26, 2013.Good morning. Here's what you need to know.
REUTERS/ Gary CameronObama's no-negotiation stance on debt ceiling adds uncertainty to endgame with Congress WASHINGTON (AP) â€” This time, President Barack Obama says, he's not budging. This is the confrontational Obama, the "Make my day" president, betting Republicans blink to avoid a government shutdown or a first-ever default of the nation's debts. It's a proposition not without risk and one with a history of last-minute accommodations on both sides. Brinkmanship between Obama and congressional Republicans has often stopped at the precipice's edge. In this round, however, the president and his aides maintain that when it comes to raising the government's borrowing authority and meeting its debt obligations, there's no bargaining. "The entire world looks to us to make sure that the world economy is stable. You don't mess with that," Obama said Thursday. "And that's why I will not negotiate on anything when it comes to the full faith and credit of the United States of America." Still, House Speaker John Boehner says a debt hike must be linked to budget cuts and other programmatic changes. "The president says, 'I'm not going to negotiate,'" Boehner said. "Well, I'm sorry, but it just doesn't work that way." Obama's stance is rooted in experience, politics and a desire to protect himself from similar demands in the remaining three years of his presidency. Obama advisers note that past negotiations have not yielded grand bargains and that the mere threat of default in 2011 rattled the economy, causing a downgrade in U.S. credit. Talks earlier this year to avoid automatic spending cuts known as sequestration also failed. Obama aides also note that Boehner himself eight months ago declared an end to negotiations with Obama, favoring the regular legislative process instead. That process has proved messy for the GOP and senior White House aides insist that in a standoff, Republicans will be perceived as the unreasonable party. And the White House is convinced any concession would place the president in the position of having to bargain again and again when the next debt ceiling looms. "Every poll I've seen suggests that while no one escapes cleanly from a shutdown, the GOP would bear the brunt," former senior White House counselor and Obama adviser David Axelrod said. "The bigger danger for the president is to put himself in a position to be constantly held hostage. First they want an arm. Then they want a leg. It's unsustainable." The likelihood of a shutdown Oct. 1 and the threat of a credit default in the ensuing weeks have mounted as conservative Republicans push to use a stopgap spending bill and an increase in the debt ceiling as leverage against Obama's 3-year-old health care law. House Republican leaders, meanwhile, want to attach other provisions to the debt ceiling, including approval of the Keystone XL pipeline and provisions blocking pollution regulations. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., on Thursday demanded the GOP-controlled House simply send the Senate unencumbered spending and debt ceiling bills. "There's no need for conversations," Reid said. "We've spoken loudly and clearly, and we have the support of the president of the United States. And that's pretty good." The Pew Research Center, however, found nearly 6 out of 10 Americans want politicians they side with to be more willing to engage in talks. And the public split about evenly in the Pew poll on who would be responsible if the government shut down, with 39 percent blaming Republicans and 36 percent Obama and much of the rest blaming both. "The president may not be playing this just for this set and this match," said Patrick Griffin, the White House legislative director under President Bill Clinton. "As his tenure goes on and his legacy looms larger, he might not be as poll sensitive as he might be otherwise." White House aides say Obama is still willing to negotiate over a long-term spending deal, just not as part of raising the debt ceiling. But the opportunity for that could be short-lived, too. The Senate version of the short-term spending bill would set up another possible government shutdown as soon as Nov. 16. What's more, lines in the sand have blurred before. Obama ran for re-election vowing to increase taxes on individuals making more than $200,000. Republicans insisted they would not raise taxes at all. In the end, both settled on a hike on incomes above $400,000. Most recently, Obama altered course on Syria, at first determined to launch missile strikes against its regime, then seeking congressional support before taking a diplomatic path aimed at destroying Syria's chemical stockpile. The White House also sees the current showdown as an opportunity to cast the Republican Party in the image of Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, a leader in the effort to kill Obama's health care law. "They have allowed Ted Cruz to be their face, write their charter, and steer their ship," said senior White House adviser Dan Pfeiffer. "That is a decision that has real consequences for how the American people view the Republican Party as we head into this debate." Still, if the White House is eager to stitch Cruz' name to the Republican Party banner, many Senate Republicans were doing their best to distance themselves from the Texan and his aggressive tactics. Indeed, as much as Republicans dislike the health care law, many Republicans argue that seeking to kill it is fruitless as long as Obama is president and Democrats control the Senate. ___ Follow Jim Kuhnhenn on Twitter: http://twitter.com/jkuhnhenn Copyright (2013) Associated Press.

Over the past week, following the Federal Reserve's surprise decision to refrain from tapering quantitative easing last Wednesday, bond funds snapped their 8-week streak of outflows as investors piled $4.5 billion into the asset class, the largest weekly inflow in five months. Meanwhile, equity funds saw $1.5 billion in outflows. U.S. equity funds in particular were hit hard, losing $7.4 billion to redemptions. Europe, however, remained hot, as investors poured another $2.3 billion into European equities. Below is a complete breakdown of this week's flows, via BofA Merrill Lynch chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett: Asset Class Flows Bonds: $4.5bn inflows (largest in 5 months) (ends 8w outflow streak) Equities: $1.5bn outflows after last weekâ€™s record inflows (note $4.3bn ETF outflows vs $2.7bn LO inflows this week) Commodities: $0.4bn outflows MMF: $16bn inflows ($68bn inflows over past 2 months) Equity Flows EM: $1.9bn inflows (all via ETFs - EEM); inflows mostly via GEM funds Europe: 13 straight weeks of inflows ($2.3bn) (longest inflow streak since 2006) Japan: $0.8bn inflows (3 straight weeks) US: $7.4bn outflows after monster $17bn ETF inflows last week Fixed Income Flows First inflows ($0.6bn) to EM debt funds in 18 weeks! First inflows (albeit small $59mn) to Muni funds in 18 weeks! Largest inflows ($1.0bn) to IG bond funds in 17 weeks! Largest Inflows ($4.0bn) to HY bond funds in 9 weeks 66 straight weeks of inflows to floating-rate debt ($0.4bn) 24 straight weeks of outflows from TIPS ($0.6bn)
Business spending has been a real drag through the entirety of the recovery. Â The so-called â€œcorporate savings glutâ€ has left many wondering if businesses will spend and invest and drive the economic machine like they usually do. Â And in the midst of a slowing in government expenditures and anemic consumer spending this is a time when the business sector is much needed. Â So this comment from David Rosenbergâ€™s latest really jumped out at me: â€œThe good news, however, was that the key leading indicator for business spending â€“ core capex goods orders â€“ bounced 1.5% in August. Â Furthermore, the three month trend of core capex orders â€“ one of the reliable metrics gauging the US macro pulse â€“ is running at a healthy 8.4% annual rate.â€ Rosenbergâ€™s right. Â This is hugely important at this point in the cycle when the government deficit is declining and the consumer still doesnâ€™t look 100% healthy. Â For now, the trend in business spending looks very healthy. Â Letâ€™s hope it keeps up because if it doesnâ€™t itâ€™s likely that the economy wonâ€™t hang in there for long.

AP Goldman Sachs' Alec Phillips nails it in a new note to clients today. You should want to see a government shutdown in Washington: It would be a mistake to interpret a shutdown as implying a greater risk of a debt limit crisis, in our view. It would not be surprising to see a more negative market reaction to a shutdown than would be warranted by the modest macroeconomic effect it would have. We suspect that many market participants would interpret a shutdown as implying a greater risk of problems in raising the debt limit. This is not unreasonable, but we would see it differently. If a shutdown is avoided, it is likely to be because congressional Republicans have opted to wait and push for policy concessions on the debt limit instead. By contrast, if a shutdown occurs, we would be surprised if congressional Republicans would want to risk another difficult situation only a couple of weeks later. The upshot is that while a shutdown would be unnecessarily disruptive, it might actually ease passage of a debt limit increase. Bottom line, as we argued earlier this week: A brief government shutdown is not that big of a deal. But a debt ceiling breach could be a catastrophe. A shutdown makes the latter less likely to happen. So pray for that. UPDATE: Read Noam Scheiber at The New Republic on why John Boehner may have to shut down the government to get out of his situation alive.
It's well-known that job creation has been pretty mediocre, basically ever since the recession ended. Every time we get a couple months in a row, and some optimism that a new, accelerated pace of growth is here, the numbers inevitably disappoint. But on the flipside, the pace of layoffs is stunningly low. Here's a look at weekly initial jobless claims vs. the total number of people who are employed. With the exception of recent bubble peaks, we're basically at the best levels in decades. FRED Scott Sumner at The Money Illusion expresses his amazement and confusion at these numbers: Iâ€™m not going to redraw the graph, but with todayâ€™s numbers (308,000 on the 4 week average) we have fallen below the 0.1% level, meaning that fewer than 1/1000ths of Americans now file for unemployment comp each week.Â  Thatâ€™s not just boom conditions, itâ€™s peak of boom conditions.Â  The only other times this occurred since 1969 (when unemployment was 3.5%) were just a few weeks at the peak of the 2000 tech boom and a few weeks at the peak of the 2006 housing boom.Â  In other words, the puzzle is now even greater than 6 weeks ago, as the unemployment rate is still at recession levels (7.3%.)Â  Something very weird is going on in the labor markets. ... My hunch is that these new numbers portend further declines in the unemployment rate in the months ahead. Â Which is also a puzzle given that RGDP growth is about 2% in recent years. As Scott puts it, something "weird" is going on.
Flickr/jeffanddaynaSo we know that the markets don't (yet) care about the debt ceiling or any other fiscal nonsense happening in DC. And admittedly, investors have good reason to be inured from the nonsense, and to assume that in the end it will get worked out, probably at the very last second. In the end, someone will "blink" right? Well of course, the whole notion of one side blinking comes from the idea of a staring contest. Both sides look keep their eyes open until it hurts, and before anything bad happens, one side agrees it can't take it anymore. But the problem with applying the blink metaphor to DC is that you don't have two sides. You have the White House, the Senate, The House GOP Leadership, the House GOP grassroots, and the emergent liberal wing of the Democratic party which doesn't want Obama to negotiate, even if he were so inclined. And each one of these players has a role. The most volatile dynamic exists not between The White House and GOP Leadership, but between House GOP Leadership, and the conservative GOPers in the House. If you want to become less sanguine about things, read Jake Sherman and John Bresnahan at POLITICO, who explain that House GOP leadership is banking on some nebulous "Plan C" after their first two ideas to avert a standoff have gone nowhere. It's pretty hard to suss out what Plan C is, but it's obvious that House GOP leaders have no real power over their base, nor even the ability to pander to them well. This isn't to say it will all end in disaster, but anyone who thinks that one of the "two"sides will give in at the end doesn't appreciate the dynamics of it all.
You have to be impressed by the British Pound. It wasn't that long ago that everyone was making "pound getting pounded" puns, and it was universally agreed upon that the UK economy was the sickest in the developed world. And like everywhere else it is pretty mediocre. But 2013 has been a huge turnaround year, in part due to the improving fortunes of all of Europe, and also over increased optimism with respect to monetary policy. Today the Bank of England's Mark Carney came out and said there was no interest in more QE, and that send the pound shooting up, but actually it's been on an amazing run for months. From FinViz: FinViz Meanwhile, suddenly it's the US with seemingly inconsistent monetary policy, and a government eager to shoot itself in the foot and chip away at the dollar's dominant global status.
ShutterstockGood morning! The US is one day closer to a government shutdown, and markets are lower. The selling isn't too dramatic, although it began at about 3 AM ET. European stocks are lower as well. Germany is down 0.2%. Italy is down 0.1%. Asian stocks were mixed. The big themes: The government shutdown/debt ceiling, which have yet to have a real impact on markets. And economic data, which will come hot and heavy next week, with a slew of numbers including non-farm payrolls and various PMI numbers.
