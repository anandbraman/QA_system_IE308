REUTERS/Carlos BarriaSHANGHAI (Reuters) -Â China's securities regulator could streamline its approvals process for some initial public offerings (IPO) by next January, the regulator said on Saturday, mapping out reform measures. But firms would still need to wait forÂ ChinaÂ to restart theÂ IPOÂ market, frozen since October last year after authorities suspended listings in a bid to stamp out equity market fraud. "After the announcement of these opinions, there would need to be around one month of preparatory work before firms could complete the necessary procedures," theÂ ChinaÂ Securities Regulatory CommissionÂ (CSRC) said on its website. "We predict around 50 companies may be able to complete their registration procedures forÂ IPOÂ by January next year." There have been prior reports of theÂ IPOÂ drought coming to and end, but Saturday's statement gives the strongest hint thatÂ ChinaÂ is contemplating the resumption of mainland listings. The reforms were a key step in overhauling a lengthy approval process and moving it to a system based on registration to give the market a more prominent role, the regulator added. "After our sector audit, when and how new shares are issued will be under market constraints and will be independently decided, while pricing of shares will more closely reflect true levels of supply and demand," it said in the statement. The reform will pullÂ China'sÂ IPOÂ vetting process closer to those of developed countries, where firms register their IPOs and face a rigorous audit before listing. ChinaÂ also announced details of a trial run for Chinese-listed firms to issue preferred shares, the government said in a separate statement on its website. Investors have long complained that too many listed firms are required to sacrifice profits for wider policy aims. Many saw use of preferred shares as a way to dilute government influence and boost the value of other investors' holdings. IPOÂ reform would not mean deregulation, the regulator cautioned, saying it would toughen monitoring of the sector and step up punishments for non-compliance.

Wikimedia CommonsTaiwan's manufacturing purchasing managers index for November jumped to 53.4 from 53.0 in October, the strongest improvement since March 2012. Growth of both output and new orders both hit 20-month highs. The island nation also saw its second-strongest expansion of payroll numbers since April 2011. Still, Taiwan is surrounded by countries where demand is flagging, and HSBC economist Ronald Man says the Taiwanese Central Bank is likely to maintain an accommodative stance. “Further improvements in Taiwan's manufacturing conditions suggest that the trade-dependent economy will end the year on a strong note. Stronger new orders and output have filtered into higher employment, which will help support household consumption. But there is insufficient evidence that external demand, especially from Mainland China, has fully recovered. Therefore policymakers in Taipei will likely maintain an accommodative stance for the time being.” Chart: HSBC Full release »  
REUTERS/Sheng Li HSBC China PMI came in at 50.8 in November. This was the second highest reading in eight months. This beat expectations for a reading of 50.5. And the number is modestly lower than the 50.9 print in October. November saw marginal job shedding and backlogs of work continued to increase. A reading below 50 shows that the manufacturing sector is contracting. "Chinaâ€™s manufacturing sector kept relatively steady growth momentum in November, as the final manufacturing PMI was revised up from the flash"reading on the back of faster new business gains," said Hongbin Qu, chief economist, China at HSBC in a press release. "However, the renewed contraction of employment and the slower pace of restocking activities call for a continuation of accommodative policy. The modest inflationary pressures leave room to do so." We got the official number yesterday, and that showed Chinese manufacturing hold steady at 51.4. The official survey showed that large enterprises have shown strength while small enterprises continue to struggle, notes Societe Generale's Wei Yao. Here's a look at how China's manufacturing sector has been shaping up: HSBC/Markit EconomicsThis is in keeping with the fact that the HSBC survey, which has a larger exposure to small and medium enterprises, has underperformed the official survey for eight months.

Chasing Ice Morgan Stanley's Global Strategy team is out with its 2014 outlook titled: Fertile Soils, Rising Divergences. In it, Morgan Stanley says that they generally favor stocks over bonds, but that we're now in the second half of this big boom, and that future gains will now depend more on growth, as opposed to liquidity. This is a similar idea as that expressed by Nomura, which argued that the end of "end of the world risk" would require a search for real growth, rather than just gains brought on by climbing out of the gutter. Here are Morgan Stanley's 10 big macro strategy ideas. These are their words: -- European Equities: Long Financials (SX7P, SXIP); Short Cyclicals (SXNP, SXPP, SX4P) -- Asia Equities: Long Nikkei, HSCEI, Kospi, Taiex; Short CNX Nifty, JCI, SET, FBMKLCI, FSSTI -- US equities: Healthcare over Staples; Tech over Discretionary; Chemicals over Industrials and Energy -- Long US credit versus European Credit (Long US CDX HY versus Short iTraxx XOver) -- Long USD interest rate volatility (Long 2y10y swaption straddles) -- Long Spain over Italy sovereign bonds (10y Bonos versus BTPs) -- Long US IG long-duration discount bonds versus UST -- Short EM sovereign credit (Short EM CDX) -- Long new-issue CLO equity  -- Long USDJPY, Long USDRUB
Flickr/doegox  Korea's HSBC manufacturing PMI for November improved to 50.4 from 50.2. Output and new orders went nowhere, though export orders ticked higher. Input price inflation climbed. HSBC economist Ronald Man commented: “Korea's manufacturing conditions improved for the second consecutive month. Stronger employment   growth will support household income and private consumption. But in the absence of even stronger output and new orders, the recovery will likely remain gradual. Therefore policymakers will likely maintain an   accommodative stance for the time being. We expect the Bank of Korea to hold rates at 2.50%, before delivering a 25bp hike in 3Q 2014.” Here's the tale of the tape: HSBC Full release: The HSBC South Korea Purchasing Managers’ IndexTM (PMI®) – a composite indicator designed to provide a single-figure snapshot of the health of the manufacturing sector – rose marginally to 50.4 in November, up from 50.2 in October, signaling a slight improvement in operating conditions. Whilst the PMI posted only just above the 50.0 no-change mark separating growth from contraction, this was nevertheless the highest reading in six months. Output growth slowed to virtual stagnation in November, as the seasonally adjusted Index registered only fractional growth. That said, the Index posted above the 50.0 no-change mark for the second successive month, following a four-month sequence of readings signaling contraction. Respondents cited increased smartphone sales and improvements in the automobile industry due to the settlement of strikes as key drivers. Like output, new orders also registered such meagre growth as to broadly indicate stagnation in November. Anecdotal evidence suggested the impact of an expansion in foreign demand, and consequent rise in new export orders, was tempered by a contraction of domestic demand. Conversely, new export orders grew at a solid pace in November, though the rate of growth eased from October’s 31-month high. Some panellists attributed the latest increase to an expansion in demand in key foreign markets, such as China, South East Asia and Japan.Like new orders from abroad, South Korean manufacturing employment bucked the trends seen in output, total new orders and backlogs, registering solid growth in November. Payroll numbers rose at the sharpest pace since May, and a number of respondents attributed the latest increase to an expectation of higher production levels in 2014. Anticipation of output growth in 2014 was similarly cited as a reason for higher purchasing activity in November. The quantity of purchases rose at the sharpest pace since April, with gains also linked by a number of panelists to new export order growth.Input prices rose at a moderate pace in November, following a marginal fall in October. A number of respondents attributed the latest month’s price inflation to increases in raw material importing costs. In contrast, output prices fell for the second successive month, though the pace of decline eased marginally from October.

However, in their efforts to chase gains, investors may flood into the markets and boosts prices even higher. "2014 may finally be the year individual investors, as a group, begin to buy stocks in contrast to the net selling they have done since the bull market began nearly five years ago," said LPL Financial's Jeff Kleintop. "The five-year trailing annualized return for stocks has been weak, especially compared to bonds, in recent years. However, as 2014 gets underway, the one-, three-, and five-year trailing annualized returns for the S&amp;P 500 will all be in the double digits for the first time this business cycle" "Our analysis of history shows that it is the five-year return that individual investors tend to chase, based on net inflows to U.S. stock funds," argued Kleintop. "As of March 6, 2014, five years from the bear market low in the S&amp;P 500 — even assuming no additional growth in the stock market between now and then — the five-year annualized return may have exceeded bonds’ 5% return by 20%. This may prompt many investors to reconsider the role of stocks in their portfolios, especially as interest rates rise and bond performance lags."
Robert ShillerBERLIN (Reuters) - An American who won this year's Nobel Prize for economics believes sharp rises in equity and property prices could lead to a dangerous financial bubble and may end badly, he told a German magazine. Robert Shiller, who won the esteemed award with two other Americans for research into market prices and asset bubbles, pinpointed the U.S. stock market and Brazilian property market as areas of concern. "I am not yet sounding the alarm. But in many countries stock exchanges are at a high level and prices have risen sharply in some property markets," Shiller told Sunday's Der Spiegel magazine. "That could end badly," he said. "I am most worried about the boom in the U.S. stock market. Also because our economy is still weak and vulnerable," he said, describing the financial and technology sectors as overvalued. He had also looked at "drastically" higher house prices in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo in Brazil in the last five years. "There, I felt a bit like in the United States of 2004," he said, adding he was hearing arguments about investment opportunities and a growing middle class that he had heard in the United States around the year 2000. The collapse of the U.S. housing market helped trigger the 2008-2009 global financial crisis. "Bubbles look like this. And the world is still very vulnerable to a bubble," he said. Bubbles are created when investors do not recognize when rising asset prices get detached from underlying fundamentals. (Reporting by Madeline Chambers; Editing by Mark Potter)
Joe WEisenthalI'm changing my mind about Bitcoin. I used to think it was a joke or at best a currency for clowns. Now, I no longer think that. Now, I don't know what its future is. Here, let me explain. I've gone through two phrases writing about the "crypto-currency" called Bitcoin. I first started paying close attention to it early this year. In April, during its first big mega-spike, I wrote Bitcoin Has No Intrinsic Value, And Will Never Be A Threat To Fiat Currency. Then the price of Bitcoin crashed, and I kind of lost interest. Then a few weeks ago, as the price of Bitcoin started exploding again, I wrote a post that earned me all kinds of trolls and anger on the Internet. That post was titled Bitcoin Is A Joke.  That post seriously caused a major ruckus. Everyone on the Bitcoin message boards freaked out. Someone tried turning me into a meme. Joe Weisenthal Other folks, like Max Keiser, eagerly anticipated the moment that I would commit suicide on live TV. Max Keiser Since then, Bitcoin has exploded in price much more, going from about $300 per coin to over $1,000, and even hitting $1,200 at one point. Now there's always a danger in changing your mind on something after a gigantic rally, because that looks like "capitulation" and that usually happens at the top, and then you're made to look like a fool twice. First you end up looking like a fool for being negative at the bottom. Then you look like a fool for changing your mind at the top. You see this kind of thing happen all the time, because humans are herders, and it's difficult to have contrary opinions, especially in markets where the price moves against you daily. But I'll say at the outset (and this defense is going to end up being pointless) I don't think that that applies here. First of all, I've never really expressed a view on Bitcoin's "price." The whole thing seemed like a house of cards to me. And at this point, I still have no idea whether it will go up or down. If I had to guess, I'd still guess that the price of a bitcoin is still much more likely to go to zero than to have any durable value out into the future. At this point, I have zero idea what a "fair" price for Bitcoin is. But I'm less convinced that Bitcoin is for clowns or that the whole thing is a house of cards destined to disappear at the first mention of wind. It might be a house of cards! I just don't think I know. The more I've thought about Bitcoin though, the less valid some of my earlier objections to it seem, which is why in the interest of intellectual honesty and being someone who takes into account new evidence when presented with it, I'm writing this post now. First of all, it's wrong to say that Bitcoin has no value. There's prima facie evidence that this is untrue. If you want to buy weed on the Internet, Bitcoin serves a useful purpose. First you convert your U.S. dollars into Bitcoin, which is a totally legal thing to do. With those Bitcoins you now have the ability to anonymously purchase anything you want on the Internet (like pot). The seller, the recipient of those bitcoins, can anonymously sell marijuana to you, and then convert those bitcoins back to U.S. dollars — again a totally legal action. Basically, both the buyer and the seller each engage in one activity that could theoretically be tracked (converting dollars into bitcoins and vice versa) while the actual illicit action (the selling of marijuana) is done in a system that is theoretically impossible to track. It's easy to dismiss the foundations of a currency that provides the most value to people engaging in illegal action, but that's really not a good counterargument. Illicit action is a part of the economy and will always be with us. A protocol for buyer and seller to connect online anonymously is a useful thing for people in that economy, and so that alone offers at least some value to Bitcoin. Two other arguments against Bitcoin, which I've stated in the past, are that the currency is too volatile to be a useful medium of exchange. And that it's also deflationary in the sense that if you assume the price is going to keep going up, then you have no incentive to ever spend your bitcoins, thus preventing the Bitcoin economy from becoming a vibrant thing. But both of these counter-arguments have flaws. Let's go back to the marijuana sale. If you're scouring The Silk Road, you're most likely looking to pay roughly the "street value" for the pot your buying, plus perhaps some premium for being able to purchase the product from the comfort of your own home. You probably don't really care what the bitcoin price of the pot is, just as long as it's pretty close to what you consider a fair value for it in U.S. Dollars. The bitcoin price is kind of a distraction — remember its main purpose is so you can complete a transaction with the veil of anonymity, which is something that's pretty much impossible using existing technologies on the Internet. According to PriceOfWeed.com, the average price for an oz. of high quality weed is $352.88 in New York. PriceOfWeed So the bitcoin price of an ounce of high-grade pot should be around 0.3 BTC. If I'm the buyer I don't really care if yesterday the price was 0.2 or 0.5 or 0.1 or 1. The only thing that matters is that right now the bitcoin price is roughly in line with what I want to pay in USD. Then the only thing that matters is whether I can switch my USD bitcoin in a timely manner, and make the transaction. And then for the seller, the key thing is to be able to quickly unload the bitcoin for U.S. dollars, so that he or she isn't taking any big risk on bitcoin fluctuations (after all, selling weed is risky enough. You don't want a big currency risk as well). Provided the market is liquid enough, and the transaction infrastructure is robust enough, both the buyer and the seller should be able to conduct a mutually agreeable transaction at a fair U.S. dollar-based price, with Bitcoin simply providing the anonymity needed for the actual swap.  The same argument applies to the deflationary aspect of Bitcoin. If I'm buying weed online, what do I care if others are hoarding it, or if the price has gone up five times in the last day? So long as at the current price, the seller and me are able to come to a mutually agreeable price when translated back into U.S. dollars, the price rise just isn't that big of an impediment. In fact, the price rise might actually be helpful (more on this later). Even if you don't think drugs, online gambling, and other illegal activity is enough to sustain a "currency," the same principle applied above could apply to something more important: money laundering or circumventing capital controls. This is what the excitement about Bitcoin in China is all about. In the Bitcoin community, there's tons of talk about how the future of Bitcoin is in China, and there does seem to be tons of trading volume happening there. Here's the potential: China has lots of rich people, but a fragile banking system, and strict capital controls, meaning it's difficult to get your wealth out of the country. One way rich people get their wealth out of the country is by laundering it through Macau. Mamta Badkar wrote a great explainer of how this works. Basically, your Chinese millionaire gives millions of dollars to a "junket" operator in the mainland. That junket operator then provides them with millions of dollars worth of chips at a casino in Macau. The millionaire then plays numerous hands of some game (probably baccarat) then at the end of the session cashes in the chips in Macau's currency, the Pataca. Then those Patacas are deposited into a bank in Macau, and voila, the millionaire has just escaped China's capital controls, having successfully moved millions outside of the Chinese banking system. Bitcoin, theoretically, promises an even easier path to do this. Rich person buys a bunch of bitcoins, transfers them to a Bitcoin wallet associated with a financial institution outside of China, sells the bitcoins into some new currency, and then voila.  Economist Tyler Cowen wrote a long post about Bitcoin and its potential in China last week: Right now, you can think of the value of Bitcoin being set in the same way that the value of an export license might be set through bids.  If/when China fully liberalizes capital flows, the value of Bitcoin likely will fall.  A lot.  To the extent the shadow market value of the yuan rises, and approaches the level of the current quasi-peg, the value of Bitcoin will fall, by how much is not clear.  Or maybe getting money out through Hong Kong (or Shanghai) will become easier and again the value of Bitcoin would fall.  If Beijing shuts down BTC China, the main broker, which by the way accounts for about 1/3 of all Bitcoin transactions in the world, the value of Bitcoin very likely will fall.  A lot.  You will recall that the Chinese government shut down the virtual currency QQ in 2009; admittedly stopping Bitcoin could prove harder but still they could thwart or limit it. If you are long Bitcoin for any appreciable amount of time, it seems you are betting that the Chinese economy will do poorly and capital controls will remain.  Then more people will be increasingly desperate to get more money out of the country.  Or you may be betting that the Chinese use of Bitcoin to launder money will increase due to the mere spread of the idea, through social contagion.  According to this source, the value of Bitcoin is up by a factor of 66 this year in China. Now, earlier I mentioned that the rising price of Bitcoin, rather than being a hindrance, could actually be helpful. Here's why. See, while everyone talks about Bitcoin, there are actually a ton of crypto-currencies. The website CoinMarketCap.com lists 42 different ones, and helpfully lists the total "market cap" of each. The "market cap" is just the price of each coin multiplied by the number of outstanding coins there are for each. Here's a look at the top eight among them. Bitcoin, at over $10 billion, is the biggest. Feathercoin, at over $19 million, is still pretty substantial. CoinMarketCap Now each one of these coin systems are pretty similar, but they have slightly different characteristics. The second biggest one is Litecoin, which advertises that transactions are faster, and that the mining system is fairer than bitcoins. Theoretically, any one of these would suffice if you're a rich person in China looking to get your money outside the border. But in practice, several of these wouldn't suffice. For you to get your money out of China you need to be able to buy coins in size, and then be confident that once you've switched them to a wallet outside of the country, that you'd be able to sell those coins in size for roughly the same price. If you wanted to move $1 million worth of Feathercoin, you'd be trying to move over 5% of the entire Feathercoin market. It's highly unlikely you'd be able to find that kind of liquidity in any reasonable period of time. You'd be taking a gigantic risk that when you wanted to sell your Feathercoin, that there would be no buyers, and you'd be totally screwed. Now that Bitcoin has, notionally, billions of dollars in the ecosystem, moving $1 million (just ~1,000 bitcoins) is less likely to cause any kind of splash. You can probably obtain the coins and sell them without much disruption. So although theoretically the competing coins can technically do the job of getting past the border, you really need the network effects of a system with a high "market cap" to make it work. So in a sense, the rising price makes it easier for the whole system to operate. Rather than being discouraging to the Bitcoin ecosystem, it enables it, because there's enough money in the system to absorb the needs of buyers and sellers doing transactions. Felix Salmon wrote a post titled Waiting for Bitcoin to get Boring in which he argued that Bitcoin bulls should be more excited by long periods with little volatility rather than the periods like recently where the price goes ballistic. But while that seems intuitive if you think of Bitcoin like a "currency" that needs stability, it doesn't necessarily jibe with the thinking above. Higher and higher bitcoin prices enable transactions in size. It's because Bitcoin has gone parabolic, and the number of dollars associated with it are now over $10 billion that it could become a plausible avenue for rich Chinese to start thinking of it as a way for them to get money out of the country. Rather than the high price being a hindrance, the high price expands the market. There are all kinds of reasons to be compelled by anti-Bitcoin and to be deeply skeptical. The Economist had a great piece Saturday about how there's a huge and growing technical strain on the whole Bitcoin network that could cause an implosion. And the cult-like fanaticism of Bitcoin bulls spewing warmed-over goldbug cliches about the instability of fiat currency or the demise of the Fed should make anyone skeptical. If the advocates of Bitcoin are telling you to blow your brains out, it's a good heuristic to think that what they're advocating is a total fraud which you can safely ignore. But while that might work most times, it's not necessarily always right. Then there are charts like this comparing Bitcoin to the famous South Sea Bubble, which Mebane Faber put together. Mebane Faber It's hard not to look at that and conclude that obviously Bitcoin is a bubble that will go to zero. But there is at least the possibility that what we're seeing is network effects pricing themselves in real time, and acting like any other Internet protocol (or company) whose value grows like crazy the more people who are using it. If you were able to put a "value" on Napster in its early days as more and more people put their files on it, the chart might have looked similar. Does that mean Napster was a speculative bubble? No (although eventually it crashed for other reasons). Right now, Bitcoin has real-world value to people because there are speculators who will supply bitcoin on demand (almost) and buy bitcoin in a liquid manner, allowing people to conduct online transactions that they might not otherwise be able to using a traditional currency. If the speculators ever lose interest (which might happen if the price stops going parabolic) then the people who use it for real transactions are cooked. Real currencies, backed by a central bank, and whose value is the function of laws, don't have to worry about this. People have to hold dollars in the U.S. no matter what (to pay taxes, to use the banking system, etc.) so the speculators aren't that important for the conduct of actual transactions. Whether the speculators will stick around Bitcoin, and always ensure that people using it for real purposes (to buy drugs, to gamble, to buy things with no fees, to circumvent capital controls) can swap in and out of it is an open question. But it's an interesting question with real-world ramifications that is more intriguing than I first thought.
Earlier today, Bitcoin was around $1,200. Currently? It's below $1,000. Here's the chart from ClarkMoody.com. Bitcoin
Stocks are at all-time highs, and anyone invested in the market has reason to be happy. But that's just it. It's only the people who are investing who have gotten a piece of this 3.5-year-long bull market, which has seen the S&amp;P 500 explode 170% According to Gallup's annual Economics and Personal Finance survey, which was conducted in April, just 52% of Americans are personally or jointly with a spouse invested in the stock market. This is the lowest level since at least 1998. Gallup Gallup attributes this low ownership rate to the high unemployment rate. "Between 1998 and 2008, a period of relatively modest unemployment, Gallup, with one exception, found at least 60% of Americans reporting that they owned stock," said Gallup's Lydia Saad. "That changed in April 2009, at the same time the nation's economy was descending into recession and experiencing a near-doubling of the unemployment rate compared with April 2008. By April 2012, with unemployment still elevated at 8.1%, stock ownership had fallen to 53%. It remains at about that level today, perhaps indicating that the nation's current 7.5% unemployment rate, while improved, is still too high to support broader stock ownership." Gallup's survey revealed that 61% of those employed were invested in stocks compared to the just 41% of those not employed. Pew Research CenterThis inability to invest only adds to the feeling of haves versus have-nots in America. The Pew Research Center conducted a similar survey in March and found that just 45% of Americans had money in the market. Pew also uncovered significant demographic patterns. "Our survey found that stock ownership was sharply differentiated by age, race and socioeconomic status," said Pew's Drew DeSilver. "More than half (55%) of whites, for instance, said they were invested in stocks, compared with 28% of blacks and 17% of Hispanics. 77% of college graduates reported being invested in stocks (versus less than half of non-graduates), and 80% of people with incomes of $75,000 or more, compared with 55% of people with incomes of $30,000 to $75,000 and just 15% of people with incomes below $30,000." In short, people with money in stocks "tend to be white, wealthy and more educated." We can't, however, ignore te possibility that the willingness to invest has also been low. The breathtaking collapse of the stock market from Fall 2008 into Spring 2009 certainly left a bad taste in the mouths of investors. But that bad memory may finally be fading. "2014 may finally be the year individual investors, as a group, begin to buy stocks in contrast to the net selling they have done since the bull market began nearly five years ago," said LPL Financial's Jeff Kleintop. "The five-year trailing annualized return for stocks has been weak, especially compared to bonds, in recent years. However, as 2014 gets underway, the one-, three-, and five-year trailing annualized returns for the S&amp;P 500 will all be in the double digits for the first time this business cycle" "Our analysis of history shows that it is the five-year return that individual investors tend to chase, based on net inflows to U.S. stock funds," argued Kleintop. "As of March 6, 2014, five years from the bear market low in the S&amp;P 500 — even assuming no additional growth in the stock market between now and then — the five-year annualized return may have exceeded bonds’ 5% return by 20%. This may prompt many investors to reconsider the role of stocks in their portfolios, especially as interest rates rise and bond performance lags." For the sake of those just re-entering the market, let's hope the bull market doesn't end anytime soon. Because the only thing worse than not making money on the way up is losing money on the way down.

Imgur A college student quickly made over $24,000 just by waving this sign on TV. Here's the deal: Yesterday on ESPN's "College GameDay" (an ESPN college football show that's filmed at a different college campus each week) some student held the above sign that has both the Bitcoin logo and a QR code. A QR code is a visual representation of any kind of information (frequently a URL for a website). In this case, the code represented a Bitcoin wallet. On Reddit, Bitcoin fans managed to enhance the QR code from the screen in order to identify his wallet, so that people could donate money to him. Here's one enhancement from Redditor DanielTaylor: Â Reddit That allowed people to figure out his wallet address, which is:Â 1HiMoMgBaAikFHgAt3M4YJtetp4HrnsiXu. The image made it onto the front page of Reddit and quickly spread across the Bitcoin community. And perhaps sensing an opportunity to turn this into a huge publicity stunt and free ad for Bitcoin (with articles like this one!) the community sent him donations. The guy received 100 transactions totalling more than 22 bitcoins. At current prices above $1,100 per bitcoin, the kid has made over $24,000. Blockchain.info A crucial thing about how Bitcoin works is that all transactions are made public, and you can see the number of bitcoins associated with each wallet. What you can't see, however, is the actual person associated with the wallet. Needless to say, the Bitcoin community was floored.

Margin CallHappy December!  We hope you're well rested and no longer in a Thanksgiving food coma. You're going to need all the energy you can muster for the week ahead, as it's jam-packed with economic data. And actually that starts tonight! As it's the first day of the month, today is PMI Day, when manufacturing data from all around the world starts coming out, starting first with Asia. Early tomorrow morning we get European manufacturing data, followed by the US ISM at 10:00 AM ET on Monday. Also tomorrow we get construction spending. On Tuesday we get light vehicle sales for November, which tend to be a good indicator of how the job market performed for the month. Wednesday we get the ADP Jobs report (a preview to Friday's jobs report), as well as ISM Non-Manufacturing and New Home Sales. Thursday, as always, brings initial jobless claims. Also the 2nd revision of Q3 GDP comes out. And then Friday, of course, is the big Non-Farm Payrolls report for November. Per Calculated Risk, analyst expect 180,000 new jobs, and the unemployment rate to fall to 7.2%. For more details on all this data, check out Calculated Risk.
Daniel Cohen A Metro-North trail derailed Sunday morning in the Bronx.  At least four people were killed and 67 people injured, 11 of them critically, according to NBC News, citing authorities. The victims have been confirmed as three adult males and one adult female.  The accident happened around 7:20 a.m. ET as the train was rounding a curve around 100 feet from its next stop at Spuyten Duyvil station, when five of seven cars came off the tracks, an MTA spokesman said. MTA The cause of the accident is not known. The National Transportation Safety Board is expected to make a statement shortly.   According to CNN: "A law enforcement official on the scene and familiar with the investigation said the train operator told investigators he applied brakes to the train, but it didn't slow down." In a news conference, MTA Chairman Thomas F. Prendergast said that speed is one of the factors authorities plan to look at during the investigation.  Hudson Line Service has been suspended between Croton Harmon station and Grand Central, Metro-North said on its website. Amtrak service has also been disrupted between New York City and Albany.  There was an initial report from the AP that "some cars" had gone into the water. However images from news organizations, as well as social media show multiple derailments with cars near, but not in, the water. The train left Poughkeepsie at 5:54 a.m. and was scheduled to arrived at Grand Central at 7:43 a.m. The accident is not related to a freight train that derailed near the same station in July, NBC News reported.  Here are some pictures of the scene and screenshots from social media.

The true measure of a career is to be able to be content, even proud, that you succeeded through your own endeavors without leaving a trail of casualties in your wake. â€“ Alan Greenspan If economists could manage to get themselves thought of as humble, competent people on a level with dentists, that would be splendid. â€“ John Maynard Keynes And He spoke a parable to them: "Can the blind lead the blind? Will they not both fall into the ditch?" â€“ Luke 6:39-40 Six years ago I hosted my first Thanksgiving in a Dallas high-rise, and my then-90-year-old mother came to celebrate, along with about 25 other family members and friends. We were ensconced in the 21stÂ floor penthouse, carousing merrily, when the fire alarms went off and fire trucks began to descend on the building. There was indeed a fire, and we had to carry my poor mother down 21 flights of stairs through smoke and chaos as the firemen rushed to put out the fire. So much for the advanced fire-sprinkler system, which failed to work correctly. I wrote one of my better letters that week, called "The Financial Fire Trucks Are Gathering." You can read all about itÂ here, if you like. I led off by forming an analogy to my Thanksgiving Day experience: I rather think the stock market is acting like we did at dinner. When the alarms go off, we note that we have heard them several times over the past few months, and there has never been a real fire. Sure, we had a credit crisis in August, but the Fed came to the rescue. Yes, the subprime market is nonexistent. And the housing market is in free-fall. But the economy is weathering the various crises quite well. Wasn't GDP at an almost inexplicably high 4.9% last quarter, when we were in the middle of the credit crisis? And Abu Dhabi injects $7.5 billion in capital into Citigroup, setting the market's mind at ease. All is well. So party on like it's 1999. However, I think when we look out the window from the lofty market heights, we see a few fire trucks starting to gather, and those sirens are telling us that more are on the way. There is smoke coming from the building. Attention must be paid. I was wrong when I took the (decidedly contrarian) position that we were in for a mild recession. It turned out to be much worse than even I thought it would be, though I had the direction right. Sadly, it usually turns out that I have been overly optimistic. This year we again brought my now-96-year-old mother to my new, not-quite-finished high-rise apartment to share Thanksgiving with 60 people; only this time we had to contract with a private ambulance, as she is, sadly, bedridden, although mentally still with us. And I couldn't help pondering, do we now have an economy and a market that must be totally taken care of by an ever-watchful central bank, which can no longer move on its own? I am becoming increasingly exercised that the new direction of the US Federal Reserve, which is shaping up as "extended forward rate guidance" of a zero-interest-rate policy (ZIRP) through 2017, is going to have significant unintended consequences. My London partner, Niels Jensen, reminded me in his November client letter that, In his masterpieceÂ The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money,Â John Maynard Keynes referred to what he called the "euthanasia of the rentier". Keynes argued that interest rates should be lowered to the point where it secures full employment (through an increase in investments). At the same time he recognized that such a policy would probably destroy the livelihoods of those who lived off of their investment income, hence the expression. Published in 1936, little did he know that his book referred to the implications of a policy which, three quarters of a century later, would be on everybody's lips. Welcome to QE. It is this neo-Keynesian fetish that low interest rates can somehow spur consumer spending and increase employment and should thus be promoted even at the expense of savers and retirees that is at the heart of today's central banking policies. The counterproductive fact that savers and retirees have less to spend and therefore less propensity to consume seems to be lost in the equation. It is financial repression of the most serious variety, done in the name of the greater good; and it is hurting those who played by the rules, working and saving all their lives, only to see the goal posts moved as the game nears its end. Central banks around the world have engineered multiple bubbles over the last few decades, only to protest innocence and ask for further regulatory authority and more freedom to perform untested operations on our economic body without benefit of anesthesia. Their justifications are theoretical in nature, derived from limited-variable models that are supposed to somehow predict the behavior of a massively variable economy. The fact that their models have been stunningly wrong for decades seems to not diminish the vigor with which central bankers attempt to micromanage the economy. The destruction of future returns of pension funds is evident and will require massive restructuring by both beneficiaries and taxpayers. People who have made retirement plans based on past return assumptions will not be happy.Â Does anyone truly understand the implications of making the world's reserve currency a carry-trade currency for an extended period of time?Â I can see how this is good for bankers and the financial industry, and any intelligent investor will try to take advantage of it; but dear gods, the distortions in the economic landscape are mind-boggling. We can only hope there will be a net benefit, but we have no true way of knowing, and the track records of those in the driver's seats are decidedly discouraging. For this week's Thanksgiving weekend letter I offer a section from my new book (co-authored with Jonathan Tepper), calledÂ Code Red. You can see a video interview with Jonathan Tepper and me and buy the bookÂ here,Â or of course you can go toÂ AmazonÂ and read the reviews. And the book is in all the bookstores. Needless to say, it will make an excellent gift for clients, family, and friends. At the end of the letter I will provide a link to a free webinar I am doing next week with Jonathan Tepper and Lacy Hunt, hosted by Altegris Investments, on the implications of ZIRP and other unconventional policies; but now let's jump intoÂ Code Red.Â In this section, we deal with the topic of central banking and its failures and ponder the implications of continuing to give the same people ever more authority and responsibility. This is from Chapter 5, called: Arsonists Running the Fire Brigade In the old days, central banks raised or lowered interest rates if they wanted to tighten or loosen monetary policy. In a Code Red world everything is more difficult. Policies like ZIRP, QE, LSAPs, and currency wars are immensely more complicated. Knowing how much money to print and when to undo Code Red policies will require wisdom and foresight. Putting such policies into practice is easy, almost like squeezing toothpaste. But unwinding them will be like putting the toothpaste back in the tube. Promoting Failure We'll admit that we're having too much fun criticizing central bankers, the Colonel Jessups of the Code Red world. But please don't just take our word for it when we tell you that they're clueless. Let's look at what others have written. In 2009 Congress created the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission to uncover the causes and consequences of the financial catastrophe that almost brought down the world financial system. They roundly condemned the Federal Reserve: We conclude this crisis was avoidable. The crisis was the result of human action and inactionâ€¦. The prime example is the Federal Reserve's pivotal failure to stem the flow of toxic mortgages, which it could have done by setting prudent mortgage lending standards. The Federal Reserve was the one entity empowered to do so and it did notâ€¦. We conclude widespread failures in financial regulation and supervision proved devastating to the stability of the nation's financial markets. Not surprisingly, public confidence in the Fed has plummeted. The Federal Reserve performed disastrously before the Great Financial Crisis, but almost all central banks were asleep at the wheel. The record of central banks around the world leading up to the Great Financial Crisis was an unmitigated disaster. All countries that had housing bubbles and large bank failures failed to spot them beforehand. In the case of England, where almost all major banks went bust (some rather spectacularly!) and required either nationalization or fire sales to foreign banks, the Bank of England never saw the crisis coming. Let's look at whatÂ The EconomistÂ has to say about central bank failures: In 1996 the Bank of England pioneered financial-stability reports (FSRs); over the next decade around 50 central banks and the IMF followed suit. But according to research cited by Howard Davies and David Green in "Banking on the Future: The Fall and Rise of Central Banking," published last year, in 2006 virtually all the reports, including Britain's, assessed financial systems as healthy. In the basic function of identifying emerging threats, "many central banks have been performing poorly," they wrote. According to published reports, the Bank of England only learned about the bankruptcy of one huge bank after another a few days before the actual public announcement. So much for staying on top of the situation. The regulators were captured by the very institutions they were supposed to regulate, with neither the banks of the regulators understanding the serious nature of the problems they were creating with their actions. Housing bubbles swelled and burst everywhere: Spain, Ireland, Latvia, Cyprus, and the United Kingdom. Countries that had to recapitalize or nationalize their banks were broadsided by a disaster they did not anticipate, prepare for, or take action to prevent. In the case of Spain, even after the crisis unfolded, the Bank of Spain acted like a pimp for its own banks. It insisted nothing was wrong and proceeded to help its banks sell loads of crap to unsuspecting Spaniards in order to recapitalize the banks. (We apologize for our language, but there is no other word besidesÂ crapÂ that properly characterizes selling worthless securities to poor pensioners â€“ well, there are, but they are even less suitable for public consumption). In fairness, central bankers did save the world after the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy. The money printing that the Federal Reserve oversaw after the failure of Lehman Brothers was entirely appropriate to avoid another Great Depression. But giving them credit for that is like praising an arsonist for putting out the fire he started. Figure 5.3 Ben Bernanke: The hero who saved the world The Atlantic The failure of central banks makes it all the more remarkable that they were given even more responsibility in the wake of crisis. Since 2007 central banks have expanded their remits, either at their own initiative or at governments' behest. They have exceeded the limits of conventional monetary policy by buying massive amounts of long-dated government bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and other assets. They have also taken on more responsibility for the supervision of banks and the stability of financial systems. The Banking Act of 1933, more popularly known as the Glass-Steagall Act, forced a separation of commercial and investment banks by preventing commercial banks from underwriting securities. Investment banks were prohibited from taking deposits. Until it was repealed in 1999, the Glass-Steagall Act worked brilliantly, helping to prevent a major financial crisis. It was replaced by the Graham-Leach-Bliley Act, which ended regulations that prevented the merger of banks, stock brokerage companies, and insurance companies. The American public's interests were thrown to the wolves of Wall Street, and the Fed and the Clinton administration gave the middle finger to financial stability. After the Great Financial Crisis, Congress could have simply reinstated Glass-Steagall. The act was only 37 pages long, but it had worked incredibly well. Instead, after an orgy of bank lobbying and Congressional kowtowing to the bankers who had brought the world to the brink of a global depression, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Act. It is over 2,300 pages long; no one is sure what is in it or what it means; and it has added a dizzyingly complex tangle of regulations and bureaucracy to what should have been a simple, straightforward reform of the financial sector. (The act is so long and complicated that it was nicknamed the "Lawyers' and Consultants' Full Employment Act of 2010.") You will hardly be reassured to learn that the Federal Reserve's powers were expanded through Dodd-Frank. Please note that it was the same banks and investment firms that lobbied to repeal Glass-Steagall in 1999 that so aggressively and successfully lobbied for the Dodd-Frank Act. While there are some features contained in the plan that are good, the basic problems still remain. Industry insiders were able to assure that business as usual could continue. And to judge from their profits, it has done so remarkably well. Figure 5.4 Major financial legislation: number of pages John Mauldin The Fed didn't need more powers. In the years leading up to the Great Financial Crisis, the Fed already had almost all the tools it needed to prevent the subprime debacle. It simply failed to use them. You could call that lapse nonfeasance, dereliction of duty, going AWOL, or anything other than doing their duty. If you don't believe you are capable of recognizing a bubble in advance, then all the additional regulations in the world won't make any difference in preventing a bubble. Dodd-Frank merely gave them more regulations not to enforce. It is the mindset that needs changing, not simply the regulations. According to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, the Federal Reserve failed to use the tools at its disposal to regulate mortgages or bank holding companies or to prevent the abusive lending practices that contributed to the crisis. The central bank didn't "recognize the cataclysmic danger posed by the housing bubble to the financial system and refused to take timely action to constrain its growth," the report said. It also "failed to meet its statutory obligation to establish and maintain prudent mortgage lending standards and to protect against predatory lending." The most sordid part of the Great Financial Crisis was not the extreme failure by central banks to regulate. The most egregious violation of the public interest came in the form of the massive subsidies and aid the central banks gave to the banking system when the crisis was underway. The great journalist and essayist Walter Bagehot argued in the mid-19thÂ century that during a financial crisis central banks should lend freely but at interest rates high enough to deter borrowers not genuinely in need, and only against good collateral. During the crisis, the Fed and other central banks lent trillions of dollars at zero cost against the shoddiest of collateral. And the Fed went out of its way to provide gifts to Wall Street banks via the back door. For example, when AIG went bust, Timothy Geithner decided that the US taxpayer should pay out credit default swaps to AIG's counterparties at full price. Goldman Sachs was given a parting gift to $10 billion. Ge ithner did not even negotiate a haircut. The money went to dozens of banks, many which were not even American. It is no wonder Geithner became well-known as "Wall Street's lapdog." Our good friend Dylan Grice wrote a fascinating piece on what happens when you have too many rules and too little common sense. In a Dutch town called Drachten, local government decided to take out all traffic lights and signs. They hoped people would pay more attention to the road rather than fixate on rules and regulations. They were right. In Drachten there used to be a road death every three years, but there have been none since traffic light removal started in 1999. There have been a few small collisions, but these are almost to be encouraged. A traffic planner explained, "We want small accidents in order to prevent serious ones in which people get hurt." Let's see what Dylan has to say about the lessons for capital markets: You might be thinking that traffic lights don't have anything to do with the markets we all work in. But I think they do. Instead of traffic lights and road signs think rating agencies; think Basel risk weights for Core 1 and Core 2 bank capital; think Solvency 2; or think of the ultimate market regulators of our currencies â€“ the central banks â€“ and the Greenspan/Bernanke "put" which was once imagined to exist. Haven't these regulators provided the same illusion of safety to financial market participants as traffic safety tools do for drivers? And hasn't this illusion of safety been even more lethal? Wouldn't it be nice if central bankers thought more like Drachten town planners? But central bankers and parliaments prefer extensive rules to a common-sense approach. Unlike the planners of Drachten, the Federal Reserve and central banks around the world issue extensive sets of regulation, fail to enforce them, encourage everyone to speed, and then when crashes happen they protect as many banks as possible from the consequences of their own actions. The Federal Reserve is in desperate need of reform. This doesn't mean that politicians should be deciding interest rates or that banking supervision should be taken away from central banks. But central bankers should be answerable to the public for how they do their jobs. Accountability has been completely missing throughout the entire crisis. Almost all central banks failed to do even the basics of their job. The regulations they created, especially in Europe, made it possible for banks to take massive risk and make huge profits that ultimately had to be bailed out by taxpayers. They believe the banks and other institutions they were regulating when they showed the models which they created which demonstrated conclusively there was no risk. Everyone, bankers and regulators, believed we were in a new era, for the old rules of common sense didn't apply. Central bankersÂ  didn't need more rules or regulations. They failed miserably at even carrying out the simple job they had. The regulatory functions of central banks should be treated like those of any other regulatory agency. It is critical that we hold central bankers accountable for their management of the banking system. No Apologies, Only Promotions One of the most disastrous battles of World War I was the British Gallipoli campaign in Turkey in 1915. It was utterly devastating, leaving more than 50,000 British wounded and almost 100,000 dead. Winston Churchill, first lord of the Admiralty, was one of the architects of the campaign. In the wake of the outcome, he resigned his post to become a soldier in the war. Churchill was a humble man who felt he was at fault. He was honorable. But if Churchill had been a central banker, he would never have had to accept responsibility or resign. He would have kept his job and been given even more far-reaching powers and a big pay raise to boot. For the past few years, central bankers have been living large. The same people who brought us the Great Financial Crisis are now bringing us a world of Code Red policies and financial repression. The arsonists are running the fire brigade. Where is the central banker who has apologized for contributing to the crisis or for being asleep at the wheel? Given how disastrous their performance has been, it is extraordinary that the same cast of characters is still running the show. Central bankers are lucky that they still have jobs. As far as we are aware, no central banker was fired for incompetence or mismanagement. Many have retired and are now enjoying generous pensions and highly paid consulting careers advising investment funds as to what their former colleagues might do next. Central bankers have had plenty of time to discuss the financial crisis since 2008, but they have provided only scholarly disquisitions as to what went wrong in the banking crisis, without accepting any responsibility at all. At no time have any central bankers admitted that they might have ignored the warning signs of excessive debt, kept interest rates too low for too long, ignored bubbles in housing markets, failed to regulate banks correctly, or proved themselves even mildly incompetent. Not only were central bankers not fired, many were promoted instead and given pay raises. Timothy Geithner, who headed the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, not only failed to regulate a host of banks that needed massive government bailouts but was an active apologist for Wall Street banks. For his efforts he was promoted to Secretary of the Treasury under President Obama. In Europe, Spanish central bankers stand out as perhaps the most incompetent ever, having overseen dozens of banks that created the biggest housing bubble in European history and having failed to recognize problems not only before but after they happened. Bankers like Jose ViÃ±als, Jose Caruana, and others were given plum jobs at the IMF and the ECB after being asleep at the wheel in Spain. Granting extra powers to central banks without a change in the philosophy behind their management is like encouraging an irresponsible teenager. Imagine your teenage son borrowed the family car and crashed it, and instead of punishing him you bought him a new Ferrari to test drive. Conventional monetary policies are like a sturdy old family station wagon, but Code Red policies are like a modified Ferrari 288 GTO capable of hitting 275 miles per hour. Given how spectacularly central banks failed during the Great Financial Crisis, it blows the mind that they've been handed the keys to a faster set of wheels. One last thought. You might get from reading this that we are against rules and regulations. Far from it. We just like very simple, workable rules. Reinstate Glass-Steagall. Limit the ability of banks to create leverage, and require even more capital as they get larger. Banks that are systemically too big to fail are too big, period. Take away the incentive to grow beyond what is prudent for the deposit insurance scheme of a nation to maintain. Allowing bankers to take the profits and then hand taxpayers the losses in a crisis is not good policy, even if it is bolstered by 1,000 pages of regulations written by lawyers and bank lobbyists who then proceed to "massage" them in order to do what they want to anyway. But, alas, such hopes may remain dreams deferred until there is yet another crisis and taxpayers are asked to absorb even greater losses (but we can always hope!). So, in the meantime, as prudent investors and managers, we must be aware of the realities we face. The saying in Africa is that it is not the lion you can see that is the danger, instead it is the one hidden in the grass that leaps out at you as you try to escape the one you see. Later we will talk about a few strategies that can help you handle the risks that crouch hidden in the grass. Navigating the Unknown:Â  What Investors Need to Know for 2014 I'd like to remind all US accredited investors or FINRA-licensed advisors to register and join me for an exclusive upcoming Mauldin Circle webinar onÂ Tuesday, December 3, atÂ 1:00 p.m. EST/10:00 a.m. PST.Â This highly anticipated event,Â "Navigating the Unknown:Â  What Investors Need to Know for 2014,"Â aims to provide investors with key perspectives for making portfolio decisions in 2014.Â I've invited myÂ Code RedÂ co-author, Jonathan Tepper; renowned economist Lacy Hunt; and alternatives expert Jon Sundt, CEO &amp; President of Altegris, to join me.Â This panel represents a terrific mix of economic and investment viewpoints with a focus on investor solutions.

New York, Geneva, Saudi Arabia, Dubai, and Northwest Canada I will be in New York this week for meetings and a keynote speech at theÂ CIO Investment Summit, where I will also be on a panel with Jim Grant, whom I will actually get to meet for the first time. I've been a Jim Grant fan for decades, and it will be a delight to sit next to him and hear him speak live. My friend Mark Yusko has put together a powerhouse one-day conference that also includes Kyle Bass and John Paulson. The following week features a quick trip to Seattle for my partners at Altegris Investments. Then I'll zip back to Dallas to change suitcases and head to Geneva for a few days before returning home for Christmas. Then in early January I leave for the Middle East to speak atMASIC's CSR Policy Forum and to meet investors and leaders in the area. I also plan to visit Dubai for a few days â€“ I've been told it is a place I must see to believe. If you are in either town, drop me a note. It is time to hit the send button. I am almost moved into my new abode, although the office will be finished next week while I am in NYC, so I am writing this missive from my old one-bedroom office apartment. Waking up this morning in the new place to look out over downtown Dallas on a beautiful morning was a true pleasure. I feelÂ homeÂ for the first time in a long time and am surprised at how good it feels. Maybe it's just the newness, but I hope not. This very first day saw some 50-odd family and friends gather to christen the place, spilling food and drink; and there was the madness of a dozen young kids cavorting and another dozen people working happily on the massive spread. Hard to believe that the day before some 15 construction artisans ("workers" seems so pedestrian a title for the level of work they do) were busy hammering, sawing, painting, and applying stone and wood and wire to get the place almost ready to move into â€“ which we proceeded to do. And then we cooked and prepared for the big day. Have a great week. I am looking forward to December in NYC, always a magical experience.

APBill de Blasio starts January 1.NEW YORK (Reuters) - WithÂ Bill de BlasioÂ taking office as mayor in January, New York City appears poised for a resurgence of liberal policies. After 20 years of Republican leadership, not only willÂ America's largest city have the most liberal mayor in a generation, helping him implement change will be a progressive-leaningÂ City CouncilÂ and a longtime liberal ally in the new public advocate. The city was governed for the last 12 years by MichaelÂ Bloomberg, a political independent who was first elected as a Republican, and for eight years before that by RepublicanRudolph Giuliani. To observers as well as Democratic legislators, the last election marked a major change in New York City politics, with a new breed of highly liberal politicians ready to enact a series of progressive policies that would have been dead on arrival underÂ BloombergÂ or his predecessor Giuliani. "It's seen as an opportunity by progressives to do something different," said Douglas Muzzio, an expert on New York City politics and a professor atÂ Baruch CollegeÂ atÂ the City University of New York. "People projected their frustration, their anxiety, their expectations, their dreams on Bill. In that sense it wasn't dissimilar from the 2008 election of Obama. Now he's got to deliver." Pledging to address the gap between the rich and poor that grew wider as the city prospered while those at the bottom of the economic ladder struggled to pay for basic services such as housing and mass transit, de Blasio won a resounding victory in November with more than 70 percent of the vote. Over the last decade, apartment rents in New York City increased about 44 percent and the cost of a monthly subway card rose by 60 percent. De Blasio has vowed to set a new tone atÂ City Hall, and his agenda includes reforming police tactics, offering universal access to early childhood education, expanding the city's paid sick leave rules and improving the living standard for the 46 percent of New Yorkers at or below the poverty line. "I would definitely define this as a movement," said progressive DemocratÂ Laurie Cumboof Brooklyn, who was elected to theÂ City CouncilÂ in November. "This idea that somebody has to be on the bottom so somebody can be on the top, which is somewhat of a global business model, doesn't have to be that way." PLAYING IT DIFFERENTLY The shift in tone in city government is already apparent. Earlier this month, theÂ City CouncilÂ took the rare step of rejecting a rezoning of Manhattan's East Side, delivering a blow toÂ BloombergÂ and developers who had forcefully backed the plan. Then, the city's mass-transit agency announced it was cutting its planned fare increases for 2015 and 2017 by nearly half. The agency cited an improved fiscal outlook, butÂ Gene Russianoff, a lawyer and the spokesman for theÂ New York Public Interest Research Group's Straphangers Campaign, said he saw the move as reflecting a changed political climate. "They realized in the current political atmosphere it's unsustainable to raise the fare a lot every year," Russianoff said. "Bloomberg's attitude was, 'Everything goes up.' I think de Blasio will play it differently." One early test for left-leaning politicians will be the race for the nextÂ City CouncilÂ Speaker. Progressive members of the council, who saw their numbers double from 10 to 20 in November, have formed a Progressive Caucus and vowed to vote as a block for the next speaker. "The mayor-elect has been very clear about his top priorities and they all line up very well with the goals of progressives in the Council," said CouncilmanÂ Brad Lander, a co-chairman of the Progressive Caucus. On many issues, the liberals will find an ally in the city's next Public Advocate, former councilwomanÂ Letitia James. While James and de Blasio endorsed one another for the respective posts during the campaign, the new public advocate has pledged to keep rigorous checks and balances on the mayor. James, a champion of minority and women's rights, vocally opposed big development in her section of Brooklyn during her 10 years in theÂ City Council, including the Atlantic Yards development and the recently opened Barclays Center, home to the Brooklyn Nets professional basketball team. As liberals prepare their political wish lists, the city's Republicans, outnumbered six-to-one by Democrats, are wary. "We've had 20 years of success under Republican mayors," said ManhattanÂ Republican PartyÂ Chairman Dan Isaacs. "Improved safety, crime is down, business and real estate is thriving. But in some ways we were victims of our success. It's hard to impart to people that the gains we've made could be lost very quickly." Muzzio said the challenge now is maintaining the progress logged underÂ Bloombergwhile making the city more inclusive. "Bill isn't a bomb-thrower," he said. "There's going to be a lot of continuity withÂ Bloomberg. There has to be." (Editing by Edith Honan and Gunna Dickson)
The White House/Pete SouzWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two months after Obamacare's disastrous launch, senior administration officials on Sunday will seek to showcase the repairs to the government's troubled website meant to sign up millions of people who need subsidized health insurance. PresidentÂ Barack Obama's specially appointed adviser,Â Jeffrey Zients, is expected to describe the results of a five-week emergency effort aimed at making the federal HealthCare.gov website more accessible to users, more responsive and less prone to errors, according to officials. "We will be providing an update on the progress made to date, so that the website works smoothly for the vast majority of users, including updated data on capacity, response time and error rate," said an administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the effort. The administration's weekend deadline could mark a new chapter for Obama's signature domestic policy if HealthCare.gov has improved well enough to handle millions of potential applications for health coverage from the uninsured as well as others whose current insurance policies face cancellation at the end of the year. But a repeat of the Oct 1. launch, when the site crashed as millions of visitors flooded in, could leave hundreds of thousands of people without coverage and deal a staggering political blow to the president's legacy and the 2014 election prospects of congressional Democrats. Basic account creation and log-in functions appeared to work smoothly on Saturday, the deadline set by Zients, but groups helping the sign-up effort described other errors in the process. Health insurance companies warned much work remained to allow seamless enrollment. HealthCare.gov will face increasing pressure in the days and weeks to come, as consumers who want benefits in time for the new year have a December 23 deadline to sign up. Republican lawmakers, due back in Washington from a holiday weekend, are prepared to seize on any new technical woes as they campaign to derail the law. Zients is due to host a teleconference with reporters at 9 a.m. ET, just hours after government contractors are expected to complete the latest batch of fixes. The administration's goal is to handle 50,000 users simultaneously, or about 800,000 visitors a day. Administration officials say HealthCare.gov, which serves consumers in 36 states, will continue to be prone to outages and delays and predict that fixes will continue for months. As late as midday ET (1700 GMT) on Saturday, officials were still describing 50,000 simultaneous users as a goal they were making progress toward and said upgrades overnight on Friday, followed by hardware and software fixes early on Sunday, would put the administration on track to achieve intended capacity. ENOUGH TIME TO ENROLL? TheÂ Obama administrationÂ had hoped to enroll about 7 million people in 2014 under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Many of those consumers are expected to qualify for subsidies. To work, the program must get millions of young, healthy consumers to sign up by March 31. Their participation is key to keeping the program's costs in check. "There's still plenty of time to reach people who are now uninsured, and especially the young and healthy who are key to keeping the insurance market stable," saidÂ Larry Levitt, a senior vice president at theÂ Kaiser Family Foundation. But groups helping consumers navigate the site said some problems continued over the weekend that suggested deeper troubles. InÂ Pennsylvania,Â Ted TrevorrowÂ works for a nonprofit group called Resources for Human Development. He tried to help a man on Saturday who created two applications because of technical snafus - one by phone, and one online - and cannot access either of them. "He ran into some sort of technical glitch, and now it will require the intervention of a programmer," Trevorrow said. Another client hit an inexplicable wall in the subsidy eligibility process. "The system just stopped and wouldn't go any further," said Trevorrow. "It just plain doesn't work and it needs to be fixed." Republicans have argued that Obamacare is fatally flawed and should be scrapped, and have brandished stories of Americans who are unhappy with losing old health plans or seeing higher costs for new ones. "Americans are far less concerned about a website than they are about the availability and affordability of their health care," saidÂ Mitch McConnell, the top Republican in the U.S. Senate, in a statement. The administration said on Saturday that 90 percent of website users can now create an account on the system - a statistic that some information technology experts said sounded rosy but was impossible to verify. "It prevents anyone from the outside from contradicting them," said Jonathan Wu, co-founder of the consumer financial website ValuePenguin.
