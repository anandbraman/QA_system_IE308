It's hard to imagine that a snowstorm could have been more hysterically and loudly forecasted than Nemo, but that didn't stop lots of folks in the northeast from setting out in their cars last night. So, today, the National Guard had to rescue some of them. (CNN's Jake Tapper tweeted this photo from the Connecticut National Guard this morning.) Who says we don't need a government? (Okay, assuming there is actually someone in this car, maybe they absolutely had to be driving. But, if so, you're paying for their rescue!) Connecticut National Guard, Jake Tapper
16x9onglobalYoko Ono, Susan Sarandon and other celebrities recently toured a fracking site in Pennsylvania. They have been at the vanguard of an effort to keep fracking out of New York ‚Äî ¬†the practice has been banned since 2010. But the urgency of the issue in New York is belied by a larger the truth about the environmental dangers of fracking: we pretty much know what they are, and know how to deal with them. Quick recap: fracking involves pumping hundreds of thousands of gallons of water and chemicals into rocks to fracture them and release their oil and gas. Though the practice is not new, there's been an explosion of horizontal drilling all over the country as the full extent of shale resources trapped in places like south Texas and western Pennsylvania began to be known. ¬† But it remains controversial over fears about its environmental impact. Last month, the New York Times' Danny Hakim got hold of an official New York health department document suggesting fracking could be performed safely. It first enumerates all the potential dangers fracking could pose ‚Äî evidence for each of which has been previously documented: Hakim notes that the health department discusses how each of these issues can be tackled: The Department proposes numerous controls, including but not limited to liners and secondary containment for storage of chemicals on the well pad, and increased standards for well construction, cementing and blowout prevention equipment. Still, the report was dismissed by many ‚Äî including the Health Department itself, who said the document was "out of date" and that a new version was being drawn up that would contain "substantial changes." New Yorkers Against Fracking¬†said¬†the document "cavalierly [dismisses] the health impacts" of the practice. Even Hakim took issue, questioning "how much original research the state has done on potential health impacts" of fracking.¬† But there is also a lengthy 2011 study from New York's Department of Environmental Conservation¬†‚Äî¬†referenced in the document he reported ‚Äî that¬†includes a 154-page chapter called "Mitigation Measures." Among those recommendations: The list goes on ‚Äî though as it turns out, not even 154 pages of "Mitigation Measures" gives the full picture. ¬†The 2011 report makes numerous references to a 1992 study on the environmental impact of oil drilling (that dealt with regular, vertical drilling) should also be referenced. ¬† That study¬†adds at least 33 more pages of mitigation recommendations.¬† It seems fracking can be performed safely. The practice has been around for decades, and outgoing Interior Secretary Ken Salazar has said as much on at least one occasion. ¬† Number of pages is never a guarantee of anything, of course ‚Äî everything hinges on regulators' execution. And oil companies' continued insistence on¬†denying outright the hazards linked to above,¬†putting stumbling blocks in the way of further regulation¬†and resisting transparency on disclosing chemicals¬†has bred further mistrust. If they've merely been trying to save a few bucks, it's safe to say this strategy has backfired, given the resistance with which fracking has been met not just on the Eastern Seaboard but all over Europe.¬† If oil companies want to tone down debate, they'll need to be more transparent to build trust. But the knee-jerk terror fracking has prompted in some communities seems unwarranted.¬† Fracking is not new. It's been going on for decades in Texas and the Mountain West. The only difference is now is that it's being proposed in places where it hasn't been done before. Given the benefits that we know come with the practice, it seems communities should be demanding safe fracking, rather than turning it away.¬†

This year marks the year of the snake. Analysts will be watching the spending patterns of consumers to gauge the economic recovery in China. Everyone else will be watching the celebrations.
Wikimedia CommonsThese last few days notwithstanding, markets have really been on an incredible tear. So what are real investors thinking? Nomura's interest rate strategist George Goncalves has a great weekend note out in which he relays some observations from professional money managers, after he and his colleagues did a big global tour to kick off 2013. Uniformly, he found that the view was this: The Fed had its hand on the till, and there was almost no way for risk assets to go down in light of the Fed stimulus. Virtually everyone was bullish. Even the bond managers aren't worried about a great-rotation inspired selloff (they're not really that worried about a shift from bonds to equities) though it is in the back of their minds. From his note: Great Rotation or a Great Consternation?Many of the bond fund manager (ex-hedge funds) that we spoke with were not convinced that a ‚ÄïGreat Rotation‚Äñ was in the making and agreed with our view that there is enough cash on the sidelines to lift all asset classes on the margin so long as the Fed keeps QE alive. One account said, ‚ÄïIf the Fed is benefiting stocks, why would that be at the expense of bonds when they are using bonds to ease.‚Äñ He went on to say, ‚ÄïIf the slightly less dovish FOMC minutes released in early January were enough to spook bond investors, if the Fed ever hinted that easing is going to stop, watch out below stocks.‚Äñ The more I listened to their concerns and questions from a wide cross section of investors, the more I felt there is a great consternation about what keeps inflows coming into all types of investments funds. At the end of the day it‚Äòs all about AUM and the pie is only theoretically bigger because the Fed is retiring bonds, even if they don‚Äòt stop perhaps there has been much ado about this great rotation and instead cash will be carefully deployed given how many markets are stretched in valuations (Stocks, TIPS, FX, etc.). Looming Risks, Forget About It! I travelled with Nomura‚Äòs Jens Nordvig, Head of Americas FI Research and Global FX, Rob Subbaraman, Head of AeJ Research and Asia Economist, Lewis Alexander, Chief US Economist and Naka Matsuzawa, Chief Investment JGB Strategist ‚Äì so net there was plenty of risk warning expressed by my peers on this trip. The reaction? Forget about it. As mentioned above, most investors are enamoured by easing in 2013 (pointing to the strong 5% up month on S&amp;P as just a start, not the end, of the risk rally). In all fairness, that is not all completely true; we did find 2-3 major accounts that were worried about some of the near-term and medium-term risks that we outlined during the trip (see below), but most thought we were too cute or that markets will see through all risks due to QE. So yeah, there may be some reasons to worry here and there (Italy, the sequester, etc.). But basically, everyone's pretty chill.
 It sounds like the GOP is going to bring back up the idea of attaching a Balanced Budget Amendment to the constitution. In a series of tweets this morning, the National Review's star DC reporter Robert Costa basically explained that the idea is to toss a bone to the far right (by proposing a BBA) and perhaps bring Obama to the center on spending. Nobody actually thinks there's any chance of said amendment getting through Congress anytime soon. This new move towards a BBA was anticipated a bit by George Will, who pushed for one in a column earlier this week, basically arguing that politicians are irresponsible, and only a constitutional amendment could force them to behave. He starts by knocking over what he see as the "various" counter arguments. Says Will:  The arguments against a constitutional amendment to require balanced budgets are various and, cumulatively, almost conclusive. Almost. The main arguments are: The Constitution should be amended rarely and reluctantly. Constitutionalizing fiscal policy is a dubious undertaking. Unless carefully crafted, such an amendment might instead be a constant driver of tax increases. A carefully crafted amendment that minimizes this risk could not pass until Republicans have two-thirds majorities in both houses of Congress, which they have not had since 1871. Furthermore, requiring a balanced budget would incite creative bookkeeping that would make a mockery of the amendment and the Constitution. For example, New York, which like 48 other states (all but Vermont) has some sort of requirement for a balanced budget, once balanced its by selling Attica Prison to itself: A state agency established to fund urban redevelopment borrowed $200 million in the bond market, gave the money to the state and took title to the prison. The state recorded as income the $200‚Äâmillion, declared the budget balanced, then rented the prison from the agency for a sum adequate to service the $200 million debt. All of those points are fine, as it goes, but they're far from the complete range of arguments against the idea. The biggest problem with a Balanced Budget Amendment is that it would destroy the economy. Yes, destroy. The size of the deficit is mostly a function, at any given time, not of spending or taxation policies, but of economic growth. This can easily be demonstrated by looking at a chart comparing deficits as a % of GDP vs. unemployment.  For over 60 years, throughout various policy regimes, the deficit has moved in tandem with employment. Taxation and government policy have never had much to do with how big the deficit is. To close the deficit by law (rather than by growth) would require extreme austerity. And furthermore, that austerity would be increasingly required as the economy gets worse. So things start going downhill, the government tries to cut spending to counteract the declining tax revenues, the economy gets weaker, and soon you're on a spiral to deflationary, depressionary hell. Cutting spending to reduce deficits doesn't work in practice. Japan has seen this play out, as its government has flirted with various austerity attempts during its log slog. Each time there's been an attempt to reduce deficits... deficits have gone up. The top Nomura economist Richard Koo has made this point (and this chart) a centerpiece of his economic work. Richard Koo So it's a terrible idea. But that's not really what's interesting here. What's interesting is the fact that the most basic reason to oppose this idea -- that it would demolish the economy -- isn't even well understood by the BBA's proponents, who only see minor technical reasons (there'd be loopholes!) to oppose. It'd be fine if George Will and everyone else wanted to say that the above analysis is wrong, and that the economy would be just fine if it had to balance the budget every year. That'd be a fine to debate to have. But at least be aware that this is the main issue. This problem isn't confined to just Will. The same ignorance was seen when Joe Scarborough wrote about how Paul Krugman was all alone in thinking that the deficit was not an urgent issue, which was just untrue. Lots of people agree with Paul Krugman on the question. Clearly in DC, the deficit debate is so one-sided, that many people aren't even aware there are counter-arguments or people who could be opposed, for economic reasons, the wisdom of shrinking the deficit.
Monthly data released last week were sparse, but included a substantial increase in December factory orders, Productivity in the 4th quarter decreased, and unit labor costs increased. Consumer credit increased, and wholesale inventories decreased.  This week continued to give some indications that tax increases may be affecting the economy. So Let's start this look at the high frequency weekly indicators by checking what is happening with tax withholding: Employment metrics Daily Treasury Statement tax withholding Initial jobless claims † American Staffing Association Index Employment metrics were again weak this week. Initial claims remained in their 2012 range this week. In the second half of 2012 the ASA index's performance compared with 2011 declined significantly, although the absolute index was higher. In the last two weeks, however, the Index declined below its 2007 values and has lessened its increase over last year at this time.  I am adjusting my YoY tax withholding figures to reflect the increase in personal withholding taxes. While the YoY collections are up substantially, they should be up over 15% to compesnate for the tax increase. Since I can think of no reason why employment itself should have fallen off a cliff in January, it is very possible that there is a lag in the payment of withholding taxes with the new increase. In fact, the rolling 20 day average this week is much better than the average was last week compared YoY. If this hypothesis is correct, I would expect tax withholding to be much more reliable by the end of February. Consumer spending † † Gallup remains significantly positive. The ICSC varied between +1.5% and +4.5% YoY in 2012. This week was again close to the bottom end of that range. Johnson Redbook is also in the lower part of its YoY growth range from 2012. Even in the worst case, it still looks like consumer spending has not collapsed due to the tax withholding increase. Housing metrics Housing prices Housing prices bottomed at the end of November 2011 on Housing Tracker, and have averaged an increase of +2.0% to +2.5% YoY for the last year.  Real estate loans, from the FRB H8 report:  † † Loans turned up at the end of 2011 and averaged about 1% gains YoY through most of 2012, and have recently shown somewhat more YoY strength. This week remained was closer to the bottom of its recent YoY range. Mortgage applications † † Purchase applications had been going sideways for 2 years,, but in recent weeks have finally looked like they may be breaking out of that range to the upside, but the move is not decisive yet. Refinancing applications were very high for most of last year with record low mortgage rates, which have recently increased. Interest rates and credit spreads † † Interest rates for corporate bonds have generally been falling since being just above 6% two years ago in January 2011, hitting a low of 4.46% in November 2012. Treasuries have fallen from about 2% in late 2011 to a low of 1.47% in July 2012. Spreads have varied between a high over 3.4% in June 2011 to a low under 2.75% in October 2012. The last several weeks have seen a marked increase in rates, although the YoY changes remain positive. Money supply M1 † † M2 † † Real M1 made a YoY high of about 20% in January 2012 and has generally been easing off since. This week's YoY reading remained above a new low set several weeks ago. Real M2 also made a YoY high of about 10.5% in January 2012. Its subsequent low was 4.5% in August 2012. It weakened once again this week. Both are still quite positive in absolute terms. Oil prices and usage † † Gas prices are increasing seasonally, although markedly so in the last week. Unusually for the last year plus, the 4 week average for the third week in a row was positive YoY. Transport Railroad transport † † † † Shipping transport † Rail transport has been whipsawing between very positive and very negative readings over the last 2 months. This may well be the aftermath of the dock strikes. Traffic ex-coal returned to being positive this week. The Harpex index is still near its 3 year low of 352, and the Baltic Dry Index is still generally declining towards its 52 week low from last February. Bank lending rates † The TED spread is barely above its 52 week low. LIBOR is again at a new 52 week low and is close to a 3 year low. JoC ECRI Commodity prices † The most important issue at the moment is whether the 2% increase in withholding tax rates is having an effect on consumers. We can add to that the issues of the impending austerity of the budget sequestration, and the potential consequences of moving income and spending forward into 2012 from 2013 due to tax increases. This week and last week it looks like we got evidence for the first time that there has been an effect.  By far the most negative data was tax withholdings, although these were not so bad as last week. Temporary jobs also stalled, and initial claims are back in their 2012 range. Bond interest rates and spreads are also increasing. Money supply, while positive, is near the lower end of its range.  Continuing positives include the housing market, money supply, consumer spedning, bank lending rates, and commodity prices. Gas prices, while rising, haven't turned constrictive yet. Gas usage has turned positive. Rail traffic is also positive again.  If austerity measures emanating from Washington are enough to tip the economy into contraction, the evidence should accumulate in the next few weeks. While there is some evidence of a consumer and employment slowdown, most of the high frequency data continues to support economic expansion.  Have a nice weekend.
Burberry via YouTubeChina's TV watchdog, State Administration of Radio, Film and Television (SARFT) has ordered all radio and television channels to cut advertisements that promote corrupt "gift giving". From Xinhua: "Ads on some channels have encouraged people to give gifts like luxury watches, rare stamps and gold coins, which has publicized incorrect values and helped create a bad social ethos, according to a circular issued by the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television (SARFT)." While it isn't clear which commercials could be targeted, some luxury brands have seen their stocks decline on the news. In light of that, we curated a few luxury commercials via Jing Daily and local sites like Youku that air China. Note: It isn't clear if these commercials will be banned. China hasn't released a list of commercials that is targeting.
19 Months in the Downtrend It has been a rough 19 months in the Coffee Market if you were long, and you had to be real nimble trying to trade the falling knife with some counter-trend trades. Coffee is currently trading around 1.41 per pound, and has been on a prolonged downtrend since peaking in May of 2011 at $3.12 a pound.¬†  The Coffee market is not as mainstream as many of the other more commonly traded markets. Accordingly, it is quite volatile, and many traders love its trending price action characteristics. The margins are higher to account for this increased volatility, and stops are an essential tool necessary for managing the position and protecting your trading capital.¬† Some basic facts about the market, Brazil is the world‚Äôs largest coffee producer and exporter, while the U.S. is the world‚Äôs largest consumer and importer.¬† www.econmatters.com No Inflation Here We are finally getting back to the 10 year trading range, for all those inflation hawks, it depends upon when you look at coffee, right now these prices sort of throw a bunch of cold water on the inflation thesis.¬† The chart looks absolutely bearish, and exemplifies the age old economic axiom that there is no cure for high prices like high prices.¬† www.econmatters.com Kick a Commodity when it`s down I think knowing a little bit about trader`s psychology that they will try and push this lower to squeeze any die hard longs, and trend trading being rampant in commodities, really push this to find the absolute bottom, i.e., natural gas at $1.90 last year, they tried it twice to ensure that was indeed the bottom.¬† www.econmatters.com Remember Natural Gas at $1.90? But just like Natural Gas once the bottom is established this trade could be quite fruitful going the other direction, and the coffee market is worth watching for when the market finally turns and heads higher.¬† Key Support Areas We are at some initial support at $1.40, but I want to watch it and see how this trades around that area as we still haven`t had any pullback in markets at large. I think there is a possibility that coffee ultimately tests the $1.20 a pound area where I am sure buyers will want to step in and test the waters here from the long side, as the $1 a pound level was established during the aftermath of the financial crisis selloff in December of 2008.¬† www.econmatters.com Positive Risk/Reward Setups The risk reward parameters are starting to come together for a nice trade setup from the long side, now we must patiently wait for the correct entry point. Therefore, the coffee market has entered the phase where it bears close scrutiny; it first has to get to this stage, now we put it on probation, and study for signs of the bottom, and a high percentage reversal play.¬† We want to watch how it handles the key support levels, how it trades in this area, this is where watching price action of the instrument and putting in the chart dues every day pays dividends. A good trader develops a feel for the commodity in order to navigate through the cluster of noise that pervades almost every trading instrument these days! ¬† Pull up a Coffee Chart So pull up a Coffee futures chart and watch along with me, you never know when the next Natural Gas style reversal will come, but you have to start being prepared for the possibility ahead of time, as these can be some of the most profitable, and easy to manage trading setups in the markets.¬† Commodities love the Trend Trade Once you are profitable on a reversal, just keep moving your stop up conservatively, and catch a nice trending run if market conditions cooperate. If not, hopefully you picked a decent entry point, and you got stopped out for a small profit, and wait for the next long signal.¬† The Coffee Market rarely disappoints¬† There may be a couple of false breakouts, but from my experience in markets, it is only a matter of time before the Coffee market reverses this bearish course, and makes another bullish run. It is just that kind of market, great for traders and well worth putting on your trading radar screens.¬© EconMatters All Rights Reserved | Facebook | Twitter | Post Alert | Kindle     Read more posts on EconMatters ¬ª
Everyone's talking about it: The Italian election polls. In two separate notes we're reading this weekend, analysts are putting the spotlight on the closing gap between Silvio Berlusconi's conservative party and the mainstream left party headed by Pier Bersani. First from State Street, a very clear chart showing hos Berlusconi's party is closing. This makes Europe very nervous. State Street Now here's the same chart from BofA/ML, which reveals another bit of information. The light blue line is the 5-star Party headed by populist comedian Beppe Grillo. If he gains and the Monti coalition slides, that makes a left coalition harder to form post-election. BofA/ML Keep watching this space. Reminder: We'll be LIVE on the ground in Italy. Please send us tips/advice on people we should meet and what to do.
Once one of the ‚Äúfour horsemen of tech‚Äù, the computer company rose to prominence by selling standardized boxes to enterprise customers.¬†The model was operational discipline and minimal R&amp;D. In the 80s and 90s it worked like a charm.¬† And then the 00s came, and the world was turned on its end. Now, with a $24.4 billion buyout offer on the table, led by CEO and founder Michael Dell in partnership with Silver Lake and Microsoft, this one-time stock market darling is slinking out of view of the public markets, in the hopes of making the changes that have eluded the company to date. The nexus of innovation shifted from the enterprise to consumers, and the dominant computing platforms shifted from the desktop to smartphones and tablets.¬† A proliferation of cloud-based offerings have reduced the amount of hardware most companies require, as enterprise customers began to grasp that they wanted computing power and storage, not servers, and if they could buy the former without buying the latter, they would do so.¬† In short, Dell is a casualty of the changes wrought by the successes of Apple (AAPL, $475) and Amazon (AMZN, $262) and the failures of Microsoft (MSFT, $28).¬† The one thing Dell has to be thankful for is that with its coherent story and more manageable size, it has a wider range of options to deliver shareholder value than does struggling tech giant Hewlett-Packard (HPQ, $17).¬†¬† Dell was always somewhat miscast as a tech darling.¬† An operationally focused company generally does not garner the type of hype that Dell once enjoyed, but the explosive growth of PC sales demanded shareholder attention.¬† That growth obscured the fact that Dell was and remains a fast follower, perhaps with more of an emphasis on the ‚Äúfollower‚Äù than the ‚Äúfast‚Äù.¬† When asked in 1997 what he would do if he were in charge of a then faltering Apple, Michael Dell said: ‚ÄúWhat would I do? I'd shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders‚Äù. I bring up this quote (which has been cited a great deal lately), only to illustrate the dramatic change in the tech world since those comments in 1997.¬† Need for a Change Conclusion Shareholders of Dell are in many ways suffering from the fact that their company was just small enough for a buyout to be feasible, and had struggled long enough for a bargain basement price to still represent a premium to the share price prior to the announcement.¬† But the success of this investment is not assured.¬† Dell‚Äôs profitability is weak and its revenue growth is negative, though the company does continue to generate strong cash flow and maintains a sizeable cash balance.¬† Turnarounds are messy, and tech turnarounds doubly so.¬† Dell is a company that needs to make considerable changes in its structure in order to return to an acceptable level of profitability.¬† The type of wholesale restructuring that is needed is best done out of the glare of the public markets.¬† The hope for this company is that the buyout will permit Dell to execute a comprehensive restructuring out of the glare of the public markets About the Author David Johnson (@TurnaroundDavid) is a partner with ACM Partners, a boutique financial advisory firm providing due diligence, performance improvement, restructuring and turnaround services.¬† He can be reached at 312-505-7238 or at david@acm-partners.com.
Robert Johnson ‚Äî Business InsiderHere in New York we've gotten spoiled by a mild winter without any snow.¬† But we're learning to brace for powerful storms. Swinging into town Friday night, the blizzard known as Nemo was taken seriously enough that my local movie theater on the Upper West side shut down early. Up and down the coast hundreds of thousands lost power, 5,000 flights were cancelled, and the storm pushed all the way into Canada. The Telegraph reports Saturday's 70 mph winds will do nothing to help cleanup efforts and offers more storm details here. Meanwhile in the middle of Manhattan we were met with a respectable covering of snow and headed out as the sun rose to see what was what.
Everyone's focused on the impact of the end of the payroll tax holiday (and the sequester) on consumer spending. But there's another headwind that's classically a problem: Gas prices. They're jumping again. Here's the chart of gasoline futures (via Sober Look) showing them surging. SoberLook In fact, gasoline prices are at their highest levels for this time of year. So that's the bad news. The good news is that consumers get increasingly inured to higher gas prices and end up compensating to the sticker shock. Still, if this keeps up, expect it to be a big issue again fairly soon.

BoeingBoeing faced with vast bill as 787 arrivals are delayed. Boeing's Dreamliner nightmare deepened yesterday when the planemaker warned airlines, including one of its biggest European customers and Britain's Thomson Airways, it looks likely to miss deliveries of its flagship new jet. The admission will pile tens of millions of dollars on to compensation claims as airlines set up replacement leasing deals and demand payouts for cancelled flights. Boeing said: "We have informed our customers expecting 787 deliveries in the near term that those aircraft either have been or are at risk of being delayed. We are staying in close communication with our customers as we work towards... a plan for resumption of 787 deliveries." The entire worldwide fleet of 787s has now been grounded for more than three weeks as investigators try to discover what is wrong with the plane's lithium-ion battery, which caught fire in Boston and forced an emergency landing in Japan. A further blow for the business came as Deborah Hersman, chairman of the United States National Transportation Safety Board, said the conditions used to assess the safety of the Dreamliner's batteries should be reconsidered, potentially leaving the 787s grounded for much longer. Switching to a different type of battery would be a major engineering operation as well as adding weight to the plane. Fuel efficiency thanks to the light lithium batteries was one of the 787's main selling points. Airbus is also understood to be considering whether drop lithium-ion batteries in its new A350s as the investigations into Dreamliner's problems continue. Thomson, which is due to take delivery of the first of eight Dreamliners this month, said it was "finalising contingency plans". Norwegian Air, which has eight Dreamliners on order, the first due in April and the second in June, said it "will enter into an agreement with a leasing company to operate long-haul routes in the event of the Dreamliner being delayed". Analysts said leasing just two planes the size of the 787 for three months would cost about $6m (¬£3.8m), a bill Boeing would have to foot. British Airways is still expecting its first 787 in May. It said it "remained committed to taking the delivery of four 787s in 2013". But analysts warned Boeing's battery problems would delay delivery schedules by around three months. Zafar Khan, aerospace analyst at Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale, said. "The real issue with the batteries has yet to be identified, but if they need to be redesigned or face recertification, it's looking like a delay of about three months. Clearly, Boeing will need to compensate customers." This is in addition to reimbursing airlines which have had to ground jets. Japan Airlines, which has eight, is looking at a cost of $8m from its earnings to the end of March and rival ANA, with 17, said it lost ¬•1.4bn (¬£9.6m) in January alone. Ms Hersman said: "The assumptions used to certify the battery must be reconsidered." 
Vincent Yu, AP HONG KONG (AP) ‚Äî For many of the richest people in Hong Kong, one of Asia's wealthiest cities, home is a mansion with an expansive view from the heights of Victoria Peak. For some of the poorest, like Leung Cho-yin, home is a metal cage. The 67-year-old former butcher pays 1,300 Hong Kong dollars ($167) a month for one of about a dozen wire mesh cages resembling rabbit hutches crammed into a dilapidated apartment in a gritty, working-class West Kowloon neighborhood. The cages, stacked on top of each other, measure 1.5 square meters (16 square feet). To keep bedbugs away, Leung and his roommates put thin pads, bamboo mats, even old linoleum on their cages' wooden planks instead of mattresses. "I've been bitten so much I'm used to it," said Leung, rolling up the sleeve of his oversized blue fleece jacket to reveal a red mark on his hand. "There's nothing you can do about it. I've got to live here. I've got to survive," he said as he let out a phlegmy cough. Some 100,000 people in the former British colony live in what's known as inadequate housing, according to the Society for Community Organization, a social welfare group. The category also includes apartments subdivided into tiny cubicles or filled with coffin-sized wood and metal sleeping compartments as well as rooftop shacks. They're a grim counterpoint to the southern Chinese city's renowned material affluence. Forced by skyrocketing housing prices to live in cramped, dirty and unsafe conditions, their plight also highlights one of the biggest headaches facing Hong Kong's unpopular Beijing-backed leader: growing public rage over the city's housing crisis. Leung Chun-ying took office as Hong Kong's chief executive in July pledging to provide more affordable housing in a bid to cool the anger. Home prices rose 23 percent in the first 10 months of 2012 and have doubled since bottoming out in 2008 during the global financial crisis, the International Monetary Fund said in a report last month. Rents have followed a similar trajectory. The soaring costs are putting decent homes out of reach of a large portion of the population while stoking resentment of the government, which controls all land for development, and a coterie of wealthy property developers. Housing costs have been fuelled by easy credit thanks to ultralow interest rates that policymakers can't raise because the currency is pegged to the dollar. Money flooding in from mainland Chinese and foreign investors looking for higher returns has exacerbated the rise. In his inaugural policy speech in January, the chief executive said the inability of the middle class to buy homes threatens social stability and promised to prioritize tackling the housing shortage. "Many families have to move into smaller or older flats, or even factory buildings," he said. "Cramped living space in cage homes, cubicle apartments and sub-divided flats has become the reluctant choice for tens of thousands of Hong Kong people," he said, as he unveiled plans to boost supply of public housing in the medium term from its current level of 15,000 apartments a year. His comments mark a distinct shift from predecessor Donald Tsang, who ignored the problem. Legislators and activists, however, slammed Leung for a lack of measures to boost the supply in the short term. Some 210,000 people are on the waiting list for public housing, about double from 2006. About a third of Hong Kong's 7.1 million population lives in public rental flats. When apartments bought with government subsidies are included, the figure rises to nearly half. Anger over housing prices is a common theme in increasingly frequent anti-government protests. Legislator Frederick Fung warns there will be more if the problem can't be solved. He compared the effect on the poor to a lab experiment. "When we were in secondary school, we had some sort of experiment where we put many rats in a small box. They would bite each other," said Fung. "When living spaces are so congested, they would make people feel uneasy, desperate," and angry at the government, he said. Leung, the cage dweller, had little faith that the government could do anything to change the situation of people like him. "It's not whether I believe him or not, but they always talk this way. What hope is there?" said Leung, who has been living in cage homes since he stopped working at a market stall after losing part of a finger 20 years ago. With just a Grade 7 education, he was only able to find intermittent casual work. He hasn't applied for public housing because he doesn't want to leave his roommates to live alone and expects to spend the rest of his life living in a cage. His only income is HK$4,000 ($515) in government assistance each month. After paying his rent, he's left with $2,700 ($350), or about HK$90 ($11.60) a day. "It's impossible for me to save," said Leung, who never married and has no children to lean on for support. Leung and his roommates, all of them single, elderly men, wash their clothes in a bucket. The bathroom facilities consist of two toilet stalls, one of them adjoining a squat toilet that doubles as a shower stall. There is no kitchen, just a small room with a sink. The hallway walls have turned brown with dirt accumulated over the years. While cage homes, which sprang up in the 1950s to cater mostly to single men coming in from mainland China, are becoming rarer, other types of substandard housing such as cubicle apartments are growing as more families are pushed into poverty. Nearly 1.19 million people were living in poverty in the first half of last year, up from 1.15 million in 2011, according to the Hong Kong Council Of Social Services. There's no official poverty line but it's generally defined as half of the city's median income of HK$12,000 ($1,550) a month. Many poor residents have applied for public housing but face years of waiting. Nearly three-quarters of 500 low-income families questioned by Oxfam Hong Kong in a recent survey had been on the list for more than 4 years without being offered a flat. Lee Tat-fong, is one of those waiting. The 63-year-old is hoping she and her two grandchildren can get out of the cubicle apartment they share in their Wan Chai neighborhood, but she has no idea how long it will take. Lee, who suffers from diabetes and back problems, takes care of Amy, 9, and Steven, 13, because their father has disappeared and their mother ‚Äî her daughter ‚Äî can't get a permit to come to Hong Kong from mainland China. An uncle occasionally helps. The three live in a 50-square-foot room, one of seven created by subdividing an existing apartment. A bunk bed takes up half the space, a cabinet most of the rest, leaving barely enough room to stand up in. The room is jammed with their possessions: plastic bags filled with clothes, an electric fan, Amy's stuffed animals, cooking utensils. "There's too little space here. We can barely breathe," said Lee, who shares the bottom bunk with her grandson. They share the communal kitchen and two toilets with the other residents. Welfare pays their HK$3,500 monthly rent and the three get another HK$6,000 for living expenses but the money is never enough, especially with two growing children to feed. Lee said the two often wanted to have McDonalds because they were still hungry after dinner, which on a recent night was meager portions of rice, vegetables and meat. The struggle to raise her two grandkids in such conditions was wearing her out. "It's exhausting," she said. "Sometimes I get so pent up with anger, and I cry but no one sees because I hide away."

Flip Schulke / EPA (via archives.gov)A Florida retirement community in the 1970s.Time was when retirement meant a move to a community where all your neighbors belonged to the same generation: Old. No more. As baby boomers begin to retire, they're going their own way -- or ways -- when it comes to housing choices and relocation strategies. "As they age, boomers are going to be doing a lot of different things," says John McIlwain, who just completed a housing report on the generation for the Urban Land Institute. "There's not going to be just one trend." That may be especially true in South Florida, where so many residents hail from elsewhere. South Florida boomers "form a lot of different slices," says Michael Greene, a Coldwell Banker broker-associate who has worked in the local market for more than 40 years. "Their choices really depend on their particular situation." McIlwain's report, "Housing in America -- The Baby Boomers Turn 65," details how this 78 million-strong generation is creating both challenges and opportunities for the real estate industry. About 10,000 boomers reach Medicare age every day, and the over-65 crowd is predicted to grow 36 percent by the end of this decade, to 54.8 million --up from 40 million in 2010. By 2030, the total will top 72 million. Because there are so many of them, boomers will affect the housing market for a long time. But how is anybody's guess. Some will stay in the homes where they raised their children. Others will downsize. Others may move to be closer to family or reduce housing costs down. And the affluent may buy a second home near the kids while keeping the old homestead. Whatever they do, "two things are important to them," says Ron Shuffield, president of EWM Realtors. "I call them the two C's -- community and convenience." Both come at a price, however, that some may be unable to afford after a housing bust and deep recession decimated their net worth. At a time when they should be retiring their mortgages, some boomers find themselves owing more than their homes are worth and unable to sell. "The repercussions of the Great Recession are definitely being felt by the baby boomers," says Jack McCabe, CEO of McCabe Research and Consulting in Deerfield Beach. "Some of them took out home equity loans to finance everything from college to renovations, and now they're finding they just don't have the options they once had." Numerous studies also show boomers don't have the retirement savings they need; a recent TD Ameritrade survey found that the average boomer is about a half-million dollars short. "This generation has expectations that exceed its wallet," says William Hardin, professor of finance and real estate at Florida International University. "The reality is that a lot of boomers are going to be faced with fewer choices." Even if Florida boomers have accumulated equity in their homes, downsizing may not make economic sense because of the Save Our Homes Amendment to the state constitution. It caps the increase in assessed value of homestead property at 3 percent per year, or the percent change in the Consumer Price Index, whichever is lower. While a 2008 portability law allows homeowners to transfer that accumulated homestead-exemption savings to a new place, those who have been in their homes for decades may end up paying higher taxes for a smaller place assessed at current market value. Pam and John Admire considered downsizing to a downtown Coral Gables condo from their three-bedroom Coral Gables house when they became empty nesters, but changed their minds when they ran the numbers. "I was ready to give up on the maintenance," says Pam Admire, 57, "but when we looked into it, the taxes on a smaller place were exorbitant. It just wasn't worth it." When boomers do move, they want a simpler lifestyle. "They don't want the responsibility of a pool, a yard, something more to take care of," Shuffield says. "They're done with that." Townhomes and condos often fit the bill. Two years ago, Silvia and Luis Moran sold their Kendall house with its big yard, Jacuzzi, butterfly garden and orchid house and bought, mortgage-free, a two-bedroom condo in West Kendall. It was difficult for the couple to leave their home of 30 years, but the savings were substantial, even when they took into account homeowner association fees. "We wanted to stay close by, near doctors and everything else," says Silvia, who is retiring later this year. (Husband Luis, 60, who has Parkinson's disease, has already left the workforce.) "But we also knew we wanted to simplify our lives. We positioned ourselves for the future." When you take into account taxes and insurance, affordability is a huge problem for those who want to stay here on a retirement income. "If you're not affluent, it's difficult to live in South Florida," FIU's Hardin says. "When you look at it, you can move and retire to less expensive places." The Carolinas, as well as Georgia and Tennessee, are growing in popularity, not only for those who used to retire to Florida but also those retiring from Florida. For some South Floridians, moving out can also mean going abroad, often back to Latin America. "The wealth you accumulate here goes a lot further there," Hardin says. If they move, boomers prefer urban areas and walkable communities where they can stay physically active long into retirement. That's what Russell Robertt wanted when he moved from his condo in the Dadeland area. At 49, the Miami native searched for a more affordable city where he could continue teaching until he retired. "I was looking down the road at what I was going to need," Robertt says. "I needed a bigger place so friends could visit, but I also wanted something that would allow me to save money for retirement." He found that in Atlanta. Though his building is in Buckhead, an uptown urban area, the gated community has a large, woodsy area for walking and hiking. "I just don't see myself in my 60s, sitting in my place watching TV all day. I want to be able to get out," Robertt says. Because many have cared for elderly parents, boomers also know to look for amenities that are easier on achy backs and creaky knees-- one-story homes with wide doors and hallways, accessible bathrooms, good lighting and "flex space" that adjusts to a homeowner's needs over time. And those with the resources are willing to pay for these amenities. "Boomers are more demanding than past generations," says Greene of Coldwell Banker. "They want the luxuries that make their lives easier, things like granite or marble, not mica." In the end, though, where a boomer grows old will depend in large part on what he or she can afford. "It's not just the desire," FIU's Hardin says, "it's the ability, and that picture is something that's still unfolding." ___ (c)2013 The Miami Herald Visit The Miami Herald at www.miamiherald.com Distributed by MCT Information Services 
WASHINGTON (AP) ó Wayne LaPierre would just as soon read a book as fire a gun. That's right, the National Rifle Association's fire-breathing defender of gun rights is more academic than marksman. "A policy wonk," says Joseph Tartaro, president of the pro-gun Second Amendment Foundation. "He is more professorial than you would think." "Wayne is a Washington-type person," says John Aquilino, a former NRA spokesman who worked with LaPierre. "He is best characterized as an absent-minded professor." A professor, that is, with a million-dollar megaphone and a well-honed ability to dish apocalyptic warnings about a tyrannical government angling to grab people's firearms. "It's about banning your guns ... PERIOD!" LaPierre wrote in a January email to the NRA's 4 million-plus members. For decades, LaPierre, 63, has been serving up heated us-vs.-them rhetoric to rally the NRA faithful. Usually it works; sometimes it backfires. There was his 1995 reference to federal law enforcement agents as "jack-booted government thugs." (He later apologized.) And his 2000 declaration that President Bill Clinton was "willing to accept a certain level of killing to further his political agenda." (No apology.) And his 2002 complaint that tougher airport screenings after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks signaled that "I guess it's OK to wand-rape someone's daughter in public." A week after the December school shooting in Newtown, Conn., LaPierre gave a fiery speech calling for armed guards in every school. He blamed violence on a culture that celebrates gory video games and "blood-soaked slasher films" and rewards killers with fame. "Gun nut!" the New York Post screamed on its front page. "The most revolting, tone-deaf statement I've ever seen," tweeted then-Rep. Chris Murphy, now a Democratic senator from Connecticut. "Call me crazy," LaPierre retorted on NBC's "Meet the Press." ''I think the American people think it's crazy not to do it," referring to armed school guards. In fact, a Washington Post/ABC News poll conducted in January found that 55 percent of Americans said they would support a law "placing an armed guard in every school in the country." In the weeks since Newtown, LaPierre has been the ever-present public face of gun-rights forces, shuttling between speeches, hearing rooms and TV studios to forcefully reject proposals for tighter gun controls as misguided ideas that will do nothing to stop criminals and everything to tangle law-abiding citizens in a bureaucratic nightmare. Jimmy Carter was president when LaPierre first went to work for the NRA in 1977, and for the past 22 years LaPierre has been the organization's executive vice president, steering it through a transformation from a clubby marksmanship group into a political movement adept at beating back efforts to tighten firearms regulations. Along the way, says Josh Sugarman, head of the pro-gun-control Violence Policy Center, LaPierre's tenure has been marked by a willingness to push the envelope with over-the-top language that casts the government as the enemy and stokes "fear-driven paranoia." LaPierre has been richly rewarded for his efforts: NRA tax returns show he earned $835,000 in salary and $126,000 in other compensation in 2010. For all of LaPierre's tough talk, friends and former colleagues describe a soft-spoken man who's a little scattered. Aquilino, the former NRA spokesman, remembers his former colleague oversleeping and missing a golf outing with Vice President Dan Quayle. Leaving a trail of dropped notebooks and papers on the path from his office to a cab. Sitting head in hands in an airport terminal, unable to remember what flight he was booked on. Aquilino says he once asked LaPierre what he wanted to do eventually and was told, "To tell the truth, I'd like to run an ice cream parlor in Maine." How does all of that square with LaPierre's combative reputation? "It's all done on purpose," says Grover Norquist, an anti-tax crusader and member of the NRA's board. "It's hard to say: 'The Second Amendment's in danger' and say it in a shy, soft-spoken way." Or, as LaPierre himself put it in a 2000 interview: "When I used less strong words for the last three years, everyone dozed off." No one snoozed in 1995 when LaPierre signed an NRA fundraising letter that accused the Clinton administration of empowering police to "murder law-abiding citizens" at will and described the ban on semi-automatic weapons as a law giving "jack-booted government thugs more power to take away our constitutional rights, break in our doors, seize our guns, destroy our property, and even injure or kill us." Even some NRA members were aghast. Former President George W. Bush very publicly quit the group. LaPierre at first defended the letter then offered a qualified apology. He'd slipped over the line from hard-nosed to incendiary in an episode that will always brand him. By those standards, his words have been generally more measured since. But when LaPierre speaks, those who watch him wonder what undercurrents he's tapping. The NRA's website describes LaPierre as "a skilled hunter, from Chesapeake waterfowl to African Cape buffalo." Online, there are lots of suit-and-tie photos of LaPierre, and a couple of hunting shots, including a picture of him next to a downed buffalo in Botswana. The NRA declined to make LaPierre available for an interview or to answer questions about him. But former colleagues say LaPierre didn't show great interest in shooting. And they're hard pressed to recall any LaPierre hobbies beyond devouring nonfiction. LaPierre is married but does not have children. "There was an opportunity for him to learn about firearms, and he certainly knows about them," says Tanya Metaksa, who hired LaPierre at the NRA and later worked under him. "But he's more the intellectual in his understanding of the history of the issue and the philosophical underpinnings of what it means to uphold the Second Amendment." LaPierre's path to the top of the NRA began with an interest in politics, not guns. Richmond attorney Tom Lisk grew up across the street from LaPierre in Roanoke, Va., and remembers him as an avid bowler, passionate about hockey and politics. As a teenager, LaPierre would take his young neighbor along to the bowling alley on Saturday mornings, and he'd hang out at Lisk's house to talk government with Lisk's father, who was on the city council. The NRA executive who's worked against many a Democratic presidential candidate over the years actually cut his teeth working for Democrat George McGovern's campaign in Roanoke back in 1972, when LaPierre was 22. LaPierre, who has a bachelor's degree from Siena College in Loudonville, N.Y., and a master's from Boston College, got a job early on as an aide to Vic Thomas, a pro-gun Democratic state legislator in Virginia. He worked on gun legislation for Thomas, and that led to his hiring by the NRA in 1978. Lisk, whom LaPierre later recommended for an NRA job, remembers LaPierre as "a person that people gravitated toward" at the organization. "Wayne wanted to be liked," says Lisk, noting that he'd send out for ice cream as the group's lobbyists met to decide which candidates would get campaign contributions. Richard Feldman, who worked with LaPierre at the NRA but later had a falling out and now runs the Independent Firearm Owners Association, says LaPierre's success as a lobbyist came in part from never saying "no" to those he might need. "Wayne's approach would be, 'That's a good idea. Yeah, I'm with you on that,'" says Feldman. "Meanwhile, he's doing everything around your back to kill it." After a surprisingly long run as the NRA's executive vice president, surviving insider plots along the way, LaPierre remains the hero to many a gun lover and villain to opponents. The sharpened battle lines since Newtown have made it easier for LaPierre to pitch his uncompromising message that gun owners must band together to fight liberal elites out to take their firearms. LaPierre has been here before. When he went before the Senate Judiciary Committee last month, one of the questioners was Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., his longtime nemesis on the subject of banning assault weapons. Feinstein welcomed the witnesses and made a point of saying, "Even you, Mr. LaPierre. It's good to see you again. I guess we tangled, what was it, 18 years ago? You look pretty good, actually." ___ Associated Press news researcher Monika Mathur and AP writer Calvin Woodward contributed to this report. ___ Follow Nancy Benac on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/nbenac Copyright (2013) Associated Press.

Flickr / aka KathThe ditching of government bonds in favour of shares has seen stock markets continue to rise, but experts are warning investors not to get too bullish about the ëgreat rotationí. Investors love a story. Look behind every persistent investment theme and you will find a compelling narrative ñ and usually a catchy slogan to go with it. So the "cult of the equity" marked the generational shift from bonds to equities in the Fifties, "TMT" became shorthand 15 years ago for investing in the so-called new economy and, in the week in which Jim O'Neill has left Goldman Sachs, we should not forget the "Brics", which became synonymous with emerging market investing. The latest addition to this list is the "great rotation". As with its predecessors, it has gained currency because it contains a germ of truth. Like the others, its significance is in danger of being overstated because of the ease with which it rolls off the tongue. The case for a rotation out of bonds and into equities is not hard to make. After a 30-year bull market, government bonds have risen to prices at which the income they offer investors no longer compensates them for the risks they take by holding them, nor in many cases even offsets the erosion of purchasing power caused by inflation. As Professor Paul Marsh of the London Business School said this week, "to extrapolate the high bond returns of the past 30 years into the future would be fantasy". As is the nature of bull markets, most of the money has flowed into the asset class in its latter stages, when the potential returns are least attractive. By contrast, equities have endured a 13-year bear market since the bursting of the dot.com bubble. As a consequence, they now offer investors a compelling investment case, with valuations at relatively low levels compared with the past 25 years and an inflation-beating income (with the potential for growth as an added bonus when compared with fixed-income bonds). After more than a decade of volatile returns, including two periods in which prices have halved, investors remain to be convinced by the case for investing in shares. This natural reticence has been compounded in the case of many institutional investors such as pensions funds by regulations demanding they hold less "risky" investments. This has led to UK pension funds holding as many bonds as equities for the first time in decades. There is some evidence these factors are beginning to influence investor behaviour. The monthly statistics from the Investment Management Association, for example, show that retail investors favoured equity funds over bonds in each of the four months between September and December last year. In the first eight months of 2012, they had shown a preference for bonds, by a wide margin in some cases. But the evidence is not wholly convincing that this represents the early stages of a great rotation. For one thing, the flows into bond funds remain positive, so the preference for equities could just as easily be attributed to a simple increase in appetite for investments of all kinds as sentiment improves. Fund-flow data from the US suggests the source of the money which has given Wall Street its strongest start to the year for more than a decade (more than 20 years in London) is actually money market and other cash funds and not bonds at all. It is the reinvestment of the many dividends paid out in December to beat feared fiscal cliff-related tax rises which has driven markets to a five-year high. This is not to dismiss the great rotation thesis. Equities look the more attractive asset class today and over time I would expect a rebalancing between bonds and equities. But with so much uncertainty, the prospect of interest rates remaining low at least through this year, a continuing regulatory impetus towards less volatile institutional funds and the ongoing value of holding a balanced portfolio, the transition may be more orderly than the "story" might suggest.

Andrew Burton/Getty Images)It was a sickening, gut-wrenching moment when, one evening in October 2012, Sally Donaldson checked her bank account and realised she had made the silliest financial mistake of her life. Two years earlier, hairdresser Sally had organised for her monthly pay, ¬£1,000, to be transferred from her HSBC account to the joint account at Nationwide building society she shares with her husband. But on that October night, the mother of two discovered she had made a simple but calamitous error. It's a mistake anyone can make.¬†To transfer money online from one account to another, you simply tap in the recipient's name, their sort code and account number. But Sally had incorrectly typed in just one of the eight digits in the account number ‚Äì and the money was sent to the wrong person. What makes her story so extraordinary, though, is that she made the mistake in May 2010. Every month since ‚Äì for more than two years ‚Äì her pay was going into someone else's Nationwide account. And now, to her horror, Sally is discovering she has almost no chance of getting back a penny of the ¬£26,650 transferred in error. The recipient took the money, spent it, and is refusing to repay it. Nationwide says there is nothing it can do ‚Äì and won't tell Sally who the recipient is because of data protection rules. The fact she correctly entered her surname as the intended recipient at Nationwide, alongside the correct sort code, counted for nothing. When banks transfer money, they use only the sort code and account number ‚Äì it turns out that account names are irrelevant. Legally, Sally has every right to demand the money back ‚Äì no one is entitled to keep money wrongly credited to their account. But getting it back is an altogether different matter. Many people will sympathise with her over a silly mistake. But most will also wonder how she and her husband failed to notice a missing ¬£1,000 every month. Indeed, Nationwide says it has never before come across a case of "mis-applied credit" that went on for so long. The answer may lie in the widespread switch to paperless statements, where an account can only be viewed online. Sally did not see a bank statement from Nationwide for the entire period the money was going astray. She kept an eye on the balance when she took money out at the ATM, but that was about all, while her husband, who also paid his income into the account, sorted out most of the bills. "It wasn't until October 2012 that I discovered the ¬£1,000 was not showing on our joint account's monthly statement. Having moved over to paperless statements in 2010, I had been checking that my wages were leaving my business account held with HSBC at the end of every month. However, to my horror, I now saw they had never arrived in our joint Nationwide account. Scrolling back, the last time my wage appeared on our statement was May 2010. "I frantically checked my numbers for the bill payment scheme I had set up with HSBC and could see that, on setting it up, I was one digit out ‚Ä¶ the money has been going to another Nationwide account holder for the past two years, amounting to ¬£26,650! "The payment was set up clearly to my name, my sort code but with one account number digit being incorrect. "Phone calls to Nationwide that night, many tears and numerous subsequent calls and letters, have left us with just ¬£1,000 returned and a complete blank of information from Nationwide," she says. Sally is not her real name, as she wishes to remain anonymous. "We have been reluctant to tell anyone we know about the error, so have dwelled heavily on it ourselves. It leaves a sick feeling in my stomach to think someone has been spending all that hard-earned money and I've been going to work ‚Äì running my own hairdresser's business ‚Äì when I could have been enjoying a little more time at home with my two sons." Sally is not rich. They live in a modest semi, her husband works in the public sector, and they have a joint income of less than ¬£50,000. "We live a simple life; we are quite frugal. We even went overdrawn on that account for a while and cut back as a result." But what about the lucky recipient of Sally's income? Is there really nothing Nationwide can do to recover the money? The building society says that where money has gone into the wrong account, the law entitles it to take it out again without seeking permission first, up to six years after the credit is wrongly entered. But in Sally's case, the recipient had withdrawn the money through ATMs, so Nationwide could not grab it back. "By law, a person is not entitled to rely on another's mistake to keep money to which they were not entitled," a Nationwide spokesman says. But he adds: "The final payment transferred was recovered, but previous payments were no longer in the account. The recipient has been contacted and we have established she doesn't have the funds to repay." Can Nationwide at least see where the recipient transferred the money to? "Unfortunately, there is no trail. The receiving customer simply made regular cash withdrawals rather than transferring monies to another account." Neither Nationwide or HSBC is prepared to reimburse Sally. They both argue the mistake was the customer's, and that there is a risk of fraud if they were to make repayments to people who credit the wrong account. Data protection rules make life even more difficult for Sally. Nationwide can only release the name of the recipient if Sally obtains a court order. Sally will then have to decide if it is worth paying to take legal action. The Financial Ombudsman Service says it receives about 100 complaints regarding mis-applied credit every year, mostly from individuals who have seen money come into their account and want to keep it. The ombudsman nearly always rules against them; just because the bank made a mistake does not mean you can keep the cash. Sally is considering taking her case to the ombudsman, but it says she may not have much joy‚Äì it can only rule if the banks acted improperly, and can't take action against the recipient. If there is a wider lesson in Sally's story, it is not to agree to paperless statements. In November 2012, RBS/NatWest became the first bank to stop posting monthly statements, instead opting for statements every three months. Other banks are expected to follow suit. Critics say going paperless increases the chances that charging blunders, unexpected debits and fraud will go undetected for months on end.  This article originally appeared on guardian.co.uk

Photo by Mario Tama/Getty ImagesA man operates a snowblower while a blizzard arrives in the Back Bay neighborhood on February 8, 2013 in Boston, Massachusetts. Boston was expected to be hit by three feet of snow, topping the city's previous record fall of 27 inches. Hundreds of thousands of people on the US east coast lost power, while airlines cancelled more than 5,000 flights, as the storm battered states and provinces from New Jersey into Canada . More than 650,000 homes and businesses are without power, according to The New York Times. As roads became increasingly dangerous, the storm's first two deaths in car crashes were reported in Canada. The chaos seemed certain to worsen later on Saturday as winds gusting past 70 mph whipped up drifts of up to six feet deep, with heavier snowfall predicted for several more hours. Tidal surges were also expected to pound ashore in coastal regions that were devastated by superstorm Sandy barely three months ago. Yet even as Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island took the unprecedented measure of banning private vehicles from roads and several governors declared states of emergency, in Manhattan the world's fashion elite defiantly insisted that, on Friday night at least, the shows must go on. New York fashion week, one of the most important dates in the industry's calendar, is in full swing this weekend. And even as the snow swirled, female models swapped stilettos for snow-boots and flats and guests bundled themselves up in double coats as they made their way to runway shows. "I'm wearing flats," said jewelry designer Mona Assemi, a note of wonder in her voice as she looked down at her feet. The self-described Washington-based "fashionista" said she is "always in heels" but had decided to be sensible in the face of the blizzard named "Nemo" by The Weather Channel. Bundled up in a heavy coat, a fur hat and a cashmere scarf draped around her face like a balaclava, she was slowly making her way through driving wet snow to New York's Lincoln Centre, headquarters of fashion week. While the massive storm shut down airports, closed schools and businesses and sent most people scurrying for cover, fashion industry insiders were determined not to let a little snow deter them. As two Bobcat snow-ploughs whirled noisily around the Lincoln Centre plaza, trying to keep the snow at bay, glamorous guests gingerly picked their way through the icy slush to the hall where the American designer Nicole Miller was showing on Friday evening. Miss Assemi was one of many in the fashionable crowd who had not completely sacrificed style for function. Her boots, she said, were Yves St Laurent in black patent "and they're actually very comfortable". Isaiah Isaac, an accessories designer and a writer for The Fashion List website, noted that some shows were less crowded than normal. "There've been a few empty seats because I think some people's flights were cancelled but it's all still more or less going ahead," he said. Underneath his red coat, he was wearing two sweaters, a shirt and a vest -- though he said he had drawn the line at putting on long johns. "Not a lot of people are dressing down," he said. "They're still tip-toeing around in their heels. In fact, it's been the highlight of my day, watching them. It's really quite funny." Texan fashion fans Courtney Kerr and Shannon Yoachum held on to each other and kept their heads down in the near white-out conditions. Although unused to this type of weather, the pair were determined to go to all the shows. "We don't sacrifice for fashion! Beauty is pain!" they squealed. Fashion blogger Margie Ashcroft scoffed at the idea of Nemo making a dent in New York Fashion Week. "This is our livelihood, what we wait around for all year," she said. "We're not going to let a little bit of bad weather stop us." She had, however, noticed more Escalades around as a mode of transport. "People are calling up and using their car services," she said. The blizzard did force fashion designer Michael Kors to wear Uggs to travel to his Project Runway fashion show. "I came in looking like Pam Anderson," he joked to journalists, before changing into more tasteful leather boots. But most fashion observers thought the appalling weather was a chance to dress warmly but stylishly. "Crushing on the coat-over-coat layered look!" tweeted one fashion show attendee. Shops and fuel stations witnessed panic buying, not least in New York and New Jersey where memories of the havoc wrought by superstorm Sandy are still deeply-etched. By the time the storm passes through on Saturday, forecasters predicted snowfall in New York City of 10 to 14 inches; 24 inches in Connecticut; and the record-breaking tallies in Boston. The "monster storm" is the product of two weather systems smashing together -- one powering down on the Arctic jet stream from Canada while the other was a winter "nor'easter" barreling in from the North Atlantic. "The storm should reach its peak intensity early Saturday morning just east of Cape Cod," the National Weather Service predicted. In New England, residents were braced for a storm worst than the infamous 1978 blizzard that dumped 27 inches of show and was blamed for dozens of deaths.
