REUTERS/Brendan McDermidTobias Levkovich, CitiFinally, President Obama has signed into law an agreement that will raise the U.S. debt ceiling and end the government shutdown. Optimism for a deal ignited a major rally in the stock markets, which are once again within reach of all-time highs. But in a brief 7-page note to clients, Citi's Tobias Levkovich warns us that averting disaster should not be confused with having solved the problem. "The latest agreement though, only punts an immediate risk to a few short months away and thus should not give rise to much optimism," wrote Levkovich, Citi's Chief U.S. Equity Strategist. "Yet, the VIX has dropped back to below 15 from more than 20, illustrating some element of new complacency settling in." Here's the key paragraph: Kicking the proverbial can down the street does not address the long-term fiscal imbalances. The twin decisions of a taper timing push out and the discord in Washington being swept under the rug until January and February roll in could keep P/E multiples more compressed as equity risk premiums stay elevated. Investors typically do not like uncertainty and it is hard to determine how these recent almost non-decisions can be seen as reinvigorating confidence aside from some relief that an imminent likely disaster has been avoided. Nonetheless, one cannot respectably believe that things truly have turned for the better as opposed to averting the worst. The long-term growth of non-discretionary government spending can still prove to be an overwhelming liability and it has not been the primary focus for legislators. Citi Research"A Senate led proposal to delay the CR (thereby ending the government shutdown) and defer the debt ceiling is not truly addressing the huge problems facing the country on government spending for non-discretionary items (see Figure 1) like welfare and health care given the large number of aging Americans," expanded Levkovich. So, as long as the long-term problems go unresolved and unaddressed, stocks won't be able to realize their full bull market potential. Levkovich sees the S&amp;P 500 ending the year at 1,650.
APPresident Barack Obama urged Congress to "get out of the habit of governing by crisis," delivering a statement from the White House Wednesday night as an end to Washington's budget latest crises looms.  Obama's statement came just after the Senate passed a bill Wednesday night to fund the government through Jan. 15, 2014, and suspend the nation's debt limit through Feb. 7. It now heads to the House of Representatives, where it is expected to pass with mostly Democratic votes.  Obama thanked leaders from both parties for coming to a deal that ends the government shutdown and raises the debt ceiling. "Hopefully next time it won't be in the 11th hour," Obama said in very brief remarks from the White House briefing room.  Obama pledged to sign the legislation "immediately" upon it reaching his desk, and he said that the process of reopening the federal government after a 16-day shutdown would begin "immediately," as well. Obama will speak at 10:35 a.m. ET on Thursday to make a statement on the agreement and on future budget issues. At the end of his statement, a reporter shouted at Obama, "Isn't this going to happen all over again in a few months?" "No," Obama said, laughing.
Studies show that it is very difficult for investors to outperform the market.   This is something that has been argued at the theoretical level by believers of the efficient market hypothesis (EMH), an idea advanced by University of Chicago professor Eugene Fama. On Monday, Fama was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics for his work in this area. Beating the benchmark becomes even more difficult net of fees, which is what comes with buying a mutual fund that aims to outperform. Vanguard's Jack Bogle has been saying this for fifty years. Today, Amanda Schneider and the Goldman Sachs equity strategy team published an analysis of mutual fund performance. Among other things, Schneider found that most large-cap mutual funds were once again underperforming the S&amp;P 500. Her sample consisted of 232 large-cap core funds with $580 billion of assets under management.  Here's more info about the sample: Mutual funds invest an average of 89% of their common stock in S&amp;P 500 stocks and 6% other US stocks. International stocks, including ADRs, represent 5% of common stock holdings: 3% Western Europe, 1% Canada, and 1% other. The average fund holds 4.0% of assets in non-stock holdings. "46% of funds have outperformed the S&amp;P 500 year-to-date," she said. For what it's worth, this is above the ten-year average of 36%. And almost 60% of funds outperformed in the third quarter. Will this be on of the rare years where most mutual funds beat the benchmark? Goldman Sachs
REUTERSSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell announced aÂ deal to raise the nation's debt ceiling and end the federal government shutdown on the Senate floor Wednesday afternoon. In a statement on Wednesday afternoon, House Speaker John Boehner confirmed that House Republicans won't block passage of the deal,Â thereby clearing the way for the federal government to reopen and for the U.S. to raise its debt ceiling. Reid called the deal a "historic bipartisan agreement." The legislation, which was released Wednesday afternoon, willÂ fund the government through mid-January and raise the debt ceiling through Feb. 7. A separate agreement among leaders sets up budget conference on long-term fiscal issues that would end no later than Dec. 13. The bill will also includeÂ an income-verification system for individuals and families receiving subsidies through the Affordable Care Act.Â In short, the Secretary of Human Health Services will submit a report no later than Jan. 1 detailing the verification process. The department's inspector general will submit to Congress no later than July a report on the effectiveness of those procedures.Â  And in what was a key priority for the White House, theÂ Treasury Department will still be able to use "extraordinary measures" to work around the debt ceiling in the case that it is not raised by Feb. 7.Â  "The compromise we reached will provide our economy with the stability it desperately needs," Reid said on the Senate floor. McConnell spoke in a more somber tone on the floor after Reid, but he also hailed the fact that the deal keeps in place the across-the-board spending cuts of the sequester. "For today, the relief we hope for is to reopen the government, avoid default, and protect the historic cuts we achieved under the [Budget Control Act]," McConnell said of the bill that came out of the 2011 debt-ceiling crisis. "This is far less than many of us had hoped for. But itâ€™s far better than what some had sought.Â Now itâ€™s time for Republicans to unite behind our other crucial goals." Boehner said in his statement that the House had done everything it could to fight Obamacare.Â  "That fight will continue. But blocking the bipartisan agreement reached today by the members of the Senate will not be a tactic for us," Boehner said in the statement. REUTERSSen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) told reporters shortly after the deal was announced that he does not intend to delay passage of the Senate legislation. He said that it's a time for Republicans to announce "where they stand" on the Affordable Care Act, but that he never had any intention of delaying what has become inevitable. "There's nothing to be gained from delaying this vote one day or two days," Cruz said. A Senate Democratic leadership aide said that the Senate will act first on the legislation â€” likely sometime late this afternoon or early this evening. Then the House will act afterward. The White House applauded the Senate deal, and Press Secretary Jay Carney said that Obama commended both Reid and McConnell for working to forge an agreement. But Carney didn't say whether the White House expected a vote in both chambers Wednesday.Â  "We are not putting odds on anything," Carney said. He added that Obama expected Congress to "act swiftly."
The billionaire Mark Cuban had harsh words for the SEC on Wednesday after a jury ended a five-year legal battle by finding he wasn't liable for insider trading. "This is a horrific example of how government does work," Cuban said. "I won't be bullied," he added, "I don't care care if it's the federal government." Cuban was accused in the civil suit of selling shares in a company called Mamma.com in 2004 after the CEO's company told him he was offering new stock and diluting Cuban's shares. He says he did nothing illegal, and there were many reasons he sold his shares — including the company's ties with a stock swindler, Reuters reported. Cuban avoided $750,000 in losses, though, and the SEC wanted him to give up that money and pay a civil penalty, too. The billionaire Dallas Mavericks owner told reporters Wednesday that he ended up spending more on his defense than he would have paid in SEC fines, but he said he was glad to "be the person who can afford to stand up to them." Cuban attacked the SEC for failing to work with companies to help them understand how to comply with securities laws. "They regulate through litigation," he said, "and that's its own problem."

What An 18th Century Swiss Physicist Can Teach Us About Proper Decision Making (The Financialist) Credit Suisse Global Financial Strategy Chief Michael Mauboussin gives a brief lecture about why Swiss physicist Daniel Bernoulli can help us make better decisions: whereas, for millennia, man kept trying to reproduce flight through simple observation and classification (i.e. "birds fly, so a flying machine should have feathers), Bernoulli went back and figured out flight's root cause: fluid dynamics. At that point, it was only a matter of time before someone like the Wright Brothers figured out a way to put his theory into practice. For investors, the key is to efficiently get through the first two stages of discovery to make it to the third stage: definition, or causality.   The Dow Theory Has Still Not Flashed Its Sell Signal (MarketWatch) Dow Theory adherents rely on the Dow Industrials average confirming retracements in the Dow Transports average (and vice-versa) to make market decisions. Given that both have seen recent corrections, one might think we are near a sell signal. Not so, says Marketwatch's Mark Hulbert:  "...we’re still a long ways from a sell signal. The next step would be for either one or both Dow averages to fail to surpass their September closing highs (15,676.04 for the Industrials and 6,726.94 for the Transports) and then both break below their Oct. 8 closing lows (14,776.53 and 6,446.75, respectively). ... therefore, we can wait and let the market tell its story. In the meantime, because the Dow Theory assumes that the most recent signal remains in place until overturned, the Dow Theory remains bullish." Further Evidence That Housing Is Cooling Off (Wall Street Journal) This week, we gave you anecdotal evidence for why the housing market was slowing down: "serious" homebuyers appear to have replaced investors or flippers as the market's main drivers. Today, we got more data showing this is happening on a national scale. According to real estate data firm Redfin, formal offers for homes declined -11.8% in September. That's the largest drop-off of 2013 — and nowhere near the 4.5% gain seen last September. “Our clients are concerned about fluctuating mortgage rates as well as the government shutdown and debt ceiling battle. When people feel uncertain about their wealth and the economy, buying a home falls to the bottom of their to-do list,” Redfin's New York manager said in a press release. Since At Least 1988, Expanding Growth + Falling Inflation = Stick With Stocks (Russ Koesterich) The following table from a forthcoming paper by BlackRock's Russ Koesterich indicates that since 1988, stocks have outperformed bonds when there's been high growth and non-existent inflation: Koesterich He writes: "today’s environment... should be good for both developed and emerging market stocks, although the performance of the latter will be somewhat dependent on the future path of monetary policy. As we write in the paper, my research team has found that the sweet spot for (monthly) developed equity performance has been a combination of global economic expansion and declining US inflation. Meanwhile, emerging market stocks generally tend to perform best in environments of falling inflation." It May Not Be As Exciting, But Only Day Traders Should Care About The Headlines (Advisors Capital Management) If you tried to make financial decisions based on the drips of information coming out of Washington for the past two weeks and you weren't a day trader, you've made a huge mistake. "...investors can inflict great harm on themselves by reacting to the news, if they fail to get out and also get back in at precisely the right time. Being off by a mere 15 seconds on either side of the trade can be very costly. The discussions are taking place behind closed doors, and leaks of progress or failure can occur at any time with no notice and move the market up or down quite sharply. So, it is very easy to get whipsawed by the latest developments. In contrast, being invested and staying the course hurts only if a serious default is allowed to occur."

REUTERS/Ernest ScheyderA well operated by Chesapeake Energy Corp is seen extracting natural gas from the Marcellus shale formation in Sayre, Pennsylvania, August 12, 2013. The natural gas production boom out of the Pennsylvania portion of the Marcellus Shale has transformed the market.Â  But some have questioned how long it can last. In a new note, Morgan Stanley says the Marcellus is about to experience a second wind, with 2014 production increasing by 2.2 billion cubic feet per day to about 70 bcf/d: "Since 2010, weâ€™ve seen well costs fall betweenÂ 7.5% and 35%, unit costs are down 13%-38%, and EURs up 25%. Given the historical progress, we would be hesitant to betÂ against further efficiency gains. While we donâ€™t expect a repeat of the past three years,Â an incremental 10% improvementÂ doesnâ€™t seem unreasonable." However, they also argue demand will remain stagnant: "The Mercury and Air Toxics Standards [which will cut into coal production to the benefit of natural gas â€” BI] will not come into effect until Apr. 2015. LNG exports will not materialize until late 2015. Many of the new energy-intensive industrial projects are expected to come online post-2015." As a result, they're revising their price forecasts downward: "We now expect Henry Hub prices will average $3.50/mmBtu for 2014 and $4/mmBtu for 2015. Material demand growth should not materialize before 2017, limiting any large upward move in pricing in the interim. We are also reducing our long-term price forecast to $4.25/mmBtu, as continued efficiency gains and a likely recovery in NGL prices later in the decade should continue to drive the cost curve lower."Â  And all this has negative implications for coal:Â  "We expect weak gas basis relative to Henry Hub to spread though PA, NJ, WV and even Ohio and Downstate NY in 2014, reducing capacity factors at coal plants in these regions. We see ~8mm tons decrease in [Midwest] coal burn in 2014 relative to 2013. Here's their chart showing natgas versus coal: Morgan Stanley Boom.
Brett LoGiurato/Business InsiderTRENTON, Fla. — Todd Newtown, the clerk of the Circuit Court in this tiny Florida town, is at a bit of a loss as to where he'd like to see the federal government cut spending.  This is the basis of his argument for not being in favor of raising the nation's debt ceiling — something that economists say would risk a default on U.S. obligations, as well as major economic calamity. The U.S. has avoided that prospect with a deal between Senate leaders on Wednesday. But when asked, specifically, where the government can cut, Newton is either unprepared or simply doesn't know.  "We're spending $300 or $500 on hammers," Newtown said, adding that he believes the U.S. should appoint some sort of independent watchdog to manage cuts.  Newton probably doesn't know it, but what he's referring to is almost 20 years in the past — and is owed largely to an accounting quirk, rather than wasteful government spending. Newtown exemplifies an odd predicament for those who are willing to risk it all, economically, and go to the brink over spending cuts: Where do we trim? During a recent trip to Florida's Third Congressional district, which is represented by Rep. Ted Yoho (R), constituents had three main targets. The first was foreign aid, which was by far the most popular response among the dozens of people interviewed during the trip.  Foreign aid makes up less than 1% of a massive $3 trillion-plus federal budget.  "Doesn't matter," said David Biddle, a state committeeman in the Florida GOP. "Stop sending it abroad, and start taking care of our own." Biddle doesn't believe that the U.S. should raise its borrowing limit. He theorizes that there is enough revenue coming in every day that it would force Washington to make tough spending choices on the fly.What to cut, then? Medicare? Social Security? Those programs won't be cut and, according to Biddle, anyone who suggests it is employing "scare tactics." With Biddle, you start with foreign aid. Then, "you can cut, you know, federal arts ..." Biddle said.  "There are a lot of grants," added Bob Clemons, a director of finance for the local school board. "Grants. There's a lot of grants," Biddle said. The two paused for about 10 seconds. "It's a big problem," Clemons said.  "It is. It is," Biddle said. This conversation is a microcosm of others in the district. Caroline Vickers, a Trenton resident, thinks the government is giving "too much money to illegal aliens." At least eight people want to completely gut the welfare system. Nine others want to cut food stamps — some just a trim, others close to fully. Casey Mitchell, a livestock inspector for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, takes it a step further. He said that the federal government should stop providing disaster aid for natural disasters, like Hurricane Sandy. Aid should still be allocated for disasters like the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, he said. Biddle comes back a little while later after an initial conversation. He says that the government shutdown has helped show that there can be significant cuts in the federal workforce. "There are no non-essential employees in the private sector," he said. Still, the S&amp;P said Wednesday that the government shutdown has taken out $24 billion from the U.S. economy. And it has cut 0.6% off of yearly fourth quarter GDP growth.
Brown Harris StevensJon Stryker, a philanthropist and heir to a surgical and hospital supply fortune, is selling his duplex penthouse overlooking Central Park for $48 million, according to celebrity real estate blog The Real Estalker. The 5,600-square-foot apartment is at the top of the PrÃ¡sadÃ¡ building on New York's 65th Street and Central Park West. Stryker originally paid $12.8 million for the two neighboring apartments back in 2002, which was at that time the most expensive apartment purchase in the history of the Upper West Side.

APThe S&amp;P has cut the annualized U.S. growth view closer to 2% from 3%, Bloomberg is reporting. The ratings agency â€” which recognizes the Senate deal will be approved â€” says that the shutdown has taken $24 billion out of the economy and cut 0.6% off of yearly fourth quarter GDP growth. "If people are afraid that the government policy brinkmanship will resurface again, and with it the risk of another shutdown or worse, they'll remain afraid to open up their checkbooks. That points to another Humbug holiday season," S&amp;P wrote in a release. They also said the impact of the debt ceiling is getting worse by the day for the U.S. economy. Here's the full release: NEW YORK (Standard &amp; Poor's) Oct. 16, 2013--The U.S. government has been shut down for more than two weeks. Earlier today, Senate leadership crafted an agreement to end the shutdown and avert a debt default. However, the dealÂ needs to be voted on by both chambers of Congress. We believe that to date, the shutdown has shaved at least 0.6% off of annualized fourth-quarter 2013 GDP growth, or taken $24 billion out of the economy. However, the closer we get to breaching the debt ceiling, the higher we expect the economic impact to be. In the summer of 2011, as we approached the last debt ceiling standoff, consumer confidence plummeted and hit a 31-year low in August when the debt ceiling issue came to a head. Given that this round of debt-ceiling negotiations is occurring after two-plus weeks of a government shutdown, the total impact on the economy will likely be even more severe. While we believe the Senate deal will be passed and the debt ceiling will be raised, the impact of a default by the U.S. government on its debts would be devastating for markets and the economy and worse than the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. Should a default occur, the resulting sudden, unplanned contraction of current spending could see government spending cut by about 4% of annualized GDP. That would put the economy in a recession and wipeout much of the economic progress made by the recovery from the Great Recession. As we've said, we expect the Senate deal to be approved. However, the current chatter coming out of Washington suggests that any continuing resolution will be a temporary one, with an early 2014 timeframe for the next set of Washington deadlines. The short turnaround for politicians to negotiate some sort of lasting deal will likely weigh on consumer confidence, especially among government workers that were furloughed. If people are afraid that the government policy brinkmanship will resurface again, and with it the risk of another shutdown or worse, they'll remain afraid to open up their checkbooks. That points to another Humbug holiday season. The bottom line is the government shutdown has hurt the U.S. economy. In September, we expected 3% annualized growth in the fourth quarter because we thought politicians would have learned from 2011 and taken steps to avoid things like a government shutdown and the possibility of a sovereign default. Since our forecast didn't hold, we now have to lower our fourth-quarter growth estimate to closer to 2%.

Wall Street expected revenue to be flat at $24.75 billion while per-share earnings were expected to grow 9.3% to $3.96. Stock is dropping in after hours trading, down almost 5%. This is an important quarter for CEO Ginni Rometty. The year so far has been mixed. Last quarter, IBM missed on revenues, but beat on profits. And before that, IBM posted its worst quarter in years, missing on both revenue and earnings. That was the first revenue miss for 31 straight quarters dating back to early 2005, according to the Wall Street Journal. Thanks to those results, IBM instituted layoffs layoffs last quarter. It didn't say how many people it would cut, or where, but some analysts put the number at between 6,000 and 8,000. IBM had aboutÂ 434,246 people in its workforce worldwide in 2012. The company had reportedly tried to sell its server businesses to the Lenovo Group, too, but the deal fell through. In the press release, Rometty acknowledged that revenue "fell short" and said, "We are taking action to improve execution in our growth markets unit and in the elements of our hardware businesses that are under performing."

NBCMark Cuban â€” the billionaire owner of the Dallas Mavericks â€” has been found not liable of insider trading by a federal jury, the AP is reporting. Cuban was accused of selling his shares in an internet company called mamma.com in 2004 based on private information relayed to him from the CEO, avoiding $750,000 in losses. The SEC was searching for a civil penalty. The AP described the crux of the case weeks ago: The SEC's key piece of evidence is a phone call between Cuban and the CEO of Mamma.com. According to the SEC, the CEO told Cuban he had confidential information to share and Cuban agreed to keep it to himself. When the CEO said the company planned an offering of new stock, the SEC alleges, Cuban became angry because the offering would reduce the value of his 600,000 shares â€” and there was nothing he could do about it. "Well now I'm screwed. I can't sell," Cuban said, according to the SEC. But over the following two days, that's exactly what Cuban did, unloading his shares before the company publicly announced the stock offering. Cuban had argued that he never agreed to confidentiality, and that insider trading laws did not restrict him from unloading his shares.
Wikimedia CommonsThe Federal Reserve's Beige Book is out, featuring anecdotes collected by the Fed's regional banks. "Contacts across Districts generally remained cautiously optimistic in their outlook for future economic activity, although many also noted an increase in uncertainty due largely to the federal government shutdown and debt ceiling debate," according to the report. The Boston Fed reported, "Firms doing business with the government have been affected by the sequester; other firms are also concerned about potential effects of the government shutdown on consumer demand or broader economic effects of hitting the debt ceiling." Here's the full release: Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggest that national economic activity continued to expand at a modest to moderate pace during the reporting period of September through early October. Eight Districts reported similar growth rates in economic activity as during the previous reporting period, while growth slowed some in the Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts. Contacts across Districts generally remained cautiously optimistic in their outlook for future economic activity, although many also noted an increase in uncertainty due largely to the federal government shutdown and debt ceiling debate. Consumer spending continued to increase and activity in the travel and tourism sector expanded in most Districts. Business spending and payrolls grew in many Districts. Demand for nonfinancial services rose, and manufacturing activity also expanded modestly. Residential construction continued to increase at a moderate pace. By comparison, nonresidential construction again expanded at a slower rate. Residential and commercial real estate activity varied across Districts, but largely continued to improve. Financial conditions were little changed on balance, with lending activity remaining modest in most Districts. There were mixed reports on agriculture, with excess precipitation and drought both impacting the sector. Energy and mining activity expanded or maintained high levels, with the exception of the coal industry in the eastern half of the nation. Price and wage pressures were again limited. Consumer Spending and TourismConsumer spending grew modestly in most Districts. Auto sales continued to be strong, particularly in the New York District where they were said to be increasingly robust. In contrast, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas indicated slower growth in auto sales in September. Growth in retail sales was steady in most of the Districts, but picked up some in Cleveland and Richmond and slowed in Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas. Contacts in Chicago and Atlanta noted that back-to-school spending was lower than a year ago. However, retailers generally remained optimistic about the holiday shopping season, with contacts in Philadelphia and Chicago expecting this year's holiday sales to be about equal to last year's despite the traditional holiday period being six days shorter this year. In addition, Dallas noted strength in retail imports in advance of the holiday season, with growth stronger than a year ago. Activity in the travel and tourism sector also expanded in most areas, with the reports from the Atlanta, Boston, and New York Districts being particularly upbeat. Dallas indicated that airline passenger demand slowed seasonally, but was slightly stronger than year-ago levels. Tourism contacts in the Boston District were concerned about the potential impact of a protracted federal government shutdown; and Richmond noted that the shutdown had led to the closing of some tourist attractions, although hotel contacts indicated that these closures did not result in guest cancellations. In addition, Kansas City noted lower tourism activity due in part to the severe effects of recent flooding in Colorado. Business Spending and HiringBusiness spending grew modestly in most Districts. Overall, inventory investment proceeded at a moderate rate. Retail inventories were said to be in-line with sales in the Boston, Cleveland, Chicago, and Dallas Districts. Philadelphia and Cleveland reported that inventories were on the low side at auto dealers, and Chicago noted the same was true at steel service centers. Philadelphia reported an increase in manufacturers' demand for equipment, while manufacturers in Cleveland and Chicago indicated that current capital outlays were primarily for productivity enhancing investments. Cleveland noted that low natural gas prices and regulatory uncertainty were slowing the build-out of shale-gas transport and processing infrastructure. In contrast, additional infrastructure projects to support natural resource extraction were mentioned in the Richmond, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts. Philadelphia and Chicago reported an increase in spending on information technology. Looking ahead, several Districts noted an improvement in capital spending plans. Manufacturers in Philadelphia and St. Louis, high-tech service firms in Kansas City, and retailers in the Cleveland and St. Louis Districts expected to increase capital spending in the months ahead. Technology contacts in San Francisco relayed expectations for a near-term pick-up in spending on both hardware and software products. In addition, Philadelphia and Minneapolis reported slight increases in activity at architecture firms. Employment growth remained modest in September. Several Districts reported that contacts were cautious to expand payrolls, citing uncertainty surrounding the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and fiscal policy more generally. Cleveland and Dallas noted that retail hiring was primarily limited to staffing of new stores in their Districts, while contacts in Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Chicago reported that hiring for the holiday season would be about the same as last year. In manufacturing, Boston indicated that hiring primarily was for replacement or to fill key needs, New York noted slower job growth, and Chicago reported that manufacturers were cutting back on overtime. Dallas cited scattered reports of hiring in high-tech, fabricated metals, and food manufacturing. Furthermore, demand for skilled labor remained high in many Districts. Examples included technology, healthcare, and engineering occupations in Richmond, economic and health consulting in Boston, legal and compliance positions in the financial services industry in New York, and accountants and financial analysts in the Dallas District. Nonfinancial ServicesDemand for nonfinancial services increased modestly from the prior reporting period. Boston reported robust growth in consulting, but noted that activity at a government consulting firm remained weaker due to the effects of sequestration. The Minneapolis District reported increased activity in professional business services, whereas demand was more mixed in the Dallas District with strength in accounting services and a modest decrease in legal services. Demand for staffing services increased in the New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Minneapolis Districts, with New York citing strong demand for information technology occupations and Cleveland highlighting healthcare and manufacturing. In contrast, staffing service activity was down slightly in the Chicago and Dallas Districts. Demand for technology services increased in the Kansas City and San Francisco Districts, but San Francisco indicated that overall demand for nonfinancial services was mixed with healthcare services somewhat weak. Demand for transportation services increased on balance. Port activity remained robust in the Richmond and Atlanta Districts, reflecting exports of grain, auto parts, and forest products and imports of energy products and steel. Atlanta, Kansas City and Dallas cited a modest rise in demand for transportation services. Cleveland reported that the rate of growth in shipping freight volume had slowed recently, and demand for trucking services softened slightly in the Richmond District. ManufacturingOverall, manufacturing activity expanded modestly in September, but with some notable exceptions among the Districts. Cleveland, St. Louis, and Minneapolis experienced faster growth, while New York, Richmond, and Chicago saw growth weaken. The automotive and aerospace industries continued to be a source of strength in a number of Districts. Demand for fabricated metals was mixed in the Chicago and Richmond Districts, but stronger in the Dallas District. Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, and San Francisco reported steady increases in the demand for steel; Cleveland, Chicago, and Atlanta indicated that much of the higher demand was being met by imports. Demand for construction materials remained strong for Philadelphia, increased for Cleveland and San Francisco, was flat for Dallas, and was slightly lower for the Chicago District. Cleveland and Dallas reported strong demand for manufactured inputs to energy production, and demand for heavy equipment improved slightly in the Richmond and Chicago Districts. High-tech manufacturing activity edged up in a number of Districts, with Boston and Dallas reporting slightly higher demand for semiconductors, and biotech manufacturing increasing in San Francisco. While there was little immediate disruption from the federal government shutdown, contacts were worried about the potential impact if the closing became prolonged. Construction and Real EstateConstruction and real estate activity continued to improve in September. Residential construction increased moderately on balance, growing at a stronger pace in the Minneapolis and Dallas Districts but only slightly in Richmond and Philadelphia. Multifamily construction remained stronger than single-family construction in a number of Districts. Residential real estate activity continued to improve at a moderate pace in most Districts, as home sales and prices continued to rise and inventories remained low. Home sales in the New York and Dallas Districts were strong, with the exception of the Jersey Shore, which is still recovering from Hurricane Sandy. The Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Chicago Districts experienced a more modest improvement in home sales. A number of Districts reported concerns from homebuilders and realtors over rising mortgage rates. However, contacts in the Dallas District indicated that rising interest rates were not hurting affordability and contacts in the Boston District suggested some boost to activity by homebuyers entering the market in anticipation of future increases in rates. Nonresidential construction activity remained modest, but varied by market and District. Growth was strong in the Minneapolis District, but up only slightly in Richmond, Atlanta, and Philadelphia. The Cleveland, Chicago, and St. Louis Districts reported increased activity for industrial building, Cleveland noted strong demand from the healthcare sector, and redevelopment of vacant retail space picked up in Boston. Leasing activity continued to improve modestly in most Districts, but was particularly strong in the Dallas District. A number of Districts reported that vacancy rates continued to fall, rents rose, and the outlook for commercial real estate was generally positive. Banking and FinanceFinancial conditions were little changed on balance from the prior reporting period. Overall loan growth remained modest in most Districts. Consumer loan demand weakened slightly. Reports on mortgage lending were mixed. Several Districts noted a decrease in mortgage lending, citing higher mortgage rates and reduced refinancing activity. However, mortgage originations continued to rise in Philadelphia, Richmond, and Dallas, and rising home prices led to an increase in home equity lending in Philadelphia, Chicago, and San Francisco. Chicago, Cleveland, and Atlanta noted an increase in auto lending, while credit card volumes decreased slightly in Philadelphia. Business loan demand edged higher, with several Districts noting a pick-up in both commercial and industrial and commercial real estate lending. The Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and Dallas Districts reported intense competition on pricing and terms for commercial and industrial loans. In addition, contacts in Philadelphia and Chicago expressed concern about an easing of credit standards on these loans. Overall, however, lending standards were largely unchanged and credit quality continued to improve moderately. Agriculture and Natural ResourcesHeavy rains hurt agriculture in the Richmond, Atlanta, and Kansas City Districts, even resulting in declarations of some natural disaster areas. At the other extreme, some portions of the Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts experienced drought conditions, although they eased in some areas over the reporting period. Harvests were reported as behind their normal pace. Nonetheless, crop yields were higher than expected in the Chicago District and about average in the Kansas City District. Strong fruit output was noted in the Richmond, Chicago, and Minneapolis Districts. Cotton output was mixed across the South. Prices fell for corn, soybeans, wheat, hay, cotton, hogs, broilers, turkeys, and eggs, but rose for rice, citrus, grapes, milk, cattle, and dry beans. Livestock producers benefited from lower feed costs, as well as higher beef exports according to the Dallas District. San Francisco reported demand remained strong for most crop and livestock products. Natural resource extraction increased in September. Oil and natural gas activity remained at high levels in the Cleveland and Dallas Districts, was solid in the Kansas City District, and expanded in the Richmond and Minneapolis Districts. Drilling rig counts were stable in the Richmond and Kansas City Districts, although the latter reported a shift in rigs from oil drilling toward natural gas. This shift was driven in part by expectations of higher natural gas prices and lower oil prices in the future. Atlanta and Dallas noted steady demand for energy. San Francisco indicated that demand for oil products edged up, resulting in increased refinery activity. Refinery expansions continued in the Atlanta District, although the cost of transporting inputs to Gulf Coast refineries rose. Mining activity picked up in the Minneapolis District. Coal production in the Cleveland and Richmond Districts slowed, but output was higher in St. Louis and Kansas City. Prices and WagesPrice pressures remained limited in September. Most Districts reported only slight increases in commodity prices and limited ability to pass through these increases to their customers. Metal prices fell slightly in the Chicago District, but held steady in Minneapolis and were up slightly in Dallas. The Chicago, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts reported upward pressure on prices for building materials such as asphalt, brick, lumber, and concrete, with Kansas City indicating that concrete was in short supply in the Colorado areas affected by flooding. Energy prices in most Districts were steady to slightly lower than during the prior reporting period. In general, prices for final goods were little changed, except for a faster increase in retail prices in the Richmond District and higher food prices in the Kansas City and Dallas Districts. Wage pressures remained modest overall, though the Minneapolis and Richmond Districts reported moderate wage increases. Most Districts reported continued upward wage pressure for skilled workers, particularly those in consulting, accounting, information technology, engineering, and skilled manufacturing and construction trades. "We will be looking for any indication that the lead up to â€“ and start of â€“ the government shutdown impeded on business activity," Credit Suisse's Neal Soss recently wrote to clients. "Such anecdotes may push back the timing of any cutback in Fed asset purchases. At least one FOMC member, Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart, already has said that Septemberâ€™s no-taper decision 'now is vindicated by the developments' in DC," he wrote. And below you can see the full report from all the Fed's districts: Retail and TourismThe retail contacts reporting for this round cite September year-over-year comp store sales ranging from a 2 percent decrease to increases in the upper single digits. Consumer demand remains strong for apparel, home improvement items, home furnishings, and sporting goods, with online sales accounting for an increasing fraction of total sales. Inventories are said to be in good shape and prices remain steady. Contacts say that while consumer sentiment seems to have improved over the summer months through mid-September--which they attribute in part to more positive trends in the housing marketâ€“the recent decline in the stock market and federal government shutdown may damp consumer spending. Respondents note uncertainty about the underlying strength of the economic recovery. Domestic and international leisure travel and corporate business travel and entertaining are quite strong. Hotel occupancy rates in Boston and Cambridge reached a nine-year high in August, with average room rates the highest in a decade. However, if the federal government shutdown lasts more than ten days, it could curtail some leisure travel, as domestic leisure travelers seem to operate within a 10-day booking window. October is New England's busiest month of the year for travel, so such a curtailment now could be particularly significant for businesses throughout the region that rely on tourism. Manufacturing and Related ServicesOf 11 manufacturing firms contacted this cycle, only one, a frozen food producer, reports falling sales. Among firms reporting higher sales, those in the medical and technology areas with blockbuster products report double-digit sales growth, more or less independently of the state of the economy. The rest of the firms generally report year-on-year sales growth in low single digits and, for such firms, small changes are very significant. For example, a diversified firm in the building equipment and aerospace industries reports sales growth of only 3 percent when they expected 4 percent; as a result, the firm has imposed serious restrictions on hiring and, in some areas, substantial layoffs, as the firm attempts to meet earnings targets through cost containment. On the global front, China has reportedly stabilized, but several contacts mention that other emerging markets declined, pointing in particular to Brazil and India. Indeed, a contact at a manufacturer of computer storage devices describes the two countries as "disasters." Interestingly, the devaluation of the Indian currency was good for this firm's income statement because, due to outsourcing, their costs in India exceed their revenues; nonetheless, the contact views the turmoil in India as worrisome news. A firm in the semiconductor industry reports that an unusually long down-cycle in sales appears to have come to an end and that sales have returned to their historic peak, achieved in 2010. Eight of the 11 contacts say they are keeping employment steady and hiring only for replacement or for key needs. Of the remaining three, one plans to consolidate two business lines and cut headquarters staff, including some highly paid executives. The other two, a drug manufacturer and a computer storage firm, are hiring significantly and roughly in line with their sales growth. Only one contact, a firm in the semiconductor equipment business, reports revising investment plans down recently. The rest are holding steady or accelerating their plans. In particular, the firm planning layoffs is at the same time "investing for the long run," albeit mostly in Asia. The outlook ranges from fair to very good. One contact in publishing expects slow growth for at least the next 12 to 18 months. Another contact said he was, "increasingly nervous that there is another little slowdown here." But many other contacts are quite optimistic, including a firm that had disappointing results in 2013, where the contact expects 2014 to be better. Selected Business ServicesConsulting and advertising contacts report a strong third quarter, consistent with a sustainably, but not rapidly, growing economy. Healthcare consultants cite the strongest results, as the double-digit revenue growth of the past few years continues. Demand for healthcare consulting services is driven by increased merger and acquisition activity among providers, adoption of new technology, compliance with new regulations, and the need for organizational change due to structural shifts in the healthcare industry. Demand for economic consulting remains strong, and strategy consultants report that "the economy is slowly picking up steam." Marketing contacts estimate industry-wide growth of 6 percent to 7 percent, driven by large corporate orders and a shift in demand towards higher-value items as companies have more to spend on marketing and branding. By contrast, a government consultant reports a slight drop in revenues and a smaller backlog as the sequester continues to reduce agencies' ability to purchase services. Most firms' annual salary adjustments range from 2 percent to 4 percent. A majority of contacts report minimal increases in health insurance costs; however, two cite troublingly large increases. Firms' own rate increases are about 3 percent to 5 percent. Economic and healthcare consulting firms have been increasing employment 10 percent to 15 percent on an annual basis, strategy consultants closer to 5 percent, while marketing and government consultants report little to no hiring. Contacts expect growth to continue at or moderately above its current level as long as the economy is not hit with a shock. Other than the government contractor, contacts are not worried about the sequester or European uncertainty, and several note that European risk has been "priced in" or forgotten about. Several are very concerned, however, about the potential for a debt ceiling-induced financial crisis. Commercial Real EstateReports from First District contacts describe the region's commercial real estate markets as either stable or strengthening. A Boston contact cites improvement in leasing fundamentals in recent weeks across diverse sectors--including office and assisted living facilities--while investment sales demand is up from an already-strong pace. Redevelopment activity picked up in Boston's retail sector, with plans for filling and retooling vacant space in both urban and suburban locations. Another Boston contact says office leasing activity is roughly unchanged since the last report, with strong demand in the Seaport and Kendall Square areas and comparatively weak demand for locations in the Financial District. Build-to-suit office construction continues in prime neighborhoods but otherwise office construction is negligible in metro Boston. A Portland contact notes significant improvements in leasing fundamentals and investment demand in recent months. In Hartford, the sale of two large office building in recent months has resulted in a significant decline in the office vacancy rate for class A space, from upwards of 25 percent to roughly 17 percent, a decline that should lead to some firming of rents after a long period of stagnation. Also in Hartford, investor demand for prime office and multifamily properties stayed strong. A Providence contact is mostly upbeat, citing a modest uptick in leasing activity in recent weeks and some positive absorption of downtown office space. While leasing volume increased across the region, contacts note that most leasing deals consist of renewals-in-place or relocations of existing firms, with little to no net expansion of firms' footprints. In Boston, local conditions lead contacts to expect more slow-to-modest growth in the commercial real estate sector moving forward, but national economic and political conditions lend uncertainty and downside risks to the outlook. In both Rhode Island and Connecticut, contacts are cautiously optimistic that commercial leasing fundamentals will continue to improve, but note that their respective states face persistent challenges to economic growth, leaving their overall prospects weaker than the U.S. average. A Portland contact is mostly optimistic that southern Maine will continue to see modest growth in leasing fundamentals, but expects investment sales to slow with rising interest rates. Residential Real EstateResidential real estate contacts in the First District say markets continue to strengthen and they are "cautiously optimistic" about the outlook. According to a source in New Hampshire, realtors are no longer talking about returning to a "non-recession" market, but rather stating that market conditions have returned to normal. August saw sales of single-family homes and condominiums continuing to increase across the region compared to August 2012. Market participants, however, are watching interest rates closely. Where current market activity is largely driven by first time home buyers--such as in Maine and Connecticut--higher interest rates could slow sales. In other states, rising interest rates may be temporarily spurring activity as buyers attempt to lock in lower rates. With the exception of one state which saw condo prices fall, median prices for single-family homes and condominiums rose in August relative to last year. Inventory trends vary across the states, with Massachusetts seeing inventory for single-family homes and condos low compared to historic norms--making it a sellers' market--while inventory in Maine increased in August compared to a year ago and New Hampshire sources indicate there "appears to be more balance between buyers and sellers." While First District realtors say that this has been a turnaround year, they fear economic shocks could still stall the recovery. In addition, respondents express concern about negative effects on housing markets of the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012; they say that lack of affordable flood insurance may cause values to fall and buyer delays in newly redrawn flood zones. Economic growth in the Second District has continued at a moderate pace since the last report. Contacts indicate some increase in cost pressures, though selling prices continue to be steady to up slightly. Labor market conditions have shown further signs of improvement, and there are scattered reports of wage pressures. General merchandise retailers indicate that sales were generally steady in September and close to plan, while new auto sales have been increasingly robust. Tourism activity has shown some signs of picking up since the last report. Commercial and especially residential real estate markets have shown signs of firming. In contrast, contacts in the manufacturing sector report a pause in growth, and the climate in the financial sector is described as downbeat. Bankers report softer loan demand from the household sector, no change in credit standards, little change in loan spreads, and continued widespread declines in delinquency rates. More broadly, some contacts express concern about potential disruptive effects of a prolonged federal government shutdown. Consumer SpendingRetailers report that sales have been generally steady and close to plan since the last report. A major retail chain reports that sales were on plan in both August and September, with New York City stores continuing to out-perform the rest of the region. One major mall in upstate New York notes that sales picked up somewhat in September whereas another upstate mall indicates that sales have been steady and roughly on par with 2012 levels. Inventories are generally characterized as on plan. Prices are generally described as somewhat more promotional than a year ago.Â  Buffalo area auto dealers report that new vehicle sales were steady and strong in August, running 13 percent ahead of a year ago, while Rochester-area dealers report that sales accelerated and were up more than 20 percent. While final numbers are not yet tallied, sales are reported to have remained robust in September. Sales of used automobiles have generally been soft. Wholesale and retail credit conditions for auto purchases continue to be characterized as favorable. Tourism activity has shown increasing strength since the last report. Manhattan hotels report that revenues were up 5-6 percent from a year earlier in September, following gains of 3-4 percent in both July and August. Occupancy rates remain above 90 percent--up nearly 2 percentage points from comparable 2012 levels--while room rates are up roughly 3 percent. Based on bookings, October looks to be strong as well. Attendance at Broadway theaters picked up noticeably in August and especially in September. After running below 2012 levels for most of this year, attendance was up 5-6 percent from a year ago in September, and total revenues were up 10 percent--in part reflecting some new shows opening.Â  Finally, consumer confidence in the region has improved since the last report. The Conference Board's survey of residents of the Middle Atlantic states (NY, NJ, Pa) shows confidence surging to a nearly six year high in September, while Siena College's survey of New York State residents points to a more moderate increase. Construction and Real EstateResidential real estate markets in the District have been steady to stronger since the last report. Buffalo-area contacts continue to describe market conditions as robust in both August and September, with brisk sales volume, moderately rising prices, and continued reports of bidding wars. Sales activity in New York City's co-op and condo market was exceptionally brisk in the third quarter--the highest since 2007 and the 2nd highest in 24 years. Sales of smaller (one bedroom) apartments were particularly strong. The inventory of available apartments for sale has fallen to new lows, as completed transactions are outnumbering the flow of new listings. Â Whereas Manhattan prices have risen only modestly, prices for Brooklyn apartments are reported to be up 10-15 percent over the past year. New York City's rental market has been mixed: while Manhattan rents have stopped rising and are down slightly from a year ago, Brooklyn rents have been rising at a more than 10 percent pace. A contact in New Jersey's housing industry reports continued gradual improvement in market conditions. Prices continue to rise modestly, held back by a persistent overhang of distressed properties. The Jersey shore sales market remains tepid, with prices still well below their pre-recession peaks--particularly in areas hard hit by Sandy last October. Office markets were steady to stronger in the third quarter. Manhattan's vacancy rate declined to 7.3 percent--its lowest level in more than four years--while asking rents continued to rise, particularly on Class B properties. Long Island's office vacancy rate also edged down below 8 percent, though asking rents were little changed. Â In the northern New Jersey and Westchester/Fairfield markets, however, vacancy rates were unchanged at much higher levels, while asking rents were little changed. A New Jersey real estate contact maintains that non-residential construction activity is almost strictly limited to renovations and improvements on existing properties. Other Business ActivityOn balance, the labor market has shown further signs of improving. One major employment agency reports broad-based strength in hiring activity and notes increasing difficulty finding qualified job candidates; more job-seekers are reportedly getting multiple offers and there are now scattered reports of salaries being bid up. Another contact, however, reports more modest improvement and characterizes wage offers as stable. Both contacts report particularly strong demand for IT workers. One employment agency notes that the government shutdown has hampered efforts to do background checks on prospective employees, whereas another contact indicates this has not been problematic thus far.Â  A contact in the finance sector characterizes the current business climate as gloomy--hiring has reportedly been mixed, with much of the demand focused on people in legal and compliance fields. Manufacturing firms in the District report some slowing in hiring activity, along with a pause in growth more generally; these contacts are also less optimistic about the near-term outlook. However, non-manufacturing firms generally indicate that both business and hiring activity have increased modestly since the last report, though these contacts have also become a bit less optimistic about the near term outlook and also in their net hiring plans. Both manufacturers and other firms report some pickup in input price pressures but little change in their selling prices. Financial DevelopmentsBankers reported weakening demand for consumer loans and especially in residential mortgages but increased demand for commercial mortgages. Demand for mortgage refinancing also continued to decrease. Respondents reported no change in demand for commercial &amp; industrial loans. Credit standards were unchanged across all loan categories. Respondents indicated a narrowing in spreads of loan rates over costs of funds for commercial loans and mortgages but no change in spreads for consumer loans and residential mortgages. Finally, bankers report further widespread declines in delinquency rates for all loan categories. Despite a slower pace of growth in some sectors, contacts overall maintained an outlook for moderate growth--similar to the last Beige Book. The housing recovery has softened somewhat for existing home sellers and new homebuilders, and builders are less optimistic. However, contacts in other sectors continued to express confidence in the underlying economy. In particular, manufacturers and service-sector firms expressed greater confidence in the U.S. economy and in global conditions. In regard to hiring and capital expenditure plans, firms continued to expand cautiously, as they face ongoing uncertainty from the federal government shutdown and implementation of the Affordable Care Act. ManufacturingOverall, Third District manufacturers have reported a significant rebound in orders and shipments for a modest pace of growth since the last Beige Book. Over one-third of firms reported growth. Producers in nearly all sectors of durable and nondurable goods reported stronger activity. The chemicals and allied products industry was a notable exception. Overall, firms continued to report strong demand from auto- and residential construction-related businesses. Numerous firms reported growing demand for exports to Europe, China, and/or South America. However, one large industrial supplier reported continued growth through August, then softening in September. Optimism that business conditions will improve over the next six months has broadened among Third District manufacturers. Contacts expect foreign and domestic demand to increase. Consequently, expectations of hiring and capital spending plans have largely rebounded since the last Beige Book, including more talk of "reshoring" of production that had gone overseas. However, several firms expect to deploy more capital than labor to meet higher production levels. The federal government shutdown has reignited concerns about fiscal drag, which is of most concern to smaller firms. Otherwise, the U.S. economy is still "poised to grow." RetailThird District retailers have continued to report modest growth overall since the last Beige Book. Sales in August were generally stronger than in July, especially at outlet malls; sales at traditional mall retailers softened somewhat in the second half of August and then ticked up in early September after most schools had resumed. Convenience store retailers reported similar results but noted softness in discretionary purchases and a reliance on promotions and discounting. Hiring plans reported by area retailers for the 2013 holiday season were generally equal to or greater than last year's--reflecting similar expectations for sales. Some retailers plan to add seasonal workers earlier in what appears to be an effort to extend the shopping season, since the traditional holiday period will be six days shorter than in 2012. The optimistic sales expectations generally assume that the federal government shutdown does not extend beyond two weeks. Auto dealers reported that August was a "killer" month; however, year-over-year comparisons were boosted by stealing an extra Saturday from September compared with last year. September sales were reported as still very strong, although the lost weekend may account for a little dip from August's pace. In addition, sales slowed for some dealers as they grew low on inventory. Dealers continued to report good prospects for future sales.Â  FinanceOverall, Third District financial firms continued to report modest increases in total loan volume. The most notable difference from the last Beige Book period was a slight drop in commercial real estate loan volumes. Contacts noted that demand for mortgages to purchase homes continued to increase modestly, as did demand for home equity lines and C&amp;I loans. Stronger increases were noted for most types of consumer lending, although volumes for credit cards fell off slightly. Some bankers indicated that home equity lines were being used to pay off remaining low mortgage balances. However, with the rise in interest rates, a mortgage servicing company indicated that prepayments were starting to slow. While some contacts reported growth of activity from medium-sized companies, most continued to report that small businesses remain very cautious. Many banking contacts expressed concerns about aggressive competition on rates and terms, suggesting that credit standards may have eased a little. Overall, most bankers remained optimistic, although they expressed uncertainty on behalf of their business customers and for themselves over the implications of both the Affordable Care Act and a prolonged government shutdown. Real Estate and ConstructionThird District homebuilders reported mixed results in August â€“ from weak demand to "finished strong." However, by the end of September, most builders reported that traffic was down and that very few contracts for new construction had closed. Builders assigned only partial blame to rising interest rates, stressing as well that the pool of potential buyers has been culled by weakened consumer confidence. The recent slowdown has caused builders to adjust their outlook lower. General residential construction activity continues to grow slightly from prior sales. Also, other contacts reported strong demand for home renovations. A final tally of existing home sales also indicated a slower year-over-year pace of growth in August than in July, according to many residential brokers. Sales closed and sales pending barely hit double-digit percent increases (year over year) in a few of the Third District's larger metropolitan areas; the metrics were worse in other areas. Homes sold were nearly flat in the Harrisburg area and fell in the Lehigh Valley. Sales pending grew a mere 2 percent in the Greater Philadelphia area. Although little change was indicated by nonresidential real estate contacts in the modest pace of overall leasing activity and slight growth of construction, their outlook improved overall. Architecture and engineering firms continued to see stronger interest and workflow. The resurgence of Philadelphia-area refineries continued to reignite strong construction and maintenance operations. Leasing agents, management companies, and commercial market analysts are increasingly upbeat over the steady progress in various sectors and locations within the Third District. ServicesThird District service-sector firms continued to report a moderate pace of growth overall; staffing firms and tourism maintained a more modest pace. Parts of the Jersey shore experienced lighter traffic this season. Hotel activity was on par with previous seasons; however, longer-term rentals were down, suggesting that tourists kept their visits short. A Delaware shore realtor reported slow but steady sales in August and September; however, the realtor did not see the pickup in rentals he was expecting during the summer season.Â  Other service firms continued a moderate pace of growth overall. A large IT firm reported a very strong increase in sales as "the floodgates opened over the last year." Another large service firm reported continued moderate improvement in its base business and an increase in new business from last year. A third large firm reported "not much has changed--a point or two on the softer side," but still growing and doing great. Overall, service-sector firms remained optimistic about future growth. Prices and WagesOverall, price levels continued to increase slightly, similar to the previous Beige Book. Manufacturing firms reported that prices paid and prices received moved higher again; the increases were more widespread this period than last. However, auto dealers and general retailers reported little change in pricing, and builders reported holding prices steady. Most contacts report coping with extremely tight margins. Generally, real estate contacts continued to report rising prices for lower-priced homes, while higher-priced homes are aligned to local market conditions. Some contacts reported high-cost increases for employees' health insurance coverage. However, very few contacts are seeing wage pressures, other than for a few highly skilled occupations. Fourth District--Cleveland Hiring was sluggish across industry sectors. Staffing-firm representatives reported that the number of job openings and placements increased slightly, with vacancies found primarily in healthcare and manufacturing. Wage pressures remain contained. Input and finished goods prices saw little change, apart from increases in residential construction materials. ManufacturingReports fromÂ District factories showed that demand was steady to growing at a robust pace during the past couple of months. Companies seeing the strongest activity were suppliers to the housing, motor-vehicle, and oil and gas industries. Weakness in euro-zone and Asian economies was often cited as a barrier to stronger growth. Defense contractors are still coping with uncertainty, which was attributed to the sequester. Compared to a year ago, manufacturing production levels are similar or higher. Most of our contacts are cautiously optimistic and expect little change in demand, although many were uneasy about fiscal issues and implications of the Affordable Care Act on their businesses. Steel producers and service centers reported that shipping volume is increasing, but at a very slow rate. Several respondents continue to express concern about the quantity of steel imports, especially from China. Steel producers do not expect market conditions to change appreciably in the upcoming months. District auto production recovered in August on a month-over-month basis as motor-vehicle assembly plants returned to normal production schedules. Compared to a year ago, motor-vehicle production figures revealed a sizeable increase. Only a few manufacturers reported that they are moving forward with capacity expansion plans. Other producers said that they see a need to expand capacity, but they will not proceed because of uncertainty about the economy. One manufacturer commented that he will postpone any expansion until GDP grows at a sustained rate of 3 percent. Capital outlays are being allocated primarily for productivity enhancements. Several manufacturers indicated that they are taking a more conservative stance toward upcoming capital budgets until there is a higher degree of certainty about future demand. Raw material and finished goods prices were generally flat. Factories expanded payrolls at a sluggish pace. Several contacts expect production wages will rise between 2 and 3 percent in the near term. There is anxiety about rising health insurance premiums, which was attributed to the Affordable Care Act. Real EstateSales of new single-family homes and construction starts were stable but below levels seen during the second quarter. Compared to a year ago, new home-building activity is considerably higher. Builders are uncertain about the effect of rising interest rates on potential buyers. New-home contracts were found mainly in the mid-price-point category. The first-time home-buyer category remains very weak. Builders are confident that demand for new homes will persist in the upcoming months, and they believe that some loosening in credit markets would provide a boost to their industry. Selling prices of new homes are rising across the District. Two builders told us that they were able to push through increases during August to offset rising labor and material costs. Nonresidential builders reported an overall pick-up in business, but it remains difficult to move projects from the pipeline to a contract signing due to uncertainty on the part of clients. Very large projects are few in number, and renovations are more prevalent than new building in some regions of the District. In general, business is stronger than a year ago. Inquiries and backlogs have strengthened since our last report. The strongest activity was in manufacturing, distribution, healthcare, and multifamily housing. A developer of retail space characterized his industry as strong and much more positive than two years ago. He noted a decline in regional mall footprints due to chain consolidation and on-line shopping. Our contacts were fairly optimistic about near-term growth prospects, but they are concerned about unresolved fiscal policy issues. Prices for residential construction materials--lumber and drywall--have increased substantially in the past year, but the rate of increase is slowing. General contractors reported very limited hiring of field and office workers. Many builders cited a scarcity of high-skilled trade workers, many of whom left the industry during the recession and are not returning. As a result, there is upward pressure on wages, and subcontractors are demanding higher rates. Subcontractors are also having difficulty obtaining operating capital. Consumer SpendingMost retailers we spoke with reported that same-store sales were stronger in August and September than they had been during the previous four months and were above year-ago levels. They cited an improving labor market and new product introductions as reasons for the increase. Products in greater demand included back-to-school items, home furnishings, and cold-weather apparel. A food retailer attributed her chain's margin growth to consumers trading up in their buying habits. Fourth-quarter sales are expected to improve slightly when compared to those in the third quarter. Inventories were described as being in good shape. Retailers were able to clear out their left-over summer merchandise. Vendor and shelf prices held steady, and agricultural prices stabilized. Some of our contacts expect to increase capital spending in 2014, mainly for improving e-commerce and distribution systems. Hiring will be limited to staffing new stores. Temporary hiring for the upcoming holiday shopping season is expected to be modestly higher than a year ago. Year-to-date sales through August of new motor vehicles showed a moderate increase when compared to the same time period a year ago. On a month-over-month basis, purchases of new vehicles were only slightly higher during August versus July. Buyers continue to prefer smaller, fuel-efficient vehicles, although trucks are in big demand in regions with considerable shale-gas activity. New-vehicle inventories are lower than desired, which dealers attributed to the model-year changeover. Our contacts are optimistic about sales for the remainder of the year. They project that sales volume for 2013 will be about 10 percent higher than in 2012 due to pent-up demand, the availability of financing, and the option to lease. Used-vehicle purchases increased during the past six weeks. Employment levels at dealerships held steady. Many of our contacts are concerned about the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and the effect it will have on their total labor cost. BankingBankers reported that the low-interest-rate environment continues to hurt their revenues, though net interest margins are in line with expectations. Little change is anticipated in the near term. Demand for business credit was largely unchanged during the past six weeks. No loan category or industry is performing significantly better than others, although several bankers noted that commercial real estate lending has picked up. Competition for quality loans was described as aggressive.Â Consumer-credit demand showed a slight improvement, especially for auto loans and credit cards. Most bankers reported a slowdown in residential mortgage activity, mainly on the refinancing side. A slight rise in interest rates had little effect on new- purchase applications. For the most part, delinquency rates declined slightly across categories. On balance, banking payrolls were flat. We heard a couple of reports about layoffs due to branch-office downsizing or closures. Some wage pressure was reported, especially for employees working in regulation. EnergyDistrict coal production remains below year-ago levels; however, the rate of decline is shrinking. Going forward, producers project little change in production, but they are uneasy about the effects of the regulatory environment. Spot prices for steam coal declined, whereas metallurgical coal prices were flat. Oil and gas drilling held steady during the past six weeks. Output from shale-gas wells in Pennsylvania during the first half of 2013 was at a historic high. Well-head prices for natural gas are flat to down. One contact reported that, due to low natural gas prices and regulatory uncertainty at the federal, state, and local levels, the shale-gas industry will grow very slowly through the end of 2014, and the build-out of the transport and processing infrastructure will take longer to complete than originally estimated. Capital outlays are at targeted levels, and little change was seen in production-equipment and material costs. One coal company reported a workforce reduction; otherwise, payrolls held steady. Freight TransportationFreight executives reported that the rate of growth in shipping volume has slowed recently. However, year-to-date volume is higher when compared to the same period in 2012. Demand from motor-vehicle, shale-gas, and housing industries was strong. The industry outlook is favorable, with volume growing at a slow, but steady pace. Freight haulers are still uncertain about the impact of newly enacted hours-of-service regulations, especially on labor costs. Other operating costs were fairly stable. A few contacts noted that they have successfully negotiated rate increases. Some respondents plan to reduce capital outlays during the next fiscal year because substantial monies have already been allocated for capacity expansion or because equipment costs are high. The industry has been actively hiring for replacement and adding capacity. ManufacturingManufacturing generally weakened since our last report. Shipments dropped for most products, and manufacturers said that both military and civilian orders were down. Although manufacturers of metals, pulp, paper, and chemicals indicated an increase in shipments in recent weeks, their new orders softened. However, a machinery manufacturer expected orders to increase because conditions were improving and distributors had kept inventories lean. A manufacturer of milled wood products reported that he currently has sufficient supply, but many lumber harvesting companies have gone out of business, which could lead to shortages when demand picks up. Auto parts manufacturing remained strong, and an aircraft executive remarked that orders for civilian planes were up. According to our latest manufacturing survey, the pace of price increases picked up for raw materials and finished goods. PortsPort activity remained strong in recent weeks. Port officials expect that even after the seasonal increase winds down, import levels will remain above last year. Food and beverage imports increased, while exports of automotive parts were particularly strong. Forest product exports also increased, as Chinese import constraints were partially lifted. The volume of containerized grain exports was robust in recent weeks. Heavy equipment imports and exports slowed as some U.S. coal mines closed and Chinese purchases slowed. However a port contact cautioned that comparisons to a year ago appeared weaker than usual because of last year's substantial replenishment of some equipment. RetailMerchants reported flat to modestly improved sales revenues in recent weeks. An executive with a chain of hardware stores remarked that sales were flat since our last report, although year-over-year same-store sales had increased. Home and garden retailers, as well as suppliers of building materials reported stronger sales, and a manager at a sporting goods store commented that his revenues were up despite rising freight costs. Auto sales were strong at a dealership near the Washington, D.C. beltway, although other dealers in Maryland and Virginia indicated sales were flat. Many smaller retailers have limited weekly hours per employee to control healthcare costs. As a result, some employees are taking second jobs, and a few firms are even partnering to help their employees "stitch together" full time hours by working for both businesses. Average retail prices rose more quickly in recent weeks. ServicesRevenues at non-retail services firms were mixed since our last report. Demand for trucking services softened slightly in recent weeks, according to a national freight carrier. Another contact reported that loads have become heavier and there is a shift to rail transportation. Healthcare systems executives reported little change in demand, while cost reduction has continued. An executive at a West Virginia bookkeeping firm said his business was steady, while a Maryland firm that provides medical records systems said that revenues picked up. In addition, large construction companies in Maryland and Washington, D.C. reported an increase in revenues. Services price increases quickened. Tourist bookings slowed from recent strong growth. Although the federal government shutdown closed some tourist attractions, those closures did not result in guest cancellations, according to several hotel contacts. Bookings were flat for a hotel on the Maryland side of the Chesapeake Bay, and a central North Carolina hotel reported unusually slow bookings. A hotel manager in the Tidewater, Virginia area reported that summer finished on a strong note, but the autumn market of government and association bookings was below normal. A tourism contact on the outer banks of North Carolina told us that hotel bookings and rentals were stable, with family stays during Thanksgiving becoming increasingly popular. A resort manager in western Virginia has already received a few early season ski reservations. An hotelier in the North Carolina Piedmont expected a strong October for leaf viewing and a sold-out holiday season. FinanceConsumer lending increased slightly. New residential mortgage lending increased according to a lender in West Virginia, who said that more people were taking long-term fixed rate mortgages rather than one to five year ARM's. He added that he has a decent pipeline for several months ahead and rates were stable. A North Carolina lender reported that loan demand was stable although pricing, especially for jumbo loans, was very competitive. He commented that some lenders were willing to sacrifice a good bit of margin to get those loans and another banker described the environment as "pretty brutal." In contrast, a lender in Virginia noted much slower demand for loans and mortgages. A Northern Virginia banker commented, "Banks are chasing the good deals," and therefore, spreads remained low. Inside the Washington beltway, demand for commercial real estate lending was strong, particularly for hotels and apartment buildings. A central Virginia banker also reported that lending for multi-family housing and commercial refinancing remained solid. A lender in North Carolina said while real estate loans slowed, demand for other commercial loans rose modestly, particularly in metro areas. Competition for commercial and industrial lending was strong. Lenders generally reported no changes in standards and credit quality. Real EstateResidential real estate markets improved, although new construction was limited. Residential sales increased according to a Realtor in the Washington, D.C. area. He noted that days on the market remained low despite reduced foot traffic, and sales in most price ranges improved, with the exception of homes over $1.5 million. A central North Carolina Realtor reported that sales and prices rose, while inventory on the market declined to slightly over five months. Houses in the more affordable range were moving, while the higher-end market was slow. Another Realtor commented that the mortgage process could take four and a half months for even the best applicants. A Maryland contact noted that new restrictions were making the mortgage process more challenging. He reported fewer days on the market and a marked increase in sales of entry level homes, while inventory remained steady. According to a report from the Tidewater area of Virginia, residential real estate sales were strong. A contact in South Carolina told us sales were up, mostly for price levels below $250,000. He also stated that condo sales rose slightly, but foreclosures and short sales in that area continued to depress prices. Commercial development of multi-family housing has remained strong. A central Virginia Realtor reported that there is virtually no new speculative commercial building, and medical construction is either build to suit or with sixty to eighty percent of tenants. In contrast, smaller scale, single family residential development there picked up, and construction and renovation of apartment buildings was strong. He added that leasing activity was "reasonable" for smaller tenants; rents firmed and there were fewer incentives. Commercial leasing slowed in the D.C. area, according to a contact who told us people are "punting a little" before making decisions on five to ten year leases and construction. A central North Carolina real estate broker reported that retail leasing had improved slightly. Another Realtor in that state said last year's incentives were burning off, and leasing activity was steady. He commented that vacant office space was sufficient except for very large blocks, while industrial warehouse construction was picking up despite rising construction costs. In West Virginia, a Realtor noted that increased calls and site visits did not necessarily translate into a new purchase agreement. Agriculture and Natural ResourcesFruit and peanut yields have been excellent, while cucumber production was reduced this autumn as a result of too much rain. Cotton and soybean harvests are also expected to be low this year because of the excessive rain this summer. Natural gas production rose since our last report. A contact noted that some wells on the perimeter of production areas in West Virginia have produced more than expected, leading to speculation that the ultimate production area may be larger than originally defined. As always, further expansion will depend on prices, which declined in recent weeks. More pipeline was added, while the rig count remained static. Coal production in the District declined, with the year-to-date percentage drop in Maryland and Virginia both in double digits. West Virginia coal production also fell, although the drop was not as steep. Labor MarketsLabor markets continued their slow expansion in most areas of the District since our last report. Our most recent survey results indicated that employment in manufacturing and in the non-retail service sector grew modestly. Employers across the District reported rising turnover and challenges finding qualified workers in biotech, health care, information technology, engineering, and advanced manufacturing. Demand for low- or semi-skilled workers included truckers, retail associates, warehouse employees, machine operators, and collections agents. Many contacts also commented on reluctance to expand due to uncertainty surrounding the Affordable Care Act; some employers cut hours or employees. Remarks on effects of sequestration were mixed. Average wages in the manufacturing and service sectors increased more quickly in recent weeks. Most retailers cited slightly improved levels of spending and auto dealers continued to experience solid results. Hospitality reports remained largely positive. Residential brokers and builders continued to witness improvements in many parts of the District as sales and prices of new and existing homes increased compared with a year ago. Commercial development picked up slightly, led by multifamily construction. Manufacturers indicated that new orders and production had increased since the last report. Bankers saw increased volumes for both commercial and consumer loans. Payrolls across the region expanded, albeit at a slower pace than the previous report. Firms noted input costs remained stable. Consumer Spending and TourismDistrict retailers continued to report modest spending as consumers remained focused on finding deals. Back-to-school retailers and fast-food establishments cited that sales were slightly lower than a year ago; however, District auto dealers reported continued gains in light vehicle sales. On average, merchants indicated that sales and store traffic were slightly up for the year and are expecting this trend to carry on for the remainder of the year. The travel and tourism sector continued to cite healthy demand in leisure travel as hotel bookings, revenue per available room, and attendance at conventions and attractions all increased. Contacts confirmed a slight increase in hiring, as well as a healthy supply of qualified applicants. However, government cut backs and softening demand from Europe and China were sources of concern for many hospitality firms. Overall, the industry is anticipating the same pace of growth for the rest of the year and into the beginning of 2014 based on reports of advanced bookings. Real Estate and ConstructionOverall, District brokers indicated that existing home sales remained ahead of last year's level. In particular, home sales growth continued to improve among Florida brokers while brokers outside of Florida noticed that sales growth remained positive but slowed notably on a year-over-year basis. Brokers also noted a larger than usual seasonal slowdown in buyer traffic. By most accounts, inventory levels continued to decline on a year-over-year basis and home prices continued to rise. The outlook for sales remains slightly positive with half of brokers anticipating sales gains over the next several months. District homebuilders said that new home sales and construction were ahead of year earlier levels. However, reports indicated new home sales softened in recent months. Most builders saw modest home price appreciation since the last report. The outlook for new home sales and construction was positive, but the outlook for growth moderated from earlier in the year. District commercial brokers noted that demand for space improved at a modest pace towards the end of the summer. Construction activity was described as flat to slightly up on a year-over-year basis with apartment development dominating activity. Contractors noted that government related construction slowed while light manufacturing related construction picked up. Brokers indicated that most markets still favored tenants; however, rental rate increases continued to be noted in select submarkets. The outlook among District commercial real estate contacts remained positive with further improvements expected for the rest of the year. Manufacturing and TransportationMost District manufacturers reported that the pace of growth remained flat or rose slightly in September. New orders, production, finished inventories, commodity prices, and hiring all increased since the previous period while supply delivery times experienced a modest decrease. Auto manufacturers in particular continued to describe solid demand for their products. When asked about their outlook, one-third of regional purchasing managers expect higher production over the next three to six months. Regional trucking contacts reported recent increases in tonnage, primarily because of shipments related to housing, autos, and energy. However, truckload and less-than-truckload volumes were described as mostly flat for the year. District ports continued to cite increased activity in the movement of energy products and steel imports, along with an uptick in exports of forestry products, such as wood pellets and resins. Containerized freight growth was seen as mostly even for the year. Regional railroad firms reported significant year-to-date declines in the shipment of agricultural products and military equipment; however, substantial increases in the movement of chemicals and nonferrous scrap metals have offset those declines. Banking and FinanceBankers voiced concern over interest rate risk as they noticed that their competitors were more willing to extend credit and in some cases were aggressively seeking qualified borrowers. According to some contacts, banks seemed to be luring loan business mostly away from each other, rather than creating new opportunities. District bankers reported increased activity in owner-occupied commercial real estate, commercial and industrial, manufacturing, small business, and healthcare lending. Consumer loan volume, including purchase/construction mortgages, second mortgages, auto loans, and even credit cards, was strong in some regions. However, mortgage lending overall had slowed as interest rates increased and the refinancing boom subsided. Some contacts mentioned residential real estate lending was now about evenly split between refinancing and new mortgages. Employment and PricesSince the last report, the District's overall pace of payroll growth slowed somewhat. In July, Georgia and Florida saw payroll gains greater than the District's monthly average for the year, but August's sizeable contractions in payrolls in those states brought the pace closer to the monthly average. Louisiana saw strong gains in leisure and hospitality employment, particularly in accommodation and food services. The District's rate of unemployment remained unchanged and slightly higher than the national average. Employers continued to report hiring hesitancy related to changes in healthcare regulation and fiscal policy uncertainty. Input costs remained largely stable, according to business contacts. The few input costs that were cited as rising were doing so very slowly. According to our September Business Inflation Expectations survey, increases in unit costs remained in the range of 1.3 to 1.7 percent over the past year. Looking forward, businesses expect unit costs to rise by 1.9 percent, on average, over the next 12-months. There were few reports of pricing power and margins remained tight. Wages remained in a range that met expectations of most firms, but some noted upward wage pressures for certain high-skilled workers. Natural Resources and AgricultureEnergy refiners across the region have been in the throes of expansion as new projects and investments continue to be announced. Contacts reported that demand and inventories of oil and natural gas remained steady. Additionally, transportation of these natural resources to the Gulf Coast for refinement and processing was increasingly occurring via barges and trucks rather than pipeline and rail since those networks are under construction. Contacts indicated that this method of transportation was driving up costs. As a result of this year's excessive rain and flooding, which heavily damaged some crops, the USDA declared most counties in Alabama and many in Georgia, Florida, and Tennessee as natural disaster areas. Since the last report, average monthly prices paid to farmers for corn, cotton, soybeans, hogs, and broilers were down but were up for rice, citrus, beef, and milk. Lower corn prices benefited livestock producers that rely on corn for feed. Compared to August, cotton estimates for September indicated reduced production in Florida, Mississippi, and Tennessee; higher production in Alabama and Louisiana; and unchanged production in Georgia. Consumer SpendingConsumer spending grew modestly in September, falling short of retailersâ€™ expectations. Auto sales increased at a slower pace, but dealers noted continued strength in demand for used vehicles and in the fuel-efficient passenger car and light truck segments. Non-auto retailers reported that back-to-school spending was less than last year. However, sales of electronics and home-related items such as furniture, appliances, building materials, and gardening supplies remained stronger. Retailers expected holiday season spending to be similar to last year. Business SpendingGrowth in business spending flattened out in September. Inventories remained at comfortable levels according to most retailers and manufacturers. However, a few noted low inventories of used vehicles and at steel service centers. Growth in capital spending slowed slightly, though contacts reported an increase in productivity-enhancing investments to structures, equipment, and information technology as well as workforce training. The pace of hiring edged lower. Manufacturing contacts noted layoffs in several mining-related industries, and reported cutting back on overtime. Retailers indicated that seasonal hiring plans were about the same as last year, and a staffing agency reported a slight reduction in billable hours. In contrast, contacts continued to report plans to increase employment over the remainder of the year. Demand remained strong for skilled and experienced workers, with many such positions still difficult to fill. Several manufacturing contacts also noted difficulty in finding and retaining entry-level workers. Construction and Real EstateConstruction and real estate activity continued to increase in September. Demand for residential construction grew moderately, with single-family homebuilding increasing at a steady pace and multifamily construction softening somewhat. Many contacts worried that higher interest rates could lead builders to cut back on new development projects. Sales of new homes continued to increase as inventories remained low, although growth was not as strong as in previous months. Real estate contacts noted that increasing competition for listings among brokers had pushed commission rates lower. Nonresidential construction grew modestly, as contacts noted an improvement in the outlook for industrial building. Commercial real estate activity continued to expand, although vacancy rates, particularly in the retail sector, remained elevated. ManufacturingGrowth in manufacturing production decreased slightly in September. The auto and aerospace industries were again a source of strength for District manufacturing. Steel production and capacity utilization were steady, with an increase in domestic demand for steel primarily met by a rise in imports. Specialty metal manufacturers reported lower shipments, but remained optimistic for the fourth quarter as order books filled. Demand for heavy equipment continued to be soft, although orders picked up some. Contacts also cited an improving outlook for the industry, driven by an expected recovery in export demand and domestic construction. Manufacturers of construction materials and household appliances experienced a slight decline in demand, but remained optimistic about the recovery in the housing market. Manufacturing contacts, in general, remained cautiously optimistic for the remainder of this year and 2014, but several expressed concern about the confidence of their customers amid the federal government shutdown. Banking and FinanceCredit conditions changed little on balance over the reporting period. Financial market participants noted an increase in market volatility with heightened uncertainty surrounding recent monetary and fiscal policy actions. Banking contacts again noted competitive pressures for commercial and industrial loans, with narrowing spreads and easing standards. Some also expressed concern about the potential deterioration of underwriting standards for these loans. In addition, several contacts cited a modest increase in demand for commercial real estate lending. Consumer loan demand was steady, with a decrease in mortgage lending and an increase in auto lending. Purchase and refinance mortgage activity declined with contacts citing higher interest rates, although increasing home prices led to a modest increase in home-equity lending. Prices and CostsCost pressures changed little in September. Overall, commodity prices were down slightly. Prices for metals such as steel, copper, and aluminum edged lower. In contrast, contacts reported increases in prices for building materials such as asphalt and concrete as well as for some energy prices. Retailers again noted a slight increase in wholesale prices, although few were able to pass them along to their customers. Wage pressures remained mild, while non-wage labor costs increased. A number of contacts voiced concern about the uncertainty surrounding future employer and employee healthcare costs. In addition, several reported changing their health insurance enrollment periods this year in order to match the deadlines of the Affordable Care Act. AgricultureAlthough this yearâ€™s drought affected the harvest, corn and soybean yields in parts of the District were higher than expected in September. In fact, a contact reported that the local harvest would be the best in four years. Soybean yields were more variable than and not as favorable as corn yields. In the areas affected by drought, subsoil moisture and genetic advances in seeds reduced yield losses. Rains in September slowed harvesting, even damaging some crops that were mature. Crops harvested and sold early brought a premium due to low crop stocks prior to harvest. Since then, corn prices have dropped relatively more than soybean prices. With much of the harvest still unsold, farmers will store more of the crop in the hope of better selling opportunities over the winter. Milk and cattle prices increased from the previous reporting period, while hog prices decreased. Livestock producers continued to benefit from lower feed costs. Fruit crops bounced back strongly from last yearâ€™s devastating freeze, leading to lower prices. Economic activity in the Eighth District has grown at a moderate pace since the previous report. Recent reports of planned activity in manufacturing and services have been positive. Reports from contacts in the retail sector have also been generally positive. Residential as well as commercial and industrial real estate market conditions have continued to improve. Total lending at a sample of small and midsized District banks decreased from mid-June to mid-September. Manufacturing and Other Business ActivityReports of plans for manufacturing activity have been positive since our previous report. Several manufacturing firms reported plans to add workers, expand operations, or open new facilities in the Eighth District, while a smaller number of manufacturers reported plans to reduce employment. Firms in automobile parts, consumer products, magazine, package, tubular products, coiled metal springs, machinery, steel, chemical, specialty chemical, and plastic products manufacturing plan to hire new employees and expand operations in the Eighth District. In contrast, firms in pharmaceutical products, shoes, food, and aircraft manufacturing reported plans to lay off workers in the District. Reports of planned activity in the Districtâ€™s service sector have also been positive since the previous report. Firms in distribution, logistics, telecommunication, online shopping, wealth management, transportation, and veterinarian services reported new hiring and expansion plans. In contrast, firms in healthcare services plan to lay off employees. Reports from contacts in the retail sector have been mostly positive, as contacts noted a number of major investment projects and expansions among retail stores and restaurants. In Louisville, contacts noted that retail stores appear to be performing well and new restaurants are opening regularly; contacts also indicate higher traffic at fast food restaurants. In St.Â Louis, contacts noted high foot traffic and sales at two new outlet malls. Real Estate and ConstructionHome sales have continued to increase throughout most of the Eighth District on a year-over-year basis. Compared with the same period in 2012, August 2013 year-to-date home sales were up 17 percent in Louisville, 19 percent in Little Rock, 10 percent in Memphis, and 8 percent in St.Â Louis. August 2013 year-to-date single-family housing permits increased in the majority of the District metro areas compared with the same period in 2012. Permits increased 8.2 percent in Louisville, 21 percent in Memphis, and 17 percent in St.Â Louis, but decreased 5 percent in Little Rock. Commercial and industrial real estate market conditions have continued to improve throughout most of the District. Contacts in Little Rock reported decreased office vacancy rates and increased asking rents. A contact in St.Â Louis noted a rebound in the industrial real estate market, while a contact in Memphis reported a strengthened industrial real estate market. A contact in northwest Kentucky reported that commercial real estate activity is expected to increase by the end of 2013, while the industrial vacancy rate is expected to decline. Commercial and industrial construction activity also continued to improve throughout most of the District. A contact in central Kentucky noted increased commercial construction in Hardin County. A contact in northeast Arkansas reported that commercial development continued to be strong in northeast Jonesboro. Contacts in St.Â Louis reported plans for expansion of a manufacturing factory in southwest Missouri and industrial development in north St.Â Louis. Banking and FinanceTotal loans outstanding at a sample of small and midsized District banks decreased 1.1 percent from mid-June to mid-September. Real estate lending, which accounts for 72.9 percent of total loans, decreased 0.9 percent. Commercial and industrial loans, accounting for 15.7 percent of total loans, remained largely unchanged. Loans to individuals, accounting for 5 percent of total loans, increased 4.6 percent. All other loans, accounting for 6.4 percent of total loans, decreased 9.6 percent. During this period, total deposits at these banks remained largely unchanged. Agriculture and Natural ResourcesCrop conditions across the District remained relatively unchanged from our previous report. On average, 89 percent of the District statesâ€™ corn, cotton, sorghum, and soybean crops were rated in fair or better condition. Similarly, about 80 percent of the District statesâ€™ pastureland was rated in fair or better condition. Harvest progress in the District lagged behind the 5-year average for all five major crops. The District corn, cotton, and rice harvests were 19 percent, 14 percent, and 18 percent behind their five-year averages, respectively. The District sorghum and soybean crops fared slightly better at 9 percent and 8 percent behind their five-year averages, respectively. Year-to-date coal production in the District for August was about 3 percent higher compared with the same period in 2012. In contrast, coal production for August 2013 was about 1 percent lower than in August 2012. Consumer Spending and TourismOverall consumer spending increased since the last report. Sales and traffic at a Minneapolis area mall were level during the past two months, according to the mall manager. Recent sales were about the same as last yearâ€™s strong results at a North Dakota mall; apparel sales were soft. A Minnesota-based food producer reported that recent cereal sales increased 4 percent compared with a year earlier. A Minnesota auto dealer reported recent strong traffic and sales for new and used cars and trucks; service business was also strong. New vehicle sales were robust in North Dakota, but activity was slightly slower from exceptionally strong sales a year ago. Tourism activity was solid. Respondents to a survey of Minnesota hotels, resorts and campgrounds expect fall occupancy to be somewhat better than in 2012. Tourism businesses in Montana noted strong occupancy levels at hotels and motels and solid activity at tourism destinations through the end of the summer season. Convention business and leisure travel was very good during the past two months in the Sioux Falls, S.D., area, according to an official. However, some South Dakota hotels noted that fall reservations by hunters decreased due to a report that the number of pheasants in the state was down. Tourism destinations funded by the federal government were recently closed due to the partial government shutdown. Construction and Real EstateCommercial construction activity continued to grow since the last report. The value of September commercial building permits in Billings, Mont., increased significantly from last year. In Sioux Falls, the value of September commercial permits increased from a year ago. Several commercial building projects were announced in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area since the last report. Robust growth was noted in residential construction, especially for multifamily housing. Several multifamily building projects were announced since the last report. A long-time developer of apartment buildings warned that â€œmassiveâ€ amounts of construction could be a sign of overbuilding. In the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, the value of residential permits in September was up by 47 percent from September of 2012. However, the value of September residential building permits in Sioux Falls and Billings fell from 2012. Activity in commercial real estate markets increased since the last report. Contacts noted that several commercial real estate transactions occurred since the last report, including sales and leasing activity at higher rents. A real estate analytical firm reported that retail vacancy rates edged downward in the Minneapolis market in the third quarter. A contact from a hotel chain noted increased occupancy and rates for properties in the Ninth District. Residential real estate markets experienced moderate growth since the last report. August home sales were up 7 percent from the same period a year ago in Minnesota; the inventory of homes for sale increased by 4 percent, and median sale prices rose 14 percent. However, in the Sioux Falls area, September home sales were down 4 percent, inventory was down 5 percent and the median sale price increased 3 percent relative to a year earlier. In La Crosse, Wis., September home sales and the median price declined from September 2012. ServicesRecent activity at professional business services firms grew since the last report. A web design firm noted strong demand, but growth was limited by the lack of available talent. A package design firm noted a recent uptick in activity. Architect contacts noted a slight increase in bidding activity. Mortgage and real estate title company contacts reported a continued decrease in refinance activity. ManufacturingDistrict manufacturing activity continued to grow moderately. A September survey of purchasing managers by Creighton University (Omaha, Neb.) indicated that manufacturing activity increased in Minnesota and the Dakotas. An aerospace manufacturer announced a $34 million expansion of a plant in Montana. A producer of landscaping equipment announced plans to expand a Minnesota facility. Energy and MiningThe energy sector continued to grow. Late-September oil and gas exploration activity increased in North Dakota and was flat in Montana from a month earlier; production remained at record levels. Several highway expansion projects were under way in western North Dakota to accommodate oilfield traffic. Meanwhile, mining activity increased. Production at District iron ore mines picked up from its lull earlier in the year, but remained slightly below year-earlier levels. A stalled copper-nickel mining development in Michiganâ€™s Upper Peninsula resumed construction after it was sold to another owner. Work began on a Montana plant that will reprocess mining waste for construction and industrial use. AgricultureAgricultural conditions deteriorated somewhat since the last report. Drought conditions returned to the eastern part of the District in late summer, with parts of eastern North Dakota and central Minnesota seeing severe drought conditions in early September. Crop progress remains behind average due to late spring planting, and yields are likely to be affected. While much of the District corn and soybean crops remain in good or excellent condition, overall quality has fallen in recent weeks. However, in Minnesota, apple growers are expecting a strong harvest. Prices received by farmers in September increased from a year earlier for hogs, cattle, milk, dry beans and chickens; prices for corn, wheat, soybeans, hay, eggs and turkeys fell from a year earlier. Employment, Wages, and PricesLabor markets tightened modestly since the last report. Minnesota initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits decreased 12 percent in August compared with a year earlier. A web-based image publishing company recently broke ground on a facility in Minnesota that will add at least 300 jobs to the area. A Minnesota manufacturing company expansion will add 50 new positions at its headquarters. Contacts from Minnesota staffing agencies noted increased demand for workers and fewer workers applying for jobs. However, a bank recently eliminated about 330 jobs in Minnesota due to slowing demand for home-mortgage financing, and a Minnesota advertising company recently laid off more than 30 workers in the state. A Minnesota-based retailer announced that it is planning to hire fewer temporary workers during the holiday season than last year. Wage increases were moderate. According to a recent St. Cloud (Minn.) Area Quarterly Business Report, 43 percent of respondents expect to increase compensation over the next six months, while 56 percent expect no change. In last yearâ€™s survey, 41 percent expected to increase compensation, while 58 percent expected no change. Price increases were modest. Most metals prices were relatively level since the last report. Minnesota gasoline prices at the end of September were down about 20 cents per gallon from the end of August and almost 40 cents per gallon from a year earlier. Consumer SpendingConsumer spending slowed somewhat in September as a decline in automobile, restaurant and tourism sales was offset in part by an increase in retail activity. Retail sales picked up since the last survey, with appliance and lower-priced retail purchases particularly strong. District retailers continued to expect higher sales moving into the holiday shopping season. Automobile sales declined in September, but were in line with expectations and remained above year-ago levels. Small SUVs, cars and trucks sold well, while large SUV sales were weak. Automobile dealers expected stable sales in the coming months. Despite a slight decline in restaurant sales in September, restaurant sales remained significantly higher than year-ago levels, and respondents were more optimistic about the next few months compared to the last survey. Hotel occupancy rates fell and tourism counts declined due in part to seasonal factors. A couple of Colorado contacts also noted a decrease in restaurant sales and tourism activity due to severe effects from the recent flooding. Both occupancy rates and tourism were expected to continue to decline over the next three months.Â  Manufacturing and Other Business ActivityManufacturing activity rose modestly in September, while sales at high-tech service firms experienced strong growth and transportation activity edged up. Durable manufacturing production, shipments and new orders increased moderately since the last survey, while non-durable goods manufacturing activity decreased marginally in September. Activity in the manufacturing sector remained well above year-ago levels, and manufacturersâ€™ expectations for future activity improved substantially. Contacts expected strong growth for production, new orders and shipments over the next six months. Capital spending in the manufacturing sector was higher than a year ago and was expected to increase further in the months ahead. Sales at high-tech firms picked up in September after falling slightly during the previous survey period. High-tech services contacts also expected sales and capital spending to increase solidly in the months ahead. Transportation firms reported a modest rise in activity but did not expect additional gains in the coming months. Â  Real Estate and ConstructionResidential and commercial real estate activity remained strong in September. District residential real estate sales increased moderately and remained much higher than a year ago. Low to mid-priced homes continued to sell well, while higher priced home sales remained sluggish. The pace of home sales was projected to tick down over the next few months. Inventory levels held steady at low levels and were constraining sales in some areas. Residential home prices continued to rise across the District, and additional price gains were expected over the next few months as supported by lower anticipated inventories. Builders reported a modest gain in home starts, and construction supply firms expected stronger sales in the coming months. Residential mortgage lenders noted that higher interest rates had led to fewer refinances. Furthermore, they reported that increased regulation had added costs and tightened lending conditions. Commercial real estate construction rose, and commercial vacancy rates declined further. Commercial real estate sales were expected to pick up, and rents were expected to rise over the next three months.Â  BankingIn the recent survey period, bankers reported stronger overall loan demand, improved loan quality, and stable deposit levels. Respondents reported increased demand for commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate loans, steady demand for consumer installment loans, and decreased demand for residential real estate loans. Many bankers reported improved loan quality compared to a year ago, and nearly all bankers expected the outlook for loan quality to either improve or remain the same over the next six months. Credit standards remained unchanged in all major loan categories, and respondents reported stable deposits.Â  AgricultureIn the agriculture sector, crop production expectations were little changed from the previous survey period, but falling prices lowered farm income expectations. With most of the corn and soybean crops still in relatively good condition, overall District yields were expected to be about average. As harvest began, however, a greater probability of near-record corn and soybean production nationally led to a drop in prices, cutting farm income expectations. Meanwhile, heavy rainfall in Colorado and flooding along the South Platte River affected some agricultural lowlands. Scattered storms slowed harvest activity and winter wheat planting, but helped soil moisture conditions. Lower feed prices narrowed losses for cattle feedlot operators and improved profitability for hog producers. Weaker farm income prospects were expected to curtail farm household and capital spending, but demand for quality farmland remained strong. EnergyDistrict energy activity remained solid in September, and expectations for the coming months improved slightly. Natural gas drilling rigs for the District increased modestly in September, particularly in Colorado and Oklahoma, as gas prices remained stable. District oil drilling rigs edged down over the past month, with most of the decrease occurring in Oklahoma. Respondents expected drilling to remain stable through the end of the year as capital spending increases shift to midstream business such as pipelines. Higher oil prices continue to make oil drilling more attractive than natural gas exploration. Looking forward, however, respondents expected oil prices to drop and natural gas prices to rise in the coming months. Wyomingâ€™s coal production continued a moderate expansion from the summer months, but remained below year-ago levels. Wages and PricesWage pressures eased slightly in September, while prices rose moderately for raw materials and held steady for most finished goods. Labor shortages declined over the past month in most sectors, and most contacts reported little wage pressure outside specific skilled positions including technicians, software developers, truck drivers, and engineers. Retailers reported a small decline in prices and expected only modest price gains in the months ahead. Restaurant contacts continued to report rising food costs, but held menu prices flat. Average hotel room rates declined as occupancy rates also fell. After an acceleration in the pace of raw materials price increases in August, manufacturers reported a slight moderation in the pace of price increases in September. Manufacturers raised finished goods prices modestly, and most contacts expected additional price increases in the months ahead. Transportation firms held prices steady despite higher input costs. Builders reported little input cost pressures except for items experiencing a shortage. One example noted was a shortage of concrete and equipment in flooded Colorado areas. Commercial real estate prices and rents were flat over the past month but remained higher than year-ago levels. Residential home prices continued to rise, and additional gains were expected in the months ahead. PricesContacts said prices were stable or up over the reporting period. Manufacturers reported flat prices with the exception of increases in cement, brick, and paper. Contacts noted no change in retail or automobile prices since the last report. Accounting and legal firms noted modest increases in billing rates, and shipping rates increased in light of higher fuel costs. Airlines reported mostly flat ticket prices but higher fees. Home prices rose notably, and several real estate contacts noted strong growth in office and apartment rents. There were some reports of increased input costs, particularly for steel, rubber, beef, and dairy products. Changes in energy prices were mixed; natural gas prices held steady while the price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil fell slightly over the reporting period. Gasoline and diesel prices declined modestly from six weeks ago. Labor MarketEmployment levels held steady or increased slightly at most responding firms. Scattered reports of hiring came from staffing services, high-tech firms, fabricated metals and food manufacturers. Retail hiring was generally limited to new stores, and headcounts rose at law firms as fall associates came on board. Reports of labor shortages eased somewhat from earlier in the year, although construction firms cited difficulty finding subcontractors, and some respondents noted a competitive job market for accountants and financial analysts. Reports of pay increases were more widespread than in prior periods. Accounting firms noted strong increases in wages and bonuses. A retail contact reported upward wage pressure for IT workers, and wages rose in fabricated metals and construction-related manufacturing. Legal and finance firms said raises will be modest but above what was given last year. ManufacturingMost responding firms noted an increase in manufacturing activity over the reporting period. Construction-related manufacturers said demand was flat or up, and a brick contact noted a sharp rise in residential projects. Fabricated metals demand continued to rise, supported by the energy sector and road construction, while demand for primary metals softened slightly but remained at or above year-ago levels. Demand increased for paper and food producers. High-tech manufacturers said orders were flat to slightly up, and one semiconductor firm noted demand increased for three consecutive quarters for the first time since 2010. Respondents expect mild growth to continue over the next three to six months. Some transportation manufacturing contacts reported sizable increases in demand. An automobile manufacturer said a pickup in construction prompted a rise in demand for light trucks, and that orders exceeded production capacity. Contacts expect 2013 to be on par with 2012 or slightly stronger.Â  Petrochemical producers noted decreased production in August, although year-to-date production was slightly above what it was during the same period last year. Increased oil prices provided further support to the cost advantage of domestic petrochemical firms, but softening global demand and unplanned outages suppressed exports. Retail SalesRespondents reported that retail sales were up slightly over the reporting period, and year-over-year demand was up in the low to middle single digits. Two national firms reported that retail activity in Texas continued to marginally outperform activity in the nation. Contactsâ€™ outlooks for the next six to twelve months are cautiously positive. Automobile sales held fairly steady overall. Demand was up year over year but not as much as expected, possibly due to a lack of confidence among buyers. Inventories were in line with respondentsâ€™ expectations. Contacts have positive outlooks for the fourth quarter and into 2014. Nonfinancial ServicesNonfinancial services contacts reported mixed demand. Staffing services firms noted flat demand overall since the last report but saw an unexpected decline in direct hires. One contact saw a few signed contracts designed to circumvent the Affordable Care Act (ACA) by utilizing a temporary employee full time, then hiring that person on a permanent but part-time basis when the ACA goes into effect. Accounting firms noted demand was up seasonally due to upcoming tax deadlines, and also up modestly year over year. Contacts expect the strong demand to continue, with a further pickup in transactions work. Legal firms reported a modest decrease in demand. Litigation and corporate transactions work remained slow, and demand fell for healthcare and land use legal services. Intellectual property litigation increased and real estate work remained elevated, although it abated recently. The outlook for legal services is guarded and lawyers are less bullish than in prior periods. Transportation service firms said container and cargo volumes increased over the reporting period, except for air cargo, which held steady. Loaded container volume was up in August and up year to date compared with the same period in 2012. Strength was reported in retail imports in advance of the holiday season, and the growth was stronger than last year. Small parcel cargo volume grew at an accelerating pace in August, with growth driven by e-commerce. Air cargo volume was largely unchanged over the reporting period, both domestically and internationally, and was down slightly on a year-to-date basis when compared with last year. Contacts noted a continued trend toward cargo being carried less by passenger aircraft and more by cargo airlines. Airline contacts noted a seasonal decline in passenger demand over the past six weeks, although demand was slightly stronger than year-ago levels. Travel to Latin America and Europe was robust while travel to Asia was weak. Firms expect the fourth quarter to compare favorably to the fourth quarter of last year, and one contact is optimistic that 2014 will be stronger than 2013. Construction and Real EstateThe District housing sector remained strong over the reporting period. Respondents said most major Texas markets continued to record robust sales, while demand slowed in some parts of the U.S. Home prices continued to rise, due in part to low inventories of existing homes and finished lots. Contacts expect the pace of price increases to moderate slightly when new home construction catches up to demand. The summerâ€™s rise in mortgage rates had little effect on demand and reduced affordability only slightly, according to respondents. Contacts expect steady demand through the rest of the year and anticipate construction levels in 2014 will pick up further. Healthy apartment demand pushed occupancy rates higher despite high levels of multifamily construction activity. Increases in rents were strong in several major metros, and contacts are optimistic in their outlooks for 2014. Office and industrial leasing activity strengthened, especially in Dallas and Houston, and contacts noted strong growth in rents for class A office space. Several respondents noted a pickup in investment sales for office and industrial buildings. Outlooks for Texas commercial real estate remained optimistic. Financial ServicesLoan demand remained soft and was flat to up modestly from six weeks ago. Demand for mortgages was robust, although increased mortgage rates lowered demand from exceptionally high levels and led to less mortgage refinancing. Loan quality was good and continued to improve modestly. Financial institutions were able to sell real estate owned properties for gains. Loan pricing remained extremely competitive, with big banks undercutting community banks, especially in Austin. Deposit volumes and rates did not change, but there was some competition in rates for certificates of deposit. Outlooks are cautiously optimistic, with mortgage lending expected to remain strong and small business lending expected to increase. EnergyRespondents said that energy activity was little changed at high levels over the reporting period. Activity was better than a year ago, but margins for oil and gas services firms have tightened. Global demand held steady. Oil and gas extraction firms continued to expect modest improvement through the end of 2013 and into 2014. AgricultureThe District remained largely in drought, although the severity lessened in late September in Texas due to good rainfall and the excessive heat tapering off. The harvest progressed normally for row crops, and conditions were mostly fair to good. Improved moisture conditions increased optimism for the winter wheat crop. Beef exports increased over the reporting period. Prices and WagesPrice pressures were tame for most final goods and services. While wheat prices have increased, contacts in the agricultural and restaurant industries mentioned softening prices of some other commodities, particularly beef. Some retail grocers were reluctant to raise shelf prices, citing consumersâ€™ price sensitivity. Technology industry contacts recognized stronger downward pressure on prices resulting from more aggressive competition lately. Reports indicated upward pressure on prices of various construction inputs, including wood and cement. Upward wage pressures remained modest overall. Slack in the labor market restrained wage gains in most sectors, occupations, and regions. Firms in various industries continued to compete vigorously for a limited pool of qualified workers, including construction supervisors and software developers, spurring significant wage growth. In particular, reports noted that the pace of wage gains for software developers might have even picked up in recent months. Contacts indicated that some small businesses have boosted compensation packages to minimize voluntary staff turnover. Retail Trade and ServicesAside from spending on big-ticket items and certain technology products, retail sales were a bit soft. Contacts pointed to evidence of pent-up demand and attractive financing opportunities spurring households to purchase big-ticket items, particularly autos and housing-related goods. Contacts in the technology industry expect a near-term pickup in spending on various hardware and software products, including storage, cloud computing-related infrastructure, and enterprise security software. Retail grocers and department store contacts noted flat and sluggish sales, respectively. A beverage retailer also noted that consumer demand was stagnant. On net, luxury items and premium brands sold relatively well, but growth slowed for other categories of full-priced items as consumers continued to search for the lowest prices. Demand for business and consumer services was mixed. Technology contacts noted that, although demand for various technology services ticked up in the U.S. and near-term expectations remain positive, demand in Europe appeared to slip. Reports indicated that demand for discretionary health-care services was somewhat weak. Restaurant industry contacts noted ongoing softness in same-store sales in the quick-service restaurant and casual dining segments of the industry. Travel and tourism activity in Hawaii maintained its solid pace of growth, although contacts noted weaker visitor arrivals from the western United States recently. Contacts noted year-over-year declines in Las Vegas gaming revenues, as the tourism industry there continued to face challenges. ManufacturingDistrict manufacturing activity appeared to inch up during the reporting period of late August through early October. Contacts noted that activity along the supply chain for electronic components improved, and capacity utilization remained near its historical average. Uncertainty about fiscal policy triggered reductions of new orders and revenue in the defense industry. Providers of pharmaceuticals noted increased activity in the biotech drug industry. A wood products manufacturer indicated that demand eased over the summer, and a metal manufacturer noted that production activity slowed a bit. However, demand for steel products used primarily in nonresidential construction edged up further, and steel producers reported that overall capacity utilization was mostly stable. In particular, reports indicated an ongoing trend of stronger capacity utilization for steel manufacturing of automobile and aircraft-related inputs than for nonresidential construction inputs. Agriculture and Resource-related IndustriesAgricultural and resource-related sales and production activity expanded in the District. Demand remained strong for most crop and livestock products. Contacts noted that competition for grapes in the California wine industry contributed to higher prices for grapes, which passed through to raisin prices, reducing sales and increasing inventories of raisins. Water availability was adequate on net but limited in some areas. Overall demand for oil products ticked up. Refinery utilization rates, total refinery inputs, and gasoline production activity increased since the previous reporting period. The stock of stored natural gas was up as well compared with the previous reporting period, but notably down year-over-year. Utility providers reported that consumer energy usage patterns were consistent with ongoing modest growth in consumer spending. Real Estate and ConstructionHousing demand advanced overall, and commercial real estate activity improved. Home prices and sales climbed further in many District cities. Reports indicated that residential permit issuance increased in parts of California but decreased in some areas of the Pacific Northwest. Construction activity ramped up on net, although in some areas, new building activity was held back by factors such as poor lot availability and shortages of skilled construction workers. Contacts indicated that multifamily residential construction projects increased. Rental rates for commercial real estate were stable by some reports and up according to others. Technology and medical services firms in particular drove the growth in demand for commercial real estate in the San Francisco Bay Area and Seattle. Financial InstitutionsFinancial institutions indicated that loan demand rose. Most contacts reported increased lending. Some small businesses in areas with strengthening local economic conditions sought increased financing for equipment or real estate purchases. Some banks reported slower mortgage origination and especially refinancing activity in response to higher interest rates, although rising home price appraisals have sparked increased activity in home equity lending. Reports highlighted ample bank liquidity and substantial competition for high-quality commercial borrowers. Regional and community banks aggressively sought out well-qualified small business borrowers. Demand for asset management and investment advisory services was strong. In the Districtâ€™s Internet and digital media sectors, mergers and acquisitions and venture capital activity grew in terms of both deal value and volume, and the pace of initial public offerings picked up substantially. Private equity financing activity, on the other hand, was mostly flat. 
APAs I said at the beginning of this latest U.S. government fiasco, I think the behavior of the handful of Tea Party zealots over the past couple of weeks is a national disgrace. I get that they want to slash government spending. I get that they feel strongly about that. But lots of people in this country — and in this country's government — feel strongly about lots of things, and they don't go around shutting down the government and threatening to cause the USA to default because they feel strongly about something. (Take gun control, for example. Imagine if a handful of Democrats who are sick of seeing innocent Americans get slaughtered had shut down the government and threatened to default unless the U.S. banned assault rifles. Imagine! The country would have marched on Washington, with its assault rifles, despite the fact that many, many Americans feel extremely strongly about this.) Anyway, the ringleader of these Tea Party Republicans, of course, is Senator Ted Cruz. I think that what Ted Cruz has done over the past few weeks is a particularly egregious disgrace.  Basically, Ted Cruz hijacked the entire government and, thanks to his willingness to exploit every procedural quirk and dirty trick in the book, amassed almost as much power as the president. Even today, after the Senate had agreed to a deal and the House finally agreed not to cause us to default, we were all waiting to see if... Senator Ted Cruz would try to block the deal. And now that Senator Ted Cruz has announced that he will not block the deal — while blasting everyone who votes for it — he looks like a heroic patriot. And that's the other point I need to make about Ted Cruz. In addition to being a national disgrace, his behavior over the past few weeks has been a brilliant career move. Ted Cruz, after all, is just a freshman Senator. But now, thanks to his all-night speech, government shutdown, and irrepressible grandstanding, just about everyone in the country knows who he is. They also know that he's articulate, smart, charming (sometimes), and bold, which are all good things. I can't imagine that I would ever vote for Ted Cruz: I think he's probably smart enough to know that Obamacare and our current deficit won't, in fact, "destroy the country," and, unlike Ted Cruz, I would actually like to find a way to make health care more affordable for millions of Americans. But I will admit that I sort of like Ted Cruz. I like all the attributes above, for example, even if I disagree with many of his policies. I am impressed that anyone could even be standing after an 18-hour speech, let alone still speaking articulately. And I like the fact that Ted Cruz read "Green Eggs And Ham" on the Senate floor. Thanks to Ted Cruz reading "Green Eggs And Ham" on the Senate floor, I have actually smiled at something our government has done this year. That's probably once more than I smiled at something the government did last year. So, well done, Ted Cruz. I'm appalled by what you did to the country over the past few weeks. But I know who you are now. And, on a personal level, anyway, I sort of like you! SEE ALSO: No, The Tea Party Republicans Aren't Patriots »
For as long as we can remember, veteran Wall Street strategist Rich Bernstein has been a bull on small-cap U.S. stocks.Â  And anyone who has followed his adviced has done very well, beating the S&amp;P 500. In recent months, as the outlook for emerging markets deteriorated, the out look for small U.S. companies have held up. â€œMany investors still believe that emerging markets are the best growth story in the world," said Richard Bernstein to Business Insider when he submitted his most important chart in the world. "However, statistics show that it is not the best, but rather it is currently the worst growth story in the world. The chart shows projected earnings growth rates by region. The developed world is now a better growth story than is the emerging world. Most investors hate this chart, but donâ€™t shoot the messenger.â€ Business Insider / RBAdvisors
Check out this teaser from "The Wall Street Code," a new high-frequency trading documentary from Marije Meerman andÂ VPRO, the folks whoÂ made "Quants: The Alchemists of Wall Street." Dave Lauer, former trader at HFT firm Allston trading, recounts what it was like to work during the 2010 flash crash, when the Dow crashed 1000 points only to recover immediately. There was nothing. There was no market for moments, for seconds there was no market. And we're just all sitting there and you're staring into oblivion and you have no idea what is about to happen, but something you that could not possibly have thought could happen just happened. And you're looking at the market, and it's not there. Lauer says he left high-frequency trading a year later, unhappy that many of the country's greatest minds work to extract pennies from the HFT system instead of helping humanity. "Looking back on that day, I lost faith in capitalism or at least what we had built to be capitalism," he says. "I didn't trust it anymore." Here's the trailer (via ZeroHedge's Calibrated Confidence): 
www.flickr.comA financial advisor in London is on trial for allegedly murdering his client who he's also accused of defrauding of $549,000, the Daily Mail reports.Â  David Jeffs, 36, is accused of battering 63-year-old millionaire Roberto Troyan to death with a briefcase in Troyan's Mayfair mansion back in March, according to the report citing claims made in court. Troyan was found lying in a pool of his blood on his kitchen floor by his house cleaner. He died of head injuries. Â  Jeffs is also accused of using Troyan's money to pay for cocaine, bar tabs in high end night clubs, sports cars, and luxurious vacations, according to the report. Â  Jeffs worked for HFM Columbus, Money Marketing reported.Â  Last month, heÂ pleaded not guilty to murder or fraud.
Stephen Lam/ReutersYHOOâ€™s Q3 results for their core business (ex holdings in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan) were highlighted by a continuation of troubling trends (per Barronâ€™s Online): Display ad revenue fell 7%, to $470 million, versus the year-earlier quarter Â The number of ads sold rose 1%, year over year. TheÂ average price per adÂ fell 7%. Search ad revenueÂ fell 8% to $435 million. The number of paid clicks rose 21%, year over year, while theÂ price per click fell 4%. The companyâ€™sÂ Ebitda, on an adjusted basis, was down 19% from the prior-year period, at $331 million. So how on earth is the stock up this morning, just a couple percent from the 8 years highs, the answer is their remaining 24% stake in Alibaba the Chinese online commerce site that is expected to IPO in the U.S. or Hong Kong in the first half of 2014 that will likely sport a market cap north of $100 billion and maybe as high as $200 (to put this in context AMZN has a $139 billion market cap) The investment community is in near universal agreement that there is nothing but upside for YHOO as Alibaba heads towards IPO, that it is a slam dunk that the limited disclosure that investors have on this private CHINESE company are money good and that there wonâ€™t be on road-bumps along the way that make investors re-think that the IPO will be wildly successful and that the performance post deal will be even better. Last night on YHOOâ€™s call they disclosed some data about Alibabaâ€™s fiscal Q2 showing year over year gains in sales up 61%, earnings up 159% led by margins that were far better than most analysts had expected. Â This is the only reason YHOO is up this morning and will likely remain bid into the deal. I did read one intelligent comment on the potential for future eye-popping performance by Alibaba from Bernstein analyst Carlos Kirjner (who rates the shares a Buy with a $40 twelve month price target): We still have doubts on whether the margin trajectory we have seen is indeed the result of fundamental, organic changes, or whether there are effects that are not sustainable in the long term artificially propping up margins (e.g. one-time gains). There are many businesses within Alibaba (e.g., Alibaba.com) and we just donâ€™t know how the different parts are moving. That said we now have two quarters of incremental operating margins much greater than the historical 55% incremental margin we had seen last year, specifically 86% in 1Q13 and 73% in 2Q13. Therefore, in view of the limited data we have, we must assume that the highest probability incremental margin profile for Alibaba is materially higher than the 55% or so Alibaba was showing last year. Perhaps still conservatively, we assume that Alibabaâ€™s incremental contribution margins for 2013 will be 65%, and decline about 300 bps a year towards 55%, which we think is roughly in line to what e-Bay gets or can get in its Marketplaces business. The take-away here is that analyst just donâ€™t know how to model future growth, but despite that fact, analysts have not been more conservative about Alibabaâ€™s value. Â IN the same note to clients, Kirjner lays out his comparable valuation method for Alibaba: We value Alibaba on a DCF basis, ascribing TaoBao and TMall a valuation of ~$183 billion, and the Â remaining assets (e.g., Aliyun, eTao, AliExpress, and the stake on AliPay) another ~$7 billion, to get to Â our valuation. This corresponds to 30x times our estimate of 2015 net income, which is now $6.1 billion. Note that Tencent trades at 30x 2015 adjusted EPS, with Tencent consensus 2015 earnings growing around ~25%, while we expect Alibabaâ€™s to grow 36% in 2015. With the same PEG ratio, we would have a valuation of roughly $220 billion for Alibaba. Well there you have it people, just because all the other Chinese Internet companies trade at ludicrous valuations, this one should too, and YHOOâ€™s stake in Alibaba has basically rendered their new CEO Marissa Mayer a portfolio manger of Asian internet stock holdings with the side hobby of either winding down their existing business and using the Asian cash to figure out a plan in Social and Mobile almost 5 years after their fiercest competitors have done. I dont have any problems with YHOO, with Mayer, or her evolving plan. Â I think she is likely the most fortunate CEO on the planet, brought in to turn around a pig of a company while reaping the benefits of a $1 billion investment from 8 years ago that will afford her the opportunity to buy startups with no revenue for $27 million just to hire the 17 year old founder. To own YHOO here is to take the leap of faith that the mania in internet stocks both here and abroad has legs. Â Tencent in Hong Kong is up almost 80% from its lows in April when it was down on the year, while BIDU is up 82% since the April lows when also was down on the year. Â What has changed since the spring?? and why couldnâ€™t it revert back?? Â To me, this mania is a fairly new found thing, but these companies have gained tens of billions of dollars of market cap with only marginally improving results vs previous expectations. Â Just because everything is going up doesnâ€™t mean it will continue to do so. I guess I will just leave this rant with one last thought â€“ YHOO has been a very unique investment, and those that understood that to be long the stock when Mayer took over more than a year ago had little to do with their core business and all to do with their investments absolutely nailed it. Â We were in that camp in Sept 2012 when the stock was $16 (here), but now, to initiate new longs at current levels, with the current backdrop, you are probably better off buying TSLA!
Hedge fund manager David Einhorn has been an outspoken critic of "QE-infinity," as some call it — the seemingly unending Fed policy of buying $85 billion worth of bonds every month. He even wrote a Huffington Post column about it last year called  'The Fed's Jelly Donut Policy" where he equated the Fed's policy with Homer Simpson's addiction to jelly donuts. So in his latest investor letter, when commenting on the Fed's decision not to taper quantitative easing, Einhorn didn't sound happy, but did write that his hedge fund had a little party to mark the occasion. No one is sure what the Fed is focused on. After spending several months bracing the market for fewer QE donuts, the Fed decided that it was premature to taper. Even a token reduction (from a baker’s dozen to a dozen?) was ruled out despite the fact that the economic trajectory has not materially changed. We responded the next morning with our own stimulus by ordering jelly donuts for the entire office. In his Huffington Post column, Einhorn argued that "Chairman Bernanke is presently force-feeding us what seems like the 36th Jelly Donut of easy money..." so we hope no one at Greenlight over-ate. However, the idea we're not sure what the Fed is focused on, seems a little tired at this point. The rumors that QE was ending alone were enough to set the market into a tizzy this summer. And then suddenly, everything that indicated that the recovery was coming started to backslide. Everything that Bernanke has said time and time again that he's focusing on — like employment and the housing recovery. Just go back to September's meeting when Bernanke made this point himself. Business Insider's Matt Boesler wrote "Bernanke Clearly Felt The Need To Correct A Big Mistake" after that announcement — that the chairman realized his June statements led those who read Central Bank tea leaves (necessary or not) to speculate that the taper was coming. But this should all be a lesson in expectation versus reality. In June, there was a lot more optimism about the economy all-around. Interest rates were rising on that sentiment, and even the Fed revised its expectations up. So here's what Bernanke said about QE then: "Yes, rates have come up some. That's in part due to more optimism – I think – about the economy. It's in part due to perceptions of the Federal Reserve. The forecasts that our participants submitted for this meeting, of course, were done in the last few days, so they were done with full knowledge of what happened to financial conditions. Rates have tightened some, but other factors have been more positive – increasing house prices, for example." The problem with those expectations, though, is that they didn't play out in reality. The housing recovery started to lose steam and the U.S. consumer started to falter and lose confidence. Conditions moved away from where Bernanke said they should be to initiate the taper. Interest rates were already rising slightly at the time (starting in May) and what little they rose impacted the economy negatively. Just take a look at bank earnings. Across the board, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup reported declines in their mortgage businesses as fewer Americans took out mortgages or refinanced.  And across the board, those declines significantly hurt each bank's bottom line. Einhorn wrote last year that Bernanke was "wondering why it [QE] isn't giving us energy or making us feel better." But that doesn't seem to be the case though either. Over and over again pundits, politicians, and Bernanke himself have said that the Fed's powers are limited. The Fed needs help from policy (and its makers) to bring the American economy around. Until that happens, Bernanke has said that he's committed to doing whatever (little) he can to enable a recovery by continuing QE and not raising interest rates before we're ready. Here's what Bernanke said about that back in 2012: I sometimes hear the complaint that the Federal Reserve is enabling bad fiscal policy by keeping interest rates very low and thereby making it cheaper for the federal government to borrow. I find this argument unpersuasive. The responsibility for fiscal policy lies squarely with the Administration and the Congress. At the Federal Reserve, we implement policy to promote maximum employment and price stability, as the law under which we operate requires. ...Suppose, notwithstanding our legal mandate, the Federal Reserve were to raise interest rates for the purpose of making it more expensive for the government to borrow. Such an action would substantially increase the deficit, not only because of higher interest rates, but also because the weaker recovery that would result from premature monetary tightening would further widen the gap between spending and revenues... So that's Bernanke's focus — helping the economy along until it's ready and "avoid(ing) a tightening until the economy is growing the way we want it to be" as he said during the last Fed announcement.  If Einhorn wants to end QE, he should go to Washington and ask the politicians down there to help the Fed out with some decent policy. I know, funny.

Google FinanceThe U.S. stock markets are surging today. The Dow is up 180 points. The S&amp;P 500 is up 20 points.  These moves reflect gains of 1.2%. Moments ago, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell announced a deal that would raise the debt limit and reopen the government. This announcement appears to have been mostly priced into the markets. Late Tuesday night, Senators were telling news outlets that their efforts to pass a budget deal was "on track" and "very close." The Dow was up as muchas 204 points earlier today.
Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesA student at the University of Wisconsin â€” Milwaukee is making waves in the financial world for all the wrong reasons after an awful email he sent to a recruiter is going viral. The email â€” originally posted on BroBible â€” is a cringeworthy read in which the student reminds the recruiter about a zit he had when they met and reveals his fears about how a high-pressure job may affect his love life.

Maybe that helps you recall, maybe not. Not completely important, I suppose. Anyways, if you have a chance here is my question: (background first) I interviewed with BDO and Baker Tilly today, two firms that seem like good places to work, I believe they don't kill you like a big 4.Â TomorrowÂ I have an interview with Deloitte :O somewhere I thought I've always wanted to work. Obviously I don't have an offer so this is all hypothetical thinking, but if I get the job, the reality of the situation is that I'm getting old. 25. I know you can't force love and I know it just comes when you're not looking, but would working for a big four completely squash any possibilities for potential relationships if one came along?

Some readers saw the Barron's front-page article on Puerto Rico and its financial problems. The details of the debt burdens of Puerto Rico make for an ugly picture. Puerto Rico bonds are ubiquitous. They are tax-free in all state jurisdictions because of the particular nature of Puerto Rico's territorial commonwealth status. Many mutual funds hold (or held) them because they can be placed in state-specific funds and in more general funds. We have seen five months of mutual fund liquidation pressure, which originated in part with Puerto Rico credit risk. The pressure was exacerbated by tapering talk from the Federal Reserve and again intensified with the federal political impasse. Other credit-related events such as Detroit's bankruptcy added fuel to the liquidation fire. Where do we stand now? The Puerto Rico Commonwealth debt obligations are rated Baa3 by Moody's, BBB- by Standard &amp; Poor's, and BBB- by Fitch. Some other securities issued by Puerto Rican agencies are below investment grade. The ratings just recited are the lowest of the low investment grades. Market-based pricing in Puerto Rico debt reflects market perceptions of imminent cash exhaustion. We see PR bonds that are backed by Assured Guaranty, the US bond insurer, trading at yields close to 7%. We see uninsured, unenhanced Puerto Rico credits trading at double-digit yields. And we see short-term Puerto Rico debt trading at annualized yields well into double digits. The market is saying that Puerto Rico could run out of cash. This market-based pricing suggests that Puerto Rico could default, declare some legal action, or otherwise jeopardize the payment stream to bond holders. We think that is a very serious risk. Market based pricing suggests that PR will not easily â€œrollâ€ its maturing debt. The political questions surrounding Puerto Rico are equally complex. Puerto Rico is a sovereign commonwealth; it is not a state or city. It has never held a vote to support an application for statehood in the US. Puerto Rican residents do have US citizenship status. If Puerto Rico were to bankrupt or default and then try to achieve statehood in the US, would it be accepted? There is no reference in American history regarding the legal status of a territorial jurisdiction like Puerto Rico seeking direct assistance and federal guarantees under conditions like these.Â  PR has benefitted by many special tax treatment related subsidies in the IRS code. Additional serious political questions arise out of the imbroglio currently playing out in Washington, DC. If the federal government does not inject money into a city like Detroit, Harrisburg, or Stockton, would that same federal government use the US credit to support the refinancing of Puerto Rican debt? All of the political questions involving Puerto Rico are profound and their answers highly uncertain, but we believe that a bailout of Puerto Rico is unlikely in the present political environment in Washington. Cumberland has not taken any positions in Puerto Rico that are in unenhanced credits. We have avoided them. When clients hold them in accounts that come in, we attempt to sell them, and those sales are increasingly difficult. We have held Puerto Rico bonds that are pre-refunded: that means they are secured by an escrow of US Treasury obligations. And we have held bonds that are guaranteed by Assured Guaranty, Inc. AG is rated favorably by both Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's. Would we buy new bonds in Puerto Rico if they were insured? The answer is, probably not. And we doubt that insurers would take on more PR risk. Would we buy any of the unenhanced Puerto Rican debt or standalone credit? The answer is, definitely not. In contrast to a separate-account manager such as Cumberland Advisors, the mutual fund manager faces an acute difficulty. Let me describe it in the following way. A mutual fund manager has a collective fund of tax-free bonds and may be facing shareholder redemptions. That means the manager must sell, raise cash, and pay the shareholders on demand. If the manager owns some Puerto Rico debt and must sell it, enormous losses will be taken, because the pricing of that debt is as I have described. There is no longer the ability to easily sell Puerto Rico debt. So what can be sold by the fund manager instead? The highest-grade, most liquid, and easily traded securities can be sold. However, if mutual fund A is facing redemptions, it is likely that mutual funds B, C, D, and E are also facing them. So the natural buyers for the bonds held by A become sellers instead, just like manager A is a seller. The end result is wholesale selling, and the selling by mutual funds is across the board, not idiosyncratic to one fund. Who is on the buy side? Only separate-account managers who can cherry pick the offerings. That is what we do. We look at bid-wanted lists. The bids we give are bids that we think are bargain bids for bonds that we know we want to buy for our clients. Do we see Puerto Rico bonds offered? Yes, of course. They are distressed sales coming from institutions that are under pressure. That is the time when a separate account can be opportunistic. Taking advantage of opportunities is what we try to do, but only when we believe those opportunities will pan out. We seriously question whether Puerto Rico can make it. There are arguments being put forth about using casino revenues, sales tax revenue, and other collateral to secure financing. We are skeptical. We think the commonwealth is facing huge difficulty in rolling over their maturing debt. The climactic Puerto Rico chapters of the municipal bond book are being written now. We advise reading and watching with professional interest. But we do not advise owning Puerto Rico. We want to offer some special thanks to Natalie Cohen, Head of Municipal Research at Wells Fargo Securities, for her excellent work in the municipal bond arena and specifically on Puerto Rico. We also want to note that the slides and presentations made at the October 10-11, 2013, Global Interdependence Center conference in Bermuda are now posted on the GIC website, www.interdependence.org. Included in those presentations and slides is an entire section on municipal debt. It includes comments about Detroit, among other jurisdictions, and references Puerto Rico. The participants in the first session on cities were Peter Gold of the Peter Gold Group, Mary Francoeur of Assured Guaranty, and Dennis Archer, former mayor of Detroit. The second session was moderated by my colleague John Mousseau and included presentations by Catherine Mann of Brandeis University and Robert Kurtter of Moody's Investors Service. Those presentations focused on municipal credit and the issues of cities â€“ whether they can be saved, how they can be saved, and the mechanics of municipal finance. I can report to you that during those two sessions that morning, the attendees were very attentive and strongly responsive to the information that was presented. In fact, I would say that people were riveted. We encourage readers to view those presentations. In some cases, new data was presented that had not previously been broadly shared in an open-forum conference.
JP Morgan will admit some wrongdoing and pay a $100 million fine. "On February 29, just ahead of the month-end testing of their marks, the traders believed the portfolio’s situation was grave. That day, desperate to avoid further losses, the traders developed a resolve, as they put it, to 'defend the position,'" the CFTC writes. "Recognizing that the sheer size of their position in IG9 10Y had the potential to affect or influence the market, the traders recklessly sold massive amounts of protection on the IG9 10Y. They were short protection and they sold more protection." The "wrongdoing" concession represents a broader shift from Washington regulators, who for decades let banks more or less off the hook with a financial slap on the wrist but no admission of guilt. The New York Times' Ben Protess and Jessica Silver-Greenberg reported last night: For the government, an admission by JPMorgan could provide a template for pursuing other admissions in Wall Street cases. Already, according to people briefed on the matter, the Justice Department is pushing JPMorgan to admit that from 2005 to 2007, it sold mortgage securities to investors without fully warning of the risks. JP Morgan recently announced it will set aside billions of dollars to cover legal expenses associated with several federal investigations. Last week, the bank reported its first quarterly loss under CEO Jamie Dimon. Check out the full release from the CTFC&gt;

REUTERS/ Gary CameronThe National Association of Home Builders has released its housing market index, a gauge of homebuilder confidence. The index came in at 55, below economist expectations of 57. September's 58 print was revised down a point, to 57. Any reading over 50 means that builders believe conditions are good. "Builder optimism remains above 50 and we are still seeing signs of pent-up demand in many markets across the country,â€ NAHB Chairman Rick Judson said in a statement. â€œThis slight dip in builder sentiment is the result of continuing challenges in the marketplace with regard to the cost and availability of labor and lots and uncertainty in Washingtonâ€ "The pace of housing starts has not been keeping up with increases in sentiment in recent months, and, as a result, we expect sentiment to taper off a bit until we see a stronger pickup in construction activity," Barclays wrote to clients last week. Since the FOMC's decision to not taper its asset purchasing program in September, mortgage rates have dipped, which may spur some buyers to "pull the trigger," according to Wells Fargo. "However, with increased turmoil in Washington weighing on the outlook, it would not be surprising to see builder confidence dip in October." Click here to see the full statement from the NAHBÂ Â»

APThe 2013 debt ceiling crisis and federal government shutdown are almost over.Â  House Speaker John Boehner has agreed to take up the Senate's plan to raise the nation's borrowing limit and reopen the government, National Review's Robert Costa reports. Boehner will allow the bill to pass with mostly Democratic votes.Â  Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas) also told Bloomberg that Boehner will bring the Senate bill up for a vote. Stocks are flying up on the news. The Dow was up 180 points in early trading. There's still the question of whether the final bill will be able to get to President Barack Obama's desk by the Oct. 17 debt-ceiling deadline.Â  The House could take up the measure first, according to sources, which would remove some procedural obstacles and allow for quicker Senate passage. Senate Republicans have also been publicly urging Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), the most likely senator to hold up passage of any Senate legislation, to relent and allow it to move quickly. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell are close to a dealÂ that would fund the government through mid-January and raise the debt ceiling through Feb. 7. It also will set up a budget conference that would end no later than Dec. 13. A Democratic aide said the final deal will likely includeÂ an income-verification system for individuals and families receiving subsidies through the Affordable Care Act. But it won't likely include a one-year delay in the law's "reinsurance tax,"Â a provision that is designedÂ to spread risk among insurers and stabilize premiums in the first three years of the law. The aide also said that under the deal, the Treasury Department will still be able to use "extraordinary measures" to work around the debt ceiling in the case that it is not raised by Feb. 7. This was a key White House priority. "Should be included and allowed," the aide said. Boehner's final decision comes after a conservative revolt led to a blow up on House leadership's plans to pass its own legislationÂ on Tuesday. Conservatives did not think the legislation did enough to fundamentally change Obamacare.
Associated PressSupreme Court Justices Stephen Breyer, left, and Antonin Scalia testify on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, Oct. 5, 2011.The New Yorker's Jeffrey Toobin has a new column on a seemingly arcane Supreme Court case he says could bring the government to a new level of paralysis and dysfunction. "The current spectacle of government dysfunction in Washington could scarcely be worse, right? Wrong, actually," he writes. The case that could make things worse, National Labor Relations Board V. Canning, seeks to limit the president's ability to make appointments of federal officials while the Senate is in recess. It is scheduled for some time this term. Obama has used this power to get around the inevitable stalemate he encounters when he tries to get the Senate to approve his appointments to agencies like the NLRB or SEC. We can expect to see an even more dysfunctional federal government if the Supreme Court limits the president's ability to make these appointments, Toobin predicts. Republicans have abused the filibuster at every turn to block Obama's nominees. If the court limits his ability to make recess appointments, he'll have a very tough time appointing officials to federal agencies â€” especially ones Republicans hate like the NLRB. "The budget deadlock has frozen the current operations of existing government agencies," Toobin writes, "but the case before the justices will determine whether some of these agencies will exist at all." In NRLB v. Canning, the Supreme Court will decide whether the president can make recess appointments during brief Senate breaks or only during the longer, formal break between sessions that happens once a year, The New York Times reports. Supreme Court veteran Carter Phillips has called the recess appointments fight the court's most important case this term. "It is a very interesting constitutional problem involving the fundamental relationship among the branches of the federal government and a practice that has been around a long time," he told BI in an email message. "If unconstitutional it will probably mean the end of recess appointments, which makes it a landmark political change."
Flickr / misconmikeAs the government shutdown goes into its 16th day and Congress painstakingly inches closer to a deal on the debt limit, the price of short-term Treasury bills have been tanking, sending yields soaring. This appears to be reflecting concerns that the Treasury Department may not be able to pay lenders when this liabilities come due.  However, one analyst believes this is a great time to buy this short-term government debt on the cheap.  Here's Carl Weinberg of High Frequency Economics:Â Â  "Strategies abound for avoiding a default on T-bills, notes and bonds. We do not have to go into all of them here, but you can be sure Treasury has a plan B as well as plans C, D and E to avoid disaster. It has had plenty of time to work on them. Prioritizing payments to cover the debt is an obvious strategy. A more sophisticated plan would be to roll over maturing debt into super-high-coupon long-term bonds that would sell at a huge premium over par. Yes, Treasury will be selling bonds even after the debt ceiling is reached to roll over maturing bills and notes. Take a maturing bill with a face value of $100 and roll it over into a 20% coupon 30-year bond with a $100 face value. That long term bond would raise $400 in cash at an auction in today's market yields, but the rollover would not increase the debt...."

Patrick Semansky / APIt's Halftime, everyone.The first batch of earnings reports are in, and the picture is mixed. First, the main takeaways from the banks, JPM, WFC, and C: Yesterday, 2 major consumer staples companies reported – KO and JNJ.  Key points: Meanwhile, retailers have been struggling.  YUM and COST missed on both revenues and earnings (though COST reacted much better), while other retailers like GPS and LVMH have also missed expectations.  The widely cited Gallup poll shows a rapid loss of confidence among U.S. consumers due to the ongoing political impasse. Tech sector earnings are about to hit in earnest too.  Both INTC and YHOO beat this quarter’s expectations but lowered future estimates.  Tech bellwether reports continue today – EBAY and IBM report today after the close.  GOOG reports tomorrow afternoon.  We’ll have an IBM cheat sheet and a GOOG full preview later today.
CBSJohn Chambers, the chairman of the sovereign ratings committee at S&amp;P, said Wednesday morning that a U.S. default would amount to an economic catastrophe worse than the collapse of Lehman Brothers.Â  When asked if the ratings agency would consider a second downgrade of the U.S.'s credit rating in little more than two years, Chambers told CBS "This Morning" that the agency would "look and see" how Congress responds over the next few days.Â  Chambers also explained, neatly, the glaring absurdity of the debt ceiling crisis: "We have a budget system thatâ€™s unlike any other budget system that Iâ€™m familiar with. We have spending and revenue measures that have originated from an original act in Congress. Now itâ€™s a question of funding them. The spending has already been approved, but now the elected officials are balking at funding that spending." It'd be worse than Lehman Brothers, he said, and it'd be "needless." During the last debt-ceiling crisis in 2011, the S&amp;P stripped the U.S. of its AAA credit rating, citing political instability. Fitch revised the outlook on their rating to negative from stable on Wednesday â€” citing, again, political instability. An agreement in the Senate to raise the debt ceiling and reopen the government looks imminent, as Majority Leader Harry Reid and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell worked late into the night Tuesday to hash out a deal. It would fund the government through mid-January and raise the debt ceiling through Feb. 7.Â It also would set up a budget conference that would end no later than Dec. 13. Here's the clip of Chambers' CBS appearance: 
The US debt ceiling was hit several months ago and the Treasury Dept has been taking extraordinary measures since to avoid hitting the debt ceiling. It is these measures Treasury Secretary Lew indicated were going to be exhausted no later than Oct 17. That means that they may already be exhausted. The government then operates on a cash and income basis, ironically, like so many households. There is a large bill payment, $120 bln, due tomorrow. The government has funds to cover this. It also needs to be recognized that the Treasury Department raised $13 bln in new cash in yesterday's bill auction. Essentially, this coupled with Lew's indication that the Treasury will have about $30 bln cash, gives the government around $40 bln. Moreover, the size of today's bill auction ($68 bln) suggest that there is slightly more room under the debt ceiling than many had estimated. If there is a material deadline, it is a week from now, when $93 bln of bills are due (Oct 24). That said, we suspect the US will be able to roll over those bills when the time comes. We note that although participation in yesterday's bill auctions were less than the recent average, both the 3- and 6-month bills were oversubscribed more than three times.  Fitch placed its US rating on negative credit watch, citing the failure to lift the debt ceiling.  Like nearly every one else, Fitch too expected the debt ceiling to be raised soon.  Fitch says its will resolved its negative watch by Q1 2014.   Moody's, which retains a AAA rating on the US, also said not only that it anticipates the debt ceiling to be raised, but also provocatively indicated that expects that the US will pay interest and principal on its debt even if the ceiling is not raised.   Sterling is among the strongest of the major currencies, rising to its best level since October 9.  It has been buoyed by the largest decline in the unemployment claimant count since mid-1997.  The 41.7k decline, coupled with the revision to the August series, puts the claimant count decline twice the 25k that the consensus expected.  The ILO measure of unemployment, that the BOE's forward guidance refers to remained at 7.7%.   Yet the real disappointment with the report was the average week earnings (3-month year-over-year) slipped to 0.7% in August (an extra month lag) from a revised 1.2% in July.  The weak earnings growth and firm price pressures erodes the real purchasing power of British households and over time is likely to weigh on consumption and, through that,  weaken the economy.  Sterling has risen to test its 20-day moving average (~$1.6060) and has broken the down trend that has been in place since the start of the month.  A move above $1.6080-90 would be the first compelling indication that the bearish head and shoulders top pattern that we identified is not valid.  Meanwhile firm New Zealand inflation  underscores expectations for a RBNZ rate hike in early 2014.  New Zealand reported Q3 CPI rose 1.4% from a year ago compared with a 0.7% pace in Q2.  The market consensus was for an acceleration to 1.2%.   The New Zealand dollar has outperformed over the past week is is challenging the multi-month high set in on Sept 19 near $0.8435.  The high for the year was set in April near $0.8675 and that appears to be what many are looking at.   Yet part of the recent demand has been linked to foreign demand for the NZD2.5 bln 2030 bond recently issued.  There are two developments in Europe to note today.  First, and the most predictable, is that talks between Germany's CDU and the Greens have broken down.  This enhances the SPD's negotiating position.  Merkel does not want to lead a minority government.  She has made this clear and it makes sense politically give the numerous contentious issues that have to be addressed.  The SPD has jettisoned references to a joint European bond, but is pushing its domestic agenda.   As realpolitik would have even though the CDU/CSU needs only a few votes in parliament, the SPD are demanding she deals for them all.  That is the SPD are demanding half the ministerial posts, including Finance and is pushing for half of the cabinet to be women.  In this vein, we note the recent junior ministerial shake up in the UK resulted in the elevation of several women and that Yellen will likely become the first woman to head up a major central bank.  Second, auto registrations ( a proxy for sales) rose in Europe by about 5.5%, the largest increase in a couple of years.  Many talk about the rise in London house prices as a key economic driver in the UK's recovery, but this is not to do the auto sector justice.  Unlike most countries in Europe, UK auto sales have been robust.  They rose 12.1% in September and are up about 8% this year.   The real surprise was in Spain,w here auto sales jumped over 28%,encouraged by new incentives.  top st  French auto sales also edged up by 3.4%.  Germany and Italy reported small declines.  There were extra sales days in September, so it may take another month's read to feel confident that a corner has been turned.  Lastly, we note some corporate news.  A news report suggests that Apple has told assemblers of its low cost 5c iPhone that it is cutting its order by as much as 20% in Q4.  Most of the suppliers are in east Asia.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index was flat earlier today.  The MSCI Emerging Markets equity index is snapping off nearly 2%.   In Europe, where the Dow Jones Stoxx 600 is off by about 0.3% near midday in London, two stories caught our attention.  First, the CAC is leading the weakest in the euro area, off 0.75%, weighed down in part by disappointing Q3 sales and guidance by Danone.  The luxury good maker LMVH also reported disappointing revenue numbers and the shares were punished.   Second, Italy's bourse is outpeforming today, gaining about 0.5%, helped apparently by an investment banks favorable comments about Telecom Italia and evidence that the Letta government is strong enough to continue to push a modest reform agenda.  Read more posts on Marc to Market »
REUTERS/Alexander DemianchukVisitors look at each other in an Ames room at a private exhibition of optical Illusions in St.Petersburg, September 24, 2013.Everyone is quite freaked out and a little confused about the October 17 debt ceiling. But many experts believe fears are a bit premature and perhaps overblown. "What we don't get is why Oct. 17 is considered the day the U.S. defaults," pondered Greg Valliere, a political analyst for Potomac Research Group. "That probably would not come for another week — but the media, the markets and most politicians have bought into the narrative that tomorrow is the real deadline." You see, hitting the debt ceiling means that the Treasury Department no longer has the authority to raise money by issuing bonds. This doesn't mean that the Treasury is broke. While this is a big deal, this is not a default. If there's one thing confused American's need to know about the debt ceiling, it's this: after hitting the debt ceiling, the Treasury Department will have roughly $30 billion to continue paying its obligations. Experts believe this buys the U.S. around a week or two before we run into serious trouble. "Going past the October 17 deadline is likely to exacerbate those and could deal another blow to confidence," said Goldman Sachs' Jan Hatzius. "That said, the practical implications of going past October 17 are manageable." Hitting the debt ceiling very well could bring volatility to the markets. But experts believe things will only get really ugly if the government fails to repay its bondholders in a timely manner. So why all the panic and confusion? Morgan Stanley's Vincent Reinhart blames/thanks Treasury Secretary Jack Lew. From Reinhart's Tuesday note to clients: Secretary Jack Lew’s main contribution has been to convince legislators that a soft date is scarily hard, keeping politicians negotiating in advance of what they believe is the crack of doom. What the Treasury has explained is that on October 17th, it will only have $30 billion in cash in its account at the Federal Reserve, it will have exploited all extraordinary measures for which there is precedent, and that it will not consider schemes to protect coupon and principal payments at the expense of other Treasury claimants. There are multiple qualifiers in that statement, the most important of which is that the Treasury anticipates still having cash. Default is the event pressed upon the Treasury when the risk materializes of over-drafting at its fiscal agent, the Federal Reserve, which cannot lend directly to the Treasury. With cash still expected in the till, October 17th is really not the event horizon, even before considering expanding the frontier of extraordinary measures before or on that day. Lew debt ceiling sparked a sense of much needed urgency. However, the cost may be unwarranted volatility in the markets in the near-term.
Morgan StanleyIf Congress is unable to produce a budget deal today, the U.S. will hit its October 17 debt ceiling, which is when the Treasury Department will no longer have the authority to borrow money by issuing Treasury securities like T-Bills, T-Notes, and T-Bonds. The stock market has been pretty sanguine considering the near-term uncertainty. Then again, the stock market is a long-term investment vehicle. Uncertainty is manifesting in short-term securities, particularly in Treasury bills where yields continue to blow out on fears that the government won't pay up when these securities mature. Morgan Stanley's Hans Redekar included this chart (above) of the T-Bill yield and the 5-year U.S. credit-default swap (CDS) spread, which measures the cost of insuring against a credit event like a default.  Yields and spreads are blowing out reflecting investors' worry about the near-term. Here's Morgan Stanley's Hans Redekar in a note that was published earlier today: Down to the wire. The US debt ceiling negotiations paused yesterday, suggesting that it is more likely to go right to the October 17 deadline before an agreement is reached. Meanwhile, the pressure is mounting from both the credit agencies and markets. Fitch has placed the US on negative watch as a result of the debt ceiling negotiations while the yields on US bills have spiked higher. The USD performance has been mixed so far, with gains against the low yielders within the G10, but struggling against the traditional high-beta currencies. The heightened uncertainty could see the USD pause even against the low yielders. FX volatility, which has been on a downward trend despite the rise in volatility in other asset market, could also spike. Leaders will meet again today in their effort to pass a budget deal which is currently being described as "on track" and "very close."
REUTERS/Eric ThayerAsset management behemoth BlackRock announced Q3 earnings increased by 15% to $3.88 per share, which was right in line with expectations. "The current investment environment presents a wide range of challenges for our clients," said CEO Larry Fink.  "Fundamentals continue to be outweighed by policy decisions and global growth is dictated more by central bankers and elected officials than business leaders. This uncertainty is keeping many investors on the sidelines, at exactly the time they need to be investing to plan for their futures." Meanwhile, BlackRock's assets under management hit a staggering $4.096 trillion in Q3. “While crossing the $4 trillion asset threshold was another milestone in our growth story, it only encourages us to continue pursuing the many opportunities we have to grow in the future, as we deliver the full value of our diverse platform, solutions-oriented investment culture and leading risk management capabilities to our clients regardless of market conditions.”

The company also benefited from improved credit quality and lower expenses. These factors were partially offset by lower mortgage banking income and the negative impact from remeasuring certain deferred tax assets due to the U.K. corporate income tax rate reduction enacted in July 2013.

REUTERS/Joshua RobertsThe statue of Grief and History stands in front of the Capitol Dome in Washington, October 15, 2013.Good morning! Here's what you need to know.
Billionaire Warren Buffett surprised attendees at Fortune's Most Powerful Women Summit last night by performing the song "The Glory of Love" with Glenn Close. Here's the video via Fortune Magazine via Dan Primack: 
ABCSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) A short-term debt deal won't end fierce dynamics that killed past bids for a bigger accord WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Hold the champagne. Even if Congress reaches a last-minute or deadline-busting deal to avert a federal default and fully reopen the government, elected officials are likely to return to their grinding brand of brinkmanship â€” perhaps repeatedly. House-Senate talks are barely touching the underlying causes of debt-and-spending stalemates that pushed the country close to economic crises in 2011, last December and again this month. Late Tuesday, the GOP-controlled House dropped efforts to craft a bill to raise the debt limit and fully open the government. House members will wait for the Democratic-controlled Senate to act, which could push a final resolution past Thursday. That's when administration officials say federal borrowing powers will be tapped out. Still, many in Congress expect a resolution, even if it's a few days late. At best, however, lawmakers and the White House will agree to fund the government and raise the debt limit for only a few months. They also will call for yet another bipartisan effort to address the federal debt's major causes, including restricted revenue growth and entitlement benefits that rise automatically. And yet, top advocates say they've seen virtually no change in the political dynamics that stymied past efforts for a compromise to end the cycle of brinksmanship and threats to harm the economy. Republicans still adamantly oppose tax increases. Powerful interest groups and many Democrats still fiercely oppose cuts in Social Security and Medicare benefits. And congressional rules still tempt lawmakers to threaten economic havoc â€” by sending the nation into default â€” if the opposing party doesn't yield to their demands. "We're probably going to have to go through this a few more times," said Bob Bixby of the bipartisan Concord Coalition, which advocates budget reforms. Even if a compromise plan this month wins House, Senate and White House approval, Bixby said, it will leave fundamental problems that "they haven't done anything to address." Henry J. Aaron, a Brookings Institution scholar who supports unprecedented legal action to avert future debt showdowns, agreed that three or four months of breathing room is a small victory. "If all we achieve is a repetition of this charade," Aaron said, "we will not have achieved much." The political landscape is littered with once-hopeful bipartisan efforts to reach a "grand bargain" â€” or even a modest bargain â€” to slow the growth of the nation's $16.7 trillion debt and to make spending and revenue trends more sustainable. There was the Simpson-Bowles plan, first issued in 2010, and revised early this year. The revised version called for about $1.3 trillion in new revenues over 10 years, from various sources (about half the original plan's target). It would slow the growth rate of Social Security benefits and raise the eligibility age. It would limit popular tax deductions such as those for charitable gifts and mortgage interest. The Simpson-Bowles plan remains widely praised nationwide, and largely ignored in Congress. Then there were the 2011 secret talks between President Barack Obama and House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. Boehner suggested $800 billion in new revenues over 10 years â€” less than Obama wanted â€” in exchange for widespread spending cuts, including curbs on Medicare and Social Security. It was never clear whether Obama could have pushed the plan through the Democratic-controlled Senate. It didn't matter, because Boehner's GOP colleagues vehemently objected when details leaked, and the talks collapsed. Efforts last year to revive negotiations also failed. A bipartisan congressional "supercommittee" fared no better. Both parties had agreed to supposedly unbearable "sequester" spending cuts to goad each other into big compromises to find a better way. But negotiations faltered and the clumsy-by-design sequester cuts â€” automatic and across the board â€” became law this year. All these efforts failed for the same basic reasons. Liberals and conservatives, Democrats and Republicans, would have had to swallow painful concessions that they don't believe are warranted. The lure of the "common good" couldn't match the power of sharply partisan regions and districts whose voters vow to punish lawmakers who compromise. Republicans oppose higher taxes, even though today's taxation levels are relatively low, historically. Democrats oppose curbs in the growth of Medicare and Social Security, even though analysts for years have said the automatic growth of these "entitlement" programs is unsustainable long-term. Americans are accustomed to relatively high levels of government service at relatively low levels of taxation. Millions are unwilling to undo that arrangement in pursuit of deficit reduction. That makes it easier for powerful, well-financed groups to resist almost any change in government programs or taxes that favor them. "We've been extremely adamant that Social Security shouldn't be part of this discussion at all," said David Certner, legislative counsel for AARP, the big lobbying group for seniors. Social Security has its own funding source â€” a payroll tax â€” Certner said, and it must not "become a piggybank for other programs." As for Medicare, Certner said, he has never seen so many AARP members loudly declaring, "these are my benefits, I've paid into them over the years," and they must not be reduced. Countless other interest groups take similarly unyielding stands, say lawmakers and advocates on all sides of the debate. Bixby said such groups "will never be part of a solution." The bipartisan budget conferees who are envisioned in the debt-and-shutdown proposals in Congress may start with fairly small ambitions, such as looking for ways to replace some of the more painful "sequester" cuts with spending reductions elsewhere. It's not clear whether that would avert another government shutdown and default threat in a few months. The best hope, Bixby said, is to somehow find "a centrist coalition to pass something" that includes new revenues and curbs to entitlements. But so far, he said, "the consensus has been to shut down rather than compromise." With a bipartisan accord so hard to reach, some advocates say the president and the courts must find a way to stop congressional factions from extracting concessions from the president's party by threatening a default on U.S. obligations. Aaron said it's legally contradictory to empower Congress to enact spending laws and then threaten to block the higher borrowing cap needed to pay the bills lawmakers incurred. Aaron wrote in The New York Times, "Failure to raise the debt will force the president to break a law â€” the only question is which one." The Constitution, he said, requires the president to spend what Congress tells him to spend, collect only those taxes Congress approves "and to borrow no more than Congress authorizes." Aaron says Obama should ignore the debt ceiling if Congress refuses to lift it in time. The White House rejects that idea, and even Aaron concedes it probably would trigger an impeachment and massive court challenge. Rep. John Fleming, R-La., summed up the challenge any new bipartisan conferees will face. Asked how the two parties might reach an accord, Fleming suggested Democrats must cave. "America is catching on to the fact that we have a president who seems unlikely to solve America's problems," he said. "We have two totally different visions of America." ___ Follow Charles Babington on Twitter at https://twitter.com/cbabington Copyright (2013) Associated Press. All rights reserved.

REUTERS/James Lawler DugganBillionaire investor Warren Buffett appeared on CNBC's Squawk Box this morning. CNBC's Becky Quick asked about the current budget fiasco we are all witnessing in the Washington. Buffett characterized it as "idiocy." He said that using the debt ceiling as a budget bargaining chip basically turns it into a "political weapon of mass destruction" pointed at the American people. "You don't use poisoned gas and say "people won't die until next Saturday,"" he said. In terms of a potential default and the prospect of the U.S. dollar losing its status as the global reserve currency, Buffett warned that it would produce chaos over time. "If this goes past tomorrow, we will definitely see something," he added.
REUTERS/Jonathan ErnstPhotographers take pictures of U.S. House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) (R) as he appears before reporters after a Republican caucus meeting at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, October 15, 2013.WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate prepared for a last ditch effort Wednesday to avoid a historic lapse in the government's borrowing authority, a breach that President Barack Obama has said could lead to default and deliver a damaging blow to the global economy. After a day of stop-and-go negotiations, the top Democrat and Republican in the U.S. Senate were said to be close to agreeing on a proposal to raise the debt limit - and reopen the partially shuttered government - for consideration by the full Senate on Wednesday. The measure's fate remained uncertain in the fractured Republican-controlled House of Representatives, which failed twice Tuesday to produce its own plan. The Senate was scheduled to meet at noon (1600 GMT) on Wednesday, and the House at 10:00 a.m. (1400 GMT). With borrowing authority set to run out on Thursday, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Republican leader Senator Mitch McConnell "are very close" to an agreement, Representative Chris Van Hollen, a top House Democrat, told MSNBC late Tuesday night.  "This is now back on track," Democratic Senator Heidi Heitkamp told CNN late on Tuesday, after a day of chaotic developments that frayed the nerves of many members of Congress and global financial markets. McConnell and Reid resumed stalled talks after a roller coaster day that saw two separate legislative efforts in the House buried after it became apparent too many Republicans were rebelling against their leaders' plans. Following weeks of bitter fighting among Democrats and Republicans, the layoff of hundreds of thousands of federal workers and turmoil for stock markets, the deal under discussion - if eventually enacted - would basically give President Barack Obama what he has demanded for months: A straight-forward debt limit hike and government funding bill. The deal would extend U.S. borrowing authority until February 7, although the Treasury Department would have tools to temporarily extend its borrowing capacity beyond that date if Congress failed to act early next year. With the final details not yet nailed down, as it stood Tuesday night, the agreement envisioned funding government agencies until January 15, ending a partial government shutdown that began with the new fiscal year on October 1. Asian stock markets were listless in early trading on Wednesday as they waited to see if Washington was closing in on a deal to resolve the debt crisis. Stocks showed little change and remained near a five-month peak. SENATE HURDLES Senate aides said the two leaders are looking at two possible ways of speeding the legislation through the chamber, which often can bog down for days with procedural hurdles. Senator Dick Durbin, the second-ranking Senate Democrat, told reporters: "In order to move this quickly tomorrow or as soon thereafter as possible, we need cooperation of members. If they want to drag their feet, use every objection they can, this could take a few days." Under one scenario, all 100 senators would agree to let Democrats schedule quick votes to pass the bill. That would mean that Tea Party firebrands, such as Republican Senator Ted Cruz, would give up their rights to delay a vote. Cruz has not publicly announced his intentions but some Senate aides think that the Texas freshman with presidential aspirations has been sending positive signals in recent days. Cruz and fellow Tea Party activists late last month delayed passage of a government funding bill as they demanded major changes to Obama's landmark healthcare law. The deadlock led to federal agency shutdowns as Obama and his fellow Democrats stood firm against changing the law. The other scenario would have the House send a formal "message" to the Senate to pave the way for quick Senate action, according to a Senate aide who asked not to be identified. Again, it was not clear whether House Republicans would go along with that option. BOEHNER'S TOUGH DECISION Assuming the Senate succeeds, House Speaker John Boehner will have to decide whether to allow passage of a bill that many of his fellow Republicans might oppose, a decision that could impact the top Republican's political future. Uncertainty over Washington's ability to avert a default led Fitch Ratings to warn it could cut the sovereign credit rating of the United States from AAA, citing the political brinkmanship over raising the federal debt ceiling. House Republicans twice tried to come up with a new compromise but failed to satisfy Obama, Senate Democrats or Tea Party conservatives who are determined to win changes to the president's signature healthcare law before they will agree to concessions on the budget. The first House Republican attempt was shot down in a closed-door meeting that had begun with members singing the hymn "Amazing Grace." The second plan was scuttled hours before it was expected to hit the House floor for a vote after the influential Heritage Action for America, a conservative group, urged a "no" vote because it did not do enough to stop Obama's healthcare law. If Congress fails to reach a deal by Thursday, checks would likely go out on time for a short while for everyone from bondholders to workers who are owed unemployment benefits. But analysts warn that a default on government obligations could quickly follow, potentially causing the U.S. financial sector to freeze up and threatening the global economy. The U.S. Treasury Department seized on Fitch's downgrade threat to press Congress. "The announcement reflects the urgency with which Congress should act to remove the threat of default hanging over the economy," a Treasury spokesperson said. After the Fitch announcement, S&amp;P 500 futures fell 9.6 points while Dow Jones industrial average futures sank 60 points and Nasdaq 100 futures fell 7.5 points. Numerous polls show Republicans have taken a hit in public opinion since the standoff began and the government partially closed. A Washington Post/ABC News poll released on Monday found that 74 percent of Americans disapprove of the way congressional Republicans have handled the standoff, compared with a 53 percent disapproval rating for Obama. Another survey released by Gallup on Tuesday showed American confidence in the U.S. economy fell another five points last week as the government shutdown continued. The crisis is the latest in a series of budget battles in recent years that have hurt consumer confidence and weighed on the economy. A Monday estimate by the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, a think tank, said the uncertainty caused by the frequent fiscal showdowns had boosted the unemployment rate by 0.6 of a percentage point, or the equivalent of 900,000 jobs since late 2009.

REUTERS/Adrees LatifApple iPhone 5c phones are pictured at the Apple retail store on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, New York, September 20, 2013. TAIPEI/BEIJING (Reuters) - Apple Inc has told manufacturers of its new iPhone 5C that it will cut orders of the smartphone for the final three months of the year, a source familiar with the supply chain situation said. Pegatron Corp, a major manufacturer of Apple's new phone, had iPhone 5C orders reduced by less than 20 percent, the source told Reuters on Wednesday. Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, Apple's other manufacturer of the iPhone 5C, has had its orders for the same period reduced by a third, the Wall Street Journal reported. The 5C is a slightly cheaper alternative to the premium 5S model. Pegatron and Hon Hai declined to comment, while Apple could not be immediately reached for comment.

REUTERS/Jessica RinaldiDr. Marc Faber, publisher of investment newsletter "The Gloom Boom & Doom" speaks at the 16th annual Sohn Investment Conference in New York May 25, 2011.Famed investor Marc Faber believes that Apple is a troubled company making an array of frivolous productsâ€”and for that reason could be on the road to bankruptcy. "This is the kind of stock I'm really not interested in," Faber said about Apple on Tuesday's "Futures Now." "I'm not saying it will go bust," but "it could go bust eventually." (Read more: It's officialâ€”Apple event set for Oct. 22) Faber added that it won't go under "tomorrow" or "the day after tomorrow." But the editor and publisher of the Gloom, Boom &amp; Doom Report compares Apple to another technology company that's now infamous for moving slower than the times. "This is kind of like Polaroid of the 1970s," Faber said. After all, Polaroid, like Apple, was founded and driven by a famous innovator who eventually left the company. "Dr. [Edwin] Land, who was the founder of Polaroid, had more patents under his head than anyone else in the world," Faber noted. In 1982, Land (who received more patents than any other American save Thomas Edison) left his seat on Polaroid's board, and gave up his research post at the company. In 2001, Polaroid filed for bankruptcy protection, and proceeded to sell off its businesses. (Read more: Apple snags Burberry CEO as new retail chief) Apple certainly looks strong on a fundamental basis. The company has $43 billion in cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet. Apple took in $35 billion worth of revenue in the second-quarter alone, and on Tuesday, the company was worth more than $450 billion. But Faber maintains that the tech industry is littered with the graves of former market leaders. "We have many other examples of high-tech companies that just faded away," Faber noted. And for Faber, Apple's biggest problem may be that its products aren't exactly human necessities. "It's basically a toy company for grown-ups," Faber said. â€”By CNBC's Alex Rosenberg.

UK labor statistics are out and they're encouraging for the region. The unemployment rate for the period from June to August was 7.7%, which was in line with economists' forecasts. However, those filing for unemployment claims in September plunged by 41,700, this was a sharper decline than the 25,000 expected. According to Bloomberg, this is the biggest drop since June 1997. Here's a look at how the British pound spiked against the dollar after the news. Bloomberg.com
Werner Kunz / FlickrMarkets are up slightly in Europe. Britain's FTSE is down 0.2%. France's CAC 40 is is down 0.5%. Germany's DAX is flat. Italy's FTSE MIB is is up 0.5% Spain's IBEX is flat. Japan's Nikkei closed up 0.1%. Meanwhile U.S. futures are pointing modestly higher with Dow futures up by over 50 points. All of this comes after Fitch's downgrade of the U.S. credit outlook as the October 17 debt ceiling nears. On Tuesday night, Congress scrambled to cobble together a workable deal to delay the debt ceiling and reopen the government.Â  At this point, it seems that an agreement is within reach. Even if we miss the October 17 debt ceiling, it won't be the end of the world. Many economists have repeatedly warned that any default would come at the end of the month at the earliest. To clarify, the debt ceiling is when the U.S. Treasury will no longer have the authority to borrow money by issuing bonds. However, it will still have around $30 billion in cash to continue financing its obligation.Â  It's only after that cash runs out that we have to start worrying. This understanding may explain why the markets continue to be so calm.
REUTERS/ Pascal LauenerGoldman Sachs Chairman and CEO Lloyd BlankfeinGoldman Sachs has beefed up its online career center recently with a mobile app, a new Twitter feed and, just launched last night, a series of live virtual information sessions aimed at students who may be interested in joining the firm. We signed up for the first of 15 webinars â€“ a general overview of the firmÂ hosted by Chris Hussey, a member of the firmâ€™s research management team â€“ to see what theyâ€™re like. Buried beneath the clichÃ©s common to all recruitment videos were a few interesting nuggets, some more obvious than others. Back Office Wins: Only 42% of the Goldman employees work in client-facing roles: investment banking, securities, investment management, global investment research and merchant banking. The other 58% work in what Goldman calls its â€œfederation divisionâ€ â€“ back office employees like compliance officers and tech specialists. Finance Degree Not a Must: Yes, itâ€™s a disadvantage to have not studied finance in college, says Hussey, as you donâ€™t yet speak the language, but having a non-finance degree will not rule you out. Hussey himself was a medieval history major. â€œYou will have to do more convincing, but Iâ€™m living proof you can do it,â€ he said. Heâ€™s not lying. Liberal arts are the second biggest cohort of Goldman employees, behind finance graduates. The Hours are Long, Duh: Hussey answered a question I submitted online: What kind of hours do you put in? He typically shows up at the office between 5:30 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. Heâ€™s in the office for around 12 hours, then logs in from home and puts in another hour or two before calling it a day. He said he averages between five and six hours of sleep. â€œWork-life balance isnâ€™t about how many hours you work, but how much you enjoy the work,â€ he said. They Dig the â€œGovâ€™t Sachsâ€ Nickname: Or at least Hussey does. Goldman earned the nickname for the number of alumni who have taken government positions after leaving the firm, most notably former U.S. Treasury Secretaries Hank Paulson and Robert Rubin. Some have used the nickname in a derogatory fashion, using it as an example of Goldmanâ€™s close ties to Washington, but Hussey said itâ€™s all about giving back. â€œIâ€™m proud of that,â€ he said. Everyone Volunteers: Every employee is required to take one day off each year to work at a charitable organization. You can choose your own charity or ask to be assigned one. Ice, Ice Baby: Goldman is one of the biggest ice makers in New York City, at least according to Hussey. The Wall Street building holds ice-making tanks in its basement that are used in the summers. Water is frozen at night, when electricity is the cheapest, and melted during the day for cooling purposes. Culture Wins: Hussey was asked who Goldmanâ€™s rivals were and why the firm may have an advantage over such competitors. He listed the usual â€“ J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, Citi, HSBC, Wells Fargo and others â€“ and said, while admitting obvious bias, that Goldmanâ€™s collaborative culture helps it stand apart.
