REUTERS/Lee Jae-WonAn investor looks at a board showing the stock price index at a brokerage firm in Seoul October 16, 2008. Seoul shares fell more than 9 percent that day, posting its biggest daily percentage loss in seven years, as the grim world economic outlook and the overnight Wall Street crash made investors dump shares across the board. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) officially ended down 9.44 percent at 1,213.78 points, its lowest close since mid-June 2006. On Wednesday, South Korea lifted a ban on short selling of financials stocks enacted during the global financial crisis in October 2008. Early in Thursday trading, the Korean KOSPI is up 0.6%, and the only big losers are Daewoo Securities (down 6.6%) and Woori Investment &amp; Securities (down 5.2%). "The Korean government imposed this ban in 2008 during the Global Financial Crisis," says Bryan Song, a research analyst at BofA Merrill Lynch. "Originally, Korea forbade short trades for all stocks in Oct 2008 to arrest a slump in equities triggered by the worldwide credit freeze. It subsequently lifted the ban on non-financial stocks in Jun 2009, but kept restrictions on financials ‚Äì banks, brokerages, other financial firms ‚Äì as they were presumed to be vulnerable to the still weak and volatile global financial market conditions." Why now? "This action shows that: (1) the government is less concerned about the impact from external elements (i.e., QE tapering); (2) Korean financial companies may be deemed to be in relatively good shape; and (3) the regulatory direction could be less burdensome," says Morgan Stanley analyst Joon Seok. Seok and Song both agree that the lifting of the ban shouldn't have much of an effect on share prices beyond the very short term. JPMorgan analyst Scott YH Seo believes the lifting of the ban is positive for financials in the long run. "From an industry perspective, the removal should further help the development of financial products (e.g., introduction of more sophisticated ETF products), as well as the local hedge fund industry," says Seo. "Considering the above, the overall implications for Korea financials should be short-term neutral but mid/long-term positive in our view."
Sotheby'sAn Andy Warhol work titled "Silver Car Crash (Double Disaster)" sold for a record $105.4 million at a Sotheby's auction in New York City this evening. The sale was a record high price for the artist. The painting had been expected to sell for between $60 and $80 million. According to the AP: A prized 1963 Andy Warhol painting that captures the immediate aftermath of a car crash sold for $105 million Wednesday at a New York City auction, setting a record for the famed pop artist, Sotheby‚Äôs said. The 8- by 13-foot painting titled ‚ÄúSilver Car Crash (Double Disaster)‚Äù depicts a twisted body sprawled across a car‚Äôs mangled interior. It has only been seen once in public in the past 26 years. The buyer wasn‚Äôt immediately identified. The previous record for a Warhol work was set in 2007 when ‚ÄúGreen Car Crash (Green Burning Car I)‚Äù sold for $71.7 million, according to the AP. The sale came just a day after a triptych by Francis Bacon sold for $142 million at Christie's, becoming the most expensive work of art ever sold at auction.
Facebook CFO David Ebersman has $42.6 million more in cash to his name right now. He sold 911,700 shares of Facebook stock on Tuesday, the third largest trade by a Facebook insider in about three months. The trade was pre-scheduled, so it doesn't reflect on Facebook's business. It just shows off the kind of wealth Facebook has created for some of its employees as the stock trades above $45. He still holds 650,962 share in his name, and just shifted 1.4 million more into trust for his family, according to SEC documents. But that wasn't the biggest cash-out this month. Facebook board member and investor Marc Andreessen sold 1.2 million shares when the stock reached above $49 on November 6 for $59.5 million. You have to go back to August 7 to find a bigger payday. That's when Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg sold about 2.4 million shares at $38+ for $91.3 million, also as a scheduled transaction. She's had a few other transactions since then, including selling $8.3 million worth of stock in September. Those 1,600 Twitter employees have to be watching this sort of thing and biting their nails. They need to get through their lock-up period, when they are free to sell their Twitter stock, before they can turn their stock into cash.
Harvard students get near-perfect SAT scores. These are smart, smart kids. So they shouldn't have trouble with a simple logic question, right? Try the following puzzle: A bat and ball cost $1.10. The bat costs one dollar more than the ball. How much does the ball cost? Scroll down for the answer ... theseanster93 via www.flickr.com Creative CommonsYou probably answered 10¬¢. That's what most Harvard students answered.  But the real answer is 5¬¢. Behavioral economist Daniel Kahneman explains why most people get this wrong: A number came to your mind. The number, of course, is 10: 10¬¢. The distinctive mark of this easy puzzle is that it evokes an answer that is intuitive, appealing, and wrong. Do the math, and you will see. If the ball costs 10¬¢, then the total cost will be $1.20 (10¬¢ for the ball and $1.10 for the bat), not $1.10. The correct answer is 5¬¢. It is safe to assume that the intuitive answer also came to the mind of those who ended up with the correct number‚Äîthey somehow managed to resist the intuition. Many thousands of university students have answered the bat-and-ball puzzle, and the results are shocking. More than 50% of students at Harvard, MIT, and Princeton gave the intuitive‚Äîincorrect‚Äîanswer. At less selective universities, the rate of demonstrable failure to check was in excess of 80%. The bat-and-ball problem is our first encounter with an observation that will be a recurrent theme of this book: many people are overconfident, prone to place too much faith in their intuitions. They apparently find cognitive effort at least mildly unpleasant and avoid it as much as possible. This excerpt comes from Kahneman's 2011 book, "Thinking, Fast And Slow," which posits that we have an intuitive mental system and a logical mental system, and we often use the wrong one at the wrong time.

Screenshot from ABC's "Shark Tank"Mark Cuban has had to sit through a lot of terrible pitches on reality business show "Shark Tank." But the one thing he can't stand is when aspiring entrepreneurs waste his time rattling off insignificant details about how their businesses got started.† "The worst thing you can do is give a long backstory," the billionaire investor†recently told Business Insider.†"It's not the time to talk about your struggles and hard work.†Every entrepreneur has a similar story. You have to get right into the meat of the business."† Meanwhile, the best way to get Cuban's attention is to "have a real, operating company that has started to get real traction in a new industry that has a ton of upside,"†he said.† Take for example the Amini brothers' pitch this season on their†mobile health app Rolodoc, which Cuban called the worst pitch in the history of the show. The two doctors spent a lot of time winding up about the medical profession and why they wanted to bring health practitioners a social network. But when it got down to it, they couldn't explain the business model, how they would market the product, or even how the customer would use it. According to Cuban,†"They had no company. No business. No clue." Compare that to Michael Tseng's Plate Topper†presentation in season four, Cuban's all-time favorite pitch. Tseng immediately launched into the QVC and Walmart.com sales of his food-savor invention, sparking the investors' attention. Then he was able to answer questions confidently†and eventually to negotiate a deal. The moral of the story? When pitching your business to investors, particularly to Cuban, stick to what they really care about: why your business is a smart investment.

Some Advisors Are Turning Back To The 40/60 Model (Investment News)  Many advisors are sticking with the traditional 60% stocks and 40% bonds formula. These advisors argue that some of their counterparts are over-diversifying at a time when they worry about a poor returns from bonds, and a stock market correction, reports Megan Durisin of Investment News.¬† "Everyone is looking for the silver bullet. Everyone is looking for returns without risk. From a performance standpoint, it hasn't been good for people to chase those returns," James Osborne, president of Bason Asset Management, told Investment News. John Osterweis, chairman and CIO of Osterweis Capital Management said, "60/40's been beating the geniuses ... I just have a feeling that the pendulum may be ready to swing back." FINRA Chief Thinks Investors Aren't Aware Of The Impact Of Bond Volatility On Their Portfolios (The Wall Street Journal) Investors aren't quite cognizant of the impact that significant volatility in bonds can have on their portfolios, the Wall Street Journal cited Richard Ketchum, CEO of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), as ¬†saying.

YouTubeWhen Donald Trump sold his sprawling Palm Beach, Fla., mansion for a whopping $95 million five years ago, the true identity of the buyer was a mystery. That is no longer the case, as Russian billionaire Dmitri Rybolovlev has finally acknowledged his involvement in the purchase of the 515 North County Road home. Rybolovlev told lawyers during a London deposition last month that he invested an undisclosed amount in the 2008 transaction, Palm Beach Post reported. The billionaire said he continues to pay property taxes and cover maintenance costs at the mansion but denied that he is the true owner. Attorneys for Rybolovlevís estranged wife, Elena, pressed him for details during the deposition. Elena has sued Rybolovlev in Palm Beach Circuit Court in an attempt to receive half of the mansionís value through a divorce. Rybolovlev amassed his wealth through the potash fertilizer industry. The 33,000-square-foot oceanfront mansion used to be known in the town as the Gosman estate.†[Palm Beach Post]†ó Eric Kalis

Harrison JacobsThe Bushwick Collective has brought attractive street art to neighborhood buildings.As the rents in Williamsburg, Brooklyn have skyrocketed, young professionals have been begun to retreat deeper along the L train to Bushwick. For better or worse, the result has been rapid gentrification. From 2000 to 2010, the number of white residents in North Bushwick has nearly doubled and the number of Asian residents has increased nearly fivefold. Just in the last two years, the average rent for a studio has increased 27 percent. The serious crime rate has dropped from 36% in 2000 to 24.4% as of 2011. Now everywhere you look there are juice bars, organic markets, craft beer stores, bike shops, and more things that hipsters love. Best of all, the rents are still relatively cheap.
Flickr / Tom RafteryJanet Yellen just released her testimony ahead of her confirmation hearings tomorrow. Gold and stocks are spiking on the news. The Dollar is slipping. So did she say anything super dovish? Far from it. She literally made new real news at all. It's all throat clearing for tomorrow's Q&amp;A, which will hopefully be interesting. So what explains the market move. Here's the only explanation: People were expecting that she might throw a bone to the hawks ó that she might talk up her concern about not letting inflation go wild. But she didn't. And she's smart to. In a world where forward guidance is the dominant force in monetary policy, every word she says arguably matters. And beyond that her confirmation is in the bag. No need to pander. That's the only explanation that makes sense.

Thinkorswim Janet Yellen goes before the Senate Banking Committee tomorrow at 10 AM ET as the first step in the process to confirm her to replace Ben Bernanke as the next chair of the Federal Reserve. The Fed just posted the full text of her prepared remarks on its website, and gold and Treasuries are heading higher. The charts above show the move (gold futures on the left and 10-year Treasury futures on the right). Market participants seem to be honing in on the three paragraphs below, which may or may not include clues about the future path of quantitative easing: Today the economy is significantly stronger and continues to improve. The private sector has created 7.8 million jobs since the post-crisis low for employment in 2010. Housing, which was at the center of the crisis, seems to have turned a corner--construction, home prices, and sales are up significantly. The auto industry has made an impressive comeback, with domestic production and sales back to near their pre-crisis levels. We have made good progress, but we have farther to go to regain the ground lost in the crisis and the recession. Unemployment is down from a peak of 10 percent, but at 7.3 percent in October, it is still too high, reflecting a labor market and economy performing far short of their potential. At the same time, inflation has been running below the Federal Reserve's goal of 2 percent and is expected to continue to do so for some time. For these reasons, the Federal Reserve is using its monetary policy tools to promote a more robust recovery. A strong recovery will ultimately enable the Fed to reduce its monetary accommodation and reliance on unconventional policy tools such as asset purchases. I believe that supporting the recovery today is the surest path to returning to a more normal approach to monetary policy. Click here to read the full text of Yellen's remarks ª

REUTERS/Jonathan ErnstU.S. Federal Reserve Vice Chair Janet Yellen, President Barack Obama's nominee to succeed Ben Bernanke as chairman, arrives to meet with Senator Charles Schumer (D-NY) in his office on Capitol Hill in Washington, November 7, 2013. The Senate Banking Committee said on Thursday that it will hold a hearing on November 14 on the nomination of Federal Reserve Vice Chair Yellen to take the helm of the central bank when Ben Bernanke steps down at the end of January. The Federal Reserve has just posted Fed chair nominee Janet Yellen's prepared remarks for Thursday's Senate Banking Committee confirmation hearing on its website. In the speech, Yellen said the U.S. economy continues to improve and that the housing market seems to have turned a corner, but the economy must improve further before the Fed lessens stimulus. 10-year U.S. Treasury futures have received a lift from the release and are now up 0.5% on the day. Below is the full text (emphasis added to highlight key paragraphs). Chairman Johnson, Senator Crapo, and members of the Committee, thank you for this opportunity to appear before you today. It has been a privilege for me to serve the Federal Reserve at different times and in different roles over the past 36 years, and an honor to be nominated by the President to lead the Fed as Chair of the Board of Governors. I approach this task with a clear understanding that the Congress has entrusted the Federal Reserve with great responsibilities. Its decisions affect the well-being of every American and the strength and prosperity of our nation. That prosperity depends most, of course, on the productiveness and enterprise of the American people, but the Federal Reserve plays a role too, promoting conditions that foster maximum employment, low and stable inflation, and a safe and sound financial system. The past six years have been challenging for our nation and difficult for many Americans. We endured the worst financial crisis and deepest recession since the Great Depression. The effects were severe, but they could have been far worse. Working together, government leaders confronted these challenges and successfully contained the crisis. Under the wise and skillful leadership of Chairman Bernanke, the Fed helped stabilize the financial system, arrest the steep fall in the economy, and restart growth. Today the economy is significantly stronger and continues to improve. The private sector has created 7.8 million jobs since the post-crisis low for employment in 2010. Housing, which was at the center of the crisis, seems to have turned a corner--construction, home prices, and sales are up significantly. The auto industry has made an impressive comeback, with domestic production and sales back to near their pre-crisis levels. We have made good progress, but we have farther to go to regain the ground lost in the crisis and the recession. Unemployment is down from a peak of 10 percent, but at 7.3 percent in October, it is still too high, reflecting a labor market and economy performing far short of their potential. At the same time, inflation has been running below the Federal Reserve's goal of 2 percent and is expected to continue to do so for some time. For these reasons, the Federal Reserve is using its monetary policy tools to promote a more robust recovery. A strong recovery will ultimately enable the Fed to reduce its monetary accommodation and reliance on unconventional policy tools such as asset purchases. I believe that supporting the recovery today is the surest path to returning to a more normal approach to monetary policy. In the past two decades, and especially under Chairman Bernanke, the Federal Reserve has provided more and clearer information about its goals. Like the Chairman, I strongly believe that monetary policy is most effective when the public understands what the Fed is trying to do and how it plans to do it. At the request of Chairman Bernanke, I led the effort to adopt a statement of the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) longer-run objectives, including a 2 percent goal for inflation. I believe this statement has sent a clear and powerful message about the FOMC's commitment to its goals and has helped anchor the public's expectations that inflation will remain low and stable in the future. In this and many other ways, the Federal Reserve has become a more open and transparent institution. I have strongly supported this commitment to openness and transparency, and will continue to do so if I am confirmed and serve as Chair. The crisis revealed weaknesses in our financial system. I believe that financial institutions, the Federal Reserve, and our fellow regulators have made considerable progress in addressing those weaknesses. Banks are stronger today, regulatory gaps are being closed, and the financial system is more stable and more resilient. Safeguarding the United States in a global financial system requires higher standards both here and abroad, so the Federal Reserve and other regulators have worked with our counterparts around the globe to secure improved capital requirements and other reforms internationally. Today, banks hold more and higher-quality capital and liquid assets that leave them much better prepared to withstand financial turmoil. Large banks are now subject to annual "stress tests" designed to ensure that they will have enough capital to continue the vital role they play in the economy, even under highly adverse circumstances. We have made progress in promoting a strong and stable financial system, but here, too, important work lies ahead. I am committed to using the Fed's supervisory and regulatory role to reduce the threat of another financial crisis. I believe that capital and liquidity rules and strong supervision are important tools for addressing the problem of financial institutions that are regarded as "too big to fail." In writing new rules, however, the Fed should continue to limit the regulatory burden for community banks and smaller institutions, taking into account their distinct role and contributions. Overall, the Federal Reserve has sharpened its focus on financial stability and is taking that goal into consideration when carrying out its responsibilities for monetary policy. I support these developments and pledge, if confirmed, to continue them. Our country has come a long way since the dark days of the financial crisis, but we have farther to go. Likewise, I believe the Federal Reserve has made significant progress toward its goals but has more work to do. Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today. I would be happy to respond to your questions.

Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, famous for rattling legal sabers against Facebook, garnered some attention when they claimed to own 1% of all Bitcoins, the anonymous digital currency, earlier this year. Speaking to Business Insider's executive editor Joe Weisenthal at IGNITION 2013, the twins laid out the reasons why they love Bitcoin. In response to the criticism that Bitcoin is purely speculative, either Cameron or Tyler (we didn't catch which one) said that "people speculate in dollars too. This idea that people aren't betting when they hang on to a dollar is incorrect." They also love the currency's transparency, explaining that "there is†nothing predictable or transparent about the US dollar. No one has any idea what the Federal Reserve's going to do, how they operate." Bitcoin, on the other hand, is fixed at 21 million coins that will come out incrementally and predictably over time. "Bitcoin brings the promise of email to the finance sector. Now it's instant and effectively free to send money anywhere," the twins said.

Sotheby'sThe Pink Star, the world's largest cut diamond of its class, sold at Sotheby's evening auction in Geneva for a record $82 million, Sky News reports. That's well above the estimated $60 million sale price, and includes Sotheby's commission, according to AFP. The 59.6-carat diamond was expected to command a record price, both because of its size and color. It is the largest internally flawless or flawless, fancy vivid pink diamond that the Gemological Institute of American (GIA) has ever graded, according to Sotheby's. As for its uniquely vivid hue,¬†The Telegraph explained: "The 'Pink Star' gets its intense pink colour due to changes to the electron structure, known as 'plastic deformation' during its journey to the earth's surface." The previous record price for a diamond was $46.2 million. That diamond, also a pink stone, was purchased by London jeweler Lawrence Graff at a 2010 Sotheby's auction. Here's another look at the Pink Star. The identity of the buyer remains under wraps. Sotheby's
The 59.6 carat "Pink Star" diamond ó the world's largest cut diamond ó went up for auction in Switzerland today, and it sold for a whopping 68 million Swiss francs. That's around $82 million. Diamond prices don't get the same amount of coverage as gold, silver, and other metals and minerals that are used in jewelry. For those who are interested, diamond demand in general has been disappointing this year. The pricing for rough, unpolished diamonds have been getting hit further by supply-side problems. It's "tough times for now in rough diamonds," writes RBC Capital Markets analyst Des Kilalea. "Lower prices in some categories of rough will, we believe, be driven, in part, by tight liquidity in cutting centres and thin margins on some goods in polishing. Our view is that rough will not show any meaningful recovery until liquidity returns to the cutting centres and bank debt comes under control." On the demand side, people are still buying, but not as much as expected. "On retail demand, the picture is not particularly worrying as polished is moving, albeit not as quickly as hoped due to slower demand in India and some competition in the jewellery market from gold in China and India, though Diwali gold jewellery sales are somewhat disappointing, retailers say. The result is that polished prices are relatively volatile but prices have remained steady. According to PolishedPrices.com (PP), the PP polished index is up 3.7% year to date with October up 0.7% on September." RBC Capital

Fab, the online fashion and design retail site that is undergoing a wrenching change in its business strategy, will lay off 50 more people according to AllThingsD. The company gave Business Insider this statement: We haven't announced any layoffs. It is accurate that Fab is undergoing management changes as we realign the business to execute on our 2014-2017 plan. There will be a number of management changes involved as we streamline the organization and move to a category P&amp;L based structure. As not all of the organizational changes are final yet, we are withholding comment on any specific individuals until later this week. Little of the news coming out of Fab these days is good. The company, which once had around 700 employees, now has about 390 by our count. Here's the one piece of good news sustaining the company right now: Earlier this year, it raised $165 million in new investment this year alone, for a total of $336 million in all venture funding. So the company is not imminently going out of business. But that money came as the company changed strategy, from a "flash sales" daily deal model to a more traditional online retail model. That change has been accompanied by these less than upbeat moves: Fab was at one time valued at $1 billion. We'd love to hear from anyone who knows whether these moves will leave the company poised to meet that estimation ‚Äî or otherwise.
REUTERS/Mike BlakeMany have argued that the U.S. housing recovery has been driven by investors, not traditional homebuyers. After the housing bust, investors stepped in and over time absorbed inventory that helped drive up home prices. But investors have also been accused of crowding out traditional homebuyers. More recently, rising mortgage rates have helped keep potential homebuyers out of the market. In a new report titled "US Housing: The price is becoming right," Societe Generale's Aneta Markowska writes that homebuyers have been sidelined largely due to price expectations, which she said are improving. "Price expectations are a fundamental driver of housing demand, and homebuyers simply extrapolate from recent performance," writes Societe Generale's Aneta Markowska in a new report. Naturally, homebuyers didn't want to buy what they saw as a "depreciating asset." Markowska points out that home price expectations are finally looking up. "We found that price expectations can be approximated by a simple six-quarter moving average of realized gains, lagged by one quarter. Measured this way, expectations crossed over to positive territory earlier this year, and are now approaching 5%." As long as mortgage rates rise in the context of rising home price expectations, they won't destabilize housing demand. Markowska argues that real mortgage rates are falling. Her assumption is that real mortgage rates will reach pre-crisis low levels of -4.7% in Q2 and Q3 2014. In that context, she sees a handover from investors to traditional homebuyers in the final stage of healing in the housing market. "To a deflationary dynamic? Our analysis suggests otherwise. If home price inflation is in fact sticky and if households do extrapolate from past price movements, then the positive momentum should continue. In this context, the heavy investor buying that occurred over the past 12 months should be viewed as a positive development. After all, it contributed to speedy inventory normalization and to the much-needed reversal of deflation in housing. In turn, those recent price gains should be changing perceptions about future price appreciation, and attracting would-be buyers back to the market. "Lending standards should also ease gradually on the back of changing price perceptions and indeed early evidence suggests that some easing is already taking place. This is how we envision the handoff to traditional home buyers, which should mark the last and final stage of the healing process in housing." Markowska thinks the conditions are already in place and the "price expectations have been transformed from deflationary to inflationary," she told Business Insider in an email.¬† "Now we need to see confirmation that the handoff from investor-driven market to homebuyer-driven market is in fact happening. I would expect this confirmation within the next 6 months," she said. Here is Societe Generale's projection of real mortgage rates and housing demand: Societe Generale
CurbedNYA model of the Apthorp with the proposed penthouse addition.The new owners of Upper West Side landmark the Apthorp have been trying for some time to convince the City to allow them to build a four penthouse addition on top of the existing building. If last night‚Äôs public hearing at the Landmarks Preservation Commission is any indication, it looks like Area Property Partners will not be getting their wish, reports Hana R. Alberts at Curbed. Shortly after Area Property Partners made their pitch last night, a line of local officials, preservationists, building residents, and neighbors took turns criticizing the project. Most of the concern is that, despite the fact that the addition is hardly seen from the street, it would block light, destroy the design of the building‚Äôs courtyard, and require the altering of the open pergolas that many residents and community members feel is essential to the building‚Äôs design.¬† The new owners maintain that the new revenue from the addition is essential to performing necessary maintenance and preservation of the building.¬† While a similar protest occurred in September, last night there were also written statements opposing the project from four famous architects‚ÄîRobert A.M. Stern, A. Eugene Kohn (of Kohn Pedersen Fox), Michael Graves, and David Childs (who designed 1WTC).¬† From David Childs: The Apthorpe is perhaps the best known exmaple of the turn of the century, full block apartment buildings in Manhattan, and is appropriately a treasured landmark. This proposal would dodamage to the design and set an unwanted precedent for similar cases in the future. From Michael Graves: The current proposal to connect [the existing penthouses] by a third larger volume is inappropriate and, in fact, damaging to the appearance of the building and its design intent. Residents of the building have been equally harsh on the proposed addition.¬† "It's an eyesore and an affront to the seminal design of the building,‚Äù one resident since 1974 said during a community board meeting in late September.¬† Another long-time resident was even more cutting: "The structure on the top just looks like a Holiday Inn plopped on the roof‚Ä¶‚Äù Below, you can see the current top of the building and the proposed add-on: CurbedNY
Google FinanceWe've heard that headline a lot recently, but it doesn't get old. The S&amp;P 500 just passed 1,775.22, an intraday high hit on October 30. There isn't a whole lot of market-moving news today. On Thursday, Federal Reserve Vice Chair meets testifies before the Senate Banking Committee to begin her confirmation process to become Fed Chair. "For the markets, the focus will be on any signal that Yellen will lean toward an early tapering of Fed easing," said Wells Fargo's John Silvia. "What are her benchmarks for policy action? How about altering the unemployment rate target as reflected in the IMF papers cited this week in the press?"
This morning the New York Post published its list of Top 5 Old School NYC Steakhouses, and frankly, that can't be the end of it. It just can't be. Here's their list: Now here's what's wrong with it. (I'm going to try to have a rational debate about something as deeply sensory and emotional as steak, so stay with me here.) First thing first ó BLT Steak is a great steakhouse ó love the whole BLT empire. But that restaurant opened in 2004. If it were a human being it would not be able to drive, vote, or consume alcohol. It would not have even hit puberty. It should not be on the same "old school" list as Keens Steakhouse, which has been around this town in one form or another since 1885 (1885!!!), or Peter Luger, which has been in the same family since the 1950s.  Jody Storch, the current owner/manager/Brooklyn Commissioner of Steak, got the restaurant from her father. He worked in the factory across the street, and when he heard the restaurant was being sold by the previous owner, he bought it. And speaking of family, there is a glaring omission on this list ó Old Homestead Steakhouse.  I, personally, will stand for Old Homestead on a soap box until the cows come home (and we put them on a grill). Not only was the restaurant around in 1868 as the Tidewater Trading Post, it was called that because at that time, the Hudson river crawled right up to the restaurant.† Old Homestead as we know it now was bought by Harry Sherry in the 1940s, and his grandsons Greg and Marc, have built it into a great brand with locations in Atlantic City and Las Vegas as well as NYC. And what's more ó what's actually epic ó is that Marc and Greg worked tirelessly with the Japanese government in the 1990s to bring Kobe beef to you and me, and all the other until-then-deprived Americans who need it. They worked with regulators to get Japanese farms up to American health code specifications. This is diplomacy on at LEAST John Kerry's level. At least. When you go to Old Homestead, you are Marc and Greg's guest. That much is obvious, and that is the heart and soul of a steakhouse. That brings us to another glaring omission here. Gallagher's ó a steakhouse that lets customers choose their own cuts. It almost closed last year and grown bankers actually wept in the streets of New York (not really, but we got a bunch of super sad mail about it). Anyway, listen. Be careful with your steakhouse lists. People care about this stuff. You have to spend a lot of time eating a lot of steaks and drinking a lot of martinis to get this delicate stuff right. It's work, people. Hard work.
Business Insider/Matthew Boesler, data from BloombergApple has been something of a disappointment for investors over the past year or so. Shares of the consumer tech giant peaked at $700 on September 21, 2012 ‚Äî the day the highly-anticipated iPhone 5 went on sale in retail stores. The stock bottomed out in April and has been rallying since June. Still, at today's prices around $521, shares are more than 25% below the September 2012 high. In a note to clients, Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale strategists led by Vivek Misra devise a trading strategy using Apple's Asia-based suppliers that has fared much better than actual Apple shares since the launch of the iPhone 5. Datastream, SG Cross Asset Research/EquityPerformance rebased to 100 = 21/09/12. Daily data as of 11/11/13. Past performance is not indicative of future performance."We have built a basket of stocks designed to cushion any future disappointment from Apple on the basis of out/underperformance over the last year," says Misra. "We ranked outperformers as stocks with a rise of more than 10% (since 21 Sept 2012) and underperformers as stocks with a performance inferior to 10% over the period.¬†On this basis we have assembled a basket of stocks that have outperformed the Apple stock over the last year." The stocks that actually comprise the basket are highlighted in the table below. Despite the fact that the basket's composition is based solely on the past performance of the stocks that comprise it, the strategists believe it still contains value. "Our top/bottom basket offers a way to position for the outperformance of Apple‚Äôs Asian suppliers over Apple despite a tightening of supply chain of the latter," writes Misra. And even though the basket of Apple suppliers has outperformed Apple itself, it's actually been underperforming against a broader index of Asian stocks, due to that supply-chain tightening. "The main model feature of Apple‚Äôs success story has always been its ability to reap a high margin," writes Misra. "However, this high-margin model seems to have reached its limit in an increasingly competitive world. So Apple has had no choice but to cut its production costs to maintain an 'Apple yield' on its high-technology products. The underperformance of our basket of suppliers relative to the MSCI Asia equity index (respectively -5.9% for our equally-priced index and -11.7% for our market value-weighted index) seems to show that Apple‚Äôs Asian suppliers are now under pressure."

 Beyond the charts and warnings from economists and investors, perhaps the most disturbing commentary on income inequality in America was written by an investment manager in 2011. "In my view, the American dream of striking it rich is merely a well-marketed fantasy that keeps the bottom 99.5% hoping for better and prevents social and political instability," the manager wrote in an email to Professor G. William Domhoff of the University of California at Santa Cruz. The manager, who asked to remain anonymous to protect his relationship with wealthy clients, expresses his frustration with a financial system that is rigged to help the elites at the cost of everyone else. Domhoff posted the letter to his site, alongside his own commentary from more than 60 years of research on income inequality¬†and¬†the power elite.¬†With his permission, we're publishing the full letter here: I sit in an interesting chair in the financial services industry. Our clients largely fall into the top 1%, have a net worth of $5,000,000 or above, and ‚Äî if working ‚Äî make over $300,000 per year. My observations on the sources of their wealth and concerns come from my professional and social activities within this group. Work by various economists and tax experts make it indisputable that the top 1% controls a widely disproportionate share of the income and wealth in the United States. When does one enter that top 1%? (I'll use "k" for 1,000 and "M" for 1,000,000 as we usually do when communicating with clients or discussing money; thousands and millions take too much time to say.) Available data isn't exact, but a family enters the top 1% or so today with somewhere around $300k to $400k in pre-tax annual income and over $1.2M in net worth. Compared to the average American family with a pre-tax income in the mid-$50k range and net worth around $120k, this probably seems like a lot of money. But, there are big differences within that top 1%, with the wealth distribution highly skewed towards the top 0.1%. The 99th to 99.5th percentiles largely include physicians, attorneys, upper middle management, and small business people who have done well. Everyone's tax situation is, of course, a little different. On earned income in this group, we can figure somewhere around 25% to 30% of total pre-tax income will go to Federal, State, and Social Security taxes, leaving them with around $250k to $300k post tax. This group makes extensive use of 401-k's, SEP-IRA's, Defined Benefit Plans, and other retirement vehicles, which defer taxes until distribution during retirement. Typical would be yearly contributions in the $50k to $100k range, leaving our elite working group with yearly cash flows of $175k to $250k after taxes, or about $15k to $20k per month. Until recently, most studies just broke out the top 1% as a group. Data on net worth distributions within the top 1% indicate that one enters the top 0.5% with about $1.8M, the top 0.25% with $3.1M, the top 0.10% with $5.5M and the top 0.01% with $24.4M. Wealth distribution is highly skewed towards the top 0.01%, increasing the overall average for this group. The net worth for those in the lower half of the top 1% is usually achieved after decades of education, hard work, saving and investing as a professional or small business person. While an after-tax income of $175k to $250k and net worth in the $1.2M to $1.8M range may seem like a lot of money to most Americans, it doesn't really buy freedom from financial worry or access to the true corridors of power and money. That doesn't become frequent until we reach the top 0.1%. I've had many discussions in the last few years with clients with "only" $5M or under in assets, those in the 99th to 99.9th percentiles, as to whether they have enough money to retire or stay retired. That may sound strange to the 99% not in this group, but generally accepted "safe" retirement distribution rates for a 30 year period are in the 3-5% range, with 4% as the current industry standard. Assuming that the lower end of the top 1% has, say, $1.2M in investment assets, their retirement income will be about $50k per year plus maybe $30k-$40k from Social Security, so let's say $90k per year pre-tax and $75-$80k post-tax if they wish to plan for 30 years of withdrawals. For those with $1.8M in retirement assets, that rises to around $120-150k pretax per year and around $100k after tax. If someone retires with $5M today, roughly the beginning rung for entry into the top 0.1%, they can reasonably expect an income of $240k pretax and around $190k post tax, including Social Security. While income and lifestyle are all relative, an after-tax income between $6.6k and $8.3k per month today will hardly buy the fantasy lifestyles that Americans see on TV and would consider "rich". In many areas in California or the East Coast, this positions one squarely in the hard working upper-middle class, and strict budgeting will be essential. An income of $190k post tax or $15.8k per month will certainly buy a nice lifestyle but is far from rich. And, for those folks who made enough to accumulate this much wealth during their working years, the reduction in income and lifestyle during retirement can be stressful. Plus, watching retirement accounts deplete over time isn't fun, not to mention the ever-fluctuating value of these accounts and the desire of many to leave a substantial inheritance. Our poor lower half of the top 1% lives well but has some financial worries. Since the majority of those in this group actually earned their money from professions and smaller businesses, they generally don't participate in the benefits big money enjoys. Those in the 99th to 99.5th percentile lack access to power. For example, most physicians today are having their incomes reduced by HMO's, PPO's and cost controls from Medicare and insurance companies; the legal profession is suffering from excess capacity, declining demand and global outsourcing; successful small businesses struggle with increasing regulation and taxation. I speak daily with these relative winners in the economic hierarchy and many express frustration. Unlike those in the lower half of the top 1%, those in the top half and, particularly, top 0.1%, can often borrow for almost nothing, keep profits and production overseas, hold personal assets in tax havens, ride out down markets and economies, and influence legislation in the U.S. They have access to the very best in accounting firms, tax and other attorneys, numerous consultants, private wealth managers, a network of other wealthy and powerful friends, lucrative business opportunities, and many other benefits. Most of those in the bottom half of the top 1% lack power and global flexibility and are essentially well-compensated workhorses for the top 0.5%, just like the bottom 99%. In my view, the American dream of striking it rich is merely a well-marketed fantasy that keeps the bottom 99.5% hoping for better and prevents social and political instability. The odds of getting into that top 0.5% are very slim and the door is kept firmly shut by those within it. Membership in this elite group is likely to come from being involved in some aspect of the financial services or banking industry, real estate development involved with those industries, or government contracting. Some hard working and clever physicians and attorneys can acquire as much as $15M-$20M before retirement but they are rare. Those in the top 0.5% have incomes over $500k if working and a net worth over $1.8M if retired. The higher we go up into the top 0.5% the more likely it is that their wealth is in some way tied to the investment industry and borrowed money than from personally selling goods or services or labor as do most in the bottom 99.5%. They are much more likely to have built their net worth from stock options and capital gains in stocks and real estate and private business sales, not from income which is taxed at a much higher rate. These opportunities are largely unavailable to the bottom 99.5%. Recently, I spoke with a younger client who retired from a major investment bank in her early thirties, net worth around $8M. We can estimate that she had to earn somewhere around twice that, or $14M-$16M, in order to keep $8M after taxes and live well along the way, an impressive accomplishment by such an early age. Since I knew she held a critical view of investment banking, I asked if her colleagues talked about or understood how much damage was created in the broader economy from their activities. Her answer was that no one talks about it in public but almost all understood and were unbelievably cynical, hoping to exit the system when they became rich enough. Folks in the top 0.1% come from many backgrounds but it's infrequent to meet one whose wealth wasn't acquired through direct or indirect participation in the financial and banking industries. One of our clients, net worth in the $60M range, built a small company and was acquired with stock from a multi-national. Stock is often called a "paper" asset. Another client, CEO of a medium-cap tech company, retired with a net worth in the $70M range. The bulk of any CEO's wealth comes from stock, not income, and incomes are also very high. Last year, the average S&amp;P 500 CEO made $9M in all forms of compensation. One client runs a division of a major international investment bank, net worth in the $30M range and most of the profits from his division flow directly or indirectly from the public sector, the taxpayer. Another client with a net worth in the $10M range is the ex-wife of a managing director of a major investment bank, while another was able to amass $12M after taxes by her early thirties from stock options as a high level programmer in a successful IT company. The picture is clear; entry into the top 0.5% and, particularly, the top 0.1% is usually the result of some association with the financial industry and its creations. I find it questionable as to whether the majority in this group actually adds value or simply diverts value from the US economy and business into its pockets and the pockets of the uber-wealthy who hire them. They are, of course, doing nothing illegal. I think it's important to emphasize one of the dangers of wealth concentration: irresponsibility about the wider economic consequences of their actions by those at the top. Wall Street created the investment products that produced gross economic imbalances and the 2008 credit crisis. It wasn't the hard-working 99.5%. Average people could only destroy themselves financially, not the economic system. There's plenty of blame to go around, but the collapse was primarily due to the failure of complex mortgage derivatives, CDS credit swaps, cheap Fed money, lax regulation, compromised ratings agencies, government involvement in the mortgage market, the end of the Glass-Steagall Act in 1999, and insufficient bank capital. Only Wall Street could put the economy at risk and it had an excellent reason to do so: profit. It made huge profits in the build-up to the credit crisis and huge profits when it sold itself as "too big to fail" and received massive government and Federal Reserve bailouts. Most of the serious economic damage the U.S. is struggling with today was done by the top 0.1% and they benefited greatly from it. Not surprisingly, Wall Street and the top of corporate America are doing extremely well as of June 2011. For example, in Q1 of 2011, America's top corporations reported 31% profit growth and a 31% reduction in taxes, the latter due to profit outsourcing to low tax rate countries. Somewhere around 40% of the profits in the S&amp;P 500 come from overseas and stay overseas, with about half of these 500 top corporations having their headquarters in tax havens. If the corporations don't repatriate their profits, they pay no U.S. taxes. The year 2010 was a record year for compensation on Wall Street, while corporate CEO compensation rose by over 30%, most Americans struggled. In 2010 a dozen major companies, including GE, Verizon, Boeing, Wells Fargo, and Fed Ex paid US tax rates between -0.7% and -9.2%. Production, employment, profits, and taxes have all been outsourced. Major U.S. corporations are currently lobbying to have another "tax-repatriation" window like that in 2004 where they can bring back corporate profits at a 5.25% tax rate versus the usual 35% US corporate tax rate. Ordinary working citizens with the lowest incomes are taxed at 10%. I could go on and on, but the bottom line is this: A highly complex set of laws and exemptions from laws and taxes has been put in place by those in the uppermost reaches of the U.S. financial system. It allows them to protect and increase their wealth and significantly affect the U.S. political and legislative processes. They have real power and real wealth. Ordinary citizens in the bottom 99.9% are largely not aware of these systems, do not understand how they work, are unlikely to participate in them, and have little likelihood of entering the top 0.5%, much less the top 0.1%. Moreover, those at the very top have no incentive whatsoever for revealing or changing the rules. I am not optimistic. A few blogs and emails have disagreed with the views presented in this article. I'll address two of them here: A New York Times article (Economix, 1/17/12) agrees that the threshold for being in the top 1 per cent in household¬†income¬†is about $380k but states that, based on Fed data, the 1% threshold for¬†net worth¬†is $8.4M. The figure I use is around $1.5M and comes from the IRS. The Fed uses a simple formula based on assets and liabilities at a broad level of analysis with little detail. Using Fed data, about 8% of US households have a net worth exceeding $1M and the median net worth of the top 10% of US families is $1.569M. The IRS uses the estate multiplier technique to calculate the data, a more complex measure based on tax returns, capitalization of earnings power, and other factors. The estate multiplier technique has been around for decades, is more widely used, and in the opinion of many, is the more accurate number. Where the true threshold is located is impossible to determine with accuracy, but my observations in managing money support the lower number or something close to it. One reader opined that my analysis regarding the bottom half and top half of the top 1% is incorrect and that many business people can amass $20M. Based on my experience with at least a thousand high net worth folks over the last couple of decades, I disagree. The folks in the top 0.5% and particularly the top 0.1% are in my experience very likely to have been the recipients of largesse in the investment industry or banking industry, and this includes those at the top of corporations where compensation is tied to options and stock or those who have careers near the top of the banking and investment industry. There are exceptions, of course. Let's make the assumption that someone who has an income in the top 1% would reasonably be expected to retire in the top 1%. Everybody's tax situation is a little different, depending upon the state they live in and the deductions they can make. Someone making $380k gross will likely pay about a third of that in Federal and State taxes, leaving about $250k after taxes. Generally, someone making $380k will want to live fairly well, certainly not at the level of the average dual working couple with an income around $55k. Let's say they spend $150k/year, hardly a high end budget in most of the US. That leaves about $100k per year to invest. It is unlikely that even with investment success they are going to amass $10M or $20M by the end of their careers. This fits my observations working with many physicians in many different specialties, and it is generally getting harder to make money in medicine than in the past. Older physicians are retiring today with around $3M to $8M, with just a few above that. Younger physicians are making between $200k and $400k annually ‚Äî with a few specialties above that ‚Äî and their typical annual investment contributions run between $50k and $100k. The bottom line here is that I think it is very difficult to create a net worth in excess of $10M from income alone. Yes, sports stars, entertainers, and some business people do -- but they are rare. Those with a higher net worth tend to acquire most of their net worth from capital gains, not income that has been saved and invested. Large capital gains tend to come when private businesses are acquired by private or public companies with stock or when executives are paid directly by options or stock. Wall Street and the banking industry are frequently involved, either directly or indirectly.

For the U.S. stock market, it appears the rolling five-year has been the return that investors have most closely followed based upon their investing behavior in recent years [Figure 1]. The five-year trailing annualized return¬†for the S&amp;P 500 has been weak, especially when compared with bonds, in recent years. In fact, even as recently as the end of August 2013, the difference in the¬†five-year annualized return between stocks and bonds was only about 2%, hardly enough to compensate investors for the volatility they experienced¬†[Figure 2]. Yet that difference has started to soar and may lead to investors chasing returns into the stock market. LPL Financial In the past few weeks, the five-year return has soared into the double¬†digits ‚Äî reflecting not only a strong recent trend in the stock market, but the dropping off of much of the horrific declines in the fall of 2008, when the financial crisis took hold. The gap between stock and bond market returns over the past five years as of the end of last week widened to 10%. As of March 6, 2014, five years from the bear market low in the S&amp;P 500 ‚Äî even assuming no additional gains in the stock market between now and then ‚Äî the five-year annualized return may have exceeded bonds by 20%!¬†The one-, three-, and five-year trailing annualized returns are now in the double digits for the first time this cycle [Figure 3]. This may prompt many investors to reconsider the role of stocks in their portfolios ‚Äî especially as interest rates rise and bond performance lags. LPL Financial In fact, a great rotation back to stocks may already be underway. Net inflows have been positive into bond funds over the past five years, while funds that invest in U.S. stocks saw net outflows, according to ICI data.¬†But the month of October 2013 saw the biggest monthly inflows to funds¬†that invest in U.S. stocks in years (excluding January‚Äôs seasonal peak for¬†inflows) ‚Äî despite the concerns over the government shutdown and debt¬†ceiling. It is no surprise that this took place just as the five-year trailing¬†return for stocks began to soar into double digits. Although corporations will likely remain buyers of their stocks in the coming year, 2014 may finally be the year that individual investors as a group begin to buy stocks in contrast to the net selling they have done since the bull market began nearly five years ago. This may help to continue the rise in the valuations that defined this year‚Äôs outstanding gains for stocks.

U.S. Congressional Research ServiceCountries involved in the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership. WikiLeaks has published a leaked draft†from a massive international trade agreement that is currently being negotiated. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) involves†a 12-nation regional trade bloc that accounts for almost 40% of global gross domestic product (GDP) and about one-third of all world trade. The U.S. is leading negotiations and expects them to be finished this year.† WikiLeaks published a draft, dated Aug. 30, that†it says is†the intellectual property rights chapter†of the proposed pact that was debated in the 19th negotiating round. Intellectual property law expert Matthew Rimmer†told the Sydney Morning Herald†that the leaked draft favored†U.S. trade objectives and multinational corporate interests "with little focus on the rights and interests of consumers, let alone broader community interests." Dr. Rimmer†continued: "One could see the TPP as a Christmas wish-list for major corporations, and the copyright parts of the text support such a view.†Hollywood, the music industry, big IT companies such as Microsoft and the pharmaceutical sector would all be very happy with this." Internet freedom advocates consider the TTP to be†the biggest threat to the global Internet in years. The Electronic Frontier Foundation†describes†the TTP as "a secretive, multi-national trade agreement that threatens to extend restrictive intellectual property (IP) laws across the globe and rewrite international rules on its enforcement." Daniel Drezner†of Foreign Policy notes that there are several inaccuracies in the WikiLeaks press release, but also says that the organization "actually makes a decent point to make on the intellectual property front." WikiLeaksA cartoon published by WikiLeaks along with the leaked draft.WikiLeaks claims that the proposed IP chapter would "replicates many of the surveillance and enforcement provisions from the shelved SOPA and ACTA treaties." The Stop Online Piracy Act†(SOPA)†was a proposed U.S. law that would have allowed the government to create a ìblacklistî of copyright-infringing websites that could be blocked.†The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) is a stalled pact that would greatly increase the power of international bodies to†enforce copyright laws. ìIf instituted, the TPPís IP regime would trample over individual rights and free expression, as well as ride roughshod over the intellectual and creative commons," according to†WikiLeaksí Editor-in-Chief Julian Assange.
New York City is one of the greatest cities in the world for pedestrians. But it can also be a dangerous city for pedestrians. Whether you are darting across the street against a red light, or simply too immersed in your phones to pay attention to traffic, Manhattan's pedestrians take their lives into their hands on a daily basis. Dangerous Roads NYC seeks to use the NYPD's somewhat sparse data on collisions to map out these dangers. Enter any address, or a route between two addresses, and a mode of transportation (car, bike, pedestrian), and the site will give a helpful map showing either the 5 or 10 most dangerous spots near the address or along the route. The data was drawn from the NYPD and coded by John Kauss. Jared Stone, the website's found notes that the data the NYPD makes publicly available is indeed fragmented. Specifically, it only accounts for incidents in intersections, not in between Manhattan's many cross streets. Here are the ten most dangerous intersections in Manhattan for pedestrians according to Dangerous Roads NYC: Google Maps Google Maps Google Maps Google Maps Google Maps Google Maps Google Maps Google Maps Google Maps Google Maps
For the past 10 years, troops from the U.S. and our allies have been in Afghanistan as part of a war that has cost billions of dollars. So, what happened to the country's opium poppy crop during that time? It's at a record high: Reuters Reuters reports that the country's record crop will embarrass Afghanistan's aid donors after more than 10 years of efforts to wean farmers off the crop, fight corruption, and cut links between drugs and the Taliban insurgency. It is estimated that this year Afghanistan may supply 90% of the world's opium, which is used to create the illicit street drug heroin.
Christie's Last night, an unknown buyer paid $142 million for Irish-born British painter Francis Bacon's "Three Studies of Lucian Freud." With a "hammer price" of $127 million plus a $15 million commission, it's a nominal record for a work bought at auction.† Bacon is a strong candidate for greatest painter of the 20th century, having escaped the orbit of the pure abstract expressionists to create his own visceral mode of painting portraits. Still, given the debate over rising inequality in the U.S. and elsewhere, paying $142 million for a work of art may seem ... extreme. And that's probably true. However, the mechanics of the art world suggest the amount is justifiable. First, as a triptych, the buyer is actually getting three paintings for the price of one. Plus, for a decade after their initial 1970 exhibition the works were displayed separately, apparently to Bacon's great frustration, according to The Wall Street Journal's Kelly Crow. Today the piece is one of two complete triptychs Bacon made of Freud, another world famous artist (and grandson of Sigmund Freud) who was heavily influenced by Bacon. (Both are now dead by the way, and, grimly, death helps drive up value).†And it apparently took a lot of effort to get all three canvases in one place. So a premium has been placed on reuniting the works.† Meanwhile, the previous record for a contemporary work sold at auction was also a Bacon: In 2008 (an ominous year, to be sure), Roman Abramovich paid $86.3 million ó $94 million in real dollars ó for a triptych (simply titled "Triptych") of a more recent vintage (1976). Works often decline in value the later they came in an artist's career. Scale can also affect price, and each of the canvases in "Freud" are 6 ft. tall. And the brightness of a painting can also drive up its value, and the top half of "Freud" glows with orange and yellow. Finally, the Christie's team juiced the sale of the work by moving it up in the auction lot at the last minute, sensing strong demand. The opening price was set at $80 million and the first bid came in at $100 million.†Art Market Monitor's Howard Rehs has discussed the pricing momentum the right work can generate through 1% groupthink: "What really makes an artistís market viable is the amount of support it has, or: how many players are in the game?† In addition, how many of those players will always be there to make sure the price levels stay up?† The more support, the more stable a market becomes. ...†When you have tens of millions, or even hundreds of millions, invested in an artistís work you do not want to see values go down. The world set a record this year for total number of billionaires.†Among the very rich, at least, this appears to be a sign the earnings accumulated in the last few years are not going anywhere.†
CNNMoneyJim O'Neill.Former Goldman Sachs economist Jim O'Neill is the one who popularized the term "BRICs" in reference to the group of emerging-market economies made up of Brazil, Russia, India, and China. This year, however, the fortunes of those economies have taken a turn for the worse for various reasons, and many investors are abandoning the idea that they will be able to continue the rapid growth that has characterized the past several years. Much investor attention has therefore shifted from emerging markets to "frontier markets," a classification made up of economies smaller than those of the BRICs. In a new column for Bloomberg View, O'Neill presents a new potential investment destination: the "MINT" economies (emphasis added): I spent last week in Indonesia, working on a series for BBC Radio about four of the worldís most populous non-BRIC emerging economies. The BRIC countries -- Brazil, Russia, India and China -- are already closely watched. The group Iím studying for this project -- letís call them the MINT economies -- deserve no less attention. Mexico, Indonesia, Nigeria and Turkey all have very favorable demographics for at least the next 20 years, and their economic prospects are interesting. Policy makers and thinkers in the MINT countries have often asked me why I left them out of that first classification. Indonesians made the point with particular force. Over the years Iíve become accustomed to being told that the BRIC countries should have been the BRIICs all along, or maybe even the BIICs. Wasnít Indonesiaís economic potential more compelling than Russiaís? Despite the size of its relatively young population (a tremendous asset), I thought it unlikely that Indonesia would do enough on the economic-policy front to quickly realize that potential. "Now, meeting a diverse group of Indonesians ó from the leading candidates for the 2014 presidential elections to shoppers in Jakartaís busy malls ó I found a healthy preoccupation with the countryís economic prospects," writes O'Neill. "Could Indonesia do whatís needed to lift the countryís growth rate to 7 percent or more, they were asking, or would it have to settle for 'just' 5 percent?" Fellow Bloomberg View columnist Matthew C. Klein points out on Twitter that Fidelity actually coined the term "MINT" in 2011: Apparently Fidelity came up with the MINT acronym a few years before Jim O'Neill: http://t.co/rokhnDf5Kq h/t @Ian_Fraser

Tesla will not have more than six models on the market at any given time, CEO Elon Musk said at Business Insider's IGNITION event in New York on Tuesday. Asked if Tesla plans to expand the way automakers like Ford and GM have, offering dozens of models, Musk said Tesla would max out around half a dozen. There has to be a "real difference" between the models, he explained. Ford, by contrast, has more than 20 models on the market now, including five sedans and five crossovers/SUVs. There are about 25,000 Model S sedans on the road now, and the Model X is due to hit the market late next year. After that will come the long-awaited "affordable" Tesla, which will cost about $35,000 and be the size of a BMW 3-Series (the Model S is closer to a BMW 5- or 7-Series). At IGNITION, Musk said that price tag makes it "kind of" a luxury car, but argued years of savings on gas, as well as Tesla's financing options, would make it affordable. That price range "is actually the sweet spot of the market," he said. Musk also said Tesla plans to build an electric pickup truck like Ford's F-150, probably in about five years.
Christie'sIt took all of six minutes for†Francis Bacon's triptych "Three Studies of Lucian Freud" to fetch a record-setting $142.4 million when it came under the hammer last night at Christie's in New York.  That makes it the most expensive work of art ever sold at auction. It was also†the first time these three paintings were on the auction market after they were owned separately for 15 years.† We were in the room last night when the painting sold, and while a buzz ran through the packed crowd at the auction house's Rockefeller Plaza, it was restrained to a proper golf-clap level. Christie's They politely applauded twice more during the session, a sign they were impressed by the sales of both Jeff Koons' "Balloon Dog (Orange)," which won a hammer price of $52 million ($58.4 million total), and Andy Warhol's "Diamond Dust Shoes," which took a winning bid of $4.25 million ($4.93 million total) after a particularly harried back-and-forth session between over-the-phone bidders.†† The winning bid for Bacon's three gold-framed paintings of his friend and rival figurative painter Lucian Freud hit $127 million, but the total price climbed to $142.4 million with the buyer's premium (at Christie's, that's 12% of the hammer price for pieces over $50,000.) Seven bidders fought for the piece both in person and over the phone in a frenzied six-minute bidding war for the triptych, the only piece of art physically in the room during the evening sale. The winning bid came over the phone, and the buyer remains anonymous. "A million dollars is a lot of money," the British auctioneer intoned when bidding for the Bacon momentarily stalled.†The auctioneer spoke clearly and calmly while keeping up the pace in the room. Two men stood behind him and spotters stood among the hundreds in the sale room to point out bidders who might have gotten lost in the swell. Christie'sJeff Koons' "Balloon Dog (Orange)" sold for $58.4 millionStill, he largely bandied about with his team of roughly 30 Christie's staffers who stood covering their mouths around telephones, working with off-site bidders.  "Beautiful thing, beautiful thing," the auctioneer crooned to encourage more bidding. Other times, he'd cut the tension with "Yes, I see you bidding. Two-eight (as in $2.8 million) is your bid. Does your client know that?" Then he'd crack a wry smile. "Three Studies" sold in one of the longer bidding wars of the evening, which saw nearly all 73 lots, or works of art for sale, make their minimums. Only a couple lots were passed, which means the work couldn't be sold because bidding hadn't reached the seller's minimum price, and four were withdrawn. Bidding ended before 9:30 p.m. after starting late (even later than the announced 15-minute delay) to give bidders time to adjust to the change of the Bacon triptych from Lot 32 to Lot 8a. Instead of having to wait until the middle of the evening for the most-hyped piece, bidders had at the painting within 20 minutes of starting the sale. † It was a blockbuster evening for Christie's: Sales totaled $691.6 million in one night, the highest auction total in art market history. † The big week for auctions continues tonight. Next on the block at Sotheby's is a piece from Andy Warhol's famed Disaster series: "Silver Car Crash (Double Disaster)." Warhols routinely sell for millions, and since they're silk screened they're often not particularly rare pieces. But because "Silver Car Crash" is the last privately owned car crash work in a set of four,†Sotheby's†says it could fetch upward of $60 million at tonight's evening sale in New York.†

Flickr/Yasunobu HiraokaMany on Wall Street believe the American economy will finally pick up in 2014. BofA Merrill Lynch chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett argues "escape velocity" is "tantalizingly close." Nonetheless, it hasn't happened yet, and the ultimate debate about the future of the U.S. economy is still this: can it? If recent trends in sub-par GDP and labor market growth reflect a structural decline in the economy's potential, the answer might be no. If we are still just working through the cyclical damage from the recession that gripped the U.S. six years ago, on the other hand ‚Äî and the persistent fiscal drag that has weighed on the economy in more recent years ‚Äî then perhaps the answer is yes. The government shutdown seemed to bring out a fair amount of pessimism toward the matter. Jonathan Laing wrote of a "stark reality that many politicians and their constituents are unaware of" in an October 28 Barron's article. "U.S. economic growth figures to slow dramatically over the next 20 years or so," said Laing, "generating far less money to achieve the Republican goal of a balanced budget or the Democratic aim of continued social spending." The discussion was taking a tilt toward the bearish side among investors as well. "We've noticed investor sentiment shift decisively through the course of the year," wrote Dario Perkins, director of global economics at Lombard Street Research, in an October 17 note.¬†"The economy‚Äôs recent sluggishness has made our clients more sceptical of our strong 2014 forecast." In an August report, JPMorgan economist Michael Feroli broke down the argument that the country's future isn't what it used to be by demonstrating that potential GDP growth ‚Äì a proxy for the long-run trend growth rate ‚Äì in the United States has fallen below 2%. "As recently as the late 1990s, potential growth in the U.S. was estimated to be around 3.5%; by our estimates that figure has recently fallen by half, to 1.75%," wrote Feroli. The JPMorgan economist explained how an aging society, a crackdown on immigration, decreased levels of innovation in information technology, and declining R&amp;D spending in both the private and public sectors were all dragging this figure lower. Of course, there likely are cyclical factors at work as well ‚Äî remnants of the damage caused by the recession. Joe LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank, points out that Federal Reserve officials believe the impairment in potential growth is only temporary. "The Chairman cited three factors behind the possible decline in potential GDP growth: One, a labor mismatch; two, a lack of business investment; and three, an inability of firms to find commercial applications for new technologies," wrote LaVorgna in a recent note to clients, citing a November 20, 2012 speech by Fed chairman Ben Bernanke. BLS, Haver Analytics & DB Global Markets ResearchLaVorgna warns that these impediments may be structural, however. "While intuitive, we are worried by the fact that much of the weakness in job growth has been in three areas of the economy‚Äîconstruction, finance and government‚Äîand this could be more structural than cyclical in nature," he writes. "This is evident in the nearby chart, which shows reasonably solid job gains outside of the sectors which boomed in the previous expansion. Regulatory and budgetary impediments will likely continue to weigh on job growth in the financial and government sectors; construction employment should improve, but only modestly." LSR's Perkins believes American growth potential will make a comeback nonetheless. For a variety of reasons related to the severity and duration of the recession, it is likely U.S.¬†potential output has slowed since 2008," he says. "But this doesn‚Äôt mean the economy is now doomed¬†to persistently sluggish activity." Perkins argues that "powerful cyclical forces have been depressing demand" as the private sector retrenched in the wake of the crisis: By 2012, these drags on private sector demand had started to fade. The recession in the housing market had ended, with construction activity and house prices beginning to recover. This started as a rental/apartment boom, but it was gradually becoming broader based. Meanwhile, the private-sector deleveraging process seemed to be nearing an end. Household debt had fallen sharply relative to income and, according to our analysis, was returning to sustainable levels. Debt servicing costs were also at historic lows, easing the desire to rebuild balance sheets. Finally, the banking sector was in better shape, with lower levels of leverage and improving profitability. This was feeding an economy-wide¬†improvement in credit availability. "Given these positive dynamics, clients often ask why the economy has not recovered more meaningfully over the past 12 months," says Perkins. "The simple answer is that public-sector retrenchment has taken over from private-sector retrenchment. In 2013, the government has implemented a structural budget tightening worth more than 3% of GDP ‚Äì the largest since at least the 1980s." OECD, Lombard Street ResearchPerkins believes the outlook for public-sector retrenchment is key. "By cutting government spending and raising taxes, this has depressed¬†overall activity and masked a significant improvement in underlying demand. This is¬†important because it means, if the fiscal drag fades in 2014, growth could pick up materially," argues Perkins. "Potential GDP isn‚Äôt a fixed concept. Just as the recession dragged¬†potential growth lower, sustained strong growth would eventually help to reverse this trend."¬†
If there's one thing we can learn from the history of media, it is this: Money follows eyeballs. When readers, viewers, or listeners abandon certain content for other content (change the channel) or one medium for another, advertising and subscription revenue eventually follows. Right now, there's a major eyeball shift going on in media: People are abandoning traditional media and turning to mobile digital media. This chart from BI Intelligence is based on data from eMarketer and is included in our FUTURE OF DIGITAL deck. It shows the average share of media consumption by medium in the U.S. for the last several years. As you can see, mobile is growing, and everything else is shrinking. BI Intelligence  One key question that flows from this chart is the shift within digital ó from "online" to "mobile." But as "mobile" becomes harder and harder to define, the distinction between "desktop" and "mobile" becomes less and less relevant: Are tablets mobile? Or just smartphones? What about phablets? What about super-light laptops? What about TVs showing content streamed over WiFi from a smartphone? The broader point in the chart above, arguably, is that digital is winning and everything else is losing. SEE ALSO: The Future Of Digital: 2013
REUTERSPeter Praet.European Central bank governor Peter Praet told the Wall Street Journal that all options were on the table at the ECB for further monetary easing, and the euro just took a dive. The WSJ's Brian Blackstone has the story: "If our mandate is at risk we are going to take all the measures that we think we should take to fulfill that mandate. That's a very clear signal," ECB executive board member Peter Praet said in an interview Tuesday with The Wall Street Journal. Annual inflation in the euro zone slowed to 0.7% in October, far below the central bank's target of just below 2% over the medium term. He didn't rule out what some analysts see as the strongest, and most controversial, option: purchases of assets from banks to reduce borrowing costs in the private sector. "The balance-sheet capacity of the central bank can also be used," said Mr. Praet, whose views carry added weight as he also heads the ECB's powerful economics division. "This includes outright purchases that any central bank can do." Right now, the euro is trading right around $1.3400 versus levels around $1.3450 prior to the comments hitting the tape, down 0.25% on the day. Seasoned ECB-watcher Lorcan Roche Kelly backs up Blackstone's claim that Praet's views carry added weight: took about 20 mins there for the market to figure out whether Praet matters at the @ecb. FWIW, he does more than most "We think that the arguments for rate cuts have been strengthened, but a quarter-point cut in the policy rate might be too little to stave off deflation risks," says¬†Jan HaÃàggstroÃàm, head of economic research at Svenska Handelsbanken in Stockholm.¬†"There is much to be said about the risks of quantitative easing, but it is quite clear that the growth outperformance of the U.S., U.K. and Japan relative to the eurozone has something to do with the fact that their central banks have been massive buyers of bonds and the ECB has not."
Getty Images/Alex WongElizabeth Warren before a Congressional hearing.After Noam Scheiber's cover story in¬†The New Republic this week set off a firestorm of articles on Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and a potential 2016 run (it's not happening), reporters have turned their attention to whether Warren could shift the conversation and bring financial reform to forefront of the next presidential election. The short answer: No. Here's Jonathan Chait today on its political potential: So what may be the most powerful issue in American politics has lay unused by either party since the crisis. Either party could pick it up. A¬†bill to break up the big banks¬†has the sponsorship of liberal Democrat Sherrod Brown and conservative Republican David Vitter. Warren has a¬†tough regulatory proposal¬†of her own, which has the support of John McCain. A Warren campaign could force Clinton to follow suit, and possibly even pressure the Republican nominee. Whenever a supposedly politically salient issue is being ignored by both sides, it's important to ask why. In this case, it's pretty obvious. Financial reform isn't sexy. It's complicated and boring. A policy agenda focused on increased regulation doesn't bring out voters. That's part of the reason why many politicians settle on breaking up the big banks as their preferred policy prescription. It's easy to explain. Rallying support for greater capital requirements doesn't work. But Wall Street is a powerful force in Washington. Despite his populist rhetoric in 2008, President Obama accepted huge donations from banks and financial institutions. That was in a year when financial reform was at its peak. As the economy has slowly recovered (emphasis on slowly), the public's attention has shifted away from financial reform towards jobs and Obamacare. There simply isn't a strong appetite for the issue. Add in the fact that demonizing the banks will put a candidate at a distinct monetary disadvantage and it's easy to see why Clinton will likely take a moderate line on financial reform. No matter how many speeches Warren gives, the fundamental nature of reform is that it is isn't salient with voters. Few issues have an impact on elections and financial reform won't be one them.
It's not easy to get access to China's domestic stock market. China's A-shares, or shares of mainland Chinese companies that trade in renminbi on¬†Chinese stock exchanges such as the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, have always been closed off to foreigners. ¬†Only big institutional investors,¬†with the resources to jump through the Chinese government's hoops, had been given limited access to the A-shares market.

So listen up, because now Cashin is warning about solar storms. In today's note from UBS, Cashin forwards along an email he received from Arch Crawford ‚Äî a friend "renowned for his astrological calls on the stock market." Here's Crawford: We have written for awhile that Solar Storms will disrupt portions of electrical grids on the earth. Energy of storms heaviest¬†Nov 13 &amp; 23. There's Great danger of "inconvenience"; some danger that the grids will fail. Article on pg 3 of WSJ¬†Monday¬†says the scientists are confused by the actions of the SUN. My work is NOT confused.

We recommend having extra food/water/cash on hand just in case. Also, Pray that it is a "glancing blow"! The theory is based on John H. Nelson's "helio-centric" astronomical theory, according to Cashin. "In the days before satellites, global radio signals could often be disrupted by upper atmosphere disturbances (ionization), which, Nelson maintained, were linked to solar flares and sunspots," Cashin writes. "Just as the tides on Earth vary according to the movement and relationship of the moon and sun; Nelson thought the angles of the planets might affect the 'tides' of the sun." But Cashin says he disagrees slightly with pal Crawford. "The planets he cites are Jupiter, Uranus and Pluto. Jupiter, due to its size, was a key to Nelson's theory but Uranus and Pluto less so.¬† So, if I am right (hopefully), we may have an event but not a huge one."
Business Insider / Will WeiElectric car company Tesla is planning to make a pickup truck, CEO Elon Musk said yesterday. The truck will likely be the same type of vehicle as Ford's F-Series pickup trucks. The Ford F-150 is the best-selling vehicle of any kind in the United States. Musk said Tesla might make the truck in 5 years. Tesla CEO Elon Musk spoke at Business Insider's IGNITION event in New York yesterday. He made his remarks about the pickup truck during a post-interview Q&amp;A session at the side of the stage. After he descended the stage, Musk was surrounded by a crowd of conference attendees, and he answered questions about Tesla and his rocket company, SpaceX, for about half an hour. Musk's comments about the truck came after he was asked whether Tesla would ever make a fleet truck for the likes of FedEx or UPS. He said that, yes, Tesla was planning to make a truck, but not a commercial one, because the market opportunity for commercial trucks is much smaller. Musk said the Tesla truck would be modeled on Ford's F-Series in part because of that truck's remarkable popularity. 60,000 F-150s were sold in the month of September. (On a related note, I drove a Tesla Model S for the first time yesterday. It was as remarkable an experience as people say. Stomping on the "gas" produces a burst of acceleration that is both breathtaking and silent. I'm not a luxury-sedan guy, and I can't run a charge cord out my window in the city, so the S isn't for me. But I quickly put in the first pre-order for the Tesla pickup truck.) (On another related note, don't miss this clip in which Musk describes how both Tesla and SpaceX almost went bankrupt at the same time in 2008. In a desperate attempt to save the companies, Musk split his remaining assets between them. But by the end of the year, they were both days away from death. Musk said he nearly had a nervous breakdown. WATCH &gt;)

REUTERS/Jason Lee The Shanghai Composite tumbled 1.8% Wednesday after the communique from the 3rd Plenum disappointed markets. Markets had been looking for reforms related to the financial sector, state-owned enterprises (SOE), land-reform, Hukou (residency permit system), and the one-child policy. Instead they received a broad blueprint. † The communique did change the language surrounding the role of markets. Beijing now thinks the market has gone from playing a†Jichuxing (basic) role in the economy, to Juedingxing, (decisive) role in the economy. "We suspect the Chinese people wonít interpret too much from this change," writes Bank of America's Ting Lu.† So what can we take away from the communique? Not everyone, however, was disappointed. Yao said the Plenum met her expectations. Based on the communique she maintains her expectations that the most likely and imminent measures will be interest rate liberalization, more experiments in the Shanghai free-trade zone, and a relaxation of the one-child policy.

Britain's FTSE 100 is tumbling. It's down by around 1.5% right now, and it's underperforming the European markets. Earlier today, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said that the country's unemployment rate was falling faster than expected. This appears to be a signal that the central bank may tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. The pound also spiked on the news. Bloomberg.com
British police announced that†they consider the bizarre death of a UK spy to be an accident and that no one else was present in his apartment when it occurred, Raphael Satter of the Associated Press reports. Gareth Williams, 30, a†cyberwarfare expert working for Britain's GCHQ eavesdropping service and the overseas espionage agency MI6, was found naked in a†padlocked gym bag in the bathroom of his central London flat on August 23, 2010. Metropolitan Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Martin Hewitt said†a" more probable conclusion that there was no other person present when Gareth died," adding that†there was "no evidence to support the theory that Gareth's death was in any way related to his work." From AP: Some have raised the possibility that Williams locked himself in the bag as part of a sex game gone wrong. Investigators found that he had visited bondage and sadomasochism websites, including some related to claustrophilia ó a desire for confinement in enclosed spaces. Police concluded that it could have been possible for Williams to climb inside the sports bag and lock it. Here are some still shots from a police video†showing a man demonstrating if it was possible that Williams could have locked himself into the bag.REUTERS/Metropolitan PoliceThe initial entry. REUTERS/Metropolitan PolicePulling the legs in. REUTERS/Metropolitan PoliceReaching for the cover.REUTERS/Metropolitan PoliceClosing the bag.REUTERS/Metropolitan PoliceThere are serious issues with that conclusion.†Satter notes that "none of Williams' DNA was found on the lock on the bag and his palm prints were not found on the rim of the bath." Furthermore, it's unclear how Williams would have been able to padlock the bag from the inside. The coroner,†Fiona Wilcox,†concluded last year that Williams had probably been killed by another person in a "criminally meditated act." Wilcox's report was critical of MI6, which failed to pass evidence to investigating police. Hewitt†chief added that "for both hypotheses [of accident of murder], there exist evidential contradictions and gaps in our understanding." The†death has been widely considered a murder since it occurred.† Here's the Reuters caption for the last known photograph of Williams (published on September 7, 2010): "A still image taken from a video security camera shows murder victim Gareth Williams at Holland Park tube station in London August 14, 2010."

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan bonds dropped sharply on Tuesday after President Nicolas Maduro ordered a military takeover of an electronics chain and authorities arrested dozens of people for purported price gouging. Maduro's "economic offensive" to tame inflation running at over 54 percent has also included arrests of 28 people since Saturday for allegedly selling goods at "speculative" prices, sparking concerns about the overall economic and political panorama. "(The bond price drops are) definitely a reaction to the perception that the government is ordering a semi-organized episode of looting," said one Wall Street source who asked not to be identified, referring to the government forcing shops to slash prices on goods deemed to be overpriced. Venezuela's sovereign global bonds, which did not trade on Monday due to a market holiday, were down 5.71 percent, according to the JPMorgan EMBI+ Index's returns, compared with a drop of 1.04 percent for the broader emerging market index. The benchmark Venezuela Global 27, due in 2027, was down 2.51 points, or 3.24 percent. Soldiers over the weekend occupied stores of the Daka electronics chain, forcing it to sell products at cheaper prices and detaining several managers in a move echoing the confrontational style of late socialist leader Hugo Chavez. On Tuesday, hundreds of people were still crowding around Caracas electronics stores, with police and soldiers deployed to maintain order. Prices are down between 20 and 60 pct after the government's "economic offensive," those in line said. "Why are there lines? Because the people were being robbed and now have the capacity to make purchases," Maduro said during a speech at state oil company PDVSA. Disputes over how much products should cost center on the decade-long exchange controls that provide dollars for imports at the official rate of 6.3 bolivars, even though greenbacks on an illegal black market now fetch more than 9 times that. Government leaders say stores such as Daka acquire cheap dollars and then sell goods priced at the black market rate. Business leaders say the currency controls are not providing enough hard currency, forcing many into the black market. ELECTIONS LOOM Shortages of consumer goods and soaring inflation have made the economy an increasingly important concern for Venezuelans, who on December 8 will vote for mayors in municipal elections. Maduro's campaign may help fire up his base in the run-up to that vote, which will be crucial for the ruling Socialist Party to maintain its control over the provinces. "They say we're looters, but I just want to buy my family a nice television at a fair price for Christmas," said Luciano Alves, 29, a bakery worker in line at an electronics store. "What's wrong with that? It's time to do something about speculation. I say we need a strong hand!" Maduro calls the problems a product of an "economic war" backed by opposition leaders and adversaries in Washington. He has vowed to step up inspections of private businesses in the coming days to ensure they sell goods at "fair prices." Critics say the situation is the result of a corruption-plagued exchange control system, a vast expansion of monetary liquidity, and intrusive regulations that limit productivity by stifling domestic industry. The weekend was marred by looting in at least one establishment in the city of Valencia, where dozens of people were caught on camera running out of a well-known electronics outlet with flat-screen TVs and boxes. The country's chief state prosecutor on Monday night said 50 prosecutors had been assigned to focus on usury crimes. "Some of the headlines over the weekend related to government intervention in certain retail outlets, and subsequent reports of looting, seemed like a taste of a much less manageable social and political backdrop," said J.P. Morgan in a research note circulated on Tuesday. It said it moved Venezuela from "overweight" to "neutral" in its EMBIG emerging market portfolio, for a variety of reasons. The OPEC nation's high-yielding bonds have for years been a lucrative bet for investors despite the strident anti-capitalist rhetoric of late socialist leader Hugo Chavez.

The emergence of democracies in former dictatorships, theocracies, and aristocracies is widely considered evidence of humanity‚Äôs progress towards superior social organization. From an economic standpoint, democracies for all their quibbling still consistently demonstrate the following strengths (hat tip,¬†Dani Rodrik, Harvard University): What do we do then, with Kirchnerism? In many circles, President Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner is pinned up as the primary source of Argentina‚Äôs many woes. And while she is miles away from blameless, Cristina is possibly even further from the root of Argentina‚Äôs cyclical and seemingly inescapable economic demise. She is nothing more than the current face of Peronism, a political and economic model that vastly limits her alternatives. Wikipedia1945‚Ä≤s descamisados appear better groomed than the majority of men I‚Äôve spotted in Puerto MaderoPeronism was thrust onto the main stage of Argentine politics on¬†October 17, 1945, and is based on the social and economic inclusion of the poor. The symbology that surrounds Peronism‚Äôs birth is essential in understanding how Argentina arrived to it‚Äôs current predicament. On that hot October day over fifty years ago, Juan Domingo Per√≥n‚Äôs poor and working class supporters mobilized in a group of over 300,000 in the Plaza de Mayo to demand their leader‚Äôs release from prison. These workers fought the heat by taking off their shirts, earning the name¬†descamisados¬†(shirtless) and cooling their hot feet in the fountain of the Plaza (or putting¬†las patas in la fuente). It goes without saying that shirtless, shoeless workers were not a sight seen before in front of Argentina‚Äôs presidential palace. Per√≥n was famous for rolling up his sleeves to show his supporters that he was one of them. He traveled Argentina in a train called ‚ÄúEl¬†Descamisado‚Äù,¬†gaining supporters throughout the country leading up to his election to President in 1946. Peronism as an ideology is controversial to define, but inarguably is underpinned by thetenant¬†tenet of helping the poor. Per√≥n introduced universal social security, fully government-subsidized education, fully government-subsidized medical care, mandatory paid vacations, mandatory maternity leave, government-subsidized low-income housing, and many other social programs aimed at bettering the lives of the country‚Äôs poorest citizens. Please note the use of the term ‚Äúgovernment-subsidized‚Äù rather than free, because it could not be more relevant today in Argentina. Per√≥n succeeded politically by identifying with the poor and working classes, but he mismanaged and indeed abused how this idea matured. Rather than elevating the poor by recognizing and nurturing their human dignity, he laid the groundwork for a culture based on a lie ‚Äì the dignity of poverty. Government measures to help the poor must be designed to lift people out of poverty in a sustainable manner, period. ¬†Instead, Peronism and its successor Kirchnerism blame the rich for the plight of the poor and provide expensive and unsustainable handouts to ameliorate the experience. Peronism has not only taken root in the hearts and minds of the people, it is very firmly entrenched within the political system itself. In addition to winning the votes of an electorate dependent on the government for subsistence, Argentina‚Äôs leader must face what can only be described as the feudal system of Buenos Aires Province. The province is home to 15 million people, over a third of the entire population, and is divided into roughly 135 municipalities, each governed by a loyal Peronist¬†feudal lord¬†mayor. Put simply, you cannot govern Argentina without the support of Buenos Aires Province, and the Buenos Aires Province will only support a Peronist leader. Fernando de la R√∫a, who served after Menem in 1999, serves as an example of this political reality. The mayors of the Buenos Aires Province have the ability to make an elected official incapable of governing and ensure the failure of any non-Peronist until he quits and Peronism returns.¬† The visible effects of Argentina‚Äôs economic mismanagement, namely inflation, unemployment, and multiple exchange rates, are the unavoidable outcomes of unsustainable and expensive measures Argentina‚Äôs leaders must either maintain or risk losing power. MDB & InfoBAEPeronism today has evolved into something that looks like a class struggle that pits the poor against the rich without explaining why. Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner is viewed by supporters as a Robin Hood-esque character (and not just because they both wear tights to work.) She snatches wealth from the greedy hands of domestic and international fat cats in business and redistributes it into the hands of needy mothers with hungry children, and protects Argentines from destructive foreign interests. But what happens when the fat cats go home, or run out of money? Argentina‚Äôs government can pull resources from the following places:¬† It boils down to the basic concept of spending more money than you can make, and cutting off long-term sources of potential financing in order to make short term ends meet. Businesses have been fleeing Argentina since 2010 due to impossibly high taxes, the inability to repatriate gains, and the inability to acquire imported inputs. Agriculture exporters hoard their products rather than fork over ungodly sums to the government. Foreign investors sit on the sidelines waiting for something to break, and Argentina has to pay extremely high interest rates to lenders. And so they print pesos, fanning the fire of inflation and putting off the inevitable day when the money runs out and the crisis begins. Crisis won‚Äôt hurt the fat cats or the vilified international business interests, it will be borne on the shirtless backs of the workers with their feet in the fountain and their children. These are already the groups feeling the tightening of the noose around Argentina‚Äôs neck as prices rise faster than wages, and fewer jobs are available. And they will be the ones left homeless, sorting through the trash trying to survive in the aftermath no matter what form this particular monster of a crisis happens to take.¬† Political discussions around dinner tables worldwide are stuck on the topic of what happens to Argentina when Cristina goes in 2015. That discussion should instead focus on whether or not Peronism can find and support a leader who will end the dumbing down of the electorate and stop venerating the dignity of poverty. A recent article criticizing the NGO¬†Un Techo Para Mi Pais¬†(a roof for my country) was cleverly-titled¬†Un Cheto Para Mi Pais¬†(a snob for my country). The author smears the middle-class volunteers and their corporate funding for building emergency shelters and calling them homes, and for using the exercise to assuage upper-class guilt and build a positive corporate public image, respectively. The article is exceptionally well-written, and demonstrates to a T one of the fundamental flaws inherent in Peronism. It vilifies businesses that make money and anyone who has money, without any mind to the inescapable reality that it takes money to pay for social programs. Emerging democracies in Latin America will always look different than their counterparts in North America or Europe. Culturally, Latin American countries look for a¬†caudillo, a charismatic and strong leader that can be followed and looked to for every need. The problem is when this¬†caudillo¬†leader becomes a modern Don Quixote, tilting at the windmills of corporate greed and an antiquated concept of the¬†bourgeoisie. ¬† Today in Argentina, it is a reality that democracy will result in Peronist leadership. The question is whether or not that leadership can introduce a modicum of economic common sense into spending on social programs without losing the support of the governed. All eyes are now on Sergio Massa, whose rival Peronist party¬†Frente Renovador¬†(Renewal Front) won over the Kirchnerite Front for Victory (Frente para la Victoria) party in the 2013 midterm elections. Massa denounces export tariffs and doctored economic statistics, but is quiet on the twin elephants in the room named subsidies and social spending. If those elephants are not to trample the country they must either be downsized, or Massa must come up with a sustainable way to feed them. Argentina is heading for a crisis, and the democratically elected Peronist who succeeds Ms. Kirchner will be responsible for picking up the pieces. How this plays out will have implications not just for Argentina, but for democracy in the region as a whole. From a historical perspective, democracy is in its infancy in Latin America. For ideological constructs to take hold, like everything else, they must demonstrate the results that they promise. Democracy is considered government by the people, but the reality on the ground is that it depends heavily on the underlying and often heavily entrenched political institutions. While imperfect ‚Äì like most ‚Äì democracies in Latin America will tend to look different than in other places in the world. They will be led by orators who deliver lengthy, heated discourses to throngs of voters looking for salvation in addition to political leadership. In Argentina, it is the responsibility of Peronist leaders to recognize that while today they are the relatively uncontested will of the people, they have the responsibility to see the bigger picture and address the very real economic problems that are tearing the country apart. Democracy cannot take down Peronism, but Peronism can undermine Argentine democracy.¬†By Bianca Fernet,¬†The Bubble. The black/blue/unofficial ARS/USD rate hit 10/1 again.

www.flickr.comLONDON (Reuters) - The threat of deflation in the euro zone could reverse a major investment trend of 2013, drawing funds out of stocks and into government bonds and cash. Europe is still some way from a negative inflation rate, let alone a Japanese-style deflationary spiral - the policymakers' nightmare in which falling prices weaken demand, leading to wage cuts and even lower prices. But a warning light is already flashing, with euro zone inflation registering a shock drop last month that prompted an interest rate cut. This year's "Great Rotation" flows away from bonds have propelled many stock markets to multi-year or record highs and fuelled a rally in property and other relatively high-yielding assets. But it's a potential money loser in an environment of weak inflation or even outright price declines. With chronic price falls, investors become ultra-risk averse. "Deflation would follow from lower growth than we currently have. It would increase the attraction of fixed income versus equities," said Jan Loeys, JPMorgan's head of asset allocation. There is certainly scope for equities to pull back. The S&amp;P 500 &lt;.SPX&gt; and Dow Jones Industrials &lt;.DJI&gt; have hit record highs in recent weeks. Germany's DAX &lt;.GDAXI&gt; has hit a five-year peak and Japan's Nikkei &lt;.N225&gt; is up 37 percent this year. According to Bank of America-Merrill Lynch, who coined the "Great Rotation" phrase, global equity funds have attracted $231 billion of inflows this year. Bond funds have pulled in just $16 billion, and have posted outflows in12 of the past 14 weeks. Now comes falling inflation. In the euro zone, it slowed to just 0.7 percent last month, well below the European Central Bank's target of below, but close to 2 percent. The ECB halved interest rates to a fresh low of just 0.25 percent as a result. And if inflation falls further, the ECB could act again. This puts it on a potentially divergent path from the U.S. Federal Reserve, which most observers say will begin the process of removing its policy stimulus in the coming months. Deflation alone is not seen as an outright negative for equities, which can still rise if there is moderate growth. But in such an environment, financial stocks tend to underperform because deflation increases a borrower's real debt burden, contributing to higher non-performing loans and lower net interest margins for banks as the gap between short- and long-term interest rates narrows. "If we get a deflation psychology beginning to break out in Europe you have to reconsider the relationship between a 'risk' asset and 'non-risk' asset," said Bill O'Neill, chief UK investment strategist at UBS Wealth Management. "Markets will be focusing on assets that provide nominal guaranteed returns such as government bonds. You would want to be aware of risks in equities, in particular in financials." Investors may already be wary of such risks. European financial stocks &lt;.SX7P&gt; have fallen 1.5 percent this month, making them worst performing sector in Europe. European banks are shrinking their balance sheets as they adjust to new, tighter regulations on risk-taking and capital, as well as drastically weaker demand for loans due to the brittle economy and record high unemployment. The deflationary force of this deleveraging is powerful. As banks lend less, credit creation slows, and so does spending. Morgan Stanley reckons European banks shed 3 trillion euros of assets in the last year, with 1 trillion of that going in the second quarter of this year alone. If financials are among the most vulnerable stocks, high quality euro zone exporters may be best positioned, assuming deflation remains confined to the euro zone. "It's all about pricing power," said Nick Samouilhan, fund manager in the multi-asset team at Aviva. "But equities would not be where you generally want to be," he said. Preferred investments would mostly be cash or government bonds, even taking into account the dynamics in a deflationary environment. Inflation reduces the value of money, lowering the real value of a borrower's debt and the real value of a saver's savings. Inflation tend to be good news for borrowers, but bad for savers. The opposite is the case with deflation. In times of low inflation or deflation, cash and government bonds are relatively "safe" assets that protect an investor's capital and ensure a fixed - if low - rate of return. Within that universe, higher-yielding "peripheral" euro zone debt, such as Spanish and Italian bonds, may be the best bet now that investors have almost priced out default risks. "If there's a dovish shock, peripheral debt will rally," said Salman Ahmed, strategist at Lombard Odier. (Additional reporting by Toni Vorobyova, editing by Nigel Stephenson/Jeremy Gaunt)
BEIJING (AP) ‚Äî General Motors Co. said Wednesday it will move its international headquarters from Shanghai to Singapore, a trophy for the subtropical city-state that is aggressively promoting itself as a global business center. The automaker said in a statement that the new headquarters will have about 120 employees to oversee GM's businesses in Africa, Southeast Asia, Australia, New Zealand, India, South Korea, and the Middle East as well as Chevrolet and Cadillac Europe. GM said it will keep its Shanghai office open with about 250 employees for operations in China, which has overtaken the United States as the world's largest auto market by new vehicle sales. The move, which is slated for the second quarter of next year, would put GM's international head office closer to important markets without undermining its crucial Chinese business. Singapore courts multinational companies by touting advantages such as high quality infrastructure, low crime and ease of doing business. John Zeng, managing director of the forecaster LMC Shanghai Automotive, said Singapore's low corporate tax is an attraction for international companies and GM's Shanghai office "has got too crowded" with several operations there. China's appeal for foreign professionals has been diminished by pollution in cities such as Shanghai and Beijing though GM did not cite that as a reason for the shift. "Singapore would offer closer proximity to our key markets," said Lori Arpin, spokeswoman for GM's international operations. Copyright (2013) Associated Press. All rights reserved.

REUTERS/Finbarr O'ReillyDiamonds lie on a table beside a mobile phone in the town of Koidu, in eastern Sierra Leone April 21, 2012.CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics expects to supply half of the smartphones sold in Africa this year and aims to double these sales on the continent in 2014, an executive said. Africa has a growing young population that is increasingly tech savvy and urbanized. This is attracting foreign sellers of consumer products like smartphones, especially as markets stagnate or shrink in more developed nations. Although smartphones are gaining popularity across the continent, they are still a novelty. At the end of 2012, sub-Saharan smartphone penetration was 4 percent, compared with a global average of 17 percent, according to industry body GSMA. "Samsung this year will ship 50 percent of all the smartphones in Africa," Thabiet Allie, head of content and services for Samsung Electronics Africa, told a telecoms conference in Cape Town late on Tuesday. Out of the 100 million or so mobile phones sold in Africa this year, 20 million are smartphones and slightly more than half of those are models made by the South Korean company, he said. "Next year we are looking at doubling this number and the year after probably doing a substantial increase," Allie said at the annual AfricaCom conference. GSMA forecasts smartphones will constitute 20 percent of the Africa market by 2017 as devices priced at below $50 become a reality. Smartphone use in South Africa is already slightly above the global average, with Blackberry a market leader. One South African company plans to start assembling a $260 smartphone for the African market in 2014. (Reporting by Helen Nyambura-Mwaura; Editing by Pascal Fletcher)

ROSCOE, S.D. (AP) ‚Äî Robert Malsam nearly went broke in the 1980s when corn was cheap. So now that prices are high and he can finally make a profit, he's not about to apologize for ripping up prairieland to plant corn. Across the Dakotas and Nebraska, more than 1 million acres of the Great Plains are giving way to cornfields as farmers transform the wild expanse that once served as the backdrop for American pioneers. This expansion of the Corn Belt is fueled in part by America's green energy policy, which requires oil companies to blend billions of gallons of corn ethanol into their gasoline. In 2010, fuel became the No. 1 use for corn in America, a title it held in 2011 and 2012 and narrowly lost this year. That helps keep prices high. "It's not hard to do the math there as to what's profitable to have," Malsam said. "I think an ethanol plant is a farmer's friend." What the green-energy program has made profitable, however, is far from green. A policy intended to reduce global warming is encouraging a farming practice that actually could worsen it. That's because plowing into untouched grassland releases carbon dioxide that has been naturally locked in the soil. It also increases erosion and requires farmers to use fertilizers and other industrial chemicals. In turn, that destroys native plants and wipes out wildlife habitats. It appeared so damaging that scientists warned that America's corn-for-ethanol policy would fail as an anti-global warming strategy if too many farmers plowed over virgin land. The Obama administration argued that would not happen. But the administration didn't set up a way to monitor whether it actually happened. It did. More than 1.2 million acres of grassland have been lost since the federal government required that gasoline be blended with increasing amounts of ethanol, an Associated Press analysis of satellite data found. Plots that were wild grass or pastureland seven years ago are now corn and soybean fields. That's in addition to the 5 million acres of farmland that had been aside for conservation ‚Äî more than Yellowstone, Everglades and Yosemite National Parks combined ‚Äî that have vanished since Obama took office. In South Dakota, more than 370,000 acres of grassland have been uprooted and farmed from since 2006. In Edmunds County, a rural community about two hours north of the capital, Pierre, at least 42,000 acres of grassland have become cropland ‚Äî one of the largest turnovers in the region. Malsam runs a 13-square-mile family farm there. He grows corn, soybeans and wheat, then rents out his grassland for grazing. Each year, the family converts another 160 acres from grass to cropland. Chemicals kill the grass. Machines remove the rocks. Then tractors plow it three times to break up the sod and prepare it for planting. Scattered among fields of 7-foot tall corn and thigh-high soybeans, some stretches of grassland still exist. Cattle munch on some grass. And "prairie potholes" ‚Äî natural ponds ranging from small pools to larger lakes ‚Äî support a smattering of ducks, geese, pelicans and herons. Yet within a mile of Malsam's farm, federal satellite data show, more than 300 acres of grassland have been converted to soybeans and corn since 2006. Nebraska has lost at least 830,000 acres of grassland, a total larger than New York City, Los Angeles and Dallas combined. "It's great to see farmers making money. It hasn't always been that way," said Craig Cox of the Environmental Working Group. He advocates for clean energy but opposes the ethanol mandate. "If we're going to push the land this hard, we really need to intensify conservation in lockstep with production, and that's just not happening," he said. Jeff Lautt, CEO of Poet, which operates ethanol refineries across the country, including in South Dakota, said it's up to farmers how to use their land. "The last I checked, it is still an open market. And farmers that own land are free to farm their land to the extent they think they can make money on it or whatever purpose they need," he said. Yet Chris Wright, a professor at South Dakota State University who has studied land conversion, said: "The conversation about land preservation should start now before it becomes a serious problem." Wright reviewed the AP's methodology for determining land conversion. The AP's analysis used government satellite data to count how much grassland existed in 2006 in each county, then compare each plot of land to corresponding satellite data from 2012. The data from the U.S. Geological Survey and the Department of Agriculture identify corn and soybean fields. That allowed the AP to see which plots of grassland became cropland. To reach its conservative estimate of 1.2 million acres lost, the AP excluded grassland that had been set aside under the government's Conservation Reserve Program, in which old farmland is allowed to return to a near-natural state. The AP used half-acre sections of earth and excluded tiny tracts that became corn, which experts said were most likely outliers. Corn prices more than doubled in the years after Congress passed the ethanol mandate in 2007. Now, Malsam said, farmers can make about $500 an acre planting corn. His farm has just become profitable in the past five years, allowing him and his wife, Theresa, to build a new house on the farmstead. Four miles south, signs at each end of the town of Roscoe announce a population of only 324. But the town, which relies in part on incomes like Malsam's, supports a school, a restaurant, a bank, a grocery store and a large farm machinery store. The manager of the equipment dealership, Kaleb Rodgers, said the booming farm economy has helped the town and the dealership prosper. The business with 28 employees last year sold a dozen combines at about $300,000 apiece, plus more than 60 tractors worth between $100,000 and $300,000, he said. "If we didn't have any farmers we wouldn't have a community here. We wouldn't have a business. I wouldn't be sitting here. I wouldn't be able to feed my family," Rodgers said. "I think ethanol is a very good thing." Jim Faulstich, president of the South Dakota Grasslands Coalition, said the nation's ethanol and crop insurance policies have encouraged the transformation of the land. Faulstich, who farms and ranches in central South Dakota near Highmore, said much of the land being converted is not suited to crop production, and South Dakota's strong winds and rains will erode the topsoil. "I guess a good motto would be to farm the best and leave the rest," he said. ___ Gillum reported from Washington.

The recovery in the Eurozone continues to underwhelm. From Markit: Markit Markit
Thereís been a lot of bubble talk in recent weeks. †Actually, thereís been a lot of bubble talk in recent years. †The word ìbubbleî gets tossed around an awful lot ever since the Nasdaq bubble and the housing bubble. †I guess itís not that surprising. But first, what is a ìbubbleî? †I define a bubble as follows: ìA bubble is an environment in which the market price of an asset has deviated from the underlying assetís fundamentals to an extent that renders the current market price unstable relative to the underlying assetís ability to deliver the expected result.î So, does the current environment qualify? †Russ Koesterich of BlackRock provides his four reasons why this market is not a bubble: Iím not a big valuation guy and I donít really buy the notion that money ìflows intoî outstanding assets, but I will say that I generally think Russ is right. †When I try to decipher whether a market is in a bubble I donít like to rely on valuation metrics because I think bubbles are often the result of irrational behavior that makes valuation metrics unreliable for long periods of time. †Instead, I prefer to look at underlying fundamentals relative to behavior. † When I look at the current equity market I see corporate profits growing modestly, an economy that is expanding modestly and an equity market that is increasingly enthusiastic, but not showing the types of pure exuberance, greed and delusion that are typical in a bubble environment. †Thereís still a huge amount of skepticism about the equity market rally. †This remains an extremely hated rally. So, I would say thereís growing risk as weíre seeing increasing signs of euphoria, but I wouldnít yet describe this as a ìbubbleî. †I think that implies much more downside risk than is currently present in the economic and corporate fundamentals. †And perhaps more importantly, weíre just not seeing the kind of all out delusion that usually accompanies a bubble. †When people at dinner parties start telling me that stocks canít go down then Iíll start getting scared.

If you're a real estate company in a blazing hot property market, how do you convince people that they don't have to worry about a bubble? Just say so! That's what Dubai firm Propertyfinder did. All kinds of folks have been tweeting and Instagramming this big ad that was on the side of a building (via Owen Callan)   Of course the company says nobody should be reading into the ad one way or another. It's just supposed to be funny, and it is. Well done.
flickr via Vox EfxGood morning. There's a bit of red on the board, pretty much across the world this morning. US futures are off a bit. Stock indices in Europe are all lower (Italy down 0.4%, Germany down 0.2%). Shanghai really hit pretty hard, falling nearly 2%. Korea was down 1.6%. Japan was down a tad. There's nothing especially big going on. Things remain quite quiet as there's been pretty much no news, nor has there been any significant central bank action of note this week. Should probably remain fairly quiet for the rest of the week.
