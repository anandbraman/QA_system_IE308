Thomson ReutersA shadow of a man using his mobile phone is cast near Microsoft logo at the 2014 Computex exhibition in TaipeiSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp  is demanding $6.9 million interest from Samsung Electronics  in a dispute over smartphone patent royalties, according to a lawsuit unsealed by a New York federal court on Friday. Microsoft is asking the court to rule that it did not breach a business collaboration agreement with Samsung, and that Samsung must pay interest on more than $1 billion in royalty payments which it delayed in protest at Microsoft's planned purchase of rival Nokia's handset business. A redacted version of the lawsuit was filed by Microsoft in August. Samsung made royalty payments on time to Microsoft during the first fiscal year after they signed their 2011 agreement, the lawsuit said. However, after Microsoft announced the Nokia deal in September 2013, Samsung initially refused to make another payment, arguing that the Nokia deal breached its licensing agreement with Microsoft. It eventually paid late without adding interest, according to the lawsuit. Samsung did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday. Microsoft has successfully argued that Google Inc's  Android mobile system uses some of its technology, and as a result most hardware makers, including Samsung, have agreed to pay patent royalties on Android handsets. Motorola is one of the main holdouts, and that company has been in litigation against Microsoft since 2010. The lawsuit in U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York is Microsoft Corp vs. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, 14-6039.

REUTERS/Marcos Brindicci ">Thomson ReutersArgentina's President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner gestures during a ceremony at the Casa Rosada Presidential Palace in  Buenos AiresNEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge said on Friday Argentina must reverse the steps it has taken to evade his orders in a longstanding dispute with hedge funds over debt the country defaulted on in 2002. In a rare move, District Judge Thomas Griesa held Argentina in contempt earlier this week, saying its attempts to pay holders of the bonds it restructured in 2005 and 2010 debt swaps locally were "illegal." The judge prevented Argentina in June from making a coupon payment to exchange bondholders because of his earlier ruling that the South American country could only do so if it paid the U.S. "holdout" funds, who rejected the swaps, at the same time. The move plunged Latin America's third largest economy into its second default in 12 years. Leftist President Cristina Fernandez's government responded by enacting a law removing trustee Bank of New York Mellon Corp and allowing the country to make payments locally to keep the money beyond Griesa's reach. "Argentina will need to reverse entirely the steps which it has taken constituting the contempt, including, but not limited to, re-affirming the role of The Bank of New York Mellon as the indenture trustee," Griesa said in an order, noting this was what it would take to purge his contempt finding. Defiant, the country this week deposited a $161 million bond interest payment with a newly appointed local trustee, state-controlled Nacion Fideicomisos. Griesa, who has overseen litigation in New York over Argentina's debt for years, said on Friday the country must "(withdraw) any purported authorization of Nacion Fideicomisos, S.A. to act as the indenture trustee." The judge's decision to hold a foreign government in civil contempt of court is a rare but not unprecedented move. In typical cases, U.S. judges can hold parties in contempt and issue sanctions to force compliance. The hedge funds had proposed a daily fine of $50,000. However, Argentina might simply ignore any monetary sanction. Griesa has not set a specific schedule to consider sanctions.  (Reporting by Nate Raymond in New York. Writing by Sarah Marsh.

APA tug boat passes by the Russian luxury cruise liner 'Maxim Gorkiy' in a dry dock of the Blohm+Voss shipyards in Hamburg, northern Germany.A decade of lawsuits promoted in the UK courts by Sovcomflot’s chief executive, Sergei Frank, has ended disastrously with a judgement issued against him and his company in the High Court today. Justice Andrew Smith has ruled in favour of Yury Nikitin, Sovcomflot’s chartering partner before Frank took over the state-owned shipping concern in 2004. The judgement singles out Frank, and Sovcomflot’s lawyer, Vladimir Mednikov; and charges them with dishonesty, fabrication of evidence, illegal information gathering, lying to the court, and with having been “seriously and culpably in breach of their duties.” text. Click to read the full text. The judgement orders Sovcomflot back into court for an assessment of the damages that must now be paid to Nikitin. A court hearing will follow to consider expert evidence on the amount to be paid to Nikitin. Based on Smith’s ruling today, sources close to the case expect this will be “in excess of $180 million”. The sum is so large that, if confirmed, it may wipe out Sovcomflot’s profit for this year and next. According to Sovcomflot’s latest financial report, the company ran a loss of $39.2 million in 2013. In the six months to June 30, 2014, the bottom line showed a profit of $63.6 million. Until now Sovcomflot has told its auditors, Ernst &amp; Young, to set aside no provision for any court order in Nikitin’s favour. “Management is of the opinion”, the company declared August 28, “that the claimed amount is speculative and the likelihood of this claim being successful is remote”. According to Justice Smith, who has been presiding in the complex litigation since 2009, Frank gave “dishonest evidence”, and was responsible for the improper penalties which have been imposed on Nikitin until now. Smith has also exonerated Frank’s predecessors at the state shipping group, Dmitry Skarga and Tagir Izmailov. They, along with Nikitin, have been shielded by the UK Government from prosecution in Russia on claims the UK courts have dismissed. Although their names are not mentioned, Smith’s 25-page judgement is an implied rebuke to the two men identified in the original High Court witness testimony as having fabricated the case in the first place for their own commercial advantage, and given Frank the backing of Russian police and prosecutors in their fabrications. They are Igor Sechin and Gennady Timchenko.  Both are now on the current international sanctions lists of the US government and the European Union. For the court evidence of their role, with Frank, in the Sovcomflot affair, read this. Frank has not joined Sechin and Timchenko on the sanctions list. But his family has been hit. Gleb Frank, Sergei’s son, is the husband of Timchenko’s daughter; Ksenia, she is an executive at the Timchenko-owned company, Transoil, which carries crude oil to port, and a board member of a Timchenko family foundation. Transoil was sanctioned by the US on April 28. Gleb Frank is Timchenko’s stand-in as control shareholder at Russian Sea Group (RSG), a leading fishing fleet operator and fish importer. Timchenko bought into RSG in July 2011 through his investment holding, Volga Resources. Volga is also on the US sanctions list. How Frank Junior came to fish in these troubled waters was reported here. Frank also represents Timchenko’s shareholding on the boards of Stroitransgaz, a builder of oil and gas pipelines, and Akvanika, a bottled water vendor; both companies have also been sanctioned by the US. The first London court judgement by Justice Smith against Sergei Frank was reported in December 2010; the second in March 2011. Both have been upheld by the Court of Appeal, and the Supreme Court. According to the Court of Appeal, Frank’s litigation was “vindictive”. All subsequent efforts by Frank, Sechin, Timchenko, and government officials Igor Shuvalov and Sergei Naryshkin, to privatize the shipping company and sell shares on an international stock exchange have collapsed. In today’s ruling, Smith acknowledged that he had already found against Nikitin on some of Sovcomflot’s allegations of bribery in obtaining charter and ship construction contracts. But he ruled that those findings were dwarfed by Frank’s misconduct and that of his London lawyers. “In my assessment the impropriety of the claimants [Sovcomflot] who obtained the 2005 orders and the 2007 orders was such that it would be wrong not to enforce the undertaking [for payment of damages to Nikitin] even if I take account of all the misconduct of which the claimants complain.” Sovcomflot had applied for the High Court orders at the start of the litigation in order to freeze bank accounts and assets of Nikitin and his shipping companies. According to Smith, the value frozen over almost a decade came to $486.5 million. According to Nikitin, the orders were improperly issued because Sovcomflot and its lawyers “were guilty of misrepresentation and non-disclosure when they obtained them.” At the time the freeze commenced, the High Court warned Sovcomflot that “if the court later finds that this order has caused loss to the respondent [Nikitin] and decides that the respondent should be compensated for that loss, the applicants [Sovcomflot] will comply with any order the court may make.” An independent calculation cited by the judge indicates that one part of the damages, the smaller part dating from 2005, comes to at least $69 million. The judge has also called for the damages to be estimated for the 2007 order. Nikitin’s claim is for $184 million. This is now likely to be revised above $200 million. The damages are high because of the length of time Sovcomflot kept the assets out of Nikitin’s control through the course of the litigation, and because of what the judge labelled “culpable” manipulation of the evidence in the case. “The claimants [Sovcomflot] were in breach of their duty to make proper disclosure and not to avoid misrepresentation. In my judgment they were in material and culpable breach both in 2005 and in 2007. The claimants did not disclose when they obtained the 2005 orders: i) That, as the board minutes recorded, many of the transactions of which they complained, had been considered by and were carried out with the approval of the Executive Board of Sovcomflot. ii) That Sovcomflot had had the wrongdoing of which they complained by investigators who had, to their knowledge, used unlawful methods to obtain information”. Sovcomflot, Smith ruled, deliberately concealed the company’s records from the court “as is evidenced by the extent of their efforts to present at trial untruthful evidence to explain away the [board] minutes”. There has been no comment yet from Sovcomflot’s spokesmen in London and Moscow on the condemnation or the liability. Nikitin and his lawyers are also making no comment. Sovcomflot’s lawyers have conceded in court that they will not appeal Smith’s latest judgement. They will try instead to persuade the court to cut the award below $200 million.

tehrantimes.comThe U.S. benchmark oil price dipped below a key threshold Thursday: $90 a barrel. Global demand is soft, and on the supply side the world seems awash in petroleum. That’s put some key supplier countries in a tough position, with some choosing a potential price war. On Wednesday, Saudi Arabia’s national oil company indicated it's still pumping — and selling at a discount to customers. “They cut those prices across the board,” says HIS Energy analyst Jamie Webster. “And in particular they have cut them very sharply for Asia.” It reflects a changing world. In the words of a frequently cited 2012 report from Citibank, North America may be a new Middle East. Citi co-author Seth Kleinman says oil fields in Texas and North Dakota pump so much oil, U.S. imports have fallen by 3 million barrels per day over the past nine years. “You used to have a big home for OPEC oil on the U.S. gulf coast,” Kleinman says. “The U.S. Gulf Coast is completely jammed. So Asia is really all you’ve got left.” In the fight for market share, OPEC producers seem to be scrambling with everyone else. It could all push prices down even more. That’s good for American drivers, not so good for American drillers if prices fall from $90 to the mid-$80s, according to several analysts. “Clearly in the U.S. markets, what you would see is cutting back on investments, specifically on drilling and fracking,” says Quantum Reservoir Impact consultant Nansen Saleri, formerly of the Saudi national oil company. Saleri notes American oil is comparatively expensive to produce. So if prices fall further, he says, some U.S. drillers would struggle and North American output would likely decline.

YouTube / PIMCOBill GrossBOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors hope the Bond King can remake himself as a team player. Bill Gross last week abruptly left Newport Beach, California-based Pimco, the firm he built into a bond giant, to join Janus Capital Group &lt;jns.n&gt;, a small Denver firm that touts on its website how its friendly, team-oriented culture creates "strong collaborators." While investors are certainly excited about the move - Janus shares are up 30 percent since the announcement - some wonder just how much easily the outspoken, 70-year-old Gross will fit in at the firm led by Pimco veteran Richard Weil. Weil hired Gross at the urging of former Pimco chief executive officer Bill Thompson, according to two people familiar with the matter. But Janus already has a bond leader in Gibson Smith, who has less star power than Gross but has quietly delivered better performance in recent years. He is said to work well with Janus CEO Weil, and has emphasized a team approach, which could be a contrast with the autocratic style that Gross showed at Pimco. Kevin Mahn, who helps manage $2 billion as chief investment officer at Hennion &amp; Walsh, a Parsippany, New Jersey-based wealth management firm, questions if Gross can co-exist with Smith and how much oversight Gross may face. "It's setting the stage for a culture clash," Mahn said. "Here's a guy who was at rock-star status, and Pimco was synonymous with his name. Now he's moving to a different firm and he's not necessarily going to be the same person as he was," Mahn said. Michael Cuggino, president of the $7.5 billion Permanent Portfolio Family of Funds in San Francisco, which owns Janus shares, said Weil and the rest of Janus' management will be judged in part on how smoothly Gross transitions to their firm. Key will be for Gross to show he can work well with others and for Janus to avoid the bad publicity that marred Gross's last months at Pimco, including his falling-out with his one-time successor Mohamed El-Erian, who left earlier this year. "If they bring in Gross and it's a disaster and all over the front pages because they didn't get along, like with El-Erian, that's not good," Cuggino said. Gross has been famously short-tempered at work, slamming desk drawers and discouraging socializing. He once fumed at an employee for attending an industry conference: "I don't want you to attend the conference, I want you to be a speaker at the conference." Janus will report third-quarter results on Oct. 23. Weil had been Pimco's chief operating officer for ten years before joining Janus in 2010. Weil and Gross "were never soul mates the way he was with Mohamed," said John Brynjolfsson, chief investment officer of hedge fund Armored Wolf in Irvine, California, and a former managing director at Pimco from 1989 to 2008. "There was never that chemistry. It's not like they would form a coalition after their time at Pimco or see them going on vacations together," Brynjolfsson said. Gross has not been available for interviews, nor has Thompson. Smith has declined interview requests as have other Janus executives including Weil. A Janus spokesman said on Friday that Gross will report directly to Weil. In press statements issued on Sept 26, the day Gross's move was announced, Janus said he will remain in Newport Beach and will take over the $13 million Janus Unconstrained Bond Fund, which will change its name to the Janus Global Unconstrained Bond Fund &lt;jucax.o&gt;. Gross also will work up some related business that "will be separate and complementary" to Smith's, Janus said. Gross isn't wasting time in jumping in: he will release his first outlook with Janus, titled "Stayin' Alive," on Oct. 9, after a webcast for institutional investors with Weil on the global unconstrained bond strategy, according to an invitation to the event seen by Reuters on Friday.   SMALL BUT NIMBLE Smith, who is keeping his title as Janus' fixed income chief investment officer, will focus on corporate bonds while Gross will stick with the "macro" role he played at Pimco making big-picture bets on interest rates and the global economy. A half-dozen people who have worked with Smith or know him well say he collaborates closely with a group of analysts and traders, many of whom he recruited since he became Janus' bond chief in 2006. These people said Weil and Smith work well together. Smith runs a smaller bond operation at Janus, with $31.4 billion in assets at June 30, compared with the $222 billion that Gross oversaw at Pimco Total Return Fund &lt;pttrx.o&gt; alone. Yet Smith’s steady returns compare favorably to Gross' recent uneven performance. The Janus Flexible Bond Fund, the firm's biggest bond fund at $7.1 billion, has earned a 3.85 percent return this year through Sept. 30. This compared with the Pimco Total Return Fund's 3.33 percent return over the same period. The Janus fund has also outperformed by a similar level over a five-year period, according to data from Lipper, a Thomson Reuters unit.        Janus shares initially shot up 43 percent on Sept 26, hitting a 52-week high of $15.95 after the Gross announcement. They closed at $14.49 on Friday, up 30 percent from before Gross joined the firm. In a report issued Oct. 2 Morningstar analyst Sumit Desai wrote that Janus will need to provide enough support such as traders, research analysts portfolio managers for Gross to handle an influx of investor cash. Janus will never likely provide as much support as Pimco, Desai wrote, "raising the question of how successful Gross can be with fewer resources."     (Reporting by Ross Kerber in Boston, and by Richard Leong and Jennifer Ablan in New York; additional reporting by Luciana Lopez.

Herbalife is down 40% since its peak in January of 2014, and while the headlines have been Bill Ackman vs. Carl Ichan, there's something else that's going on with the company... and that "something" may very well be driving the stock price.HLF has the second worst net income shrinkage (one-year) and the second worst earnings margin % relative to peers.We'll look at four financial measures, with trends and some peer comparisons, but here's the Pièce de résistance. The chart below shows Herbalife's stock price is orange and net income (earnings) in blue.Before we dig deeper into the financial measures, let's look at the stock chart from January 21st (stock peak in 2014) to the present.We can see the stock has had some ups and down, but bottom line: it's down 40% from its peak... and it ain't Bill Ackman and Carl Icahn that are moving the price over the long-term.Total RevenueSo this is a beautiful chart... and the one bulls will point to (quite rightly).  Revenue growth has been spectacular and consistent... has it been too "consistent"?Net IncomeEarnings have been rising abruptly for HLF from essentially a break even firm back in 2005 to a firm with over half a billion dollars in net income.  But... we see a down trend. Now, these are trailing-twelve-month composites so the trend isn't so cut and dry.  here are the last four quarters of net income from the most recent to the least, respectively: So it's not a straight line, but the last two quarters are lower than any of the two quarters prior.Net Income MarginThis is a more indicative measure since the downtrend has lasted well over two-years.  The bottom line is, Herbalife earnings margins are decreasing even though revenue are increasing.Net Income vs. Net Income MarginSo far everything we've looked at has been in a vacuum... which is to say, it has been focused on Herbalife alone. If we plot Net Income Margin on the x-axis and Net Income Growth (1-year) on the y-axis, and allow the scatter to include HLF's peers, we see the problem.  HLF has the second worst net income shrinkage (one-year) and the second worst earnings margin. Billionaires may agree to disagree... but a firm with shrinking earnings and poor margins doesn't need investors famous for being rich to do anything... it needs a turnaround in the company's operations.

FlickrFA Insights is a daily newsletter from Business Insider that delivers the top news and commentary for financial advisors. Financial Advisors Are Losing Confidence In The Slowing Market (Wealth Management.com) The Advisor Confidence Index dropped 1% — to 115.69 — in September, which continues "the slow erosion of advisor optimism in the markets and the economy," according to Wealthmanagement.com. Although numbers above 100 signify "overall optimism," the continued downwards trend is worrying. Since the beginning of the year, confidence has fallen 7% from a high of 123.02. Advisors believe that geopolitical uncertainty, the end of quantitative easing, and mid-term elections are the forces behind equity volatility. Many advisors believe that the market is due for a correction, according to Wealthmanagement.com "The expected correction still has not arrived," said Edward Kohlhepp Sr. of Kohlhepp Investment Advisors. "The train is late to the station, but it still might arrive." Convertible Bonds Should Be Part Of The Equity Allocation, Not Fixed Income Portfolio (Charles Schwab) Convertible bonds have generated a year-to-date total return of 7.8% through September 26, compared to 8.9% for the S&amp;P 500 Index. Last year, the convertible bond index returns 24.4%, compared to a loss of 2% for the aggregate bond index. "But don't let that strong performance fool you — convertible bonds are very susceptible to sell-offs, just like stocks. In 2008 the total return of the Barclays US Convertibles Composite Index was -34.7% — even worse than the return of the Barclays Corporate High-Yield Bond Index," warns Collin Martin. Overall, convertible bonds have lower yields than traditional corporate bonds. But if stock prices rise, then they have the potential to generate higher returns. "We think investors looking for higher yields are generally better off in non-convertible corporate bonds. And if investors are looking at convertible bonds because of the potential for higher returns from rising stock prices, we think this should come from the equity allocation of an investor's overall portfolio, not the fixed income allocation," writes Martin. Avoid Sales Of Appreciated Stocks To Reduce Tax On Investment Income (AllianceBernstein) In order to reduce tax on investment income, investors should avoid selling appreciated stocks held less than one year, writes Tara Thopmson Popernik. "Capital gains on the sale of stocks held for more than a year are taxed at a lower, long-term capital gains rate than gains on the sale of stocks held a year or less. By waiting to sell a position at a gain until it has been held for more than year, a top-bracket taxpayer can reduce the tax bit from 43.4% to 23.8%. Investors in lower tax brackets who wait sometimes can entirely eliminate the tax on a capital gain," Popernik writes. Even if the stock starts to decline, it pays to wait on selling. The amount by which a stock declines could be less than the tax amount for stocks held less than one year. To Keep Clients, Avoid Acting Like A Narcissist (Advisor Perspectives) "It's quite easy for investment advisors (especially male advisors) to be perceived as narcissists, whether or not they actually meet the clinical critera. For example, they have expertise, which may cause them to feel superior to prospects and clients. If an advisor has achieved success, this may reinforce his or her belief that he or she is unique," writes Dan Solin. "When dealing with prospects, these advisors can exhibit behavior that is typically associated with narcissism. They dominate conversations, believing that what they are saying is vastly more important than the views of the prospect. They impatiently wait for opportunities to interrupt the prospect so they can reassert their role. They believe they can charm their way into sales, because of their innate charisma," writes Solin. Unfortunately, this behavior is off-putting to clients. Instead of constantly lecturing from a dominant position, advisors should try to have a conversation with their client. Additionally, some "narcissistic" advisors believe that clients are "insulting them" when they ask questions, but clients are simply worried about their financial futures. Financial Advisors Looking To Mimic Hedge Funds Should First Understand Their Strategies (Financial Planning) The market is slowing down and volatility is increasing, which could make hedge funds an interesting option for advisors. However the long/short returns are "especially unpredictable" because these funds greatly vary their strategies. Advisors should look at the specific hedge funds to understand their strategies before copying their moves. One thing to look at is the role of cash at each specific hedge fund. "A large cash position in a long/short strategy that holds futures may indicate an aggressive portfolio strategy. The fund's investor information will disclose if cash is held as collateral against futures positions," writes Margo Eprecht.  Other mangers use cash to control market exposure. For example, AllianceBernstein's ASLAX held "almost a third of its assets in cash at the end of July. The fund was up a little more than 1% through August."  "If we don't see a lot of opportunity on the short side, we carry cash instead," said Alliance's lead portfolio manager Kurt Feuerman. Each fund has its own strategy and goals, so blindly copying them could have adverse effects on a portfolio. FREE AppDownload

While deindustrialization is still taking place in many parts of the US, it's worth looking at a historical perspective. A new Dallas Fed study points out the long-term evolution of the structure of the US economy. This chart shows the share of employment in the US in agriculture, industry, and the service sector going back to 1850:Dallas Fed Back in the nineteenth century, the US economy was mostly built on agriculture. Over the next century, agricultural jobs went into decline as more efficient farming technologies meant that far fewer people were needed to grow ever more food. Meanwhile, the share of industrial jobs would more than double, and then begin to decline in the 1960s. The service sector's share of employment consistently grew, and by the start of the 21st century, about four in five jobs in America are service jobs. The authors pointed out how this is a pretty standard development cycle. As economies grow, industry takes up an increasing share of employment, for a while, but then starts to take a back seat as the economy matures and the service sector takes over: Dallas Fed FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Eduardo MunozThe 740 Park Avenue.Major cities like New York are seeing surging, sky-high rental prices. But the New York metro area property market isn't greater for investors who want to buy a place and rent it out for income. A new report by RealtyTrac ranked US housing markets by gross rental yield, which is "the average fair market rent of three-bedroom homes in each county, annualized, and divided by the median sales price of residential properties in the third quarter." Among America's big metro areas, New York came in last place. The gross rental yield averaged just 2.40% in Q3. By comparison, smaller markets — like Rocky Mount, North Carolina — offer gross rental yields up to 41.57%. In these markets, investors could earn huge amounts of income on their investments. It's important to note that in this report the New York metro area encompasses New York City, Northern New Jersey, Long Island, and Pennsylvania — not only Manhattan. Plus, this data looks at the yield rates, and not the exact dollar-value of return. While the New York metro area has the lowest annual return rate, the dollar-value of this return may still be incredibly high since you have to access to much more volume. FREE AppDownload
U.S. Air ForceA member of the Air Force Special Operations Command’s, Special Tactics Training Squadron strains while lifting weights during a strength and conditioning session at Hurlburt Field, Florida.Stocks rallied on Friday after a jobs report that showed nonfarm payrolls grew more than expected in September while the unemployment rate fell below 6% for the first time since July 2008. First, the scoreboard: And now, the top stories on Friday: 1. The jobs report was a blowout. Nonfarm payrolls grew by 248,000 in September better than the 215,000 that was expected by Wall Street economists and better than the 142,000 gain last month. August's numbers were revised higher to 180,000. The unemployment rate also fell to 5.9%, the first time the unemployment rate has fallen below 6% since July 2008, and better than expectations for the unemployment rate to remain unchanged at 6.1%. Wage growth was the piece of the jobs report that disappointed, however, with wages flat month-over-month and up 2% year-over-year, below expectations for gains of 0.2% and 2.2%, respectively.  2. A much-watched piece of the jobs report, the labor force participation rate, also fell to its lowest level since 1978. The labor force participation rate fell to 62.7% from 62.8% in August, and the decline in the labor force has been one of the most hotly debated questions in economics. As Business Insider's Andy Kiersz wrote on Friday: "On the one hand, America is aging, and the baby boomers are beginning to retire. That leads to a natural demographic decline in the participation rate.... On the other hand, the US is coming out of the worst recession it has faced in decades, and the participation rate dropped much more sharply since 2008. The cyclical effects from the recession may also be a big factor in the declining participation rate." 3. Stocks rallied on Friday, with all of the major averages gaining more than 1%. The averages, however, still finished the week with losses in what was a choppy week of trade. There was a rash of economic data this week, and when it was all said and done, Drew Matus at UBS wrote in a note to clients that simply: "Sometimes good news is good news." Matus wrote that Q3 GDP now appears to be tracking about 0.5% above his initial 3.2% annualized growth expectation, with consumer spending appearing to have accelerated, fixed business investment improved, and the labor market appearing solid.  4. Commodities continued to take a beating this week, as crude oil fell below $90 a barrel for the first time this year and gold continued to fall. Gold fell below $1200 an ounce on Friday, and is now near its worst level of the year as the entire commodity space continues to be under pressure.  5. Wall Street veteran analyst Brad Hintz announced that he is leaving Sanford Bernstein, where he has been one of the top financial sector analysts for the last 13 years. Hintz was considered a "go-to" analysts for comment on the big banks, and is leaving Bernstein, which is also terminating coverage of capital markets banks and investment banking boutiques, to take a position at NYU's Stern School.  6. Stocks in the "Ebola trade" had a big day after a report from CNN said that a patient was admitted to a Washington, D.C.-area hospital with Ebola-like symptoms. Some of the big gainers from this trade include Tekmira and BioCryst, which are developing Ebola treatments, and Sarepta Pharmaceuticals, which develops treatments for rare diseases.  7. Also on the economic data front, America's oil deficit fell to its lowest level in 10 years as the US balance of trade unexpectedly narrowed in August, to $40.1 billion from $40.4 billion in July. Following the report, Ian Shepherdson at Pantheon Macro said the report was "flattered by oil exports," but added that the trade deficit will make a "hefty" contribution to Q3 GDP, which he expects to come in at 3.5%.  8. A late afternoon report in The Wall Street Journal said that Yahoo wants to invest in Snapchat as part of a fundraising round that values the vanishing picture app at $10 billion.  Don't Miss: Here's How To Do Warren Buffett's Favorite Critical Thinking Exercise » FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Jo Yong-Hak Warren Buffett wins the trophy for critical thinking. Here's one way he does his training.The Sage of Omaha has a ridiculously fit mind — anything he says becomes news.   While Buffett's brain is constantly working to crank through books, play bridge, and lobby Congress, the man is also deliberate about doing mental weightlifting.  Bill Gates — a close friend of the investor — recounted in a 1996 Fortune column an exercise Buffett liked to do in critical thinking. It's part of how their friendship started. "On that first day, [Buffett] introduced me to an intriguing analytic exercise that he does," Gates said. "He'll choose a year — say, 1970 — and examine the 10 highest market-capitalization companies from around then. Then he'll go forward to 1990 and look at how those companies fared. His enthusiasm for the exercise was contagious." Pretty cool, right? With this exercise, you can practice spotting trends, analyze why some companies sustain success while others slip, and how technology advances and cultural norms shape business. We did a version of this exercise, comparing the market leaders over a 20-year interval. We looked at 1990 and 2010, using information provided to us by Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.  Here are the 10 largest market-cap companies of 1990:  1. IBM ($64.53 billion)2. Exxon ($64.49 billion) 3. GE ($50.34 billion)4. Philip Morris ($47.89 billion)5. Royal Dutch Petrol ($42.15 billion) 6. Bristol-Myers Squibb ($35.2 billion)7. Merck &amp; Co ($34.81 billion)8. Wal-Mart Stores ($34.26 billion)9. AT&amp;T ($32.8 billion)10. Coca-Cola ($31.05 billion) And the 10 largest market-cap companies of 2010:  1. Exxon Mobil ($368.71 billion)2. Apple Inc. ($295.89 billion)3. Microsoft ($238.79 billion)4. Berkshire Hathaway ($198.03 billion)5. GE ($194.88 billion)6. Wal-Mart Stores ($192.1 billion)7. Google ($189.94 billion)8. Chevron ($183.64 billion)9. IBM ($182.32 billion)10. Procter &amp; Gamble ($180.07 billion) Summoning our inner Buffett, let's look at the overall shifts. Four companies — IBM, Exxon, GE, and Wal-Mart — stayed on top, while six fell off. Over the same period, several new entrants — Apple, Google, and Microsoft — claimed top spots.  There are a few takeaways. First, changes in culture can lay waste to a consumer goods empire. Tobacco maker Philip Morris was gigantic back in 1990 when smoking was a popular habit, but legislation has deeply cut into its business. California rolled out the first smoking ban in 1995, starting a state-by-state trend that's curbed Philip Morris' dominance. And having all those Marlboro Men die of smoking-related diseases didn't help much, either.  Second, major corporations can sustain themselves if they stay "agile," as management experts like to say. GE has been so innovative for so long that it's shaped a lot of modern life. Thomas Edison's company kept it up into the new century, coming out with medical breakthroughs like high-definition brain scans and cancer detection devices. And while IBM slipped from its No. 1 rank as the world's most valuable company in 1990, the computing behemoth successfully moved into China and other emerging markets, and hopped onto massive trends in tech like cloud computing, bringing in billions in revenue.  Third, monopolistic companies can stay dominant if their market stays stable. Wal-Mart has presided over American low-cost retail for decades now, and the company shows no signs of slipping. Like billionaire investor Peter Thiel says, the monopoly is the finest form of capitalism. If you have more observations, tell us in the comments.  FREE AppDownload
ReutersBrazil's presidential candidates Dilma Rousseff (L) of Workers Party (PT) and Marina Silva of Brazilian Socialist Party (PSB) take part in a TV debate in Rio de Janeiro October 2, 2014. Brazil will be be holding its general elections on October 5, to elect the country's National Congress, president, state governors and state legislatures.On Sunday Brazilians will take to the polls for the first round of their Presidential elections. At this point the outcome is basically a foregone conclusion, but this fact is giving few people — citizens, investors, observers — any comfort. These are incredibly unhappy elections, taking place in the midst of a tragic three year economic reversal during which the country's stock market plunged 22%, according to Bloomberg. Inflation is high, corporate profit margins are thin, and massive Brazilian companies like steelmaker Vale and and quasi-state oil and gas company Petrobras are suffering from a wide range of ailments from mismanagement and corruption to weak demand from China. In other words, whoever wins this contest will have a hard road ahead. There are three candidates in Sunday's Presidential contest, but only truly two contenders. Aecio Neves, of the Social Democratic Party, is sure to lose but not by enough to allow another candidate to take a clear majority. That means incumbent Dilma Rousseff, of the Workers Party (PT), and Marina Silva of the Brazilian Socialist Party (PSB), will square off on October 26th. Silva was not meant to be a Presidential candidate. An environmentalist who grew up in extreme poverty, she was initially running along side candidate Eduardo Campos, who died in a tragic plane crash in August.For a while Campos' passing sparked interest in Silva. She started pulling ahead in election polls, and it seemed like investors who were betting that a fresh political face would mean an economic turn around for the country — like hedge fund billionaire Michael Novogratz of Fortress Investment Group — seemed to be getting what they wished for. But then it all stopped. In September Rousseff started inching ahead of Silva and now has a 7 point lead according to the most recent poll data.   As all this happened, Brazil's stock market the Bovespa, started to protest. It fell 14%. Yahoo Finance As Silva began to lose in the polls, Wall Street started to question the entire recovery narrative. Cantor Fitzgerald called it a "farce" in a recent note. In part, they reasoned, because change was not really change. "It does not take much sense of history to appreciate the irony that Ms. Silva is running a reform campaign against a leftist Workers Party candidate, who herself came in under a reform agenda president (Lula). Moreover, Ms. Silva was herself a Workers Party minister from 2003 to 2008 under Lula." What's more, others argued, Silva's platform may be too ambitious for a country suffering from a recession. On the one hand she wants to maintain the expensive adn expansive social programs that have pulled Brazilians out of poverty and kept unemployment low. On the other hand Silva also wants to implement reform, tightening monetary policy to stem inflation and simplifying the country's tax code. "Reforms were stymied when growth was buoyant," wrote analysts from London-based Spiro Sovereign Strategy in a recent note. "They will prove doubly difficult to implement when the economy is contracting, the US Federal Reserve is preparing to raise interest rates and China’s economy is slowing markedly."

REUTERS/Jeff KowalskyThe General Motors logo is seen outside its headquarters at the Renaissance Center in Detroit, Michigan.Citi analyst Itay Michaeli has a new note about General Motors. He's bullish, and he's direct: "Buy GM." "After a difficult YTD for GM investors, we previewed the Investor Day [held this week] as something of a defining moment for stock sentiment," he writes. "In our view, management delivered nearly perfectly on our 'wish list' in a message filled with conviction and clarity." There's definitely a shift in attitude toward GM's as an investment. The stock has been in the doldrums for what seems like forever. Maybe it's due to a perception that Ford is headed into a weak period, revamping its bestselling F-150 pickup to be lighter in weight and thereby by threatening, short term, a cash cow. Maybe it's because GM has handled its massive recall in a swift and satisfying enough manner for the markets — and because the company hasn't seen sales collapse as a result. It's hard to write "recall notwithstanding" because the GM recall has been so huge. But let's give it a shot: recall notwithstanding, GM has been decisively recovering from the 2009 bailout and bankruptcy for five years. But Wall Street hasn't thought much of the New GM. That could be about to change. FREE AppDownload

IMDB / Paramount PicturesNEW YORK (Reuters) - Bill Gross will release his first investment outlook with Janus Capital, the smaller rival for whom he left bond fund manager Pimco, next Thursday. Gross, now a portfolio manager, will release the outlook "Stayin' Alive" after a webcast for institutional investors with Janus Capital Group &lt;jns.n&gt; chief executive Dick Weil on global unconstrained bond strategy, according to an invitation to the event seen by Reuters on Friday. Sometimes called the bond king for his long track record in fixed income, Gross's departure last Friday from his post as chief investment officer at Pimco shocked markets, even affecting the prices of some U.S. Treasuries. Pimco has since seen money stream for the exit, with a record $23.5 billion of withdrawals from its flagship Pimco Total Return Fund in September. The largest daily outflow last month came on the day of Bill Gross's surprise resignation.   (Reporting by Luciana Lopez; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama) FREE AppDownload
Nir Elias/Reuters The latest pressure to raise employee wages arrives at an inopportune time for McDonald's and its legion of franchisees. Fast-casual chains like Chipotle Mexican Grill are increasingly threatening the company's business, and all is not well within the kingdom of the Golden Arches. Relations are tense between the corporate base and its independently owned restaurants, with franchisees dissatisfied by low margins on an increasingly complex menu, an abundance of promotional expenditures, and renovation costs. A corporate-dictated increase of wages at McDonald's restaurants would almost certainly put additional burdens on franchisees. The company could offer owner-operators a financial cushion during a transitional period, but this strategy might prove damaging to McDonald's financials and its stock. These complications, and others, give McDonald's and its franchisees plenty of incentive to take a wait-and-see approach on the wage issue, but the company might also have strong reasons to get out in front of the mounting controversy and raise employee pay ahead of anything federal or state governments might do. The federal minimum wage was last raised in 2009 -- putting it at $7.25 per hour -- and in the State of the Union address in January, President Obama called on Congress to raise the national minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. Twenty-three states and the District of Columbia have minimum wages higher than the federal minimum. Let's look at what McDonald's might gain by getting out in front of a federal mandate and raising wages for its employees. Proactive wage raises would be good for McDonald's imageIt's no secret that McDonald's has an image problem. The company faces an increasingly health-conscious public, and controversies surrounding its employment practices often generate more press than additions to its menu or modifications on its advertising and branding fronts. The wage issue is bound to receive increasing political attention, and it's heating up quickly at the state level, with 34 states in the last year considering bills that would raise the minimum wage within their borders. McDonald's' employment structure and brand visibility guarantee it will remain at the center of this heated debate, and ongoing protests targeting the company have the potential to do lasting damage to its image. Chipotle has scored major victories against McDonald's on the battlefield of public opinion by presenting a socially and environmentally conscious image that gels with current cultural trends and sentiments. The fast-casual chain and its peers are succeeding, in part, because they recognize that the choice between restaurants is largely determined by how a given experience makes the consumer feel, physically and psychologically. Becoming a proactive force in the push to raise the nation's wages would allow McDonald's to add an important, albeit partially symbolic, asset to its vast real estate holdings: the moral high ground. Getty Better employees could improve customer satisfactionRecent declines in same-store sales would seem to give franchisees an obvious and well-founded reason to bristle at the prospect of headquarters dictating a wage increase. McDonald's said August sales at its global locations dipped 3.7%, with sales at U.S. stores down 2.8%. This isn't the type of announcement that would typically be followed by an increase in low-level employee wages, but the question of why sales are falling is central when examining whether such a move would be valuable. Last year saw a McDonald's executive acknowledge "broken" customer service, with rude employees being cited as a major reason for customer dissatisfaction. A recent report from the American Consumer Satisfaction Index ranking the company dead last in customer satisfaction suggests the company has a ways to go. Offering higher wages should allow the company to attract and retain better employees. Making this move ahead of government schedules would not only enable the fast-food chain to strengthen its workforce relative to competitors, it would fundamentally change what it means to work at a McDonald's. Wikimedia CommonsThe U.S. minimum wage over the years. Raising wages at its own pace could allow McDonald's to better manage price increases There's been no shortage of studies that aim to model what wage hikes at McDonald's would mean for its menu prices or bottom line. Many have made projections based on isolated increases to the company's labor costs, without accounting for possible cost increases earlier in the food production chain or inflation that might occur as a result of a new U.S. minimum wage. Accurately modeling the effects of a significant federal minimum wage increase on a store's pricing involves variables that can be fairly described as unknowable. However, without major advances in automation, increases in employee wages can reasonably be expected to correlate with increased menu pricing. Raising its prices ahead of state and national curves could afford McDonald's better positioning as it sets its own pace. The company's offerings are decidedly price-sensitive, and smaller, staggered increases to menu costs would look better to consumers than big jumps. Foolish thoughtsWith American wealth inequality at record levels, and the wage debate receiving increasing media focus, it's reasonable to expect a significant increase to the national minimum wage within the next several years. If such an increase can be taken as likely within the next five years, McDonald's corporate management should weigh whether the short-term expenses and difficulties created by raising employee wages prior to government mandates outweigh the potential benefits of such a move. Facing identity issues that threaten its long-term future, McDonald's has surprisingly strong incentives to raise its wages ahead of government action.

Thomson ReutersJPMorgan Chase trader Frederick Reimer works in the company's stall on the floor of the New York Stock ExchangeBy Karen Freifeld NEW YORK (Reuters) - Connecticut Attorney General George Jepsen is investigating the massive data breach at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co , according to a person familiar with the matter. The office has been in contact with JPMorgan Chase about the incident since it first surfaced in August, the person said. On Thursday, JPMorgan revealed the scope of the breach, saying names, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses of the holders of some 83 million households and small business accounts were exposed when its computer systems were compromised by hackers. Other state attorneys general are "very concerned and sharing information" about the incident amongst themselves, another source said, although a multi-state group to probe the matter has not yet formed.

Bloomberg News, YoutubeBrad Hintz.Veteran Wall Street analyst Brad Hintz circulated an insightful farewell memo on Friday announcing his last day at Sanford Bernstein after working there for 13 years. Hintz discusses the changes and current controversies surrounding the financial industry. And he's someone who definitely knows the ins-and-outs. Hintz had a long and diverse career on Wall Street. As a vice president at Sanford Bernstein, he was the "go-to analyst" for comment on the big banks. Before that, he spent three years as the CFO at Lehman Brothers. He got out before the financial crash and went on to spend 10 years at Morgan Stanley as a managing director and treasurer. Here is his memo: After thirteen years in equity research, I am retiring from Sanford Bernstein to teach at NYU's Stern School. As a result, today Bernstein is terminating coverage of the capital markets banks, investment banking boutiques, futures exchanges and e-brokers.  Looking back, capital markets has been a fascinating industry to cover. Wall Street is a kaleidoscope of booms and market collapses, bankruptcies and resurrections, blustering traders and cosmopolitan bankers, heroes and villains. The industry has evolved and shifted, the business models have changed and new players have come and gone. But it is never boring and always challenging. But it is the very uncertainty of the industry’s performance that makes the capital markets stocks so attractive when an economic cycle recovers and so painful during market disruptions. I have been blessed to have worked at a firm, whose core franchise remains independent research. At Bernstein an equity analyst is free to publish in depth and at times, controversial analyses. And the firm's research-sales team can clearly deliver an analyst's message to the markets. It is a remarkable platform for a researcher. Today, six years after the crisis, the securities business is in a period of transition.  The trading businesses of Wall Street are generating returns well below their cost of capital. Even in the middle of an M&amp;A rebound, still-buoyant debt capital markets and an equity underwriting boom, the aggregate ROEs of the banks are lackluster, exacerbated by ever tightening regulatory rules and unconventional monetary policy initiatives on both sides of the Atlantic.  The underlying expectation of investors, is that eventually, the Street's equity and fixed income market products and services will be repriced to reflect the costs of the new regulation and returns will rebound.  But this is far from certain.  Are the new rules coming from Washington, London or Basel, just the fine tuning of already established regulatory models or is there a conscious strategy to shift the capital markets business from the universal banks to smaller and presumably less systemically important participants?  With the rise investment banking boutiques, electronic trading venues, central clearing entities, inter-broker dealers trading in less liquid assets, hedge funds and new, lighter regulated  financial institutions, it appears that the invisible hand of economics is at work. This will play out over the next five years and remains the key investment controversy facing the capital markets sector. I would like to thank the Bernstein clients for their support and friendship over the last thirteen years. I have fond memories of my time at Bernstein, Lehman Brothers and Morgan Stanley.  Best wishes, Brad Hintz Next up, he will be teaching at NYU's Stern School. FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/ Sebastien NogierByron Wien.Byron Wien writes that he has "so much to worry about." In his new monthly market commentary to Blackstone clients, the veteran Wall Street strategist identifies everything that worries him in the world today. Concerns include high stock market valuations, dysfunctional US politics, and geopolitical turbulence in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and Asia. On the economic front, most people would agree low inflation and improving employment levels are good things. But Wien points out something that often gets overlooked amid all of the good news. He writes: The one economic area I am concerned about is housing. With the improvement in employment and continued low interest rates I would have expected the monthly figures on housing starts, new and existing home sales, and mortgage applications for purchase to be consistently strong, but the data have been mixed. I wonder if there are some secular changes taking place in terms of more flexible lifestyles, as well as delayed marriages and family formations. Housing is a key component of growth, so this is an area that bears close attention. Wien isn't the only one who has noticed this area of weakness. And with the prospect of higher interest rates, it appears that home prices will only become more expensive and less attractive to buyers. Economists note that a big hindrance to housing is tighter supply. Cheap foreclosure inventory has been vanishing. Meanwhile, homebuilders are struggling to find workers to build and land to build on. There's also the matter of people who no longer believe in homes as a good investment. After the housing market crash, many potential homebuyers think they'd be better off renting. And let's not forget the fact that the housing market has been recovering for about five years. Many people interested in buying homes have already bought their homes. There are plenty of factors holding back housing. At some point we'll probably have to think about housing as a drag.

U.S. Air ForceA member of the Air Force Special Operations Command’s, Special Tactics Training Squadron strains while lifting weights during a strength and conditioning session at Hurlburt Field, Florida.Stocks rallied on Friday after a jobs report that showed nonfarm payrolls grew more than expected in September while the unemployment rate fell below 6% for the first time since July 2008. First, the scoreboard: And now, the top stories on Friday: 1. The jobs report was a blowout. Nonfarm payrolls grew by 248,000 in September better than the 215,000 that was expected by Wall Street economists and better than the 142,000 gain last month. August's numbers were revised higher to 180,000. The unemployment rate also fell to 5.9%, the first time the unemployment rate has fallen below 6% since July 2008, and better than expectations for the unemployment rate to remain unchanged at 6.1%. Wage growth was the piece of the jobs report that disappointed, however, with wages flat month-over-month and up 2% year-over-year, below expectations for gains of 0.2% and 2.2%, respectively.  2. A much-watched piece of the jobs report, the labor force participation rate, also fell to its lowest level since 1978. The labor force participation rate fell to 62.7% from 62.8% in August, and the decline in the labor force has been one of the most hotly debated questions in economics. As Business Insider's Andy Kiersz wrote on Friday: "On the one hand, America is aging, and the baby boomers are beginning to retire. That leads to a natural demographic decline in the participation rate.... On the other hand, the US is coming out of the worst recession it has faced in decades, and the participation rate dropped much more sharply since 2008. The cyclical effects from the recession may also be a big factor in the declining participation rate." 3. Stocks rallied on Friday, with all of the major averages gaining more than 1%. The averages, however, still finished the week with losses in what was a choppy week of trade. There was a rash of economic data this week, and when it was all said and done, Drew Matus at UBS wrote in a note to clients that simply: "Sometimes good news is good news." Matus wrote that Q3 GDP now appears to be tracking about 0.5% above his initial 3.2% annualized growth expectation, with consumer spending appearing to have accelerated, fixed business investment improved, and the labor market appearing solid.  4. Commodities continued to take a beating this week, as crude oil fell below $90 a barrel for the first time this year and gold continued to fall. Gold fell below $1200 an ounce on Friday, and is now near its worst level of the year as the entire commodity space continues to be under pressure.  5. Wall Street veteran analyst Brad Hintz announced that he is leaving Sanford Bernstein, where he has been one of the top financial sector analysts for the last 13 years. Hintz was considered a "go-to" analysts for comment on the big banks, and is leaving Bernstein, which is also terminating coverage of capital markets banks and investment banking boutiques, to take a position at NYU's Stern School.  6. Stocks in the "Ebola trade" had a big day after a report from CNN said that a patient was admitted to a Washington, D.C.-area hospital with Ebola-like symptoms. Some of the big gainers from this trade include Tekmira and BioCryst, which are developing Ebola treatments, and Sarepta Pharmaceuticals, which develops treatments for rare diseases.  7. Also on the economic data front, America's oil deficit fell to its lowest level in 10 years as the US balance of trade unexpectedly narrowed in August, to $40.1 billion from $40.4 billion in July. Following the report, Ian Shepherdson at Pantheon Macro said the report was "flattered by oil exports," but added that the trade deficit will make a "hefty" contribution to Q3 GDP, which he expects to come in at 3.5%.  8. A late afternoon report in The Wall Street Journal said that Yahoo wants to invest in Snapchat as part of a fundraising round that values the vanishing picture app at $10 billion.  Don't Miss: Here's How To Do Warren Buffett's Favorite Critical Thinking Exercise » FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Stephen Lam Tesla announced recently that it was planning to build an electric car for the mass consumer. The Model 3 will arrive in 2017, following the much-anticipated Model X crossover, which is due to hit the streets next year. The $35,000 Model 3 will be the cheapest vehicle yet to emerge from Tesla's Fremont, California, factory. But its success won't be automatic. Here are three things the Model 3 must deliver to succeed.  Battery Range, Battery Range, Battery Range Every conversation about electric cars seems to begin and end with battery range. The Model 3 is no exception.   "The current electric car market is flush with $35,000 cars, and they all have identical range specs of 60-90 miles," says Karl Brauer, senior market analyst for Kelley Blue Book (KBB). "If the Tesla Model 3 can't significantly increase that range, it will sell about as well as the others — which isn't very well." The current market leader for electric cars is Tesla's own Model S. But at the Model 3's expected price point, the Nissan Leaf that reigns supreme. However, with just over 22,000 units sold in 2013 and only 12,000 units sold so far this year, the Leaf isn't going to make the internal-combustion engine vanish any time soon.  NissanNissan Leaf.Tesla doesn't want to sell 20,000 or 30,000 Model 3s each year — it wants to sell hundreds of thousands of them. To meet those lofty expectations, it must overcome the consumer's range anxiety and liberate the electric car from its never-ending search for a charging stations, executive market analyst for KBB Jack R. Nerad told Business Insider. "If you can't get it to drive for an overnight trip without recharging, it's just not going to work for a lot of people."  Exactly how much range a mass-market electric should have is debated. Something in the ballpark of 60 to 90 miles is obviously not enough. Tesla's Model S P85, with 265 miles of range, deals with the anxiety issue but is expensive at nearly $80,000. However, a middle ground of 180 to 200 miles may allow the Model 3 to have the "versatility and usability" that Nerad believes the car needs to capture the minds — and wallets — of consumers. Reduced Charge Times Model 3's potential buyers differ significantly from those customers currently lining up to reserve the Model S. Model S buyers are tech-savvy early adopters; potential Model 3 buyers aren't. Early adopters will tolerate the quirks of their new toys, including extended recharging times. People who are used to a quick stop at the pump in order to drive another 300 miles are not likely to be as patient. "A minimum of 30 minutes to charge your car is too long," Nerad said. "Most people are barely willing to spend five minutes at the gas station."  Youtube/Mark WooldridgeTesla Model S battery swap.One solution is Tesla's battery swap program that, for $60 to $80, can swap out a car's drained batter for a fully charged one in 90 seconds. However, the program is still in its infancy, and it's unclear whether Tesla can implement it on a large enough scale. Before Tesla, fellow tech startup Better Place offered its own battery-swap service that failed to gain traction, ending with the company's liquidation in 2013. Must Remain Affordable In addition to a pleasant user experience, Tesla must deliver the Model 3 on time and at the announced $35,000 price point. One of the Model 3's assumed competitive advantages is the perception that you'll be getting a Tesla for the price of a Leaf. If the cost of the Model 3 creeps up, it starts to look like a downsized Model S.  The main challenge for an affordable Model 3 is the potential cost of its battery packs. However, that's where the company's new gigafactories would come into play, John Voelcker, senior editor for Green Car Reports, told CNET. According to Voelcker, without the new gigafactories, not only would Tesla struggle to hit the $35,000 price point, it would not even be able to come close to making enough batteries for the Model 3 to hit production targets.   FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski The markets are in rally mode after the better-than-expected jobs report on Friday. But stocks that are part of the "Ebola trade" are having an even bigger day. Near noon, shares of Tekmira Pharmaceuticals, BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, and Sarepta Therapeutics were all higher by at least 8%. Tekmira and BioCryst are currently working on Ebola treatments, while investors see Sarepta as a potential play on Ebola given that it develops treatments for rare diseases. Also higher on Friday were shares of Lakeland Industries, which makes hazmat suits and has gained 16% this week. These stocks have been climbing since the first case of Ebola in the US was confirmed on Tuesday afternoon. Most recently, a report from CNN on Friday said that a patient was admitted to a Washington, D.C.-area hospital with Ebola-like symptoms. FREE AppDownload

Wikimedia CommonsMost investors dislike rising rates. They make equities less attractive, and they cause instant markdowns to fixed income holdings. But pension fund managers welcome them with open arms. Why? Because companies are required to calculate the present value of their future pension obligations using prevailing rates. When rates rise, their current obligations fall. Last year, managers got a double-barreled boost from both rising interest rates and a soaring stock market – a welcome change from the persistently low interest rates that have caused pension shortfalls to march steadily higher since 2008. But this year, interest rates have fallen despite nearly universal predictions to the contrary, and even weaker asset returns haven’t allowed funds to close the funding gap. The result: come December, pension plans will provide a positive contribution to the balance sheet or earnings as they did in 2013. Indeed, Credit Suisse says pensions are more likely to be an outright drag than otherwise, but also notes that the impact on earnings could be delayed because of the complexity of pension accounting. Firms use prevailing investment-grade bond yields to estimate the present value of their future obligations. When rates rise, corporate obligations look smaller, and required contributions shrink. That’s what happened in 2013, say Credit Suisse analysts Ron Graziano and Amit Varshney, when the pension plans of the S&amp;P 500 got a $200 billion boost from the 75-basis-point increase in rates. Adding to the good news, pension plan assets grew 5.8 percent that year. By year-end, plans looked to be 88 percent funded, up from 77 percent at the start of the year. This also resulted in a significant earnings boost. Verizon booked a $3.7 billion pension-related after-tax gain in the fourth quarter, while Ashland, a Kentucky-based chemicals company, booked $313 million. Required contributions fell too: Cigna’s 2014 estimated contribution of $100 million is nearly 50 percent below that of 2013 because the plan’s funded status improved by $1 billion. Times have changed. As of July 31, the discount rate had fallen 50 basis points in 2014, resulting in an estimated shortfall increases of some $115 billion. Varshney and Graziano say plan assets would have to increase 6.8 percent by year-end to make up for the drop in the discount rate — an unlikely outcome considering that they were down 0.5 percent as of July 31. This combined effect caused a decline in funded status to an estimated 82 percent. “Pensions were a major benefit last year, especially for aerospace companies and auto companies,” Graziano says. “This year, they won’t provide that same positive kick.” Of the companies with the 10 largest pension plans, UPS’s estimated funded status was hardest hit through July, from 89 percent to 79 percent, a decline of $3.9 billion. GM’s estimated $6.8 billion decline was the largest on a dollar basis, and its funded status dropped from 80 percent to 74 percent. If a challenging rate environment wasn’t making life difficult enough, there’s also a potential long-term spoiler lurking on the horizon. The Society of Actuaries recently released a draft paper suggesting that companies start incorporating Americans’ ever-lengthening life spans when calculating their pension obligations. It’s been two decades since the last change of actuarial assumptions, and during that time life expectancy for 65-year-olds has increased 10 percent for men (from 19.6 years to 21.6 years) and 11 percent for women (from 21.4 years to 23.8 years). While the guideline isn’t yet mandatory, some companies have already begun to use it, and with dramatic results. AT&amp;T’s pension obligations grew by some $2 billion while Lockheed Martin’s rose $3.4 billion. If all companies adopted the new mortality tables in 2014, the estimated corporate funding gap would widen, with plans’ funded status dropping from 82 percent to between 75 and 78 percent, Graziano and Varshney say. However, there’s still uncertainty about the near term impact. Most companies won’t adopt the new method until they have to, but it offers a glimpse of what lies ahead. FREE AppDownload
That quote is from Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi in an interview with the FT, and it's probably the perfect way to describe the situation that Europe has before it. (Via Vincenzo Scarpetta). Currently Europe faces a dismal economy almost everywhere. There's sky-high unemployment, a risk of deflation, and other ills. But Europe won't take the measures needed to address the problem — like spending more money to hire workers — in part because the countries have agreed to a deficit pact in which the countries have all vowed not to borrow more than 3% GDP each year. And so now you have this long-term existential threat to Europe building in the form of anti-Eurozone and anti-EU candidates in France (the National Front), Germany (AfD), and the UK (UKIP). These parties thrive in the horrible environment in which people see a bleak future and no help (or even concern) from the elites in Brussels. Renzi is right that a 4.4% deficit in France would be far better than the nationalist lLe Pen winning in the next election. The question is if Europe lets that happen. FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Fred ProuserBill Gross' departure from PIMCO last Friday was so shocking that people are still talking about it. And since he left the firm abruptly in January, Mohamed El-Erian, PIMCO's former CEO and co-CIO, had to chime in. El-Erian appeared on-air with Bloomberg TV's Betty Liu on Friday to discuss the US economy and Gross' departure. He told Liu that he wasn't expecting this from Gross. "I was very surprised," said El-Erian. "Both the fact that it happened and how it happened was a surprise." But he wasn't surprised by the new Dan Ivascyn-led PIMCO team. "I've worked with these people. I know them really well. They are superb and Dan Ivascyn is superb as a leader," he added. Bill Gross joined Janus Capital following his PIMCO departure. He took over the firm's global macro bond trading from Newport Beach, California last Monday. CNBC's David Faber reported that Gross quit to preempt his own firing. It is reported that he was exhibiting erratic behavior for months prior to his resignation. Following his departure, investors had pulled out around $10 billion from PIMCO. FREE AppDownload
Vladimir Putin's tit-for-tat sanctions against food imports from the West have driven consumer price inflation in Russia to 8% in September — its highest point in three years and way above the Russian central bank's target of 5% to 6%. Trading Economics The figures will be a headache for policymakers faced with a sluggish economy on the one hand, struggling under Western sanctions imposed because of Russia's role in the ongoing crisis in Ukraine, and swiftly rising prices on the other. REUTERS/Alexander Zemlianichenko/Pool  Last month, Putin backed price freezes for natural gas, power, and rail in 2014 in an effort to restrain inflation, but so far his government has refused to ease up on the self-imposed sanctions that are widely blamed for pushing up prices. Those sanctions have barred various food imports from the West. Predictably, this has led to shortages of certain types of food: brie and parmesan being two, according to USA Today. Prices of some staples have risen 36%. It is not the case that Russia is facing the kind of food shortages it saw in the Soviet era — with breadlines — or in the 1990s, after it defaulted on its national debt. But it is the case that certain Western food products are becoming unavailable and domestic products are rising in price. On Friday, Russia's Agriculture Ministry said it was not ready to consider the "possibility of liberalizing the list" of banned products that include meat, fish, dairy, fruit, and vegetables from the United States, the EU, Australia, Canada, and Norway. Agriculture Minister Nikolai Fyodorov told the Russian news agency TASS: We are waiting for them to come to their senses and reassess their perception of Russia in a civilized way. FREE AppDownload

MasterMindsMichael de GuzmanIn 1993, a prospector named Michael de Guzman walked out of the jungles of Borneo with extraordinary news: he found gold. This is according to MasterMinds, a Canadian true crime documentary television series produced by truTV. For the next three years, de Guzman produced thousands of core samples riddled with gold.  Canada's CBC News has a detailed timeline of the events. During that period, the market value of de Guzman's employer, Bre-X Minerals, went from nothing to $6 billion.  BusinessWeek notes that Wall Street's top analysts were extremely bullish on the stock.  Big funds poured money into the stock and the world's major miners wrestled for a piece of the action. The problem: there was no gold. As the story unraveled, records mysteriously burned and people unexpectedly died.  Questions were left unanswered. There are plenty of people who wish this story would just go away.  But just a few days ago, a lawyer representing one of the players in the Bre-X story was disbarred. What follows is a summary of MasterMinds' telling of the incredible story. NOTE: The images and the details in this feature are from MasterMinds.

  Wynn Las VegasOwners of the heavily polluted waterfront property that Wynn Resorts plans to develop into a $1.6 billion resort casino attempted to conceal the fact that a convicted felon and known mob associate was profiting from the land deal, according to federal and state grand jury indictments unsealed Thursday. The indictments allege that Charles Lightbody, Dustin DeNunzio, and Anthony Gattineri created fraudulent documents in an effort to mislead state investigators and Wynn, which won the lucrative Boston-area resort casino license in September with a plan to build a gleaming new luxury resort casino complex in Everett, a Boston suburb. The three men have been arrested and charged with federal conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, and aiding and abetting. They also face state-level charges that they impeded a Massachusetts Gaming Commission investigation and tampered with evidence. In federal court Thursday, Lightbody, 54, of Revere, did not enter a plea and will remain in custody until his next court date Tuesday. Lightbody's attorney Robert Goldstein said his client maintained his innocence and should not be detained because he did not present a flight risk. "He knew that this day would be coming," Goldstein said after the arraignment. "What we all need to remember is that what he's being charged with is a real estate investment (from) some years ago. That's what this case is all about ... He purchased this land well before there was any interest in casinos." DeNunzio, 37, of Cambridge, and Anthony Gattineri, 56, of Winchester, both pleaded not guilty to the charges and were released Thursday. The men are partners in FBT Everett Realty LLC, which owns the roughly 30-acre former Monsanto chemical plant property. Wynn Resorts signed an option agreement on the land in December 2012 and has been paying FBT Everett Realty $100,000 a month for the right to eventually purchase the property if it won the casino license. But questions about Lightbody's stake in the land, which Wynn had ultimately expected to buy for $35 million, loomed over the license deliberations. State law prohibits criminals from profiting from gambling facilities. Prosecutors allege Lightbody, DeNunzio, and Gattineri, in an attempt to assuage concerns, created fraudulent documents claiming that Lightbody had transferred his ownership stake to Gattineri for a $1.7 million promissory note. The state indictment includes similar allegations and also charges Lightbody with assaulting a man during a casino election rally in Revere in October 2013. The three will be arraigned on the state charges at a later date. They face up to 20 years in prison on the federal wire fraud charges and five years on the state charges if convicted. Wynn declined to comment Thursday on the ownership status of the land, only issuing a short statement applauding the "rigor and diligence" demonstrated by state officials. A state Gaming Commission spokeswoman said the indictment was not expected to change the panel's decision to award Wynn the casino license, adding that the charges send a "loud message" that the agency is committed to preserving the "integrity of the gaming industry." Opponents of the Wynn project, though, reacted swiftly. Mohegan Sun, which lost to Wynn in the gambling license competition, said the indictments have "darkened a cloud" that's long lingered over the Everett land. Boston Mayor Martin Walsh directed his criticism at gambling regulators: "The Massachusetts Gaming Commission and their investigatory body clearly failed the people of Boston and of the Commonwealth by allowing — even remotely — the taint of corruption to be associated with this land transaction." And anti-casino activists, who are supporting November's ballot question to repeal the state's casino law and halt any gambling projects, said the indictments are another black eye for state lawmakers.

Gold's been pretty ugly lately. The improving US economy and the belief that the Fed will raise rates fairly soon has shattered the gold-bug narrative about hyperinflation, doom, and dollar debasement. But gold in itself is not the worst gold-related investment you could make. Gold miners tend to act like leveraged bets on gold, as their fortunes can swing wildly based on future prospects of the yellow metal.  Junior gold miners are even more leveraged and volatile. These are smaller companies, with much more speculative access to resources. You don't even know really how much they'll be able to mine in the future. And you can go even more leveraged than that, by buying an ETF that moves 3x the direction of the junior gold miners! We didn't even know this existed until Pierce Crosby of Stocktwits pointed it out on Twitter. The ETF is called JNUG or Junior Nuggets (Nuggets itself is the 3x-leveraged regular gold miner ETF). Anyway, if you want to see a trade that's been nothing but a gigantic money sink all year, check out this one. JNUG is down 12% today, and down over 75% from its highs of the year. When something is going down, and you add 3 layers of leverage (miners ---&gt; juniors ---&gt; triple price movements) that's a mega money loser. Yahoo Finance FREE AppDownload

flickr / convergenciaiunioArtur Mas MADRID (Reuters) - The leader of Catalonia has set up a panel to supervise a contested independence referendum next month, defying Spain's central government which has gone to the courts to block the vote. The president of the wealthy north-east region, Artur Mas, appointed a seven-strong committee to oversee the ballot on Thursday evening, the local government said in a statement. It was the first official move to prepare for the planned Nov. 9 vote on separation from Spain since the Constitutional Court agreed on Monday to review the legality of the referendum -- a decision that effectively suspended the ballot. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's People's Party will appeal the creation of the commission, the head of its Catalan division said. "Mas has lost his sense of responsibility, his sense of state and his common sense," said Alicia Sanchez-Camacho. Catalonia, with a population of 7.5 million people, its own language and accounting for a fifth of Spain's economy, has long sought independence and was buoyed by the close result of last month's referendum in Scotland. Madrid, worried that a vote would tear the country apart just as it is slowly emerging from a ferocious economic downturn, argues that any ballot on secession would be against Spain's 1979 constitution. Catalonia said earlier this week it would temporarily suspend campaigning as it prepared to appeal against the Constitutional Court decision. Mas is due to meet pro-independence parties in Barcelona on Friday to decide strategy following the court ruling. Political analysts have said Mas was likely to call early regional elections, turning it into a de-facto plebiscite on secession. REUTERS/Albert GeaCatalonia flags. The Catalan capital of Barcelona is home to some of Spain's biggest companies, which are warily watching developments. "Obviously (the situation) is worrying ... What is desirable is for there to be a dialogue," said Josep Lluis Bonet, chairman of Catalan sparkling wine maker Freixenet. While most executives have held their views on independence close to their chests, fearful of a customer backlash, Bonet has been one of the most outspoken against separatism. "Things are just fine how they are and we hope we're lucky enough for it to stay that way," he told reporters before an Ibero-American conference in Madrid. Oil company Repsol's chairman Antonio Brufau, who is Catalan, also called for some soul-searching. "We need to start reflecting, so what is done is for the good of everyone. There are more things that unite us than keep us apart. We should look for the things that bring us together," Brufau told reporters. While Repsol is based in Madrid, its largest shareholder is Barcelona-based Caixabank, Spain's third biggest lender. Other major Spanish companies with headquarters in Barcelona include the country's largest drug company Grifols, global infrastructure firm Abertis, gas and power firm Gas Natural Fenosa and lender Sabadell.

REUTERS/Jim YoungParty like its 1999 in America.This was a solid report with 248,000 jobs added and combined upward revisions to July and August of 69,000. As always we shouldn't read too much into one month of data, but at the current pace (through September), the economy will add 2.72 million jobs this year (2.64 million private sector jobs). Right now 2014 is on pace to be the best year for both total and private sector job growth since 1999.A few other positives:  the unemployment rate declined to 5.9% (the lowest level since July 2008), U-6 (an alternative measure for labor underutilization) was at the lowest level since 2008, the number of part time workers for economic reasons declined slightly (lowest since October 2008), and the number of long term unemployed declined to the lowest level since January 2009.Unfortunately wage growth is still subdued. From the BLS: "Average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls, at $24.53, changed little in September (-1 cent). Over the year, average hourly earnings have risen by 2.0 percent. In September, average hourly earnings of private-sector production and nonsupervisory employees were unchanged at $20.67."With the unemployment rate at 5.9%, there is still little upward pressure on wages. Wages should pick up as the unemployment rate falls over the next couple of years, but with the currently low inflation and little wage pressure, the Fed will likely remain patient.A few more numbers:Total employment increased 248,000 from August to September and is now 1.07 million above the previous peak. Total employment is up 9.78 million from the employment recession low.Private payroll employment increased 236,000 from August to September, and private employment is now 1,547,000 above the previous peak (the unprecedented large number of government layoffs has held back total employment). Private employment is up 10.34 million from the low.Through the first nine months of 2014, the economy has added 2,040,000 payroll jobs - up from 1,736,000 added during the same period in 2013. My expectation at the beginning of the year was the economy would add between 2.4 and 2.7 million payroll jobs this year. That still looks about right.Employment-Population Ratio, 25 to 54 years oldSince the overall participation rate declined recently due to cyclical (recession) and demographic (aging population, younger people staying in school) reasons, an important graph is the employment-population ratio for the key working age group: 25 to 54 years old. In the earlier period the participation rate for this group was trending up as women joined the labor force. Since the early '90s, the participation rate moved more sideways, with a downward drift starting around '00 - and with ups and downs related to the business cycle.The 25 to 54 participation rate decreased in September to 80.7% from 81.1% in August, and the 25 to 54 employment population ratio decreased to 76.7% from 76.8%. As the recovery continues, I expect the participation rate for this group to increase a little — although the participation rate has been trending down for this group since the late '90s. Year-over-year Change in EmploymentThis graph shows the year-over-year change in total non-farm employment since 1968. In September, the year-over-year change was 2.635 million jobs, and it appears the pace of hiring is increasing.Right now it looks like 2014 will be the best year since 1999 for both total nonfarm and private sector employment growth.Part Time for Economic Reasons From the BLS report: The number of persons working part time for economic reasons decreased in September to 7.103 million from 7.277 million in August. This suggests significantly slack still in the labor market. These workers are included in the alternate measure of labor underutilization (U-6) that decreased to 11.8% in September from 12.0% in August.This is the lowest level for U-6 since October 2008.Unemployed over 26 WeeksThis graph shows the number of workers unemployed for 27 weeks or more.  According to the BLS, there are 2.954 million workers who have been unemployed for more than 26 weeks and still want a job. This was down from 2.963 in August. This is trending down, but is still very high.This is the lowest level for long term unemployed since January 2009.State and Local GovernmentThis graph shows total state and government payroll employment since January 2007. State and local governments lost jobs for four straight years. (Note: Scale doesn't start at zero to better show the change.)  In September 2014, state and local governments added 14,000 jobs.  State and local government employment is now up 143,000 from the bottom, but still 601,000 below the peak.Clearly state and local employment is now increasing.  And Federal government layoffs have slowed (payroll decreased by 2 thousand in September), but Federal employment is still down 25,000 for the year.

Flickr/Emilio LabradorThe ISM services index fell to 58.6 in September from 59.6 in August. This was slightly better than the 58.5 expected by economists. Also, any reading above 50 signals growth, which means the US services sector is growing at a healthy clip. From the report: "The New Orders Index registered 61 percent, 2.8 percentage points lower than the reading of 63.8 percent registered in August. The Employment Index increased 1.4 percentage points to 58.5 percent from the August reading of 57.1 percent and indicates growth for the seventh consecutive month. The Prices Index decreased 2.5 percentage points from the August reading of 57.7 percent to 55.2 percent, indicating prices increased at a slower rate in September when compared to August." All 12 industries submitting responses to this survey reported growth. Here are some quotes from the report: Earlier, we learned the September Markit services PMI was revised up to 58.9 from a preliminary (Flash) estimated of 58.5. This was down from 59.5 in August. But the report was still stronger than expected and it reflects a strong pace of growth. "A slowing in the pace of service sector growth in September matched a similar easing in the pace of manufacturing output growth seen during the month, suggesting the overall pace of economic expansion dipped to the weakest since May.," Markit's Chris Williamson said. "But the surveys nevertheless still point to the economy growing at an annualised rate of at least 3% in the third quarter." FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Tim ChongThe US trade deficit unexpectedly narrowed in August as the oil deficit fell to a ten-year low. In August, the trade deficit was $40.1 billion, down from $40.3 billion in July, and below expectations for $40.8 billion. Exports rose to a record $198.5 billion, according to the latest Balance of Trade report from the Census Bureau. Bloomberg's Victoria Stilwell noted that the trade deficit fell to its lowest level in seven months, while exports rose to a new record.  Petroleum exports in August rose to $6.05 billion from $5.9 billion in July, while year-to-date petroleum exports are up to $4.8 billion over last year. Stilwell noted that the petroleum deficit shrank to $13.1 billion in August, the smallest since July 2004.  In a note following the report, Ian Shepherdson at Pantheon Macro said, "In one line: Flattered by oil exports but trade will make a hefty contribution to Q3 GDP growth." Shepherdson added that overall, net trade will add to GDP growth in Q3 and still sees Q3 GDP coming in at 3.5%.  The trade report on Friday was somewhat overshadowed by the latest jobs report, which showed that nonfarm payrolls grew by 248,000 in September as the unemployment ate fell below 6% for the first time in more than six years.  Overall though, a strong morning for the US economy as US trade looks strong and the labor market continues to recover.

Today's jobs report, while overall very strong, showed a slight tick down in the labor force participation rate, from 62.8% last month to 62.7% this month. It's now at the lowest rate since 1978. Why the participation rate has fallen so much is one of the most hotly debated questions in economics. On the one hand, America is aging, and the baby boomers are beginning to retire. That leads to a natural demographic decline in the participation rate. On the other hand, the US is coming out of the worst recession it has faced in decades, and the participation rate dropped much more sharply since 2008. The cyclical effects from the recession may also be a big factor in the declining participation rate. Bureau of Labro Statistics, Business Insider FREE AppDownload

Remember gold? For a long time, it was THE story in financial markets. Traders and pundits told a wonderful story about how the economy was going into the toilet and that gold would explode to 10,000 because the Fed was creating dollars like crazy in a futile attempt to stimulate the market. But the story is over. The dream is dead. Gold looks like death. Following Friday's strong jobs report, in which the unemployment rate fell to 5.9%, gold has broken below $1200.

REUTERS/PlatiauWe just got the perfect jobs report for the economy. The payrolls jumped and the unemployment rate dropped, which is a great sign for the economy. And yet, average hourly earnings saw no growth month-over-month, or just 2.0% growth year-over-year. "The small cloud on the giant silver lining would be the flat average hourly earnings figure, which may be the result of the rebound in retail workers (post-strike) or be a reflection of the demographic impact of more highly paid baby boomers retiring," UBS' Drew Matus said. These lower-than-expected earnings numbers confirm that inflation remains at very low levels. It also gives the Federal Reserve the flexibility to keep monetary policy loose for as long as it needs. Dow futures were up 92 points, S&amp;P futures were up 12 points, and Nasdaq futures were up 23 points. Futures were up ahead of the report, but they're holding their gains. Meanwhile, the dollar is rallying. US companies added 248,000 nonfarm payrolls in September, which was much stronger than the 215,000 expected.

REUTERS/Stefano RennaProtestors against the European Central Bank in Naples on 2 October 2014. People who are concerned that the eurozone is repeating Japan’s lost decade of low growth and deflation in the 1990s are wrong — things are actually much worse. Japan's lost decade should actually be a "target to reach" for Europe, according to a research note on Friday by Ruben Segura-Cayuela at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “Concerns regarding the Japanification of the euro area are increasing," Segura-Cayuela writes. "We argue that we should not fear such a scenario.” That sounds like good news at first, but what Segura-Cayuela actually means is that we should worrying about a much scarier scenario.  As things stand, the eurozone is in a much worse position than Japan, the note explains: Back in 1995, the unemployment rate in Japan was not too far from 3%. Additionally, Japan has managed to enjoy a decent GDP per capita growth compared with the euro area. The current situation in the euro area is far from the initial conditions observed in Japan back then. The unemployment rate is four times higher and it is hard to see, without ambitious reforms, sustained productivity growth that would avoid a continued deterioration of living standards. Japanese unemployment did not even reach 6% in the worst periods of the last two decades. There job market was not only much stronger, but the country did not have th weak and fragmented political and economic institutions that the eurozone has today.  “With large levels of unemployment and deteriorating living conditions, political and social instability is likely to arise in the medium term… we think it is certainly unavoidable on the current path,” the note added.   The note adds that there are some similarities between Japan and the eurozone, particularly in terms of an ageing population, which will weaken investment, growth and productivity. But really, Europe would kill for Japan’s lost decades.  FREE AppDownload

Thomson ReutersUndated handout photo of Canadian transport executive Cy Tokmakjian holding hands with his wife Helen. Dinners at fancy restaurants, week-long family vacations and a flat-screen TV: the bribes that Cuba accused Canadian businessman Cy Tokmakjian of giving Cuban officials were modest by corruption standards in many developing nations. But they have cost him dearly. Tokmakjian, 74, was sentenced last week to 15 years in prison and $100 million of his company's assets were seized. A Cuban court ruled that the gifts were used to help direct lucrative contracts to Tokmakjian's transportation company, which over 20 years became one of the most successful foreign companies on the communist-led island. The 168-page sentencing document, reviewed by Reuters, portrays a pervasive pattern of Tokmakjian wooing public officials and executives of his joint venture partners. The document, signed by five judges of the Cuban court, was based on their findings from a two-week trial in June and provided the basis for punishment. Tokmakjian, who was arrested three years ago, has denied wrongdoing and, according to his son, refused to consider any deal that might free him in return for admitting guilt. His company, the privately held Concord, Ontario-based Tokmakjian Group, says prosecutors failed to prove any of the charges in what it called a "show trial" and that the company founder was not allowed to mount a robust defense. The Tokmakjian Group declined Reuters requests to address most of the specific allegations in the court document. But it said it went to trial equipped with witnesses to refute the allegations, audited financial records, Cuban legal experts, and Canadian officials. Then, the company said, it was thwarted by the court. "Cy never got to defend himself," said Lee Hacker, vice-president of finance and company spokesman. "Almost all of the witnesses we wanted to call were denied appearance by the Cuban court. We did not have a trial by any standard. Cy was not afforded the opportunity to refute what they have accused him of." The investigation into his company's dealings in Cuba also landed 16 other people in prison, including two Canadian employees, five Cuban employees, and nine other Cubans who were government officials or employees of state enterprises, some of them in joint ventures with the Tokmakjian Group. They received prison terms ranging from 6 to 20 years.

The case has offered a peek into the Cuban government's view of corruption. It has also strained Cuba's relations with Canada, a major trading partner, and could deter foreigners from investing in the Caribbean island. Peter Kent, a member of Canada's parliament from the Toronto area, called the verdict "outrageous" and a "very strong reminder that international investors should beware" of Cuba. A number of questions remain unresolved about the case. Chief among them is whether Tokmakjian was guilty as charged or whether Cuba had another agenda in pursuing a case against a businessman previously favored by top Cuban officials. Tokmakjian's company says it believes Cuba wanted to destroy the business and take its assets. Tokmakjian was once hailed as a model business partner who supplied crucial transportation equipment during a severe economic crisis after the collapse of the Soviet Union. He even received a business award from Fidel Castro.    President Raul Castro launched a crackdown on graft after he succeeded his older brother Fidel in 2008. Dozens of Cubans working at government agencies and state companies, as well as several foreigners, have faced charges of corruption or other economic crimes. Western diplomats and foreign business people say it has been standard practice to offer small cash bribes to get Cuban officials to open a file or move paperwork through the system. The court said individual gifts were just part of a wide-ranging scheme in which Tokmakjian persuaded officials to bend or break the law in his favor. With business flowing his way, he then took measures to cover up his illicit dealings and evade taxes, the court said. Tokmakjian was found guilty of bribery, damaging the Cuban economy, illicit economic activity, currency trafficking, fraud and tax evasion. Cuba put a number on the damage to its economy: $91 million. The Tokmakjian Group supplied vehicles, motors, parts and construction equipment to Cuba's government and had joint ventures with state companies under the direction of the sugar, industry and tourism ministries. The company did an estimated $80 million in annual business in Cuba, one of at least 11 countries in the Americas, Europe and Asia where it has operated. Tokmakjian directed subordinates to pay bribes, the court said, using gasoline and travel expense reports to account for the money. He also allegedly made payments to foreign credit cards held by his Cuban beneficiaries in an attempt to avoid detection.        One Cuban trade official declined to comment on the trial but said investors should not get the wrong message. Cuba, he said, is still open for business. "What we have is a clear message that in Cuba there is zero tolerance for corruption and illegality," Pedro Luis Padron, the director of U.S. and Canada trade policy for Cuba's foreign trade and investment ministry, told Reuters. "This is a battle every country in the world is fighting, including Canada itself."   Tokmakjian generally aimed higher than common bureaucrats, according to the court's sentencing document. Even so, higher level officials' salaries are not more than $25 a month, although like other Cubans they receive cheap housing, subsidized food and other welfare benefits. Among those the court said received Tokmakjian's gifts was Cuba's vice-minister of the sugar ministry, Nelson Labrada. He was the highest-ranking of the 14 Cuban defendants and sentenced to 20 years. Wikimedia CommonsVaradero beach resort, one of the vacations Tokmakjian scheduled for an official. According to the court document, Tokmakjian courted him in 2008, paying for a week-long vacation in the Cuban beach resort Varadero that included the official’s wife and children. The vacations were repeated in 2009 and 2010, costing around $1,200 each time. Sometimes using subordinates to pay for the treats, Tokmakjian would invite Labrada to expensive dinners and take him for a cruise on a yacht. He bought him a plastic pool and a barbecue. When the barbecue broke after three months, he replaced it, the court document said. It also said Tokmakjian paid for similar vacations for Manuel Fernandez, the vice president of a state company financing Cuba's sugar industry. Labrada and Fernandez have not commented publicly on the charges against them. Fernandez's attorney said he could not immediately comment on the case and Labrada's lawyer could not be reached. Tokmakjian's companies generated $11.7 million in sales to the sugar ministry from 2009 to 2011 plus another $4.7 million in sugar-related business in 2010 and 2011. The court said that when Labrada went on a trip to Canada, a Tokmakjian subordinate took him shopping, buying him a 24-inch flat-screen television. He took both sugar officials to Niagara Falls and invited them to a casino in Toronto, buying chips for them to play with. Each ended up winning $2,500 at the gaming tables, the court said. Now, like Tokmakjian, they are facing long prison terms. FREE AppDownload

© AFP/File Sajjad HussainEmployees hang just-washed donated cotton clothes that will be used to make cloth sanitary napkins at non-profit organisation 'Goonj' (Echo) in New Delhi on April 22, 2014New Delhi (AFP) - The latest commercial for Procter and Gamble's top-selling brand of sanitary pads in India ticks all the usual boxes -- a young woman jogs happily in pristine white trousers, before effortlessly winning a tennis tournament. But unlike most adverts of its ilk, this 30-second clip seeks to dispel the myths surrounding women's periods in a country where deep-rooted social taboos around menstruation still persist. It ends with the catchphrase "touch the pickle", a reference to the widely held belief that a jar of pickle touched by a menstruating woman will spoil -- and an exhortation to young Indian women to reject such superstitions. Procter and Gamble, the US consumer goods giant behind some of the world's biggest brands, said it was astonished to learn that such "primitive practices" remained prevalent in modern-day India. A survey by the company and market researcher IPSOS showed that 59 percent of urban women still follow their grandmothers' advice not to touch the earthenware jar of pickles found in kitchens across India. "Not touching a jar of pickle because your body is undergoing a natural biological process is nothing but laughable," a company spokeswoman told AFP. The practice stems from the belief -- still widely held in India -- that menstruating women are "impure". In rural pockets, many are still made to sleep separately and eat from plates set aside especially for them during their periods. Other taboos include entering temples and watering plants like basil that are considered holy. Aditi Gupta, who started a website called menstrupedia.com two years ago to provide young people with information, said such beliefs were pervasive throughout India.  "The myths get passed on from one generation to another without any questioning," she told AFP. "It's got nothing to do with how educated people are. There is an inherent shame which inhibits people from even talking about the taboos." Encouraged by the response to the website, Gupta has launched a comic book to help people "overcome their own shame" and discuss menstruation openly. Gupta said she was motivated by her own experiences of growing up and the challenges she faced as a teen. "Although I belonged to a very well-to-do family, we had to use discarded cloth during periods, which we had to wash and reuse," she said. "It was not about affordability. It was because of the shame associated with buying sanitary napkins."   - Dispelling shame -   A. Muruganantham has made it his mission to dispel the shame surrounding menstruation in India. A school dropout from a poor family in southern India, he invented a simple machine to make cheap sanitary pads -- revolutionising menstrual health for rural women in the process. Muruganantham was inspired by the realisation that lack of access to affordable sanitary products meant his wife had to use dirty rags instead. He went to great lengths to test his invention, creating a fake uterus from a football bladder by punching a couple of holes in it and filling it with goat's blood. In his course of his research, he came across some villages where menstruating women were confined in a small room with no lights. "While many of these restrictions are not followed now, the basic idea of a woman being impure is still deeply ingrained in the minds of people," he told AFP. "Some 10-15 women are cramped together in a small room. Food is thrown at them from the door and they are forced to eat like dogs from one plate." Both Gupta and Muruganantham believe the myths can only be shattered through better communication and awareness. "It sends shivers down the spine to think that some things have not changed in India despite the progress we have made otherwise," said Muruganantham. "We have to bring the napkin out of the closet. We have to encourage women to speak out loud 'yes I am having my periods, so what'?"   FREE AppDownload
AP Images With the US unemployment rate now at 5.9%, the siren calls for the Federal Reserve to begin raising rates sooner rather than later will get louder. Here's why they are still likely to be ignored. In 1986 Milton Friedman wrote: A lower level of unemployment is an indication that there is an excess demand for labor that will produce upward pressure on real wage rates. A higher level of unemployment is an indication that there is an excess supply of labor that will produce downward pressure on real wage rates. This observation is the basis of the Phillips curve. Named for the economist A.W.H. Phillips, it suggests that there is an inverse relationship between the rate of inflation and the unemployment rate. What it means is that when the unemployment rate falls below the so-called non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU) — usually assumed to be between 5.5-6.5% — economists expect inflation to start picking up. With the unemployment rate now below 6%, some economists believe that we are either nearing or already bumping up against that threshold. As Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Richard Fisher told Reuters last month: Declines in the unemployment rate below 6.1% exert significantly higher wage pressures than if the rate is above 6.1%. But how good is the evidence for Fisher's concerns? Not very good, according to UCLA economics professor Roger Farmer.  If there was a permanent natural rate of unemployment below which we could expect inflation to start rising, then this should be evident in the data. Unfortunately, the evidence presented by Farmer suggests that, far from being a constant, the NAIRU varies widely: NBER If the NAIRU was fixed you would expect to see the averages cluster around it and form a vertical line. Instead the relationship seems to shift randomly. This suggests that it is extremely difficult to know in advance at what point declines in unemployment rate risk higher inflation. So what will Fed policymakers be paying attention to? Wages. As Janet Yellen said in August (emphasis added): This pattern of subdued real wage gains suggests that nominal compensation could rise more quickly without exerting any meaningful upward pressure on inflation. And, since wage movements have historically been sensitive to tightness in the labor market, the recent behavior of both nominal and real wages point to weaker labor market conditions than would be indicated by the current unemployment rate.

REUTERS/Denis BalibouseThe real advantages of flying private are about more than comfort.Which is more valuable? Time or money? As it turns out, if you can save one, you can save the other. Private jets are a way to make that win-win happen. Sure, private jets are swanky. But if you can spend less money to get an equally luxurious experience in first or business class, why not fly with an airline? A quick search turns up one-way first class flights from New York to Los Angeles for about $1,000. The same flight with private jet charter company JetSuite costs over $4,500 per passenger. That's a lot of money to justify for the added luxury of having no one else around.  To find out what the real benefits to flying private are, we spoke with Steve Cass, vice president of communications at private jet maker Gulfstream. It all comes down to saving time, which means saving money. It starts on the way to the airport. Small jets don't need the huge runways and staffs offered by major airports, so they can fly out of smaller spots. There are many more minor airports than major ones, so you often don't have to travel as far to get to one. And they're less congested, making the experience more pleasant. You don't have to deal with the TSA or long check-in lines, so you can you arrive at airport minutes, not hours, in advance. That's time, money, and aggravation saved. And when you get off, your bags are thrown right into your car, so there's no time spent at the baggage carousel. Plus, you fly when you want. Flying commercial, Cass said, "we adjust our schedule to meet the needs of the airline." In the sphere of private aviation, it's the other way around. Private flights aren't tied to the same hub and spoke networks used by airlines, so if your plane has enough fuel capacity to reach your destination, you'll go direct. "That saves a huge amount of time," Cass said. Private jets are usually designed to climb faster than airliners, so they're above crummy weather sooner. They usually fly faster, too. Commercial jets cruise around 35,000 feet; smaller jets typically fly higher. That puts them above the traffic, so their routes are more direct — they don't compete with bigger planes for space. The extra flexibility lets the jets capture better winds and avoid adverse weather, too. On top of moving faster and wasting less time, it's easier to get work done in the air when you're alone. Even in first or business class, Cass pointed out, it's risky to have confidential conversations, because you don't know who may be around. He also directed us to a 2009 survey by the National Business Aviation Association. Respondents rated themselves as 20% more productive while on company aircraft than in the office. Their counterparts flying commercial reported a 40% drop in productivity. So the next time you wonder why companies spend tens of millions to buy their own jets instead of putting employees on commercial fights, know that it's not about creature comforts. It's about saving time and money. [An earlier version of this post was written by Alex Davies.] FREE AppDownload

Rusty Clark/FlickrWashington's new rules aimed at stopping US companies from fleeing high corporate tax rates at home by acquiring foreign companies have succeeded in derailing a pharmaceuticals tie-up. Salix Pharmaceuticals, based in North Carolina, has abandoned its deal with Italy's Cosmo, citing a "changed political environment," in a move that could raise questions for other pending deals. The American company had announced plans to pay $2.7 billion in stock for Cosmo's Irish subsidiary in July in a deal that would allow Salix to move its tax base abroad in a practice known as inversion. But Carolyn Logan, boss of Salix, said the Obama administration's recent crackdown on inversion deals, which introduced a string of measures to make the tax benefits less attractive, had raised too many questions. "The changed political environment has created more uncertainty regarding the potential benefits we expected to achieve," she said. Cosmo boss Alessandro Della Cha said the termination of the deal would not hurt his company. "The deal with Salix showed the potential of three products of ours for US," he said. "The development path of the pipeline continued in the meantime, so this termination has no effect on value creation." Salix will pay Cosmo a breakup fee of $25 million. America last month took its first concrete steps to curb tax inversion, following months of controversy over a rising tide of what President Barack Obama branded "unpatriotic" deals. The rules are designed to make “tax inversion” schemes less financially attractive, and they apply to all deals that have not yet been finalised. They include a ban on so-called hopscotch loans, a practice in which loans made by the foreign entity to the US parent are classified as overseas property and therefore not taxed as a US dividend. This accounting trick can create significant savings in an inverted company, so its prohibition was thought to be one of the most punitive measures from Washington. Salix's termination of the deal could raise questions for other pending deals like Chicago-based AbbVie's takeover of London-listed Shire. However analysts have pointed out that this deal could yield significant tax savings even without the traditional benefits of inversion. FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersTraders work on the floor of the New York Stock ExchangeBy Ryan Vlastelica NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures were higher on Friday as investors looked ahead to a jobs report that was expected to sharply rebound from the previous month, though indexes were on track for a second straight weekly decline. * The September payroll report, due at 8:30 a.m. EDT (1230 GMT), is seen showing 215,000 jobs added in the month, up from 142,000 in August. As well, the jobless rate probably held at a six-year low, which could support bets that the Federal Reserve will raise rates in mid-2015. * Equities have been volatile of late. Over the past 250 sessions, the S&amp;P 500 posted an average daily move of 14.7 points, which it has topped each day in the past seven sessions. The benchmark index fell as much as 1 percent on Thursday, at one point dropping under its 150-day moving average - a level it had not breached since November 2012 - before rebounding sharply. It closed little changed. * For the week, the Dow is down 1.8 percent, the S&amp;P is down 1.9 percent and the Nasdaq is down 1.8 percent. It is the second straight weekly decline for all three. The CBOE Volatility index , a measure of investor anxiety, is up about 30 percent over the past two weeks, though at 16.16 on Friday, it remains below its long-term average of 20. * The week's losses were largely driven by news of the first diagnosis of a patient with Ebola in the United States. Protests in Hong Kong added to the tension, with investors worried a protracted period of unrest would weigh on growth in both Hong Kong and China. * The leader of Hong Kong, Leung Chun-ying, agreed to open talks with the pro-democracy activists, a move that was taken as a sign of progress, though he refused to stand down and violence continued in the city. * In company news, a Swiss newspaper reported that UBS  could face a fine of up to $6.3 billion if found guilty in a French investigation into whether it helped wealthy customers there avoid taxes. Futures snapshot at 0648 EDT: * S&amp;P 500 e-minis  were up 8 points, or 0.41 percent, with 113,423 contracts changing hands. * Nasdaq 100 e-minis  were up 14 points, or 0.35 percent, in volume of 17,587 contracts. * Dow e-minis  were up 55 points, or 0.33 percent, with 16,433 contracts changing hands.

Economists who have loudly and consistently predicted the onset of runaway inflation ever since the Fed launched "quantitative easing" have been completely wrong. But there's no denying that even a moderate rate of inflation destroys the value of money over the long term. For a quick reminder of this, check out the "1938 cost of living" snapshot below. It was recently tweeted out by "Classic Pics." Harvard Tuition: $420 a year. A gallon of gas: 10 cents. Movie ticket: 25 cents Postage stamp: 3 cents Average income: $1,731 per year House: $3,900 Classic Pics Yes, this was still in the middle of the Depression, when prices were low. But still. It's scary to invest in stocks, because you can lose a lot of money quickly. But over the long haul, stocks offer inflation protection, because companies pass price increases through to their customers. If you just hoard cash for the long term, meanwhile, you're pretty much guaranteed to lose. FREE AppDownload

REUTERS/Arnd WiegmannSwiss bank UBS CEO Sergio Ermotti at a May 6 news conference to present the company's results of the first quarter in Zurich.Switzerland's largest bank UBS could face a fine of up to $6.3 billion if found guilty in a French investigation into whether it helped wealthy customers there avoid tax, a Swiss newspaper reported on Friday. A French court has already ordered UBS to deposit a 1.1 billion-euro ($1.4 billion) guarantee to cover a portion of potential fines in the case, but Swiss newspaper Le Temps said it had seen a legal document showing the bank could face a penalty of up to five billion euros. The document, written by two judges, is dated July 23, the same day the bank was first ordered by French officials to pay the guarantee. Le Temps quoted the document as saying "the business model of UBS Switzerland was to offer its clients bank secrecy in contradiction to (French) fiscal authorities." An official for UBS was not immediately available for comment. The bank issued a strongly worded condemnation of the 1.1 billion euro demand when it was issued in July. Last month, the bank said it would again appeal against a French court ruling demanding the payment after an initial appeal was turned down. Shares in UBS were down 1.9 percent at 0829 GMT, lagging the European banking sector which was up 0.8 percent. On top of the French case, UBS is also dealing with allegations it was involved in rigging foreign exchange rates. The bank warned earlier this week it faced new fines after confirming it was holding talks to settle these allegations. (Reporting by Joshua Franklin; Editing by Mark Potter) FREE AppDownload
There’s been a substantial amount of criticism thrown in the direction of those who predicted high inflation since the financial crisis.  Yesterday’s piece by Bloomberg sparked a lot of conversation on the matter as it shined the spotlight on some very prominent investors and economists regarding their 2010 “open letter to Ben Bernanke” which said QE would cause high inflation and dollar devaluation.  The Bloomberg reporters asked the original signatories if they thought their prediction had been wrong and they almost universally responded by saying “we weren’t wrong, we are just early”.   Let’s be blunt – they’re not early.  They’ve been wrong.  And it matters.  A lot. First, in addition to high inflation the signatories also cited market distortions.  This is a concern I actually agree with, but the whole market distortion aspect of QE shouldn’t surprise anyone.  After all, the Fed itself has stated clearly that one of the main purposes of QE is to keep asset prices “higher than they otherwise would be”.  In other words, the Fed is explicitly trying to distort markets.  That’s basically the whole goal of the portfolio rebalancing effect.  It’s something I’ve criticized the Fed for and I think there’s a reasonable argument that this sort of policy could have negative consequences. The inflation predictions are more problematic in my view because they’re often the result of obvious misunderstandings that have directly led not only to poor investment decisions, but poor policy decisions.  For instance, I’ve harshly criticized this list of economists for their predictions about how QE could result in inflation at some point.  In essence, there was a huge list of prominent people who said QE was the equivalent of “money printing” which would lead to high inflation because they thought the reserves the Fed was creating would somehow “get out” or be “lent out” and flood the economy with excess money.  I’ve noted, ad infinitum, how this is based on an incorrect understanding of the monetary system.  There was absolutely no merit to the idea that QE would cause hyperinflation or high inflation following the crisis and those who understood the operational realities of QE knew this in advance. This matters because many of these inflation predictions were based on misunderstandings of the monetary system and models that are simply wrong.  Oftentimes these predictions were highly politicized and the result of how politics has invaded our economic understandings.  So it’s not surprising that many of the original signatories don’t want to admit being wrong because it could mean that their ideology is based on serious underlying flaws.   That’s a tough pill to swallow.  But it’s important that we indentify these mistakesbecause we should all learn from them and ensure that we don’t repeat them.  There’s too much politics in economics and these sorts of ideologically driven misunderstandings are directly hurting the economy. And we’re all worse off because of it. FREE AppDownload
REUTER/Mike SegarFriday is Jobs Day in America.The jobs report is on Friday.  On Friday morning, the BLS will release its September report on nonfarm payrolls. Last month, the jobs report disappointed, with nonfarm payrolls gains in August coming in at 142,000, well below expectations for 230,000. August's report also marked the first time in six months that payroll gains came in below 200,000. A revision of August's number on Friday, however, could repair that streak. Here is what Wall Street is looking for on Friday: The labor force participation rate is also closely watched by investors, and last month came in at 62.8%, down from 62.9% in August.  Friday's jobs report also comes at the end of what has been a rough week for stocks, with Thursday marking a particularly ugly day for European markets after the latest monetary policy announcement from the ECB. The Federal Reserve, which of course closely monitors the labor market, is set to wind down its quantitative easing program at its next policy meeting, scheduled for Oct. 28-29. Inflation and the strength of the labor market are keys the Fed will watch after concluded QE as it considers when to begin raising interest rates. In a note to clients, Jay Feldman at Credit Suisse said he expects the report to show payrolls grew by 215,000 in September. "While payrolls stumbled in August, the big picture labor market story has not changed materially. Job growth remains in healthy territory on a trend basis, and labor market slack continues to erode steadily," Feldman wrote. This estimate includes the return of 25,000 employees who went on strike at Market Basket in New England during August. Paul Dales at Capital Economics, who expects the report to show nonfarm payrolls grew 225,000 in September, notes that 6,500 casino workers who lost their jobs in Atlantic City last month could offset some of the Market Basket gains. At High Frequency Economics, Jim O'Sullivan expects nonfarm payrolls to grow by 195,000 with the unemployment remaining at 6.1%. O'Sullivan also notes that, "Payrolls have tended to be underreported initially in recent years, but the pattern has been especially pronounced in August and September." Joe LaVorgna at Deutsche Bank sees payrolls growing by 200,000 in September with the unemployment rate falling to 6%. Brian Jones at Societe Generale sees payrolls growing by 260,000, the highest expectation among Wall Street economists followed by Business Insider. Other notably bullish predictions include Dean Maki at Barclays and Maury Harris at UBS, who both see payrolls growing by 250,000. Peter D'Antonio at Citi has the lowest prediction among economists followed by Business Insider, expecting payrolls to grow by just 175,000 in September. This chart shows the monthly growth in nonfarm payrolls this year. Andy Kiersz/Business Insider Business Insider will have wall-to-wall live coverage of the jobs report Friday morning.

Thomson ReutersVisitors look at a Bentley Mulsanne car displayed on media day at the Paris Mondial de l'AutomobileBy Andreas Cremer PARIS (Reuters) - Bentley, the venerable British carmaker known for comfort and style, is moving into the fast lane of ultra-luxury cars with a new version of its flagship saloon, aiming to grab a bigger slice of a market tipped to double in size by 2018. The 95-year-old brand, whose customers include Queen Elizabeth II and the Sultan of Brunei, is using this month's Paris auto show to launch the Mulsanne Speed under the strapline "the world's fastest ultra-luxury driving experience." At 324,000 euros ($411,000), the model is not only Bentley's most expensive ever, but the eight-cylinder engine with a new combustion system will allow it to reach 100 kilometers per hour in 4.9 seconds and deliver a top speed of 305 kph (190 mph). The launch is part of a diversification that will also see the Volkswagen-owned business branch into luxury sport-utility vehicles (SUVs) in 2016. Such expansion is nothing new. Indeed, Bentley chief executive Wolfgang Duerheimer may be trying to replicate the success he had as R&amp;D chief at Volkswagen (VW) luxury stablemate Porsche, where he extended a range of two-seater sports cars to embrace SUVs and coupés. But analysts say it is vital if Bentley is to secure a larger share of a rapidly-growing market. Deliveries of cars priced at 120,000 euros or more may almost double to about 133,000 vehicles by 2018 from 70,000 last year as the ranks of the super wealthy in the United States and China keep growing, according to forecaster IHS Automotive. "The super-rich don't care about brand loyalty," Frankfurt-based IHS analyst Henner Lehne said. "They buy whichever model is hot." With a dark tint finish applied to exterior grilles and wing vents, Bentley believes the new 5.57-metre version of the Mulsanne -- named after the fastest stretch of the Le Mans race track in France -- will comfortably fit into that category. "Bentley is on the move," Duerheimer told Reuters in an interview late on Thursday. "The emphasis on performance has something to do with the lifestyle of our customers, it's part of their superlative aspirations." Though Bentley accounted for just 0.1 percent of VW's record 9.73 million vehicle sales last year, it gives the German parent an aura of technical prowess while carrying out key research tasks, especially on engine technology. Bentley has set a target to boost sales by about half to 15,000 vehicles by 2018, as part of VW's goal to overtake Toyota as the world's biggest carmaker.  GRAND PLANS Duerheimer, who returned to Bentley in June after a brief stint as R&amp;D boss at VW's Audi division, oversaw Porsche's push into SUVs in 2002 with the Cayenne, now the brand's top-selling model accounting for about half its deliveries. In 2011-2012 when he first took the reins, he developed the business case and technology blueprint for the Bentley SUV which will be the world's most expensive four-by-four costing more than 160,000 euros. A former racing engineer at BMW's motorcycle division who still drives a BMW GS model and touts a 365 kph personal speed record set in a Bugatti Veyron, Duerheimer's affection for performance is blatant. He previously steered the launch of various performance-focused models at Bentley such as the Continental Supersports convertible which set a new world ice speed record at 331 kph. James Medcalf, head of the Bentley Drivers' Club representing 3,500 enthusiasts around the world and owner of half a dozen Bentleys, said luxury and comfort remained the brand's top goals but performance was increasingly important. "If you add more steps at the top of the ladder, many people will want to go there," the 78-year-old told Reuters. "The Speed version will add excitement to the Mulsanne." Once production of the SUV is fully underway by autumn 2015, Bentley will decide on a possible fifth model line, Duerheimer said. Options include a two-seater sporty vehicle, a model to plug the 100,000-euro gap between the Flying Spur and Mulsanne saloons and new variants of the Continental GT, he said. The brand also plans to introduce hybrid petrol/electric engines to about 90 percent of its lineup by about 2020, and aims to build a new R&amp;D center and expand its operations in and around its Crewe, England-based headquarters, where it lacks a test track and other technical facilities, Duerheimer said. Upgrading Bentley may take a decade and will require funding not yet approved by parent VW, he added. The brand is already spending almost 1 billion euros on the SUV and other models. "We have grand plans," Duerheimer said. "The Mulsanne Speed gives proof of that." (1 US dollar = 0.7882 euro)  (Editing by Mark Potter) FREE AppDownload
Retail Week, YoutubeJohn Lewis, the retailer regularly voted the UK’s best by customers, has a pretty friendly brand. Its mutual business model is regularly praised as one for the entire country to copy. So you might have expected, after being awarded the status of one of the world's best retailers in Paris this week, managing director Andy Street to have some kind words to say about his French hosts. Not quite. He says the country is "finished." Speaking in London on Thursday, The Times reports that John Lewis' most senior executive said: “I have never been to a country more ill at ease … nothing works, and worse, nobody cares about it.” “If you’ve got investments in French businesses, get them out quickly.”  The Times is describing his comments as tongue in cheek, but the French embassy certainly wasn’t happy with the comments, saying that “obviously many foreign businesses do not seem to share Mr. Street’s view.”  Street even slammed the quality of the plastic award he picked up in Paris as “frankly revolting.” “If I needed any further evidence of a country in decline, here it is.” Street has now issued an apology, according to the BBC. He said: "The remarks I made were supposed to be lighthearted views, and tongue in cheek." "On reflection I clearly went too far. I regret the comments, and apologize unreservedly" The rant came just weeks after France's own prime minister said the French government would be "foutu" (a colorful French phrase meaning ruined, or something ruder) if it didn't turn the country's stagnant economy around within six months. The country is currently plagued by high unemployment that simply won't fall, and there's no sign of any significant growth or inflation. So Street might actually be right, even if he's regretting the outburst a little Friday morning. FREE AppDownload
Wikimedia CommonsThe financial markets have revisited two peaks not seen since the crash of 2007-2008: IPOs in London and deal volume in tech and media companies globally BOTH hit new highs. Let's deal with tech first, via a paper from the Jordan Edmiston Group: The media, information, marketing and technology sectors saw 1,128 transactions worth $94 billion announced in the first three quarters of 2014. Deal volume increased slightly over 2013, but Facebook’s $19 billion acquisition of mobile messaging app WhatsApp in Q1 and several other mega transactions drove deal value to more than double 2013’s $45 billion ... Here's the chart (below). Note that although the value declined a little in Q3 2014, the total volume is up, and value is also up when you look at the first nine months of the year vs. 2013: Jordan Edmiston Group Facebook's massive $19 billion deal for Whatsapp earlier this year has a distorting effect here. But still, if you're looking for a sign that the market is overpaying for high-cost assets, this might be it. At the same time, IPOs floating on the London stock markets have also hit a new record, according to EY (via the Financial Times): UK flotation activity has already surpassed the total for the whole of last year, with 80 initial public offerings raising £12.2bn – the highest level for the London IPO market since 2007, according to EY. ... EY said there were 19 IPOs during the third quarter, raising funds of £1.4bn, with the momentum experienced during the first half of the year continuing into what is usually the quiet holiday period making it the busiest summer for IPOs for seven years. So that's two peaks, both coming at the same time. Just for the record. FREE AppDownload

REUTERS/Brian SnyderSt. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard.(Reuters) - St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said that manufacturing jobs are returning to the U.S. but not in sufficient numbers to drive the economy. "I think manufacturing jobs are coming back, but it's not a large macro-economic event," Bullard said in a question and answer session here following a speech to a local business group. Bullard also said he would support a more tiered regulatory system that would help ease regulations on community banks. FREE AppDownload
AP Photo NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc &lt;gs.n&gt; is considering raising a new infrastructure fund, according to three people familiar with the matter, even as U.S. regulations threaten to reduce its profits from such endeavors. The bank's plans are tentative and in the early stages, and there is currently no fundraising process or target size for the fund, the sources cautioned. Goldman Sachs declined to comment. When Goldman last raised an infrastructure fund in 2010, it met with lukewarm demand. Like that fund, the one being envisaged would have a global focus with a mandate to buy a variety of infrastructure assets, such as airports, power grids and toll roads. In recent years investors such as pensions and insurers have grown increasingly keen on infrastructure funds, as they look for assets that are safer than stocks but offer better returns than low-yielding bonds. Under a federal regulation known as the "Volcker Rule," part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform act, a bank cannot own more than 3 percent of an infrastructure fund or any other private equity-type fund. The regulation is meant to limit banks' bets on risky assets.  Before the Volcker rule, Goldman would typically invest around 10 percent of the capital in an infrastructure fund it set up and 30 to 35 percent of its private equity funds. There is a loophole in the rule, though. A bank can spend as much of its own money as it likes to buy infrastructure assets like roads and airports, or invest in the kinds of corporate assets owned by private equity firms, provided it doesn't use a fund that includes outside investors. The bank is taking that route with private equity, as Reuters first reported last year. For example, it is currently leading a deal to acquire Neovia Logistics LLC, which helps companies with inventory management and warehousing, Reuters reported last week. But the bank is reluctant to use that loophole for infrastructure assets, because the potential returns are usually only about half the 18 to 20 percent it can earn from private equity investments. The bank will earn a management fee and likely a 20 percent cut of fund profits, but will not earn much in the way of additional returns given the 3 percent limit on its investment. Infrastructure assets, such as ports, toll roads and airports, may offer lower returns than private equity investments, but they are also lower risk, because they typically operate through government-granted monopolies. Signs that Goldman is going to make most of its infrastructure investments with other peoples' money, while making riskier private equity investments with its own money, underscore how the Volcker rule may have unintended consequences. The rule was designed to make banks safer, but it may be encouraging banks to focus their own money on riskier assets, instead of making bets on a range of assets from the relatively safe to the risky. Goldman Sachs is thinking about its next infrastructure fund now in part because its second and most recent such fund, raised before the Volcker rule in 2010, has invested about 65 percent of the capital pledged to it, one of the sources said. (The fund sought to raise about $7.5 billion, but ended up getting less than half that.) Managers of alternative investments like infrastructure funds typically begin raising a new vehicle when the previous fund is about 75 percent invested. U.S. banks have taken varied approaches to infrastructure funds after the Volcker rule. Citigroup Inc &lt;c.n&gt;, for example, is winding down its infrastructure investment unit, while Morgan Stanley &lt;ms.n&gt; is currently aiming to raise $4 billion for an infrastructure fund. It has so far raised more than $1.5 billion, it said in regulatory filings in July. Strong demand has helped the average size of infrastructure funds raised so far this year increase by 44 percent compared with the corresponding period in 2013, according to market research firm Preqin.

Thomson ReutersBill Gross, cofounder and co-chief investment officer of PIMCO.Pimco CEO Doug Hodge played defense on Thursday, reiterating that Bill Gross’s departure has not affected the way the US bond giant functions. “With Bill’s recent decision to resign, the perception has been that there has been a dramatic shift at Pimco,” Hodge said in a letter to clients on Pimco's website. “However, the reality is that while Pimco has evolved into a globally diversified investment company, our DNA is fundamentally unchanged.” Pacific Investment Management Co. suffered a record $23.5 billion of withdrawals from its flagship Pimco Total Return Fund in September, with its largest daily outflow occurring on the day of Gross's surprise resignation from the firm on Sept. 26. The Newport Beach, California-based fund manager said the Pimco Total Return Fund, run by Gross for 27 years who made it into the world's largest bond fund, is "well positioned" to meet potential redemptions. The Pimco Total Return Fund has now experienced 17 straight months of outflows, totaling $92.3 billion. Assets under management have fallen below $200 billion, down from a peak of $292.9 billion in April 2013. In his letter, Hodge said: “Our investment process, which lies at the heart of the value we offer clients, is ingrained – it is stamped into our DNA. Our culture of rigorous and open debate will continue to animate quarterly forums of our global investment and executive leadership, as well as the daily meetings of the Investment Committee. We remain a team-oriented organization.” Hodge told Reuters on Sunday that over the past five years, Pimco has expanded into far more parts of the fixed income market and into other asset classes and other geographies. “The Pimco Total Return Fund does not define Pimco. It's an important flagship product of this firm, but it is not our only strategy," he said. Pimco, he said, has grown to nearly 2,500 investment professionals and staff stationed in 13 global offices, with nearly $2 trillion in assets and a full suite of strategies, including core fixed income, income, real return, enhanced equities, active equities, commodities, active ETFs and alternatives. “As is well known, teamwork at PIMCO is not about Kumbaya and participation awards. It is about inclusion and results – and delivering excellence to our clients,” Hodge said. Pimco recently named 16-year Pimco veteran Daniel Ivascyn as Group Chief Investment Officer with “an exceptional investing track record,” Hodge said. Morningstar named Ivascyn 2013 Fixed-Income Fund Manager of the Year. “There are a number of traits that describe Dan. He is smart, driven and decisive, yet inclusive and measured. But his modesty should not be mistaken for lack of resolve,” Hodge said. “Dan is a leader in the true sense of the word: He motivates his team to deliver by setting an example for all of those who work with him. In short, he is pure PIMCO.” (Reporting by Jennifer Ablan in New York; Editing by Ken Wills) FREE AppDownload

REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton  ">Thomson ReutersSign for a RadioShack store is seen in the Brighton Beach section of the Brooklyn borough in New York(Reuters) - Cash-strapped electronics retailer RadioShack Corp has reached an agreement with a consortium led by its largest shareholder Standard General LP to refinance about $590 million of loans to re-stock ahead of the holiday season, Bloomberg reported, citing a person familiar with the matter. The New York-based hedge fund will lead a group of lenders to refinance debt outstanding under a $535 million asset-backed revolving credit line from GE Capital, the lending unit of General Electric Co, Bloomberg said. (http://bloom.bg/1uFZbO0) RadioShack said last month it may need to file for bankruptcy protection if its cash situation worsens. The company said it was also exploring other options, including a sale or an investment, and liquidation as the last resort. Last week, Standard General said it was in talks to improve RadioShack's cash position ahead of the crucial holiday season. The hedge fund also raised its stake in RadioShack to 9.8 percent from 7.08 percent, becoming the company's largest shareholder. Standard General and certain new investors would invest in the credit facility, and the investors have committed to provide draft financing to fund the transaction, the hedge fund said in a regulatory filing. RadioShack and Standard General did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside regular U.S. business hours.
