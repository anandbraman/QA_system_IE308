A handful of big companies, including NYSE Euronext, will release earnings reports before the market closes. Here's what you need to know: These are the companies that will release earnings reports before the market closes:
China's services PMI report is red hot. From the report: The HSBC China Composite PMI data (which covers both manufacturing and services) signalled a further expansion of business activity during January. Output at the composite level has now increased for five successive months, with January posting a solid rate of expansion, the fastest in two years. The HSBC China Composite Output Index posted 53.5 in January, up from 51.8 in December. Output across both the manufacturing and service sectors increased simultaneously for the third month in a row in January. Manufacturers signalled a marked rate of expansion in the context of historical data, while growth in the service sector was solid, as signalled by the HSBC China Services Business Activity Index recording 54.0 in January, up from 51.7.

On February 24-25, Italy goes to the polls to elect its new parliament. The big fears is that Berlusconi might do better than expected, increasing the risk of an ungovernable country. This concern helped contribute to a massive walloping in the Italian stock market today. It was down 4.5%. For the next 20 days, everyone will be watching this chart to see if the blue line (Berlusconi) keeps trending up, and if the red line (the left coalition) keeps going down.

APPresident Barack Obama signed the¬†"No Budget, No Pay Act of 2013" into law Monday night, the White House said, officially suspending the nation's debt limit through May 18. The bill also suspends pay for members of Congress if their chamber does not pass a budget resolution by April 15. The Senate had passed the debt ceiling bill last week, and the House passed it the week before. The two chambers passed the bill along different lines. The House saw fairly strong bipartisan support for the bill. But in the Senate, it passed largely on partisan lines. Republican Senators said they voted against it because of a lack of spending cuts that accompanied the debt-limit increase. The¬†debt-ceiling bill is not technically a clean hike¬†in the nation's debt limit. It's a suspension of the debt ceiling for a certain time period. On May 19, the debt limit will be raised by an amount "necessary to fund commitment incurred by the Federal Government that required payment."  The Bipartisan Policy Center estimates that number will be around $450 billion. The BPC also estimates that the next point the nation will need to raise the debt limit will come in August. The next budget fight will come with the looming sequester¬†of vast, across-the-board spending cuts set to kick in on March 1.¬†
China is witnessing a recovery in the property market that was largely fueled by developers cutting prices and local city governments loosening policy. Real estate according to Lan Shen and Stephen Green of Standard Chartered, is the "pre-eminent driver of China's growth, officially accounting for 12.4% of output in 2012".† In a proprietary survey of 30 mainland developers, Shen and Green found 25 developers said they expect to be building more in 2013 than in the previous year, and 18 said they plan to buy land in the next three - six months. Standard Chartered † "As such, the findings of our survey suggest that 2013 will be a stronger year than 2012, not only for China<U+201F>s economy but for others too," write Shen and Green. But it isn't all positive. Developers said that while they are seeing a recovery in real demand for homes, inventories weren't being cleared fast enough. What's more financing conditions are deteriorating for small developers and the number of defaults are on the rise. And some warn of a bubble reforming in the sector. From the South China Morning Post:  †"This is not a welcome shift," warn Mark Williams and Wang Qinwei at independent research house Capital Economics. They argue that China is already at risk of over-investing in property, pointing out that at the height of America's real-estate bubble, investment in the sector only reached 6 per cent of GDP. "By that standard, China is now well into dangerous territory. Williams and Wang estimate there is demand in China for about 10 million new homes a year. Despite last year's slowdown, they reckon almost 11 million new properties were completed in 2011. "Considering the amount of construction that was put on hold during the slump, they believe the current investment recovery could push the number of new homes completed this year up to 17 million. "That is far more than the market can realistically support without a big drop in prices," they warn." China's property market is still one that investors should be watching closely.

Credit markets are off to a pretty crazy start this year. On January 3, Goldman Sachs was already closing out its #2 trade recommendation¬†for 2013 ‚Äì a long position in high-yield debt ‚Äì on account of an astonishing rally that began in November. Goldman strategists weren't the only ones surprised by the swift move. Citi strategist Matt King expressed a similar sentiment in a note to clients on January 4, writing, "While CDS has already shot through our 2013 year-end targets (!), cash still has another 20 basis points to go." Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale credit strategists Juan Estaban Valencia and Suki Mann reflected on the strong demand for credit that has underpinned the January rally in a recent note as well, writing, "We¬í‚Äôve had one of the best starts to a year in the primary markets for investment grade,¬†the best ever for high yield, and the best month for senior financials since January 2010, which underscores just how strong appetite for credit remains, even at the current pricing levels." The chart below, via BofA Merrill Lynch, shows the size of the rally in credit ‚Äì and how it has mostly tracked that in other risky assets like the S&amp;P 500 that began in November. The big spread tightening in the credit space that occurred when a deal was reached on the "fiscal cliff" is what caused so many Wall Street strategists to blow through their year-end targets only a few days into January. BofA Merrill Lynch However, that uptick circled in the chart above ‚Äì a significant sell-off in corporate debt at the end of the month ‚Äì has people talking. (A quick primer on credit investing: the "spread" refers to the difference between the yield on a corporate bond and that on a government bond. Yields on all bonds are inversely related to bond prices. So, when the spread "tightens," it either means investors are buying up more corporate bonds, sending yields on those bonds lower, or they're selling government bonds, sending yields on those bonds higher.) The "Great Rotation" Versus The Real Threat At the end of January, there was a sizeable correction in credit that was not reflected in equity markets. The correction was to be expected after such an astonishing run. Now,¬†Valencia and Mann at Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale write, "the bigger question is whether we are witnessing a healthy correction or a more sustainable shift out of credit and into other asset classes." There certainly has been a lot of chatter on Wall Street lately about a "Great Rotation" out of bond funds and into equity funds, talk of which was spurred on by big equity inflows in January that actually appear to be the simple byproduct of a raft of special dividends paid out to shareholders last year. Other banks are getting the question a lot, too. Citi strategist¬†Stephen Antczak writes in a note,¬†"Many corporate investors are increasingly worried about a rotation from credit into equities, particularly one that is prompted by higher Treasury rates." While a rotation may or may not be happening ‚Äì at least, not yet ‚Äì it's undeniable that Treasury yields are rising. Last week, the yield on the 10-year Treasury climbed past 2 percent for the first time since April. Antczak says regardless of the flows, rising Treasury yields in and of themselves are a big deal for investors in corporate credit. His latest note to clients sports a rather ominous title: "How Afraid of Rising Rates Should We Be? More than usual." In the note, Antczak stresses how exposed investors in corporate debt are to rising Treasury yields and points to a few major causes for concern. The Rise Of Mutual Funds The first thing to remember, writes Antczak, is that mutual funds and ETFs together are responsible for a big portion of the marginal flows into corporate credit markets in recent years. Mutual funds now account for $1.7 trillion of the market, up 69 percent from the first quarter of 2009, and ETFs are responsible for $200 billion ‚Äì up 328 percent in the same time period. The chart below should offer a sense for the importance of mutual funds and ETFs (along with life insurers, which have also piled into corporate debt in recent years). Citi Research Antczak explains why the rise of mutual funds and ETFs in the corporate debt market ‚Äì reflecting increased access for retail investors ‚Äì is so important (emphasis added): The problem is that these investors tend to be backward-looking and sensitive to total returns, particularly negative total returns.¬†And if 10-year Treasury rates were to rise anywhere near what our economists expect (again, 2.5% by year end) total returns in the corporate market may very well be negative. And if returns do in fact turn negative, we would expect investors to scale back mutual fund investments, creating forced sellers. Forced selling is a problem when there is no one else to take the other side of the trade. Making the situation worse is the amount of risk investors in corporate credit have taken on as of late. Record Levels Of Duration Risk In Corporate Debt Markets Mark-to-market risk in corporate debt ‚Äì as measured by DV01 ‚Äì is at an all-time high. Note: The term "DV01" ¬†‚Äì short for "dollar value of an 01" ‚Äì refers to a bond's dollar duration, which simply measures the¬†amount of money a bond investor will lose on a $1 million bond investment for every 1-basis point rise in the yield on the bond. Zero interest rate monetary policy in developed economies has pushed investors to take on more and more duration risk in their portfolios. With lower interest rates across the spectrum of maturities, investors move to longer-term debt to collect yields previously available from shorter-term debt. The problem is that the value of longer-term debt is more susceptible to changes in interest rates ‚Äì hence the duration risk. In other words, corporate bond prices are¬†extremely sensitive¬†right now to a rise in interest rates. The amount of money an investor stands to lose on his or her corporate debt investment for every uptick in yields (remember, yields and bond prices are inversely related) is at historic levels. The chart below shows DV01, which Antczak characterizes in his note as "WAY above its long-term average." Citi Research Antczak writes, "Extreme mark-to-market sensitivity and extreme mark-to-market risk in a rising rate environment can‚Äôt be a good combination." The Endgame Credit markets have undergone a substantial metamorphosis in recent years as a world of ultra-low interest rates has forced more and more investors ‚Äì searching for yield opportunities ‚Äì into investment grade and high yield corporate debt. Now, everyone is on the same side of the trade. The changes in corporate bond holdings among various types of investors charted above lead Antczak to conclude that "essentially everyone that has been adding risk is real money, long-only investors." This leads to an important question, says Antczak: "If mutual funds and ETFs are forced to sell, particularly given that the Street is still not willing to boost risk positioning, who will take the other side?"¬† The answer: "Perhaps no one, at least not until valuations cheapen meaningfully." For their part, Valencia and Mann at Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale don't see the recent pull-back in corporate debt as "anything more sinister than some heightened nerves following a tightening that was overly aggressive as we kicked off the year." However, according to the two strategists, the sell-off does highlight a major concern ‚Äì the same one hinted at in the question posed by Antczak above. The Street doesn't really maintain much inventory of corporate bonds anymore. Valencia and Mann write, "the difficulties the Street faced to absorb one way flows recently highlights how vicious a more structural unwind could become (when we get sustained growth) given the lack of accommodation of emerging bonds from the Street when we get a sell-off." As mutual funds have bought up debt in recent years, dealers have seriously pared back inventories. Citi strategist Matt King highlighted this dynamic recently in one of four "charts of the year" submitted to Business Insider: ICI, NY Fed, Bloomberg, Haver Analytics, Citi Research King put it this way: "Second, market liquidity. Since 2007, credit mutual fund assets have doubled, while dealers' corporate bond inventories have halved. So while in 2007, it would have taken a 50% outflow from mutual funds to double the size of the street's inventory, now if there were to be a 5% outflow it would double the size of the inventory." Valencia and Mann point to this as a sign that "the dynamics of the market have changed in that sense," and conclude with a warning for clients: ...for now, while the going remains good for continued tightening in credit spreads, the exit will be messy. Hopefully, that's not something we need to be concerned about for some time yet. So, for the moment, we have a correction, the entry points look/are better although few will be tempted to add - until, of course, someone else goes first. All of this assumes that interest rates continue to rise in 2013 ‚Äì but that's exactly what many are forecasting right now. In the "forced selling" scenario described above, Citi's Antzcak thinks corporate credit spreads would eventually tighten "once the dust settles," but cautions that the path to that end state could be a rocky one.

Getty ImagesUPDATE: Yum! Brands' fourth-quarter earnings release is out. the company reported adjusted earnings of $0.83 per share in Q4, slightly ahead of expectations of $0.82. Revenues came in at $4.15 billion, also just above estimates of $4.12 billion. The company said same-store sales in China were down 6 percent in the quarter, partly due to¬†a probe into KFC by the Shanghai FDA. The company also said it doesn't see itself achieving earnings growth in 2013. Below are highlights from the press release: Below are sections on the China situation, the 2013 outlook, and comments from the CEO: CHINA UPDATE KFC sales in the last two weeks of the fourth quarter were significantly impacted by the intense media attention surrounding an investigation by the Shanghai FDA (SFDA) into poultry supply management at Yum! China. The investigation was prompted by a report broadcast on China‚Äôs national television (CCTV), which aired on December 18, 2012. The report showed that a few poultry farmers were ignoring laws and regulations by using excessive levels of antibiotics in chicken. Regrettably, some of this product was purchased by two poultry suppliers of KFC China. The investigation caused further media attention, including social media commentary, and this negatively affected consumer perceptions of poultry safety, and KFC in particular. On January 25, 2013, the SFDA concluded its investigation and released its recommendations. We appreciate their thorough and diligent review. The SFDA identified issues and provided ‚ÄúSupervisory Recommendations‚Äù to Yum! China to strengthen our poultry supply chain practices including refined voluntary self testing procedures, improved reporting and communications and enhanced supplier management. Our team in China has taken a comprehensive review of our current system and is in the process of incorporating all of the SFDA‚Äôs recommendations. We have always recognized the importance of building a world-class supply chain in China, which is why we have implemented a wide range of quality assurance and testing practices over the years above legal and regulatory standards. The SFDA‚Äôs recommendations will further strengthen those practices. The SFDA did not bring a case against Yum! China and no fine was assessed. The past seven weeks of media attention have been intense and negative towards the KFC brand image. Even though this is a very disappointing setback, we are more committed than ever to continue to strengthen our efforts, restore the confidence of our customers and win back their brand loyalty. To that end, the China team will soon be launching a brand reputation quality campaign to re-assure consumers of our high quality food, along with aggressive marketing plans. 2013 OUTLOOK We are confident the YRI and U.S. businesses will deliver annual operating profit growth consistent with our ongoing growth model. Given current uncertainties related to KFC sales in China, it is difficult to confidently forecast our overall financial performance. We have made the assumption that KFC China same-store sales will improve as the year progresses and will be positive in the fourth quarter. With these assumptions, we estimate a mid-single digit EPS decline in 2013 versus prior year, excluding Special Items. This includes an expectation for a significant decline in EPS performance in the first half of the year followed by EPS growth in the second half. The first quarter for our China business includes only the months of January and February and is highly impacted by consumer spending during the Chinese New Year holiday. The timing of this holiday changes each year. This year it is important to note that while the timing impact of Chinese New Year is neutral to our first quarter, there is a significant negative impact to January sales and a corresponding significant benefit to February sales due to the timing of this week-long holiday. We expect that the underlying performance of our China business will remain relatively unchanged for the balance of the first quarter, with a same-store sales decline of approximately 25% for January and February combined (China‚Äôs first quarter). DAVID NOVAK COMMENTS David C. Novak, Chairman and CEO, said, ‚ÄúWe delivered full-year 2012 EPS growth of 13% or $3.25 per share, excluding Special Items. This marks the 11th¬†consecutive year we delivered at least 13% growth, which puts us in an elite group of high-growth companies. We also take satisfaction with our record level of international development in 2012 which lays the foundation for future growth and makes Yum! a leader in emerging market development. With new-unit development at the core of our growth model and the continued rapid expansion of the consuming class overseas, we believe our opportunity for long-term growth has never been better. ‚ÄúWe are obviously proud of our track record of achieving double-digit EPS growth, and I am as confident as ever we can deliver this performance over the long term. However, as a result of adverse publicity from the poultry supply situation in mid-December, China KFC sales experienced a sharp decline. Due to continued negative same-store sales and our assumption that it will take time to recover consumer confidence, we no longer expect to achieve EPS growth in 2013. ‚ÄúAlthough we cannot predict how long it will take to restore sales, we are steadfast in our belief that the power and popularity of the KFC brand in China will ultimately drive a full sales recovery. Having weathered other storms in the past, we know that our brands are resilient. As a result, we will stay the course with our target to develop at least 700 new units in 2013 in China to lay the foundation for future growth, and will not let this event detract from our unparalleled China growth opportunity. ‚ÄúOur growth strategies are unchanged, in China, Yum! Restaurants International, India and the U.S. With our category-leading brands and outstanding people capability, I‚Äôm confident we will bounce back strongly and restore our track record of double-digit EPS growth in the years ahead.‚Äù Click here for the full release &gt; SEE ALSO: The 22 Most Controversial Stocks In America &gt;

However, at a press conference, Rajoy was forced to talk about something else entirely. "The things that are attributed to me are false. I can say it again today," Rajoy said, according to a report at CNN. Rajoy was being put on the spot about documents published last week in El Pais that appear to show his party receiving a large amount of "secret" donations. The Spanish newspaper reportedly found a secret accounting system created treasurer Luis B·rcenas, who is under investigation for allegedly having Ä22 million ($30 million) in a Swiss bank account. El Pais has not only uploaded photos of the (allegedly) secret documents, but they've put them in a searchable database.

Even with that response, this looks bad for Rajoy.

R_P_F / FlickrEssay Review of ìMurder on the Orient Express ñ The Mystery of Underperformanceî Once in a while I read something which crystalizes for me ñ with data and arguments better than I could hope to make ñ what I already suspected but hadnít yet put into words. Charles D. Ellis writes in Financial Analysis Journal[1] a research-based critique of the Financial Infotainment Industrial Complexís myth of investment manager outperformance. Using the literary conceit of Agatha Christieís Murder on the Orient Express, Ellis plays detective Hercule Poirot to uncover everyoneís guilty ñ investment managers, investment consultants, fund executives, and investment committees ñ when it comes to paying unnecessary fees to managers who inevitably underperform ëthe market.í If, like me, you kind of suspected all that, but wanted to see it demonstrated in black and white, I recommend the article.† If you want the Cliffís Notes version, hey, thatís why you come to Bankers Anonymous! The Problem As Ellis points out, everyone wants to own funds with investment returns in the top quartile; this is statistically impossible for more than 25% of investors in any year. The further grim reality is that 60% of mutual funds underperform their benchmark every year, and that number climbs to 80% underperformance over a 20-year period. Most troubling of all, Ellis cites research[2] which concludes that 24% of funds underperform their benchmark, 75% of funds match their expected market returns with no alpha[3], and 1% of funds actually offer risk-adjusted superior net returns, after costs. So about 1% of actively managed funds are really ìworth it.î† Think you can pick that 1%?[4] Ok, thatís the problem.† Whoís to blame?† Everyone in the Financial Infotainment Industrial Complex. Investment Managers How are they to blame for underperformance? Investment Consultants How are they to blame for underperformance? Fund Executives How are they to blame for underperformance? † Investment Committees How are they to blame for underperformance? † The result The logical result of the ìMurder on the Orient Expressî discovery that ìeveryone is guiltyî is that managers of pension funds and endowment tend to pay too much in fees for investment management. The Financial Infotainment Industrial Complex continually reinforces the idea that outperforming managers may be discovered at any time and that the goal of investment managers is to ëbeat the market.í But when you pay extra to ëbeat the market,í you end up, in the long run, paradoxically underperforming the market by, at least, the amount of your fees.

[4] That sounds like a rhetorical question, but there actually is a correct answer.† The answer is ìno.î [5] Itís not in Ellis paper, but this point reminds me that ëdiversificationí often prevents significant wealth creation.† Iíve written this before, but truly wealthy people who made the money in their own lifetime, inevitably have extreme concentrations of risk in only one or two assets or businesses.† Concentration of risks creates alpha, diversification creates beta.

FA Insights is a daily newsletter from Business Insider that delivers the top news and commentary for financial advisors. Bond-Heavy Investors Want To Put Their Money In Equities (The Wall St. Journal) Bond-heavy investor are looking to shift some of their assets into equities as they realize that they're carrying too much risk and missing out on returns. Financial advisors are helping their clients buy shorter-duration bonds, high-quality mortgage-backed securities, structured credit and stocks. Cooling yields and strong S&amp;P 500 performance is contributing to this shift in sentiment, Todd Morgan, senior managing director and adviser at Los Angeles-based Bel Air Investment Advisors LLC, told the WSJ. "Now, they're seeing that the stock market gave a very good return last year and in January, and they're becoming more hopeful and optimistic that they can put their toe back into the global market or increase their presence," he said. The Great Rotation Is Just A Giant Misunderstanding (Business Insider) January was a record month for flows into equity mutual funds. But that doesn't mean there's a "Great Rotation" from bonds to stocks going on. According to Citi Investment Research, a significant portion of the record flows into equities came from the mad rush of special dividends paid out by big companies to shareholders ahead of the scheduled expiration of certain Bush-era tax cuts. Citi Research, BEA, SAAR, Fed H.8 According to the BEA, those special dividends also accounted for the†unexpected surge in personal income growth†in December. US Stocks Are Expensive Right Now (Goldman Sachs Asset Management) The US, Australia and Mexico stock markets are not cheap right now, according to Goldman Sachs' Jim O'Neill. US market indexes are reaching all-time highs, so this might be a bit obvious. "Such a cautious approach does not mean these or any markets will stop rallying but it is a sign to be careful and that these markets could be especially vulnerable to disappointing and surprising news," said O'Neill in a note, adding, "Many other markets do remain quite cheap, including the other seven of our so-called Growth Markets, as well as Japan and much of continental Europe. This explains why, as I have been suggesting, I would still concentrate my bullishness there." The Stock Market Will Tank After Obama's State Of The Union Speech (Jeff Saut) Raymond James strategist Jeff Saut says that this is the 23rd day of a "buying stampede," that will probably last just till February 12th, the day President Obama is scheduled to give hs State of The Union Speech. "That address will likely be viewed negatively by the equity markets, which should serve to finally bring about a 5 - 7% correction. How the stock market reacts following such a pullback will tell us a lot about the market's future direction. In the interim I favor the upside with the caveat that this rally is long of tooth," said Saut in a note. Business Cycle is Bullish On Stocks And Commodities (Advisor Perspectives) In each business cycle there cyclical turning points for bonds, stocks and commoditiesópeak, fall, bottom out, rise, and so on. Between December and January, the economy skipped from Stage II, which is when stocks begin to recover, to Stage IV, which is when demand for credit causes bond prices to peak, according to Advisor Perspectives' Martin Pring. "That means that the current environment is negative for bonds but positive for the other two asset classes (stocks and commodities)," said Pring in a note. Advisor Perspectives

BlackRock Jeff Smith, Senior Managing Director, is BlackRock's Head of Global Human Resources Group.Long hours, high stress and what appears to be a constant pursuit of money can put a lot of stress on bankers.¬† A third of bankers admit to hating their jobs, according to a survey conducted by¬†eFinancialCareers. Large financial companies are often criticized as being greedy, impersonal institutions that demand a lot from their employees and give little in return.  They pay well, but they're not considered especially great places to work. In fact, very few financial institutions made our list of the Best Employers in America, which was based on exclusive data from PayScale. ‚ÄúBrowsing through the banks [we] noticed that there was a trend of having below typical satisfaction, flexibility, stress and job meaning scores," PayScale's data team told us. Employees at financial companies just aren't as satisfied as those in other industries.  However, not all finance companies are bad. One of the companies that made our list of Best Employers was asset management firm BlackRock,¬†which ranked number¬†30 out of the 200 companies, with 73 percent of its employees reporting high job satisfaction. The independently-run public company is now by far the fastest-growing asset manager in the world with approximately 10,500 employees worldwide. The¬†company's website¬†says that in the¬†"latest employee survey, most employees rated [the] culture as strong and meaningful, and most rated themselves highly engaged.‚Äù We decided to reach out to¬†Jeff Smith, senior managing director at BlackRock's Head of¬†Global Human Resources Group, to find out about the company's culture. Below is a transcript of the interview, edited slightly for clarity: BI: Can you describe the corporate culture at BlackRock? JS:¬†It's an¬†incredibly passionate place with a very clear sense of purpose and that goes from Larry Fink, our founder and CEO, to everyone else in the organization.¬† It's pretty special in that it doesn't feel like a place where people are just doing their jobs. Instead, we're heavily oriented toward constantly innovating. The people are heavily focused on the firm and it's not just about their individual accomplishments. It's not a place for egos.¬†We have company principles that we have built into everything we do. The senior leaders are committed to them and embed them into their everyday work. BI: How do you grow your leaders? JS:¬†It's a company that grew through acquisitions. People really had an opportunity to grow in different spaces. Around three¬†years ago, we really started to focus on formalizing development and¬†every person that manages someone else throughout the firm¬†got the opportunity to go¬†through management programs. We spend a lot of time making sure we're teaching one another. The most important things here are the people leadership, thought leadership and investment leadership.¬† BI: What do you think people value the most in a workplace?JS: People want to have challenging work that uses their skill sets.¬†People want to do well and have opportunities to grow professionally. Also, who¬†you work for and who you're led by is one of the most important things when it comes to employee satisfaction and performance. When we conduct our surveys,¬†90 percent of employees say they have confidence in the global¬†executive committee. We have really highly-engaged employees. The company certainly tries to engage you,¬†but I think it‚Äôs the leaders who really engage employees. BI: How often do you conduct your surveys?¬† JS:¬†We do it¬†every year. The surveys are designed to focus on two main things: Employee engagement and employee enablement, which means "Does the¬†work environment allow people to use their skills in their best way?" BI: How do you think BlackRock sets itself apart from other companies in the industry? JS: I think one of the things that's great about this company is that we're focused on our clients. We¬†don't spend a lot of time focusing on what other financial service companies are doing.¬† The public has a different perception on financial services in general than it did in the past. I think our values and integrity really stand out in a positive way and we are well-positioned and I think people¬†see that. BI: Do you have any perks that you offer your employees? JS:¬†Our objective is to serve our clients and pay people for performance. Our benefits are incredibly competitive and we focus on leadership and management development and training.¬† BI: How do you maintain employee engagement? JS: I think people think it's a company that challenges them and helps them learn. We bring our top 150 to 200 leaders together at regular meetings and rotate attendance so that people are connected. We do it globally, regionally and we do that a lot to bring people together. We also do a lot of volunteer work as a group. BlackRock has several employee networks that encourage connectivity and communication across business, such as VP Village, Employee Diversity networks like WIN ‚Äî the Women‚Äôs Initiative, OUT ‚Äî a community for¬†LGBT employees and their allies, a multi-culture network and veterans network.
On Friday, stocks closed at their highest levels since late 2007.¬† Meanwhile, earnings growth expectations continue to come down. "Since the end of the fourth quarter (December 31), analysts have also reduced earnings growth expectations for Q1 2013 (to 0.5% from 2.4%) and Q2 2013 (to 5.4% from 6.7%)," wrote FactSet's John Butters on Friday. Earnings are arguably the most important driver of stocks.¬† So, when stocks go up and earnings expectations come down, valuations are going up.¬† In other words, stocks are getting more expensive.¬† Technically speaking, multiples are expanding. This is something we've written about before expansion.¬† And for the bearish market watchers who have been pointing to falling earnings as a reason to get out of stocks, this ongoing multiples expansion is a true test of patience. Here's a chart from FactSet showing stocks (green) trending up, while earnings (blue) trend down: 
Bloomberg"Easier lending standards are usually associated with later employment growth," said UBS economist Ethan Harris at a luncheon in December. In fact, easing lending standards is one of the most compelling leading indicators of job creation. So, the results of the latest Federal Reserve Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey seems to be sending a bullish sign for jobs.¬† From today's Fed report: In the January survey, generally modest fractions of domestic banks reported having eased their standards across major loan categories over the past three months on net.¬†¬†¬† Domestic respondents indicated that demand for business loans, prime residential mortgages, and auto loans had strengthened, on balance, while demand for other types of loans was about unchanged. U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks, which mainly lend to businesses, reported little change in their lending standards, while demand for their loans was reportedly stronger on net.

One of Google's earliest directors, Ram Shriram, has added to his fortune by selling Google stock over the past monthó$31 million worth. He and his wife recently sold 42,000†shares, according to SEC documents. In January, the couple sold†the first chunk, 20,000 shares for $730 a pop ($14.6 million), and last week, he and his wife sold 22,000 shares in two transactions at $760 ($16.7 million). The sale on Friday came as Google's stock was reaching an all-time high of $776.60 (It closed at $775.60). The rise was attributed to news that Google was close to settling the European Union's three-year probe into its business. Google's previous high was $774.38, reached in October 2012. Not that Shriram could have timed the saleóas most top executives and insiders typically do, he's set up a 10b5-1 trading plan which dictates his selling according to preplanned conditions. Based on previous sales, it appears that Shriram sets round numbers as price levels at which he automatically sells shares. Shriram and his wife still own more than 150,000 shares. Plus, $31 million is pocket change for Ram, who has net worth of $1.6 billion, says Forbes. Shriram is one of the Valley's golden angels. In his early career he worked for Netscape. Then he founded a company called Junglee, which was bought by Amazon in 1998 for about $185 million. That gave him the capital to invest in Google when it was still operating out of a Menlo Park garage. Through his venture firm, Sherpalo Ventures, he's also an investor in StumbleUpon, Zazzle, and other startups. Don't miss: 7 Reasons Why You Should Buy Microsoftís New Version Of Office
Microsoft chairman Bill Gates was on Fareed Zakaria's show on CNN this weekend, and he had an interesting explanation for why businesses aren't spending more. In response to a question about fiscal policy, the debt, and sequestration he added GATES: Well, yes, sequestration is kind of this across the board thing that -- should you plan for that or not plan for that. Say you're a graduate student right now, is there going to be money for your lab, not money for your lab? Really awful to not make decisions. I'm not a macroeconomics person. You know clearly there's this global almost devaluation where everybody's trying to get their currencies to be worth less, which is quite unusual, which has business standing on the sidelines a bit in terms of their capital spending. And you'd like to unlock that. It's one of the big pools of money that's out there. We'd suggest that Gates has things backwards. Weak end demand is what's causing businesses to not invest as much as they otherwise might. Aggressive monetary policy is designed to make hoarding cash less appealing (and intuitively, if you're worried about "devaluation" then standing on the sidelines is the exact opposite of what you'd be inclined to do). Anyway, his point about the silliness of these across the board sequestration cuts is spot on. (Via Dan Drezner)
Critics of the US Federal Reserve are having a field day with embarrassing revelations of its risk assessments on the eve of the financial crisis. By law, the Fed is required to publish the transcripts of its Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings with a five-year lag. While the full-blown crisis did not erupt until the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, it was clear by the summer of 2007 that something was very wrong in credit markets, which were starting to behave in all sorts of strange ways. Yet many Fed officials clearly failed to recognize the significance of what was unfolding. One governor opined that the Fed should regard it as a good thing that markets were starting to worry about subprime mortgages. Another argued that the summertime market stress would most likely be a hiccup. Various critics are seizing on such statements as evidence that the Fed is incompetent, and that its independence should be curtailed, or worse. This is nonsense. Yes, things could and should have been done better; but to single out Fed governors for missing the coming catastrophe is ludicrous. The Fed was hardly alone. In August 2007, few market participants, even those with access to mountains of information and a broad range of expert opinions, had a real clue as to what was going on. Certainly the US Congress was clueless; its members were still busy lobbying for the government-backed housing-mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, thereby digging the hole deeper. Nor did the International Monetary Fund have a shining moment. In April 2007, the IMF released its famous ‚ÄúValentine‚Äôs Day‚Äù World Economic Outlook, in which it declared that all of the problems in the United States and other advanced economies that it had been worrying about were overblown. Moreover, it is misleading to single out the most misguided comments by individual governors in the context of an active intellectual debate over policy. It is legitimate to criticize individual policymakers who exercised poor judgment, and they should have a mark on their record. But that does not impugn the whole FOMC, much less the entire institution. Central banks‚Äô state-of-the-art macroeconomic models also failed miserably ‚Äì to a degree that the economics profession has only now begun to acknowledge fully. Although the Fed assesses many approaches and indicators in making its decisions, there is no doubt that it was heavily influenced by mainstream academic thinking ‚Äì including the so-called real business cycle models and New Keynesian models ‚Äì which assumed that financial markets operate flawlessly. Indeed, the economics profession and the world‚Äôs major central banks advertised the idea of the ‚Äúgreat moderation‚Äù ‚Äì the muting of macroeconomic volatility, owing partly to monetary authorities‚Äô supposedly more scientific, model-based approach to policymaking. We now know that canonical macroeconomic models do not adequately allow for financial-market fragilities, and that fixing the models while retaining their tractability is a formidable task. Frankly, had the models at least allowed for the possibility of credit-market imperfections, the Fed might have paid more attention to credit-market indicators as a reflection of overall financial-market conditions, as central banks in emerging-market countries do. Last but not least, even if the Fed had better understood the risks, it would not have been easy for it to avert the crisis on its own. The effectiveness of interest-rate policy is limited, and many of the deepest problems were on the regulatory side. And calibrating a response was not easy. By late 2007, for example, the Fed and the US Treasury had most likely already seen at least one report arguing that only massive intervention to support subprime loans could forestall a catastrophe. The idea was to save the financial system from having to deal with safely dismantling the impossibly complex contractual edifices ‚Äì which did not allow for the possibility of systemic collapse ‚Äì that it had constructed. Such a bailout would have cost an estimated $500 billion or more, and the main beneficiaries would have included big financial firms. Was there any realistic chance that such a measure would have passed Congress before there was blood in the streets? Indeed, it was precisely this logic that me led to give a very dark forecast in a widely covered speech in Singapore on August 19, 2008, a month before Lehman Brothers failed. I argued that things would not get better until they got much worse, and that the collapse of one of the world‚Äôs largest financial firms was imminent. My argument rested on my view that the global economy was entering a major recession, and I had the benefit of my quantitative work, with Carmen Reinhart, on the history of financial crises. I was not trying to be sensational in Singapore. I thought that what I was saying was completely obvious. Nevertheless, my prediction gained bold front-page headlines in many major newspapers throughout the world. It gained headlines, evidently, because it was still far from a consensus view, although concerns were mounting. Were concerns mounting at the Fed as well in the summer of 2008? We will have to wait until next year to find out. But, when we do, let us remember that hindsight is 20-20.

BloombergThe $140 DB Burger "Royale" Big thanks to Bloomberg TV, which invited me in for their "Burger Smackdown" event, where Stephanie Ruhle, Erik Schatzker, Tom Keene, Max Abelson, and I sampled some high-end burgers fit for Wall Streeters with deep pockets. The whole video is below, but tied for the best was the $140 DB Burger "Royale" from the DB Bistro Moderne. First, here's the info we got on it. Below we'll note our impressions: DB BURGER ‚ÄúROYALE‚Äù, DB BISTRO MODERNE: ‚Ä¢ We will have the ‚ÄúRoyale‚Äù on set ‚Ä¢ Royale cots between $70-$140 MC (according to their site) ‚Ä¢ Original DB Burger costs $32 MC ‚Ä¢ Royale Description: Sirloin Burger Filled with Braised Short Ribs Foie Gras and Black Truffle, Served on a Parmesan Bun Pommes Fritesor Pommes Souffl√©es With Layered Shaved Black Truffles¬† The db Burger was created by Chef Daniel Boulud prior to db Bistro Moderne‚Äôs June 2001 opening. The impetus came from a journalist asking Daniel to comment on the rioting of French farmers directed at McDonald‚Äôs locations in France.* ‚ÄúThe French are just jealous they did not invent the hamburger themselves‚Äù Daniel responded. Inspired by the topic, the chef went on to invent a burger of his own, combining the best of French and American cuisine. The result is the now famous db burger. Its delectable stuffing is based on the short ribs braised in red wine that are a signature dish on the menu at DANIEL. The renowned burger is offered exclusively at db Bistro Moderne, at the restaurant‚Äôs locations in in New York City, Miami and Singapore.¬† The db burger is actually a combination of two dishes: on the outside a classic ground sirloin burger, and on the inside a stuffing of tender red wine braised short ribs (off the bone), foie gras, a mirepoix of root vegetables and preserved black truffle. The homemade toasted parmesan and poppy seed bun is spread with a touch of fresh horseradish, oven roasted tomato confit, fresh tomato, red onions and fris√©e lettuce.¬† The db Burger ‚ÄúRoyale‚Äù features the addition of fresh black truffle and a truffle dressing. The ‚ÄúRoyale‚Äù version was launched in January 2003, with the arrival of black truffle season. Black truffle has always been a key ingredient in the burger‚Äôs rich stuffing, making the dish a perfect vehicle for slices of this decadent, intensely flavored extravagance. You can choose to have several ethereal slices of fresh black truffle cover the DB Burger ‚ÄúRoyale‚Äù, but only during the black truffle season. With fresh black Perigord truffles commanding as much as $800 or more per pound, a burger laden with them is a luxury. The ‚ÄúRoyale version of the burger is market priced, according to the seasonal market price of fresh black truffle. It is served exclusively during black truffle season, which usually runs from late December through late March. So how was it? Actually awesome. Between the fois gras and the truffles it's like biting into a luscious burger cake. The only weird part about it is that it's very high, so biting into it is a challenge (mercifully, the actual eating was off camera). Is it worth $140? Sure, why not. I just ate a third of one, and it was basically a complete meal. A full one would be more than a huge feast with the finest, fattiest, juiciest ingredients. Probably worth doing once.
Stock investors were undoubtedly happy to see on Thursday of last week that the core personal consumption expenditures deflator rose only 1.3% y/y during December, the lowest since May 2011. It‚Äôs also well below the Fed‚Äôs 2.5% red line. In Friday‚Äôs employment report, wages of all workers rose 2.1% y/y during January. That‚Äôs still very subdued, though up from last year‚Äôs low of 1.5% during October. On the other hand, the expected inflation rate embedded in the spread between 10-year Treasuries and TIPS was at 2.6% on Friday, and seems set to move higher. If it does so, that could put the Fed in a real box. If expected inflation spikes up later this year, there could be more than one or two dissenters in the FOMC. Esther L. George, the President of the Kansas City FRB, was the lone dissenter with a vote at the January 29-30 meeting of the FOMC because she ‚Äúwas concerned that the continued high level of monetary accommodation increased the risks of future economic and financial imbalances and, over time, could cause an increase in long-term inflation expectations.‚Äù Dr. Ed's Blog Today's Morning Briefing: Goldilocks Is Back.

China just reported its first capital account deficit since 1998. But Standard Chartered's Stephen Green and Wei Li write that there is no reason to worry about hot money flowing out of the country (money that moves from one country to another to benefit from interest rate differences or a change in exchange rate).†  First, capital account outflows are actually slowing, and have gone from $52 billion in the third quarter, to $14 billion in the fourth. This suggests that capital outflows have slowed going into 2013. Standard Chartered † With regards to capital outflows there are a few key things to keep in mind. So, it's too early to worry about a run on China. SEE ALSO: GMO - China Is Marching Toward A Credit Crisis &gt;
Julia La Roche for Business InsiderThrough a FOIA request,¬†New York Post's Michelle Celarier has obtained 192 complaints about Herbalife filed with the Federal Trade Commission over the last seven years.¬† According to the Post's report, the FTC is probing the multi-level marketing company that sells nutrition products. Click to see the complaints &gt; Herbalife has been one of the most controversial stocks lately. ¬†¬† Bill Ackman, the founder of Pershing Square, has publicly said he's shorting more than 20 million shares of the MLM. ¬†Ackman gave a presentation in December saying that he believes the company is a "pyramid scheme" and has a price target of zero.¬† Herbalife¬†responded Ackman's thesis¬†calling it a "malicious attack" and accused him of using "outdated" and "inaccurate information." After Ackman publicly declared his short, hedge fund heavyweight Daniel Loeb, the founder of Third Point LLC, took out a 8.24% stake in the company on the long side. ¬†Some other fund managers have also gone long Herbalife after disagreeing with Ackman's short case. Right now, it looks like Ackman is winning the hedge fund war. Herbalife's stock is getting hammered today on the FTC news. ¬†The stock was last trading down more than 5.9%, well below the pre-Ackman short levels.¬† We combed through the 729 pages of complaints available on the FTC's website, which have been largely redacted, and have included some of them in the slides that follow.¬† That being said, a lot of the customer complaints were requesting a refund of the $9.95 they paid for an introductory DVD into the company, while others complained about receiving spam emails and unwanted telephone calls.
Bloomberg TVJamie Dimon is speaking at the South Florida Economic Summit right now and Bloomberg TV is airing his talk. The JP Morgan CEO hasn't said anything super surprising ‚Äîhe got to the "widest, deepest, most liquid capital markets" quote and also reiterated his bank's commitment to Europe ‚Äî but he did say something in passing that piqued Business Insider's interest. It was about a "secret money room" JP Morgan. Here's what he said: "We have a great room, I forget the name of it, it's a money room, at an undisclosed location. It's in Florida, but it moves, every day, $2-5 trillion around the world. JP Morgan moves a lot of money for corporations and individuals and that room which I took my Board of Directors to, is just very impressive." Much of the speech is about what banks do to help companies and individuals, and so his point is that JPMorgan provides a lot of money to a lot of folks every day. He argued out that big banks are the only ones that have the power to bank countries around the world. "I agree with people who say banks shouldn't be too big to fail," he said. "It should be bankruptcy and the damn bank board should be fired..tax payers should never have to pay and you should believe it. I want to call it bankruptcy for big dumb banks... There should be some form of Old Testament justice including clawbacks of comp." Dimon also reiterated his concern for the state of education in the United States (especially among minorities and the poor), energy, and immigration. All that said: If Dimon wants to give another tour of the money room, Business Insider would be happy to join. Thanks.
Did you see what Italy did today? It got crushed to the tune of 4.5%.  What's the big concern? Basically, there's an Italian vote coming up, and it seems like Berlusconi's party just keeps creeping a little bit higher, raising the odds of a chaotic outcome. This weekend Berlusconi upped the ante, basically offering taxpayers free money if they vote for him, an offer which infuriated the current PM Mario Monti. From Bloomberg: Silvio Berlusconi‚Äôs campaign promise to give Italian taxpayers a cash rebate of 4 billion euros ($5.4 billion) was criticized by Prime Minister Mario Monti as an attempt to buy votes.¬† ‚ÄúWe can call it a quid pro quo or even a friendly attempt at corruption,‚Äù Monti said today in an interview with RTL 102.5 radio. ‚ÄúBerlusconi wants to buy the votes of Italians with the money that Italians had to turn over to cover up the shortfall left in the public accounts by Berlusconi, who governed for eight of the past 10 years.‚Äù Already, a site has set up the Berlusconi offer generator.

First it was billionaire hedge fund manager George Soros saying hedge fund managers were over charging for their services, now it's Cliff Asness. Here what Asness, who founded quant fund AQR Capital told Financial News: ‚ÄúHedge funds generally offer a nice portfolio (gross of fees!) of passive beta, alpha, and a middle ground we call hedge fund beta or style premia. But, unfortunately, managers like to charge fees as if it‚Äôs all alpha.‚ÄùHe said: ‚ÄúMost hedge fund strategies are more about very competent implementation and fair fees and terms, than they are about ‚Äògenius‚Äô.‚Äù All this uproar is about the infamous "2 and 20" hedge fund payment scheme (2 and 20 = 2% of AUM charged for management fees, 20% returns above a certain benchmark go to the fund). Soros said that it's eating into hedge fund profits and is part of the reason they can't beat the market. Maybe this means Asness and Soros can be each other's only hedge fund manager friends.

January was a historic month for flows into equity mutual funds ñ at $56.8 billion ñ and many are still trying to make sense of what exactly happened. Many have argued that this was reflective of a "Great Rotation" of funds from bonds to stocks. The problem with that narrative, though, was that bond funds didn't experience outflows in January. Investors were still pouring money into those, too. The latest weekly H.8 data†on bank balance sheets†put out by the Federal Reserve offers a clue as to where all of this money is coming from. The chart below shows deposits at commercial banks in the United States.†Banks recorded big deposit inflows in November and December, and in January, those flows reversed and the overall level of deposits shrank at a similar pace: Bloomberg, Business Insider When asked about the "Great Rotation" in an interview with Bloomberg TV on Friday, PIMCO CEO Mohamed El-Erian suggested that the expiration of unlimited FDIC insurance on bank accounts with deposit balances over $250,000 could be driving the flows into equities. He said, "What I think we are all seeing ñ the equity funds, the fixed income funds, the commodity funds ñ is a rotation out of money market funds and out of bank accounts that no longer have complete FDIC insurance." That theory would make sense, given the big deposit outflows ($255 billion) we've seen from U.S. banks in January. However, it doesn't sufficiently address the rapid expansion in deposits ($316 billion) observed in November and December. Furthermore, equity funds don't exactly make a great substitute for the safety of a savings account, FDIC-insured or not. What Really Happened The more likely explanation for the deposit outflows, and in turn, a significant portion of the record flows into equities in January, is the mad rush of special dividends paid out by big companies to shareholders ahead of the fiscal cliff at the end of last year. Some thinkers like John Carney brought up this explanation in recent days. Bush-era tax cuts that brought the tax rate on dividends down to 15 percent were set to expire, and dividends would, starting in 2013, be taxed as ordinary income ñ which meant for wealthy investors, the rate would nearly triple.†However, the final compromise on the dividend tax at the beginning of January was much better than investors had feared. Nevertheless, those special dividends were already paid out. Citi analyst Andrew Hollenhorst attributes the surge in deposits in November and December to the special dividends. According to the BEA, those special dividends also account for the†unexpected surge in personal income growth†in December. The charts below show the spike in dividend payments and the corresponding deposit inflows (click to enlarge): Citi Research, BEA, SAAR, Fed H.8 Hollenhorst says the expiration of the FDIC insurance cited by El-Erian (known as Transaction Account Guarantee, or TAG) is likely a red herring. In a note to clients, he writes (emphasis added): Collateral levels, while no longer at their highs, are still at levels that were consistent with Treasury repo of about 19bp in 2012. Many pointed to money market fund (MMF) inflows as a sure sign of TAG deposits shifting. However, the flows were not focused on institutional government funds, where we would have expected them, and we have begun to see money fund assets decline. As discussed below, we are also unconvinced that bank deposit flows are indicative of TAG reallocation. Rather than TAG or Operation Twist, we think that the surge in cash entering short-term markets may be partially accounted for by a one time $35.5 billion increase in personal dividend income in Q4 2012. With the fiscal cliff fast approaching, corporations sought to pay special dividends ahead of potential tax rises. It makes sense that investors, both individuals and institutions, would have in the short term moved some of this windfall into bank deposits and MMFs while waiting to reinvest. This is consistent with the uptick in late 2012 and downtick in early 2013 in MMF and bank deposits. Interestingly large bank deposits rose about 1% more from Oct.-Dec. in 2012 relative to 2011 and then dropped by a similar amount more in the first three weeks in January. In other words, there is a compelling argument to be made that the big flows into equity funds in January were driven by the one-off special dividend payments made in late 2012. If that is the case, the key evidence of a "Great Rotation" into equities at this stage has disappeared. MORE: There's No More Pizza For Breakfast In The Bond Market &gt;

">Vanity FairOver at Dealbook Peter Lattman and Andrew Ross Sorkin report that new evidence has come to light that could help the defendant of the most profitable insider trading case in history, Mathew Martoma. Last fall Martoma, a former portfolio manager at a subsidiary of Steve Cohen's hedge fund SAC Capital, was accused of using an expert to get inside information on two pharmaceutical companies, Elan and Wyeth. According to authorities, Martoma then advised SAC to trade on that information, and Steve Cohen (mentioned in the complaint as 'Portfolio Manager A') knew it. The problem with those allegations now, says Dealbook, is that SAC may not have had the exposure to those pharmaceutical companies that authorities allege it did. From Dealbook (emphasis ours): Internal SAC trading records, according to people directly involved in the case, indicate that the hedge fund did not have a negative bet in place in advance of the announcement of the drug trial‚Äôs disappointing results. Instead, the records indicated that SAC, through a series of trades, including a complex transaction known as an equity swap, had virtually no exposure ‚Äî neither long nor short ‚Äî heading into the disclosure of the drug data. A different narrative surrounding the firm‚Äôs trading could help Mr. Martoma, who has pleaded not guilty to securities fraud and conspiracy in what the government calls the most lucrative insider trading case ever charged... Still, perhaps more important, the trading records may complicate a government effort to pursue a case against Mr. Cohen. The SAC founder has not been accused of any wrongdoing, and has said he acted appropriately at all times. A few more things that are making this case complicated ‚Äî Martoma has yet to cooperate with the government, the statute of limitations on this case is closing in (this all happened back in 2008), and it simply isn't that weird for a hedge fund of SAC's size and sophistication to get in and out of big positions quickly.
Stocks are selling off today.† The Dow is off by more than 100 points. However, the Dow is also less than 300 points from its all-time high.† So, some pundits might characterize today's sell-off as "profit-taking." Time will tell if we've seen the top of the market. But if stocks continue to sell, then there's no doubt that some people will point to this week's Barron's cover as the sign of the top. You see, a bullish cover story is often interpreted as an indication that bullishness has hit a high.† And when it's hit a high, then it can only go down from there.

So it shouldn't surprise anyone that he has something to say about Greg Smith's tell-all, 'Why I Left Goldman Sachs', and he says it all for The New Republic. All in all Lewis' rundown of the book shreds Smith, Goldman and Wall Street in general. Smith's account is sanctimonious and self-centered, doing little to answer the most important questions justifiably skeptical readers have about his motives for writing the book and why Goldman became corrupt during his time there. Sure, Smith gets to the fact that bonus incentives changed in 2005 ‚Äî Goldmanites started getting paid based on how much they were bringing into the firm, not on a general pay scale based on their position ‚Äî but it's something that's mentioned "almost in passing" (according to Lewis) near the end of the book. From TNR: In the end, the reader puts down Why I Left Goldman Sachs a little mystified. Why exactly did Greg Smith leave Goldman Sachs? What did he hope to achieve? If it's change he is after, his particular story comes too late. If, say, back in 2004, someone such as Greg Smith had stepped forward and explained to the world what was going on inside Goldman, he might have spared us all a lot of pain and trouble. But today's insider confessions feel like vain and useless acts. And what would he have us do, four years after the Great Collapse, to fix the system, or to change in any way his former employer's behavior? The dystopia often imagined in the world of artificial intelligence‚Äîin which computers somehow take on a life of their own and come to rule mankind‚Äîhas actually happened in the world of finance. The giant Wall Street firms have taken on lives of their own, beyond human control. The people flow into and out of them but have only incidental effect on their direction and behavior. The firms may not be intent on evil; they aren't intent on anything except short-term profits: they're insensible. If anyone attempted to seize control of one of these strange machines and impose upon them a clear moral direction, the machine would hit its own button and he would be ejected. And that's what happened to Smith, Lewis argues. He was ejected. He was ripe for ejection anyway. Goldman might as well have said 'good riddance'. One disgruntled employee won't change Goldman, Goldman has to be changed from the outside. The market could do it, he continues, but the government is standing in the way. From TNR: ...the financial sector is already so gummed up by government subsidies that market forces no longer operate within it. Could Goldman Sachs fail, even if it tried? If someone invented a cheaper way to finance productive enterprise, would they stand a chance against the big guys? Along with the other too-big-to-fail firms, Goldman needs to be busted up into smaller pieces. The ultimate goal should be to create institutions so dull and easy to understand that, when a young man who works for one of them walks into a publisher's office and offers to write up his experiences, the publisher looks at him blankly and asks, "Why would anyone want to read that?"

Today's Links:THE ESSENTIAL EIGHT Interview With Hillary Clinton - NYTimes.com- on chen guangcheng negotiations// [On Thursday], I had a lunch that include the main negotiators for the Chinese side and then I went to a large event on our people-to-people relationships. There were two incredible, attractive young people, one Chinese and one American, and they stood up and spoke about how important this relationship was and how valuable their experiences had been. Most of the main players on the Chinese side were there. It was a moment when I looked at all of them, and I know they‚Äôre thinking: ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want this all to break up over this guy. What are we going to do?‚Äù I could just see it. The next morning we had a pre-existing event with American and Chinese business people, and we were back in one of the big beautiful all-glass pavilions. And I sent a note to Dai [China foreign policy official Dai Bingguo] saying, ‚ÄúYou and I have got to talk.‚Äù I made what I knew would be the kind of final argument about why, but we couldn‚Äôt risk seeing our relationship founder over this. We would never agree on what happened and why, but we had to resolve it. So then Dai gave the go-ahead for his side to negotiate with ours again and we got an agreement. It was incredibly intense, but I was always confident. Politics of pollution: China's oil giants take a choke-hold on power | Reuters- With widespread and rising public anger changing the political calculus, it also poses a broader question of whether the incoming administration led by Communist Party chief Xi Jinping will stand up to powerful vested interests in a country where state-owned enterprises have long trumped certain ministries in the quest for economic growth at all costs. "I think the Communist Party's new government should weaken CNPC and Sinopec," said Wang Yukai, a professor from the National School of Administration. "These interest groups have too much power." Delays in implementing stricter emission standards are rooted in money -- chiefly, who should pay for the price of refining cleaner fuels? By some estimates, auto emissions contribute as much as a quarter of the most dangerous particles in Beijing's air. State-owned oil companies in firing line over Beijing's pollution | South China Morning Post- Bureaucratic fighting between the environment ministry on the one hand and China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) and Sinopec Group on the other has thwarted stricter emission standards for diesel trucks and buses - a main cause of air pollution blanketing dozens of cities. To be sure, many sources contribute to air pollution levels that hit records last month, but analysts say the oil companies' foot-dragging and disregard of environmental regulations underscore a critical challenge facing a toothless ministry in its mission to curb air pollution. ‰∏ìÂÆ∂Áß∞‰∏≠ÂõΩÊà∑Á±çÁÆ°ÁêÜÊºèÊ¥ûÁôæÂá∫ËÉåÂêéÊòØÁ§æ‰ºö‰∏çÂÖ¨_ÁΩëÊòìÊñ∞Èóª‰∏≠ÂøÉ- China Youth Daily on the multiple hukou scandals exposing the loopholes and injustice in the hukou system..perhaps these scandals will be a fillip to real hukou reform...// ËøôÂêçÊã•Êúâ‰∏§Â≤∏‰∏âÊà∑Á±çÁöÑÂ•≥ÂïÜ‰∫∫ËøÖÈÄüÂºïËµ∑ËàÜËÆ∫ÂÖ≥Ê≥®„ÄÇ‰∏çËøáÔºåÂ•πÂπ∂ÈùûÁ¨¨‰∏Ä‰∏™Ëµ∞ËøõÂÖ¨‰ºóËßÜÁ∫øÁöÑ‚ÄúÊà∑Âè£Âßê‚Äù„ÄÇÂú®Ëøô‰πãÂâçÔºå‚ÄúÊàøÂ¶π‚Äù„ÄÅ‚ÄúÊàøÂßê‚ÄùÁ≠â‰∏ÄÁ≥ªÂàóÊåÅÊúâÂ§öÊà∑Âè£„ÄÅÂ§öË∫´‰ªΩÁöÑ‚ÄúÊàø√ó‚ÄùÂ∑≤ÈôÜÁª≠ÈÅ≠Âà∞Ë≠¶ÊñπË∞ÉÊü•„ÄÇÂÖ∂‰∏≠ÔºåÈôïË•øÁúÅÁ•ûÊú®ÂéøÂÜúÊùëÂïÜ‰∏öÈì∂Ë°åÂéüÂâØË°åÈïøÈæöÁà±Áà±Ë¢´ÂèëÁé∞Êã•Êúâ4‰∏™Êà∑Âè£Ôºå41Â•óÂú®‰∫¨Êàø‰∫ßÔºåÈù¢ÁßØËøë‰∏áÂπ≥ÊñπÁ±≥„ÄÇ 1Êúà31Êó•ÔºåÈæöÁà±Áà±‰∫ã‰ª∂ÁöÑ7ÂêçÊ∂âÊ°à‰∫∫ÂëòË¢´Âàë‰∫ãÊãòÁïôÔºåÂÖ∂‰∏≠4‰∫∫‰∏∫ÂÖ¨ÂÆâÊ∞ëË≠¶„ÄÇÈöèÂêéÔºå‰∏éÈæöÁà±Áà±ÂÖ±ÂêåÊã•ÊúâÊüêÂ§ÑÊàø‰∫ßÁöÑÈ´òÂºïÂ®•‰πüË¢´ÂèëÁé∞Êã•ÊúâÂ§ö‰∏™Êà∑Á±ç„ÄÇ Êà∑Á±ç‰π±Ë±°ÂºïÂèëËøΩÈóÆÔºåËøôÈáåÈù¢ÁÆ°ÁêÜÊºèÊ¥ûÁ©∂Á´üÊúâÂ§öÂ∞ëÔºü China services' slow uptick highlights mildness of recovery | Reuters- The services industry has so far weathered the global slowdown much better than the factory sector, with the PMI consistently signalling healthy expansion and hitting a 10-month high of 58.0 in March.That is partly due to a maturing economy as well as a historic shift in the last decade leading a majority of Chinese to live and work in cities rather than the countryside.

Kerry must engage China - Harvard - Belfer Center - Nicholas Burns - hasn't the US been engaging China for 30 years? who is advocating we stop? // My Harvard colleague, Joseph Nye, suggested wisely in a recent New York Times op-ed that we not seek to contain China but continue the more nuanced Clinton-Bush policy of "integrate but hedge" instead. The hedge is clear -- Obama's smart and welcome drive to reinforce our alliances with the democratic countries of Asia. But he and Kerry now need to try to "integrate" China more deeply into the global trade and commercial system and find a way to make it a more reliable partner on critical issues such as climate change and North Korea. How might the United States better engage China in 2013? First, Obama and Kerry should commit to more frequent meetings with the new Chinese leadership. American leaders still spend far more time with their European and Middle Eastern counterparts than they do with Chinese leaders. Engaging China is not a panacea but is the only way to begin building greater confidence and trust. Personal ties often matter in international politics. Thus, early meetings withXi Jinping are imperative. ‰∫∫Ê∞ëÊó•Êä•-Êñ∞ÂûãÂ§ßÂõΩÂÖ≥Á≥ª ‰∏çÊòØÁ©∫Ê¥ûÊ¶ÇÂøµ Èíü Â£∞ - Zhong Sheng on new type of great power relations between US and China...not much detail, but does warn that blocking China's protection of its sovereign territorial rights and unification will seriously hurt the feelings of 1.3 Billion people// ‰∏≠ÁæéÂêà‰ΩúË¶ÅÈ°∫Âà©Êé®ËøõÔºåË¶Å‰ª•Áõ∏‰∫í‰ø°‰ªª‰∏∫Âü∫Á°ÄÔºåÂ∞äÈáçÂΩºÊ≠§ÁöÑÊ†∏ÂøÉÂà©Áõä„ÄÇ‰∏≠ÂõΩÊúâÊùÉÂíåÁæéÂõΩ‰∫´ÊúâÂêåÁ≠âÁöÑÂ∞äÈáç„ÄÇ‰ºÅÂõæÈòªÁ¢ç‰∏≠ÂõΩÁª¥Êä§È¢ÜÂúü‰∏ªÊùÉÂÆåÊï¥ÂíåÂÆûÁé∞ÂõΩÂÆ∂Áªü‰∏ÄÁöÑÂä™ÂäõÔºåÂäøÂøÖ‰ºö‰∏•Èáç‰º§ÂÆ≥ÂçÅ‰∏â‰∫ø‰∏≠ÂõΩ‰∫∫Ê∞ëÁöÑÊÑüÊÉÖ„ÄÇ‰∏≠Áæé‰∏ç‰ªÖË¶Å‰ª•Âª∫ËÆæÊÄßÂßøÊÄÅÁÆ°ÊéßÂ•ΩÁüõÁõæÂàÜÊ≠ßÔºåÂêåÊó∂‰πüË¶Å‰∏∫Â≠òÂú®ÁöÑÈóÆÈ¢òÊé¢Á¥¢Ëß£ÂÜ≥ÂäûÊ≥ï„ÄÇÂè™Êúâ‰ª•ÂíåÂπ≥Âêà‰ΩúÁöÑÊÄùÁª¥Âèñ‰ª£ÂÜ∑ÊàòÊÄùÁª¥Ôºå‰ª•Êé•Ëß¶ÂØπËØùÂèñ‰ª£ÂØπÊäóÈÅèÂà∂Ôºå‰∏≠ÁæéÂÖ≥Á≥ªÊâçËÉΩÂÅ•Â∫∑ÂèëÂ±ï„ÄÇÂΩìÂâçÔºå‰∏§ÂõΩÂ∫îÊäì‰ΩèÊú∫ÈÅáÔºåÂºÄËØöÂ∏ÉÂÖ¨Âú∞ËøõË°åÂØπËØùÔºå‰ª•ÂÆûÈôÖË°åÂä®‰∏∫‰∏≠ÁæéÂÖ≥Á≥ªÊ≥®ÂÖ•Ê≠£ËÉΩÈáèÔºåÂÖ±ÂêåÊûÑÂª∫Áõ∏‰∫íÂ∞äÈáç„ÄÅÂêà‰ΩúÂÖ±Ëµ¢ÁöÑÊñ∞ÂûãÂ§ßÂõΩÂÖ≥Á≥ª„ÄÇ ¬† BUSINESS AND ECONOMY Ahead of the Tape: Yum's Chinese Yuck Factor - WSJ.com - the problems may run deeper than a 45 day bird// You won't find "45-day chicken" in any cookbook, but it has become a potential recipe for disaster at Yum Brands Inc.

In an interview before the Super Bowl, President Obama took a jab at hedge funds and private equity firms across the country, saying that he would finally take on "carried interest" tax, Reuters reports. There were whispers about the Obama administration tackling carried interest after the election, but it wasn't until last night that we heard anything specific from the President. Wall Street loves the rule because it allows hedge funds and private equity firms to pay tax on a substantial chunk of their income at a discounted rate ó 20%. The Tax Policy Center gets more specific: Carried interest is a right that entitles the general partner (GP) of a private investment fund to a share of the fundís profits (see figure 1). Typically, the GP contributes 1 to 5 percent of the fundís initial capital and commits to managing the fundís assets. In exchange, the GP receives an annual management fee of 2 percent of the fundís assets plus a "carried interest" of 20 percent of the fundís profits that exceed a certain "hurdle" rate of return. The individual partners of the GP, not the GP itself, are taxed on these payments. Last night, Obama said that he wasn't looking to raise tax rates, but we the country does need more revenue and carried interest is an easy target since so few people deal with it. From Reuters: There is no doubt we need additional revenue, coupled with smart spending reductions in order to bring down our deficit. And we can do it in a gradual way so that it doesn't have a huge impact," he said. Obama indicated he would seek to end deductions that are not available to all Americans, singling out "carried interest," which refers to the tax rate paid by many private equity managers, venture capital and real estate partnerships. And despite the fact that hedge fund managers (like David Tepper and Bill Ackman) have said that they could deal with a higher rate, despite the fact that private equity CEO's like Carlyle Group's David Rubenstein have been saying that this issue was going to come up for months, there has already been some push back from industry lobbies. Reuters: "Given the 58 percent increase in taxes paid on capital gains as part of the recent deal to avert the fiscal cliff, it is our hope that any tax reform effort in 2013 will be about crafting policies that incentivize economic growth," said Steve Judge, president and chief executive of Private Equity Growth Capital Council, responding to Obama's comments. Ronald Reagan raised capital gains rates to 28% back in 1986, so expect to hear a lot of references to that during this fight. Another thing proponents of reform have on their side is that there's already a bill called the Carried Interest Fairness Act sponsored by Congressman Sander Levin (D-MI) but it's been stuck in the Ways and Means Committee since last February. 
With increasing frequency I see articles on how robots are taking jobs once held by humans. Typically I batch a few of them up for comments, and I have a new set now.

And only when the burgerís finished cooking does Alpha slice the tomatoes and pickles and place them on the burger as fresh as can be. Finally, the machine wraps the burger up for serving. Alpha churns out a painless 360 hamburgers per hour. Saving money with Alpha is pretty easy to imagine. You donít even need cashiers or servers. Customers could just punch in their order, pay, and wait at a dispensing window. For their next model Momentum Machines plans on adding a custom meat grinding feature so it can mix different meats ñ 1/3 pork, 2/3 bison sounds like a tasty combo ñ in the same burger. Theyíll also give it gourmet cooking abilities that seasoned chefs use such as charring the burger while retaining its juiciness. The company plans on launching the first ever restaurant chain with a cook staff made entirely of robots. But not only might we soon find Alphaís creations at local burger joints, but the company is also targeting convenience stores, food trucks, and somehow even vending machines. Robot Wars in China China Daily reports Chinese robot wars set to erupt Recent research conducted by the consultancy Ernst &amp; Young LLP suggests that the average annual labor cost per worker rose to more than 40,000 yuan ($6,400) in 2011, from less than 25,000 yuan five years ago. Given the context, it's easy to calculate the tradeoffs of getting a robot. "In fact, industrial robots are already cheaper than workers in China's eastern regions," said Wang Tianmiao, who heads the expert panel of robot technology under the State High-Tech Development Plan. Wang said a typical industrial robot costs around 300,000 yuan and has annual maintenance costs of 20,000 yuan. The total layout of 500,000 yuan over 10 years is considerably less than that for a 6,000-yuan-a-month technician, and robots can work three times more efficiently. Technology Kills Middle-Class Jobs Yahoo! News reports Recession, tech kill middle-class jobs. Five years after the start of the Great Recession, the toll is terrifyingly clear: Millions of middle-class jobs have been lost in developed countries the world over. And the situation is even worse than it appears. Most of the jobs will never return, and millions more are likely to vanish as well, say experts who study the labor market. What's more, these jobs aren't just being lost to China and other developing countries, and they aren't just factory work. Increasingly, jobs are disappearing in the service sector, home to two-thirds of all workers. They're being obliterated by technology. Year after year, the software that runs computers and an array of other machines and devices becomes more sophisticated and powerful and capable of doing more efficiently tasks that humans have always done. For decades, science fiction warned of a future when we would be architects of our own obsolescence, replaced by our machines; an Associated Press analysis finds that the future has arrived. "There's no sector of the economy that's going to get a pass," says Martin Ford, who runs a software company and wrote "The Lights in the Tunnel," a book predicting widespread job losses. "It's everywhere." The numbers startle even labor economists. In the United States, half the 7.5 million jobs lost during the Great Recession were in industries that pay middle-class wages, ranging from $38,000 to $68,000. But only 2 percent of the 3.5 million jobs gained since the recession ended in June 2009 are in midpay industries. Nearly 70 percent are in low-pay industries, 29 percent in industries that pay well. Experts warn that this "hollowing out" of the middle-class workforce is far from over. They predict the loss of millions more jobs as technology becomes even more sophisticated and reaches deeper into our lives. The most vulnerable workers are doing repetitive tasks that programmers can write software for ó an accountant checking a list of numbers, an office manager filing forms, a paralegal reviewing documents for key words to help in a case. As software becomes even more sophisticated, victims are expected to include those who juggle tasks, such as supervisors and managers ó workers who thought they were protected by a college degree. Seemingly, there is no end to this. Software robots handle voice activated queries and mechanical robots replace humans in manufacturing. If a job is repetitive and programmable, a robot is out to get it. That even includes minimum wage jobs in manufacturing and in food service.†

Raymond James strategist Jeff Saut offers his take on where the market is headed next. Today is session 23 in the typical 17- to 25-session duration of a "buying stampede." Such skeins only have one- to three-session pauses or pullbacks before they exhaust themselves on the upside. While a few have lasted for 25 - 30 sessions, it is very rare to have one last for more than 30 sessions. That said, this one feels like it will extend towards the State of the Union address slated for February 12th. That address will likely be viewed negatively by the equity markets, which should serve to finally bring about a 5 - 7% correction. How the stock market reacts following such a pullback will tell us a lot about the market's future direction. In the interim I favor the upside with the caveat that this rally is long of tooth. We have no idea if Saut is right or wrong or not, but do find it interesting that Obama's comments are still viewed so suspiciously by market pros. The market has gone on a huge tear during this administration, and yet there's always this fear that Obama will say something about taxes that will cause investors to panic.
Turning into a bit of an ugly day. US futures are pointing to an open right now around 0.5%. The real story today is in Italy, where concerns about the outcome of the coming election seem to be worried. FTSE MIB
WikipediWall Street has often been referred to as a casino, but one bank actually owns a Las Vegas casino. Deutsche Bank's portfolio includes the $3.9 billion Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, which the bank finished building after the developer defaulted on their loans. During Super Bowl weekend, everyone from Wall Street to Main Street flocked to Sin City to engage in the sports betting scene and celebrate the biggest football game of the year. And this gorgeous casino Deutsche bank owns looks like an awesome place to do just that. (Corey Deshon shared his photos with us.)
With the various market indices pressing near all-time highs, this might seem obvious, but this is a key point from Goldman Sachs Asset Management chairman Jim O'Neill regarding market valuations. This is from his latest Viewpoints letter. ...I would also like to mention, is according to one of the more cautious valuation techniques I have learnt to follow, so called CAPE (Cyclically Adjusted Price Earnings), the US market is certainly not cheap today, and neither are Australia nor Mexico (see table below). Such a cautious approach does not mean these or any markets will stop rallying but it is a sign to be careful and that these markets could be especially vulnerable to disappointing and surprising news. Many other markets do remain quite cheap, including the other seven of our so-called Growth Markets, as well as Japan and much of continental Europe. This explains why, as I have been suggesting, I would still concentrate my bullishness there. Goldman Sachs

According to Bloomberg, goodwill, basically the amount paid over the book value of the target firm in an acquisition, in the S&amp;P 500 companies have more than doubled on a per-share basis as companies have paid an increasingly higher takeover premium over the underlying asset value (i.e. goodwill) for the past decade.¬† Why do you think these companies supposedly with some of the best financial minds in the world at their disposal would overpay that much for another company? ¬†A large part of it is that M&amp;A is still one of the quicker and easier way to generate some positive buzz juicing up company stock. ¬†Hungry for future top-line growth (which is usually tied to executive pay) in a lack-luster world economy, corporation executives are more inclined overlook certain "ambiguity."¬† Furthermore, increasing foreign acquisition in new/developing markets has also increased the risk of accounting discrepancy or min-interpretation more than most people have realized. ¬†Of course, the unprecedented synchronized QEs from world's central banks have a big hand in over-valuation in almost all asset class as well.¬† It typically takes at least 2-3 years for companies to realize the full synergy, or discovering the dog, of an acquisition. ¬†Bloomberg quoted Erin Lyons, a Citigroup Inc. credit strategist, that some 44 companies listed on U.S. exchanges are potential candidates for write-downs, and that three S&amp;P 500 companies -- Frontier Communications Corp.

Getty Images/ Mark WilsonCiti financial services analyst Keith Horowitz took a trip to JPMorgan to sit down with Jamie Dimon, and pick his brain about the state of his company, the world of financial services, and the broader, global economy. In their conversation, Dimon revealed a few of the things that are on his mind these days. Horowitz writes: Dimon noted four main risks that he worries about... 1) Geopolitical fat-tail risks such as Middle East unrest, 2) Europe ‚Äì which has made progress, but still could surprise as politicians have reduced, but not removed risks, 3) Uncertainty regarding the end to QE3 stimulus, and 4) US policy, long-term fiscal imbalances and entitlement programs. What's interesting is what he's not worried about: ... And not citing regulatory risk was interesting. He even pointed out that while margins may come down, market share may increase due to a ‚Äúbigger moat‚Äù - We were surprised that regulatory risk was not mentioned as one of the key risks. In Dimon‚Äôs eyes, higher capital rules, Volcker, and OTC derivative reforms longer-term make it more expensive and tend to make it tougher for smaller players to enter the market, effectively widening JPM‚Äôs ‚Äúmoat.‚Äù While there will be some drags on profitability ‚Äì as prices and margins narrow, efficient scale players like JPM should eventually be able to gain market share. This last part is really interesting, and will be used by people who think that ultimately regulation serves to benefit, not encumber, existing players. And even if large, systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) face a surcharge/capital fee, Dimon believes that the "synergies" of a large organization will help overcome these financial burdens.
Good morning. Here's what you need to know.
Bill Ackman will be happy when he wakes up today. Shares of Herbalife ‚Äî the company on which he has a massive short position ‚Äî are getting crushed in the pre-market.  Blame the New York Post for the selloff. Michelle Celarier at the paper is reporting that the company is subject to an FTC investigation: Embattled Herbalife is feeling the heat ‚Äî and this time it isn‚Äôt coming from a hedge-fund mogul.¬† The Los Angeles-based distributor of nutritional products is the subject of a law enforcement investigation, The Post has learned.¬† The existence of the probe emerged after the Federal Trade Commission, responding to a Freedom of Information Law request by The Post. It's not clear at all from the report if anything will come of this. Basically there have been a lot of complaints over the years from people unhappy with the product/service.
Italy is getting slammed today. The benchmark FTSE MIB stock index is down over 2.1%. What's going on? People are worried about the upcoming election. Nomura's Andy Chaytor explains the brewing political risk: In Italy, our economists note that the market is underpricing political risk ahead of this monthís elections. After promising to abolish and refund a tax on first homes implemented by Prime Minister Monti, former Prime Minister Berlusconiís centre-right coalition is expected to continue eating away at the lead held by Mr Bersaniís centre-left coalition. Meanwhile, Mr Montiís coalition has again lost third place to the Five Star Movement in the latest polls.† While our economists maintain their baseline scenario of a centre-left majority in both houses of parliament, they note that in the increasingly likely scenario that Mr Bersani fails to gain a majority in the Upper House, an alliance with the coalition led by Mr Monti is more likely than new elections. Nevertheless, they note that both the share of undecided voters (up to 35% according to the average of the latest three polls) and, as a corollary, the risk of ungovernability remain very high. While official publication of polling data will stop on Saturday, it will continue on some social networking sites, and our economists note that changes in the share of undecided voters will be ìthe most important factor to inform political risk and ungovernability.î
The euro has been the hottest currency in the world. But today it's getting clobbered. Between fears in Spain, Italy (and oh yeah, Cyprus), combined with this week's upcoming ECB meeting, folks have a reason to dump euros. Via FinViz, here's the intraday chart. FinViz
We mentioned earlier that there was weakness in Europe today, as fears grow about the political situation in both Italy and Spain. Equity-wise, Italy is taking the brunt. The market is down over 1.6%. Here's an intraday chart of the Italian stock index, the FTSE MIB. FTSE MIB Meanwhile, Spanish yields are jumping. On the all-important Spanish 2-Year bond, borrowing costs are going from 2.46% to 2.60%, a fairly meaningful jump at that level.

glutnix via FlickrAt this point there's so much talk about the "Great Rotation!" and "Stocks!" that an article like this one, by E.S. Browning at WSJ on the mood at investment clubs seems out of place, but very useful. Whereas Barron's is proclaiming that stocks will head to new highs, members of various investment clubs throughout the country are getting discouraged. At the Old Bay Investment Club near Baltimore, four members quit last year. In northern New Jersey, investment-club devotee Tony Maiello used to draw 15 curious people a month to recruitment meetings. Several recent meetings attracted no new faces at all. "It used to be that if you went by the numbers, you could pick a pretty good stock, but that isn't as true anymore," says William Pearce, president of the Maryland club. "When the market takes a hit, even the good stocks take a hit." Despite the fact that stocks have been in a bull market for nearly four years now (it's been that long) investors are still feeling burnt, and scared of downside. One head of a stock investing club quotes members as saying that buy-and-hold investing seems like a myth to people now... again, even as stocks have recovered nicely from the crash. Meanwhile, Josh Brown has a great post up on how the average investor thinks about the market these days. Basically, the sense of euphoria and over-enthusiasm felt by many who watch the market day-to-day isn't nearly as intense once you step out of that circle. People still feel burnt and crushed. Some of his points: The public is beginning to find out but they are mostly clueless as to what's been happening for the past few years. Clueless by design, they've chosen to allow the markets to exist without their active or knowing participation - even those with ongoing 401(k) contributions. And they are hardly confident in their decision to dip a toe in - flows are gravitating toward US large cap value, emerging markets indexes and dividend vehicles, hardly the stuff of reckless speculation. ... We know that the newspapers are all very resource-constrained and that they rely heavily on wire service and AP coverage in general - but if this market move were truly happening in the context of a popular mania or some such grand gold rush, you'd better believe there would be original coverage by actual reporters. Think about housing euphoria or the stock market mania of 15 years ago. ... And so , yes, there is curiosity about stocks once again, there is interest. But there is also dubiousness, apprehension, suspicion and leeriness. ... Because that would be early. (Read Josh's full post here) Bottom line, yes, the Animal Spirits are in the air again. Bigger picture, the idea of widespread euphoria, the type that should scare you, is nonsense.
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese entrepreneur Zhu Jiang didn't need a stock market to raise cash for his media startup. Impatient to tap investors even though Beijing has frozen new share sales, Zhu started flogging stock on shopping website Taobao.com. Before Taobao's owner Alibaba Groupshut down his virtual store on Monday, saying the platform wasn't allowed to host share offerings, Zhu had pulled in a total of 1.2 million yuan ($192,700) from more than 1,000 online punters. "For start-ups, time is life," Zhu, founder of Beijing-based video content producer Makev, said on his official microblog on Sunday. "We cannot afford to wait in a long queue for funding approvals, and there's little chance to get bank lending. So this is the practical solution." In October, China's securities regulator suspended initial public offerings, an effort to help stabilize the country's volatile stock market. The stoppage is likely to last until the end of March. Thousands of types of consumer goods, cars and real estate are up for sale on Taobao, but it "does not allow the listing of (shares) on the platform and ... has taken immediate action to remove such listings from the website", an Alibaba spokeswoman said in an e-mailed statement. Lu Fang, a spokeswoman for Makev, said the cash raised from online shoppers has already met the firm's fundraising target. Before it was shut down, Makev's virtual Taobao store was selling vouchers representing 100 Makev shares for 120 yuan ($19.27). Taobao is China's largest e-commerce platform with nearly 500 million registered users and more than 800 million product listings at any given time. It is unlisted on any share market.

When the debt ceiling hike was agreed to in 2011, the GOP demanded spending cuts, which Obama was obviously keen to avoid, especially in a weak economy, and needing to face re-election. So the deal was this. There would be no spending cuts until 2013, and even those spending cuts would disappear if a "super-committee" could come up with a long-term deficit reduction package. The premise of those 2013 spending cuts is that they were noxious to both parties, and that they were bad policy, and so both sides would have an incentive to avoid them. Well obviously the super-committee failed to avert them, and there's a growing consensus that in the next few weeks, they won't be avoided. The GOP, which has thirsted for cuts for a long time, is basically sticking a flag into the ground, saying the sequester will happen. Game over. Last week, Tom Philpott writing in military newspaper Stars &amp; Stripes, had a brutal editorial on what the sequester meant for the armed forces: Congressional leaders appear to have reach consensus that it is safer politically to allow deep and arbitrary cuts to military budgets than it is to negotiate a large debt-reduction deal that would have names attached. With Republicans and Democrats unwilling to make difficult decisions to address budget deficits in a balanced way, the military is being forced to cut training, cancel construction projects, defer maintenance of ships, aircraft and vehicles, cancel professional conferences, halt most temporary duty assignments, and interrupt supply and equipment purchases. Quality of life for the military also is being impacted as dependents lose jobs, local economies and businesses lose contracts, and base operations, including family support programs, take immediate budget cuts. The entire Department of Defense has imposed a civilian-hiring freeze. At least 46,000 temporary employees are getting pink slips and many more employees under ‚Äúterm‚Äù contracts won‚Äôt see those contracts renewed. Part of the reason for the frustration is not just the cuts per se, but rather the arbitrary nature of them, hence the lopping off of activity across the Department of Defense. In his Morning Money letter today, POLITICO's Ben White writes that from the view of DC insiders, the sequester remains on. SEQUESTER STATUS: STILL HAPPENING ‚Äì Consensus among insiders remains that the sequester cuts will hit, at least temporarily, but could get modified or changed in a deal later in March that wraps in the continuing resolution funding the government. But there is still little clarity on exactly what Republicans will push for in terms of spending cuts in any final deal or what precisely they will use as leverage. Whatever the case, weeks of posturing remain and nothing will get done until the last possible moment. While a military drawdown may be justified, the rapid, across-the-board cuts will have a negative effect on the economy. Remember, just last week we got the worst GDP reading since the crisis, thanks to the fastest drop in military spending since 1972. Bloomberg, Business Insider The increased likelihood of the sequester has caused Goldman's Jan Hatzius to change his roadmap for GDP. The good news is that he still sees no recession: We expect the US economy to move over the hump of fiscal contraction in 2013-2014. This hump looks even more front-loaded than when we rolled out our forecast late last year. We now expect a more rapid ramp-up of the federal spending ‚Äúsequester‚Äù by late 2013, compared with the more gradual phase-in that we had assumed earlier. ... We have adjusted our real GDP growth forecasts to the changes in the fiscal assumptions and the economic data. We now expect a rebound in real GDP growth to 2.6% in Q1 as the one-off drags unwind. The more front-loaded sequester is likely to push growth down to 1¬Ω%-2% in Q2/Q3, ¬Ω point less than our prior forecast. However, we expect growth to accelerate thereafter to around 3¬Ω% in most of 2014. Of course, with both the tax part of the fiscal cliff and the debt ceiling, people went in with a lot of pessimism, and things turned out alright. We still have some time before March 1 to get this taken care of. SEE ALSO: Goldman's Hatzius answers the 10 most important questions of the year &gt;
The new Prime Minister of Japan, Shinzo Abe, has stoked a lot of excitement in financial and economic circles, that with this fiscal and monetary easing, he might be able to get Japan out of its slump. The Nikkei has been surging in recent months, and inflation expectations are on the rise. But while Animal Spirits are in the air once again, investors harbor a concern that it may all be impossible. In a note to clients, Citi FX analyst Steven Englander reports on a recent client trip to Hong Kong, and explains what people are saying there about the yen, the impact on the region, and the prospects for Japan. Note the second view here, especially. Clients are divided. There is a clear sense that the move is helping Japanese corporations that go head to head with Asian competitors, particularly in Taiwan, Korea and Singapore. Roughly speaking the expectation seems to be that another 10 percent move in USDJPY will generate about 3 or 4 percent weakening in Asian competitors.¬† However, there is a second view, which is that Japan is structurally impaired and its loss of competitiveness is as much due to the lack of dynamism and innovation in the Japanese economy. The view is that Japanese products have lost their lustre, and that consumers won‚Äôt necessarily flock back to Japanese products because they are not viewed as innovative or edgy. Some clients made the distinction between products such as autos, in which price was viewed as a major factor, and electronics, where branding mattered more. This argument was also made by Henny Sender in the FT, that no amount of yen depreciation was going to make people switch from a Samsung phone to a Sony phone. On the surface, there's definitely something too this, and Sony is of course the poster child for a formerly innovative company that's just collapsed from the global consumer stage. However as also noted, Toyota doesn't seem to have a dynamism problem, and there are numerous other firms that you don't hear about as much at all, and which are selling high-tech industrial equipment to growing markets. That being said, after years and years of weak growth, it's plausible that structural impairment would grow, and dynamism would decline. So the theory is intriguing and worth thinking about more.

Denis Doyle/ Getty ImagesThis weekend we pointed out that there are some some reasons to raise an eyebrow about the situation unfolding in Europe. A potentially major corruption scandal is swirling around Spanish PM Mariano Rajoy. And in Italy, a coming election has people quietly nervous. Today we're seeing selling in the stock and bond front in both of those countries. Italian stocks are down 1.3%. Spain is down 0.5% (it was down 1.7% on Friday). Two years borrowing costs in both countries is jumping a bit... not huge but notably. Other than that: US futures a down a touch, while Asia was higher modestly.
