AP/Illustration by Mike Nudelman On an overcast Friday afternoon last August, a hundred or so employees of AOL's local news subsidiary, Patch, crammed into a cafeteria at the company's headquarters in Manhattan. Another several hundred connected to the room via conference call. They were waiting to hear CEO Tim Armstrong deliver bad news. The cafeteria's lights were low, and the semi-darkness reflected the mood. So did the body language. People slumped over the cafeteria's tables, shoulders low. They stood around the edges of the room with their arms crossed in front of them. This was Armstrong's second visit to Patch that week. Two days earlier, Armstrong had come to the office and told everyone he planned to honor a promise he'd made to AOL's shareholders to make Patch profitable by the end of the year. He had said he was going to meet with AOL's board of directors the following day to decide on a plan. He had said he would come back Friday to announce it. Jim RomeneskoNow, the gathered Patch employees expected to hear the depressing details: Making Patch profitable, presumably, would involve mass layoffs â€” layoffs that would probably include many people in the room. Armstrong stood at the front of the room against a white wall, wearing a dark suit and no tie. He began his speech in his usual deep monotone:Â "There are a couple things I want you guys to realize and really think about and let sink in. And if it doesn't sink in and you don't believe what I'm about to say, I'm going to ask you to leave Patch. I don't mean that in a harsh way, I mean that we have to get Patch to a place where it's going to be successful, and successful for a long time." Armstrong, who had been the first sales boss at Google, is famous for his rally-the-troops speeches. If not for the sense of dread that accompanied it, this one might have been winding up to be another. Heating up, Armstrong talked about how "you can blame me" for everything that has gone wrong at Patch, and "I don't care what the press says." He commanded everyone in the room to fully commit themselves to the company. Then something strange happened. Armstrong interrupted himself to say, "Abel, put that camera down right now." Then, without taking a breath, he said, "Abel, you're fired." For five seconds, the room went silent. Finally, Armstrong started speaking again. He said: "If you guys think that AOL has not been committed to Patch, and won't stay committed to Patch, you're wrong." These were motivational words that ordinarily would have fired up everyone in the room.Â But they didn't â€¦ because, not surprisingly, everyone seemed stunned by what Armstrong had just done. Soon, hundreds of thousands of people beyond the walls of AOL's headquarters would feel the same sense of shock. Patch employees â€” reporters after all â€” began leaking details of the meeting almost immediately. Darrell Etherington of AOL-owned tech news site TechCrunch published the first story about the meeting. It said that Armstrong had "fired an employee who took his photo." "Our tipster said the public nature of the termination struck them as 'shameful and disgusting' behavior,"Â Etherington added.Â  Soon, media guru Jim Romenesko jumped in, identifying the "Abel" who got fired as Abel Lenz, a Patch creative director who had helped redesign the site. Then, the following evening, the story got much worse for AOL and Armstrong. One of the several hundred Patch employees who had dialed into the meeting had recorded the call. This person sent the recording to Jim Romenesko, who published it. Written reports citing whispers from anonymous sources about Armstrong's behavior at the meeting were one thing. A recording of his speech was something else: Raw, alarming, and strange. The recording also revealed an odd juxtaposition. Just before firing Lenz for taking a photo during a confidential meeting, Armstrong had said, "I donâ€™t care if people leak information â€¦ leaking information or anything around Patch isnâ€™t going to bother me â€” doesnâ€™t bother me." The impulsive firing on the heels of this statement made Armstrong sound unhinged â€” "schizophrenic in his thinking" is how a source close to him later described it. Several days later, Armstrong apologized privately to Abel Lenz and then publicly to AOL employees. But, by then,Â mainstream outlets including Yahoo and the Daily Mail had picked up the news. Some people viewed the public firing as a bad-ass CEO move, the kind of thing that a famously demanding executive like Steve Jobs or Larry Ellison might have done. But most people across the country and world saw it as gratuitous and humiliating: What's wrong with Tim Armstrong, people wondered? What kind of CEO fires some poor guy in front of all his colleagues? What did this say about what was going on at AOL?Â  LISTEN: Audio of Abel Lenz's firingAs someone who had frequently covered Armstrong and AOL over the years, I wondered, too. Â A few days after the firing I asked one of Armstrong's former colleagues at AOL about it. This person surprised me by saying how ordinary Armstrong's speech was. "This is how numb you get," the executive said. "For Tim, that was actually pretty coherent. On a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the craziest, that was like a 3 or a 4." That was startling. But it was also only one person's view of the situation. So, over the next month, I spoke to dozens more sources, including several who currently work with Armstrong at AOL. And I spent several hours with Armstrong himself. Through these interviews, I learned the backstory of how Tim Armstrong ended up at the front of that half-lit room that Friday in August. I also understood better why he sounded so uncomfortable at the meeting. And why he fired Abel Lenz. After a depressing 12 years of decline, the industry powerhouse of the 1990's, AOL, is finally stabilizing. Its stock is finally moving steadily higher again. Earlier this week, AOL reported third quarter financial results that beat Wall Street expectations and marked three consecutive quarters of advertising revenue growth. This was a success that several AOL CEOs before Tim Armstrong had not been able to achieve. But Armstrong would not have been able to achieve that success without paying a price. In trying to turn around a huge, collapsing company, Armstrong has had to make many hard, sometimes deeply unpopular, decisions. It was one of the hardest of these that put him in the front of that room last August. In drastically cutting back Patch, morever, Armstrong wasn't just letting hundreds of loyal employees go. He was killing the AOL project that he had been most devoted to, a company that he himself had created. Decisions like these are hard, especially for a highly likable executive who has built his career on his ability to inspire people and build relationships. Â That Friday in August, Armstrong was finally making a decision that he had needed to make for a long time. And it was killing him. Armstrong was, in that moment, paying the cost of winning. For so long, it was a price he had never had to pay.
It is hard.Â  Just because people speak English, do not be deceived.Â  It is an utterly alien place from America culturally, and I found (and still find) the adjustments frustrating and I sometimes still get furious from the difficulties. One of the biggest realities is the drop in the material standard of living.Â  British wages are not as high as in the US and things are more expensive.Â  Obviously, this impacts on lifestyle. Houses are very expensive and you will live in a house half the size you'd expect in the US, often attached to your neighbour and with a one car garage (if you are lucky).Â  There are no basements, so you feel cramped and everything is cluttered -- I've never seen a walk-in closet to date.Â  You will cram everything into a 'wardrobe' the size of your coat closet. My friends living like this are Oxford and Cambridge grads in IT in London, teachers, engineers, journalists -- all university grads.Â  There are, of course, higher levels up from this but it is generally those connected to the City, oil executives or high flyers.Â  Doctors will live higher up the scale, but not to American standards.Â  Pharmacists have low 5 figure salaries, even though they hold chemistry degrees - a huge disparity, same with nursing.Â  You will eat sandwiches in your office, not go out for lunch as is done daily in the US.Â  You will not have a garbage disposal, and will be expected to hang your laundry out to dryÂ  (fighting the rain the whole time -- having to check weather reports, can you believe?).Â  Household work is more time consuming as the conveniences built into newer housing just aren't there. Â  But there are pubs!Â  Pubs are an Englishman's refuge and the place where you meet up with mates for a quick pintÂ  - guys and gals â€” as a routine part of 'friend maintenance.' Â  Our groceries are orderedÂ on the internet and delivered to our front door -- as is typical for all supermarkets.Â  We live on the 'High Street' in our village -- bakeries, cafes, barber, grocery store and bus stop are located there, and three pubs of course.Â  The train station to London is an 8 minute walk. My daughter is 14 and has 11 subject areas:Â  Latin, Greek, French, Chemistry, Biology, Physics, Advanced Maths, History, English, English Lit and Music (theory, performance and composition).Â  SheÂ  anticipates fluency in French at 17.Â  The education system is exam based, there is no GPA.Â  She wants to study medicine and as med school begins freshman year, she has already begun pre-med coaching sessions at school. Brits get a lot more time off -- 5 weeks as a rule -- and travel is a priority.Â  The cultural aspects of the country are fascinating - tiny it may seem,Â  but it takes a lifetime to know this place, and with Europe so close it is expanded even further.Â  AÂ massiveÂ advantage of living here is the National Health Service.Â  If an American could understand it, they would be amazed by its magnificence. Â  In this past week I have seen an ENT consultant surgeon and have had surgery scheduled in a few weeks' time.Â  There was no direct cost to me. Tonight my GP (family doctor) rang at 8pm to check in on another health issue.Â  She is chasing a consultant to authorise a new medication and will ring me back next week.Â  This did not cost me a penny. Â  So, three doctors and one medical procedure without a form to fill in or a bill to pay.Â  Pretty damn impressive stuff --yes, I know it is in our taxes but the system works well.Â  It is 'from birth to grave' care all woven together into one service -- ambulance to GP to hospital to nursing care.Â  There are all kinds of synergies created by such a system.Â  It is to be deeply respected, emulated, and not feared. Another advantage is the lack of gridlock in politics -- we are being spared the current ugliness in the US, and the safety nets of good employment law, disability rights and maternity/paternity leave are reassuring. The infrastructure of the country is in a much better state...there are no derelict buildings or crumbling roads.Â  There is greater acceptance and less stigma in being a racial minority (although still far from easy). Gay marriage has been in place a long time and is a non-issue. And best of all (to me):Â  the deeply inbuilt intellectualism -- world class museums, theatres, concerts, bookshops, lecturesÂ everywhere. People jump to conclusions about Brits being unfriendly but this is simply an American reaction to the British cultural norm of avoiding relationships that are superficial.Â  Once you are a friend, it is sincere and has a depth and permanence that outlasts many of those I had in the U.S. I do miss the affiliation to college sports, as my friends all gather for all the big football games at our university and have a great party -- there is no such culture here.Â  There are the big football games -- but it's professional sport just like the NFL.Â  The World Cup rivals the Super Bowl, however. I would give my right arm for an American washer and dryer, and you won't understand this unless you've seen the laundry situation here. As I type this, our laundry is hanging in the family room, damp, and when dry must be ironed.Â  All Brits iron, or hire someone to do it.Â  This is a personal 'I hate Britain'Â rage issue for me.Â  No place is perfect, I know.Â  But having to hang clothes out to dry in February? In spite of this, Britain is a place that you can come to love as your own.Â  The countryside is stunningly beautiful and I am grateful for the hours I spend driving in it.Â  Bunnies hop, pheasant fly and fox dash around me every day.Â  Yet London remains close at hand. The BritsÂ have extremely strict zoning restrictions and there are no 'strip malls' -- not anywhere.Â  So you drive for an hour straight and won't see a petrol (gas) station or any commercial building sticking out like a sore thumb. Â  There is a deep love and care for the countryside that makes it compelling, and you can never tire of it.Â  It is the work of a thousand years -- a landscape built by man, layer by layer.Â  A masterpiece.Â  When you watch Downton Abbey, you are seeing the actual house and landscape of an aristocratic family in Hampshire - one hour from where I live. Just look at the size of those cedar trees outside the front of the house.Â  All the rooms and lands you are seeing areÂ realÂ without alteration (except for the downstairs servant quarters). Â  I live minutes from Petworth HouseÂ  - a house of equal magnificence, built in Palladian style with a 1000 acre deer park.Â  It is breathtaking to behold, landscaped by 'Capability' Brown.Â  The inside is just as amazing, filled with paintings by Turner, Van Dyke and endless architectural treasures. These houses span across the countryside.  There is so much the British have to be proud of - and the subject of 'the' War has an awesomeness all of its own. Brits are stubborn and won't be beaten -- the Nazis discovered that one!Â  Ugly cement blocks plonked around my street are leftovers of a planned blockade against Panzer tanks -- the sheerÂ ballsÂ of a small village readied to resist such a massively dangerous foe is, to me, stunning. The military has a proud heritage and is so highly regarded that the Royals feel a deep attachment to it -- including Princes William and Harry. The weather... it does drizzle hereÂ a lotÂ but it doesn't get very cold. People get on with cycling, hiking, andÂ Â  pretty much everything but it can mess up summer weddings.Â  ItÂ  certainlyÂ  is not a Californian sun zone . .people go to Spain.I have found the financial drop in living a lot harder than I thought it would be.Â  The differences between me and my American friends in terms of material possessions is large. They are better off in all financial areas of their life -- except property prices*.Â  However, a lot of the feeling about financial difference is lost over time -- we now tend to reference our lives with our British peers.Â Â When we go back home there is a massive shock and whoops of laughter at the bigness of everything. Yes, I do envy those closets and everything being on sale.Â  Yet it also brings awareness of the wastefulness of American culture -- those gallon size soft drink containers and 100 other excesses are fun for a few weeks' holiday, but then we've had enough.Â  Being in England teaches carefulness with resources (gas $8/gallon), and I am happy my children live within these constraints.To make a move here you should be fully prepared for how expensive it is, the lower wages, and the resulting drop in your (material) standard of living.Â  If this is not of concern to you, and you want all the gains outlined above, then living here is quite good.Â Britain has afforded me a window into a world beyond my wildest Midwest imagination.Â  For this I am grateful.Â  I don't know if I could happily re-integrate into America now.Â  Perhaps on the coasts.Â  Saying that, I hold America dear and defend it daily.Â  It was once explained to me by another ex-pat thatÂ  I am 'Mid-Atlantic' -- caught in the middle of the ocean, unable to decide which direction is home.*if you work in the City, you will find things comparable to Wall Street.Â  It is a separate world - entirely - from how normal Brits live.
REUTERS/Toru HanaiAsian markets are modestly lower on Thursday, as markets gear up for the European Central Bank's meeting. Here's a quick round-up: All eyes will be on China's upcoming 3rd Plenum which kicks off on November 9.
REUTERS/Carlos BarriaAll eyes are on the upcoming 3rd Plenum of the 18th Communist Party of China (CPC). Slated to take place between Nov. 9 to 12 in Beijing this is often a platform in which Chinese officials announce crucial reforms.  We reached out to Bill Bishop, author of the must-read Sinocism China Newsletter, to understand why these meetings are so important and what reforms we can expect this year.  Business Insider: What is the 3rd Plenum? Bill Bishop: A Plenum is a meeting of the Communist Party’s Central Committee. This Central Committee has 205 full and 167 alternate members, chosen at the First Plenum of the 18th Party Congress in November 2012. Each Party Congress lasts for 5 years, and with the exception of the first year there is usually one Plenum held per year. The Politburo, comprised of 25 members, meets more regularly, and the Standing Committee, made up of 7 members, meets even more frequently. Xi Jinping is the General Secretary of the Party and also holds the top posts in the State (President) and Military (Chairman of the Central Military Commission) Third Plenums are seen as important because the First Plenum introduces the new leadership, the Second Plenum tends to be personnel- and Party construction-focused, while the third one is usually seen as the first plenary session at which the new leadership has basically consolidated power and can introduce a broader economic and political blueprint.BI: Why is it significant? BB: Not all Third Plenums are that significant, and plenty of reforms have happened outside of a Third Plenum, But, the Third Plenum of the 11th Party Congress in December 1978, held just two years after the death of Chairman Mao, the end of the Cultural Revolution and the arrest of the gang of Four, launched “reform and opening” and put China on its current path.  The Third Plenum of the 14th Party Congress, held in November 1993, formally endorsed the concept of “Socialist market Economy”, which provided the theoretical foundation and political cover for a more aggressive set of economic reforms pushed by then-Premier Zhu RongjiBI: What reforms should we expect at the 3rd Plenary Session of the 18th CPC?  BB: The top leadership has recently repeatedly said that the Third Plenum will introduce comprehensive and unprecedented reforms. The hope is that the Plenum will introduce land ownership and transfer reforms, broader financial reforms, changes to the household registration system that give rural residents greater rights and social protections, changes to the center-local fiscal relationships, more trade liberalization to increase openness, policies designed to try to spur innovation, factor price reform that may weaken State-Owned Enterprises (SOE), reduction of administrative interference in the economy, and a 5 year plan to combat corruption. I expect a fairly ambitious report to be issued at the end of the Plenum, but it will take years and many bureaucratic battles and permutations before all of the effects are felt.  BI: What reforms do you think will be sidelined?  BB: There may be some SOE reforms but we will not see talk of privatization. More likely there will be reforms that will weaken many of those SOEs, such as factor price reform. There will be political reform but not in the Western, liberal sense. The goal will be to make the party more efficient, responsible and accountable, all to ensure continued single Party rule.  Some people argue that China’s can not truly transform its economy without broader, liberal political reforms that unleash a “marketplace of ideas”, creativity and innovation. The leadership does not seem to agree with that argument.  Effectively combating corruption is key to most of these reforms. if the Party can not get corruption under control—not eradicate it, as that is unrealistic—then much of this will be just talk.  BI: What does this mean for the Chinese economy?   BB: It is unclear. Many of these changes will take years to implement, and some may be thwarted or distorted as they flow from the center down through the bureaucracies. But expect the overarching goal to be the transformation of the economic growth model and the de-emphasis of GDP. But an aggressive plenum report that lays out sweeping economic reforms may help change perceptions of both the near and medium term prospects for the economy. Xi Jinping believes he is leading China to its great national rejuvenation, and no one paying attention, especially the top leadership, thinks the current economic structure and growth model is sustainable.  BI: Why should investors care?  BB: If the leadership gets it right then China should be able to work through many of the current economic problems, albeit very painfully. If they do not, the country may be headed to severe distress in the next few years.  As for individual stocks, there are lots of local analysts putting out recommendations on stocks that could benefit and some have run up significantly ahead of the Plenum. At least in the short-term you may see smart investors “buying on the rumor and selling on the Plenum”, as there are so many expectations built into this upcoming meeting that it is hard to see how there will not be disappointment in the near-term. And expect many of the pundits and economists to express “disappointment” with whatever is in the report, so there may be a shift back toward more negative sentiment about China in overseas discourse.  But smart investors and entrepreneurs and executives know that there will be plenty of money-making opportunities for those who can understand what the report is really saying.  BI: Anything else you think our readers should know?  BB: Some of the most important reforms in China are not mandated from Beijing, either in Third Plenums or other meetings, but happen at the local levels and then are adopted in other areas around the country. So while the Plenum Report will be important, it will be far from the end of what reforms may occur in the country over the next few years.

The DrunkeynsianFA Insights is a daily newsletter from Business Insider that delivers the top news and commentary for financial advisors. ROSENBERG: In A Market That Knows No Fear I'm Reminded Of Bob Farrell's Investing Rules (Gluskin Sheff) "In a market that knows no fear," Gluskin Sheff's David Rosenberg writes that he's thinking of a few rules of investing from former legendary Merrill Lynch strategist Bob Farrell. 1. Rule #1, "markets tend to return to the mean over time." The S&amp;P 500 is already trading at 15.9x forward earnings, "above the cycle average of 14x and the mean for the past 10 years of around 15." 2. Rule #4, "exponential rising or falling markets usually go further than you think, but they do not correct by going sideways." The stock market is up 24% this year at a time when GDP growth forecasts have gone from 2% at the start of the year to 1.6%. 3. Rule #5, "the public buys most at the top and the least at the bottom." 4. Rule #9, "when all the experts and forecasts agree, something else is going to happen." 5. Rule #3 "fear and greed are stronger than long-term resolve." Traditional Advisory Firms Are Learning To Work With Online Advisory Sites (The Wall Street Journal)  Traditional financial advisers are beginning to work with online advisory sites reports Murray Coleman at The Wall Street Journal. Not only does this help them get more competitive, it also lets these advisory firms accept the business of smaller investors. "If you don't take advantage of some of the more innovative advisory services online, you're basically burying your head in the sand," Ross Almlie, president of TCI Financial Advisors told the WSJ. LPL Financial Is Top Contender For Advisors Looking To Jump Ship (FA Mag)  Advisors looking to jump ship favor LPL Financial and Raymond James according to Cogent's Advisor Channel Migration Trends report cited by FA Mag. Forty-nine percent of advisors would consider moving to LPL, while 44% would switch to Raymond James. Wells Fargo was the third favorite at 37%, followed by UBS and Commonwealth at 29% each. The U.S. Is Now A Better Growth Story Than The Emerging Markets (Richard Bernstein Advisors) "Our analyses through the years have clearly demonstrated that stock market performance is more closely tied to profits cycles than to economic cycles," writes Rich Bernstein of Richard Bernstein Advisors. Markets are more concerned with corporate profits but emerging market investors are more focused on GDP growth.  In the past year, 55-60% of emerging market companies had negative earnings surprises, compared with 25-30% in the U.S. What's more, "EM companies’ long-term growth projections are not superior."  "US small cap companies offer superior growth to that offered by the emerging markets. The US is now a better growth story than are the emerging markets!" SEC Bans Former Merrill Lynch Broker From Securities Industry (Investment News) The SEC has banned James R. Lanier, a former Bank of America Merrill Lynch broker, from the securities industry for stealing $1 million from clients, reports Trevor Hunnicutt at Investment News. The SEC said Lanier forged client signatures and used the money to invest in a cellular telecommunications business and purchase things for himself.  "Lanier was convicted of wire fraud, mail fraud, money laundering, and aggravated identify theft. ...He was sentenced to 106 months of incarceration and a five-year term of post-release supervision and ordered to pay $887,931 in restitution."

In fact, the most heavily-shorted stocks have been outperforming the S&amp;P 500. Still, the shorts are holding strong and waiting patiently to clean-up when stock prices fall. In our latest list of stocks traders are shorting like crazy, some popular targets have fallen off. For instance: Best Buy, Netflix, and First Solar, who have each recently appeared in this space, are out. Instead, short sellers seem to have shifted their focus to oil, gas and raw materials stocks, which continue to face exposure to falling prices. There do remain some old standbys in for-profit education and retail. We ranked the stocks by short interest as a percentage of floating shares.
The stock market and the economy are not the same thing. They may be related, but their growth rates differ because they are based on and driven by very different things. "It is not unreasonable for an investor to associate rapid economic growth with strong stock market returns," write Vanguard's Joseph Davis, Roger Aliaga-Diaz, Charles Thomas, and Ravi Tolani. "And anyone who regularly follows the financial markets probably has the sense that economic data releases can drive market performance." In a report titled "The Outlook For Emerging Market Stocks In A Lower-Growth World," the authors examined long-run equity market returns and real GDP growth for 46 countries and found the correlation to be very weak and inconsistent. "At 4.0% per year, the average real equity market return for the countries with the three highest GDP growth rates was slightly below the 4.2% average return for the countries with the three lowest GDP growth rates, despite the considerable difference in those rates (8.0% a year versus 1.6%, on average)," they found. "It is clear that the correlation between these two variables is weak." "These results may not quite line up with investor intuition," they write. Vanguard
REUTERS/Eliana Aponte Bitcoin is back in the news, as the digital currency has surged to new all-time highs in recent weeks. A few weeks ago, it was just above $100. Today it's over $260. This surge has prompted Timothy B Lee at The Washington Post to ask whether those who have called it a bubble in the past should retract and admit that they were wrong. Well I'm not totally sure if I've called it a bubble, but I have spoken negatively of it, and I'll say that I still think it's a joke, and probably in a bubble. Now first of all, I find the premise of Lee's post to be hilarious. The currency has been surging several percent every day lately, and that's evidence that it's not in a bubble? Before going on, I want to be clear that saying something is a bubble is not saying it will go down. It could go to $500 or $1000 or $10,000. That's the nature of manias. But make no mistake, Bitcoin is not the currency of the future. It has no intrinsic value. Now this idea of "intrinsic value" when it comes to currency bothers people, and Bitcoin Bugs will immediately ask why the U.S. dollar has intrinsic value. There's an answer to that. The U.S. Dollar has intrinsic value because the U.S. government which sets the laws of doing business in the United States says it has intrinsic value. If you want to conduct commerce in the United States you have to pay taxes, and there's only one currency you're allowed to pay taxes in: U.S. dollars. There's no getting around this fact. Furthermore, if you want to use the banking system at all, there's no choice but to use U.S. dollars, because that's the currency of the Fed which is behind the whole thing. On top of all these laws requiring the U.S. dollar to be used, the United States has a gigantic military that can force people around the world to use dollars (if it came to that) so yes, there's a lot of real-world value behind greenbacks. Bitcoin? Nada. There's nothing keeping it being a thing. If people lose faith in it, it's over. Bitcoin is fiat currency in the most literal sense of the word. But it gets worse. Bitcoin is mostly just a speculative vehicle. Yes, there are PR stunts about bars and other shops accepting bitcoins. And there is a Bitcoin ATM for some reason. But mostly Bitcoin is a speculative vehicle. And really, you'd be insane to actually conduct a sizable amount of commerce in bitcoins. That's because the price swings so wildly, that the next day, there's a good chance that one of the parties will have gotten royally screwed. Either the purchaser of the good will have ended up totally blowing a huge opportunity (by not holding longer) or the seller will be totally screwed (if Bitcoin instantly plunges). The very volatility that excited people to want to play the Bitcoin game is death when it comes to real transactions in the real world. Again, Bitcoin might go up a lot more before it ultimately ends. That's the nature of bubbles. The dotcom bubble crashed a bunch of times on its way up. Then one day it ended. The same will happen with this. In the meantime, have fun speculating!
The company provided a Q4 earnings outlook of -$0.55 to -$0.65 versus a consensus of -$0.54 according to Bloomberg. It reaffirmed that it plans to deploy 101 megawatts of capacity in Q4. "With new energy contracts, MW booked, MW deployed, and operating lease revenue all reaching new highs in Q3 2013, SolarCity continues to demonstrate that demand, execution, and financing remain strong tailwinds supporting growth toward our one million customer goal by mid-2018," said CEO Lyndon Rive. "Moreover, with estimated nominal contracted payments remaining rising to $1.7 billion and cumulative retained value per Watt up to $1.37/W, we are not only creating more value every day but also retaining more value for shareholders with each new customer signed." Tesla, the electric auto manufacturer run by Musk, closed down more than -14% today. The company announced in its Q3 earnings that vehicle deliveries missed expectations. Shares of First Solar are also down slightly after hours.
Rolls-RoyceThe Arizona desert is not the landscape usually associated with Rolls-Royce cars, but it turns out it's a great place to put one to the test. Last week, I made the cross-country trek to get behind the wheel of the Wraith, the sleek coupe that also happens to be the most powerful car ever to come from the ultra-luxury brand. It was wonderful. But for all its excellent, effortless performance, the Wraith is a bit alienating. There's no option to change gears yourself, no Sport mode you can select to ramp up the RPM and hear it roar. The car uses GPS to select gears before hitting hard turns, so you never feel the engine at work. Once you accept that even behind the wheel, you're kind of a passenger, you'll love the Wraith. The V12 engine sends you from 0 to 60 mph in 4.4 seconds. You close the doors via buttons. Fancy umbrellas pop out of surprising places. The roof emulates a star-filled sky. You can propel yourself down a desert highway and feel like you're on your couch. The Wraith starts for $284,900; the car we drove runs for $372,324. Full Disclosure: Rolls-Royce paid for our travel and lodging expenses to drive the Wraith.
Tomorrow Twitter will go public. You may be a little confused about how an IPO actually works. It's somewhat nuanced. The NYSE has this handy infographic that explains the whole thing. (Keep this in mind tomorrow when people are waiting for Twitter to start trading.) NYSE
Jack Dorsey's Square has a plan to be profitable by 2015 and is already considering an IPO, according to the Wall Street Journal. Square markets those small white add-ons that you can stick into any iPhone or iPad to instantly turn it into a cash register. They have been a huge hit with small businesses. Square has been discussing a public stock sale with Â Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. Founder Jack Dorsey owns 28.3% of Square, and his stake was already valued at well over $1 billion. In addition, as the founder of Twitter, he owns a stake in that company, too, which is about to become worth up to $679 million. The WSJ also reported a bunch of financials for Square: Square is growing nearly as fast as its soon-to-be-public sibling, with sales approaching $1 billion in 2014, according to an internal projection people familiar with the matter shared with the Wall Street Journal. That revenue represents what Square takes from the roughly $30 billion in total transactions it expects to process next year, before it passes much of that amount on to partnering credit card companies. Sales will be about $550 million this year on total payment volume of around $20 billion, these people said. Roughly 70% to 80% of Squareâ€™s revenue gets kicked back to credit card companies, putting the companyâ€™s net revenue closer to $110 million to $165 million. Though Dorsey has said publicly the company does not turn a profit, heâ€™s internally discussed a plan that would make Square profitable in 2015, according to one person familiar with the matter.

REUTERS/ Brendan McDermidNew York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly is in talks to take the "top security job" at JP Morgan, the New York Post'sÂ Mark DeCambreÂ andÂ Beth DeFalco report. Kelly may take the job before mayor-elect Bill de Blasio is sworn in, the Post reports. De Blasio has been an outspoken critic of Kelly' stop-and-frisk policy. From the Post: Kellyâ€™s potential position with JPMorgan Chase would make him responsible for security at the giant financial firm, with emphasis on cyber-security, people familiar with the ongoing talks said. Kellyâ€™s new job could come with a seven-figure package of salary and bonuses. The firmâ€™s senior security officer, Thomas Higgins, left about a month ago and has not been replaced. According to the report, Kelly has a "great rapport" with CEO Jamie Dimon. And it wouldn't be Kelly's first time on Wall Street. He worked at Bear Stearns during 2000-2001 as a "managing director for corporate security." Read the full report at the New York PostÂ Â»
The Cleveland Fed today released a study of gentrification patterns and the effect of gentrification on residents' financial health. Daniel Hartley, the author of the study, defines a neighborhood as gentrifying "if it is located in the central city of a metropolitan area and it goes from being in the bottom half of the distribution of home prices in the metropolitan area to the top half between 2000 and 2007", noting that housing prices are a good overall reflection of the economic health of a neighborhood. "Though all cities experienced some gentrification, most saw less than a third of neighborhoods with the potential to gentrify do so," wrote Hartley. "Four cities saw significant shares of the neighborhoods that could gentrify, do so: Boston (61 percent), Seattle (55 percent), New York (46 percent), and San Francisco (42 percent). In Boston, the gentrifying neighborhoods represented about a fourth of the entire cityâ€™s population. In other cities, the proportion was much smaller." Below is a list of U.S. metros in order of percentage of a city's low-price tracts that gentrified (third column). The following map, based on the data in the study, shows the cities with the largest percentage of their gentrifiable neighborhoods actually gentrifying: Google, Business Insider
Flickr/S.C. AsherWhat should I think about the Twitter IPO? Mostly you should think about Las Vegas, Nevada, as a number of important analogies apply here.[1] First – The Poker Table You know the rule that if you’re sitting at the poker table, and you’re not sure who the sucker is, then it must be you? That’s you, the retail buyer, in any IPO. Why do I say that? How do I know that? Buying an IPO as a retail investor – You do not have pocket Aces The people who have the most information about Twitter are the insiders in the business. They are the founders and the earliest private equity investors, and they know this business inside and out. They have lived and breathed this company since its existence. You have not. The next most knowledgeable people are the bankers and financiers, who evaluate newish companies, in emerging industries, with swiftly changing technologies, and uncertain cashflows, for a living. They live and breathe stories and companies like Twitter, which you do not. Now, at the poker table, the insiders and the bankers know their own cards, and they also know your cards, as well as the next few cards coming up on the flop, the turn, and the river. Nine out of the ten folks at the table in this transaction know more than you do. Interestingly, they are extraordinary friendly and welcoming of you at their poker table. You should not be thinking “Huh, this Twitter IPO looks like an Ace – Seven off-suit. If I can hit another Ace as a table card, I might do pretty well at this table with these so-called pros. That would be sweet!” No. Instead, you should be thinking: ”My what big eyes they have,” and “My, what large teeth they have.” Remember this: The insiders – the most knowledgeable people – with the help of their bankers – the next most knowledgeable people – are all selling their ownership in this company. They are indicating, in the clearest terms possible, that they believe the company is more valuable right now than it will be in the near future.[2] Do you doubt this? If the insiders believed – on a probabilistic basis – that the company will be worth significantly more 1 to 5 years from now, they would not be selling their ownership. They would wait for it to become more valuable. These are all rational, smart, people. You, on the other hand, are the easy mark. Have a seat. Come play poker with me. Second – Extraordinary Payouts “But,” you are quick to think, “I’m pretty sure from watching TV that there’s a lot of money being made somewhere in this IPO. Isn’t that what it’s all about?” Yes, this is true. State lotteries display big winners in their advertisements, and at press conferences. Casinos make sure to tout all the big jackpots their customers have made in slots, or poker tournaments, or on their easy roulette wheels and craps table. Everybody loves those goofy oversized checks And those winners are real people, with real payouts. But that is not your role, as a retail investor, in an IPO. You do not get that goofy oversized check. The people with the big payouts from the Twitter IPO are the insiders, the founders, the executives, and the early private equity backers of Twitter. The IPO represents a giant payout for them. The massive payouts to insiders give the Financial Infotainment Industrial Complex the equivalent of that goofy oversized check to breathlessly illustrate a big transaction like Twitter’s IPO. Remember, that payout is real, but it’s not for you. Third – The Flashing Lights, Whistles and Bells If you have walked the floor of any casino, the flashing lights and whistles and beeping buffeted you. These sounds and lights provide an untrustworthy signal that “Wow, somebody is making money here!” The Financial Infotainment Industrial Complex goes into high gear with an IPO like Twitter’s to provide the flashing lights and beeping and sound of coins dropping incessantly. Their goal – as always in all of this – is to capture newsstand sales, Nielson ratings, page views, and click-throughs, with emotionally gripping, eye-catching, events.[3] The Twitter IPO provides just such an event. A flashy score for a small group of entrepreneurs and investors is that opportunity for the clink-clank-clink-clink of Triple Cherries, just as you slip past, flushed with heightened oxygen levels, trying to navigate the purposefully crooked casino floor, on your way to the restroom. This is not how to think about an IPO outcome for you In sum, try to buy a piece of the casino, but do not gamble Unless you are an insider in some way to the Twitterverse, you have no business participating in the Twitter IPO, or practically any IPO for that matter. Don’t get me wrong: Investing in public companies – with a long time horizon – is a fabulous opportunity. I even took all of my 8 year-old daughter’s savings and invested them in the stock market to teach her about this opportunity. To extend the casino analogy even further, long-term stock ownership is like owning a piece of the casino. You may have short-term ups and downs, but in the long run the odds will work out in your favor because you have house-odds, and you will build wealth, almost inevitably. And also, please don’t get me wrong about Twitter. I’m agnostic about Twitter as an investment opportunity. I would describe every other highly-discussed IPO similarly.[4] I assume mutual funds that I own will end up purchasing some Twitter shares, and I’m perfectly fine with that, over the long run, and in a diversified portfolio. I love public stock ownership, and I’m happy for the few folks for whom this Twitter IPO will be a meaningful event. But the point here is that Twitter’s IPO is, and should be, entirely irrelevant to the rest of us and our financial lives. But the casino makes it hard for us to ignore it as we should. [1] Really, this applies to any IPO. I don’t mean to pick on Twitter, except I’m fairly sick of hearing about it and its IPO should be totally irrelevant to all but a few dozen people on this planet. [2] Warren Buffett on IPOs “It’s almost a mathematical impossibility to imagine that, out of the thousands of things for sale on a given day, the most attractively priced is the one being sold by a knowledgeable seller (company insiders) to a less-knowledgeable buyer (investors).” [3] If you have not walked the floor of a casino because you prefer to stay home and knit tea cozies, that’s cool. I admire you. Let me give you another analogy for the relationship between us and the Financial Infotainment Industrial Complex. We are the kittens. They hold the ball of string. [4] The last high profile IPO I wrote about, Facebook, I got to combine a favorite Wall Street phrase with a favorite classic rock lyric. And I was just as jaded about IPOs.
Wealth-X, an international wealth management firm, recently released a list of the richest person in every U.S. state. The top 10 individuals on the list — who all held the exact same spots on last year’s list — are collectively worth $362 billion. To put that in perspective, that's 67% of the total wealth of the top 50 list. Washington-based Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates was the richest individual on the list with an estimated net worth of $70.8 billion, followed by Nebraska's Warren Buffett with a personal fortune of roughly $60 billion. They're also two of the most philanthropic men on the list, haven given away a combined $48 billion in their lifetimes (so far). Take a look at the full list and the states the billionaires live in below. Mike Nudelman/Business Insider

 Glyn Lowe Photoworks via Compfight ccWhole Foods fell 10% to $58 in after-hours trading. This came after the company reported Q4 earnings of $0.32 per share, on revenue of $2.98 billion.Â  Analysts polled by Bloomberg were looking for earnings of $0.31 per share on revenue of $3.04 billion. "We reported record fourth quarter operating results which contributed to the best fiscal year performance in our Company's 35-year history,"Â  John Mackey, co-CEO of Whole Foods said in a press release. But the stock is tumbling after the company lowered guidance and missed on revenue. The retailer sees FY14 sales up 11-13%, down from 12-14%. It also sees FY14 comparable store sales of 5.5-7%, below expectations for 6.5-8%. While the earnings report looked "healthy" on the surface level, Brian Sozzi, CEO and chief equities strategist at Belus Capital Advisors, told Business Insider he saw some "unhealthy" signs when he took a closer look.Â  Whole Foods is up over 40% year-to-date.

Reuters In the aftermath of the financial crisis, finance has lost its luster for manyÂ elite MBAs, and a record number of graduates are heading to the white-hot tech sectorÂ instead. According to data assembled by The Wall Street Journal, the percentage of graduates who went into finance dropped by 12% from 2011 to 2013 at Harvard, and by 13% at Stanford. Even Columbia Business School, where more than half of graduates went into finance in 2011, has seen an 8% drop.Â  The share of MBA grads heading to technology jobs is up, and not just in Bay Area schools like Stanford (where it's up 19% over two years), but also at East Coast schools like Harvard, Yale, and Cornell.Â  Because prestige and job growth have shifted away from finance and toward tech, graduates are now more willing to accept lower salaries than they could earn in banking. Â  If you're going to work incredible hours, why not do it at a company people look up to or that you can help grow, rather than in a sector many blame for the financial crisis?Â  In a recent survey, MBAs ranked the companies they considered their ideal employers. Google ranked No. 1, and Apple and Amazon placed in the top five. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs ranked No. 10 and was the only bank even near the top of the list. At the same time, tech companies need finance types, product managers, and other business roles more than ever.Â  The highest-paid employee at Google isn't CEO Larry Page or an engineer, but Chief Business Officer and Northeastern MBA Nikesh Arora.Â  The question is if there are enough jobs for the MBAs now flocking to the tech sector. "I think unfortunately there are a lot of MBAs that have herd mentality, and they just gravitate to what's hot," Curalate founder Apu Gupta told Business Insider earlier this year. "I really hate that because it feels to me like you're just sort of blowing in the wind."
REUTERS/Dominic EbenbichlerAnastasia Savchenko of Russia competes in the women's pole vault final during the IAAF World Athletics Championships at the Luzhniki stadium in Moscow, August 13, 2013.There wasn't a whole lot going on today. Still, stocks rallied, with the Dow hitting new all-time highs. First, the scoreboard: And now the top stories:
David McNew/Getty ImagesThe world's largest online retailer,Â Amazon.comÂ  (NASDAQ:AMZN) , posted great third-quarter results in terms of revenue and user metrics.Â  From a revenue perspective, with $17.09 billion in net sales for the third-quarter, Amazon's business is doing great. Total units sold were up 29%, while third-party units sold increased 33%. In terms of user metrics, Amazon is on its way to becoming a major global hub for online activity, together withÂ FacebookÂ andÂ Google. Active users increased 19%, reaching 224 million. However, the company is barely making money. Although gross margins slightly improved thanks to third-party sales, the company convertedÂ less than 2% of its revenue into operating income. Amazon'sÂ net loss was $41 million in the third quarter,Â or $0.09 per diluted share. Why is Amazon not making a profit? It's all about long-term growthAmazon isn't making profits simply because it is in investment mode. This may sound surprising, considering that 19-year-old Amazon is the world's largest online retailer, not a new start-up. Amazon However, for Amazon's CEO and founder, Jeff Bezos, the company is only at the beginning of a long journey. Few managers have a longer vision than Bezos, who isn't afraid of going beyond retail. Amazon has successfully created a cloud server farm, established its Kindle as a best-selling tablet, entered into the online streaming market with Amazon Prime, and is rumored to be working withÂ HTCÂ on a smartphone. Therefore, although Amazon may be a veteran in the online e-commerce field, it is a start-up in the online streaming market, cloud server business, and educational software segment. This explains why the company spends so much of its revenue. It is investing in every segment that management identifies as having growth potential. Because Amazon is present in many markets, it's normal to see low margins. Remaining competitive in multiple markets requires heavy investment. As Amazon gains market share in new markets, consolidates its position as the standard cloud server choice, and expands its e-commerce business in emerging economies, profitability should improve. Meanwhile, its $166 billion market valuation is safe, as companies are not worth the present value of current cash flows, but the present value of their future cash flows.The curse of being too profitableUsually, investors tend to focus on high profitability when looking for investment opportunities.Â However, in order to protect current high margins, sometimes a very profitable company may avoid entering into low-profit segments that have high future growth potential. This could be a huge mistake in the tech world. With $41.7 billion in net income generated last year,Â AppleÂ  (NASDAQ:Â AAPLÂ Â ) Â became the second most profitable company in the world, according to Forbes. The ability of Apple to sell its devices at a high premium allowed the company to accumulate more than $150 billion in cash and cash equivalents. However, Apple also generated an addiction to high margins. The company maintains an unsustainable premium pricing strategy in an increasingly competitive smartphone world. Furthermore, considering the low end of the smartphone market is expected to grow faster than the high-end segment, Apple's market share is in danger. Future profitability is more importantThe king of retail,Â Wal-MartÂ (NYSE:Â WMTÂ Â ) , made almost $17 billion in profit last year. However, the company faces a strong trade-off relation between keeping its margins at decent levels and pursuing sales growth. In order to keep comparable-store sales growth in the 2% range, the company needs to invest its gross margins to lower prices. Considering there's a heavy and unsustainable reliance on price cuts to attract customers, future profitability remains uncertain. Final Foolish takeawayAmazon's poor profitability is not a problem, as the companyÂ is using most of its revenue to aggressively invest in new products. It is investing in warehouses and data centers. It is selling its Kindle fire at cost price, and giving one-year free Amazon Web Services subscriptions to developers. Amazon is investing for the future.

Jonathan BalesA handful of daily fantasy “sharks” setting lineups in the early morning hours of a trip to Las Vegas A handful of daily fantasy “sharks” setting lineups in the early morning hours of a trip to Las Vegas.I’ve had a couple back-to-back five-figure weeks. I’ve been a contrarian lately and I was pretty bullish on some underperforming guys, so I had a lot of exposure to a few values that ended up working out in my favor.” Those are the words of Peter Jennings, a Colorado native who used to make his living as a stock trader. He still practices the trader lingo, but these days, Peter is buying and selling stocks of a different sort—professional athletes. Peter is one of a handful of individuals making a living in the daily fantasy sports industry. The concept is simple: working within the confines of a salary cap, users build a team of players, all of whom have “salaries” set by particular fantasy sites, and accumulate points as they play in real games. Unlike traditional season-long fantasy sports leagues, though, most daily fantasy sports leagues end in less than 24 hours. Competing against others in real cash games—a legal endeavor since the United States government astutely considers fantasy sports a game of skill—one can put as much or as little time into the games as they’d like. Most newcomers to the daily fantasy sites fill out lineups in a matter of minutes and hope for the best. Others spend countless hours creating projections, tweaking models, watching film, and constructing lineups. And for Peter and others like him—the industry’s elite players known as “sharks”—the end result is quite lucrative. In the daily fantasy sports world, Peter is the prototype. Affectionately known by his fantasy sports username “CSURAM88” within the fantasy sports community, Peter once made a living playing poker professionally. When the poker industry collapsed, he worked his way into trading before setting his sights on what he considers the best investment opportunity available right now. “I pretty much knew I wanted to get out of stock trading and into daily fantasy sports right away. I was set to make that move as a player when StarStreet.com (a daily fantasy sports site) asked me to come work for them. And when I won the FFFC in late-2012, it was a nice little incentive to make me feel like I made the right decision.” The “FFFC” is the championship tournament hosted by FanDuel—the industry’s largest site—and their “nice little incentive” was a $150,000 grand prize. Competing against 23 others in Las Vegas, Peter won daily fantasy sports’ largest single payout in a matter of hours on a single Sunday. He qualified at a buy-in level of just $10. When you’re competing against thousands of other players in a single tournament, part of the outcome—perhaps even most of it—is controlled by luck. But by shifting the odds in their favor, Peter and the other sharks can continually dominate a game that, like poker, is heavily influenced by randomness. “There’s lots of variance, obviously,” Peter told me, “but I’m usually profitable around 75 percent of weeks in NFL. And football is the most difficult sport just because the typical user knows so much, so it’s a lot easier to profit in NBA or MLB.” And how does this poker player turned stock trader turned daily fantasy sports guru shift the percentages in his favor? “It’s like any investment, really. You’re basically just looking to find value where players’ salaries are too low relative to their expected production. So obviously there’s a lot of math involved with that. I use the Vegas lines a lot in my projections, so that’s a really big part of my models.” All of the work—think two full-time jobs worth of it—is paying off. RotoGrinders.com—a site dedicated solely to daily fantasy sports analysis—currently has Peter ranked as the 10th-best player in the world, including No. 7 in NFL and No. 4 in NBA. Peter isn’t the only one transitioning from “the real world” to daily fantasy sports. “TommyG1979”—one of the premiere MLB players in daily fantasy—also works as a trader and “trading mentor.” Raking in a salary well into the six figures, Tommy G. is prepared to give up the sure thing for what he considers the opportunity of a lifetime, despite reservations from anyone and everyone around him who isn’t involved with daily fantasy sports. Despite his statistical background and early accomplishments playing daily fantasy sports, Tommy’s goal isn’t just to make it as a player. “I’ll always play daily fantasy, but my ultimate goal is to take over the industry from the broadcasting perspective. This thing is going to explode, and I want to be the face of fantasy sports. In my current career, my ceiling is pretty much capped. But I don’t think that’s the case with daily fantasy sports.” Tommy isn’t your typical fantasy sports nerd. Although still a self-proclaimed “stat geek,” he’s also a “former guido”—Bill James meets The Situation. And that dynamic is what Tommy believes can revolutionize daily fantasy sports. “I have a job that pays well and allows me to travel all over the world, but it’s not what I’m passionate about. We didn’t have a lot of money when I was growing up, so I just wanted to find a job that could get me rich. But that’s not really satisfying.” In reference to his timeline for making the switch, Tommy hints it could be right around the corner. “It was originally going to be the end of next year, but the way things are moving right now, it could be a matter of months. Two months, man.” And what about that high six-figure salary? “I’m not really worried about it. The pay will sort itself out. I’m just going to keep plugging away, not force it, and figure out a way to make money doing something I love.” It’s one thing to depart a well-paying job after saving money to follow your dream. It’s another altogether to begin your career as a daily fantasy sports player fresh out of college. But that’s one path that Michael McClure, known online as “Mike5754”, is strongly considering. Michael, in his early-20s, attends Kansas State University. The senior mechanical engineering major already has job offers while in college—offers that might never get accepted. And how does Michael find time for daily fantasy research while still maintaining a high GPA in perhaps the university’s most challenging major? “I go to the library between all of my classes. I download all of the salary data and start making projections. I enter most of the projections by hand right now, but I’m working on some models that could really cut down on that.” Michael has swiftly ascended the daily fantasy rankings. “I began by playing just a couple dollars a night. Really small stuff. And then I started winning more and playing more. I still play really conservatively when you consider my bankroll.” I asked Michael how conservatively he plays, thinking he might occasionally enter leagues with a triple-digit buy-in. “I play some heads-up for $1,000 now, but everything I do has a mathematical objective. I play a certain percentage each night, selecting my lineups and leagues to optimize my profitability. It’s kind of like a part-time investment job right now.” Even with his achievements in the daily fantasy world, Michael seems to be leaning toward the traditional career path to start. “I think I’ll end up accepting a job so that I can save up money to play more daily fantasy. So I’ll probably do that for a year or two and then reassess what I want to do. I think that’s what I’ll do, anyway.” Sounding a bit unsure, I asked Michael how confident he was in that decision. “Well, we’ll see how this NBA season goes.” Jonathan BalesStarStreet’s 2012 PFBC third place winner with his bevy of beauties, including Pilar Lastra (second from left).A poker player, a trader, and a chemical engineering major. Notice any similarities? But believe it or not, not everyone involved in the daily fantasy sports industry is obsessed with mathematical models. Actually, it’s a model of a different type who has really flipped the fantasy nerd stereotype on its head. Pilar Lastra is a former Playboy Playmate of the Month and one of People magazine’s “100 Most Beautiful People” for her work as a model on the television show Deal or No Deal. Not exactly your typical nerd. And Pilar’s not only involved with the media side of fantasy sports. She’s a player, too. Within five minutes of talking to her, Pilar expressed her dissatisfaction with one of her sleeper picks. “Can you believe Davone Bess? I had him in a lot of lineups because Brian Hoyer is starting for Cleveland. They just traded away Richardson, so you’d think they’d want to use the short passing game a lot with the new quarterback. And Bess should have been pretty safe since he’s not dependent on big plays for production.” Pilar is used to giving fantasy advice as Miller Lite’s fantasy expert and the host of “Every Man’s Fantasy” on Sirius XM. But she didn’t become heavily focused on daily fantasy sports until daily fantasy sports came to her. “I was at the Playboy Mansion for StarStreet’s Playboy Baseball Championship. They flew out 40 players for their championship party. Honestly, the other girls and I all thought it was kind of going to be lame just because of the preconceptions we had about fantasy sports dorks. It was honestly probably the best party we’ve ever had there.” With $200,000 on the line, no one even seemed to care all that much about the games being played on the big screens. “There’s never been a Playboy party like that. There was all this money on the line, but people were playing beer pong games for $1,000 and doing backflips off of the grotto into the pool. It was awesome. And that’s where I met all of the guys—Peter and Jeremy Levine, the founder of StarStreet, and Tommy and Michael, who both won tickets into the championship. They introduced me more to the daily side of fantasy sports and I’ve just been hooked ever since.” The daily fantasy industry has grown considerably in recent years, but those involved in it think we haven’t seen anything yet. That’s an incredible, even seemingly inconceivable thought considering that, by the end of 2013, three people will instantly be made millionaires from daily fantasy sports. When Peter Jennings took down FanDuel’s $150,000 prize in 2012, it was the largest single cash in daily fantasy history. Fast-forward just 12 months, and three sites—FanDuel, DraftKings, and DraftStreet—will each be dishing out a $1 million prize that’s over six times anything we’ve ever seen. Chances are those winners will have entered for $25 or less. But despite the exorbitant prizes and the unfathomable salaries being earned by some of the top professionals like Peter, the most obvious sign that daily fantasy sports are on the verge of reaching that coveted “tipping point” is the diversity of the sites’ users. “I noticed Saints running back Pierre Thomas plays on StarStreet,” Jeremy told me. “He doesn’t have any deal with us or anything; he just likes to play. He had one of the highest scores on the site in his first week.” From the former poker pros and stock traders to the mechanical engineering majors to the Playboy playmates to professional athletes, everyone seems to be jumping head-first into the daily fantasy sports craze. “We’re going to be on TV soon,” Tommy said. “This is really going to be the next poker boom, so it’s a great time to get involved.” “I’m just so bullish on the industry in general,” Peter added. “I love the direction it’s headed. There are so many different types of players now and it’s still growing exponentially.” On a recent Monday morning, I got a call from my father saying he had something important to tell me about my grandfather. Fearing the worst, I hesitantly asked what was wrong. “He started playing daily fantasy sports this weekend,” my dad replied matter-of-factly. “He never played any type of fantasy sports before.” “Oh wow, how much did he lose so far?” “He made $400 last night.”
In January(ish), PBS' investigative documentary series "Frontline" will air its special on SAC Capital, the once high-powered hedge fund that Friday agreed to plead guilty to insider trading and pay a $1.8 billion fine. SAC, which will now have to close its doors to outside investors, is headed by legendary trader Steve Cohen. According to the Feds, he's guilty of fostering a "culture of corporate corruption" and failing to supervise his traders as they used inside information to make incredible returns. Now "Frontline" has released video that it obtained during the making of its documentary â€” video that shows that Cohen may not have been totally clear on what "inside information" meant on Wall Street. Or at least, it seems like he doesn't understand it in a hypothetical situation lawyers gave him during his deposition. There's more video of Cohen saying that he relies on his council and hasn't read the "vague" rules on insider trading over at "Frontline." 
Eric Gaillard/ReutersTwitter has done everything in its power to be the anti-Facebook, as far as its IPO is concerned. And so on ...  Yet, the end result could end up being somewhat similar for Twitter.  Charlie Gasparino just tweeted that Twitter wants to see the stock open at $40 a share tomorrow when it starts trading. He says a source tells him there is concern the stock will shoot to $80 thanks to strong demand.  The strong demand for Twitter's stock could be so overwhelming that the opening will be delayed as the NYSE tries to handle the load. It might not start trading until the afternoon, says Gasparino. If this happens, and it's all a big if, then it's going to be a crazy mess.

Volatility always signals a change in leadership within the equity markets. The growth stories going into a period of volatility are rarely the growth stories afterward. 2008â€™s bear market has so far mirrored that historical precedent. Prior to 2008, credit-related asset classes outperformed traditional US stocks as the global credit bubble inflated. Since 2008, however, credit-related asset classes, including emerging markets, have underperformed traditional US stocks (see Chart 1). Richard Bernstein Itâ€™s profits growth not economic growth that mattersOur analyses through the years have clearly demonstrated that stock market performance is more closely tied to profits cycles than to economic cycles. Markets care more about corporate profits than about GDP, but most emerging market investors nonetheless focus on GDP growth. Investorsâ€™ expectations of profits growth, both cyclically and secularly, for the emerging markets, have consistently been too optimistic. The profits outlook in the emerging markets is actually poor and appears to be deteriorating further. The majority of emerging market companies has been reporting negative earnings surprises for more than a year. Chart 2 shows the proportion of emerging market companies that have reported negative earnings surprises versus the same tally for S&amp;P 500 companies. Whereas about 25-30% of US companies have been reporting negative earnings surprises during the past year, about 55-60% of EM companies have reported negative surprises. Â Richard Bernstein These statistics are even more powerful when compared to other regionsâ€™ negative earnings surprises. Chart 3 shows the proportion during the past two quarters of each regionâ€™s companies that have reported negative earnings surprises. Note that EM is among the worst. The consistent trend of negative earnings surprises suggests to us that investors refuse to believe that the global economy is changing. Analysts refuse to significantly alter their growth projections because they apparently believe that the problems in the emerging markets are only temporary. Richard Bernstein The US is a better growth story...Because analysts generally believe that the problems in the emerging markets are temporary, long-term growth projections have been similarly downward-sticky. However, even despite that hesitancy to accept that emerging market companiesâ€™ profits growth is changing, EM companiesâ€™ long-term growth projections are not superior. Chart 4 shows bottom-up, long-term earnings growth projections by region. Contrary to what many might assert, the emerging markets are not the worldâ€™s best growth story. As we have pointed out many times, US small cap companies offer superior growth to that offered by the emerging markets. The US is now a better growth story than are the emerging markets!! Richard Bernstein ...but no one believes it.Mutual fund flows suggest that investors still do not believe the US growth story. Rather, they continue to invest heavily in emerging market equities as shown on Chart 5. To us, this seems very similar to the early-2000s when investors were waiting for technology shares to lead the market, and ignored the opportunities in emerging markets, gold, commodities, real estate, etc. Richard Bernstein Our bullishness regarding US equities has lasted for more than four years, and we see little to dissuade us from our current position. Admittedly, equities are not as attractive as they were four years ago, but the standard warning signs that typically suggest a higher probability of a bear market are nowhere to be seen. Weâ€™ll likely change our tune when the yield curve inverts, when investors are certain and valuations are rich, or when US equities are widely considered to be core holdings. None of those characteristics are true today in the US. In the emerging markets, however, inflation is high and some yield curves are inverted or close to inverting. Valuations seem quite rich to us when one takes into account these countriesâ€™ inflation rates. Fund flows suggest that investors still consider emerging markets the worldâ€™s best growth story. Itâ€™s that last point we are particularly worried about. Emerging markets are the growth story that isnâ€™t.
Harvard University has produced nearly twice as many billionaire alumni as any other institution of higher education, according to the 2013 Billionaire Census from Wealth-X and UBS. Its 52 billionaire alumni are worth $205 billion, compared to second-place University of Pennsylvania's 28 billionaire graduates, who together are worth $112 billion. The University of Cambridge was the only non-U.S. university to break into the top 10, with 11 billionaire alumni. According to Wealth-X and UBS, 68% of billionaires have at least a bachelor's degree. In comparison, 86% of ultra-high-net-worth individuals (those with a net worth of $30 million or more) have a bachelor's degree or higher. "These figures suggest that while Â education may help a person become a Â UHNW individual, it is not a prerequisite Â to then go on and amass a billion dollar fortune," the report concluded. Here are the 10 universities with the most billionaire alumni: Wealth-X and UBS Billionaire Census
On Tuesday, I had my first chance to get behind the wheel of the Tesla Model S. A few hours after my drive, the automaker issued a less than perfect earnings report, driving its stock down more than 12%. I couldn't care less about what the stock does. It doesn't matter. As long as Tesla keeps making cars this amazing, it will succeed, because lots of people a) want the best car on the market, and b) can afford it. The best part of my job is that I get to drive all sorts of excellent new cars. Regrettably, I've become a bit jaded. It takes nicer features and more horsepower to impress me than it did when I started out. But when traffic finally moved out of my way on the West Side Highway and I hit the pedal on the Model S, the acceleration knocked an involuntary smile onto my face. It was a short drive, but thrilling. The car I tested came with the P85 battery pack, the most powerful available. It had basically every option you can order, for a total price of $108,770 (before a $7,500 federal tax credit). The Model S is silent and comfortable in traffic. It's a beast on the open road. It seats seven. It looks great, inside and out (though it could use cup holders in the backseat). The massive center console screen, while not quite on par with the iPad and possibly distracting, may be the best of its kind in the auto industry today. The car is safe, scoring top marks from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). It can catch on fire if you crash it through a concrete wall and into a tree, but the driver in Mexico who did that walked away without serious injury. I'm not alone in my praise. Consumer Reports called the Model S the best car it has ever tested. Motor Trend, Automobile Magazine, and Yahoo! Autos named it the car of the year in 2012. I've never met an auto journalist who didn't love driving it. I have heard only two real criticisms of the Model S. Let's address them.Â  There's no doubt about it, the Model S is a luxury car. Elon Musk promises to build an "affordable" $35,000 car in a few years. I hope he does. But that doesn't impact the Model S. Its base price ranges from $62,500 to $83,570 (after a $7,500 federal tax credit), so it's not a car everyone can buy. Not everyone can afford cars from Mercedes-Benz or BMW, either. That doesn't mean those automakers aren't successful. It's expensive, but worth every penny. It's true, you can't just hop in the Model S and drive across the country, or even from Boston to Washington, D.C. Tesla's supercharger stations take half an hour to recharge a battery, still less convenient than filling a gas tank in a few minutes. For the foreseeable future, limited range will be an issue for electric cars. But when I look at all the upsides of the electric sedan, it's a small sacrifice. If you really need to drive from LA to New York, rent a car. You can pay for it with the money you'll save on gas (filling up the battery at a supercharger station is free for Tesla owners, forever). Tesla has built a car that is more innovative and exciting than anything I've ever driven. The price is high but totally fair. Forget the ups and downs of the stock market: If a company builds something this good and is competently run (and it is), it will succeed.
I often receive questions on which color shoes to wear with which color pants. None of the questions are bad questions; sometimes it is hard to tell if things work together. So I have decided to make a chart to try to help all of us out. I hope the chart is easy to understand. On the left we have the pant color and the right, the shoe color. If you can wear a given color of shoe with a color of pants, the color is present. If you cannot, ‘NO’ will be present. The Fine Young Gentlemen  Now, obviously, there are exceptions to everything. Sometimes certain shades of burgundy won’t go with burgundy pants, or the grays and browns just won’t mix. So this is only to act as a general guide and not as law, for it is mostly a subjective view on what I have seen done well and not well over the past few years. I should note that some of you may disagree with some of the approved and not approved combinations, such as my lack of support for tan pants and black shoes. Disagree all you want, but I don’t think I’ve ever seen the pairing done well. Anyway, you should get the idea by now. Justin Jeffers is the editor of The Fine Young Gentleman -- a blog on mens style founded on the belief that men can and should dress better.  He was previously an auditor at one of the Big Four in New York City. 
Since May, when market participants caught wind that the Federal Reserve was seriously contemplating tapering down its quantitative easing program sometime in the (perhaps near) future, the bond market has been a little more volatile than usual. Over the summer, a lot of ideas were thrown around on Wall Street about how the Fed could pull this off without completely spooking the market. One of them was that it could lower the 6.5% unemployment rate threshold (introduced at its December 2012 meeting) for considering hiking short-term interest rates. Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius suggested it in early August. "We still expect Fed officials to taper QE at the September 17-18 FOMC meeting, but to offset the impact on financial conditions by reinforcing the forward guidance for the funds rate," said Hatzius in a note. "There are two broad possibilities for how this might happen. First, they could simply lower the 6.5% unemployment threshold." A new paper authored by economists at the New York Fed now has Hatzius predicting that the FOMC will do just that at its March FOMC meeting. "It is hard to overstate the importance of two new Fed staff studies that will be presented at the IMF's annual research conference on November 7-8," says Hatzius. "Our baseline view is now that the FOMC will reduce its 6.5% threshold to 6% at the March 2014 FOMC meeting, alongside the first tapering of QE. A move as early as the December 2013 meeting is possible, and if so, this might also increase the probability of an earlier tapering of QE." The paper discusses an "optimal control" approach to monetary policy — one that suggests lower rates for longer as the Fed shifts its focus to fighting above-target unemployment, as long as unemployment remains further from its target than inflation, which currently does not appear to be a threat. This just so happens to be an approach that incoming Fed chairman Janet Yellen has mentioned in recent speeches, and one that many expect may become the hallmark of the new Yellen Fed. Connect the dots, and you have an interesting coincidence. In a note to clients, however, BofA Merrill Lynch economist Ethan Harris asserts emphatically that this paper, contrary to popular opinion, is not some sort of policy signal meant to prime markets for the end of QE. To begin with, Harris points out the biggest problem with optimal control: it makes sense in theory, but is very hard to implement in practice, as it it heavily reliant on models with hundreds of inputs. Yellen herself acknowledged this on the occasions that she spoke about it. Harris does believe they will eventually lower the unemployment threshold, but they won't do it when they taper down QE. Harris writes: One popular view is that the Fed will change its forward guidance at the same meeting of the first tapering of asset purchases. This would minimize any shock to the market from tapering. While this is possible, we see four reasons for the Fed to separate these decisions. First, they have already repeatedly explained that 6.5% is a very rough (and increasingly flawed) guidepost. Second, they don't want to put even more focus on the unemployment guidepost by micromanaging it. Third, moving the two levers simultaneously seems a bit too clever for the straight shooting Bernanke bank. Recall that some forecasters also expected this double switch at the September meeting. Finally, the Fed is in uncharted territory and with each move, it tries to learn about how its exit tools work. If they move both levers at the same time they undercut this learning process. So, that's his case for why lowering the unemployment threshold and tapering QE won't happen at the same time. But he doesn't stop there — he is really emphatic that the paper is not a policy signal: One final point: the recent discussion of the English paper holds lessons for how the Fed communicates. While the paper adds to the case for extending forward guidance, it should not be viewed as a "signal" of Fed policy. Under Greenspan, Fed watching was like a game of “Where’s Waldo?” with coded signals buried deep in speeches. Under Bernanke, Waldo has a large bullseye on his back: any important message from the Fed is in the directive, the press conference, the minutes, and the quarterly FOMC forecasts. A research paper, even authored by senior Fed economists, is not the way the Fed is going to signal a major policy change. Bernanke and/or Yellen did not pop into English’s office and say: "Bill, could you and your colleagues do this 70 page paper that will signal to the rest of the FOMC and the general public a possible shift in policy guidance? No rush, we are not making policy changes at the September FOMC meeting, but we do need it done before the December FOMC meeting. I’ve called up the IMF to make sure their annual conference is timed right for you to signal a policy change." The paper is a small window into the evolving policy discussion at the Fed. While the Fed may eventually head in this direction, it's probably not imminent. Click here to read more about "optimal control" and how it works »
The company existed for almost 200 years from its founding in 1602, when the States-General of the Netherlands granted it a 21-year monopoly over Dutch operations in Asia until its demise in 1796.Â  During those two centuries, the VOC sent almost a million people to Asia, more than the rest of Europe combined.Â  It commanded almost 5000 ships and enjoyed huge profits from its spice trade. The VOC was larger than some countries. In part, because of the VOC, Amsterdam was the financial center of capitalism for two centuries. Not only did the VOC transform the world, but it transformed financial markets as well. The foundations of the VOC were laid when the Dutch began to challenge the Portuguese monopoly in East Asia in the 1590s. These ventures were quite successful.Â  Some ships returned a 400% profit, and investors wanted more.Â  Before the establishment of the VOC in 1602, individual ships were funded by merchants as limited partnerships that ceased to exist when the ships returned.Â  Merchants would invest in several ships at a time so that if one failed to return, they werenâ€™t wiped out. The establishment of the VOC allowed hundreds of ships to be funded simultaneously by hundreds of investors to minimize risk. The English founded the East India Company in 1600, and the Dutch followed in 1602 by founding the Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie. The charter of the new company empowered it to build forts, maintain armies, and conclude treaties with Asian rulers. The VOC was the original military-industrial complex. The VOC quickly spread throughout Asia. Not only did the VOC establish itself in Jakarta and the rest of the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), but it established itself near Japan, being the only foreign company allowed to trade there, along the Malabar Cost in India, removing the Portuguese, in Sri Lanka, at the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, and throughout Asia.Â  The company was highly successful until the 1670s when the VOC lost their post in Taiwan, and faced more competition from the English and other colonial powers. Profits continued, but the VOC had to switch to traded goods with lower margins, but they were able to do this because interest rates had fallen during the 1600s.Â  Jean-Paul Rodrigue, Professor, Hofstra University Lower interest rates enabled the VOC to finance more trade through debt. The company paid high dividends, sometimes funded by borrowing, which reduced the amount of capital reinvested.Â  Given the high level of overhead it took to maintain the VOC outposts throughout Asia, the borrowing and lack of capital ultimately undermined the VOC. Nevertheless, until the 1780s, the VOC remained a huge multinational corporation that stretched throughout Asia. The Fourth Anglo-Dutch War of 1780-1784 left the company a financial wreck.Â  The French Revolution began in 1789, leading to the occupation of Amsterdam in 1795. The VOC was nationalized on March 1, 1796 by the new Batavian Republic, and its charter was allowed to expire on December 31, 1799.Â  Most of the VOCâ€™s Asian possessions were ceded to the British after the Napoleonic Wars were finished, and the English East India Company took over the VOCâ€™s infrastructure. The VOC transformed financial capitalism forever in ways few people understand. Although shares had been issued in corporations before the VOC was founded, the VOC introduced limited liability for its shareholders which enabled the firm to fund large scale operations. Limited liability was needed since the collapse of the company would have destroyed even the largest investor in the company, much less the smaller investors.Â  Although this innovation changed capitalism forever, there were ways in which the VOC failed to transform itself, which led to its downfall.Â  The companyâ€™s capital remained virtually the same during its 200 year existence, staying around 6.4 million florins (about $2.3 million).Â  Instead of issuing new shares to raise additional capital, the company relied on reinvested capital.Â  The VOCâ€™s dividend policy left little capital for reinvestment, so the company turned to debt.Â Â  The company first issued debt in the 1630s, increasing its debt/equity ratio to two.Â  The ratio stayed at two until the 1730s, rising to around four in the 1760s, then increased dramatically in the 1780s to around 18, ultimately bankrupting the company, and leading to its nationalization and demise. In the 1600s and 1700s, the Dutch had the lowest cost of capital in the world.Â  This was because of an innovative idea: if you pay back your loans, your creditors will reward you with a lower interest rate.Â  This wasnâ€™t the way Spain, France, and other kings looked at borrowing money, and their interest rates remained high.Â  As a result of Dutch fiscal rectitude, the yield on Dutch government bonds fell from 20% in 1517 to 8.5% by 1600 and to 4% by 1700.Â  Not only did the Dutch have the lowest interest rates in the world at that time, but they had the lowest interest rates in history. This pushed the Dutch to invest not only in joint-stock companies, such as the VOC, but in foreign government debt, helping to fund the American Revolution. Another interesting aspect of the VOC was its dividend policy.Â  Some of the dividends were paid in kind, rather than in money, and the dividends varied widely.Â  The company paid dividends of 15% of capital in 1605, 75% in 1606, 40% in 1607, 20% in 1608, 25% in 1609 in money, then an average of 71% in produce for the next seven years, the next 5 years in money at 19%, the next three years in cloves at 41%, 44% in spices in 1638, in 1640 two dividends of 20% each, 5% in money and 15% in cloves, 1641, 40% in cloves, 1642, 50% in money, 1643, 15% in cloves, from 1644 to 1672, an average of 21.25% per annum, all but one paid in money, in 1673, bonds for 33.5% were given, payable by the province of Holland, from 1676 to 1682, 4% bonds averaging 19.5% of par per year, from 1683 to 1689, money averaging 20%, from 1690 to 1698, bonds paying 3.5% payable in 1740 on average of 21.875% per annum, from 1698 to 1728, money was paid, averaging 28.125% per annum.Â  The dividend averaged around 18% of capital over the course of the company's 200-year existence, but no dividends were paid after 1782. The VOC provided a high return to investors, but not always in the way shareholders wanted.Â  The VOC basically unloaded their inventories on shareholders in some years, providing them with produce, cloves, spices or bonds.Â  Some shareholders refused to accept them. Obviously, shareholders want money, not goods, and the three British companies, Bank of England, East India Company and South Sea Company, learned from this and only paid cash dividends during the 1700s.Â  The average dividends of 20-30% of capital were high, but since the price of shares traded around 400 during most of the companyâ€™s existence, as the chart below shows,Â  the actual dividend yield was around 5-7%, better than Dutch bonds, but less than bonds from â€œemerging marketâ€ countries, such as Russia or Sweden. Global Financial Data As the chart shows, shares started at 100 in 1602, moved up to 200 by 1607, suffered a bear raid in 1609, moved up to the 400 range in the 1630s, fluctuated as the fortune of the company changed from year to year, participated in the bubble of the 1720s when shares exceeded 1000, fell back to 600, rallied to 800 in the1730s, then slowly declined from there.Â  Perhaps, no better indicator of the Dutch economy, or the global economy, prior to 1800 exists. The VOC also transformed the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, causing a number of innovations to be introduced, such as futures contracts, options, short selling, and even the first bear raid. Isaac le Maire was the largest shareholder of the VOC in its early years, and he initiated the first bear raid in stock history, selling shares of VOC short in order to buy them back at a profit and buy additional shares. These actions also led to the first government regulation of stock markets, attempting to ban short selling in 1621, 1623, 1624, 1630 and 1632 as well as options and other forms of financial wizardry.Â  The fact that these laws had to be passed so many times shows the regulations were not that effective. One problem for the long-term success of the Amsterdam Stock Exchange was that the VOC and the West Indies Company (WIC) were the only shares of importance that traded on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange. Between 1600 and 1800, no new large companies listed in Amsterdam.Â  Although Dutch fiscal rectitude kept debt and interest rates low, it also helped stifle the growth of the Amsterdam Stock Exchange because government bonds never became a prominent part of the trading on the exchange. Due to the decentralized political nature of the Netherlands, government debt was held locally.Â  There was no centralized national debt as in France and England, and ultimately, this inhibited the growth of the Amsterdam Stock Exchange.Â  The Netherlands was as decentralized as France was centralized.Â Â  Because the VOC and WIC so dominated the share market, the company didnâ€™t issue new shares to raise capital, and Dutch debt was so small and diversified among its cities, that the Dutch invested in foreign debt to find an outlet for their capital. Dutch newspapers of the 1700s often list the prices of French debt in Paris as well as British Consols, Bank of England Stock, British East India Company and South Sea Company stock in London, but no other debt or equity from Amsterdam is listed.Â  With the exception of colonial trade, until the 1800s no capitalist enterprise required the levels of capital of the VOC and WIC. So the Dutch capital that was available went into debt, not equity. America went to Amsterdam to raise capital, as did Sweden, France, England, Russia, Saxony, Denmark, Austria and other countries. This provided Dutch investors with higher returns, but didnâ€™t develop the Dutch economy in the way it could have. Another factor that may have held the Amsterdam Exchange from expanding was the fact that shares could only be registered on a monthly or quarterly basis. The situation was different in London. Not only could British shares and debt be registered daily, but all of the shares were available for transfer.Â  On the other hand, many VOC shares werenâ€™t traded at all. The amount of British and French debt grew throughout the 1600s and 1700s, requiring new investors on a regular basis. Not only did the VOCâ€™s capital remain constant, but centralized Dutch government debt didnâ€™t exist until the Netherlands became a kingdom under Napoleon. Amsterdam failed to provide its investors new opportunities. Before the Industrial Revolution, companies were simply too small to require sufficient capital to be traded on exchanges.Â  Shipping had long been a high-risk venture, providing high returns and high losses, and investors diversified their risk by putting their money in a number of different ships.Â  The colonial trading companies of the 1600s and 1700s took financial capital to a different level, allowing thousands of people to invest in thousands of shipping ventures and diversifying risk. After the Napoleonic Wars, the center of global finance shifted from Amsterdam to London. Although this process was spread out over several decades, it is amazing that the center of global finance could so easily switch from Amsterdam to London so quickly and easily.Â  There were some things, mostly political, which Amsterdam had little control over, such as the Napoleonic Wars, their occupation by the French, and the loss of its colonies after the war. In retrospect, there were things the Dutch could have done to increase the likelihood that Amsterdam would have stayed at the center of global finance after 1815, though they probably could not have foreseen that the center would shift to London.Â  The Dutch failed to diversify away from VOC and WIC shares and allow other companies to take advantage of capital markets; they failed to sufficiently develop the bond side of the market because was no centralized government debt; they failed to expand the capital of the VOC, but instead chose to borrow, adding to the debt load which led to the bankruptcy of the VOC and WIC; the VOC and WIC did not sufficiently reinvest dividends for growth, and they failed to offer a large number of securities that would encourage trading as in London. The company failed to raise additional capital when necessary, to limit borrowing, or to fund capital expenditures through cutting its dividend.Â  Since the Netherlands lacked a centralized debt issuer, as the French, British and Russians did, the Amsterdam Stock Exchange faded in importance after the VOC and WIC collapsed. Foreign government bonds became more prominent in Amsterdam, but even the foreign government bond trading moved to London in the 1820s where capital was more readily available. It is doubtful whether Amsterdam could have foreseen all the changes that happened, and perhaps they couldnâ€™t have prevented the switch from Amsterdam to London that occurred after 1815, but it was a lesson London should have learned.Â  London became the engine of global capitalism for the nineteenth century, only to lose its place to New York after World War I.Â  The US should understand this lesson as well.Â  The global center of finance must grow, innovate and be as open as possible. Otherwise, the center will move to someplace that is.
There's not a lot a company can do to stop Muddy Waters once the short-selling firm has targeted it. It can write 90 page defense reports, the CEO can get on Bloomberg TV and explain himself, the company can hold conference calls. Doesn't matter. As Muddy Waters' crusade against its latest target, Chinese company NQ Mobile has shown, the short selling firm will keep on it, and eventually, the firm will even start having fun with it. At least that's what it seems like. The title firm's latest report on NQ is downright trolly â€” 'If You Believe in Yidatong, You'll Believe in Santa Claus (NYSE: NQ)' Muddy Waters has called NQ a "massive fraud" that essentially makes up all its revenue. Yidatong is NQ's main source of revenue. At least, according to the company. Not so, according to Muddy's latest report: NQâ€™s largest purported source of revenue, Yidatong (â€œYDTâ€), is controlled by NQ, and its primary purpose is facilitating NQâ€™s fraud. Believing NQâ€™s narrative of YDT â€“ that YDT is an independent company annually facilitating billing of approximately $35 million for a variety of developers â€“ at this point requires investors to suspend reason. If the following does not convince an investor that NQâ€™s YDT narrative is fabricated, then the investor is either too emotionally invested in the stock, or is gullible enough to still believe in Santa Claus. To whoever wrote that report headline, maybe consider blogging?
The world's billionaire population continues to grow, as does their total wealth. According to a new Billionaire Census by Wealth-X and UBS, the number of billionaires around the globe grew .5% between July 2012 and June 2013, and their cumulative wealth increased by 5.3%. But that growth has not been evenly distributed. Billionaire wealth in Asia grew 13% in that time period, the fastest of any region. It also added 18 billionaires in the past year, more than any other region. Europe, on the other hand, lost 29 billionaires, although the total net worth of the region's 766 billionaires increased 3.7%, according to the report. The map below shows total wealth change for billionaires by region between July 2012 and June 2013.

Five months ago Longboard Capital Management called Tesla the new Apple, and predicted it would go up to $200/ share from it's then level of $55/share.Â  Now things are looking a little different, according to Longboard's CEO Cole Wilcox. Tesla stock has tanked 16% after the electric vehicle maker reported losses of $0.32 per share in its earnings last night, worse than analysts expected loss of $0.25 per share.Â  Wilcox now believes that there is nowhere for the stock to go but down.Â  In an interview with CNBC, Wilcox says that while Tesla has been the top pick for momentum players this year, they cannot expect the momentum to continue next year. "The short side isÂ the way to play the trade next year. 2014 is the year of theÂ honeymoon ending for Tesla shareholders andÂ ultimately people will be veryÂ disappointed as the economicÂ reality of the company doesn'tÂ catch up where the momentum isÂ at today," he says.Â  "Ultimately, I think we're inÂ for a wild ride to the downsideÂ as we go forward in the future." James Albertine of Stifel Equity Research agrees with him, adding that Tesla's massive capex is going to catch up with its cash balances next quarter.  "Our question remains in 2014,Â what's the extent of the cashÂ burn?Â It's [going to be in] infrastructure build out,Â retail buildout, building toÂ a European and globalÂ audience that has right handÂ as well as left-hand drive."Â  Watch the full segment below: 
It may be counterintuitive, but walking might be worse for the environment than driving. That's the conclusion Richard B. Mckenzie, a professor of Economics at the Paul Merage School of Business comes to in his blog post on EconLib. Because of the way food supply chains work, walking a mile â€” and consequently expending calories that need to be replaced â€” might actually be more wasteful and polluting than driving a mile. He takes the example of a 180 pound man who chooses to walk a mile to work instead of driving. Walking a mile will burn 200 calories more than the 2000 calories he burns just to survive. Producing food worth 200 calories takes up to 3000-4000 calories. So a person that drives a high fuel economy car that burns 40 miles per gallon will be using only a half to two-thirds of the energy than the walker uses in replacing the calories he expended on walks.Â  The heavier you get, the less efficient walking is, as a heavier person would burn more calories from walking a mile. So walking can be 1.5 to 2 times more polluting than driving a high mileage car. Â  The reason for this is the way the food supply chain in the US is structured. McKenzie provides a breakdown of how the farm sector uses energy: Â  "Many categories of farm equipmentâ€”such as tractors, mowers, trucks, cars, balers, and combinesâ€”can be as gas-guzzling and polluting as the eighteen-wheelers on the nation's highways. Farms use a lot of electricityâ€”generated by distant and often coal-burning power plantsâ€”to run irrigation equipment and heating/cooling systems for cattle barns, pig or poultry pens, and animal waste disposal plants. The nation's entire food industryâ€”ranging from the production of fertilizer and pesticides to crops and livestock to food processing, packaging, and transportation and then on to food preparation by consumersâ€”uses nearly a fifth of the fossil energy burned annually in the United States. Field hands who actually pick crops hunched over rows need to eat extra-large energy-dense meals to replace the 5,000 (or more) calories they can burn daily, and the calories they down are also produced in energy-intensive ways. A major input in agriculture is natural gas, and the cost of natural gas can be as much as 90 percent of the total production cost of fertilizers and pesticides." In addition to these, harvesting beef not only uses more energy as the animals need to be fed, but it also produces polluting gases like methane from the cows themselves.Â Once the food is produced, its conversion to energy in humans is also pretty inefficient. The amount of energy food produces is only about 13.5% of the energy used in its production. That's less efficient than most cars. Electric cars don't really solve the problem either. While they don't pollute by producing exhaust, most of the electricity in the US is obtained from coal, which puts outÂ 6.5 ounces of carbonÂ per mile, which is about half the emissions of gasoline-powered cars.Â  But don't go out and buy yourself a new Hummer just yet. The less mileage your car has, the better walking looks in comparison. Also, if you're eating a mostly vegetarian diet, your energy consumption and pollution through food is minimized.
Toronto-based tailor Garrison Bespoke has started making bullet-proof suits for businessmen who travel to dangerous parts of the world, the Globe and Mail reports. [via DailyMail] These custom three-piece suits are made with armored material meant to shield the wearer's vital organs from bullets and knives. What's more is the suits designed to be discreet and comfortable, according to the tailor's website.  From Garison:  This past year, Garrison Bespoke worked alongside suppliers for the US 19th Special Forces in developing the custom bulletproof suit. Using nanotechnology, it’s comprised of the same carbon nanotubes designed for the US troops’ uniforms in Iraq. Yet, the patented suit material is a lot thinner and flexible; fifty percent lighter than Kevlar (the material commonly used in bullet-proof gear). The entire suit acts like a shield, with nanotubes in the fabric hardening to block force from penetrating through. They retail at $20,000 per suit.  According to City News, there's already a wait list.    You can see bullets being fired on this suit in this City News clip below:   
REUTERS/Gary CameronFacing eight different investigations and probes, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon told his employees to cut it out with the mischievous instant messages that can land them in trouble, Bloomberg's Gavin Finch and Ambereen Choudhury report. "Don’t exaggerate, don’t ruminate, don’t bullshit," Dimon reportedly told his London office. "I'm serious." Sources told Bloomberg that Dimon urged employees, "We all need to keep a higher standard." Dimon's comments come amid new regulatory scrutiny (as if they needed more) over alleged manipulation of the currency market. JP Morgan disclosed recently that authorities were questioning the bank over its practices, and competitor Barclays has already suspended six traders after an internal probe into the matter.

Hugo Chavez's successor, Nicolas Maduro, is getting desperate. Today, he is supposed to announce new measures to reform the Venezuelan economy â€” an economy that, for the last 12 months, has had an average inflation rate of almost 50% and faced shortages of staples like toilet paper. What's worse, is that the 2014 budget the Venezuelan legislature proposed last month basically ignores all those facts, and bases its allocations on an inflation outlook of 26-28%. Meanwhile, there are signs everywhere that Maduro is grasping at any possible shred of political legitimacy he can get his hands on. Last month, he asked the legislature to grant him special powers to combat corruption and economic sabotage. It can't be stressed enough â€” he is no Chavez. So his administration has to compensate. And here are some bizarre ways he's doing it. So yeah, things are getting weird.
APMayor-elect Bill de Blasio will be New York's most pro-development mayor in decades. He'll have no choice but to be. De Blasio has an expansive, progressive vision for remaking the city: Greatly expanding affordable housing, providing universal pre-kindergarten, and combating income inequality. That's all going to cost money. He also faces big fiscal challenges: The city's annual budget is around $70 billion, and he faces a $2 billion deficit in the coming fiscal year. His plan to expand pre-kindergarten and after school programs will cost another $530 million a year. The city's looming, unfunded liabilities for retiree benefits constrain spending options. Most city worker unions have been out of contract for four years and they want raises. In fact, because their base pay has been flat for the four years they've been out of contract, they want retroactive raises totaling $7 billion. They won't get that because the money simply isn't there. But they haven't held out all these years refusing to sign contracts with Mike Bloomberg only to get nothing from the city's new, progressive mayor. The city and agencies that serve the city (principally, the Port Authority and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority) have huge capital needs. In order to gain jobs and residents, the city will need to invest in infrastructure, but what few funds are available are likely to get sucked into the hellmouth that is employee compensation. De Blasio has proposed a tax increase on people making over $500,000 a year, but that won't be a solution to his fiscal challenges. First, the tax increase he's proposed is small: just $530 million a year, or less than 1% of the city's budget. Second, it requires approval from New York's state legislature and Governor Andrew Cuomo, who are likely to be resistant. If he hopes to buy labor peace and fulfill his progressive missions, de Blasio will have to find another way to get more money coming into the city's coffers. That's where development comes in. To the untrained ear, de Blasio has run as a critic of developers, complaining that too many "luxury condos" are going up in New York. But he has also been clear that more development is a key to growing the city's economy and addressing the affordability crisis. And while many of the city's business elites are freaking out about de Blasio's "class warfare," he's maintained good links with (and raised a lot of money from) the real estate industry. Last summer, de Blasio gave a speech to NYU's Wagner School of Public Service on fostering economic development in New York City. The speech is worth reading in full, but it's especially interesting for de Blasio's strong pro-development bias: First and foremost, when given the choice to grow or to sit idle, we need to grow and we have to be aggressive about it. There are factors beyond our control â€” economic conditions, bureaucratic interference from afar â€” that can kill good projects. The things I value as a progressive â€” good jobs and affordable housing â€” cannot happen if projects stall or never materialize. If we arenâ€™t doing everything possible as a City government to spur on development, even if valid compromises are included, we risk nothing getting built at all, and that is the worst possible outcome. De Blasio has been critical of the Bloomberg-era approach to fostering development, which has relied heavily on subsidies and tax credits to induce developers to build affordable housing. He wants a new approach, which would make "inclusionary zoning" (a set aside of housing-units at restricted rents or prices for low and moderate-income families) mandatory. But he's smart enough to know he can't get something or nothing, which is why he's repeatedly said he wants to give developers increased development rightsÂ â€” the ability to build more square feet of building on a given plot of landÂ â€” in exchange for affordable housing. The problem with these sorts of upzonings is that they are often politically unpopular: Incumbent residents resist greater density because of the construction, noise, crowds and cars it brings to their neighborhoods. That's why Bloomberg focused his upzoning efforts on neighborhoods like Williamsburg and Long Island City where the prior use was light industrial and few residents were around to complain. But the city is running out of well-located neighborhoods like this, and the loss of warehouse and similar space due to these neighborhoods' transformation has been driving up the cost of doing business here. The next round of upzonings will have to come in neighborhoods full of existing residents and all the political resistance they bring. De Blasio will have a key advantage in getting those upzonings done: by tying upzonings to inclusionary housing and the affordable housing issue, he will be able to paint NIMBY opponents of density as opponents of affordable housing. The debate won't be over whether every part of New York should be given over to luxury condo towers; it will be about whether we can grow our way into housing affordability. If he upzones aggressively with an inclusionary housing mandate, de Blasio will be able to meet much of his goal of 220,000 new or preserved units of affordable housing at no taxpayer expense. The development will generate fees, transfer taxes and property taxes that will pay for his other policy goals. In some neighborhoods, the city could even sell off the added development rights, as Bloomberg is proposing to do with his last zoning legacy: An upzoning of the office district near Grand Central Terminal in Midtown. Inclusionary zoning is not my preferred approach to affordable housing. Directing developers to build luxury apartments and rent them at a discount to people with low incomes is an inefficient way of housing the poor and the middle class. But the land under New York City is so valuable that upzoning it will create tremendous economic and fiscal benefits, even if some of those benefits are allocated inefficiently. The approach isn't perfect, but I'll take it. This is why the "Sandinista" critique of de Blasio was so silly. He is definitely a tax-and-transfer liberal who wants to redistribute the economic gains that have, in the last decade, accrued mostly at the top. But he understands how essential robust private economic activity is to making those transfers possible. If de Blasio hopes to achieve his broader progressive agenda, he'll have to get the real estate issue more or less rightÂ â€” and that bodes very well for development, affordability and growth in New York City.
Wikimedia Commons/SomersleaAthletic people, often stereotyped as being "dumb jocks" or "meatheads", have a higher likelihood of being employed and of having higher incomes.Â  This is according to research by Michael Lechner of St. Gallens University in Switzerland and Paul Downward, a sports economist at Loughborough University.Â  The study looks at a dataset of sports participation and employment rates for of over 170,000 people in England in 2009-2010. The sports were aggregated into five categories: team sports (eg. football, basketball and cricket), fitness activities (track and field, cycling), racquet sports (tennis, squash), leisure activities (bowling, dancing) and outdoor activities (skiing, hiking). The results are then compared to employment across races, genders and ages.Â  Those with a disability or severe long-term illness were not included in the study. The results are striking. Men aged 26-45 are 2.8% less likely to be unemployed than men in the same age group who do not play a sport. Similarly, women aged 26-45 who do play a sport are 5.2% more likely to be employed than their non-sport playing counterparts.  Furthermore, participating in physical activity bumped up incomes for both men and women by more than 10%.  The table below summarizes the differences.Â  The currency used for household income is the British pound. www1.vwa.unisg.ch Within the various sports categories, notable differences were found. Younger men that played fitness sports and indulged in outdoor activities had higher incomes than those who played team sports. But, as they got older, team sports were correlated with higher earnings.  View the whole study here.

Bloomberg TVKatie Jacobs Stanton, Twitter's head of international.Twitter's IPO is ready to price, and, predictably, many pundits are going on about how stupid investors are to buy the stock. Twitter is losing money, these pundits observe. It's a social network, like the disastrous Facebook. Twitter hasn't proven anything yet. Twitter investors are so deluded and ridiculous, these pundits roar, that they've already agreed to buy Twitter stock at $25 a share! (A $17 billion valuation.) Whatever you do, don't get taken in by this. Anyone who bashes Twitter because it's "losing money" or "is like Facebook" or hasn't "proven anything" is the most dangerous form of market pundit: Articulate enough to sound knowledgeable to someone who knows absolutely nothing, but so unsophisticated that he or she can't be bothered to ask why some of the smartest investors in the world are so excited about Twitter. In case you're curious about the latter — why so many smart investors are so willing to pay up for Twitter, and why the stock is likely to trade much higher than the IPO price (probably into the mid $30s or $40s) — here are some of the key points. (And to be super-clear: This isn't investment advice, and I couldn't care less if you buy the stock. I in fact think you shouldn't buy the stock, because I think stock-picking is generally a stupid strategy, especially for individuals. I'm just trying to help you understand why OTHER smart investors are buying the stock). First, there are some very important differences between the Twitter IPO and the Facebook IPO (which, by the way, has worked out just fine for those who actually invested in it instead of bought it with the aim of getting a quick score): Contrast this to Facebook when it went public: In other words, the success and power of Facebook's business was already crystal clear to almost all investors, Facebook's business trends were getting worse, and there was no shortage of stock available. And there were also other problems that plagued Facebook's IPO, all of which are unique to Facebook. These things matter to the prices investors are willing to pay. And, for Facebook and Twitter, they could not be more different. Second, most skeptical pundits appear to be drastically underestimating how profitable Twitter may eventually be. The mistake many investors made with LinkedIn, another social network that went public a couple of years ago and has had a spectacular stock run ever since, is that they failed to see how profitable the company could become. They looked at LinkedIn's financials at the IPO and took the "losses" to mean that LinkedIn would never make money. In fact, LinkedIn was investing heavily at the time of the IPO, and these investments have helped it grow its revenue to a level that most IPO observers would have considered unthinkable. And LinkedIn's growth and cost structure has now made it highly profitable. One thing that all of these social networks have in common, in other words, is their cost structure. Unlike traditional media companies, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Google, and other social media and tech powered media companies don't have any content costs. These companies provide a "platform" to hundreds of millions of users, and the users then create the content for free. That is a massive advantage from a financial perspective. And it's a factor that anyone who thinks Twitter's current losses mean it can never make money has not spent enough time considering. How profitable could Twitter be? The company says its ultimate goal is to have a 30% EBITDA margin (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization). That's a healthy EBITDA margin.  But Twitter is being absurdly conservative here. With zero content costs, Twitter should ultimately be able to achieve an EBITDA margin of at least 50%. If that strikes you as silly, take a look at Facebook. The company has already achieved an operating margin of 50%. Why wouldn't Twitter be able to do that? In short, if you're thinking about Twitter's value by extrapolating the current losses, you're not understanding what the smart institutional investors that are buying Twitter are seeing. These institutional investors, in all likelihood, are seeing a possible future profit margin of 50%+. Like any investment, and especially an emerging tech/media/communications investment, Twitter has many risks. The three big Twitter risks, from my perspective, are these: (If these two observations aren't completely obvious to you, please turn off the TV and back away from the "buy" button.  Every sophisticated investor knows these things, and if you are trying to outwit sophisticated investors without knowing them, you are the kind of market participant that every sophisticated investor dreams of playing against — a major-league sucker.) Instead of trying to calculate exactly what Twitter is worth (again, no one knows), it's probably more helpful to estimate what the collective wisdom of millions of investors might estimate that it is worth. (Say what you will about bubbles, the academics will tell you — rightly — that the collective guess of many smart people is generally more accurate than the guess of any particular one.) So what might the market conclude that Twitter is worth? Well, let's look at the value the market is placing on Twitter's two closest comparables: Facebook and LinkedIn. Facebook and LinkedIn are both trading at observable multiples of 2014 and 2015 revenue and earnings estimates. Twitter is at an earlier stage than both Facebook and LinkedIn, so its earnings multiples are going to be much less relevant than the earnings multiples for Facebook and LinkedIn. So we'll look at revenue multiples. (Again, Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn appear to have a very similar cost structure. So they should ultimately be able to achieve similar profitability. So, all else being equal, they should trade at similar revenue multiples.) What are, say, the 2o15 revenue multiples for Facebook and LinkedIn? The market's estimate of revenue for Facebook in 2015 is about $13 billion. With a market value of $120 billion, Facebook is trading at 9X 2015 estimated revenue. The market's estimate of revenue for LinkedIn in 2015 is about $2.5 billion. With a market value of $27 billion, LinkedIn is trading at 11X 2015 estimated revenue. In other words, Facebook and LinkedIn are trading at about 10X 2015 estimated revenue. So what about Twitter? At the high end of its IPO price range, $25, Twitter will be valued at about $17 billion. A reasonable estimate for Twitter's 2015 revenue, which has already been published by a couple of analysts, is about $2 billion. So the high end of Twitter's IPO range is about 8X Twitter's estimated revenue for 2015. My guess is that most investors will quickly conclude that there's no reason Twitter should have a lower revenue multiple than Facebook or LinkedIn. Yes, Twitter might be riskier and have more to prove, but it's also younger and growing faster. Put those things together, and a 10X multiple seems reasonable. So what price would Twitter be if it traded at 10X 2015 estimated revenue? About $30 a share. Several analysts, including the excellent Robert Peck of SunTrust, think that Twitter could trade to $50 by the end of next year. Peck's logic is reasonable, so many investors will probably agree with it. If enough investors agree with Peck, Twitter could trade even higher than $35 a share on its opening day — maybe even into the $40s. So don't be shocked if you see Twitter trade that high after the IPO. And don't immediately conclude that everyone buying Twitter at that level is obviously a moron. These investors may turn out to be wrong and end up losing money (all investors may end up losing money). But, unlike those who are dismissing Twitter's IPO as "ridiculous" because the company is "losing money," these investors have reasonable logic underlying their purchases. Disclosure: I think trading individual stocks is a stupid strategy for individual investors, largely because of how smart and informed most big institutional investors are (You are competing against them, and you are at as big a disadvantage as your local Little League team would be if it played the New York Yankees). I do, very occasionally, for fun, take a plunge, as I did with Apple earlier this year. But the vast majority of my portfolio is in index funds, and I won't be "playing" the Twitter IPO.
Benjamin Hoste/NarrativelyHe once conquered the commodities market and got rich in real estate. Now heâ€™s a cab driver, coffee salesman and ghost tour guide â€” and mastering every role. On a warm Thursday evening, an upturned, black top hat rests on the bar where David Riordan is perched on a stool, watching the door for customers. Heâ€™s expecting twenty people, give or take, a small crowd compared to his forty-person-plus Saturday night sessions. â€œIâ€™m getting a little sick of it,â€ he whispers. â€œItâ€™s the end of the season.â€ Spotting the Riordan Tours logo embroidered on his black polo, a woman approaches. â€œYour group here for the tour?â€ Riordan asks. Sheâ€™s alone, she answers, visiting from Colorado. â€œWhere?â€ he asks, and she demurs, explaining itâ€™s a small town. â€œI am intimately familiar with Colorado,â€ Riordan insists. â€œI sell coffee to people in Colorado.â€ He used to sell real estate to millionaires in Spain. Before that, wheat futures to buyers on the commodities market. But the recession was not kind to Riordan. Now, atÂ fifty-three, he works in customer service in his familyâ€™s native St. Louis, driving a cab on the side for extra cash. And at night, he sells ghost stories for $20 a ticket. Benjamin Hoste/NarrativelyThe Morgan Street Brewery serves as the rendezvous point for David Riordan's tours. The restaurant staff knows Riordan by name, tour flyers adorn the maitre d's desk, and tour guests often pour drinks into paper cups to carry with them during tours.When the hour strikes seven p.m., Riordan jumps off his stool and strides to the exit. Customers empty their beer bottles into plastic cups and follow him outside, where the Mississippi River reflects the sunsetâ€™s pink glow. Three carriages wait for passengers on the cobblestone street as steam rises through manhole covers. Top hat planted on his white hair, Riordan climbs onto a brick porch to survey the assembled audience. â€œSt. Louis is the fourth-most-haunted city in America,â€ he says by way of introduction. â€œIt canâ€™t compete with New Orleans, Savannah or St. Augustine. But your tour guide is No. 1.â€ Several people titter politely. â€œTwo hundred fifty years ago, St. Louis was founded,â€ he continues with the spirited cadence of a town crier. â€œThese people were river scum. These people were not at all like you. They drank, smoked and gambled.â€ A few more laughs. A horse snorts. â€œIâ€™m a seventh-generation St. Louis person,â€ he says. â€œMy familyâ€™s been here since 1832.â€ He goes on to explain how they owned well-respected businesses in town, which were mostly known for their off-color slogans: â€œYou furnish the girl, weâ€™ll furnish the rest,â€ promised Grimm's furniture. â€œIâ€™m extraordinarily politically incorrect, too,â€ he promises. Riordanâ€™s seen a spirit, he assures themâ€”not in St. Louis, but heâ€™s seen one, alright. It was at age thirteen, while staying at the Getty mansion in England with his stepfather, a Getty Oil executive. â€œI donâ€™t expect weâ€™ll see ghosts tonight,â€ he cautions, since itâ€™s more a haunted history tour than a real ghost hunt. â€œBut you can never be quite sure.â€ Benjamin Hoste/NarrativelyAlthough Laclede's Landing has a number of restaurants, bars, and tourist attractions, many of the storefronts are vacant, and late at night the area adopts a dodgy vibe.The route itself may be the most frightening part of the experience, running far from the sloppy bars at Lacledeâ€™s Landing, under subway tracks, through alleys and onto the forested Gateway Arch grounds. Most St. Louisans donâ€™t hang out downtown after dark, and certainly not near the river, where the homeless people make them nervous. The tour guide knows this. â€œIf someone comes out of the woods with a chainsaw, run like hell,â€ Riordan says. â€œItâ€™s the real thing.â€ He hops down from the stoop and takes off into the night. * Â  * Â  * â€œDo you know Fibonacci? You do?â€ Riordan leans forward on his bar stool. â€œMy dog was named Fibber. Fibonacciâ€™s my hero.â€ Heâ€™s sweating, having just led a ninety-minute tour only a few hours after working a full day selling coffee by phone to Hyatts and Marriotts, Days Inns and Super 8s. Itâ€™s late, and his teenage son is recording the game for him at home. But Riordan has one more story to tell, and his audience of oneÂ is attentive. The glimmer of a grin crosses his face. â€œMarkets react in Fibonacci ways,â€ Riordan says. As he explains it, financial markets reflect the properties of the famed Fibonacci sequence of numbers, which predict natural patterns such as the swirls of sunflower seeds and chambered Nautilus shells. â€œIâ€™m a student of Fibonacci. Itâ€™s probably the only thing Iâ€™ve ever studied seriously in my life.â€ That last partâ€™s not true. Riordan studied public policy at Duke, business at Columbia and law at William &amp; Mary. Before that he learned to write at Phillips Exeter Academy. He picked up Spanish in Spain when he was in his twenties by studying six hours a day for five months whileÂ between jobs. â€œYouâ€™re gonna have a hard time finding anybody to play 'match the degree' with me,â€ he says. But Riordan specializes in hyperbole, and anyway, the details donâ€™t matterâ€”the story matters. The facts can be fluid. â€œI got a job working for Continental Grain Company,â€ he says, â€œmy first real job,â€ at the age of twenty-five, in a grain elevator across the river on the outskirts of St. Louis. There, the young schemer pulled off â€œthe most brilliant thing I ever did in my life.â€ Benjamin Hoste/NarrativelyThe Morgan Street Brewery. It was the drought of 1988, the countryâ€™s costliest, which left some states more parched than theyâ€™d been in a century. President Ronald Reagan called it the worst natural disaster since the Dust Bowl. â€œCorn and soybean prices went crazy,â€ Riordan says. Itâ€™s not clear how this relates to the Italian mathematician, but Riordan is a master of the long exposition. â€œTraditionallyâ€”youâ€™re gonna have a hard time understanding thisâ€”traditionally, wheatâ€™s worth twice what cornâ€™s worth. For the first time in history, ever, in the history of world, corn was more expensive than wheat.â€ For three days, Riordan watched the prices rise, salivating over the unusual opportunity. He was new to the commodities company, â€œa peon,â€ in his words, but he analyzed the market to confirm what he suspected: There was money to be made. â€œI went so far out on a limb,â€ Riordan says. â€œI sent an urgent memo to the president. I urged everyone to hedge wheat with corn.â€ It was risky, but Riordan bet the market would turn, as Fibonacci patterns of price hikes and plunges predict. And his boss bit. Riordan takes a long drink. â€œOur local office made $22 million,â€ he says finally. â€œI was a frigginâ€™ hero.â€ His trajectory seemed certain: an oil executiveâ€™s stepson with degrees from the right schools, fresh off his first major coup, poised to become a commodities baron. But it didnâ€™t work out that way. As he likes to say, â€œShit hit the fan.â€ * Â  * Â  * The orange harvest moon hangs over the tour guideâ€™s right shoulder as he sets his back to the river. The air is rich with the aroma of yeast, carried north from the original Anheuser-Busch brewery. A few stories in, Riordan hits his stride, recounting duels, fires and demon possessions with the easy manner of a professor. He punctuates his stories physically, laying thick foundations and constructing layers of detail until he shoves the punch line into placeâ€”then races away, leaving his one-liners to linger. â€œThis is Clamorgan Alley, the most haunted place in St. Louis by far,â€ Riordan says as he climbs the steps of a neglected brick building. â€œI have smelled death here.â€ Benjamin Hoste/NarrativelyThe St. Louis Arch as viewed from Clamorgan Alley in Laclede's Landing. A cholera outbreak in 1849 claimed the lives of thousands whose bodies were stacked in Clamorgan Alley until Irish immigrants were hired to move them across town and bury them. It is claimed to be the most haunted place in St. Louis.Bodies once were piled high in this alley, a depository for the victims of the 1849 St. Louis cholera epidemic. In those days, horse droppings mingled on the street with the contents of chamber pots. Sewage ran right into the river. It was a sanitation disaster, and cholera spread quickly. â€œSymptoms include uncontrollable vomiting and explosive diarrhea,â€ Riordan says. He points to a woman holding an infant. â€œYou know something about that, donâ€™t you?â€ Couples scoot closer as Riordan describes the mounting death toll and the Irish laborers tasked with taking the bodies to a cemetery outside town. The tour takers amble into the woods in silence. As Riordan starts a story about lead poisoning, the group rounds the corner and catches sight of the Gateway Arch, its graceful limbs gleaming. They reach for their phones to snap pictures, and for a few minutes, nothing Riordan says can recapture their attention. He doesnâ€™t seem to mind. â€œIf people arenâ€™t listening, thatâ€™s fine,â€ he says later. â€œIâ€™m selling an experience.â€ * Â  * Â  * Dissatisfied with the small raise Continental Grain offered in return for his winning gamble, â€œI quit,â€ Riordan says. â€œI threw a hissy fit. I shouldnâ€™t have. I was a star at the company, probably would have been president by now. I was an asshole.â€ For the next seven years, Riordan invested his own money on the Chicago Board of Trade floor, staring at blue screens and elbowing through hordes of frantic traders. â€œI wasnâ€™t intellectually stimulated,â€ he says, even though the payout was impressive. â€œItâ€™s a lot more physical and a lot more boring than you think.â€ He tried law school, hoping to â€œchange the world, make a difference, help people,â€ he says. â€œI sucked at it. The only thing Iâ€™ve ever sucked at in my life.â€ He means he made Bs. â€œI was average, and Iâ€™ve always excelled at everything. Iâ€™m always in the top two percent of everything I do.â€ In 2001, after a short stint in private practice,Â Riordan moved with his wife and two young kids to Spain, having first fallen for the country during his half-year language immersion and again while honeymooning there. Two hours from the southern tip of the Iberian Peninsula lies Frigiliana, one of the White Towns of Andalusia, named for the bleached houses that cling to the mountains surrounding the Alboran Sea. Flowers spill from clay pots that line the steep streets. Moors, Jews and Catholics left traces in the cityâ€™s crevices, their histories layered like pavement over the town squares. Riordan fell in love with stories here, on the cliffs overlooking the Moorish Mediterranean. In Frigiliana, he sold real estate and worked recording ads, playing music and telling jokes on the air for 97.6 Coastline FM, the English-language radio station he bought into after the owner told him he had an exceptional radio voice. Enamored of the townâ€™s white homes and winding lanes, Riordan was shocked to find tourists were unimpressed. â€œI saw people get off the bus, look around and go into the new part of town,â€ he says. He sensed an opportunity. Waiting by the bus stop, the entrepreneur offered, for a few Euros, to show travelers centuries-old chapels, the sugar mill andÂ El Fuerte, the hilltop battlefield where Christian forces defeated rebelling Moors in 1569. â€œI did it as a public service,â€ Riordan says. At first, only a few visitors took up his offer. â€œThen, Iâ€™m getting fifteen people, and guidebooks are recommending me,â€ he says. Soon he was up to two tours daily, five days a week. Benjamin Hoste/NarrativelyThe restless renaissance man discovered a passion. â€œI adored my tours. I developed material I wanted to share with people. It just grew and grew,â€ he says. â€œI became morbidly obsessed with the Spanish Inquisition. Do you know what a garrote is? They would tie you to a chair, and they had a screw that would screw into the back of your neck. Just for the heck of it. They were sadistic bastards. It was really disgusting shit. The highlight of my tour life was when I had a woman throw up in the middle of my descriptions.â€ Marching past his neighborsâ€™ homes in the dark and talking about torture earned the loud American some enemies in Frigiliana. An irritated British couple banged their shutters to disrupt him. He retaliated with a birthday party full of nine-year-olds. â€œâ€˜Children, thereâ€™s a witch and warlock who live on this street,â€™â€ he recalls telling the kids. â€œâ€˜If they come out of their house, theyâ€™ll probably be ranting. You be quiet and let them have their say, then give them a big round of applause, itâ€™s all part of the show.â€™â€ The homeowner threw open the door and berated Riordan for disturbing his dinner party. â€œAt the end, they clap!â€ Riordan laughs. â€œIt was the highlight of my life.â€ He left a legacy in town, the annual Three Cultures Festival, inspired by the title of the guidebook he sold in local shops: â€œFrigiliana: The Village of Three Cultures.â€ Riordan devised the phrase after noticing a 500-year-old ceramic marked with intertwined Islamic, Jewish and Christian symbols. â€œIt kind of stuck,â€ he says of the slogan. â€œThe Spaniards all thought it was great.â€ The mayor asked permission to use the image for a cultural celebration. Riordan, whoâ€™d copyrighted and printed it on 10,000 souvenir keychains, was tickled. â€œItâ€™s invented out of whole cloth,â€ he gloats. â€œThis American gave this 2,500-year-old village its identity.â€ The village helped Riordan find his identity, too. But he abandoned it when the 2008 recession hit Spain harder than almost anywhere else. â€œI lost like four million dollars in Spanish real estate,â€ Riordan says. â€œI owned nine different houses and apartment houses that were worth seven million dollars, but I owed the bank three million, and then overnight they were worth half.â€ He offloaded the properties as quickly as he could. â€œIt was smart to sell them,â€ he says. â€œI got out and still have my ass.â€ â€œBut my wife loved me more when I was rich,â€ he adds. â€œI said, â€˜Weâ€™re moving back to America,â€™ and she said, â€˜Iâ€™m not.â€™â€ He returns to his drink. â€œIâ€™m not rich anymore.â€ * Â  * Â  * On less haunted nights, the tour guide drives a taxi. Heâ€™s the only Yellow Cab part-timer in town, putting in twelve to fifteen hours a week in the summer, more in the winter. Itâ€™s flexible, he explains: As long as the cab company gets $300 a week, they donâ€™t care how often he drives. â€œIf I have a date, if my kids have a game, I donâ€™t go,â€ he says. Riordan usually ends up telling a few jokes to his clients; in the winter, he practices new ghost stories. He laughs at the cabbies who wait for hours outside the ballpark and the airport, as he finds it more lucrative to instead make frequent runs across the county. â€œMost make $25 or $26 an hour,â€ he says. â€œI bring in about $41 an hour. I wouldnâ€™t do it if I were average at it.â€ He could have settled anywhere five years ago, but returned to St. Louis because of his familyâ€™s roots and his auntâ€™s invitation to house him and his kids while he looked for work. His first gig was part-time, selling prison care packages for $12 an hour. Then he was promoted into the companyâ€™s coffee sales division. Every day, he makes sure hotels have enough decaf and dark roast and French vanilla. On his lunch break, he returns calls from bachelorette parties and alumni groups who want to hear about ghosts. Benjamin Hoste/NarrativelyThe St. Louis Arch is lit at night by both park lights and street lights from downtown St. Louis. In the distance sit the Cargill grain elevators, which sit upon a sandbar that once was an island in the Mississippi River known as Bloody Island due to the numerous duels that were carried there, according to Riordan. One such duel featured a young Abraham Lincoln. The island was later adjoined to the Illinois banks by the Army Corps of Engineers. He loves his tours, but theyâ€™re not just a hobby anymore. â€œI need to make money, Iâ€™m a single dad,â€ Riordan says. Both of his kids moved back to the U.S. with him; his daughter is currently in college and his son attends a private middle school. â€œI work eighty hours a week. Iâ€™ve got a middle class-plus job, Iâ€™m working my ass off, but Iâ€™m providing for my kids, and Iâ€™m proud of that. The cab is easy, this is really easy, the coffee job is easy, itâ€™s so low-stress.â€ Still, heâ€™s restless. â€œItâ€™s not my dream,â€ he shrugs. â€œMy dream is to sail around the world and write. I could have done it when I was twenty-eight years old; I didnâ€™t because I wanted to be responsible. Iâ€™m still gonna do it. Five or six years from now. Iâ€™ll get on a boat and sail away.â€ * Â  * Â  * After pointing his customers to the parking lot, Riordan removes the top hat with relief and heads toward the bar. Heâ€™s a little impatient when a young man stops him to ask a history question, but Riordan pays full attention when he offers to help design tour t-shirts. â€œEmail me tomorrow,â€ Riordan says. â€œYou can have a free one.â€ Inside, Riordan stirs the ghosts of his former lives, marveling at chances taken and missed and enjoying his own retellings. â€œThe tour in Spain was about twice as good as this, twice as successful. Itâ€™s one of the things Iâ€™m proudest of in my life,â€ he says. â€œSince I know itâ€™s not as good as the Spain tour, it eats at me a little bit. But Iâ€™m working to make it better.â€ He must sense a punch line coming, because without warning he jumps off his stool and hurries to the door. Or maybe itâ€™s just late; heâ€™s got a son at home and work in the morning. Halfway down the street, he turns back to call out, answering a question about what he plans to do next. â€œA bed-and-breakfast in Mexico,â€ he says. â€œIâ€™ll do tours. Every place has good stories.â€ * Â  * Â  * Rebecca KoenigÂ is a St. Louis-based journalist who works as managing editor forÂ Town &amp; Style, a weekly culture and lifestyle magazine.

American Psycho screengrabHow do you know when you're face-to-face with a psychopath? There are more out there than we'd like to imagine, and they all tend to exhibit essentially the same traits, says behavioral analyst Lillian Glass, a language expert who's worked with the FBI on unmasking signals of deception. Psychopathy is an anti-social personality disorder where the sufferer tends to adopt erratic and impulsive behaviors. Psychopaths have an inability to internalize social norms.  While it's difficult to know how many psychopaths reside in the U.S., a survey cited in a Reuters article found that out of the 500 senior executive respondents in the U.S. and U.K., 26% said they had "observed or had firsthand knowledge of wrongdoing in the workplace" and 24% believed that those in the financial industry need to "engage in unethical or illegal conduct to be successful."  Based on Glass' new book "The Body Language of Liars," we pulled out seven red flags that you may be dealing with a psychopath in the cube next door. Researchers have found psychopaths use past tense more than present tense, which could signal that they're detached from the present, writes Glass. "Because psychopaths are entitled and see the world and others as theirs for the taking, researchers at the University of British Columbia found that they used more words such as 'because' and 'so that'" says Glass, since they tend to rationalize their actions with their own logic. Since they're typically not occupied with anything else, psychopaths think about their basic needs a lot, such as food, shelter, and clothing, writes Glass. When talking about their basic needs, psychopaths tend to use twice as many words as usual or provide too much information. Psychopaths usually think that they're the victims, which comes from their sense of entitlement, says Glass. "The psychopath will speak of himself in grandiose terms while blaming others and taking no responsibility for his actions," she says. You can hear this in the lack and emotion of their voice. This may even happen within the same sentence. "[Psychopaths] will lie or omit information when you ask them a question, but they may tell you the truth if you rephrase the question slightly. Researchers have discovered that this has to do with the particular way their brain is wired," says Glass.  "When [Susan Smith] gave a press conference and cried about her missing children, her fake tears were actually what raised suspicions that she was the killer," says Glass. When psychopaths cry, Glass says they will often wipe underneath each eye, one at a time. "When people cry genuine tears they cry with both eyes, and so they will tend to wipe both eyes at once." Glass says psychopaths will often say one thing, but their body language will tell a different story. For example, while saying the word "yes," the psychopath could be shaking their head no.
JP Morgan's potential $13 billion settlement with the government hasn't been finalized yet, but already politicians and public interest groups are crying foul because up to $9 billion of the settlement is tax deductible. That means the bank could write $3 billion off their corporate tax bill as a business expense, according to Americans for Tax Fairness and the U.S. PIRG, the federation of state Public Interest Research Groups. On Monday, Americans for Tax Fairness and the U.S. PIRG presented Congress with a 160,000 signature petition asking the Justice Department to add a provision to the settlement that would stop this from happening, and a bunch of Congressmen have jumped on board, calling U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to do something. â€œTaxpayers should not be subsidizing more than $3 billion of JPMorganâ€™s penalties at a time when federal priorities like education, clean energy, infrastructure and other job creating investments are facing budget cuts. This settlement has to be meaningful if it is going to deter future abuses. I join the 150,000 people today who are urging Attorney General Holder to stand firm and fight for taxpayers and middle class families,â€ said Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI). Hirono is the lead signatory on a letter sent to the Justice Department by five Senators â€” Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Bill Nelson (D-FL), Martin Heinrich (D-NM), and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) â€” urging the DOJ to "ensure the final settlement is clear about the tax treatment of the entire settlement amount and explicitly prohibits the tax deductibility of such payments.â€ And lest you think this idea has no bipartisan support, Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) is in the mix too. â€œA settlement has to mean something or it wonâ€™t have the deterrent effect itâ€™s supposed to have,â€ says Grassley. â€œFederal agencies should do everything they can in negotiating settlements to limit deductions.â€ At the same time, Congressman Peter Welch (D-VT) has introduced a bill to the House that would end the corporate tax deductibility of all legal settlements, it's called The Stop Deducting Damages Act(HR 3445). He also sent a letter to Jamie Dimon â€” here's a snippet (you can read it in full here): It was the taxpayer who initially funded the bailout of Wall Street. It was the taxpayer who continues to endure the consequences of the worst recession since the Great Depression. The taxpayer should not, therefore, be required to contribute a nickel towards the fines imposed for conduct that got America into this mess in the first place. So in case you're wondering why it's taking JP Morgan so long to cough up $13 billion â€” this could be one of the snags.
Abercrombie &amp; Fitch shares are falling after the company reported horrible sales results. Third quarter comparable-store sales fell 14%, the company said in a statement. Shares fell about 6% on the news. "Our results for the third quarter reflect continued top-line challenges, with overall spending among younger consumers remaining weak," Jeffries said. "Until we have seen a clear trend improvement, we are continuing to take a cautious approach into the fourth quarter and are working to end the year with appropriate levels of fall carryover inventory." Abercrombie has been criticized for not updating its fashions for the fickle teen market and sticking to a preppy aesthetic that many feel is outdated.Â  Teens are also going to the mall less frequently, meaning they aren't frequenting Abercrombie stores as much.Â 
A Harvard MBA candidate, who has worked at some major financial firms, has some excellent advice on Quora on how to crush an investment management interview.Â  Interviewing in investment management is supposed to be really challenging. However,Â the Quora user simplifies it by breaking the interview process down into two key parts â€” behavioral (basically everything about you as a person) and skills/knowledge.Â  Here's his advice (emphasis ours):Â  The interview can be broken down into 2 portions: Your game plan should be to come up with the rough content of what you want to say (write it out, bullet points, etc., whatever works for you). And then practice practice practice. Ask a friend to mock interview you and work on your delivery. Get constant feedback. You can always do better than the last time. The stock pitch is definitely important. Â Another Quora emphasized that people wanting to get into investment management need to prepare way in advance.Â  From Quora: Â  Stock pitch(es): you have to pitch 1-3 stocks, Buy or Sell. The prep time for this is anywhere between 1 to 3 months as you understand the companies' business models, estimate their future performance and fair value of stock price with models and, most important of all, create the investment theses that support the Buy or Sell decisions. I would say prepare 2-3 stock pitches well but have 4-5 more additional ideas as well. Usually this takes 50-60% of the interview time - even more in the initial rounds. We've heard this before. Hedge fund manager Whitney Tilson told us that if you want a job with him, you need to send him an idea, not a rÃ©sumÃ©. Â Daniel Loeb of Third Point has also asked recruits in the past for their best investment ideas.Â  Now start preparing.Â 
On newsstands this week, the December issue of Bloomberg Markets magazine provides a comprehensive list of the richest people on the planet.Â  A lot of the names on the list â€” Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, the Koch brothers â€” are pretty familiar. Still, how does the magazine account for the many billionaires who aren't living with their wealth out in the open? Bloomberg editor Matthew Miller and his team of reporters are responsible for hunting down hidden billionaires, which is sometimes just as exciting as it sounds.Â  "Parts of it are extremely James Bond-esque, whether that's calling up a reporter when we know there's a meeting of a bunch of wealthy people in Paris and have that person take a train from London to Paris to make sure they're camped out at that bar," Miller said to Business Insider. "That's something that we actually did a couple of months ago."Â  Other times, it's not so exciting.Â  "Parts involve lots of Excel spreadsheets and lists of private companies and number crunching. The more realistic way to hunt billionaires is to look at the biggest fast food chains in the U.S.," Miller said. "That's how we found Lynsi Torres." Torres is the 30-year-old owner of In-N-Out Burger, the West Coast's beloved fast food chain. With a company that's worth about $1.1 billion, she's one of the youngest billionaires in the world, yet she chooses to lead a private life and has never appeared on an international wealth ranking.Â  This can be pretty common. A desire for security and a life free from the pestering of luxury retail companies and philanthropic organizations are motivations for keeping extreme wealth under wraps. Miller's team has uncovered more than 90 billionaires in the past year, including Koch Industries director Elaine Marshall and German grocery tycoon Dieter Schwarz, who both appeared on this year's list of the 100 richest people in the world.Â  Another hidden billionaire, Turkish immigrant and Chobani founder Hamdi UlukayaÂ (who was worth $1.1 billion in 2012 but did not make this year's billionaires list), was discovered when some of the Bloomberg reporters were eating breakfast at their desks. "Three of four were having Chobani yogurt, and we questioned who owned it," Miller said. "He's been touted as a great story of American entrepreneurism ever since." Â  After years of researching billionaires, Miller has learned that they all tend to have some things in common.Â  "They all tend to be extremely smart and usually have an idea that is able to penetrate a large consumer base.Â The second thing is ambition â€” these people like to win and don't take no for an answer," Miller said. "The third thing is luck. The only difference between Mark Zuckerberg and the guy who founded Myspace is timing and luck."
Google FinanceThe remarkable bull run in the stock market continues. Moments ago, the Dow Jones Industrial Average got as high as 15,731. This is an all-time intraday high. The S&amp;P 500 is within points of its all-time high. This comes amid little market-moving news. Some experts have warned that stocks may be in the process of forming a bubble. But relative to previous all-time highs, other experts note that the fundamentals of the stock market are much more robust. On Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will publish its October jobs report. "If one word characterizes the market's likely reaction, it'sÂ asymmetric," reported BI's Matthew Boesler previewing the jobs report. "Most seem to agree that, as Citi global head of G-10 FX strategy Steven Englander puts it, "a good number is unambiguously good, whereas a bad number is ambiguously bad."" Wall Street economists polled by Bloomberg are looking for 120,000 nonfarm payrolls in October, down from 148,000 in September.
If you're looking for concrete evidence of the ever widening gap between America's rich and poor, here's a hint: check your zip code. Now more than ever, American neighborhoods tend to be segregated by income, according to a recent study by Cornell's Kendra Bischoff and Stanford's Sean F. Reardon. That means the rich are living near the rich and the poor are packed together in large sections of the country's biggest metropolitan areas, and that creates a vicious cycle for poor families. The latest findings confirm a Pew Research report from last year, which mapped the income segregation in America's biggest cities.
REUTERS/Noah BergerTesla reported Q3 earnings after the bell on Tuesday. The stock is tumbling today. This was in large part because the company delivered 5,500 Model S vehicles, which was below analyst expectations. During the company's earnings call, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said, "we really are production constrained, not demand constrained." This is the key thing that Tesla bears, or anyone trading the stock, should know. According to Musk, the limitation was supply and production, not demand for the vehicles. He said the main constraint on production has been the cells. In fact, he pointed out that they had to hold back car deliveries in the U.S. to deliver to Europe. "U.S. demand or North American demand has continued to increase. We've actually had to starve North American demand in order to feed Europe. We've had European customers that have been waiting for a long time so we've had to constrain deliveries to North America in order to get people their cars, in some cases for two to three years. "I think we could sustain 20,000 cars a year in North America and maybe more than that. But it doesn't make sense for us to try to amplify demand if we aren't able to deliver to that demand. That'll just make people unhappy. "Where we are in Europe, we're in Europe where we were in the U.S. in January or February of this year. It's on the order of 10,000 units a year. But again it doesn't make sense for us to drive that demand higher if we aren't able to meet it. We want to make sure we're laying the groundwork for future demand increase and I think we can get demand in Europe to be similar to that of North America. That seems pretty achievable to me." And this production constraint is spilling into Asia as well. Musk pointed out that they expect to begin deliveries in China in the first quarter of 2014, probably around February. And again iterated that there was no point trying to drive up demand if they couldn't meet it. "I certainly recommend anyone in China who does want to order the car to place their order fairly soon because it looks like that wait time may be accelerating. In other words, the longer you wait, the longer you will have to wait." In the Q2 earnings call, Musk had said that Tesla was striving to become demand limited as opposed to production limited." "What people still don't quite get, is that we're different in that fundamental way from other car companies," said Musk. "What we spend our time doing here, the management team, is how do we ramp up production faster and obviously maintain good quality and keep improving the product. We expect to alleviate a lot of those production constraints next year." Musk has constantly been trying to manage expectations on Tesla. He has previously pointed out that he thinks the stock is overvalued. 
Christie'sThe New York art auction season got off to a slow start last night in another blow to embattled hedge funder Steve Cohen's week. "Mann und Frau (Umarmung)" by Schiele, widely rumored to be owned by the billionaire, did not receive a single bid at Christie's auction, the FT's Elizabeth Paton reports. It has been a rough few days for Cohen, whose SAC Capital Advisors pleaded guilty to insider trading and swallowed a record $1.2 billion fine. A quarter of the "high-profile Impressionist and Modern paintings" went unsold at the auction. Total sales came in at $144.2 million, "well below the low estimate of $188m initially made by the house," according to the report. Read the full report at the FT »

REUTERS/Suzanne Plunkett Wind turbines are seen behind Hunterston B Nuclear Power Station in West Kilbride, Scotland May 15, 2013. The Great American Shale Boom has helped U.S. homeowners and manufacturers alike lower their electricity bills. Across the pond lies a parallel universe. In the last four years, European electricity costs have spiked 17% for homeowners and 21% for industry, according to the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. The situation is most acute in the U.K., where one in six households was spending more than 10% of its income to "maintain adequate warmth" in 2011, according government statistics cited by Reuters' John Kemp. What went wrong? Reuters' Karolin Schaps and Barbara Lewis write that much of the increase is related to the cost of complying with the continent's ambitious carbon emissions targets. The European Union is supposed to cut emissions to 20% below 1990 levels. That's not coming cheap. For instance, German utilities just increased the surcharge levied on consumers to fund more renewables by 18% to 6.24 euro-cents per kilowatt-hour. German households now have the third-highest power bills in Europe. European power suppliers are saying the drive to renewables has caused them to mothball 51 Gigawatts-worth of cheaper fossil fuel-based power sources, or the equivalent of the combined capacity of Belgium, the Czech Republic and Portugal, Bloomberg's Ewa Krukowska, Alessandro Vitelli &amp; Tino Andresen reported. CitiNatgas price differentials Infrastructure improvements are also set to come with a $1 trillion price tag through the end of the decade, Reuters says. "The cost of funding government policies for renewable energy, social support and energy efficiency is increasing faster than any other part of an energy bill," Paul Massara, chief executive of RWE npower told Reuters. The chief of Italian oil giant Eni recently called the situation an emergency and warned Europe's lack of competitiveness was costing investment in continental industry.  As a result, there's talk of putting climate goals on hold to help bring costs down. Bloomberg's Stefan Nicola reports Angela Merkel plans to reduce renewable subsidies once she forms a coalition. And Reuters' columnist John Kemp says Labour Leader Ed Miliband recently "launched a metaphorical grenade" into the country's clean energy consensus when he promised ratepayers' bills would be frozen if his party comes to power in 2015.   "The squeeze in real incomes has made customers and voters much more sensitive to the impact of rising utility bills," Kemp writes. "And bills have risen so much for so long that increases are starting to spark public resistance." Some countries have already turned back to coal, the price of which has fallen because of the continent's struggling economy and the rise of natural gas in the U.S., which has boosted coal exports. European coal generation increased 6% in 2011 YOY and 2% in 2012 YOY. EIACoal use has unexpectedly jumped Of course, that negates the whole point of the climate change policies. So far, European countries have resisted ramping up their own shale extraction — fracking was just banned in France. Other countries are waiting to see how fracking fares in the U.K., where as we recently reported drilling has commenced in a town one hour south of London. And some, like the Poles, argue the higher costs are working as planned, since emissions are coming down. “Growth will return and the price will find its equilibrium again," the FT reported a Polish government memo as saying. "No administrative meddling is needed or else we might create the impression that such measures are standard practice.”

xcode / FlickrAll eyes are on the European Central Bank this week, with analysts expecting that the ECB will cut its benchmark refinancing rate by 25 basis-points. Weak inflation and unemployment data could spur the central bank to act, analysts say. For its part, the U.S. also saw its own "meh" inflation stats recently. Great, continue the trend! Consumer prices should fall, fall, fall. Make things cheaper! Not so fast. Even though we're still seeing mild inflation, the thinking above gets kicked around every so often, so it's worth remembering that "deflation" — when consumer prices are falling as opposed to rising — is not a good thing. Of course, it's inflation that's usually harangued as the greatest economic evil. We've seen inflation and not deflation in recent memory. Not to mention it bleeds our savings accounts and is criticized as a means by which governments erode debt over time.  But lower prices? Paul Krugman has a great explanation here of why that's a bad thing, the thought being that if prices are constantly dropping, consumers will delay spending. Why buy that F-150 today when it will be effectively "cheaper" next week? Here's Krugman: A second effect: even aside from expectations of future deflation, falling prices worsen the position of debtors, by increasing the real burden of their debts. Now, you might think this is a zero-sum affair, since creditors experience a corresponding gain. But as Irving Fisher pointed out long ago (pdf), debtors are likely to be forced to cut their spending when their debt burden rises, while creditors aren’t likely to increase their spending by the same amount. So deflation exerts a depressing effect on spending by raising debt burdens – which, as Fisher also points out, can lead to another kind of vicious circle, in which depressed spending because of rising real debt leads to further deflation. All of this spreads across the economy. When debtors, like companies, cut spending, revenues and profits go down which means job cuts and wage cuts. But since we're currently seeing "low" inflation as opposed to deflation, how does this apply? "Even with low but positive inflation the zero lower bound may be binding; inflation that comes in lower than borrowers expected leaves them with a worse debt burden than they were counting on, even if the inflation is positive; and since relative wages are shifting around all the time, some nominal wages will have to fall even if the overall rate of inflation is a bit above zero," Krugman writes.  "So the argument that deflation is a bad thing is also an argument saying that some economic problems get worse as inflation falls, and that too low an inflation rate may actually be economically damaging."
REUTERS/Brendan McDermidSpecialist trader Chris Malloy (C) gives a price to traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, October 18, 2013. In retrospect, it was a good idea to buy Amazon stock the day it went public. If you had invested $1,000 in Jeff Bezos' company then, you'd have earned $239,045 by now. It went public 16 years ago at $18 per share. Now Amazon is trading at $358 per share. How much money would you have made on eBay, Yahoo, Google, LinkedIn or Facebook's IPOs if you'd invested $1,000? Mashable and Statista figured it out.  Nothing beats an early $1,000 investment in Amazon, but if you had invested $1,000 in eBay the day it went public, you'd have almost $70,000 more now. If you had put the same amount in Yahoo, you'd have just over $60,000 more. An early $1,000 investment in Google would net you $12,072. LinkedIn's IPO would have given you about $5,000 by now. Facebook's would have you up, but only by about $1,300. Head over to Mashable to see the chart, which has been adjusted for splits and dividends.
Overnight, Bitcoin hit a new all-time high of $270, surpassing the peak price of $266 seen at the height of the Bitcoin mania in April. "Bitcoin is making a new high this week, breaking through the spiky bubble levels of April in a pretty controlled and orderly manner," writes ConvergEx Group chief market strategist Nick Colas in a note to clients this morning. "What gives?" bitcoin.clarkmoody.com In the note, Colas touches offers a few points on Bitcoin's second wind: The biggest Bitcoin exchange is now in China, displacing Japanese, American and European sources of demand. That enterprise is called BTC China, and its CEO Bobby Lee hails from Yahoo! and Walmart China. Oh, and he graduated from Stanford with a degree in Computer Science. In short, an apparently pretty clever fellow. Our sources in the Bitcoin community also agree that Second Market, the New York-based business best known for trading pre-IPO company stock, has become a major player in demand for Bitcoin. Earlier this year they started the Bitcoin Investment Trust, an open-ended product to buy and hold Bitcoins. Thereâ€™s no way to know how much Second Market has purchased on behalf of its clients, but it must be a popular offering â€“ the banner ad on their site for the trust occupied the top third of their front page. Itâ€™s not all been roses for Bitcoin, even in this recent run-up. Back in September computer science researchers from UC â€“ San Diego showed that it was actually fairly easy to track individual transactions in the bitcoin transaction ledger. Just this week, academics at Cornell proposed that bitcoin could eventually be co-opted by a handful of "Miners" who could hijack the system. Colas also chalks up part of the currency's resilience â€” why it's seemingly "minted on Teflon" â€” to its limited supply. "In the 4-ish minutes it has taken you to read this far, the most new Bitcoins that might have been issued is 25, or $6,250," he writes. "In the same timeframe, the Federal Reserve has pushed another $7.8 million into the financial system with Quantitative Easing."

There will be some ugly numbers in the October employment report to be released on Friday. The unemployment rate will probably increase sharply, and the number of part time workers for economic reasons will also increase. Excerpts from the BLS on the impact of the government shutdown: For October 2013, the household survey reference week was Sunday, October 6, through Saturday, October 12. During this period, some federal government agencies were closed or were operating at reduced staffing levels because of the lapse in their funding. The federal employees and contractors who work for those agencies may have been off work for all or part of the week. ... Workers who indicate that they were not working during the entire survey reference week and expected to be recalled to their jobs should be classified in the household survey as unemployed, on temporary layoff. Workers who usually work full time but indicate that they had worked fewer than 35 hours in the reference week because of the shutdown should be classified as employed part time for economic reasons. These shutdown related ugly numbers should be reversed in the November report (due early December). However the impact on the October establishment survey is less certain. The consensus forecast is for an increase of 120,000 non-farm payroll jobs in October, down from the 148,000 non-farm payroll jobs added in September. Here is a summary of recent data: • The ADP employment report showed an increase of 130,000 private sector payroll jobs in October. This was below expectations of 138,000 private sector payroll jobs added. The ADP report hasn't been very useful in predicting the BLS report for any one month. But in general, this suggests employment growth close to expectations. • The ISM manufacturing employment index decreased in October to 53.2% from 55.4% in September. A historical correlation between the ISM manufacturing employment index and the BLS employment report for manufacturing, suggests that private sector BLS manufacturing payroll jobs were mostly unchanged in October. The ADP report indicated a 5,000 increase for manufacturing jobs in October. The ISM non-manufacturing employment index increased in October to 56.2% from 52.7% in September. A historical correlation between the ISM non-manufacturing index and the BLS employment report for non-manufacturing, suggests that private sector BLS reported payroll jobs for non-manufacturing increased by about 235,000 in October. Taken together, these surveys suggest around 235,000 jobs added in October - well above the consensus forecast. • Initial weekly unemployment claims averaged close to 356,000 in October. This was up sharply from an average of 305,000 in September.  However there were some computer problems in California, and claims in September were probably too low - and claims in October too high.  So this might not be useful this month. • The final October Reuters / University of Michigan consumer sentiment index decreased to 73.2 from the September reading of 77.5. This is frequently coincident with changes in the labor market, but in this case the decline was probably related to the government shutdown. • The small business index  from Intuit showed a small decrease in small business employment in October.  • Conclusion: As usual the data was mixed. The ADP report was a little lower in October than in September, however the ISM surveys suggest an increase in hiring. Weekly claims for the reference week were higher (probably mostly due to computer issues), and consumer sentiment decreased (due to the government shutdown). There is always some randomness to the employment report - and there are reasons for pessimism (ADP, unemployment claims, consumer sentiment), however with so many questions about the data, I'll lean towards the ISM surveys and my guess is the BLS will report more than the 120,000 consensus jobs added in October.   There are many questions about this employment report because of the government shutdown, and the November report will be much more important.
(Reuters) - Uninsured Americans are showing more interest in the coverage offered under PresidentÂ Barack Obama's health care law despite technical problems that have hindered enrollment through a government website, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll. The glitches have crippled HealthCare.gov, the new online insurance marketplace meant to serve people in 36 states, frustrating millions of would-be applicants since it opened for enrollment on October 1. The poll's findings are good news for Obamacare supporters who worry the problems and bad press could dissuade people from signing up, particularly the young and healthy who are crucial to diversifying the pool of insured and keeping premiums down. The uninsured view the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, more favorably since online marketplaces opened - 44 percent compared with 37 percent in September, according to the Reuters/Ipsos poll. It found that 56 percent oppose the program compared with 63 percent in September. A higher proportion of the uninsured also said they are interested in buying insurance on the exchanges, with 42 percent in October, saying they were likely to enroll compared with 37 percent in September. The results have a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points. For a graphic, see: http://link.reuters.com/myw44v "The launch of the exchanges, that's the first real world event for a lot of people," saidÂ Chris Jackson, an Ipsos pollster. "There's been this sense that once people got familiar with it, public opinion would start to move in its direction." The online poll of nearly 12,000 people was conducted in October. Some 1,100 of the respondents identified themselves as uninsured. Among the general public, support for the law rose from nearly 44 percent to 47 percent, with a credibility interval of 1 percentage point, according to the poll. The non-partisanÂ Congressional Budget OfficeÂ estimates that up to 7 million people are likely to sign up for coverage on the private exchanges for 2014, but that number has been called into question due to HealthCare.gov's problems. TheÂ Obama administrationÂ has said it is working around the clock to fix theÂ websiteÂ by the end of November. The results showed that the rise in both the law's popularity and in the uninsured's willingness to buy was much greater in the 14 states that chose to run their own exchanges and whose sites have generally operated more smoothly than HealthCare.gov, which serves the other 36 states. More than half of respondents in state-run exchanges now favor the law compared with about four in 10 elsewhere. To the uninsured the faultyÂ websiteÂ is "a technical barrier that is being repaired and it pales to barriers they've faced in the past," saidÂ Sara Collins, vice president at theÂ Commonwealth Fund, a private health care research foundation. The law bans insurers from discriminating against those with pre-existing conditions and provides subsidies to help low-to-middle income Americans buy private insurance. TheÂ Congressional Budget OfficeÂ has projected it will cut the uninsured population by half, or about 25 million people, in the next decade. Melissa Harvey, an asthmatic who spends $500 per month on prescription medicines, has been seeking insurance for five years. The 37-year-old has been without coverage since she lost her job as a public defender and moved back toÂ ColoradoÂ to start a private law practice. "I wish the plans were cheaper," Harvey said of the insurance offered onÂ Colorado's state-run exchange. "But at the same time, the plans I am looking at would be less per month than what I'm paying in prescription costs." At the same time, news reports about HealthCare.gov's struggles have keptÂ Amanda WoodÂ from visiting the site to check out health plans inÂ New Jersey. Wood, 25, said the problems remind her of frustrations trying to register electronically for classes when she was in college. "It's a hugeÂ website," Wood said. "I would just prefer to wait until it's working." Among the majority of uninsured Americans surveyed in the poll who said they oppose the law, many resent its requirement to buy coverage or face a fine. "I don't believe the government should have to tell me I have to buy any insurance," saidÂ Joshua LucasÂ ofÂ Arizona, a stay-at-home father of two. "I'm 34 years old, and I am in great health, so I don't feel like I have to have it."

REUTERS/Ahmed JadallahLabourers work near the Burj Khalifa, the tallest tower in the world, in Dubai May 9, 2013. LONDON (Reuters) - Three years ago, a trip to theÂ Southern KenyaÂ production facilities of Canadian companyÂ Africa OilÂ attracted only seven potential investors. Two months ago, 60 boarded the flight. The investor trip, described by sales staff at Citi following a recent client conference, is just one illustration of the swelling interest in the most esoteric frontier markets. In a world of low yields and paltry growth, the attraction of frontier markets - the lesser developed emerging markets inÂ Africa,Â Asia,Â Europe, theÂ Middle EastÂ andÂ Latin AmericaÂ - is pretty clear. Juicy returns, often huge natural resources and young populations provide a stark contrast to the ageing economic profile in the West. "Everyone and his dog seems to know something about (frontier markets) now," Citi wrote. And yet, like many small, illiquid and often opaque markets, there's a problem. The surge in interest may already be in the price. Frontier market stocks have outridden a slump in broader emerging markets this year, with help from long-term investors. Stars includeÂ Nigeria'sÂ Dangote Cement, up 48 percent, andÂ Dubai's Emaar Properties, up 61 percent. But these countries' restrictively tiny markets and increasingly pricey stocks are starting to dent their appeal. "My best-performing stock this year has been a Nigerian cement company. Is that likely to be the case next year? I doubt it,"Â Richard Titherington, CIO of emerging equities at JP Morgan Asset Management, told a recent media briefing. "You need to be careful about being too optimistic about frontier markets," he added, saying he preferred emerging market companies which paid strong dividends, for example. One critical warning signal has been the crossover in valuations between frontier and emerging markets. Frontier companies are traditionally seen as cheap because of the perception of the high risks involved in buying them. But frontier market valuations have become more expensive than emerging markets, at around 13 times earnings, for the first time in nearly two years. (For GRAPHIC, see http://link.reuters.com/maq93v) Some stock markets may be close to the top of their game, withÂ DubaiÂ andÂ KenyaÂ near five-year highs. HSBC emerging equity analystÂ John LomaxÂ last week downgradedÂ KenyaÂ to neutral. "The market has already run up aggressively and...valuations are beginning to look somewhat expensive," he wrote in a client note. Individual valuations in some cases look alarming. Nestle NigeriaÂ has a price/earnings ratio of 40 times, and its 12-month forward PE ratio is at 33, well above its peers, according to Reuters Eikon data. Another concern is that these markets' small size will struggle to attract new money, with investors finding it difficult to enter the markets without influencing prices. Templeton Emerging Markets Group, which has $3 billion under management in its frontiers strategy, closed its frontiers fund to new investors earlier this year. Templeton's role is huge in an asset class where many funds total $100 million or less. The market capitalisation of the closely-watched MSCI frontiers index is only $130 billion, compared with $3.8 trillion for the emerging markets index, or more than $15 trillion for the S&amp;P 500. "Frontier markets have had a good run, they have outperformed, but at the end of the day it's a considerably smaller universe than emerging markets," saidÂ Maria Gratsova, emerging equities strategist at Citi. The MSCI emerging stock index is in the red for the year on weak earnings growth and fears about a reduction in risk-supporting U.S. monetary stimulus. The MSCI frontiers index, in contrast, has climbed 20 percent, in line with moves in developed stocks. But the frontiers rally masks wide disparities, in market size and performance, with some countries posting losses. BulgariaÂ and theÂ UAEÂ are top-performing markets, and off-index playsÂ Saudi ArabiaÂ andÂ IraqÂ have also soared. ButÂ LebanonÂ andÂ JordanÂ - down 0.5 and 0.1 percent respectively, and weaker in dollar terms - have suffered from their proximity toÂ Syria. Away from the index,Â MongoliaÂ has dropped nearly 20 percent, with investors deterred earlier this year by restrictive foreign investment laws. The MSCI index of 26 countries contains a mix of markets. KuwaitÂ has a 23 percent weighting, while energy-producing markets United Arab Emirates andÂ QatarÂ together make up 30 percent. The bias towards these markets makes benchmarking to the index more difficult, potentially adding investment risk. "We are never going to have a 50-60 percent weighting in countries in the Gulf region," saidÂ Andrew Brudenell, frontier fund manager atÂ HSBC Asset Management, which uses a customized MSCI index to match its investment strategy more closely. Other indices, such as those compiled by S&amp;P and FTSE, contain different markets or have a wider range of countries. But the larger number of countries can also lead to smaller size and liquidity in each, analysts say, and the indices all use similar market capitalisation criteria which give heavy weighting to only a few markets. Frontier investors say, however, that despite the difficulties of investing, their markets are enjoying a well-deserved catch-up after lagging emerging markets in 2009 and 2010, and they are confident of longer-term gains. Veteran investor Mark Mobius, Templeton Emerging Markets executive chairman, has large holdings inÂ Nigeria and saysÂ Africa, for example, holds out a lot of investment hope. "The number of people who have bank accounts is very, very tiny, the growth prospects are very, very good - the future isÂ Africa." (Additional reporting by Joel Dimmock; Editing by Peter Graff)
REUTERS/Esam Omran Al-FetoriDemonstrators block a road near the scene of a car bomb explosion near a school where a training workshop for municipal council elections was being held, in Benghazi October 26, 2013.TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Payments problems, chaos and corruption are hampering Libyan importers from making big deals to buy wheat, another setback as the country spins out of control two years after dictator Muammar Gaddafi was toppled by rebels and NATO warplanes. In the latest disruption, the biggest wheat importer Mahatan Tripoli, which supplies most of the capital's bread, says it may have to put off its next major wheat purchase unless the state starts paying it nearly $100 million owed for previous imports. For months, rogue militia members have disrupted Libya's oil exports, the main source of funding for a state that feeds its six million people with subsidized bread handed out for as little as 2 U.S. cents a loaf. There are no signs of food shortages - quite the opposite: bread is still plentiful and cheap. But global grain traders say big Libyan buyers are now having difficulty arranging import deals. Exporters abroad are worried about being paid on time, and about the additional risks of unloading ships in chaotic ports where armed militia members run rampant. The chairman of Matahan Tripoli, which buys wheat on international markets and sells flour and other processed foods to the state's subsidized distribution system, said the government owed it $96.7 million. "If we don't get paid within two weeks then we don't have the funds to open new credit letters and make purchases again," Mustafa Abdel-Majid Idris told Reuters. Without the state funds, the formerly state-owned milling firm would have to delay an order of 50,000 tonnes of wheat, intended to help feed the capital for three months, Idris said. The Libyan government insists the country will not have trouble financing its imports. Economy Minister Mustafa Abu Fanas told Reuters Libya would sort out any tender problems of private importers. "We monitor and control the private sector if there are any problems to facilitate trade exchange through our economic relations...and fix some problems imports face," he said. But in a country where the prime minister was abducted last month by gun-toting militia members, the government's ability to deliver on its promises is always in doubt. Under a system that has grown far less centralized since the civil war that toppled Gaddafi, Libya's state no longer imports huge quantities of wheat itself, but instead mostly pays for around 35 private milling firms to do the importing. The largest is Matahan Tripoli, which was owned by the state under Gaddafi and milled about 40 percent of Libya's imported wheat, supplying the capital with pasta, semolina, animal feed and other products as well as flour for subsidized bakeries. It is now a private firm. Idriss said the government had promised to pay for private companies to import even more wheat than usual this year and was now having difficulty meeting those pledges. "They opened many credit letters because they were worried people might be dying of hunger," he said. "Now the state is obliged to pay what it has contracted... It now faces difficulties to solve the problem." He said the rise in the number of contracted tenders would force the government to spend some 1.5 billion Libyan dinars ($1.21 billion) on bread subsidies this year, 500 million dinars more than it usually pays. Foreign trade and shipping sources say some exporters have become more reluctant to deal with Libya. Cargoes shipped to Libya have been smaller sized in recent months. "The overall climate there is chaotic. You are seeing more wariness from the international trade to get involved in commodities deals," said a Middle East-based trade source. "There are also payment issues and letters of credit are taking a long time to be opened. There is also the country risk and the discharge and demurrage risk," the Middle East trade source said. Demurrage refers to costs that shippers can face if unloading cargo is unexpectedly delayed. Since Gaddafi was deposed in the only one of the "Arab Spring" revolts that drew in major Western military involvement, Libya's central government has failed to tame rogue militias or bring security to the country. Unlike poorer Arab states that saw revolts in 2011, Libya's oil wealth allows it to guarantee a decent quality of life to most of its comparatively small population. But it also means the public depends on the unraveling state for food and jobs. The situation worsened sharply this summer when militias managed to block most oil exports at ports, cutting off the government's main source of revenue. While the central bank has built up sizable reserves from oil sales, Prime Minister Ali Zeidan said last month the opposition in parliament was deliberately blocking budget payments in a bid to bring down his government. A European trader said he believed Libya still had enough funds to pay for food imports, but corruption and confusion were making it impossible to strike big deals. "I think the problems are with the governmental chaos and the rising corruption this is in turn creating rather than lack of money. I think money is available but the government is hardly functioning in some regions and cannot pay it out. "The lack of supervision and uncertainty means corruption is becoming endemic. It is a nightmare trying to do business with the government." Another European trader said the situation appeared to be more difficult in western Libya near the capital Tripolithan in the east, where the main mill for the city of Benghazi succeeded in buying 50,000 tonnes of wheat last week. "In my view the Tripoli agencies are almost at a standstill. The Benghazi agency did buy 50,000 tonnes of wheat but naturally there are concerns it will actually be paid for. I would expect the Benghazi agency to pay." Ultimately, Libya's government may have to wean the public off such lavish subsidies, which provide bread so cheaply that the authorities believe 40 percent of it is simply wasted. Forty bread loaves cost only as much as a single can of Coca-Cola. Libyans sometimes feed bread to their animals. Much of it is tossed in the bin. "Few people buy fewer than ten loaves," said Massoud Gampalo, who runs a busy Tripoli bakery, describing customers who load up plastic bags with cheap bread. While he was talking a customer stuffed some 50 small baguettes into a box. Libya imported a staggering 1.8 million tonnes of wheat last year - nearly six kilos per person per week. Data from the International Grains Council predicts imports falling slightly to 1.7 million tonnes this year. Some of the subsidized wheat is diverted through corruption or smuggled to neighboring countries for sale at market prices. In a desert country with only a small strip of fertile land along the coast, domestic production is meager. It is expected to total just 100,000 tonnes this year, down from 260,000 in 2010, largely due to power cuts and damage to machinery from the 2011 war, said Ali Ahmed Ruhuma, head of the wheat production authority.

REUTERSA worker wields a hammer at a demolition site in front of new residential buildings in Hefei, Anhui province, October 19, 2013.BEIJING (Reuters) - In defying four years of official cooling efforts, China's soaring house prices reveal an uncomfortable truth: government is one of the biggest obstacles to the success of taming the market. State income is so entwined in the need for rising land prices that policy efforts to try to curb the house market create an inherent conflict of interest. With one hand on a patchwork of controls aimed at taming record house prices, governments with their other hand are at the same time selling land to developers at rising prices. Homes in cities such as Beijing are more expensive by some measures than Britain or Japan, a dismal outcome for a central government campaign aimed at making homes more affordable to Chinese. House prices in September rose nationwide at their fastest pace in three years. "The starting point of local governments is to keep land prices relatively high," said Zou Xiaoyun, deputy chief engineer at China Land Surveying and Planning Institute, a research unit affiliated to the land ministry. "Governments are not willing to see home prices fall." Selling land is a major source of income for local governments but other factors drive up prices as well. These include natural demand from a rising population, and speculation fuelled by ready cash, given relatively few alternatives for investment. China's reform efforts, such as lowering government reliance on land sales for revenue and providing speculators with more investment options, should help iron out these factors. A meeting starting on Saturday of the country's top leaders will give clues about those reform plans. Nowhere in China is the problem of a surging property market more acute than in Beijing and Shanghai, where the lure of good education and employment have underpinned demand as millions of Chinese are encouraged to migrate to cities. Beijing prices are the steepest in the country. A 70-square-metre home costs 20 times annual household disposable income, the International Monetary Fund said in a 2011 report, four times higher than in Britain and double Japan. Shanghai's price-to-income ratio is around 14 times. Lu Biao, a 27-year-old IT engineer who works in Beijing, is buying his first home in nearby Tianjin, a 30-minute express train ride from Beijing. The 100-square-metre apartment will cost him about a million yuan. "Beijing's home prices are too expensive and are always rising," said Lu, whose annual income is around 150,000 yuan. "If I don't buy a house now, I will never be able to buy one." To be sure, the central government faces a dilemma. Rising discontent over house prices is a threat to the social and economic stability the Communist Party uses as justification for its one-party rule. But the real estate sector is also a major economic driver, supporting some 40 other industries and generating about 16 percent of the country's $8.5 trillion GDP. That has been important this year in supporting economic growth, which is expected to droop to a 23-year-low of 7.5 percent this year. And it is a major source of income for local governments, so if the central government clamped down too hard, it would cause problems for city authorities. Beijing's government has sold 14.9 million square meters of land in the first 10 months this year, more than during all of 2012, Reuters calculations of official data show. Its revenues from land sales have doubled to 120 billion yuan this year from last year's 65 billion yuan, the calculations show. That's the fastest growth in at least six years and a boon when other sources of fiscal revenues are withering. Prices of new homes in Beijing rose 16 percent in September from a year earlier, data shows, compared with the national average of 9 percent. Price increases were even steeper elsewhere; 17 percent in Shanghai and about 20 percent in southern Guangzhou and Shenzhen. "Land prices are rising so property prices will rise. A rising tide lifts all boats," said a senior executive at a mid-sized listed property developer in Beijing. He declined to be named as he is not authorized to speak to the media. Beijing city authorities said they had taken several measures to stabilize land prices, including increasing supply and capping winning bids in land auctions, the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Land and Resources said. "We have resolutely enforced central government's macro-economy controls to maintain a healthy, orderly and stable land market in Beijing," the land bureau said in a statement to Reuters. Beijing's efforts are reflected nationally. The central government has waged a four-year campaign of restricting purchases, demanding higher down payments and curtailing bank lending to try to cool the market. Nearly 80 percent of Beijing's new homes are being built in 10 new towns on the edges of Beijing, consultant HomeLink says. Typical is Daxing, an hour's subway ride south of the city centre where apartment blocks are being built over former watermelon farms. Prices are soaring. Apartments in the Gold Fragrance Town compound sold for 11,000 yuan per square meter in 2010 after developers bought the land for 4,675 yuan in 2007, public records show. Since then, prices have doubled. Apartments launched this month in the nearby Prosperous and Happy Spring estate, a joint development between Poly Real Estate &lt;600048.SS&gt; and Beijing Capital Development Co Ltd &lt;600376.SS&gt;, are going for 23,000 yuan per square meter. The developers bought the land in September 2012 for 7,070 yuan per square meter, public records show. Prices could double again. Poly and Beijing Capital jointly bought land in south Daxing in May at a record price of 18,870 yuan per square meter, Chinese newspaper Securities Daily said. Assuming land accounts for 50 percent of the final sales price and allowing for a profit margin of around 35 percent, which developers use as a gauge, the apartments are likely to sell for at least 38,000 yuan per square meter. Land prices are also rising elsewhere. The Yiwu government in south China raised eye brows in October after it allowed a land auction to fail because the highest bid missed its preferred price, Chinese media said. Across China, governments' land revenues galloped 50 percent from a year earlier to 2.7 trillion yuan in the first nine months of this year, Finance Ministry data shows. "Rising home prices are not uncontrollable, but they are not under control," said Cao Jianhai, an economist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a top state think-tank. Chinese home buyers appear to agree. After waiting in vain for prices to fall, many do not want to wait any longer, releasing pent up demand that partly explains September's spurt in prices. In south Daxing, a retiree said she had waited since January for a good time to buy a flat for her married son. She now thinks it is futile to hold back. "It's not possible to wait. The longer you wait, the higher prices go," she said as she scurried between home showrooms. (Editing by Neil Fullick)
APGoldman's Alec Phillips writes in a note to clients that the odds of Congress reaching some kind of "small bargain" are on the rise. It's way too hopeful to imagine that Congress in this environment would ever be able to reach a broad deal on spending, entitlement, and taxes. But, says Phillips, there's a decent and growing chance that Congress will agree to prevent another set of spending cuts from coming into force in 2014. See, current law ("The Sequester") envisions another $19 billion in annual spending cuts starting next year. Phillips thinks those can be reversed for a few reasons. One key thing is that the cuts will primarily fall on defense spending in 2014, which could increase GOP motivation to reverse them. The dollar amounts are small. To maintain the current (smaller) sequester cut for another year, lawmakers will probably need to agree on $19bn in offsetting savings elsewhere in the budget. These savings could be spread over ten years and could be found through a variety of smaller policy changes. While it seems that nothing is easy in Washington these days, finding $19bn in a budget projected to take in $40 trillion and spend $47 trillion over the next ten years should be easier to resolve than a lot of other problems before Congress. A small deal could sidestep the tax vs. spending issue that has blocked so many prior agreements. Prior broad fiscal negotiations have gotten hung up on tax increases (Republicans generally oppose them) and entitlement spending cuts (Democrats generally oppose them unless coupled with tax increases). A small deal could might skip both sets of issues and instead focus on spending that does not affect entitlement benefit and revenue that does not affect the tax code (for example by raising user fees). For example, the farm bill alone, versions of which have passed the House and Senate, would reduce spending by a projected $20bn to $30bn over the next 10 years. Defense cuts are likely to increase motivation to reach a deal. Due to quirks in the law, the cuts fell more heavily on non-defense spending in FY2013, and but will fall equally on defense and non-defense spending in 2014. The upshot is that almost the entire incremental cut for 2014 applies to defense. This may increase Republican interest in an agreement. On this last point, the initial hope when the sequester was put into place in 2011 was that the GOP would find the defense cuts to be so odious that they would be eager to remove the sequester entirely, but that didn't pan out. The pro-defense hawkish element within the GOP who really care about this stuff aren't as big of a force as they used to be, and the party was happy to leave in place all the cuts. That being said, if the majority of cuts in 2014 fall upon defense, maybe the party will be more inclined to do something. At least that's Phillips' reasoning.
While the US housing market remains relatively robust, it is likely to face a couple of headwinds going forward. One is the lower affordability index, which is declining due to higher prices and higher mortgage rates (see discussion). On a year-over-year basis the declines have been quite steep. The second trend that will detract from demand for homes is the recent slowdown in net household formation. The chart below shows the year-over-year change in total number of US households. This decline in the "formation rate" is likely to be transient (simply because of population growth), but it is not helpful for the housing market nevertheless. FRED SoberLook
TOKYO (AP) â€” Toyota's quarterly profit surged 70 percent as a weaker Japanese yen and cost cuts helped offset a slight decline in vehicle sales. Toyota Motor Corp. said Wednesday its July-September net profit rose to 438.4 billion yen ($4.4 billion) from 257.9 billion yen a year earlier. The Tokyo-based maker of the Prius and Camry raised its earnings forecast for the fiscal year ending March 2014 to 1.67 trillion yen ($16.9 billion). But it kept its sales forecast at 9.1 million vehicles, anticipating that higher than expected sales in Japan, North America and Europe will be countered by decrease in sales in Asia. The company raised its capital spending plans by 20 billion yen ($203 million) to 940 billion yen ($9.5 billion). Quarterly sales slipped to 2.24 million vehicles from 2.25 million vehicles a year earlier. Toyota last month said its global sales for the first nine months of the year totaled 7.41 million vehicles, little changed from the previous year but outpacing General Motors to keep its lead as the world's top-selling automaker. GM lost the global sales throne to Toyota for the first time in 2008 but retook the crown in 2011, when Toyota's plants were slowed by an earthquake and tsunami in northeastern Japan that damaged suppliers of parts. Toyota recovered the lead last year. While rivals GM and Germany's Volkswagen AG have been growing in China, Toyota's sales have suffered from anti-Japanese sentiment that flared up last year over territorial disputes. Toyota's growth has come largely from the popularity of the Camry, Corolla and Tundra in the U.S. The company's sales number includes heavy trucks made by Toyota's group company Hino Motors, so the competition is hotter when such models, which GM lacks, are excluded from Toyota's tally. The revival of U.S. automakers and strong line-ups from European and other Asian car makers present a challenge to Toyota, said Karl Brauer, senior analyst for Kelly Blue Book. "This increased global competition means increased pressure on Toyota to introduce new and better products while controlling costs and maintaining profitability," he said in a commentary. Toyota's president Akio Toyoda has stressed the company's determination to avoid any quality lapses similar to those that led to a massive recall fiasco in the U.S. that came on the heels of the financial crisis. The weakening of the Japanese yen over the past year has played a huge role in the company's improved profitability, while drawing complaints from its rivals. Toyota calculated its revenues and income using an exchange rate of 99 yen per U.S. dollar in April-September of this year, compared with 79 yen per dollar last year. It gained 280 billion yen ($2.8 billion) in net income from foreign exchange effects. Toyota Executive Vice President Nobuyori Kodaira said the automaker will focus on improving its cost controls and profit per vehicle. Profit rose 83 percent in the first half of the fiscal year to 1 trillion yen ($10.1 billion). Copyright (2013) Associated Press. All rights reserved.

This is just amazing. Bitcoin continues to make a moonshot. Now it's above $260, near all-time highs. Here's a map showing it's now about where it was this spring, during the peak of the last mania. From Clarkmoody: Clarkmoody
prb10111 / FlickrOh look. Stocks are up again. The can't-lose market continues to go higher and higher with markets gaining pretty much everywhere. In Japan last night, the Nikkei rallied 0.8%, helped by an increase in the outlook at Toyota. European stocks are up across the board, in part thanks to decent service PMI numbers. And in the US, futures are up around 0.4%. We're coming upon the busy part of the week. Tomorrow we get an ECB meeting and of course Friday we get the Octobers Jobs Report.
