Elon Musk did not join Tesla Motors, take the helm as CEO, and pour hefty amounts of his own cash into the company with the hope of getting money back, he said Wednesday night at the Wall Street Journal's D: All Things Digital Conference. "The reason for Tesla is not because I wanted to get a return on investment," he said. "Today we’ve got quite a high market cap, so it may seem obviously a good thing to have done, but for many years people regarded this as stupid or insane or both." After eBay bought PayPal, which Musk helped created, for $1.2 billion in 2002, Musk did not want to start another internet company, which would have been as easy as "falling off a log." Musk wanted to build an electric car, he said at the conference, to address rising gasoline prices.  "The reason for Tesla was to create a compelling long-range electric car that people would buy." He has not been swayed by doubters of his cause. "If I had a dollar for every time someone brought up Delorean or Tucker [both failed small-scale auto companies] I wouldn’t need to IPO." Whatever his original intentions were, Musk has put Tesla Motors in a good position, especially in recent weeks. This month, the electric car company has landed an incredible Consumer Reports review of its Model S, announced its first profitable quarter, and paid off its federal loan nine years early. Musk also announced the dramatic expansion of Tesla's Supercharger network Wednesday night, saying a Model S owner will be able to drive from Los Angeles to New York by the end of this year.
Memorial Day weekend kicks off the summer season in sunny destinations across the country as city dwellers and others seek to escape the heat and enjoy some natural beauty and relaxation. But like unwanted guests crowding a cabin or a cottage, a lot of unwelcome events that impact the markets can really ruin a summer vacation. So far, however, the calendar for investors appears clear of major events until the end of the summer and beginning of fall. These end-of-summer/beginning-of-fall events include: These events have the potential to lead to a change in the investment environment and alter the course of the markets.  But how do you invest over the next few months leading up to these events—in other words, what investments do you rent for the summer? Summer rentals for your portfolio may include: While unscheduled events may arise and alter the investing environment this summer, it may be that the next major event is not until around the end of the summer. While it can be hard work and what may be perfect for you may not be right for someone else, finding your perfect summer rental can be well worth the effort.
REUTERS/Jason ReedAustan GoolsbeeBen Bernanke's term as Chairman of the Federal Reserve ends on January 31, 2014.Â  While he could stick around for another term, most Fed-watchers think it's unlikely. "[I]t has not been an easy eight years and the magnitude of the role in the post-crisis world has certainly grown," says UBS's Drew Matus. "His decision to skip the Fed Conference at Jackson Hole and to give the commencement address at Princeton both suggest that he is preparing for retirement." Matus thinks there's a solid 80% chance that Bernanke steps down.Â  With that in mind, he offers is list of leading candidates to take the chair. The probabilities were based on a poll conducted within UBS's economics department (i.e. Maury Harris, Drew Matus, Sam Coffin, and Kevin Cummins). All six leading candidates hold a PhD in economics. Other candidates with less than 5% probability included Lawrence Summers, Peter Fisher, William Dudley, Jeremy Stein, Timothy Geithner, Donald Kohn, Stanley Fischer, Eric Rosengren, James Bullard, and James Stock.

Joe Raedle/Getty ImagesU.S. foreclosure inventory, which refers to properties in some stage of foreclosure, equaled 1.1 million in April, according to CoreLogic's latest report. This was down 24% from 1.5 million a year ago. It was also down 2 percent from March. Foreclosure inventory represented 2.8% of all homes with a mortgage, compared with 3.5% a year ago. Meanwhile, there were 52,000 completed foreclosures in April, the same as March. But this was down from 62,000 a year ago. Before the housing bust, completed foreclosures averaged about 21,000 a month. Home prices have been boosted by tight supply, especially a decline in the stock of distressed properties. "Fewer distressed properties combined with improving home prices and a pickup in home purchases are significant signals that the ongoing recovery in the housing and mortgage markets continues to gather steam," said Anand Nallathambi, president of CoreLogic in a press release. Here are some details from the report: Here's a look at foreclosure inventory by state: CoreLogic
With limited growth prospects and interest rates near record lows, many companies have been borrowing money to buyback massive amounts of their outstanding shares. Just last month, Apple announced it would tap the bond markets to finance a $50 billion expansion to its stock buyback plan. For investors looking at earnings per share, these buybacks lower share counts, effectively accelerating EPS growth while net income growth may be more modest. Below is a chart of buyback announcements via Deutsche Bank's "Equity House View" report. "Buyback announcements over the past 3 months total a record $214bn, or double the quarterly pace of actual repurchases (~$100bn)," write the analysts. Some of that is due to Apple. Regardless, that's a lot of stock being pulled out of the market. Deutsche Bank
AP Photo/Paul SakumaTesla's stock is up 208% year to date. The green automaker has had a great first quarter. It reported its first ever quarterly profit and has been dubbed America's fourth automaker. Donn Vickrey at Gradient Analytics agrees that Elon Musk and his team have created a good product. But he isn't buying the recent hype. "Thus far, the companyâ€™s results have been driven by nonrecurring boosts and accounting gimmicks, all of which are either unsustainable or purely cosmetic," he wrote in a note earlier this month. He gave the company's earnings an 'F.' Vickrey's main concerns are: Here is an excerpt from our interview with Vickrey: Business Insider: A lot of people have turned bullish on Tesla. What are they missing? Don Vickrey: There's been a lot of irrational exuberance about an unproven technology. What's unproven about it is on the revenue side â€” what's unproven is the true level of demand for the car. In the most recent quarter they outsold all other comparable luxury cars â€” comparable in terms of price â€” and the demand for luxury cars is something that is fairly stable across time. It may go up or down slightly depending on the economy and such, but the spike in demand that we saw recently was what we called pent up demand. ... Then my expectation is that the demand doesn't stay at the same level; it's primarily a function of price. It's a very expensive car. They don't really have anything comparable to a Nissan Leaf or a Toyota Prius that they can sell to more average, middle class customers. Right now we're seeing sales [due to] pent-up demand for a niche product, a very expensive car that appeals to a specific type of customer who views themselves as being either cutting edge or green; one of the above. I seriously doubt the demand will continue. That's kind of the top line. BI: What about costs? DV: On the cost side, people are willing to ignore that as long as the demand appears to be there. Costs of their businesses are also extremely problematic. If you take out the zero emission vehicles (ZEV) credits, they've never made a profit, and in the most recent quarter they got $68 million from these credits. You back that out and they've got a massive loss again. They've already said they have to wean themselves off these credits and that their ability to sell them is going to diminish relatively quickly. At least what they're saying is that they don't expect much of any by the end of the year. That they believe they can make a 25% gross margin just doesn't add up. ...Their ability to stick to that number, at such low volumes, is very unlikely. BI: And the rate of warranty accruals? DV: I don't believe that they're doing sufficient warranties right now. And right now their warranty accrual is about the same as Ford or GM. What's problematic about it is it's very new technology. Ford and GM by and large are selling at very established platforms and very established technologies. The incremental change from one year to the next in terms of technology is not that large, whereas Tesla really has no idea. There's a point in time â€” it's 10 years if I'm right â€” where they've guaranteed the owners a battery replacement, but they have accrued nowhere near enough to replace batteries, for those that need batteries. Not even remotely close. They have a similar problem going forward on the Model S. They haven't guaranteed a replacement but they are, if after eight years or 125,000 miles it remains to be seen ... the cost of those things is exorbitant. â€¦It would be like Ford or GM saying we're going to guarantee you a new engine at the end of a period of time. That would be very expensive. That causes your warranty costs to go up significantly. ... Plus you've got a completely new car. When you introduce a new car even Ford or GM has to have a higher expected warranty expense for brand new platforms, brand new cars, because the first model of a car has far more defects than, say, later on down the line when they become more efficient, more effective, quality-controlled. Yet none of that is reflected in the financials. The bottom-line: Without the ZEV credits and what I think would be a more reasonable accrual they basically have no gross margin. BI: How much of the accounting gimmickry is a function of the company trying to hide losses versus just being a very young company taking advantage of accounting tricks?  DV: I don't think there is any relationship between the age of a company and the use of lenient accounting.Â  According to accounting research, the primary motives for earnings management are management pay/tenure (which is often a function of earnings and/or share price) and the need for capital (either to meet existing debt covenants or raise additional debt or equity capital). Another factor may also be poor internal controls.BI: Do you think Tesla's going to fail? DV: I wouldn't want to speculate on whether or not Tesla is going to fail. Elon Musk and his team are very talented and they have produced what appears to be very good product from what I can tell. That said, the cost is exorbitant and affordable by only the one-percenters of the world. I don't see how you can stay in business selling electric cars to one-percenters. So ultimately the question will be, can they build a car that is affordable to the average buyer before they run out of capital? Will the market continue to value shares high enough to fund the next capital raise? And the one after that? Until that question is answered, I think shares are terribly overvalued. Call it irrational exuberance, much like we saw during the Internet and telecom booms. BI: So what are they doing right? DV: It's a double-edged sword, because it's going back to the warranty issue, but they're taking really good care of their customers. For example one person I spoke to said they had a windshield crack and the insurance company said the cost is going to be around $1,000 and Tesla stepped up and said they would replace it under warranty. That's really good customer service. But what's a little concerning is that it also affects that warranty issue. It's the right way to go by instilling confidence in the brand, by providing superb customer service, which they seem to be doing. The performance of the car I think is really good. How it performs as the battery starts to age and so forth remains to be seen. But I think in the segment they are in, they're producing a good product. BI: Anything else our readers should know? DV: Another concern I think people need to be thinking about going forward is they'reÂ  guaranteeing the residual value on cars that are leased going forward. That can create some real headaches, because residual values are such an unknown at this point. And if they're guaranteeing a relatively high residual value, which they need to do to make the car more affordable, on the back end they could be stuck with a lot of vehicles that have far less residual value than what they've estimated. Depending on how many people take that lease option it's also going to cause some issues with regard to how they go about measuring their profit because right now its just their vehicles sold and the selling price is your revenue, whereas anything that is effectively leased under this new arrangement you just get periodic payments coming in that count towards your revenue. ...This is going to cause slower growth in revenue."

REUTERS/Mark BlinchTesla Motors CEO Elon Musk.Tesla Motors has accomplished many remarkable things in its short life as a startup maker of electric cars. But, to clear up a common misperception, its supporters should understand that it has not--yet--made a profit in its core business: designing, building, and selling the Model S all-electric luxury sport sedan. The confusion seems to have come about because Tesla Motors [NSDQ:TSLA] reported a profitable first quarter, to the surprise of many and the elation of its shareholders. It also took advantage a classic "short squeeze" in its stock to raise more than $1 billion in fresh equity, and used some of that money to pay off its entire low-interest loan from the U.S. Department of Energy. But back to those Q1 financials: The company reported net income of $11 million on total revenue of $562 million. Tesla was profitable because it earned $68 million from selling Zero-Emission Vehicle credits (which it earns under California state laws governing vehicle emissions) to other automakers, and a further $17 million from selling Greenhouse Gas emission credits. It also logged $11 million in warrant liability reversals, along with $7 million in foreign currency adjustments. Take away the revenue sources that are a byproduct of Model S sales--both enabled by legislation, as a testy OpEd in the Wall Street Journal points out--and the financial adjustments, and the company lost $91 million on building and selling its cars (along with building and selling powertrains for so-called compliance cars to other automakers as well). On the Q1 earnings call, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and CFO Deepak Ahuja said that its financial planning assumes that revenue from selling emission credits would fall to zero by the end of the year, although it was possible that the number could be higher. The pair also described the steps the company is taking to reduce the staff hours and parts costs that go into building a Model S. Now that parts vendors are starting to believe that Tesla is actually building the volumes it claimed it would--perhaps 21,000 this year, against the 3,000 one vendor supposedly tooled up for--the  company will benefit from economies of scale that drive down parts prices. It's also steadily cutting the number of worker hours that go into each car. The problem is that these cost reductions don't show up in the financials until the cars they apply to have been sold--and financials are only reported every three months, per SEC rules. So, Tesla suggests that Model S cars sold in the second and third quarters should have a lower Cost Of Goods Sold. That's how you get to profitability. The company just didn't quite make it there in Q1. Here endeth today's lesson on accounting for carmakers. Follow GreenCarReports on Facebook, Twitter and Google+.
U.S. Treasury bonds are the biggest safe-haven investment on the globe. Treasuries are how the U.S. borrows money, and since the U.S. has its own currency, the prospect of a default on those bonds is viewed as a virtual impossibility. So when times get bad, investors tend to pile into Treasuries, driving prices up and bond yields down. When times get good, people feel less inclined to be in safe-haven assets, and yields go up. The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond bottomed out in July 2012, and since then, it's been a steady grind higher â€“ up until a few weeks ago, when things really started getting going and yields surged upward. Business Insider/Matthew Boesler, data from Bloomberg Midway through last summer, the stock market was rebounding from a bit of a soft patch in the United States, and across the Atlantic, the euro crisis was perceived as the biggest risk to global markets as Spanish and Italian government bond yields were once again rising to levels that were making government borrowing costs unsustainable. The first big change that shook up the status quo gripping global markets at the time and reversed the course of Treasury yields was European Central Bank President Mario Draghi's now-famous speech in late July of last year in which he declared that the ECB was ready to "do whatever it takes to save the euro." Since then, the deteriorating economic situation in Europe has decoupled with stock and bond markets, which have been lifted by the threat of OMT, and the euro crisis is no longer viewed as much of a market risk. The second reason bonds have sold off has been the improvement in economic data since last summer â€“ especially relative to other major economies. Perhaps the best illustration of this is perhaps a simple chart showing the growth gap that has emerged between the United States (the world's largest economy) and the eurozone (the world's second-largest economy). Business Insider/Matthew Boesler, data from Bloomberg The truth about the economic data and its effect on Treasuries is a little more nuanced than that, though. In December, the Federal Reserve announced a significant policy change that has increased the sensitivity of Treasuries to U.S. economic data releases. Goldman Sachs The Fed said it would keep interest rates low in the U.S. economy at least until the unemployment rate fell to 6.5% and inflation reached 2.5%. That has caused the bond market to pay much closer attention to economic data releases, which have mostly been surprising to the upside of consensus forecasts over the past year or so. And because the Fed has been buying up so many Treasury bonds since the financial crisis under its quantitative easing program â€“ and now holds a significant portion of the entire market in its portfolio â€“ perceptions about how long the Fed will continue buying are the biggest factor weighing on the market right now. Investors rushed into bonds once again in March as the Cypriot financial crisis brought fears of a eurozone shockwave back to the fore, and concerns over a global slowdown began to resurface. That rally lasted through early May, pushing Treasury yields down once again. However, fears that the Fed will begin to taper its bond purchases soon have risen in a big way this month, capped by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's failure last week to rebuff a suggestion during a testimony before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress that the central bank could begin reducing the pace of its bond purchases as soon as Labor Day if the data warranted such action. Given the optimism reflected in Wall Street forecasts for the U.S. economy, strategists are beginning to espouse the view that such tapering could come sooner than previously expected. Goldman Sachs, for example, says the sell-off in the Treasury market is "for real" this time. If the U.S. economic data continue to improve and cause investors to push further and further into risky investments â€“ and the Fed actually does begin to tighten monetary policy stimulus â€“ the "safe haven" appeal appeal of the U.S. Treasury market could continue to dissipate.
Don't Panic About Rising Yields Just Yet (The Big Picture) Treasury yields have been rising recently but Barry Ritholtz says there's no reason to be alarmed about this. "Yields have moved up from the absurdly low level of 1.5% to 2% after a 30 year move down from 17%. Some people will scream that “yields have skyrocketed 25%” (but these are the same folks who have been yelling POMO! POMO! POMO! for 146%). It's just as silly to claim that yields have retraced only 50 bips of the 1400 basis point move. A better context is to note that yields have backed up 1/2 percent from the lows, and that will affect economic activity, earnings, and psychology in ways we may not fully recognize yet." He also writes that Fed tightening, inflation, and increased demand for capital cause yields to go up. In this case we don't know which it is and if it is demand for capital then that is a positive for the economy and stocks, not negative.  Death Of Managing Partner Raises Concerns For Investors That Lent Him Millions (The Wall Street Journal) In April, Invesco announced that it was selling Atlantic Trust Private Wealth Management to Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC). About a month later S. Mark Powell, head of Atlantic Trust's Texas office was found dead. The cause of death was undetermined. Now, the Wall Street Journal reports that some investors have said some of the money lent to Powell has gone missing. Invesco however said they didn't believe client accounts had been accessed.  From the WSJ: "Since Mr. Powell's body was found nearly two weeks ago, investors have come forward to say they lent him in total millions of dollars, according to people familiar with the matter. At least some of that money appears to have gone missing, the people said. An Invesco spokesman said in a statement that following Mr. Powell's death, the fund-management company has become "aware of unusual transactions Mr. Powell seems to have conducted personally outside of his work for Atlantic Trust." What The Bond Market Sell-Off Looks Like On A 222-Year Chart (Global Financial Data) The recent sell-off in the Treasury bond market has been one of the biggest market stories. Bond yields have reached their highest levels in over a year. Global Financial Data's chart shows 10-year Treasury yields going back to 1791. Global Financial Data Vanguard Lowers Cost Of Dividend Themed ETF (Barron's) Vanguard has lowered the cost of the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG) to 0.10% annually, from 0.13%. "When fund expenses get this low, they more or less approach zero. It’s a good reminder that you can cut out a lot of middlemen if you’re willing (and able) to manage your own money, and use an ETF instead of paying a pricey fund manager," writes Brendan Conway at Barron's. VIG is the 56th of Vanguard's 65 ETFs to cut its expense ratio compared to last year. 7 Psychology Concepts That You'll Find On Wall Street's Hardest Exam (Business Insider) There are seven common behavioral biases that drive investor decisions. 1. Overconfidence - These investors are often underdiversified and more vulnerable to market volatility. 2. Anchoring - Tied to overconfidence, this is when investors "revise" their analysis after finding information that significantly changes their initial assumptions. 3. Representativeness - "you incorrectly think one thing means something else." 4. Loss aversion. 5. Regret minimization - "when you avoid investing altogether or invest conservatively because you don't want to feel that regret." 6. Frame dependence - "The tendency to change risk tolerance based on the direction of the market." 7. Defense mechanisms - investors are great at making excuses for why they lost money.

Dave Stokes via www.flickr.com creative commonsWillingness to admit that you have been wrong is undoubtedly an admirable quality. Morgan Stanley's Head of U.S. Interest Rate Strategy, Matthew Hornbach, did just that in a recent note to clients after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke surprised markets and sparked a sell-off in Treasury bonds last week in his testimony before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress (emphasis added): Time to Change Our Core View on the Yield Curve?  Investors who have followed our research will have recognized our propensity to increase conviction in a view at precisely the wrong time. We tend to increase our conviction as the markets move in the direction of our view very much the same way that investors are supposed to add to winners (and cut losers short).  Last week, we advised investors to add to their 7s/30s and 10s/30s yield curve steepening positions with the view that Chairman Bernanke would calm expectations for tapering by September this year â€“ helping keep rates and volatility low. These curves have since flattened back to the levels at which we suggested investors enter steepeners. Given the uncertainty Bernanke injected into the market, we suggest investors pare down positions to more sustainable levels. At the same time, we keep to our core steepening view. We have held a core curve steepening view primarily between the high carry and expected rolldown sectors of the yield curve (5~10-year maturities) and the long end of the yield curve. We have held this steepening bias to varying degrees every week since June 29, 2012. The two exceptions occurred when we turned neutral on the curve on April 19, 2013 and remained neutral until April 26, 2013. Of course, Hornbach is far from the only one to have been caught off guard by Bernanke last week â€“ but he confronts it in a remarkably candid fashion and adjusts his view accordingly.
REUTERSThree separate bills to ban fracking in California have been introduced in Sacramento, as the state reckons with sitting on top of enormous shale energy deposits. Huffington Post's Aaron Sankin reports the bills call for separate conditional moratoriums on the practice, which involves shooting huge volumes of water down into rock formations to free up oil and gas: Assemblyman Richard Bloom's (D-Santa Monica) bill would put a moratorium on fracking and require legislative action to lift it, while Assemblywoman Holly Mitchell's (D-Los Angeles) bill would only lift the moratorium after an independent commission studies the practice's environmental effects. Assemblyman Adrin Nazarian's (D-Van Nuys) bill only applies to the area surrounding sources of groundwater that could theoretically be contaminated by the release of fracking wastewater.Â  The trio of bills cleared Sacramento's appropriations committee last week, Sankin says. We've discussed how fracking has gotten way out ahead of available science on the practice's health and environmental effects. While there are known cases of water being impacted by fracking, most drilling occurs without incident.Â  Meanwhile, new studies show California's Monterey shale â€” which basically stretches from L.A. to the Bay Area â€” could hold more than 15 billion barrels of oil. By one count developing the play could yield 3 million jobs. That's putting pressure on Gov. Jerry Brown to pull the trigger to help his state, which despite a projected surplus still shows scars from the downturn. Some of the most powerful environmental groups are based in California. But so are some of the country's largest oil companies. It's gonna get bloody.

At 44 years old, Nicole Jackson says she has bigger concerns than the six-figure student loan debt that has shadowed her for the last 20 years. Jackson, a Miami, Fla.-based family law attorney, gave up on ever paying off her $186,000 federal student loan balance years ago. At $1,600 per month, her monthly loan payments eclipsed her $1,200/month mortgage and she and her husband are raising three teenage daughters.  "The way I see it, I'm already screwed," Jackson told us. "I'd rather make sure my kids are OK. Unless I start making significantly more money [my situation] is not gonna change." With the nation struggling under a $1 trillion student debt crisis, stories like Jackson's are nothing uncommon. For the first time ever, the national student loan default rate exceeds the credit card delinquency rate, and so long as student loans remain one of the few types of debt that can't be discharged in bankruptcy, chances are the situation won't improve any time soon.  At the beginning of her story, Jackson, a native New Yorker, was one of the lucky ones. Her father, a doctor, paid for a year of her undergraduate studies, leaving her free to dodge student loans for a while. And with a well-paying job at a Manhattan law firm, she had more than enough funds to finance the rest of her undergraduate studies.  But when Jackson decided to pursue her dream of becoming an attorney at the University of Miami, it became impossible to avoid taking on debt. "My intention was to go back to work after my first year of law school," she said. "[But] I did so poorly that I didn't think I could [keep a job at the same time]. So that’s when I started borrowing money." It was a costly decision. Jackson took out about $26,000 in federal loans for each year of law school and then another $20,000 in private loans to keep afloat while she studied for the bar exam. She graduated in 1994 with more than $100,000 of debt. Within three years, she had one daughter, a surprise set of twins, and was earning less than $50,000 per year. "It’s always been a struggle," she said. "I worked for the state of Florida most of my [career] and the most I was making was $50,000/year. With three kids, it wasn’t enough money." So she, like many other borrowers, bought as much time as she could, starting by consolidating her federal student loans. Since she worked for the state, she was able to defer payments and declare financial hardship as well –– whatever it took to keep from defaulting.   "[My debt] is not going anywhere because I do not make enough money, not because I have just ignored it," she said.    Her private loans took top priority. The payments were only $130/month, but since private lenders don't offer the same deferment options as federal, it was either pay or roll out the welcome mat for debt collectors. Meanwhile, her federal loans ballooned. With an 8% interest rate, they appreciated even after she consolidated, growing from a principal balance of about $80,000 in 1994 to $186,000 today. Other than her home and a car payment, it's the only debt she carries to this day.  Eventually, her debt drove her back to New York, where she moved her family and took a lucrative job at a Manhattan law firm. She was finally able to start making federal loan payments, but the move took a toll on her family life. "I was making six figures, working 13/14 hour days, and my kids were sad because I wasn’t around," she said. "I wanted the money but I didn't want my kids to be miserable. They were babies."  After two years, they packed up and headed back to Miami, where Jackson continued plugging away on whatever legal cases came her way. Exhausted with state work, she started her own firm in 2008 with the hope that she'd earn more and could finally begin chipping away at her loans.  Last year, she was able to enroll in an income-based repayment plan for her federal loan, a perk that private lenders don't offer. Her monthly payments were reduced to $74, though the prospect of paying $74/month on a $186,000 debt hasn't exactly made the burden seem any lighter.  For now, she has her eyes on her future –– namely, her daughters' futures. Her eldest will be in college in 2015, and Jackson devoted her savings to establish a prepaid college savings plan for all three of her kids.  "I’ve stressed to my daughter the importance of not borrowing any money. If she doesn't get a scholarship or there’s money that needs to be found somewhere, I’ll borrow it myself and I'll deal with it before I let her," she said. "I don't want my kids going into life with this over their heads."
Citi's Tobias Levkovich is increasingly worried that investors are getting a bit too excited about buying. Among other things, he notes that correlations between stocks are breaking down.  In other words, stocks are increasingly trading independent of each other. From his recent note to clients: Intriguingly, intra-stock correlation of the top 50 market cap stocks in the S&amp;P 500 has fallen back towards the 20% area (see Figure 3) indicating far less concern around macro issues and thereby greater willingness for fund managers to focus mainly on micro developments or specific stock ideas; something they rather enjoy doing. But, it suggests that macro risks are not being considered enough and thus a poor number on Chinese PMI, for instance, can generate volatile trading patterns as seen with the Nikkei (and its global reverberations) this past week. Typically, correlations rise and fall with market-wide volatility.  Levkovich seems to be arguing that low correlations are reflective of complacency. Citi Research Macro surprises are captured in Citi's Economic Surprise Index (CESI), which has not been bullish. From Levkovich: Some investors have suggested that Citi’s Economic Surprise Index is more positive on the macro front, but the major economies’ version of the index (see Figure 4), which has the greatest correlation (albeit coincident rather than causal) with the S&amp;P 500, has stabilized for now rather than necessarily signaling a new uptrend.  Citi Research "Thus, we suspect investors are looking for excuses to increase their equity positions as rising benchmarks are causing enormous performance anxiety," said Levkovich of underperforming fund managers.
Peter MacDiarmid/Getty ImagesThere was an audible cringe on Wall Street when Goldman Sachs Elevator (@gselevator, GSE) started Tweeting. It may have even been louder than the laughter. The humorous Twitter account launched back in 2011 â€” it claimed to be a collection of comments heard in the halls (elevators) of Goldman Sachs from NYC to Hong Kong. Obviously people were skeptical. Who in the cult of Goldman would betray their own? Who would Tweet things that seemed to be a caricature of what people think bankers are â€” selfish, entitled, racist, sexist, classist (add any ist here). In a word: douche bags. Here's a sample:  This one goes out to the skeptics, and we await their commentary. The banker behind GSE agreed to talk to Business Insider because he's joining Gentology, an eCommerce site just for men where celebrities like the NBA's Paul Pierce and rappers 3 Six Mafia hand pick their favorite products, from apparel to gadgets, to sell on the site. They're called Celebrity Curators, and obviously, GSE's celebrity lives in the same space as Gentology â€” online. "I do have this intellectual curiosity with respect to the overall Twitter dynamic," said GSE. "...I am curious to see how many people I can get to do something (starting with something as simple as clicking on a link)... In December, again just for the hell of it, I released a link to my ideal Christmas wish list (A $6k backgammon set, $18k shotgun, etc)....Fast forward to this Storefront concept.." It's a fast forward indeed. The proceeds from all of these sales, it should be noted, will be donated to charity. Naturally, from GSE, you can expect high-end products with sarcastic twist. That is, after all, what his Twitter feed is about â€” airing the shocking, macho, three quarter truths that come from the mouths of Wall Streeters. "It's fairly easy to remain anonymous I would say," GSE said. "I just don't tell anyone about it. I mix and match stories. I extend the lag on something I overhear directly between when I hear it and when I tweet it. Even to this day, some tweets will be a derivative of something I might have heard (or said, sadly) 8-10-12 years ago, that had been previously unremembered. There is also a core group of trusted confidants who feed me ideas, whereby I know who they are but they don't know me. Without stating the obvious at this point, it quite clearly goes beyond elevators and Goldman Sachs. It's the absurd, douchey, insightful, funny, and offensive things that bankers say anywhere (elevators, hotel lobbies, airport lounges, bars, etc).... So the amount of possible material is limitless." And there are no limits to what GSE will write, for the most part (he does worry about offending, say, Sallie Krawcheck or Kate Upton). The only person who knows who he is, aside from 2 or 3 close friends, is GSE's literary agent. Yes, there's a book coming, but don't expect it to be anything like Greg Smith's 'Why I Left Goldman Sachs' tell-all (GSE says Smith was a "nobody"). Expect a ridiculous, raucous collection of vignettes about banking culture where the names and situations have been changed to protect the identity of others as much as GSE's. "Things have definitely changed," GSE reflected. "In the mid 2000s, when shuffled the hedge fund sales team in Asia, the first thing the outgoing salesperson gave the new guy was the telephone number to his drug dealer. That's 100% true. It's not quite like that anymore, but part of that is a function of Asia growing up alot since the Asian Crisis of the late 90s. And today in New York, it's hyper sensitive. I saw a new kid get berated recently for innocently calling someone a 'monkey' on the trading floor because it was deemed potentially racist." London, he says, is worse...Asia? Forget about it. Still, bankers generally don't mean everything they say, GSE pointed out. "They do talk tougher than they are. But that's part of the culture in terms of one-upsmanship, or who has the bigger balls so to speak. It starts as analysts... who can cheat on the homework during training, who can skip a day and get someone else to sign in for them, and then who can 'work hard, play hard' the hardest. Many of those cliches are pathetically true. And you just have to go to a bar where a group of analysts are hanging out to see it." That kind of culture is hard to change. Competition is inherent in finance. If you change things in the U.S., Europe might get an edge. Tone things down in Europe, and the cowboys in Asia will ride away with your payday. "...it takes a certain kind of person to want to work in banking... and I don't mean that as a compliment. Generally, it's just someone who did well in school, is perhaps unsure of what they want to do, or don't have the balls to go out with an idea and take a risk." Goldman's response to his feed, he says, has been pitch perfect. They ignore it. And why wouldn't they: who's to say Goldman Sachs Elevator is real anyway?
AP, Verge Images, Photoshop by Jay YarowApple has made a number of small missteps over the past few years that, combined with some adverse market trends and the death of Steve Jobs, have led to Apple's stock getting clobbered. We've described many of these factors in detail: None of these by itself was a big issue. But, together, they added up to a stock that got ahead of itself in 2012 on the strength of a few of quarters of spectacular iPhone profitability, followed by a severe margin compression that caused the stock to get cut in half. But in addition to all of these small issues, there is also evidence to suggest that something big has gone wrong at Apple over the past year. And that something, we would guess, is likely problems with the launch of a major new product category--namely, Apple's television set. In his last few public presentations, Apple CEO Tim Cook has been on the defensive about one main issue, which is Apple's lack of new product launches this year. And these questions are understandable. As the chart below shows, Apple is in the midst of an unprecedented drought in terms of new product launches. Business Insider As BI's Jay Yarow observed earlier this year, by the time Apple's developer conference, WWDC, rolls around in a couple of weeks, Apple will have gone a staggering 230 days between new product announcements. That's more than twice as long as any new product gap in recent history. And it's 3-4 times as long as Apple's normal new-product gap over this period. Given Apple's extraordinary skill at developing, manufacturing, and launching new products, we highly doubt that this drought was planned. Rather, we suspect that Apple had planned to launch a major new product late last year or early this year, one that would have carried the company through this drought. And based on all the reports about an Apple television that hit the market early last year--most of which predicted that Apple would launch its TV in the 2012 holiday season (or at least announce it and then start selling it early in 2013)--we'd bet that that major new product was intended to be Apple's TV. Alas, for unknown reasons--perhaps having to do with the TV industry's refusal to meet Apple's distribution demands--the predictions for the arrival of the TV have now been rolled forward a year, to late 2013 or early 2014. Given Apple's secrecy, we may never know for sure why the company has effectively gone at least nine months without launching a significant new product. But looking at the chart above, it seems likely that a product that was expected to launch earlier this year took longer than expected to become a reality. Disclosure: I own Apple stock.
Flickr/Elvert Barnes(Reuters) - Service Corp International agreed to buy Stewart Enterprises Inc. for $1.13 billion, merging the two largest U.S. funeral home operators as the industry gears up to offer more services to aging baby boomers. Large-scale consolidation in the highly fragmented funeral business has long been on the cards, with the industry looking to sell more pre-planned funeral contracts to the 76 million baby boomers in the United States. Service Corp, which failed in a bid to take over Stewart in 2008, said on Wednesday the combined company would have a backlog of future revenue exceeding $9 billion from pre-planned bookings. The group would own 1,653 funeral homes and 515 cemeteries in 48 states, eight Canadian provinces and in Puerto Rico, and have proforma revenue of nearly $3 billion. Shares of Service Corp, which had revenue of $2.4 billion in 2012, rose as much as 11 percent, suggesting investors were happy with the deal, which was priced at 24.5 times Stewart's forward earnings. The number of funeral homes and crematories owned by both the companies would be about 20 percent or less of the total in the United States, said Barbara Kemmis, Executive Director of Cremation Association of North America. "I see this as evidence that there is room in this industry for economies of scale and consolidation," she said. Just under 25 percent of the U.S. population was over the age of 55 in 2011, up from 20.4 percent in 2000, according to the Census Bureau. PREMIUM OF 36 PERCENT The deal is valued at about $1.13 billion based on shares outstanding as of February 28, according to Thomson Reuters data. Including debt, the transaction is valued at $1.4 billion. Stewart rejected an unsolicited $1 billion takeover offer from Service Corp in 2008. Excluding one-time costs, the deal is expected to immediately add to normalized earnings per share, Service Corp said. Houston-based Service Corp will buy all of Stewart's outstanding Class A and Class B common stock at $13.25 per share, a premium of 36 percent to Tuesday's close. Service Corp said it expected to generate about $60 million in annual cost savings, and anticipated the synergies to be fully realized over a 24-month period from the closing of the deal, expected late this year or early in 2014. The acquirer said it intended to maintain an infrastructure presence in Stewart's New Orleans base. Stewart Chairman Frank Stewart, whose grandfather founded the company in 1910, has agreed to vote his 30 percent stake in the company in favor of the takeover. Service Corp said it had a financing commitment from JPMorgan Chase Bank and that together with cash on hand this would be sufficient to complete the acquisition. J.P. Morgan and Shearman &amp; Sterling LLP were financial and legal advisers respectively to the company. Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co advised Stewart's board, while Jones Walker LLP served as legal adviser. Latham &amp; Watkins LLP served as legal adviser to chairman Stewart. Service Corp shares were up 7.5 percent at $18.94 on the New York Stock Exchange at midday, while Stewart's stock was up 33.7 percent at $13.03 on the Nasdaq.

China's Sky 32 is one of the most elite casino lounges on the planet. Perched on the 32nd floor of theÂ Galaxy Macau casino and resort, the VIP mecca has gorgeous views, diamond chandeliers, and six opulent rooms where high rollers must commit to betting at least 10 million yuan â€” that's $1.6 million â€” per visit, according to Bloomberg. The Macau casino finally openedÂ in 2011 after nine years in development ,with the hope that its luxurious amenities, 600 gaming tables, and 250 suites would attract China's wealthiest patrons. And despite worries that there would be a government crackdown on Macau gambling, Bloomberg reports the luxury VIP betting business has fared well. In fact, the Galaxy Macau Casino raked in $38 billion in revenue last year, more than six times that of the Las Vegas Strip. The Galaxy Macau is a mega-casino resort in the Cotai strip that cost nearly US$2 billion to build. REUTERS/Bobby Yip In March of 2013 alone, it raked in $3.9 billion, according to Bloomberg. REUTERS/Bobby Yip Its VIP lounge is on the 32nd floor. This is the elaborate lobby that greets Macau's high rollers. Wikimedia Commons Everything about Sky 32 is opulent, even the areas where guests aren't betting. Take for instance this bar and restaurant. Wikimedia Commons To play in this VIP setting, patrons need to be willing to bet a minimum of $1.6 million per visit. Wikimedia Commons There are six rooms that span the floor, including this intimate gambling area. Wikimedia Commons And don't forget to enjoy the view â€” both inside and out. Wikimedia Commons
ShutterstockSleepaway camp is a great summer activity, if you can afford it.Â  Groups like YMCA and Girl Scouts offer inexpensive camping options.

Many are located in the mountains of the northeast, and cost more than $1,000 every week.Â To put it in perspective: The cost of these camps is equivalent to a semester at a state college.

flickr: hans thijsIn May of 1913, Russian composer Igor Stravinsky premiered his ballet, 'The Rite of Spring' in Paris' ThÃ©Ã¢tre des Champs-Ã‰lysÃ©es and people totally flipped out. Witnesses say that attendees started throwing things, fist fighting, and at least one person was challenged to a duel. From the BBC: Lydia Sokolova, one of the dancers on the stage that night, said the audience came prepared. "They had got themselves all ready. They didn't even let the music be played for the overture. As soon as it was known that the conductor was there, the uproar began," she said in an interview recorded in 1965. If you're not a classical music buff, consider this something to put in your cocktail conversation arsenal. The Rite of Spring wasn't just a ballet, it was a massive challenge to music as it was. At the turn of the century, the debate in music obviously wasn't about rock vs. hip hop, it was a lot headier than that. The 1800s was dominated by Romanticsm, flowing melodies and grandiose symphonic compositions full of nationalistic sentiment and emotion. Philosophers believed that music was the highest form of art because it took no shape, and when you heard it, you just felt without any connection to an object. Wikimedia CommonsThe New York Times after the Rite of SpringStravinsky basically told all of that to shove it. He wanted the music to be an object. To forget the melody and create something with sound. That's why, if you've ever heard the Rite, it sounds jagged and edgy. To Stravinsky, when you performed the ballet, you were also creating a thing, not just a feeling. At that time, ballet was an art form the Russians had come to dominate. Stravinksy and choreographer Vaslav Nijinsky's complicated that form as well. 'The Rite' had no plot in the traditional sense, but was just a series of dances, and instead of making dancers perfect and graceful, their movements were wild and violent. In short: Stravinsky's Rite of Spring isn't about some gentle baby birds being born in their nests. Its the violent emergence of life against the odds of nature. To an audience steeped in the beauty of Romanticism this was either daring and refreshing, or a show of Russian "primitivism" in the most pejorative sense. That's why everyone went completely wild. Imagine that happening at the ballet now. To see why this ballet isn't like The Nutcracker, check out the video below: 
YouTube/Margin CallIt's been a crazy few weeks in the Treasury bond market. After a big rally that began in mid-March, amid the outbreak of the Cypriot financial crisis and fears over a slowdown in global growth, Treasuries have given up all of their gains, and bond yields are now rising to the highest levels in over a year. This morning, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury hit a high of 2.23%. Naturally, there is a lot of debate over where yields go next. Goldman Sachs, one of the prominent shops calling for higher yields, has published a call saying the sell-off in Treasuries is "for real" this time. Despite hitting a high of 2.23% earlier, yields have since backed down to 2.15%, and bonds are now positive on the day. And amid the wild price action, we're seeing a massive amount of trading in the market. Yesterday, trading volumes in the Treasury futures market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange rose to an all-time high. "CME Group's Treasury complex also experienced record volumes yesterday in the 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note futures (4,216,687), the 5-year U.S. Treasury Note futures and options (2,994,162), and the 2-Year U.S. Treasury Note futures and options (1,929,500)," said the CME in a release. Today, with bonds slightly in the green, it looks like the market is on pace to break the record yet again. Brean Capital Head of Rates Russ Certo passes along some trading volume information in the cash market as of 1:30 PM – $32 billion have traded in 2-year Treasuries, $80 billion in 5-years, $29 billion in 7-years, and $72 billion in 10-years.

The big story in markets over the past few weeks has been the sell-off in the Treasury bond market and the accompanying rise in bond yields to their highest levels in over a year. Goldman strategists are out with a call declaring the sell-off "for real" this time after a number of false starts. The chart below, via Global Financial Data, shows the 10-year Treasury yields going back to 1791, as well as concurrent activity in the stock market. The chart isn't granular enough to see the move over the past few weeks, but it does show the rise in interest rates since bottoming out about a year ago. Just a blip, for now.

">Robert Thomson via FlickrThere's an interesting argument to be made about why a slow-growth recovery can actually be beneficial, despite the fact that we can't seem to get above stall speed and out of the rut. The great thing about this sluggishness return to normal, according to David Trainer of New Constructs, is that the reallocation of capital is much smarter and more deliberate this time around. By forcing business owners and investors to be more disciplined in their decision-making processes, less bad ideas or expensive deals get funded, foolish projects aren't pursued and mistakes from the last cycle are not repeated. Here's Trainer's explanation, via WealthManagement.com: Slow rebound in GDP means businesses are allocating capital more efficiently.Â  It also means capital is not being redeployed into the same businesses from which it was most recently taken. Usually, the first businesses to die in tough times are the worst, ie lowest ROIC. Too often after recent recessions, capital is redeployed into the businesses from which it was most recently taken and GDP is able to bounce back quickly. I do not think that is happening this time. Slow growth and slower rates of corporate investment (corporate cash balances are near all times highs) suggest businesses are being more deliberate and careful about how they spend money. Being slow and careful to spend is smart capital allocation, which lays the groundwork for higher ROICs and productivity gains in the future. Oracle Corporation (ORCL) is a great example of a company that has grown more deliberate and more efficient with its use of capital in recent years. From 2004 to 2008, Oracle significantly increased its capital stock, increasingÂ invested capitalÂ from $530 million to $28.4 billion. In return for that massive capital increase, ORCL barely even doubled its net operating profit afterÂ taxÂ (NOPAT) over that same time frame, driving downÂ ROICÂ from almost 400% to 23.5%. Now, that 400% ROIC was obviously unsustainable, and decreasing returns were always going to accompany the new investment required for Oracle to grow. However, the rapid rate of growth in investment and decline in returns suggests that Oracle, spurred on by the free-spending corporate culture of the mid-2000â€™s, was neither careful nor efficient with its capital during this time period. Since 2008, the metrics on Oracle tell a very different story. With just 30% growth inÂ invested capitalÂ over the past four years, Oracle has nearly doubled itsÂ NOPAT. Oracleâ€™sROICÂ is up to 32% and has risen every year since 2008. Accumulated asset write-downs totaling barely 1% of net assets attests to the minimal amount of capital Oracle wastes. If one looks only at profits, the past four years look very similar to the preceding four. However, a closer look reveals that the growth of 2004-2008 was driven by a massive capital spending, while the growth from 2008-2012 has been driven by increasing efficiency. Good food for thought - although most of us would probably prefer the more reckless old school 5% growth rate by now  Source: Why I'm Bullish and We Are Not in a Bubble (WealthManagement)
Apple shook the financial markets when it announced it would tap the bond markets to finance a $50 billion expansion to its share buyback plan. Recently, interest rates have been increasing notably, which means corporate borrowing costs are on the rise. Chris Kimble of Kimble Charting Solutions posted this chart on Advisor Perspectives of the 10-year yield marking Apple's bond sale. "Was the timing almost perfect by Apple, coming to the market 30 days ago, right before the 10-year yield rallies 30%?" asks Kimble.Â  "So far it looks like Apple had great timing in selling these bonds."

statigr.am/rosie_hartHow much weight does an Ivy League degree hold? Tom Friedman argued in a New York Times column that in this economy, it doesn't matter whether you went to Yale or not. Employers don't care what you know unless you can help solve problems. He says "there's been an important shift in the education-to-work model in America," and it's a game-changer:Â  "Since jobs are evolving so quickly, with so many new tools, a bachelorâ€™s degree is no longer considered an adequate proxy by employers for your ability to do a particular job â€” and, therefore, be hired. So, more employers are designing their own tests to measure applicantsâ€™ skills. And they increasingly donâ€™t care how those skills were acquired: home schooling, an online university, a massive open online course, or Yale. They just want to know one thing: Can you add value?" While college degree holders still earn an undisputed wage premium overall, colleges have still failed their students by not giving them enough tools to enter the real world. And while that wage premium exists today, people like Peter Thiel â€” who pays innovative students to drop out of college and launch their own startup â€”may push this premium down. Harvard Professor and "father of disruption" Clay Christensen is outspoken about how higher education is the next industry to be disrupted. If that's the case, then the job market will only get more competitive, and grads will have to prove themselves much beyond their pedigree. In his column, Friedman wrote about a recruiting startup, hireart.com, that defines what the future of the labor market could look like: "[Hireart co-founder Eleonora] Sharef pointed to one applicant, a Detroit woman who had worked as a cashier at Borders. She realized that that had no future, so she taught herself Excel. 'We gave her a very rigorous test, and she outscored people who had gone to Stanford and Harvard. She ended up as a top applicant for a job that, on paper, she was completely unqualified for.'" Stories like that aren't the rule yet â€” connections and other advantages are still important, and always will be â€” but we're moving more in that direction, especially as technology is making learning and acquiring new skills easier than ever. Business Insider's Henry Blodget, who went to Yale, recently gave similar advice as Friedman to graduates: "The real world doesn't care where you went to school or what you did when you were there. Your diploma might help you get a job, but the moment you start working, the only thing that will matter is how much you help your bosses, colleagues, employers, clients, and/or customers. So, congratulations on your success â€” you deserve it. But if you want to do well in life, forget about all of that and start helping."
ZURICH (Reuters) - The Swiss government agreed on Wednesday to create a legal basis that will allow its banks to settle investigations by U.S. authorities into their role in helping wealthy Americans evade billions of dollars in tax. The agreement would give dozens of banks permission to reach settlements, expected to require them to pay fines totaling billions of dollars to the U.S. authorities. Special permission will be granted to allow banks to turn over new information about the behavior of their staff and clients, although the government said no changes would be made to rules protecting clients' identities. After a regular cabinet meeting, the finance department said the government was proposing legislation to be rushed through parliament in the summer session in June. "If banks were not authorized to cooperate with the U.S. authorities, the initiation of further criminal investigations or charges concerning banking institutions could not be ruled out," the department said in a statement. The country's biggest bank UBS was forced in 2009 to pay a fine of $780 million and hand over the names of more than 4,000 clients, delivering the U.S. authorities information that allowed them to then pursue other Swiss banks. Switzerland's long tradition of bank secrecy, which protects the identity of its clients, has seen the country become a haven for untaxed funds and the world's biggest offshore center, with $2 trillion in assets. But that tradition has come under heavy fire since the financial crisis as cash-strapped governments around the world have clamped down on tax evasion, with authorities probing Swiss banks in Germany and France as well as the United States. The banks under formal U.S. investigation include Credit Suisse, Julius Baer, British bank HSBC's Swiss arm, privately-held Pictet in Geneva, and smaller players such as LLB's Swiss arm and local government-backed Zuercher Kantonalbank and Basler Kantonalbank. The Swiss government has been negotiating with U.S. authorities for two years to try to resolve the tax dispute, but has been hamstrung by secrecy laws as well as squabbling among the country's banks as to who should pay what. The Swiss announcement on Wednesday did not include any details of how much banks might have to pay in fines, although sources have said the total for the financial industry might amount to $10 billion. Finance Minister Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf said the government had not discussed a total sum for fines and would not offer financial assistance for banks as they seek individual settlements. The finance department said the bill the cabinet adopted on Wednesday would allow banks to hand over information about their employees involved in the U.S. business and patterns of client behavior, but not identities of clients except under conditions already authorized by bilateral agreements. Switzerland's oldest private bank, Wegelin &amp; Co, said in January it was closing down after pleading guilty to helping Americans evade taxes, paying a fine of nearly $58 million.

The New York Observer has a new column called 'Isn't That Rich?' chronicling the social lives of the Upper East Side of Manhattan's uber wealthy â€” this may sound familiar.  In the latest installment, one dad, Richard Kirshenbaum, laments how increasingly, wealthy parents are using their drivers to fill the role that too-busy-dads have left empty. Chauffeurs are meteing out punishments, confiscating phones, and hauling too drunk 16 year-olds out of clubs. The parents, Kirshenbaum says, find that doing this kind of parenting can force them to miss spin class, come home from St. Barth's early, and/or engage in other undesirable, socially disturbing activity. Better to let precocious Upper East Side kids drink early (age 15 or so) in front of their parents, and let the staff (ideally retired cops as they make the best drivers) deal with the consequences. Now, there are three types of fathers that relegate their responsibilities to drivers, according the Observer â€” the "me time" dads, the divorced and then the worst kind... From the NYO: The last subsetâ€”perhaps the chief offendersâ€”is a group whose own deficiencies as teenagers fuel their kidsâ€™ social lives. Theyâ€™re the formerly uncool high school students who want desperately to live vicariously through their children. The men tend to be Napoleonic and, having conquered the world of finance, they often have unlimited cash and credit to dispense to their progeny. They populate New York campuses with incredibly indulged and well-dressed children and believe that money and power are the keys to popularity. For them, drivers are less chaperon es than enablers: helping kids gain club access, bottle service, fake IDs and, yes, romantic partners. Â So the point is people â€” sometimes TV is real.
Solar and wind power aren't yet reliable enough to be the electricity industry's preferred green power source, according to infrastructure consultancy Black and Veatch's annual industry survey. Black and Veatch interviewed 607 industry folks from 367 different firms and asked them which environmentally friendly electricity source they favored. For at least the fifth year in a row, nuclear came out on top, with natural gas now just behind it. Here's the chart: Black and Veatch Here's B&amp;V's Ryan Pletka on why the most environmentally friendly technologies aren't so hot with industry folks: Consistent with their mandate, Electric Utility Report survey respondents emphasized technologies that ensure the highest levels of reliability, while recognizing growing concern over environmental impacts. The rankings support these dual concerns as nuclear generation and natural gas have reduced emission profiles versus other fossil fuel-based technologies. However, due to the intermittent nature of wind/solar with present technology, they are not viewed as within the industry as preferred baseload generation sources." Nuclear's emissions are negligible, while the EPA recently cut estimates of how much natural gas emits, though the latter point remains somewhat disputed.

Stifel Nicolaus' Dave Lutz points us to reports that Senator Bob Corker will push to wind down Fannie and Freddie as part of housing finance reform. Fannie and Freddie are government sponsored enterprises (GSE) that were created to boost liquidity in the mortgage markets buy packaging mortgages and selling them off to investors as bonds (or mortgage-back securities). These MBS also came with implicit guarantees, which got the them into trouble when the housing bubble burst. It's worth noting that Fannie and Freddie are traded on the Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board.  Stocks trading on the OTCBB often experience more volatility than stocks traded on the Nasdaq or New York Stock Exchange.

William Thomas Cain/Getty ImagesThe Mortgage Bankers' Association latest data showed that mortgage applications fell 8.8%, falling for the third week in a row. There are also concerns that higher rates will hurt the housing comeback. These items, along with a broader sell-off in markets, seems to be driving down homebuilder stocks.
The U.S. housing market crash of 2007-2008 presented a big opportunity for those in the market to buy a home. Mortgage rates lurched lower, continuing their downward trajectory to historic lows reached in late 2012. And, of course, home prices came way down. Here are mortgage rates. Business Insider/Matthew Boesler, data from Bloomberg And here are home prices. Business Insider/Matthew Boesler, data from Bloomberg The combination has propelled the "Housing Affordability Index" published by the National Association of Realtors to all-time highs. Business Insider/Matthew Boesler, data from Bloomberg Note from NAR's website:Â To interpret the indices, a value of 100 means that a family with the median income has exactly enough income to qualify for a mortgage on a median-priced home. An index above 100 signifies that family earning the median income has more than enough income to qualify for a mortgage loan on a median-priced home, assuming a 20 percent down payment. Now, there is concern that these trends are starting to reverse. Increased talk of tapering of monetary stimulus by the Federal Reserve has provided the impetus for the rise in interest rates in recent weeks. There is rift of opinion over where interest rates go next, but some prominent voices in the market â€“ Goldman Sachs, for example â€“ say the sell-off in the bond market is "for real" this time, and rates will continue to rise from here. Meanwhile, house prices have been flying higher, and it looks like the market has carved out a bottom. "After making a peak to trough decline of 33.8% from April 2006 to March 2012, the Case-Shiller home price index (C-S) has since advanced +10.9%," wrote Deutsche Bank Chief U.S. Economist Joe LaVorgna in a note yesterday. "The fact that C-S gains have been so broad-based suggests to us that they should persist, because we have found that breadth is often a sign of durability." If both interest rates and house prices continue to rise, housing affordability will go down, and the historic opportunity will be over. However, the good news is that housing affordability shouldn't go down all that much, even if it comes off its peak levels, according to LaVorgna: The housing affordability index, which includes interest rates as well as income and prices in its calculation, remains just shy of its all-time record high. This was not the case in the last downturn, when affordability was very low, owing to a bubble-like rise in home prices that didÂ not jibe with the fundamentals. But what about interest ratesâ€”are they not artificially low and therefore the primary reason why affordability is so high? We think the short answer to this question is â€œNoâ€. While rates are being depressed by QE, home prices are still about 27% below their previous peak according to C-S. Over this same period, personal income is up sharply. In fact, if mortgage rates went up 100 basis points from their current level, all else being equal, affordability would still remain higher than it has been in every year prior to 2010. Secondly, all else is probably not equal because a 100 basis point rise in mortgage rates would likely be associated with a meaningful economic improvement, including a step-up in income growth (i.e., faster job gains). Therefore, the negative hit to housing affordability would be partly mitigated. Click here to read LaVorgna's full note &gt;

Here's the details of Total's scheme: The SEC alleges that Total made more than $150 million in profits through the bribery scheme.  Total attempted to cover up the true nature of the illegal payments by entering into sham consulting agreements with intermediaries of the Iranian official and mischaracterizing the bribes in its books and records as legitimate “business development expenses” related to the consulting agreements.  Total had inadequate systems to properly review the consulting agreements and lacked sufficient internal controls to comply with federal laws prohibiting bribery. Total is also being charged by the Justice Department in parallel criminal proceedings. The company has agreed to pay a $645 million fine to settle both claims. And here's the full release: The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged France-based oil and gas company Total S.A. with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by paying $60 million in bribes to intermediaries of an Iranian government official who then exercised his influence to help the company obtain valuable contracts to develop significant oil and gas fields in Iran.  The SEC alleges that Total made more than $150 million in profits through the bribery scheme.  Total attempted to cover up the true nature of the illegal payments by entering into sham consulting agreements with intermediaries of the Iranian official and mischaracterizing the bribes in its books and records as legitimate “business development expenses” related to the consulting agreements.  Total had inadequate systems to properly review the consulting agreements and lacked sufficient internal controls to comply with federal laws prohibiting bribery. Total, whose securities are publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange, agreed to pay more than $398 million to settle the SEC’s charges and a parallel criminal matter announced today by the U.S. Department of Justice. “Total used illicit payments to win business in Iran, and reaped substantial financial benefits as a result,” said Andrew M. Calamari, Director of the SEC’s New York Regional Office.  “Total must now pay back all of its profits from the company’s corrupt conduct and additionally pay criminal penalties on top of that.” According to the SEC’s order instituting settled administrative proceedings, Total negotiated a development contract in 1995 with the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) for the country’s Sirri A and E oil and gas fields.  Prior to executing the contract, Total held a meeting with the Iranian official and agreed to enter into a purported consulting agreement with an intermediary he designated.  They agreed that Total would make payments to the intermediary under the guise of a consulting agreement when the real purpose was to induce the Iranian official to use his influence to help obtain NIOC’s approval of the development agreement.  After the contract was executed, Total corruptly made the bribery payments that resulted in NIOC allowing Total to develop the Sirri A and E oil and gas fields and make more than $150 million in profits. The SEC’s order requires Total to pay disgorgement of $153 million in illicit profits and retain an independent compliance consultant to review and report on Total’s compliance with the FCPA.  Total also must cease and desist from committing or causing any violations of Section 30A, Section 13(b)(2)(A), and Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In the parallel criminal proceedings, Total agreed to pay a $245.2 million penalty as part of a deferred prosecution agreement.  Total also was charged today by the prosecutor of Paris (François Molins, Procureur de la République) of the Tribunal de Grande Instance de Paris for violations of French laws.  The SEC’s investigation was led by Sharon Binger, Alex Janghorbani, and Barry O’Connell of the New York Regional Office’s Enforcement Division with significant assistance from the SEC Enforcement Division’s FCPA Unit and the Department of Justice’s Criminal Division’s Fraud Section.  The SEC also appreciates the assistance of French regulatory authorities.

After six months on the market, Madonna has sold her 6,000-square-foot Central Park West pad to hedge fund manager Deepak Narula for well under the $19.995 million asking price, The Wall Street Journal reports. The apartment had initially been listed for $23.5 million, a figure that was lowered months later. The final sale price was not disclosed, but it was "considerably less" than it was listed for, according to the WSJ. The apartment, which Madonna had owned for years, has six bedrooms, eight bathrooms, and 110 feet of Central Park frontage. It was once featured in a spread in Architectural Digest and we can see why: The simple decor was done by her younger brother Christopher G. Ciccone. The apartment is in a co-op that was built in 1907, and has 10'3" foot ceilings, a library, and five wood-burning fireplaces.

Flickr via shankboneYou’ve seen them on the bus, in museums, and at movie theaters: senior discounts. As a reward for being old, senior citizens pay a quarter less for bus fare, a small fortune less for movie tickets, and receive discounts generally all over the place.  If you’re a twentysomething, or part of what some journalists have colorfully called “the screwed generation,” you may be wondering: why not me? The idea that seniors are a group in need of help and protection dates back to the thirties, when America’s senior citizens were disproportionately poor and affected by the Depression wiping out everyone's savings. In 1935, President Roosevelt passed the Social Security Act, which gave federal assistance to the elderly. This became the norm. Aid to seniors increased over time, in particular with the creation of Medicare in 1965 and the passage of an amendment indexing social security to cost of living increases and creating an additional Supplemental Security Income for seniors in 1972.  As two poverty economists note, “One of the most striking trends in elderly well-being in the twentieth century was the dramatic decline in income poverty among the elderly.” This can be seen in the graph below.  The United States only began measuring poverty in the 1960s, so we lack standard figures dating farther back than that. But it’s recognized that the trend of decreasing poverty among seniors dates back to the thirties and forties. 2011 Census figures place poverty among Americans aged 65 and older at 8.7%, well below the national average of 15%.  Today it is the Millennials, the youngest generation, that finds itself poor, vulnerable, and screwed by financial storms caused by another generation. Unemployment among 18-29 year olds is 11.1% and has been over 10% for 53 months. The rate for people age 16-24 is16.1%. Poverty is highest among teens and children - 27%.   Graph from the National Journal There’s also good reason to think that Millennials' hard luck won’t go away soon. Besides carrying around $1 trillion in student debt, Millennials have to deal with the fact that entering a poor job market has been found to be a drag on income over one’s entire career. It's Millennials, not seniors, that are vulnerable today. Yet it's still the seniors that receive discounts on public services and benefit from price discrimination by private companies. So if you’re a twentysomething, the next time you see an adorable old lady paying less bus fare with her senior discount, demand that you receive the discount instead of her. Tell the driver it’s the screwed Millennial discount. This post was written by Alex Mayyasi. Follow him on Twitter here or Google Plus.

Google Finance100-point swings in the Dow are back. After rallying 106 points yesterday, stocks are tumbling early in the U.S. trading session. Things are quiet in the U.S. in terms of economic data. Earlier today, China's Shuanghui International announced that it would buy Smithfield Farms, America's largest pork-producer and ham-maker. Shares of Smithfield are up 25% on the news.
ReutersEarlier today we got news that Chinese companyÂ Shuanghui International Holdings Limited intends to acquire Smithfield Foods.  Smithfield is America's largest pork producer. Meanwhile Shuanghui holds a majority stake in Henan Shuanghui Investment &amp; Development Co., which is China's largest meat processing enterprise. China is the world's largest pork consumer.

Tom Friedman's latest column in The New York Times argues thatÂ employers don't care if you went to Yale: Since jobs are evolving so quickly, with so many new tools, a bachelorâ€™s degree is no longer considered an adequate proxy by employers for your ability to do a particular job â€” and, therefore, be hired. So, more employers are designing their own tests to measure applicantsâ€™ skills. And they increasingly donâ€™t care how those skills were acquired: home schooling, an online university, a massive open online course, or Yale. They just want to know one thing: Can you add value? Instead, Friedman argues, employers are turning to meritocratic recruiting methods, like the recruiting startup created by his daughter's former roommate at ...Yale. People are taking issue with the column for a few reasons, including how it serves as a "PR piece for a company run by his daughter's Yale buddies" according to one commenter at Hacker News. No one is more upset, however, than one Yale student who argues at Hacker News that Yale students really are better than everyone else. Here's why: Have people considered that "credentials and connections" are actually a valuable signaling mechanism? Connections (in the broadest sense of the word) indicate that a candidate is able to form strong personal relationships. People are not robots, and this ability goes a long way in the workforce. If you are hiring someone, you know you're going to spend the majority of your waking time with that person for the foreseeable future. So any kind of signal that this will prove a positive use of your time is a valuable one. This is not to say that other schools don't offer this mechanism. I'm simply observing that the idea of "connections" does not carry nearly as much negative weight as its connotations often imply. Similarly, credentials indicate that a candidate has conaistently passed more screening processes over a long duration of time than a company could practically present to the candidate. Consider that nobody is born into Yale (contrary to popular belief, and any exceptions to this are in the minority). To get to Yale, you effectively must pass through a fifteen year funnel. No company can match that kind of screening rigor, so why not leverage it? From a company's point of view, it would be dumb not to. (Also, think about it this way -- if you are a high school senior with a choice of any school, and therefore one of the smartest in your class, will you choose Yale or a state school? I parenthesized this because it's a straw man argument, but do consider that financial barriers to the Ivy League are basically non-existent nowadays.) Yes, you can get qualified candidates from other schools. But your chances of getting a "lemon" candidate from Yale are, I presume, much lower than getting one from another school. You know that at the very least the candidate is capable of learning quickly on the job. In many industries, especially those where most domain knowledge comes from real world experience, like finance and consulting, the ability to learn quickly is a candidates most valuable asset. If every candidate will arrive at the company with a "blank slate"of knowledge and experience, why not recruit the ones who can fill up their slate the best? This is why finance companies recruit history majors, for instance. They know that success in a liberal arts education demonstrates an ability to learn quickly (not to mention strong writing skills). I know many people on here are anti-liberal arts or anti-Ivy favoritism. Those arguments, especially the latter, have obvious validity. But I hope this post will cause you to consider the other side of the argument. Disclaimer: I go to Yale. I realize we are extremely spoiled in the job market, but I also do not necessarily think it's undeserved. It's unfortunate that other people suffer, but I do not feel like we are disproportionately favored. I think a VERY high majority of Yale students are top 1% job candidates. Everybody gets in here for a reason. IvyGate linked to this comment, calling it "a harrowing, first-person glance into Yale's meritocratic myth." We had our own brush with the hubris of Yale students last month, when Yale Law Students unilaterally declined to participate in a most impressive students list â€” with one respondent telling us: "Every one of my classmates at Yale Law School has been a true exemplar of leadership and accomplishment, and there are more fascinating life stories here than I can count." Yale really is a great school, and Friedman probably underestimates how much it helps to have Yale on your resume. If Friedman is at all right, however, then Yalies may have to come to grips with a world where they have to fight to get ahead and face competition from state school kids, dropouts, and billions of ambitious and increasingly educated foreigners.

Hectorir via FlickrOnce bankers reach a certain age and want to be true bosses in their own right, they often ask themselves — should I get my CFA or my MBA? It's a great question. While the MBA — the Masters in Business Administration — offers variety and camaraderie, the CFA — Chartered Financial Analyst — offers precision and rigor. The MBA means you take a few years and go to school (part or full time) and the CFA is a 3-level test that requires years of solitary study (and sometimes solitary failure). We've evaluated the decision making process, and presented the argument for why getting your MBA is superior. Now it's the CFA's turn.

(Reuters) - Scott London, a former senior partner with accounting firm KPMG, agreed to plead guilty to securities fraud for his involvement in insider trading, according to an announcement from the U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles. London, 50, supervised more than 500 accounting professionals at KPMG and oversaw audits of Herbalife Ltd and Skechers USA Inc , according to prosecutors. He faces a maximum term of 20 years in federal prison and a maximum fine of $5 million or twice the gross gain or gross loss resulting from his offense, according to the plea agreement. London's plea agreement comes about a week after his one-time golfing buddy Bryan Shaw pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud for his role in the scheme. London and his lawyer Harland Braun were not immediately available to comment. Shaw, a jeweler, gave London cash, an expensive watch and other gifts in exchange for tips on Herbalife, Skechers and other companies that helped him generate more than $1 million in illegal profits, according to prosecutors. Shaw sometimes gave London bags filled with cash at meetings on street corners and in parking lots, according to prosecutors. In his plea agreement, London admitted that he gave Shaw inside information regarding at least 14 separate earnings announcements or acquisitions by KPMG clients, including Herbalife's May 2, 2011 earnings announcement and United Rentals' December 16, 2011 announcement of its acquisition of RSC Holdings, according to prosecutors. Shaw agreed to pay around $1.3 million in restitution and will continue to cooperate with the government's investigation as part of his plea. London is scheduled to appear in federal court on Friday, though that will likely be pushed back, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles. Shaw, who pleaded guilty on May 20, has a sentencing hearing on September 16. Manuel Goncalves, a spokesman for KPMG, did not immediately return requests for comment.

Flickr/I Believe I Can FrySmithfield Farms, the U.S. pork producer and maker of hams, is getting acquired by Shuanghui International. Smithfield stockholders will get $34 per share. The stock is up 25% in pre-market trading. China is the world's largest producer and consumer of pork. And China's pork industry has not been without controversy.  Recently two farmers were arrested after they sold 40 tonnes of diseased pork. Also, hundreds of dead pigs were recently found floating in a river near Shanghai. Here's an excerpt from the press release: SMITHFIELD, Va. and HONG KONG, May 29, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Smithfield Foods, Inc. (SFD) and Shuanghui International Holdings Limited today announced that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement that values Smithfield at approximately US$7.1 billion, including the assumption of Smithfield's net debt. Shuanghui International is the majority shareholder of Henan Shuanghui Investment &amp; Development Co. (000895.SZ), which is China's largest meat processing enterprise and China's largest publicly traded meat products company as measured by market capitalization. Under the terms of the agreement, which has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies, Shuanghui will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Smithfield for US$34.00 per share in cash. The purchase price represents a premium of approximately 31% over Smithfield's closing stock price on May 28, 2013, the last trading day prior to today's announcement. "This is a great transaction for all Smithfield stakeholders, as well as for American farmers and U.S. agriculture," said C. Larry Pope, president and chief executive officer of Smithfield. "We have established Smithfield as the world's leading and most trusted vertically integrated pork processor and hog producer, and are excited that Shuanghui recognizes our best-in-class operations, our outstanding food safety practices and our 46,000 hard-working and dedicated employees. It will be business as usual -- only better -- at Smithfield. We do not anticipate any changes in how we do business operationally in the United States and throughout the world. We will become part of an enterprise that shares our belief in global opportunities and our commitment to the highest standards of product safety and quality. With our shared expertise and leadership, we look forward to accelerating a global expansion strategy as part of Shuanghui." "We are pleased to have reached this agreement with Smithfield, which represents a historic opportunity for both companies and their stakeholders," said Shuanghui chairman Wan Long. "Shuanghui is a leading pork producer in China and a pioneer in the Chinese meat processing industry with over 30 years of history. Smithfield is a leader in our industry and together we will be able to meet the growing demand in China for pork by importing high-quality meat products from the United States, while continuing to serve markets in the United States and around the world. The combination creates a company with an unmatched set of assets, products and geographic reach." Mr. Wan continued: "The acquisition provides Smithfield the opportunity to expand its offering of products to China through Shuanghui's distribution network. Shuanghui will gain access to high-quality, competitively-priced and safe U.S. products, as well as Smithfield's best practices and operational expertise. We were especially attracted to Smithfield for its strong management team, leading brands and vertically integrated model. We look forward to working with Larry Pope and the many talented employees at Smithfield to grow the combined company as a leading global pork and processed meat producer with the same vision and values of providing high-quality and safe products to consumers." Shuanghui is committed to continuing the long-term growth of Smithfield, and continuing to work with American farmers, producers and suppliers who have been critical to Smithfield's success. Shuanghui will continue its long-term strategy and vision to become a global leader with strict adherence to the highest standards of quality control and safety compliance. Its agreement to acquire Smithfield is fully aligned with this focus. Shuanghui will maintain the excellence in Smithfield's brands and strategic priorities. Together, Shuanghui and Smithfield will enhance their competitiveness, contributing to a more secure future for the Chinese and U.S. pork industries. Mr. Pope added, "This transaction provides Smithfield shareholders with significant and immediate cash value for their investment, and ensures that Smithfield will continue to execute on its strategic priorities while maintaining our brand excellence, community involvement, and our commitment to environmental stewardship and animal welfare. Our board of directors is pleased with the outcome of the process we followed leading to this transaction, and we unanimously believe that this combination with Shuanghui is in the best interests of the Company, our shareholders and all Smithfield stakeholders."
Julia La Roche for Business InsiderWe recently spoke to a well-connected Wall Streeter who told us the No. 1 piece of adviceÂ bankers have for new recruits. It's something that no New York summer interns are going to want to hear. Don't go to the Hamptons. Why? If you really want a job offer, then you need to spend almost every waking hour in the office that you possibly can. That also means you need to make yourself available to try new things at your firm. And if and when you do get a full-time job offer, you'll be able to enjoy the rite of passage of heading east another summer. Until then, stay in the city on the weekends.

Flickr/floweregoAfter two years of shunning Wall Street, graduates of Harvard College are heading back into finance and consulting. And judging by prior years, thatâ€™s bad news for the stock market. Among members of Harvardâ€™s class of 2013 who secured jobs before graduation, 16% are going into consulting and 15% into finance, making those the most popular industries, according to the Harvard Crimsonâ€™s annual survey. The combined 31% in finance and consulting is up sharply from 21% in 2012 and 22% in 2011. Harvardâ€™s interest in Wall Street, though, should make investors blanch. Since at least 2007, whenever the portion of Harvard College graduates choosing finance or consulting for their careers has increased, the stock market has declined the following year. The opposite is also true: when Harvard flees Wall Street, the market rebounds. In 2007, 47% of Harvard graduates went into finance or consulting. The next year was the start of the global financial crisis, and the S&amp;P 500 lost nearly half its value. The market bounced back in 2009 and 2010, after Harvardâ€™s classes of 2008 and 2009 opted for careers elsewhere. And the pattern more-or-less repeated itself in the following three years. via Quartz Of course, while there are worse theories for why markets move, the correlation of Harvard graduate career choices to the S&amp;P 500 does not imply causation. Itâ€™s as specious as a similar theory about Harvard Business School graduates.Â The relationship simply illustrates some hard truths: Harvard graduates like money, choose careers based on salary, and are terrible predictors of the future. In other words, Harvard is a trailing indicator. The average starting salary for members of Harvardâ€™s class of 2013 who have jobs is about $60,000, which is higher than the median US household income of $52,762. But the students heading to Wall Street and related fields will earn even more:Â 71% of those entering consulting will earn between $70,000 and $90,000, according to the Crimson survey, and 21% of those entering finance will make more than $110,000. Harvardâ€™s class of 2013 isnâ€™t planning to stay in those industries, though. Only 5% expects to be working in finance in 10 years, and just 1% see themselves in consulting.

REUTERS/Jason LeeA vendor cuts up a piece of pork in her stall at a market in Beijing, January 11, 2013.Good morning. Here's what you need to know.
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — The hoopla surrounding the return of "Arrested Development" on Netflix's Internet video service has quickly dissolved into a letdown on Wall Street. Netflix's stock fell by more than 6 percent Tuesday as investors reacted to critics' mixed reviews over the weekend of the first new "Arrested Development" episodes since Fox canceled the TV series seven years ago. The shares shed $14.55 to close at $214.19, marking the biggest one-day drop in the stock in nearly six months. IDC analyst Greg Ireland characterized Tuesday's sell-off as an overreaction, given that it's far too early to know whether Netflix's latest high-profile foray into original programming will turn out to be a hit or a flop for the company. That determination probably won't be made until late July, when Netflix Inc. typically announces the number of subscribers it added during the April-June period. Netflix declined Tuesday to disclose any information about how many and how much subscribers have watched "Arrested Development" since all 15 new episodes were released at once early Sunday morning. The mass debut made it possible for Netflix's 29.2 million U.S. subscribers to watch as many episodes as they wanted during the holiday weekend as part of their $8-a-month subscription fee. Many people opted to view them all at once rather than space them out over weeks or months. "Arrested Development" is the third original series to debut on Netflix this year, but it has attracted far more attention than the others because of its built-in fan base and a popular cast, which includes Jason Bateman and Michael Cera. Netflix also raised hopes for "Arrested Development" by predicting the series could help add as many as 880,000 U.S. subscribers to the online video service during the three months ending in June. That would be 350,000 more subscribers than the service gained during the same stretch last year. It's traditionally a sluggish period for the company because more people are on vacation and doing things outdoors instead of spending a lot of time watching video. The Los Gatos, Calif., company didn't make any of the new "Arrested Development" episodes available for advance viewing. That made it impossible to know ahead of time whether the series retained the same quirky humor and appeal that won the show critical acclaim, Emmy awards and a devoted fan base during its three-year run on Fox and its subsequent distribution on Internet video services such as Netflix. Once they saw the resurrected "Arrested Development," some influential critics panned it as a disappointment. The New York Times was particularly harsh, asserting that Netflix had "killed" the series. Variety was only slightly kinder in describing the revival as "an interesting idea that was more exciting on paper." But many other critics hailed the new episodes for being just as good, if not better, than the show's original incarnation. "The comedic payout begins to multiply with each succeeding episode," asserted The Hollywood Reporter's Tim Goodman, who recommended watching the new season at least twice to get all the jokes. Other reviewers in daily newspapers scattered across the country also praised the series. As of late Tuesday afternoon, "Arrested Development" had received a 72 rating on a scale of 100, based on 10 professional reviews analyzed by Metacritic.com. That compared with a rating of 76 for the political drama "House of Cards" and 46 for the thriller "Hemlock Grove," the other Netflix-financed series released on the service this year. Metacritic considers a rating of 61 to 80 to be signifying "generally favorable reviews." The opinions of the critics ultimately won't matter if Netflix's subscribers are enjoying the new episodes of "Arrested Development," Janney Montgomery Scott analyst Tony Wible said. The show becomes "almost like a marketing vehicle for Netflix" as satisfied customers keep their subscriptions and help create a buzz that attracts new subscribers, Wible said. Just a whiff of negative sentiment about "Arrested Development" was enough to spook Wall Street. Many investors have been betting that the series will accelerate Netflix's subscriber growth and provide further validation of the company's decision to spend about $200 million annually on original programming in an effort to make its Internet video service as compelling as any broadcast or cable TV network. The buildup to "Arrested Development" helped Netflix's stock recover from a backlash to price increases and proposed service changes announced nearly two years ago. The stock plummeted from nearly $305 in July 2011 to below $53 last August. Even with Tuesday's sharp decline, Netflix's stock has more than doubled in value so far this year. The run-up has left investors paying about $144 for every $1 in Netflix's projected earnings this year compared with $23 for every $1 in anticipated earnings for Google, the Internet's most powerful company. Netflix's lofty valuation means the slightest stumble can cause many investors to dump their shares, Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said. "It's a stock that is priced for perfection," he said. A sampling of traffic Sunday indicated that "Arrested Development" got off to a positive start, despite the misgivings of some critics. Procera Networks, which provides Internet traffic management for broadband providers, estimated that about one-third of the Netflix subscribers it monitored watched at least one episode of "Arrested Development." Procera monitors traffic for several major broadband providers, though it doesn't identify which ones. The traffic for "Arrested Development" was far better than the 11 percent of Netflix subscribers who watched at least one episode of "House of Cards" during its debut weekend in February, according to Procera. Netflix credited the popularity of "House of Cards" for helping its service add 2 million U.S. subscribers during the first three months of this year, about 250,000 more than the same time last year. About 10 percent of the Netflix subscribers monitored by Procera finished the entire season of "Arrested Development" on Sunday. "I would call that a numbers success, regardless of critical acclaim," Cam Cullen, Procera's vice president of global marketing, wrote Tuesday in a blog post. Copyright (2013) Associated Press.

In early May I had the pleasure of attending and speaking at the Value Investing Congress in Las Vegas. The last time I had spoken there, it was May 2008 and the market was just coming off its top.â€Š The Standard &amp; Poorâ€™s 500 index was trading at 18 times trailing earnings. Profit margins were at a modern-day high. They subsequently collapsed but came back to set an even higher high. If you normalize profits for high margins and look at ten-year trailing earnings, in 2008 stocks were trading 66 percent above their average. They were at 30 times ten-year trailing earnings. In all honesty, I could do the same presentation today that I did five years ago, since market valuation is not dramatically different from what it was then. A cyclical bear and a cyclical bull market later, the S&amp;P 500 is at (the same) 18 times trailing earnings and 26 times ten-year trailing earnings. Investors who were on the sidelines the past few years and who are now pouring money into stocks, expecting that we are in the midst of a secular bull market, will likely be disappointed. The previous sideways market, of 1966â€“82, included four cyclical bull markets and five cyclical bear markets. From 1970 to 1973 the Dow went from 700 to 1,000, just to drop again, to 600. Sideways markets are there to destroy hope. It is when nobody wants to own stocks ever again, when valuations are below their historical average, that a secular sideways market finally dies (actually, more like goes into hibernation), and the next secular bull market is born. But even that is not enough: Stocks need to spend time at below-average valuations. In the 1966â€“82 market they spent half of their time at below-average valuations. During the recent crisis we tiptoed into below-average valuations, but we danced right back out. To believe we are in the midst of a secular bull market, you have to be very comfortable with three things, starting with profit margins. Today corporate profit margins are hitting all-time highs. Historically, profit margins have been mean-reverting â€” high margins were never sustained by corporations over a prolonged period of time because, as legendary value investor Jeremy Grantham puts it, â€œcapitalism works.â€ â€ŠWhen a company â€” Apple, for example â€” starts earning very high margins, its competitors (like Samsung) come in with lower prices. In response, Apple must lower its margins. If margins decline even as the economy grows, earnings growth will be very benign or negative.

REUTERS / Gus RuelasRupert Murdoch, April 29, 2013.(Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch tried to convince Wall Street on Tuesday that there is still money to be made in newspapers, reminding investors that he had defied skeptics over the past 60 years to build one of the world's biggest media empires. As News Corp prepares to separate its publishing business from its entertainment assets, Murdoch said that while some brands face individual challenges, as a whole the publishing portfolio is "undervalued and underdeveloped." "I am not saying I didn't make many mistakes along the way —even some spectacular ones," Murdoch said at a meeting in Manhattan to sell investors on the new publishing company. "You may be wondering why I want to do it all over again," the 82-year-old media mogul said. "The simple answer is: there is opportunity everywhere." The new publishing company, which will retain the News Corp name, officially kicks off on June 28 with properties such as: The Wall Street Journal, Dow Jones Newswires, The Times of London, Australian pay-TV services, book publisher HarperCollins and fledgling education unit, Amplify. The spin-off comes as newspapers face plunging advertising revenue and readers who increasingly prefer to get news for free on their smartphones and tablets. Shares of newspaper companies - once considered blue-chip investments - have tumbled over the past decade as investors fear a permanent drain in ad sales. Against this backdrop, the publishing company's new chief executive, Robert Thomson, said there will be "relentless" cost cuts in store for the business. He gave no specifics. News Corp executives took pains to note almost half of the publishing company's revenue comes from sources other than advertising. One revenue source is Dow Jones, which sells news and information to financial institutions and competes with Thomson Reuters Corp and Bloomberg LP. Dow Jones CEO Lex Fenwick highlighted the introduction of a new platform, code-named DJ X. He emphasized one product, one price and one standard contract. "If we can take a little more of institutional spend with DJ X - if we deliver that product with real value, there's a real opportunity to increase our market share," he said. Fenwick also said Dow Jones is working on a messaging platform to compete with Bloomberg's vaunted product. CLEAN BALANCE SHEET Thomson, a close confident of Murdoch, ensured the new publishing company would start out with a clean balance sheet, no debt and $2 billion in cash to buffer operations and attract investors. News Corp intends to pay a dividend, but the board has yet to determine the details. It said it has authorized a share buyback of $500 million. Still, analysts wanted to know if Murdoch intended to go shopping with his coffer of cash especially where newspapers assets are concerned - including the Los Angeles Times and the Chicago Tribune that are on the market. Murdoch said if the "price is right" News Corp could be interested in newspapers. But he said that cross-ownership rules that prevent companies from owning top TV stations and newspapers in the same market made it "pretty unlikely." News Corp said last Friday that it would write down the value of its Australian and U.S. publishing assets by up to $1.4 billion, potentially wiping out the company's estimated profit for the quarter ending June 30. Thomson said the company will have "a permanent start-up sensibility." He added, "We will be relentless in our cost-cutting and in our pursuit of profits." The new News Corp also unveiled its logo - written in a cursive script based on the handwriting of Murdoch and his father, Keith, whose Australian newspapers were the seeds of the media empire. The Fox network, the movie studio and a set of lucrative cable properties will become a separately traded company called 21st Century Fox. "I have been given an extraordinary opportunity most people never get in their lifetime: the chance to do it all over again," said Murdoch.

Warren Buffett will tell you that his investment career began in the 1940s when he bought shares in a company as an 11-year-old. However, there isn't much footage of the Oracle of Omaha available before the 1980s. Reformed Broker Josh Brown points us to this rare 1962 interview with Buffett on ValueWalk.com. In this brief clip, Buffett discusses the predictive power of the stock market. "The stock market has been a good forecaster from time to time in the past," he said.  "It also has been a rather poor forecaster occasionally." He addressed an ongoing sell-off in the stock market. "For example, the last four or five years, the stock market has been booming along presumably forecasting better business which has really not materialized," he said.  "So maybe the stock market is correcting a previously incorrect forecast this time."

REUTERS/U.S. Air Force/Lt Col Leslie PrattA MQ-1 Predator dronePESHAWAR,Â PakistanÂ (Reuters) - A U.S. drone strike killed the number two of the PakistaniÂ TalibanÂ in the North Waziristan region on Wednesday, three security officials said, in what would be a major blow in the fight against militancy. The drone strike killed seven people, Pakistani security officials said, includingÂ TalibanÂ deputy commander Wali-ur-Rehman, in the first such attack since a May 11 general election in which the use of the unmanned aircraft was a major issue. Wali-ur-RehmanÂ had been poised to succeedÂ Hakimullah MehsudÂ as leader of the PakistaniÂ Taliban, a senior army official based in the South Waziristan region, had said in December. "This is a huge blow to militants and a win in the fight against insurgents," one security official told Reuters, declining further comment. The PakistaniÂ TalibanÂ are a separate entity allied to the AfghanÂ Taliban. Known as the Tehreek-e-TalibanPakistanÂ (TTP), they have launched devastating attacks against theÂ Pakistani militaryÂ and civilians. PakistaniÂ TalibanÂ spokesmanÂ Ihsanullah IhsanÂ told Reuters the group did not have "confirmed reports" that Wali-ur-RehmanÂ had been killed. He declined further comment. Drone casualties are difficult to verify. Foreign journalists must have permission from the military to visit the Pashtun tribal areas along the Afghan border. TalibanÂ fighters also often seal off the sites of drone strikes immediately so Pakistani journalists cannot see the victims. "That theÂ TalibanÂ are remaining silent and neither denying or confirming the news is itself peculiar," saidÂ Saleem Safi, a Pakistani expert on theÂ Taliban. "But if this news is true, then theÂ Pakistan armyÂ has the U.S. to thank." The security officials and Pashtun tribesmen in the northwestern region said the drone fired two missiles that struck a mud-built house atÂ ChashmaÂ village, 3 km (2 miles) east of Miranshah, the region's administrative town. They said seven people were killed and four wounded. FOREIGN MINISTRYÂ DENOUNCES DRONES "Tribesmen started rescue work an hour after the attack and recovered seven bodies," said residentÂ Bashir Dawar. "The bodies were badly damaged and beyond recognition." TheÂ Pakistan governmentÂ had yet to confirm Wali-ur-Rehman's death. A U.S. drone killed PakistaniÂ TalibanÂ commanderÂ Baitullah MehsudÂ in 2009. There had been several reports that his successor,Â Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed the same way but they turned out to be untrue. But theÂ Foreign MinistryÂ again denounced drones in general on Wednesday. "The government has consistently maintained that the drone strikes are counter-productive, entail loss of innocent civilian lives, have human rights and humanitarian implications and violate the principles of national sovereignty, territorial integrity and international law," it said. U.S. PresidentÂ Barack ObamaÂ recently indicated he was scaling back the drone strike program, winning cautious approval fromÂ Pakistan, a key ally in the U.S. fight on militancy. North Waziristan is on the Afghan border and has long been a stronghold of militants including AfghanÂ Talibanand their al Qaeda and PakistaniÂ TalibanÂ allies. Prime Minister-electÂ Nawaz SharifÂ said this month that drone strikes were a "challenge" toÂ Pakistan's sovereignty. "We will sit with our American friends and talk to them about this issue," he said. Obama's announcement of scaling back drone strikes was widely welcomed by the people of North Waziristan, where drones armed with missiles have carried out the most strikes against militants over the past seven years, sometimes with heavy civilian casualties. The strike also coincided with the first session of the newly elected provincial assembly of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the former Northwest Frontier Province. Former cricketerÂ Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehrik-e-Insaf partyÂ won most seats in the assembly and denounced the strike, saying Obama had gone back on his word.

AFP/GettyIt was the final obstacle, the 40 feet of technical climbing up a near vertical rock face that pushed Sir Edmund Hillary to the limit. Once climbed, the way to the summit of Mount Everest lay open. Now, almost exactly 60 years after the New Zealander and his rope-mate, Sherpa Tenzing Norgay, stood on the highest point in the planet, a new plan has been mooted to install a ladder on the famous Hillary Step, as the crucial pitch at nearly 29,000ft has been known since it was first ascended. The aim is to ease congestion. "We are now discussing putting a ladder on the Hillary Step but it is obviously controversial," said Dawa Steven Sherpa, who runs commercial expeditions on Everest and is a senior member of the Expedition Operators Association in Nepal. This year, 520 climbers have reached the summit of Everest. On 19 May, around 150 climbed the last 3,000ft of the peak from Camp IV within hours of each other, causing lengthy delays as mountaineers queued to descend or ascend harder sections. "Most of the traffic jams are at the Hillary Step because only one person can go up or down. If you have people waiting two, three or even four hours that means lots of exposure [to risk]. To make the climbing easier, that would be wrong. But this is a safety feature," said Sherpa, who co-ordinates the work to prepare the traditional route up the mountain for clients who pay between $45,000 and $75,000. The plan has received some support from the world's mountaineering authorities. Frits Vrijlandt, the president of the International Mountaineering and Climbing Federation (UIAA), said the ladder could be a solution to the increasing numbers of climbers on the mountain. "It's for the way down, so it won't change the climb," Vrijlandt told the Guardian. It is unlikely, however, that tired ascending climbers close to their ultimate goal will spurn such an obvious aid at such an altitude. After the climb, Hillary described his concern at seeing the steep cliff so high on the mountain during the first ascent. He managed to climb it using a crack to one side. Tenzing Norgay followed and the pair continued to the summit. The news of the successful ascent by the British expedition reached London in time for Queen Elizabeth's coronation three days later. There are also plans to introduce more rigorous traffic controls on the so-called fixed ropes, which run almost from base camp to the summit and are fixed by specialist sherpas. One rope for climbers on the way up and one for those descending are to be installed. But though such innovations are anathema to many purist climbers, they are welcomed by some sherpas. Paid around $7,000 for guiding a client to the summit, the sherpas, almost all from local villages, are regular casualties on the mountain. Nine people have died on Everest this year, including two veteran sherpas. A brawl involving western climbers and sherpas at over 20,000ft on the peak made headlines. Apa Sherpa, who climbed Everest a record 21 times before retiring in 2011, described the Hillary Step as "very hard" and said a ladder was a good idea. Pertemba Sherpa, who played a key role in the British expedition led by Sir Chris Bonington, which climbed Everest's south-west face for the first time in 1975, said that the security of the sherpas working on the mountain should be paramount. "The route is changing, there is more rock, less ice and snow. it's very dangerous. For [the] safety of sherpas, this is good," the 65-year-old said. Many Sherpas and other Nepalis want to develop the industry of guiding clients to the top with minimal risk to all involved, while many mountaineers want to preserve Everest as a climbing challenge that demands a significant level of experience, technical competence and acceptance of risk. "The mountain has become a commodity, to be bought and sold like any other," Stephen Venables, the first Briton to climb Everest without oxygen, told the Guardian. One further suggestion is for the Nepali authorities to vet climbers to ensure they have a basic level of competence. "We must be inclusive but Mount Everest is not a place for training people who only know ice as cubes in a glass in how to use an ice axe and crampons," said Vrijlandt, the UIAA president.

A survey of retailers out of the UK is UGLY. From CBI.org.uk, here's the announcement. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 29th May 2013 Retail sales fell at their fastest rate in more than a year in May, according to the CBIâ€™s latest monthly Distributive Trades Survey.  The survey of 69 retailing firms saw the steepest fall in annual sales since January last year â€“ showing growth in retail activity has weakened persistently during 2013. Overall sales volumes remained below average for the time of year and orders fell faster than at any point since November 2011.Â  The detailed findings show that grocery sales were broadly flat on a year ago, reversing last monthâ€™s rise. There were falls in sales across most other sub-sectors, including clothing and footwear. Retailers are reporting a slightly brighter outlook, expecting sales to rise modestly next month and the business situation to improve over the next quarter. But firms are planning to scale back their investment for the year ahead â€“ with investment intentions now the weakest since the start of last year. Barry Williams, Asda Chief Merchandising Office for Food and Chair of the CBI Distributive Trades Survey Panel said: â€œRetail sales growth has weakened since the start of the year as households continue to feel the pinch, with wages failing to keep pace with the cost of living. â€œThere is positivity from retailers this month, however, with sales expected to rise in the coming months.â€ The survey was conducted between 24th April and 15Â­th May 2013. Key findings: The survey also heard from 57 wholesalers and 11 motor traders. 28% of wholesalers reported sales volumes to be up on last year and 34% said they were down, giving a balance of -6% - in line with expectations and driven in part by the fastest decline in food &amp; drink sales since February 2009. However, wholesalers expect sales to rise solidly next month (+22%) and expect to raise investment marginally in the year ahead (+5%). 56% of motor traders reported sales volumes to be up on a year earlier and 37% said they were down, giving a rounded balance of +18% and undershooting expectations of stronger growth (+53%). 1. Firms responding to the Distributive Trades Survey (DTS) are responsible for a third of employment in retailing. The survey includes measures of sales activity across the distributive trades. It was first introduced in 1983 and the retail results form the UK component of the EC survey of retail trades. 2. The survey was conducted between 24th April and 15th May. 137 firms took part, of which 69 were retailers, 57 were wholesalers and 11 motor traders. 3. A balance is the difference between the percentage of retailers reporting an increase and those reporting a decrease. 4. The latest Asda Income Tracker was published on 27th May 2013 â€“ showing household spending power at a 12 month low as wage growth sees steepest decline since the start of 2008:

Time & Life Pictures/Getty Images* Euro zone seen mired in recession with 0.6 pct contraction * Boosted by monetary easing, U.S and Japan to lead recovery * Euro zone warned against becoming complacent as risks ease PARIS, May 29 (Reuters) - The recession-hit euro zone will fall further behind a generally improving United States and a rebounding Japan this year, the OECD said on Wednesday, cutting its global growth forecasts. In its twice-yearly Economic Outlook, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development forecast the world economy would grow 3.1 percent this year before accelerating to 4 percent in 2014. The estimates marked a slightly more pessimistic view after in November the Paris-based think tank forecast global growth of 3.4 percent this year and 4.2 percent next year. The United States was seen driving global growth with the world's biggest economy projected to expand 1.9 percent this year and then accelerating to 2.8 percent in 2014, which would be the country's best rate since 2005. In contrast, the euro zone was estimated to remain in recession for a second year. The OECD sees its economy contracting 0.6 percent in 2013 and then returning to growth next year with a rate of 1.1 percent. However, the outlook diverged widely within the 17-nation bloc with regional powerhouse Germany seen achieving growth of 0.4 percent and rebounding to a rate of 1.9 percent in 2014. After years of debt crisis testing the euro zone's capacity to hold together, OECD chief economist Pier Paolo Padoan said that risks to the economic outlook have finally begun to recede. However, he warned that the easing in the euro zone's debt crisis may lead to reform fatigue. "As far as Europe is considered, we are concerned that complacency could set in," Padoan told Reuters. "That is a new risk that is coming up in Europe." Unlike the United States in the 2008-09 financial crisis, the euro zone still needed to tackle problems in its financial sector holding back the flow of credit, he said. CENTRAL BANK STIMULUS Lifting its estimate for Japan, the OECD said that the central bank's pledge to ramp up its monetary stimulus aggressively would help its economy grow 1.6 percent this year. The OECD took a more pessimistic view on China, forecasting that its economy would grow 7.8 percent this year, down from a previous estimate of 8.5 percent. With economies in most countries still in recovery mode, the OECD said central banks should keep monetary policies easy while the European Central Bank should even dramatically step up its efforts to get credit flowing to the economy. The OECD called on the ECB to make banks pay for holding deposits with it and urged it to buy assets such as securitised loans from credit-starved small and medium-sized firms, two options ECB policymakers say they are currently considering. In the case of the U.S. Federal Reserve, the OECD said it may soon be justified to begin curbing its purchases of government bonds and mortgage-backed securities However, it warned that a slower pace of purchases would have to be carefully flagged to markets in order to avoid an abrupt sell-off by other investors that might cause yields to spike dangerously higher. The OECD not only gave its blessing to the Bank of Japan's dramatic increase in monetary surplus but said further moves could be used to boost the economy. It noted improvement in Britain's pace of fiscal consolidation in both 2013 and 2014, but repeated the concern mentioned by the International Monetary Fund last week that a Help to Buy programme might end up pushing house prices up.

As David Rosenberg mentions in his most recent note, the idea of a correction has now become the contrarian case with almost everyone expecting a continued rally, or a correction to be met with a â€œbuy the dipâ€ mentality as the Fed jumps to the rescue to any market decline.Â  So yes, we all know the bull view and how right it has been for so long. Â That said, he cites 4 reasons to be concerned in his latest note: Now, please feel free to use the comments section to mock the idea that a stock market can go downâ€¦.
Here's something you might not have noticed or thought about if you're not in the market for a new home. Mortgage rates have been shooting up. M&amp;G investments notes that Wells Fargo just upped its rates to 4% and that rates have been shooting up. M&G Investments The rise in rates in the US is a good sign. It means the market is anticipating a recovery, and that monetary policy is starting to yield some juice. But this is still interesting to watch. Let's see how long it will fake for this to really bleed through into the general media, and we start getting stories about how a once-in-a-lifetime chance to buy a home is about to pass you by.
The big chatter these days in Europe has to do with easing up on austerity, and even, gasp, seeing some fiscal stimulus out of Germany. Why has it taken this long? Because it took this long for the German economy to finally start to wobble. But now there are increasing signs that it's happening. From Bloomberg's Stefan Riecher: The number of people out of work climbed a seasonally adjusted 21,000 to 2.96 million, the Nuremberg-based Federal Labor Agency said today. Thatâ€™s the fourth straight monthly gain. Economists predicted an increase of 5,000, according to the median of 35 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. The adjusted jobless rate held at 6.9 percent, just above a two-decade low of 6.8 percent. Remember, the big trend is that while Europe collapses, the German employment picture has looked absolutely fantastic throughout the crisis. Natixis So there's been no impetus to change the status quo. But if the German situation stops looking so hot, then that changes things.
After yesterday's screaming rally around the world, today is decidedly weaker. Markets are off everywhere. In Europe, Italy is off 0.6%, France is off 0.9%, and Germany is down 0.8%. US futures are all pointing to a lower open. And the big story again is Japan, where markets can't get any love. After ending the normal trading day flat, Nikkei futures have continued to crumble all morning, as you can see in this chart via FinViz: FinViz The ongoing weakness in the Nikkei, which was can't-lose just a few days ago, is clearly the most interesting story in world markets, as it coincides with the Abenomics experiment, which is the most interesting economics experiment in the world.
