AP Photo/WABC-TVA train out of Grand Central Terminal headed for New Haven derailed Friday during rush hour and clipped a train traveling in the opposite direction. Two Metro-North trains collidedÂ Friday evening in Connecticut, leaving 60 people injured, five who are in serious condition,Â The New York Times reports.Â  An eastbound train traveling from Grand Central Terminal to New Haven derailed near Bridgeport, Conn. shortly after 6 p.m., striking a train heading in the opposite direction and causing the first car of that train to also run off the track. Metro-North has suspended service between South Norwalk and New Haven until further notice.Â  Two tracks where the incident occurred sustained "extensive infrastructure damage," and the overhead wire has also been damaged,Â the MTA wrote on their website.The train cars will need to be removed by crane, but notÂ until the on-scene investigation is complete, the MTA said. Â  Meanwhile all Amtrak service between New York and Boston has been suspended. Below is a photo of the train tweeted byÂ Denis J. O'Malley, a reporter for theÂ Connecticut Post: Twitter
FA Insights is a daily newsletter fromÂ Business InsiderÂ that delivers the top news and commentary for financial advisors. The Reason Financial Geniuses Are Becoming Rare (Advisor One)  In its May newsletter, investment firm Research Affiliates says financial geniuses are rare â€“ just as scientific geniuses like Einstein are â€“ and they may be becoming rarer. The firm "worries that the pace of financial genius could be mirroring a slowdown in the natural sciences, where the vast amount of knowledge required to reach the conceptual frontier has become harder than ever to attain," writes Advisor One's Gil Weinreich. In other words, the path to innovation is longer than ever. The solution, says Research Affiliates, is maintaining a collegial atmosphere where all investment ideas, no matter how outlandish, receive critical evaluation. You Don't Need To Worry About The Strong Pace Of Bond Issuance Just Yet (Charles Schwab)  Corporate bond issuance has surged on the back of low interest rates and strong demand. But Charles Schwab doesn't think that there's reason to worry just yet. This is because 1. This hasn't been accompanied by a rise in mergers &amp; acquisitions and corporate leverage, if that were to happen it would be worrisome.Â  "We think most firms are still taking advantage of low interest rates to reduce their interest expense and extend their maturities. We haven't seen a marked increase in mergers and acquisitions or shareholder-friendly activities just yet, and corporate leverage remains well below pre-crisis levels, according to aggregate data on the S&amp;P500Â®. However, we think an increase in leverage or in bond issuance to fund acquisitions would be more worrisome." The Stock Market Today Is Almost Nothing Like It Was In 2000 (Oppenheimer) On Thursday, Josh Brown wrote that the stock market is nothing like it wasÂ  in 2000 and one crucial difference is the P/E ratio. Oppenheimer's John Stoltzfus has a chart that shows the S&amp;P 500 and its P/E ratio. This shows us that stocks are cheaper today than they were then, earnings are higher, and the real (inflation-adjusted) price of the stock market is about 20% lower than in 2000. Oppenheimer  Create An Office That Impresses Clients (Financial Planning) Financial advisor Ron Carson writes about how an experience in a shabby dentists' office made him rethink the atmosphere he created in his own office for clients. "As advisors, we have to be reminded there is more to communicating than what comes out of our mouths," says Carson. "The way you invite visitors, the ambiance of your office, and the way you and your team dress are all ways of sending a message without speaking." Carson offers a few tips for how to upgrade your office, dress for the occasion, be aware of your tone, and avoid distractions. Tom Lee Thinks The S&amp;P 500 Is Going To 1715 (JP Morgan) This has been a better bull market than we expected, particularly in 2013. But this is conforming to historyâ€”the average gain in the fifth year of a bull market is 19% (implies 1,719). The S&amp;P 500 closed on 5/16 at 1,650, above our original target of 1,580, thus we are raising our YE target to 1,715, based on a 14.7x P/E on our 2014E EPS of $117. We realize investors are apprehensive about making fresh money purchases, but we see the risk/reward as particularly attractive in Technology, Health care, and Financials.
Business Insider, St. Louis FedCorporate profits as a percentage of US GDPCorporate profits have been on the rise for some years now, but wages are stagnant, at best.  That's best illustrated by these two charts, showing the trends in corporate profits as a percentage of GDP, compared to wages. Business Insider, St. Louis FedWages as a percentage of US GDPCaterpillar, the world's largest manufacturer of mining and capital equipment, is a good example of this trend.  The company has a notoriously difficult relationship with labor, recently closing and moving a factory in Ontario after union representatives refused a 50% pay cut, cutting benefits at a Joliet, Illinois, factory causing a strike last year, and currently fighting workers at a Milwaukee plant. These might seem like the actions of a struggling company. But save for the 2008 downturn, Caterpillar has been in pretty good shape.  In Mina Kime's feature on the company for Bloomberg Businessweek, current Caterpillar CEO Doug Oberhelman broke down why the company takes such a hard line: “We have to be competitive if we’re gonna win. And frankly, if we’re not competitive<U+2009>…<U+2009>we’re not gonna be here in the next 30 years. That’s a simple message, but” — he starts to hammer his hand against the table, punctuating his words with raps — “it’s very<U+2009><U+2009>…<U+2009>very<U+2009>…<U+2009>tough.” After a pause, he lets his hand lay flat. “I always try to communicate to our people that we can never make enough money,” Oberhelman continues. “We can never make enough profit.”  That's a great business answer. But it ignores the human reality of constantly pushing wages and benefits downward.  Kimes highlights the disconnect with an interesting anecdote. During the strike in Joliet, workers were invited to a meeting with the CEO. One employee asked when hourly workers could expect a raise, and Oberhelman responded by using his salary as an example about competitive wages, pointing out that he makes less than the CEOs at some smaller competitors. That employee, a single father who says he hasn't gotten a raise in over a decade, was "stunned." The company argues that it needs to plan for the possibility of hard times ahead. Manufacturing companies routinely complain that there's not enough skilled labor. However, there's not much incentive to devote your life to manufacturing if wages remain extremely low. There's also an ongoing effort to reform the public view of manufacturing from providing low paying jobs that leave you with dirty fingernails to something more technical and almost white collar. There are some of those jobs, but a hostile relationship with workers is no way to attract them. It's an paradox. A growing company creates more jobs and more welfare. And wages need to stay low enough that companies aren't forced to move outside the United States to remain competitive. But there's a difference between doing what you need to do to beat the competition, and treating workers like they're an expense to be minimized for the good of shareholders. At the end of the day, wages aren't going to go up until growth is strong enough to demand it, Oberhelman says. That kind of growth would be good for both companies' bottom lines and workers' wallets. 
San Diego real estate god Jim Klinge points us to this map showing the three year price changes for all U.S. metros from Mortgage News Daily. On balance, more areas are growing than not. Texas, southern California and south Florida are all particularly strong. Declines are largely concentrated in the northwest and southeast. Â  But Klinge warns the trend will not continue: ...the strong investor demand for foreclosed properties, record levels of housing affordability and other demand factors that have driven recent double-digit price gains are unlikely to persist throughout the year.

In a letter to investors, SAC Capital said that it would no longer cooperate with the government unconditionally regarding an ongoing investigation into its trading activity, says the NYT. In short — Steve Cohen's firm is done playing nice and helping the Justice Department and SEC in its probe into alleged insider trading at the hedge fund. From NYT: “In the past we have tried to be as transparent with you as possible about the state of the investigation while balancing our desire for transparency with the need to keep the details of a sensitive investigation confidential,” said the letter. “While we have in the past told you of our cooperation with the government’s investigation our cooperation is no longer unconditional and we do not intend to give updates in this area going forward.” SAC is going where it's clients can't follow — at least for now. The letter goes on to say that in the coming months, the firm expects to be able to divulge more information about what's going on with the investigation. This comes after SAC agreed to pay a $616 million fine to the SEC for illegal trading in pharmaceutical stocks. The hedge fund did not admit wrongdoing.
Arnold's plan, Reagan writes, is to take on massive societal problems, like obesity and criminal justice reform, over the long haul, rather than focus on short-term giving. Here's one example of what it looks like: ...the Laura and John Arnold Foundation is bankrolling a $26 million nutrition study by Attia's nonprofit, an effort that involves the use of metabolic chambers and that Attia likes to call "the Manhattan Project of obesity Reagan also has a pretty funny description of Arnold himself: Arnold, who turns 40 next year, is clean-cut and politeâ€”he is the sort of man many Southern mothers hope their daughters will bring home, even if his net worth didn't include nine zeroes. If you ran into him in one of the recreational soccer leagues where he has been known to play on the weekends, you would likely think he was an accountant or the manager of a rental-car agency, not a hedge-fund titan. Anyway, a colleague of Arnold calls his plan the "Moneyball" approach to giving â€” using large volumes of data to better allocate charitable funds. Check out the full thing on WSJ.com &gt;

2nd rule of Wall Street: You DO NOT talk to ANYONE about what goes on here.  3rd rule of Wall Street: If someone stops out, gets a margin call, or goes broke - it is over.  4th rule of Wall Street: Only two counterparties to a trade.  5th rule of Wall Street: One monster trade at a time.  6th rule of Wall Street: Fancy shirts, fancy shoes.  7th rule of Wall Street: Trades will go on as long as they have to.  8th rule of Wall Street: If this is your first day on Wall Street, you HAVE to trade. Bloomberg LP, as a financial services company, broke rule 1 (and 2) when they let Bloomberg News, a journalistic entity snoop on traders, banks, brokers - and even Central Bankers.  Bloomberg as a company has been a phenomenal growth story, much like Apple, in which there was really no other alternative in the market place (sorry Reuters, but it's true). Also, much like Apple, Bloomberg is a notoriously difficult company to deal with - complete with 24 month lock-in and an over $20,000 per year per user cost. Typically the only way to get out of a Bloomberg contract is to go out of business.   However, much like Apple, it seems like this growth and market power might be peaking. Case in point: * NY Post recently reported that Goldman Sachs is looking to build its own chatting system * Today CNBC is reporting that Citi has banned its traders from attending Bloomberg chat groups (a key feature of the terminal) These are just the two stories we know of. Imagine how many stories like these we don't know of. This is what I think will happen: For the next years, the growth at Bloomberg will slow down and it's 300,000+ userbase will eventually start to shrink.  In the meantime, a number of new proprietary services will rise up inside the different banks. However, the new terminal of choice is most likely not Reuters, but some other service we don't know of - that might not even be a service at this point.  This new service will probably be of MUCH lower cost, similar capabilities, more openness and much other cool stuff we can't think of. All I know is, I no longer long for a Bloomberg terminal. At least, not that much. For us independent guys, $20,000 per year is a complete no-go. It's good. But it's not that good.  So in five years from now, maybe we look back at this moment as when Bloomberg stopped being the unbelievably dominant force it is. PS: If you think the first and second rules of Wall Street seem like a joke, they are not. They are used as part of the the training at one of the biggest banks in the world.
Robert Libetti/ Business InsiderA bit over a month ago we polled Business Insider's Wall Street readers to find out where bankers, traders, and the like really enjoy grabbing a meal. After letting the survey marinate for a bit, a winner began to emerge — Del Frisco's Restaurant. To be honest, we were a little shocked. Del Frisco's is a Texas-based a chain, and it's not the most expensive or flashy (Remember: this is Wall Street) restaurant in NYC. So why, in a town chock-full of the newest this and the most expensive that, was Del Frisco's selected? Business Insider decided to head over to the restaurant to find out why. The main reason is this — Del Frisco's is a service driven restaurant. Unlike a lot of NYC spots, the chef is not in charge, you are. Anything you want, just ask manager Scott Gould and he'll make sure you walk out happy. Of course, that means management makes a lot of tweaks to ensure that every diner's experience is completely enjoyable. We've narrowed in on some of the Wall Street specific measures, but we're fairly sure that these are things anyone can appreciate.
BESTST0RYWINS / YouTubeOne of Morgan Stanley's investment strategists, Gerard Minack, is retiring. This is a bummer. Minack's work was lucid and helpful. But as a parting gift to clients, Minack wrote a two-page farewell note that contains the best investment advice you will likely ever receive. What is this investment advice? Now, before you go scrutinizing Minack's note to find these bullet points, let me be the first to say that Minack does not actually explicitly articulate this advice. Rather, he just demonstrates conclusively why any other investment strategy is idiotic. For starters, Minack points out that, in the average year, 60% of actively managed mutual funds underperform their benchmark. This means that, in any given year, you have a 40% chance of picking a fund that will beat the market. So if you try to pick a fund that will do this, the odds are already against you. Then Minack notes that, over the 3-year period through 2012, a staggering 87% of funds lagged the market--a percentage of failure that is similar to the percentage in most three-year periods. This means that, if you plan to hold your investment for 3 or more years, you have about a 1 in 9 chance of picking a fund that will beat the market. Those are truly awful odds. And it gets worse. If you are like most people, in addition to trying to pick funds that will beat the market, you will try to pick times to be in the market (namely, when you think it's going to go up.) And, if you're like most people, you will not be able to pick good times consistently. (On the contrary...) As a result, you will pull money out of the market when you should be putting it in, and put money in when you should be pulling it out. And this will further bludgeon your returns. If you are like most sophisticated rich investors, meanwhile, you will think that, by investing in hedge funds instead of dime-a-dozen mutual funds, you will have a much better chance of beating the market. Instead, your chances will actually be much worse. Why? Because it turns out that the thing that causes the majority of funds to lag the market (mutual funds and hedge funds) is not poor stock-picking ability but fees. On a gross basis, before subtracting costs and fees, about half of funds beat the market every year and half of funds lag it. (This is because funds basically are the market). Once you subtract costs and fees from both groups, however, the odds get much worse. And hedge funds generally charge much higher fees than mutual funds. So, stock-picking, fund-picking, and market-timing are generally terrible ideas. And now for the good news... If, instead of trying to pick a fund that will beat the market, and pick times to be in the market, you just buy and hold a low-cost index fund, you will be guaranteed to beat 90% of funds over the long haul. This is because, unlike actively managed funds, index funds have very low costs and fees. So they track the market, while, on average, the group of actively managed funds loses ground to costs and fees. In contrast to your odds of picking a fund that will beat the market, having a 100% chance of beating the vast majority of actively managed funds are excellent odds. Here's the problem, though: In my experience, it takes a lot of time to persuade even a smart person that it is much smarter to buy and hold low-cost tax efficient index funds than it is to try to beat the market or time the market. After I left Wall Street in 2001, for example (I used to be a stock analyst), it took me about three years of reading Jack Bogle and the academic research and looking at historical performance to persuade myself of this. Eventually, however, the evidence became undeniable and overwhelming. And then I finally stopped trying to pick stocks and (for the most part) time the market and moved my own portfolio into index funds.Â  This is by far the best investment decision I have ever made.Â  Gerard Minack has done Morgan Stanley clients an incredible service by beginning to explain this reality to them as he leaves. Hopefully, Morgan Stanley's financial advisors will now pick up Minack's torch and place their clients in low-cost tax-efficient index funds. (And, if they don't, I would urge Morgan Stanley clients to ask some hard questions of their Morgan Stanley financial advisors. It is not a theory that investing in low-cost index funds is a smarter strategy than trying to pick funds or stocks and trying to time the market. It is a demonstrable fact. With very few exceptions, anyone who tells you otherwise either doesn't know what they are talking about or is selling something. If you want to read more on this, IÂ actually wrote a book about it here.) Here are some charts that Minack published today that should start to persuade you of this: Gerard Minack, Morgan Stanley Gerard Minack Â  Gerard Minack, Morgan Stanley Â  Gerard Minack, Morgan Stanley Â  Gerard Minack, Morgan Stanley Â  Now, if you're like I was ten years ago, you simply won't accept this. You will think that you can pick the few funds that will beat the market and that you can time the market, even if other investors can't. This belief of yours (or your advisor's) will, in all likelihood, be very expensive for you, and it won't likely be true. But, if you're like me, you'll probably have to learn that the hard way. So, if nothing else, please just consider the possibility that these charts might be right, that you might not be one of the handful of investors who can pick great funds and time the market consistently, and that index funds might actually be a smart way to go. Because the sooner you get started in the learning process necessary to persuade yourself of this, the better your returns will be.

She's been there since January, the report said. Â  "It's good to be back," she tells Bloomberg News. Â  In 2011, she was sentenced to 30 months in prison.Â  She got out early on good behavior. Â 
Martin Deutsch via FlickrYesterday, we explained why it is virtually impossible to take out a mortgage, or any other debt, in another currency — as Mark Cuban has done. Mark Cuban has refinanced all of his debt into Japanese yen, hoping that if the yen falls, then paying his debt off gets even cheaper. Part of the issue with why the average person can't get a yen mortgage for their house comes down to banks' unwillingness to expose their retail clients to excessive foreign currency risk (as well as a new Dodd-Frank financial market reform rule).  That being said, if you're really commit ed to having yen debt, then replicating the Cuban trade is possible. Bond trader Ed Bradford, better known as @fullcarry on twitter, explained to us how to mimic the effect of a yen mortgage by trading. Here's how you'd do it: When you have a 30 year mortgage, your are essentially short a bond.  It is hard to know the exact maturity of the bond because at the outset you don't necessarily know when you will sell the house. In the US though we model mortgages as though they have a maturity between 5 and 7 years which seems to be the average holding period when people buy a new home. So the 10 year UST future (which actually is tied to a bond that has 7 years to maturity) isn't a perfect match for our mortgage but does tend to track it.  By buying the 10 year U.S. treasury future and selling the 10 year Japanese government bond futures ( done in correct proportions), we can get our mortgage to track Japanese interest rates.   And of course, we need to short the Yen vs USD for the correct currency exposure. As someone on twitter pointed out, it would be much easier to do this with currency forwards.  Those allow for the currency exposure to be aligned with the term of the loan directly so you only need that one forward instrument which has interest rate differentials already built in. Currency forwards though require a willing counter party. Of course, all of this is rather complicated and I wouldn't recommend it for retail accounts, especially since futures need to be rolled over every quarter and relative sizes need to be adjusted.   I just wanted to point out the mechanism.  As another source pointed out to us, this still leaves you exposed to the foreign currency risk retail banks are now trying to shield mainstream clients from — or as he put it, "the Hungary blow up approach."

There are two other possibilities: one is paperwork, and the other is nostalgia. -Frank Zappa I want you to stop, take a breath and consider this moment we're in. Because you will look back on it and realize how amazing it was - how amazing it is! The Black Swans we'd been guessing at have had their necks broken one by one, their heads bashed in. Blood and feathers, a smear on the wall. We have a stock market that goes up on good news, bad news, no news and a lot of news. Blue chip companies are posting gains that would make late-90's tech stocks blush. They miss earnings occasionally, drop in price temporarily and find themselves higher than ever within a week. Listen to what we now argue about - which sector will outperform which other sector! What?!?!? The S&amp;P 500 is up 17% in the first five months of the year and we're preoccupied with whether healthcare or tech will make a new high first! Who gives a fuck! Quite a sea change from our concerns of last year and the year before. It's a farce but a it's fun one. And there are giants among us! Right now! Tepper and Musk on the road toward earning their legendary status, Buffett and Icahn basking in the glow of accomplishments past and present. The market trembles in anticipation of their next pronouncement, it shakes as they stride by. We will tell our grandchildren that we breathed the same air, perhaps even served as unwitting counterparties to their trades. We have a housing situation in which there isn't enough supply. Over one million new homes will be built this year. There is a change in psychology that's taken hold, like someone flicked a light switch on January 1st - no, like someone fired a starting gun! Please don't take my word for it, talk to a realtor. The household formation engine is revving up again as the kids get jobs and need a place of their own to have sex and babies. There are all-cash bids. There are bidding wars. The foreclosures are being taken off the banks' hands, fixed up and rented out. Google has just invented virtual reality in a pair of eyeglasses. If you watched Star Trek growing up and longed for your very own holodeck, well, it's here. You shall have it. The economy is rebuilding itself atop the ashes of the old one. Traditions are being trashed as we make new ones, vestigial institutions  - the US Postal Service, terrestrial radio, the 9-to-5 cubicle career - are being gutted, their idiosyncrasies as endearing as they are irrelevant. New industries are sprouting up. There is a natural gas renaissance, there is a manufacturing renaissance - Middle America is an Emerging Market. There is an oil boom - in America! We are minting millionaires in Utah and South Dakota and Montana at an amazing rate. There is a healthcare revolution. In their final act of vanity and vainglorious selfishness, the Boomers shall now attempt to live forever. They will replace every part of themselves and seek to rejuvenate the rest. They will spend incomprehensible sums on this and fortunes will be made. There is a alternative energy second act. Berkshire Hathaway is building the largest solar project on earth. Electric cars are coming - for real this time. Everyone is coding. Everyone is mobile. We walk around with computers in our pocket more powerful than the NASA equipment that first put men into orbit. The curtain has been pulled back and the alarmists have been revealed for what they are: old men in suits. They are terrified. Their world is going away and no one will listen. They are lashing out, gasping for moment's worth of attention from someone, anyone - even if they must use scare tactics to get it. It's not working. People are going about their lives. They are making long-term plans again. The Boomers are still working. They are aware of the research about their aging brains - "use it or lose it" say the scientists. They need not retire, we don't want their jobs, we are creating our own. The workforce is adjusting. The very definition of work itself is up for grabs. We are redefining it now. We've ventured out of the trenches and have not had our heads blown off. We've taken a few steps forward and it feels good. So we take a few more. Still alive. It may never be this good again.

The Powerball Jackpot has hit a whopping $600 million, and it's only a matter of time before lottery fever hits America again.  We talked about the various statistics a lottery player needs to familiarize themselves with, but there's one in particular that players really care about. People don't really expect to win the jackpot, but it's certainly nice to win something from the endeavor.  The best way to improve your odds of victory are to buy more tickets. An while there's no way to be 100% certain you'll win on at least one of them, there are way to make sure you've got an estimable chance.  Besides the jackpot, there are a number of other, vastly more likely prizes, from $4 to $1,000,000. The odds a ticket wins any prize are around 1 in 32.  Keep in mind, this analysis is if you assumed the quick draw random selection. If you want to guarantee one win, you could just buy 35 tickets, each with a unique Powerball. That would guarantee you win $4 minimum.  However, we want to know how it looks with a random selection.  The probability a single ticket isn't any kind of prizewinner is 96.88%.  The formula to calculate the probability that you don't win any prizes given a certain number of tickets is: P(No winners) = (Probability of not winning)[Number of tickets bought] or P(No winners) = (0.9688)[Number of tickets bought] So, the probability you do have at least one prize-winning ticket is: P(Winners) = 1 - (0.9688)[Number of tickets bought] Since we're trying to figure out how many tickets to buy, let's plot this out: Walter Hickey / BI Keep in mind, you're probably going to lose a bunch of money buying all these Powerball tickets. However, if you want to find out how many you need to buy nonetheless, here's what you need.  So, depending on how many tickets you buy, you have different levels of confidence that you have at least one winner: Walter Hickey / BI Again, this is a really risky investment strategy with low potential payoff.  So good luck, and remember, fortune favors the bold.

APRep. Mike Kelly (R-Pa.) went on a rant during outgoing Acting IRS Commissioner Steven Miller's testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee on Friday, earning himself a standing ovation at its conclusion. After an intense line of questioning, Kelly used up the balance of his speaking time by laying into Miller with a nearly three-minute long rant. "I have to tell you â€” where you're sitting, you should be outraged. But you're not," Kelly said to Miller, who resigned on Wednesday at the request of the White House.Â  "The American people should be outraged, and they are. ... This reaffirms everything the American public believes. This is a huge blow to the faith and trust the American people have in their government. Is there any limit to the scope of where you folks can go?" Here's video: 
Governors from California, Iowa, Virginia, Wisconsin, South Dakota, and Guam have already visited the country on trade missions in 2013, and more than a dozen states currently have offices in China to promote trade and investment.Â California Gov. Jerry Brown recently reopened the stateâ€™s trade office in Shanghai, which was closed in 2003 because of budget cuts,Â according to BloombergÂ . In 2012, the United States exported $108.6 billion worth of goods to China, making it the third-largest US export market, according toÂ a recent report by the US-China Business CouncilÂ .Â (USCBC is the publisher of theÂ China Business Review.) China ranked as one of the top three export markets for 34 states, and 30 states exported more than $1 billion worth of goods to China.Â  And since 2009â€”when US exports to China dipped slightly because of the global economic slowdownâ€”12 states have doubled their exports to China. The top 10 states exported $59.9 billion worth of goods to China in 2012, accounting for more than half of all US exports to China.Â Here is a summary of the states that exported the most goods to China in 2012.

This is a huge jump, and what it means is that a lot of people will start to play the lottery.Â  Before diving in to play, there are three statistical facts you need to know to figure out if it's how you want to spend your money.Â  Here are the probabilities for winning Powerball, according to their official site: Powerball Let's see what we can figure out from this.Â  So the first thing we want to calculate is the expected value. Let's say you have four dollar bills of different denominations in a bag. You can't see them, but I tell you that one is a twenty, two are singles, and one is a five. I'm charging you six bucks to reach in and grab a bank note. Should you play? Well, the probability of drawing any of the four bills is 0.25. There are two singles, so the probability of drawing a single is 0.5. If we multiply the probability and payout of each event, and sum that for all events, we get the expected value of playing the game.Â  Here's the expected value for the money game. Keep in mind I'm charging you $6 to play: EV = ($20â€”$6)*(0.25) + ($5â€”$6)*(0.25) + ($1â€”$6)*(0.5) EV = ($14*0.25) + (-$1*0.25) + (-$5*0.5) =Â $0.75 So, on average, you'll make seventy five cents by playing the game. So you should, theoretically, play.Â  Let's check that out with the current Powerball game, plugging in the jackpot and using the probabilities given.Â  Walter Hickey / BI So the expected value of playing the game is winning $1.78. That's not bad, but it's pretty important to know that almost all of that is derived from the ludicrously inflated and highly improbable jackpot.Â  Keep in mind, this doesn't account for the possibility of multiple winners splitting the jackpot, which should be a crucial part of any serious return on investment analysis. Last time the Powerball was this high, we figured out the probability of a player winning the game on any number of draws.Â  Given the astronomical 1 in 175 million odds, it's pretty unlikely that you'll be the winner. But for there to be one â€” or multiple â€” winners, it's not that uncommon.Â  The probability that there is not a single Jackpot lottery winner in a drawing is defined by this formula: Probability of no winner Â = (1 - Jackpot probability)Number of Tickets Which means that the probability of one or more winners is: Probability of winner(s) Â = 1 - [(1 - Jackpot probability)Number of Tickets] Since we don't know the eventual number of tickets, here's a chart that shows the different probabilities for different values: Walter Hickey / BI There are even odds of a winner at the point when around 120 million tickets are sold.Â  So this doesn't prove you'll make a profit, but if you crave the sensation of success and want to guarantee it, here's how many tickets you should buy to guarantee â€” with certain degrees of confidence â€” that you'll have at least one winning ticket for some prize.Â  This is similar to the last problem, only the calculation looks like this: P(At least 1 winning ticket) = 1 - [(Probability of not winning a prize)Number of Tickets] From the Expected Value problem, recall there is a 96.9% chance you have a losing ticket.Â  Here are the probabilities of at least one winner for any number of bought tickets: Walter Hickey / BI So, some notes: Keep in mind, this analysis is if you assumed the quick draw random selection. If you want to guarantee one win, you could just buy 35 tickets, each with a unique Powerball. That would guarantee you win $4 minimum.Â  However, we want to know how it looks with a random selection.Â 
APKarima El Mahroug Silvio Berlusconi's legal woes continue, as a key witness in a sex-for-money trial against him told a court that dancers dressed as nuns and President Barack Obama at the former Italian premier's notorious "bunga bunga" party. Karima El Mahroug, better known as "Ruby the heartstealer", had appeared in a Milan court today as a witness in the trial against talent scout Lele Mora, television anchor Emilio Fede and former showgirl and regional councilor Nicole Minetti, Reuters reports, all of whom are accused of organizing prostitutes for Berlusconi's "bunga bunga" parties. It was the first time Mahroug has testified in court. While Mahroug, now 21-years-old, wasn't testifying against Berlusconi, and she repeated her denial of ever sleeping with Berlusconi, other comments in the court today were damning. YouTubeMarysthell PolancoThe Morroco-born dancer confirmed previous rumors that Berlusconi's "bunga bunga" parties had featured girls dressed up as nuns, and that Dominican-native showgirl Marysthell Polanco dressed up "as Obama" at one party. Mahroug also said she saw 20 girls stripping for Berlusconi, then still the Prime Minister of Italy. This flies in the face of how Berlusconi describes his "bunga bunga" parties — he has specifically denied the accusation that girls dressed up as nuns, and prefers to portray the parties as elegant soirees. Mahroug is already a big problem for Berlusconi. The former Italian Prime Minister is accused of paying for sex with the dancer when she was just 17-years-old. Paying for sex with anyone under 18 is illegal in Italy (prostitution itself is not), and Mahroug is the center of a separate trial against Berlusconi. The underage prostitution trial is just one of Berlusconi's current legal problems — an appeals court recently upheld tax fraud conviction against him and sentenced him to four years in prison.
 Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has just sent the following letter to John Boehner and other leaders on the debt ceiling. The whole thing is below the dotted line. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Honorable John A. BoehnerSpeakerU.S. House of RepresentativesWasrungton, DC 20515Dear Mr. Speaker:WASHINGTON, D.C.May 17, 2013As provided by Public Law 113-3, the statutory debt limit was suspended by Congress throughMay 18, 2013. Because Congress has not yet acted to approve normal borrowing authority after May 18, the Treasury Department will begin implementing the standard set of extraordinary measures that enable us, on a temporary basis, to protect the full faith and credit of the United States by continuing to pay the nation'S bills. These measures are the same ones that have been used in previous debt limit impasses, and are described in detail in an appendix to this letter. The effective duration of the extraorctinary measures is subject to considerable uncertainty due to a variety of factors, including the unpredictability of tax receipts, changes in expenditure flows under the sequester, and the normal challenges of forecasting the payments and receipts of the U.S. government months into the future. An additional source of uncertainty has been the amount and timing of certain payments to the Treasury by Fannie Mae and Fredctie Mac in light of their improving financial conditions. In the case of Fannie Mae, we learned last week that Treasury will receive a payment of approximately $60 billion on June 28, 2013. Given the uncertainty described above, at this time, Treasury is not able to provide a specific estimate of how long the extraordinary measures will last. However, in view of the forthcoming Fannie Mae payment and the trend in other payment flows, it is now clear that the measures will not be exhausted until after Labor Day. Nevertheless, Congress should act sooner rather than later to protect America's good credit and avoid the potentially catastrophic consequences offailing to act until it is too late.It is important to note that increasing the debt limit does not increase spencting or authorize new spending; rather, it simply permits the United States to continue to honor pre-existingcommitments to our citizens, businesses, and investors here and around the world. Thesecommitments were already approved by Congress, and honoring them is not optional. Theglobal economic leadership position enjoyed by the United States rests on the confidence ofAmericans and people around the world that we are a nation that keeps its promises and pays all of its bills, in full and on time. Breaching that trust would do irreparable harm to the economy and the American public. In this context, I want to reiterate the Administration's view, expressed in a Statement ofAdministration Position on May 7,2013, regarding the so-called prioritization bill passed by theHouse of Representatives last week. This legislation is unwise, unworkable, unacceptably risky, and would hann the fun faith and credit of the nation. The President has indicated he would veto the legislation if it were to reach his desk.Protecting the full faith and credit of the United States is the responsibility of Congress because only Congress can extend the nation's borrowing authority. No Congress in our history has failed to meet that responsibility. It must be understood that the creditworthiness of the United States is an essential underpinning of our strength as a nation; it is not a bargaining chip to be used for partisan political ends. I want to reemphasize what the President has said repeatedly regarding any threats to cause default in order to extract policy concessions from the Administration: We will not negotiate over the debt limit. The creditworthiness of the UnitedStates is non-negotiable. The question of whether the country must pay obligations it has already incurred is not open to debate. Congress has no choice but to protect our creditworthiness andour economy. The President has proposed detailed plans for reducing our fiscal deficits, and he stands ready to continue working with Congress toward this objective. However, those negotiations are separate from any debate over the debt limit. Therefore, I respectful1y urge Congress to meet its responsibility to the nation by extending normal borrowing authority well before any risk of default becomes imminent. In order to avoid a repeat of the damaging brinksmanship that occurred in 2011, Congress should remove the threat of default by taking this action as soon as possible.Sincerely Jack Lew

Everyone has to eat, even if they're working insane hours. Wall Streeter's (on top of having to eat) must also entertain clients. So they need to know something about decent food in NYC. Here at Business Insider, we like to keep tabs on where people are actually taking their expense accounts, or business associates, or girlfriends â€” whatever. So we asked our sources to give us a long list of restaurants that Wall Streeters go to, then we turned that list into a poll where readers rated each venue "Not Wall Street," "Sorta Wall Street," or "Totally Wall Street." Scientific, you see. Surprise, surprise, there are a ton of steakhouses on this list â€” but they aren't the only spots. Sushi and New American food make a showing, and most surprisingly, the winning restaurant isn't somewhere were you HAVE to make it rain to fill your stomach (you can if you want, though).
AP Photo/The Canadian Press, Nathan DenetteToronto Mayor Rob Ford is at the center of another controversy after Gawker and The Toronto Star reported on aÂ video of Ford allegedlyÂ smoking crack out of a glass pipe. Ford's lawyer,Â Dennis Morris, told a Canadian radio station that he doesn't know "whether or not such a video exists" but that "it would be fair for the public to see such a video and make their own conclusions."Â  Morris also said that Ford denies the allegations. This is far from the first time Ford has been caught up in controversy. In March, The Toronto Star reported that Ford was asked to leave a military gala because organizers were concerned that he was intoxicated. One member of the organizing committee told the newspaper that Ford "seemed either drunk, high or had a medical condition." People who attended the event said he was "nervous, excited, sweaty, out of it." The Star also claimed that some of Ford's staff members have repeatedly tried to persuade the mayor to get help for an alcohol problem. Ford responded by calling The Star "pathological liars." Earlier that month, one of Ford's former mayoral opponents accused him of grabbing her ass and hitting on her at an event for young Jewish professionals.Â Ford denied the allegations. In November, Ford was nearly forced out of officeÂ for violating conflict of interest rules. Using city letterhead, he solicited donations from lobbyists for his football charity. The court granted Ford's appeal of their decision to remove him from office. Earlier in 2012, he said that he wanted to ban anyone convicted of a gun crime from Toronto. He said on a radio show: "Once theyâ€™re charged and they go to jail the most important thing is when they get out of jail, I donâ€™t want them living in this city. They can go anywhere else, but I donâ€™t want them in the city.....whatever I can do to get them out of the city Iâ€™m going to, regardless of whether they have family or friends." He also made headlines when he was caught on camera eating KFC during a citywide weightloss campaign. In 2011, Keith Olbermann called Ford the "worst person in the world"Â after Ford called 911 when a well-known actress posing as a reporter showed up at his house to do a mock interview with him for a satirical TV show. Ford was reportedly swearing at the 911 operators. Also in 2011, reports of domestic disputes involving Ford and his wife surfaced. Police responded to a "verbal altercation" at his home in October and his wife's mother called police on Christmas morning after Ford took the couple's children to the airport, saying he was going to Florida. He was also charged in Florida once for drunk driving and possession of marijuana. The alleged video of Ford smoking crack has not yet surfaced online. Reporters for Gawker and The Star say they've seen it, but the people in possession of the video are asking for a six-figure sum of money to purchase it. There's already a crowdsourcing effort on Indiegogo for anyone who wants to contribute to buying the video.

With stocks at all-time highs, investors can't help but consider what happened that last two times we saw peaks. Sure, the highs of 2000 and 2007 were followed by crashes. But while the nominal prices may be similar, the fundamentals are very different. "Anyone can find similarities in the stock market action of different years," writes Reformed Broker Josh Brown. "It's not complicated - stocks can really only do some combination of three things, up, down or sideways. "But this type of comparative analysis is, as always, a function of what details you choose to leave out. I can compare my house to the Taj Mahal if I choose to leave outÂ  quantitativeÂ  factors like square footage or qualitative factors like its location or historicalÂ significance." One key difference Brown points to is valuation as measured by the ratio of price to earnings (P/E). "Here's a very rudimentary but essential thing to be aware of - in 1999 the S&amp;P finished at 1469, earned 53 bucks per share, and paid out $16 in dividends," writes Brown. "These are nominal figures, notÂ adjusted for inflation. The 2013 S&amp;P 500 is earning double that amount - over $100 per share.Â The index will also be paying out double the dividend this year, more than $30 per share, and returning even more cash with record-setting share repurchases." Oppenheimer's John Stoltzfus provided this handy chart this week overlaying the S&amp;P 500 with it's P/E ratio.Â  It also addresses inflation. You come away with three conclusions: 1) the valuation (P/E) is much more reasonable today than during the last two highs, 2) nominal and adjusted earnings are much higher today, and 3) the inflation-adjusted price of the stock market is around 20% lower today than in 2000. So while the nominal price might seem scary, everything else about the stock market today is much more reasonable. Oppenheimer

Members of Congress grilled former IRS Acting Commissioner Steven Miller on Capitol Hill Friday morning, in an attempt to get answers on the IRS' inappropriate targeting of conservative-sounding groups that were applying for tax-exempt status.  Republicans and Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee both said that Miller and other IRS officials should have alerted Congress in testimony last year that they knew the agency was giving extra scrutiny to conservative and Tea Party groups.  Toward the end of nearly two hours of testimony in the morning, Miller became frustrated when Rep. David Reichert (R-Wash.) demanded "yes or no" answers and questioned why Miller seemed to be unaware of many specifics during the hearing. "You're not going to cooperate with me here, Mr. Miller. You've been uncooperative throughout this hearing," Reichert said, which made Miller appear to roll his eyes. Another Republican Congressman, Kevin Brady (R-Texas), confronted Miller after reading a letter from the head of a group who said she was targeted by the IRS. Brady accused Miller, the IRS, and the broader federal government of being "drunk on power." "Is this still America?" Brady asked. For his part, Miller pushed back on the word "targeting" as a description of IRS activities, saying it was a "loaded" word that he thought didn't accurately describe what the IRS was doing. Here's some video of the last exchange, via Mediaite: 
Earlier today, Morgan Stanley's Head of Global Developed Markets Gerard Minack announced his retirement. Most people have never heard of this Australia-based strategist.  However, his concise two-page notes regularly provided the sharpest insights on the state of the markets.  The savviest investors followed his work closely.  And we often featured his wild charts on Business Insider. Here are a few highlights from Minack's recent work that show why he was the most underrated strategist on Wall Street: 1) The time he showed why Wall Street analysts are horrible: "As they say, forecasting is difficult – particularly the future. Consensus earnings forecasts show just how difficult: Exhibit 1 illustrates consensus EPS forecasts for the S&amp;P 500 from 1985, with the initial forecast for each year indexed to 100." Morgan Stanley 2) The time he explained the connection between inequality and political disfunction: "Politics has become a more intrusive factor for investors. The prospect of heightened political uncertainty is one reason to think risk asset valuations will be structurally lower compared to the past 30 years... Rising inequality has gone hand-in-hand with rising political polarization. Exhibit 4 shows income inequality in the US (Gini coefficient) and a measure of polarization in the US Congress." Morgan Stanley 3) When he explained why American corporations are the envy of the world: Minack has argued that the recent rally in U.S. stocks has been largely attributable to companies with domestic exposure.  This isn't completely obvious when considering S&amp;P 500 earnings because nearly half of the business generated by the S&amp;P 500 companies comes from abroad.  Minack offered this chart separating forecasts for foreign-focused earnings from domestic-focused earnings. "Poor performance of foreign-focused earnings fits the long-standing (and unsurprising) link between growth in America’s trading partners and foreign-sourced profits," says Minack. Jordan Tanner, Morgan Stanley Research 4) When he busted the myth of the Great Rotation: Minack was one of the earliest skeptics to dismantle the "great rotation" thesis that was circulating at the beginning of the year.  This was the idea that all of the money that flowed from stocks to bonds would reverse, sending flows from bonds to stocks. "First," Minack wrote, "the idea of a ‘great rotation’ from debt into equity presupposes that there has been a massive rotation from equity to debt. It's not clear that that has happened." The chart below shows flows into and out of money market, bond, and equity funds since 2007. While it's true that money has flowed out of equity funds and into bond funds over that period, it's clear that there is more to the story. ICI, Morgan Stanley Research 5) When he took on Bill Gross, and won: While it is true that GDP growth should associate with strong earnings growth generally for companies in those economies, it's not true that strong earnings growth necessarily associates with strong Earnings Per Share growth. This was an important insight, that rejected an argument made by Bill Gross, who had claimed that stocks couldn't outperform growth. In places where earnings are growing fast, companies are raising a lot of capital by issuing shares, and therefore actual earnings per share fail to keep up, preventing investors from enjoying those gains. This chart brilliantly shows that in countries with high earnings growth, high share dilution is likely to follow, thus undercutting the return for any given investor. Morgan Stanley 6) When he poured cold water on the manufacturing renaiisance: "Most see the prospect of America reindustrialising as bullish. In my view, that depends on whether you are an economist or whether you are an investor. The ‘deindustrialisation’ of America was bad for economic growth, but the increased global supply of labour lifted margins and total profits. The effect of wider margins on profits far outweighed the effect of two weak US GDP cycles (the cycles following the 2001 and 2008-09 recessions). Reindustrialisation may reverse this mix: Economic growth may improve, but margins worsen." Gerard Minack, Morgan Stanley
Getty Images Entertainment/ Stephen Lovekin/StaffHedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman is leading a group of other real estate investors to buy a $90 million penthouse duplex at One57, the Wall Street Journal reports.   One57 is a super luxurious residential skyscraper overlooking Central Park that is currently under construction. You might remember it from super storm Sandy as the building with the hanging crane. The deal for the apartment, which occupies the 75th and 76th floors, is still in contract, the report said.   An unnamed source told the Journal that Ackman, who runs $12 billion Pershing Square Capital Management, does not have plans to move into the apartment.  Instead, the apartment is being used as an investment, according to the source.   If he did move in, though, it would be perfect because it's just steps away from his hedge fund's office at 888 Seventh Avenue.   Here's a rendering of what One57 looks like:  Extell Development CompanyA rendering of One57

Tom Pennington/Getty ImagesThe University of Michigan's consumer confidence survey is out. The headline index rose to 83.7 from 76.4 last month. That's the highest reading since July 2007. Economists were looking for a smaller rise to 77.9. The economic conditions sub-component advanced to 97.5 from 89.9 last month, while the economic outlook sub-component rose to 74.8 from 67.8. Inflation expectations one year ahead were unchanged from last month at 3.1%, while inflation expectations five years ahead edged down to 2.8% from 2.9% last month.
REUTERS/David W CernyPhiladelphia Fed President Charles PlosserBofA economist Ethan Harris has been adamant in recent months about the slowdown in inflation and what it means for Federal Reserve monetary policy. Harris believes it skews the risks of more monetary stimulus to the upside â€“ after all, despite criticism of the Fed's quantitative easing program and its effect on bond markets, the central bank is still undershooting its nominal targets on both the inflation and employment fronts. In other words, as long as the annual inflation rate stays below the central bank's 2% target, it puts more pressure on the Federal Reserve to continue buying up Treasury and mortgage bonds Over the past two weeks, speeches from various regional Fed presidents who tend to take a hawkish policy stance â€“ and articles from Wall Street Journal Federal Reserve reporter, Jon Hilsenrath, who is known for his access at the Fed â€“ have shifted the conversation toward the possibility that the central bank will begin tapering down its stimulus soon. Against this backdrop, there's been a significant back-up in interest rates in recent weeks as the bond market contemplates what sort of effect reduced buying from the Fed would have. Harris asserts in a note to clients that "comments by FOMC hawks still get undue attention in the markets and the financial press," specifically calling out Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser: The wrong man:Â Bond markets have been on edge since the start of the year, trying to figure out when the Fed might scale back its QE3 purchases. Despite their limited role in the policy making process, comments by hawkish FOMC members still appear to get undue weight by the markets. Good recent examples were comments by Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser, both for a Wall Street Journal article and in speeches in Europe. Plosserâ€™s calls to start tapering QE3 in June are likely to fall on deaf ears, in our view, as his reasons for wanting to scale back the Fedâ€™s asset purchases are not generally shared by his Fed colleagues. Plosser is not a voting member on the FOMC this year. Dovish Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren, on the other hand, is a voting member, "and he has been a much better barometer of Fed policy actions than Plosser," says Harris: Plosser dismissed the recent data, noting inflation has been close to 2% over the past three years. â€œShould inflation expectation begin to fall,â€ he said, â€œwe might need to take action to defend our inflation goal.â€ Rosengren took the opposite tack: â€œthe longer we in the US remain so far below our 2 percent target, the greater the risk that inflation expectations could fall.â€ As we discuss in our Macro Viewpoint this week, this seems to be the greater risk. And it is increasingly likely to preoccupy the majority of Fed officials until inflation rates rebound.Â  (Hilsenrath disagrees with this argument. He wrote in a WSJ blog post yesterday that the FOMC isn't "ringing the alarm bells" over inflation yet because of quirks in the way the inflation indices are computed.) That all makes sense, even though bond markets seem to be taking threats of Fed tapering pretty seriously in recent trading sessions. But Harris goes on to completely eviscerate the hawkish argument for Fed tapering: First, it seems inconsistent to be confident that inflation will rise back to 2% due to anchored expectations, yet see a high risk that inflation expectations will become unanchored to the upside. Why is the public supposed to have full faith that the Fed can increase inflation but not that it can reduce inflation? Are inflation expectations anchored to â€œtwo percent or higherâ€?  Second, the anchored expectations argument is too parsimonious to explain recent movements in inflation. If inflation expectations are really that powerful, why did inflation cycle up and down over the last two years? In our view, a sensible forecast should acknowledge that global commodity and labor costs boosted inflation in 2011 and have been reducing inflation ever since. We also think continued economic slackâ€”a 7.5% unemployment rate, and weak global growthâ€”should push down inflation. Third, and more fundamental, the hawks seem to assume that the general public forms inflation expectations the same way they do. People allegedly see that bank reserves are unusually high, pull out their undergraduate money and banking textbook, and conclude that the reserves will inevitably cause a multiple expansion of lending and spending. In the jargon of economics, this is an example of a â€œrational expectationsâ€ model, in which the economic actors form expectations about the future using the same model as the economist... This leads to our fourth argument: inflation expectations could fall as well as rise. Indeed, economists at the Cleveland Fed argue that if inflation breakevens are properly adjusted, inflation expectations have already fallen below target.3 Keep in mind that the gap between nominal and real treasury yields is, at best, a very rough gauge of inflation expectations. The gap is impacted by the relative liquidity of the two markets as well as a variety of uncertainty or risk premiums. For example, during the financial crisis, inflation breakevens collapsed in part due to lower inflation expectations, but mainly because investors piled into the safe, highly liquid nominal treasury market, causing a huge liquidity premium. That's why Harris isn't listening to the hawks. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and New York Fed President Bill Dudley, on the other hand (considered to be two of the three most important voices on the FOMC, along with Vice Chairman Janet Yellen) are hitting the tape early next week. "We see two things to watch for," says Harris: "hints of concern that inflation is too low and confirmation that the Fed has the flexibility to increase as well as reduce the pace of QE."
Risk management firm and insurance brokerÂ Aon has just released its Terrorism And Political Violence risk map for 2013. The news is that apparently, the U.S. is in no danger of the latter kind of disturbance. Instead, the only risk to America is terrorism. Meanwhile in Europe, the overall risk levels in France and Spain are actually equivalent to China and Russia, presumably on the basis of the former countries' recent, heated demonstrations protesting austerity. And the sleepiest countries in the world? Denmark, Finland, Japan, Australia, Iceland, Uruguay and Botswana â€” the risk of anything happening there is negligible. Check it out: Aon And here is their list of countries with notable changes in their risk ratings: Aon
REUTERS/Bobby YipGold prices have fallen over 12.5% since April 1. They are now below the crucial $1,400 level. This is bad news for central banks that have been diversifying their foreign reserves to include gold. Yet central banks continue to be net purchasers of gold. Global central banks bought 109 tonnes of gold in Q1. And their gold holdings increased to 31,735.4 as of May, according to the latest report from the World Gold Council. We drew on the report to highlight the countries sitting on the biggest official gold reserves. Note: CBGA refers to the Central Bank Gold Agreements.Â The first Agreement (CBGA 1) ran from September 27, 1999 to September 26, 2004. The second (CBGA 2) ran from September 27, 2004 to September 26, 2009. The third (CBGA 3) will run for five years from September 2009.
Bloomberg TVGold has been getting crushed. It's almost back to its April lows. Japanese Government Bonds (JGB) have also been getting slammed lately, although yields are still incredibly low. We've been talking about why the gold decline is good news (it means an end to fear, and an increase in desire to put money into real assets). But some have worried about the decline in Japanese Government Bonds (and the increase in yields) given Japan's famously high debt. David Zervos of Jefferies says not to worry about it. It's all part of the same awesome news. Many in the doom and gloom crowd have warned of impending disaster as JGB prices plummet. The typical story centers upon unsustainable debt levels and higher debt service costs associated with higher rates. The story line generally involves a vicious payment spiral which destroys public finances and spins the country into Armageddon/default - essentially Japan becomes Greece.  Of course, the failure in this line of reasoning is simple. Any country that prints the fiat which backs its debt issuance can never default - unless they actually choose not to print. Could the BoJ "choose" to stand idly by and not print Yen as government financing costs spike? Sure they could - and they could also decide to start singing karaoke during Board meetings. They "could" do anything, but they won't halt the printing presses during a public finance crisis. Right now the BoJ is barely holding on to its independence, do you think they will be able to hold off on printing as a serious crisis develops? No Chance. So all the signs continue to be good.

This is a continuation of a theme started earlier, in this post On Entrepreneurship, Part I Founding an investment firm A friend from college once explained to me that, growing up, he didnâ€™t realize his family was wealthy.Â  His dad worked at an investment firm, and they had a comfortable lifestyle, but my friend noted no major extravagances about their life. One day his father told him that he had in fact founded the investment company where he worked, and that while the salary heâ€™d drawn for the past thirty years had made them comfortable, their familyâ€™s real net worth, as he approached retirement, was something much more significant. The key, his dad explained, was that unlike other dads who worked for a salary and then retired after a few decades, he had, by contrast, built up something very valuable at the end â€“ his equity in the firm he founded.Â  He sold the majority of his investment business to a European bank for a considerable sum, which overwhelmed the regular salary heâ€™d drawn over the years.Â  Being an owner made all the difference. Suddenly my friend realized his family was more than just comfortable, it was inter-generationally wealthy. The Goldman IPO In my own life, I joined Goldman Sachs shortly before the firm went public via an IPO.Â  This event made hardly any difference to my career or net worth.Â  As an analyst with very little service to the firm at the time, I hardly rated any notable equity gift. For people with longer service at the firm, however the lesson of the IPO â€“ in particular the difference between fixed income and equity â€“ couldnâ€™t have been any starker.Â  Managing Directors, the penultimate â€˜rankâ€™ at the firm, could expect a low seven-figure payout through the IPO award of stock and stock options.Â  That was nice, and Iâ€™d be the last one to ever feel bad for a Managing Director at Goldman.Â  Partners, the highest rank at Goldman, owned the firm before the IPO.Â  I estimate Partners generally received a payout 30 times higher than Managing Directors at the IPO.Â  Amazing to me. The Managing Director IPO amount was cool and comfortable, but probably didnâ€™t change everything about the personâ€™s life.Â  The 30-times-higher partner payout, represented blow-your-doors-off-never-work-again type money.Â  All because the partners owned equity, and the MDâ€™s didnâ€™t. Managing Directors and Partners did the same jobs, worked themselves to the bone the same way, dedicated their every waking breath to advancing the firm, and had distinguished themselves at the top of the financial pyramid.Â  Usually the biggest difference between an MD today and Partner tomorrow was time â€“ the Partners had typically joined the firm a couple of years earlier. Although the Goldman IPO represented the extreme example of salary vs. ownership in my own life, I have come to think that that ratio holds true elsewhere as well. My best guess is that the difference between fixed income and equity, when it comes to getting rewarded financially after a lifetime of building equity, is about 30 times higher. You know those charts showing the difference between fixed income and equity returns over the long run?Â Â  Iâ€™m talking about charts where the returns from fixed income assets show a modest, steady rise due to moderate compounding effects, while the equity chart shows a rocky, but ultimately asymptotic upward turn? Those charts show the difference in investment returns from bonds vs. stocks.Â  And also the returns from working for a salary vs. owning and building a successful business. Iâ€™m not insisting you be profit-oriented.Â  But if you are profit-oriented, you need to figure out a way to own your own business.Â  For the same amount of work, the financial payout is 30 times higher at the end of your career. Caveats, qualifiers, clarifications on the for-profit life vs. other choices Not everyone wants to work for profit, and I think thatâ€™s just fine.Â  Great even.Â  Many people prefer to create beauty in the world, or to contribute to better understanding in human relationships, or to encourage the care and feeding of the soul. Others seek to push the envelope on human knowledge, or to sculpt young minds, or to comfort the grieved or heal the stricken. Others, perhaps a majority of the human race, just want to take in enough money on a weekly basis to allow some leisure time for beer, ice cream, and football. I applaud you if you seek any of these things. All of these goals, in their own way, are as valid, or more valid, than maximizing your pile of money. So when I write about the advantages of entrepreneurship for maximizing personal profits, Iâ€™m addressing the profit-oriented person right now. If you do plan to work on increasing your personal pile of money, you cannot afford to work for a salary, for someone else, on a fixed income.Â  You need to start building equity, like, right now. See previous post on Entrepreneurship Part I â€“ Equity is Ownership, Fixed income is Salary
REUTERS/Issei KatoJapan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (L), standing next to Japan Akademeia head Jiro Ushio, toasts with business leaders and scholars during a banquet hosted by Japan Akademeia in Tokyo May 17, 2013.Japan's new approach to reflating its economy â€“ termed "Abenomics," after Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe â€“ involves three components: unprecedented monetary stimulus, a big boost to government spending, and structural reforms designed to make Japanese industry and institutions more competitive. These are referred to as the "Three Arrows" of Abenomics. The Japanese government has already announced plans for the first two "arrows" on the fiscal and monetary fronts. Structural reforms, on the other hand, had not yet really come to the fore of the discussion until today. Overnight, Abe announced some plans. Reuters has the details: The latest tranche of Japan's growth strategy will aim to triple infrastructure exports and double farm exports by 2020, as well as boost private investment, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Friday. The government will set a target for domestic private-sector investment of 70 trillion yen ($687 billion) annually, Abe said in a speech to business executives and academics, the level before the 2008 financial crisis and up about 10 percent from the current figure. The details, of course, aren't fully fleshed out, but Abe hopes to have a more comprehensive strategy ready for a June 17-18 G8 summit, so we should hear more then. Credit Suisse's Henry Russell expressed skepticism, citing fears of a "shift from structural reform to constitutional reform," writing to clients that "Abe appears more focused on the long term Abe family/LDP goal of constitutional reform, rather than industrial revitalization and social reform." "Whatever you choose to believe with regards to Abe's 'third arrow'," says Russell, "the BoJ's aggressive JGB purchases, reflation, a flood of liquidity and yen weakness should be enough to buoy markets for the next 1-2 years."
You know the old phrase: "Those that can, do. Those that can't, teach." In his final note, Morgan Stanley strategist Gerard Minack applies it to Wall Street: I’ve always said that those that can, do; those that can’t, broke; and if you can’t broke, consult. On that basis I’m off to do the latter, after a three month break. (Broke, of course, refers to being a broker, not going broke.) And because he's classy, Minack puts himself in the worst category.
"Monster equity inflows" this week show a "capitulation into equities," says BofA strategist Michael Hartnett. Equity funds increased assets under management by $14.1 billion in the week ended May 15, with $12.5 billion of that going into broad stock market ETFs. $14.1 billion in one week is on par with the big equity inflows we saw in January, when everyone was talking about a "Great Rotation" out of bond funds and into equity funds. (That's still not happening â€“ bond funds still recorded $3.4 billion in inflows this week, but it was the weakest performance in the past nine weeks.) Meanwhile, Japanese equity funds had their biggest week ever, taking in $6.8 billion, although Hartnett says the number is "inflated by new coverage of Daiwa ETF that tracks TPX." BofAML Global Research, EPFR Global Even European funds got in on the fun, taking in $0.5 billion â€“ the first inflows into Europe in 12 weeks. Precious metals funds saw $1.1 billion in outflows, extending the streak of outflows to 14 weeks â€“ the longest on record. The table below shows a breakdown of equity fund flows by region.

Bloomberg TelevisionMorgan Stanley's Gerard Minack is arguably the most underrated strategist on Wall Street. His two-page "Downunder Daily" reports were must-reads for anyone looking for a clear, straightforward perspective on the state of the markets. While we're sad to hear that he's retiring, we love his last note. "Investing is an unusual profession: perhaps the only one where amateurs have a good shot at beating the pros," said Minack as he opened his note today. He tackles the long history of how actively-managed mutual funds (i.e. funds that try to beat the indexes) almost always underperform the indexes.Â  Here's a chart from one of the many studies showing the history: Morgan Stanley, Gerard Minack "Amateurs normally stand no chance against professionals," he writes, noting that most of us would be unlikely to play tennis better than Roger Federer or golf better than Tiger Woods. "Investing is different," he continued. "None of this would matter if achieving index returns was extremely difficult. But an industryâ€™s been built on indexed funds that seem capable of replicating index returns at relatively low cost." So why are the pros still in business? Minack summarizes: ...The good news for the professionals is that many amateurs persist in trying to beat the market and, in aggregate, they seem to do a significantly worse job than the professionals The biggest problem appears to be that â€“ despite all the disclaimers â€“ retail flows assume that past performance is a good guide to future outcomes. Consequently money tends to flow to investments that have done well, rather than investments that will do well. The net result is that the actual returns to investors fall well short not just of benchmark returns, but the returns generated by professional investors. So, you have two things going on here: 1) Investors think actively-managed funds that have done well in the past will do well in the future. The chart above demonstrates why this type of thinking puts you way behind the curve. 2) Investors, because of behavioral biases, will load up on the highs and sell at the lows.Â  As a result, investors will underperform the very investment that they are investing in. This second point is extremely important. Minack demonstrates this in two charts. In this first chart, the green line shows investor flows, which shows that investors buy high and sell low: Morgan Stanley, Gerard Minack This second chart demonstrates the implications of the mistake made above.Â  It shows investors' dollar-weighted returns.Â  In other words, it shows what happens to returns when an investor buys high and sells low. Morgan Stanley, Gerard Minack In this example, an investor who bought the index for $100 in 1997 and waited patiently would have around $150 today.Â  However, the person who followed their gut, and traded with market fluctuations would've lost 75%. Minack concludes: In short, amateurs may be able to beat the investment professionals, but most do far worse. This keeps professional investors in business (and that keeps people like me employed, which is nice). But it means that returns to investors typically lag benchmark returns by a long margin. The outlook, in my view, is for low returns ahead, as measured by common benchmarks. If investors continue to receive materially worse returns than those benchmarks, effective returns are likely to be derisory. In other words, people like Minack have jobs because you're probably stupid. So with that, Minack announced that he was leaving Morgan: Iâ€™m retiring from Morgan Stanley, so this is my last note. Thanks for the brickbats and bouquets over the years â€“ at least I knew you were reading. Iâ€™ve always said that those that can, do; those that canâ€™t, broke; and if you canâ€™t broke, consult. On that basis Iâ€™m off to do the latter, after a three month break.Cheers, Gerard We'll miss him.

Bloomberg TelevisionJPMorgan's bullish analyst Tom Lee just cranked up his S&amp;P forecast: This has been a better bull market than we expected, particularly in 2013. But this is conforming to historyâ€”the average gain in the fifth year of a bull market is 19% (implies 1,719). The S&amp;P 500 closed on 5/16 at 1,650, above our original target of 1,580, thus we are raising our YE target to 1,715, based on a 14.7x P/E on our 2014E EPS of $117. We realize investors are apprehensive about making fresh money purchases, but we see the risk/reward as particularly attractive in Technology, Healthcare, and Financials.
Flickr/ToastyKenThe Eurozone still faces a gigantic economic crisis, but the decline in Greek bond yields should serve as a clear indicator that the acute sovereign debt/financial crisis part of this is over. Katie Martin at WSJ has a great post up about a new Deutsche Bank note, which argues that as the Eurozone crisis ends, the Euro could fall. Wha? From the post: In the words of Bilal Hafeez and George Saravelos at Deutsche: â€œThe big story over the last five years has not been a lack of inflows into the euro area, which have remained remarkably steady. It has been domestic risk aversion. This has seen large waves of repatriation and the building of more than EUR1 trillion worth of underweights in foreign assets. Lower tail risks and a gradually improving business cycle should see a return of these outflows.â€ During the darkest days of the crisis, investors/banks/individuals/etc. hoarded up Euros, which is natural crisis behavior. This creates a bid under the price. Now that the panic is fading, there's less reason to hoard Euros, and you can diversify into other things again. The logic isn't that different then what we saw with the US dollar, just on a lesser scale. Remember, the dollar spiked during the worst of the 2008-2009 financial crisis. Then it tanked immediately once the crisis was over. FRED Now it's a little different with the dollar, since it has a special "safe-haven" role for investors around the world, but the premise isn't that different. When it all hits the fan, you reach for the currency you need to pay your bills in... your home currency. And when things ease up, you can diversify again into assets denominated in other currencies. Another similarity is to the way the yen spiked in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake in March 2011. In a crisis, people reach for their currency, because they need it. When the crisis fades, the bid dissipates.
Here's your reminder that the economic collapse in Greece has given rise to a sizable Neo-Nazi contingent (the Golden Dawn) in parliament. At the :36 mark in this video you can hear a member of the party shout "Heil Hitler." According to Ekathimerini, he was later thrown out. (Via Gregor Peter) 
wikiThe market is seemingly in can't-lose mode. When there's good news, stocks spike. When there's bad news, stocks go nowhere. Lots of people say this is all the doing of the Fed, and that it's a bubble that will end in tears. In a great, thorough post, Josh Brown destroys the comparisons between 2013 and 1999 in utterly convincing manner. It's a very thorough post which attacks this comparison in multiple ways. The simplest debunking is on valuation. Right now, he notes, the S&amp;P 500 is earning twice what is was in 1999. And the dividends are twice as big as well: What kind of premium, pray tell, are we paying for double the earnings and twice the dividend yield versus 1999's market? I'm so glad you asked - turns out we're not paying any premium at all. We're paying a discount. 50% off. The current S&amp;P 500 trades for a PE of 14 versus 33 for 1999. So double the fundamentals for half the price. And he destroys the idea that there's speculation everywhere by reminding readers what the scene was really like in 1999, for those who have forgotten: In 1999, the S&amp;P 500 rose by 19.5% - a good gain but you should know that the gains were extremely concentrated, more than half of the companies in the S&amp;P were actually negative on the year! The Nasdaq 100 was up an astounding 85% in 1999, a mania for the ages, but an extremely sector-specific one. This contrasts with today, where almost every sector is now participating in the advance in a rolling, rotating, sexually undulating manner not unlike the midriff of a belly dancer. In 1999, the market was led by Qualcomm, whichÂ went up 2,619 percent during the course of the year. There were twelve other Nasdaq tech stocks that gained more than 1,000 percent that year and seven more that were up over 900%. These companies were hardly earning any money and many of them had been founded just hours before coming public. There was more than $50 billion in IPO issuance that year, with profit-challenged tech stocks representing about half of that, more than 200 of them went public in 12 months and on average they debuted with an 80% gain. And unlike in 1999, nobody really cares about this market: Stock market-focused websites are having trouble finding a reason toÂ continueÂ existing given the swindling population of hobbyist investors. There is a finite number of people who want alerts and stock picks (TheStreet.com estimates it is 3 million and I would take the under). It is an old audience with nostalgia for the 1982-2000 bull market and it is dying slowly but incessantly. It is not being replaced with new enthusiasts, Gen Xers are disillusioned, Gen Yers are bored with it and theÂ MillennialsÂ are scared to death and think stocks are the devil. And so he concludes: This is nothing like 1999 other than the fact that stocks are going up. This doesn't mean that they can't go down, it simply means that being in the market now isn't crazy or stupid or reckless. Being out of market, on the other hand, with a retirement somewhere far out on the horizon, is the height of recklessness, the opposite of conservative. Read the whole post, it's great --&gt;
Here's more proof that the crisis in Europe is no longer about debt, but about the real economy. Even in Greece, there's been a gigantic rally in government debt.

Given the crucial role of housing to the economic recovery, there's suddenly a lot of interest in what's going on with lumber futures, which has been on the decline. SoberLook has the chart: SoberLook The questions is whether this is something about the US housing market (which is conceivable, given that housing starts missed expectations yesterday) or whether it's got more to do with the global commodity decline, and thus perhaps China-related. Jonathan Krinksy of Miller Tabak wrote about lumber in a note to clients yesterday: Lumber prices and the Homebuilding Stocks have a pretty high correlation for obvious reasons. They generally move higher together, and lower together, over longer periods of time. When they start diverging, however, we should probably take notice. Maybe the biggest negative divergence in recent history was from 2004 to 2005. Lumber futures peaked in the late summer of 2004. Yet the S&amp;P 500 Homebuilders Index pushed higher until peaking nearly a year later in July 2005. We have a similar set-up currently taking place, in that Lumber prices peaked in February of this year, and are now down over 20% from recent highs. Yet the S&amp;P 500 Homebuilders have kept marching higher, hitting a recent high yesterday. Anyway, watch this space.
This weekâ€™s rail traffic reading showed modest improvement over recent weeks, but the longer-term trend remains negative. Â Intermodal traffic was up 3.9% this week which was an improvement over last weekâ€™s reading of 2.8%. Â The data, however, continues to soften on a rolling 3 month basis with the latest reading coming in at 3%. Â Thatâ€™s the lowest level since January. Â The good news is weâ€™re not seeing the type of consistently negative readings that tend to precede a recession. Â The bad news is that the growth is tapering. Hereâ€™s more via AAR: â€œThe Association of American Railroads (AAR) reported an increase in traffic for the week ending May 11, 2013, with total U.S. weekly carloads of 280,986 carloads, up 0.6 percent compared with the same week last year. Intermodal volume for the week totaled 248,266 units, up 3.9 percent compared with the same week last year. Total U.S. traffic for the week was 529,252 carloads and intermodal units, up 2.1 percent compared with the same week last year. Five of the 10 carload commodity groups posted increases compared with the same week in 2012, led by petroleum and petroleum products, up 50.8 percent.

Shutterstock.com / Andriy MarkovAt the moment, we're looking at a very quiet last day of the week. Around the world, there isn't much happening in markets. Japan was up modestly. China was up decently (to the tune of 1.4%). Europe is mixed with some markets a little up, and others a little lower. US futures are a bit higher. Later today we get Michigan Consumer Sentiment, but that's about it. The big theme for the week: Data still kind of spotty, but markets still pretty buoyant.
Wikimedia CommonsNOTE: Earlier, we had written that Ric Deverall's commentary is from a research note to clients.  Deverall actually made these statements live to reporters in London. Bearish sentiment toward gold has prices for the yellow metal tumbling again. On Wednesday, George Soros revealed through a regulatory filing that he cut his gold exposure during the first quarter. Speaking to reporters in London, Credit Suisse's Ric Deverall forecasted that gold would plunge to $1,100 this year and eventually to $1,000 within five years.  This according to Bloomberg's Maria Kolesnikova. More from Kolesnikova: “Gold is going to get crushed,” Deverell told reporters in London today. “The need to buy gold for wealth preservation fell down and the probability of inflation on a one- to three-year horizon is significantly diminished.” ...“When gold is going up, it looks like a great idea to buy more gold,” Deverell said. “And when it’s going down, do you really think risk-averse central bankers are going to try and catch the knife? No.” Deverell was responding to the latest stats on central bank gold reserves.  According to a new report from the World Gold Council, these banks bought around 109 tonnes of gold in the first quarter, marking the seventh straight quarter of net purchases.
DoubleLine FundsJeff GundlachThe legend of bond investing god Jeff Gundlach continues to grow. After making a name for himself by accurately predicting the trajectory of interest rates, Gundlach also made successful calls on natural gas, Japanese stocks, and Apple. After getting burglarized, he even played a critical role in tracking down his stolen goods. All of the public success has caused his assets under management to balloon to around $60 billion. Reuters' Samuel Forgione and Jennifer Ablan have a new interview with Gundlach. It includes a story proving the bond god's elevated status: All of these calls have elevated Gundlach into something of a rock star, even in jaded Los Angeles where entertainment celebrities, not money managers, rule the roost. He was in an elevator at a local Whole Foods grocery store with the actor Mel Gibson and a third person, he told Reuters. But it wasn't Gibson who caught the other person's eye, it was Gundlach. "The guy looks around the elevator and looks at me and says: 'You're Jeffrey Gundlach,'" said Gundlach, chuckling a bit. Read the whole profile at Reuters.com.
