The drill also included strong electromagnetic interference to simulate a real combat scenario. The fighters covered for each other in a concealed raid and the targets were hit. The drill was launched after the General Staff of the Peopleâ€™s Liberation Army issued the Military Training Instructions for 2013. It said all army forces and armed police should strengthen combat and information warfare training and step up the modernization of the military, so it can engage in and win wars.Commentary: Rational policy needed from Abe government on China-Japan ties - Xinhua | English.news.cn- At a meeting in Beijing on Monday, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Fu Ying and former Japanese Education Minister Kenji Kosaka agreed that the two countries should shift their focus back to development of the strategic relationship of mutual benefit. The talks, expected to pave the way for a possible visit to China by Abe's special envoy Masahiko Komura, marked the first time a Japanese ruling party lawmaker met with a senior Chinese official since the launch of the Abe government.äººæ°‘æ—¥æŠ¥-â€œæ–°å››åŒ–â€ æ–°æ„åœ¨ä½•å¤„ï¼ˆæ–°è®ºï¼‰ æ˜“ é¹Â  People's Daily on the "new four modernizations" Li Keqiang stressing//æ¢¦æƒ³æ¿€åŠ±äººä»¬å‰è¿›ï¼Œå®ç°éœ€è¦è„šè¸å®åœ°ã€‚â€œå››ä¸ªç°ä»£åŒ–â€çš„å®ä¼Ÿç†æƒ³æ¿€åŠ±å‡ ä»£ä¸­å›½äººä¸ºä¹‹å¥‹æ–—ï¼Œä»Šå¤©çš„ä¸­å›½å› æ­¤å–å¾—äº†å·¨å¤§æˆå°±ã€‚15æ—¥ï¼Œæå…‹å¼ºåŒå¿—åœ¨å›½å®¶ç²®é£Ÿå±€è€ƒå¯Ÿè°ƒç ”æ—¶å¼ºè°ƒï¼Œæ¨è¿›æ–°å‹å·¥ä¸šåŒ–ã€ä¿¡æ¯åŒ–ã€åŸé•‡åŒ–å’Œå†œä¸šç°ä»£åŒ–çš„â€œæ–°å››åŒ–â€å»ºè®¾æ˜¯ä¸­å›½ç°ä»£åŒ–çš„å¿…ç”±ä¹‹è·¯ã€‚â€œæ–°å››åŒ–â€ï¼Œæ›´å…·æ—¶ä»£æ„Ÿåœ°å‹¾ç”»äº†å»ºè®¾ä¸­å›½ç°ä»£åŒ–çš„å…·ä½“ä¹‹è·¯ã€‚China's Tencent Apologizes for Message Problems - WSJ.com- It is standard practice to block sensitive terms in China. The government gives Internet companies such as Tencent general guidelines for censorship, leaving most companies to make their own decisions in many cases. That sometimes leaves individual companies to make the tough calculation between pleasing domestic censors and serving international users. Activists also say Chinese Internet services are broadly used by the Chinese government to track their movements. Last week, an anticensorship activist at the Southern Weekly protests who had been detained by authorities for a day told The Wall Street Journal that his only activity before he was picked up was communicating with his friends via WeChat.

There is no taboo around pot smoking in the country â€“ many North Koreans know the drug exists and have smoked it. In North Korea, the drug goes by the name of ip tambae or â€œleaf tobacco.â€ It is reported to be especially popular amongst young soldiers in the North Korean military â€“ rather than getting hooked on tar &amp; nicotine like their contemporaries in the West, they fraternize without fear of repercussion by lighting up king-sized doobies during down time on the military beat.United Family Home Health - interesting new service, probably a big market among rich Chinese in Beijing..house calls the ultimate luxury, especially in China// United Family Home Health is one of the first home care services in China with a medical focus, and its vision is to provide clients and their families with United Family Healthcare's world-class medical care from the comfort of their homes.BUSINESS AND ECONOMYChina Set to Exit Slowdown as Government Supports Infrastructure - Bloomberg - The National Bureau of Statistics will report tomorrow that gross domestic product expanded 7.8 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, according to the median estimate of 53 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. Thatâ€™s up from a three-year low of 7.4 percent in the previous period. The risk is that the rebound may fade in the second half as the boost from railways and road projects ebbs and the government grapples with rising inflation and the expansion of shadow banking.

With hindsight, we now know that the poem in fact foretold a doomed voyage for Mr Tao. He could not ride the wind and was eventually swallowed up by the waves. Mr Tao was detained in June for an investigation into â€œpersonal economic issuesâ€. State media reported last week that he has been formally charged with corruption. It is alleged that he made illegal loans with bank money for personal benefit. Mr Taoâ€™s downfall is a timely reminder of what remains the biggest problem in the Chinese financial system: an excessive concentration of money in the hands of state-run banks.Deloitte Tightens Client Screening After China Scandals - WSJ.com-a joke..Deloitte didn't have standards before? and will this mean any deloitte-audited China firm should no longer be put on the "likely good short idea" list?//Â  Deloitte's Asia Pacific CEO, Chaly Mah, said the firm has specifically changed the work it does to test cash balances and introduced more stringent tests to determine whether to take on potential clients, for instance."We have a multilayer process but if you have clients that are less than honest it is not easy," he said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal.Report says sick chickens sold[1]|chinadaily.com.cn- A major chicken supplier in Central China has been suspected of selling sick birds to popular food chains including KFC, in the latest crisis to hit the country's poultry industry.According to a report on china.com.cn on Tuesday, several chicken farms owned by Doyoo Group in Henan province have been providing sick birds to the group, which resells the chickens to fast-food chains such as KFC and McDonald's.Agricultural products price continually rises in China - Xinhua | English.news.cn - the price of agricultural products in 36 large-and-medium-sized cities across the nation continued to rise from Jan. 7, 2013 to Jan. 13, 2013, a continuous rising in 11 consecutive weeksä¸€çº¿åŸå¸‚è°ƒæ§å›°å¢ƒï¼šå›½ä¼çš„ç‹‚æ¬¢ï¼Ÿ|æˆ¿åœ°äº§|ä¸€çº¿åŸå¸‚|è°ƒæ§_21ä¸–çºªç½‘ - real estate controls have turned out to be benefecial to the big SOEs, at least in first tier one cities...caused some pain at start but now they are most of the last ones standing...//æ ¸å¿ƒæç¤ºï¼š2012å¹´ï¼ŒåŒ—äº¬æˆ¿ä¼å•†å“æˆ¿é”€å”®é‡‘é¢æ’è¡Œæ¦œä¸­ï¼ŒåŒ—äº¬åŸå»ºã€ä¸­æµ·ã€ä¿åˆ©ã€é¦–å¼€ã€ä¸­å›½é“å»ºã€ä¸­åŒ–æ–¹å…´ç­‰å›½ä¼ä»¥è¿…çŒ›çš„æ€åŠ¿æŠ¢å äº†å‰ååï¼Œæ°‘ä¼åªæœ‰é¾™æ¹–ã€SOHOä¸­å›½å°šå­˜ã€‚èŒ…å°æ•´æ”¹ï¼šåè…æ½®åŠ å¿«ç™½é…’ä¸šå…¨é¢å¸‚åœºåŒ– | æ¯ç»æ™ºåº“ - Moutai is in a big mess..not just corruption crackdown but big sales channel and administrative issues// æ ¸å¿ƒæç¤ºï¼š è™½ç„¶è¿™åœºè²Œä¼¼å‡­å€Ÿåè…çš„ä¸œé£ï¼Œå›½å®¶åˆåŠ¨ç”¨äº†è¡Œæ”¿æ‰‹æ®µæ¥é™åˆ¶èŒ…å°çš„ä»·æ ¼ï¼Œå…¶å®å´æ˜¯åœ¨åŠ¨ç”¨å¸‚åœºç»æµçš„æ‰‹ï¼ŒåŠ é€Ÿä»¥èŒ…å°ä¸ºé¦–çš„é«˜ç«¯ç™½é…’ä¼ä¸šå®ç°å…¨é¢å¸‚åœºåŒ–çš„è¿›ç¨‹ã€‚è°åœ¨æ¨æ¶¨é“çŸ¿çŸ³_æ‚å¿—é¢‘é“_è´¢æ–°ç½‘ - Caixin on who is pushing up price of iron ore// ä»2012å¹´9æœˆè‡³ä»Šï¼Œè¿›å£é“çŸ¿çŸ³ä»·æ ¼ç”±ä¸è¶³90ç¾å…ƒ/å¨ä¸€è·¯ç‹‚æ¶¨è‡³å½“å‰çš„155ç¾å…ƒ/å¨ï¼Œæ¶¨å¹…è¾¾75.1%ã€‚ç‰¹åˆ«æ˜¯è¿›å…¥12æœˆä»¥åï¼ŒçŸ¿ä»·åŠ é€Ÿä¸Šæ‰¬ï¼ŒçŸ­çŸ­ä¸€ä¸ªæœˆæ—¶é—´ç«Ÿç–¯ç‹‚ä¸Šæ¶¨äº†è¿‘40ç¾å…ƒï¼Œæ¶¨å¹…é«˜è¾¾31.4%ã€‚2013å¹´1æœˆ8æ—¥ï¼ŒåŠ›æ‹“çš„PBï¼ˆçš®å°”å·´æ‹‰æ··åˆçŸ¿ï¼‰ç²‰çŸ¿æ‹›æ ‡ä»·æ ¼å·²æ¥è¿‘æ¯å¨160ç¾å…ƒã€‚åˆ°åº•æ˜¯ä»€ä¹ˆå› ç´ åœ¨æ¨åŠ¨é“çŸ¿çŸ³ä»·æ ¼çš„ç–¯æ¶¨ï¼ŸCorruption curbs crimp luxury market |Economy |chinadaily.com.cn- Ren said government officials, who used to be the main recipients of luxury watches as gifts, were unsure about the future policy environment.Several government officials who were noticed by the public to own luxury watches were investigated for corruption in 2012.

Flcikr/arimooreWEATHERFORD, Texas (AP) â€” When a man in a Fort Worth suburb reported his family's drinking water had begun bubbling like champagne, the federal government sounded an alarm: A company may have tainted their wells while drilling for natural gas. At first, the Environmental Protection Agency believed the situation was so serious that it issued a rare emergency order in late 2010 that said at least two homeowners were in immediate danger from a well saturated with flammable methane. More than a year later, the agency rescinded its mandate and refused to explain why. Now a confidential report obtained by The Associated Press and interviews with company representatives show that the EPA had scientific evidence against the driller, Range Resources, but changed course after the company threatened not to cooperate with a national study into a common form of drilling called hydraulic fracturing. Regulators set aside an analysis that concluded the drilling could have been to blame for the contamination. For Steve Lipsky, the EPA decision seemed to ignore the dangers to his family. His water supply contains so much methane that the gas in water flowing from a pipe connected to the well can be ignited. "I just can't believe that an agency that knows the truth about something like that, or has evidence like this, wouldn't use it," said Lipsky, who fears he will have to abandon his dream home in an upscale neighborhood of Weatherford. The case isn't the first in which the EPA initially linked a hydraulic fracturing operation to water contamination and then softened its position after the industry protested. A similar dispute unfolded in west-central Wyoming in late 2011, when the EPA released an initial report that showed hydraulic fracturing could have contaminated groundwater. After industry and GOP leaders went on the attack, the agency said it had decided to do more testing. It has yet to announce a final conclusion. Hydraulic fracturing â€” often called "fracking" â€” allows drillers to tap into oil and gas reserves that were once considered out of reach because they were locked in deep layers of rock. The method has contributed to a surge in natural gas drilling nationwide, but environmental activists and some scientists believe it can contaminate groundwater. The industry insists the practice is safe. Range Resources, a leading independent player in the natural gas boom, has hundreds of gas wells throughout Texas, Pennsylvania and other mineral-rich areas of the United States. Among them is a production site â€” now owned by Legend Natural Gas â€” in a wooded area about a mile from Lipsky's home in Weatherford, about a half-hour drive west of Fort Worth. State agencies usually regulate water and air pollution, so the EPA's involvement in the Texas matter was unusual from the start. The EPA began investigating complaints about the methane in December 2010, because it said the Texas Railroad Commission, which oversees oil and gas drilling, had not responded quickly enough to the reports of bubbling water. Government scientists believed two families, including the Lipskys, were in danger from methane and cancer-causing benzene and ordered Range Resources to take steps to clean their water wells and provide affected homeowners with safe water. The company stopped doing that after state regulators declared in March 2011 that Range Resources was not responsible. The dispute between the EPA and the company then moved into federal court. Believing the case was headed for a lengthy legal battle, the EPA asked an independent scientist named Geoffrey Thyne to analyze water samples taken from 32 water wells. In the report obtained by the AP, Thyne concluded from chemical testing that the gas in the drinking water could have originated from Range Resources' nearby drilling operation. Meanwhile, the EPA was seeking industry leaders to participate in a national study into hydraulic fracturing. Range Resources told EPA officials in Washington that so long as the agency continued to pursue a "scientifically baseless" action against the company in Weatherford, it would not take part in the study and would not allow government scientists onto its drilling sites, said company attorney David Poole. In March 2012, the EPA retracted its emergency order, halted the court battle and set aside Thyne's report showing that the gas in Lipsky's water was nearly identical to the gases the Plano, Texas-based company was producing. "They said that they would look into it, which I believe is exactly what they did," Poole said. "I'm proud of them. As an American, I think that's exactly what they should have done." The EPA offered no public explanation for its change in thinking, and Lipsky said he and his family learned about it from a reporter. The agency refused to answer questions about the decision, instead issuing a statement by email that said resolving the Range Resources matter allowed the EPA to shift its "focus in this case away from litigation and toward a joint effort on the science and safety of energy extraction." Rob Jackson, chairman of global environmental change at Duke University's Nicholas School of the Environment, reviewed Thyne's report and the raw data upon which it was based. He agreed the gas in Lipsky's well could have originated in a rock formation known as the Barnett shale, the same area where Range Resources was extracting gas. Jackson said it was "premature" to withdraw the order and said the EPA "dropped the ball in dropping their investigation." Lipsky, who is still tied up in a legal battle with Range Resources, now pays about $1,000 a month to haul water to his home. He, his wife and three children become unnerved when their methane detectors go off. Sometime soon, he said, the family will have to decide whether to stay in the large stone house or move. "This has been total hell," Lipsky said. "It's been taking a huge toll on my family and on our life." The confidential report relied on a type of testing known as isotopic analysis, which produces a unique chemical fingerprint that sometimes allows researchers to trace the origin of gas or oil. Jackson, who studies hydraulic fracturing and specializes in isotopic analysis, acknowledged that more data is needed to determine for certain where the gas came from. But even if the gas came from elsewhere, Range Resources' drilling could have contributed to the problem in Lipsky's water because gas migrates, he added. The company insists the gas in Lipsky's water is from natural migration and not drilling. Range Resources' testing indicates the gas came from a different rock formation called Strawn shale and not the deeper Barnett shale, Poole said. In addition, he said, isotopic analysis cannot be used in this case because the chemical makeup of the gases in the two formations is indistinguishable. A Range Resources spokesman also dismissed Thyne and Jackson as anti-industry. Range Resources has not shared its data with the EPA or the Railroad Commission. Poole said the data is proprietary and could only be seen by Houston-based Weatherford Laboratories, where it originated. It was analyzed for Range Resources by a Weatherford scientist, Mark McCaffrey, who did not respond to requests for an interview. Gas has always been in the water in that area, Poole said. And years before Range Resources began drilling, at least one water well in the neighborhood contained so much methane, it went up in flames. At another home with dangerously high methane levels in the water, the company insisted the gas had been there since the well was first dug many years ago. The homeowner was not aware of anything wrong until Range Resources began drilling in 2009. Jackson said it was "unrealistic" to suggest that people could have tainted water and not notice. "It bubbles like champagne or mineral waters," he said. "The notion that people would have wells and have this in their water and not see this is wrong." ___ Associated Press writers Nomaan Merchant in Dallas, Allen Breed in Raleigh, N.C., and Michael Rubinkam in Allentown, Pa., contributed to this report. ___ Plushnick-Masti can be followed on Twitter at https://twitter.com/RamitMastiAP Copyright (2013) Associated Press.

flickrandrewtallonAustralia vs. New Zealand Australia's December employment figures are out. Employment fell by 5,500 in December.Â  Economists surveyed by Bloomberg were looking for a 4,000 gain. The unemployment rate was revised up to 5.3 percent from a previous reading of 5.2 percent. Australia, an economy largely driven by mining, has struggled as its trading partners like China have slowed down. It's "a credit bubble built on a commodity market built on an even bigger Chinese credit bubble," wrote strategist Dylan Grice about Australia.
[Many longtime followers of the Crash Course have asked Chris to update his forecasts for Peak Oil in light of the production increases in shale oil and gas over recent years. What started out as a modest effort at clarification morphed into a much more massive 3-report treatise as Chris sifted through mountains of new data that ultimately left him more convinced than ever we are facing a global net energy crisis – despite misguided media efforts intended to convince us otherwise. His reports are being released in series over the next several weeks; the first installment is below.] There has been a very strong and concerted public-relations effort to spin the recent shale energy plays of the U.S. as complete game-changers for the world energy outlook.  These efforts do not square up well with the data and are creating a vast misperception about the current risks and future opportunities among the general populace and energy organizations alike.  The world remains quite hopelessly addicted to petroleum, and the future will be shaped by scarcity – not abundance, as some have claimed. This series of reports will assemble the relevant data into a simple and easy-to-understand story that has the appropriate context to provide a meaningful place to begin a conversation and make decisions. Since completing the Crash Course in October of 2008, much has gone as I anticipated in the way of money printing, official neglect of the main predicaments we face, and generally higher petroleum costs (2012 was the record so far on a yearly basis). What has not changed is the general trajectory of liquid fuels becoming increasingly expensive and more difficult to produce.  I know that this runs counter to virtually every news article that has come out recently.  It is time to separate the data and facts from the hype.  Much has recently been either muddied or presented so far out of context as to be more distortive than helpful. This entire body of analysis is so large that it will be broken into three pieces.  The first is a general world outlook for petroleum that presents the macro picture, provides some necessary clarifications on definitions, and illustrates that all of the data is consistent with the idea that the world is on a plateau of oil production.  Here we note that exactly zero of the major energy outlooks provided by the IEA, the EIA, PB, and especially the inexcusably sloppy piece put out under the auspices of Harvard (the Maugheri report of 2012) all failed to make any mention of the declining net energy provided by any of the new unconventional oil finds.  This is a crucial oversight. The second report will focus on natural gas in the U.S., with a particular emphasis on shale gas, the supposed game-changer that we have read so much about.  There are some very important elements to this story, but the punch line is that there's nowhere near "100 years" of this magic fuel, it costs more to produce than it is being sold for at present here in early 2013, and – once we include the idea of future increases in consumption – there may only be in the vicinity of 20-30 years of proven and probable reserves. And that is if and only if prices rise by a factor of 2.5x or more from the current $3.30 per therm market price.  The third will focus on tight oil, often called shale oil (not to be confused with oil shale, a very common mistake), and make the case that, while it may have some modifying effect to the Peak Oil story, it lacks the ability to return the world to anywhere near its prior glory years of ~2% per year growth in global oil output.  The summary of all three reports leads to the conclusion that all efforts to cram the world full of fresh rounds of new debt lending are going to end in failure because the requisite net energy is simply not there to support continued debt accumulations running several-fold faster than actual economic productive output. Enormous risks are continuing to build in the world's financial landscape, and the continued unwillingness to confront the truth about our global energy predicament is both puzzling and frightening. The conclusion is that our future resilience as individuals, corporations, or countries will hinge to a very large degree on whether or not we heed the warning signs and adapt our lives and habits to the actual circumstances. The really big picture goes like this:  Humans discovered about 400 million years worth of stored sunlight in the form of coal, oil, and natural gas, and have developed technologies that will essentially see all of that treasure burned up in just 300 to 400 years.  On the faulty assumption that fossil fuels will always be a resource we could draw upon, we fashioned economic, monetary, and other assorted belief systems based on permanent abundance, plus a species population on track to number around 9 billion souls by 2050. There are two numbers to keep firmly in mind.  The first is 22, and the other is 10.  In the past 22 years, half of all of the oil ever burned has been burned.  Such is the nature of exponentially increasing demand.  And the oil burned in the last 22 years was the easy and cheap stuff discovered 30 to 40 years ago.  Which brings us to the number 10.   In every calorie of food that comes to your table are hidden 10 calories of fossil fuels, making modern agriculture and food delivery the first type in history that consumes more energy than it delivers.  Someday fossil fuels will be all gone.  That day may be far off in the future, but preparing for that day could (and one could argue should) easily require every bit of time we have.  What galls me at this stage is that all of the pronouncements of additional oil being squeezed, fractured, and otherwise expensively coaxed out of the ground are being delivered with the message that there's so much available, there's nothing to worry about (at least, not yet.)  The message seems to be that we can just leave those challenges for future people, who we expect to be at least as clever as us, so they'll surely manage just fine. Instead, the chart above illustrates that on a reasonably significant timeline, the age of fossil fuels will be intense and historically quite short.  The real question is not Will it run out? but Where would we like to be, and what should the future look like when it finally runs out?  The former question suggests that "maintain the status quo" is the correct response, while the latter question suggests that we had better be investing this once-in-a-species bequeathment very judiciously and wisely.  Energy is vital to our economy and our easy, modern lives.  Without energy, there would be no economy.  The more expensive our energy is, the more of our economy is dedicated to getting energy instead of other pursuits and activities.  Among the various forms of energy, petroleum is the king of transportation fuels and is indispensable to our global economy and way of life. To what do we owe the recent explosion in technology and living standards?  To me the answer is simple: energy.   (Source) Because a very large proportion of our society was no longer tied up with the time-consuming tasks of growing their own food or building and heating their own shelter, they were free to do other very clever things, like devote their lives to advancing technology.   When energy starts to get out of reach either economically or geologically, then people revert to more basic things, like trying to stay warm – such as this fellow: Jan 11, 2013 EGALEO, Greece—While patrolling on a recent cold night, environmentalist Grigoris Gourdomichalis caught a young man illegally chopping down a tree on public land in the mountains above Athens. When confronted, the man broke down in tears, saying he was unemployed and needed the wood to warm the home he shares with his wife and four small children, because he could no longer afford heating oil. "It was a tough choice, but I decided just to let him go" with the wood, said Mr. Gourdomichalis, head of the locally financed Environmental Association of Municipalities of Athens, which works to protect forests around Egaleo, a western suburb of the capital. Tens of thousands of trees have disappeared from parks and woodlands this winter across Greece, authorities said, in a worsening problem that has had tragic consequences as the crisis-hit country's impoverished residents, too broke to pay for electricity or fuel, turn to fireplaces and wood stoves for heat. I think it is safe to assume that all of the people in Greece who are chopping down trees to stay warm are not simultaneously working on the next generation of technology.  Energy first; everything else second.  In other words, our perceived wealth and well-being are both derivatives of energy.  Like every other organism bestowed with abundant food – in this case, fossil fuels that we have converted into food, mobility, shelter, warmth, and a vast array of consumer goods – we first embarked on a remarkable path of exponential population growth.  Along with these assorted freedoms from securing the basics of living, we also fashioned monetary and economic systems that are fully dependent on perpetual exponential growth for their vitality and well-being.  These, too, owe their very sustenance to energy. It bears repeating:  Not just energy is important here, but net energy.  It's the energy left over after we find and produce energy that is available for society to do all of its complicated and clever things. Not only is the world struggling right now to increase global oil production, but all of the new and unconventional finds offer us dramatically less net energy to use as we wish.  One narrative that is being heavily marketed right now is that the shale plays are true game-changers and there's really nothing to worry about for the foreseeable future.  Heck, the story says that the U.S. will soon exceed Saudi Arabia in oil production and become energy independent, that it has so much natural gas that it might as well build export terminals, and that there's 100 years of natural gas just waiting to be used. Unfortunately, none of this is really true.  Here's how I can make the case for that assertion using just three charts.  This first chart comes to us from the EIA courtesy of one Mr. Sweetnam, a former director at the EIA who was promptly reassigned to a distant position when his superiors discovered that this chart revealing declines in existing conventional oil fields had been released to the public.  What this graph shows is the projected decline of all known projects in 2009 (so this does not have the U.S. shale 'revolution' baked into it, but I'll get to that shortly), and it shows that those projects are going to slip from delivering 85 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil to just 45 million bpd between 2012 and 2030.  In other words, 40 million bpd will go missing.  But it's worse than that, because demand is expected to grow, leaving a gap of more than 60 million bpd by 2030. If that sounds like a lot, it is, but that's just an assumed rate of production decline of 4.8% per year, which is right in the midzone of expert estimates.  Some estimate decline rates as high as 6.5%, which would really amplify the drop and the resulting gap. The top line is showing how much oil demand would grow if it was going to expand at the usual historical rates.  The gap between those two modeled states is 43 million barrels.  To put that in a U.S. shale context, the EIA projects that the domestic shale plays might deliver as much as 3 million barrels per day by 2020, which is nothing to sneeze at, but even with that there's a projected 40 million bpd shortfall.  The second chart I want you to look at is this one which shows total world crude oil production over the past 12 years:  Between 2004 and 2012, the total supply of global crude oil + condensates (a definition which excludes the non-transportation fuels known as natural gas plant liquids and biofuels) has just flopped around in a tight band with only 5% wiggle. It bears noting here that the 2004 average spot price for crude oil (using the Brent contract, as that better defines the 'world oil' price) was $38.35/bbl, while the average 2012 spot price was $111.63, or 2.9 times higher than the 2004 price.  Despite this near tripling in price, the global supply is just sitting there stuck on a plateau.  Economically speaking, this is not supposed to happen.  What is supposed to happen is that suppliers will react to these higher prices and deliver more to the market, and then prices will settle down.  But that hasn't happened, which indicates that global oil supplies are, as expected, constrained by something other than market forces. This brings us to the third chart of global spending on oil projects:  What also happened during the time that global supplies of crude oil were undulating along that 5% plateau?  Global expenditures on oil projects jumped by 100% from $300 billion per year to $600 billion.  With a 100% increase in capital spending by the petroleum industry, we saw petroleum supplies remain more or less stuck in the exact same spot.  I am of the impression that $600 billion a year is a lot of money and that the people dedicating that capital are applying it to the very best projects available.  I make the further assumption that when a project is identified and pursued, it is brought on line as rapidly as possible.  There are not that many ways to look at this data other than noting that we are spending more and more to get the same...for now. If you want to know why oil costs over $110 on the world stage, the last two charts above give you the answer:  There's just not that much of it to go around. Despite all of this effort and expense, the world is basically treading water with respect to overall production.  The reason for that is contained in the first chart out of these three:  The race is now on to bring new projects on line quickly enough to offset the losses from existing fields.  Petroleum is neither a U.S. issue nor any other specific country's issue, but rather a global commodity of immense importance. While the development of the shale plays in the U.S. is of domestic importance, it has not altered the global dynamic of static oil production – at least not detectably in the global supply charts. Not yet. In Part II: How Energy Woes Will Trigger Financial Crisis, we look at the latest global petroleum supply and demand data and see clearly that cheap oil has become extinct. That era is over for humankind.  My prediction is that the underlying rates of depletion will continue to fight the recent production gains in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world until they soon come to a standstill, eventually swamping even heroic efforts.  Steadily rising energy costs and decreasing net energy yields will simply not be able to fund the future economic growth and consumptive lifestyles that developed nations are depending on (and that developing nations are aspiring to). In fact, the persistent global economic weakness we've been experiencing over the past years is an expected symptom of the throttling constraint decreasing net energy places on growth. If you care about the future of the economy, your standard of living (or that of your children), and/or your quality of life, you need to fully understand this relationship between growth and net energy. Your individual future (and our collective one) depends on it. Click here to read Part II of this report (free executive summary; enrollment required for full access).
The FAA is requiring American airlines to ground their fleets of Boeing's 787 Dreamliner passenger jet, Reuters is reporting. According to the news agency's Twitter feed, the FAA will work to "develop [a] corrective action plan" to quickly and safely resume operations, and the aircraft's batteries will be examined. According to the AP, FAA officials will address the risk of the lithium ion batteries catching on fire. The grounding will impact only United Airlines, as no other American airlines fly the Dreamliner. The news comes soon after All Nippon Airways (ANA) and Japan Airlines each voluntarily grounded their fleets of Dreamliners earlier today, after an ANA 787 had to make an emergency landing because of a battery malfunction. That was the latest in a long series of problems for the 787, including cracked cockpit windows, fuel leaks, computer errors, and a fire in the belly of a Dreamliner on the tarmac at Boston's Logan International Airport on January 7. The aircraft's use of new technologies like composite materials and electrical systems led to delays in its development. The 787 entered service in September 2011, three and a half years behind schedule. The Dreamliner is the only aircraft certified to use a lithium ion battery, which the FAA allowed only with several "special conditions." On January 11, the FAA announced a comprehensive review of the Dreamliner that would cover the plane's design and manufacturing, but the planes were not grounded at the time. That day, FAA Administrator Michael P. Huerta said in a statement: "We are confident that the aircraft is safe. But we need to have a complete understanding of what is happening." In its own statement the same day, Boeing said: "Like the 777, at 15 months of service, we are seeing the 787's fleet wide dispatch reliability well above 90 percent." "Just like any new airplane program, we move through these issues and move on," Dreamliner Chief Engineer Mike Sinnett said in a conference call. "We're not satisfied until our reliability and our performance are 100 percent." In a statement on the FAA grounding, Boeing CEO Jim McNerney stood behind the 787: Boeing is committed to supporting the FAA and finding answers as quickly as possible. The company is working around the clock with its customers and the various regulatory and investigative authorities. We will make available the entire resources of The Boeing Company to assist. We are confident the 787 is safe and we stand behind its overall integrity.  We will be taking every necessary step in the coming days to assure our customers and the traveling public of the 787's safety and to return the airplanes to service. Boeing deeply regrets the impact that recent events have had on the operating schedules of our customers and the inconvenience to them and their passengers.
The World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Report for 2012-2013 exposes that U.S. infrastructure compares unfavorably with that of most advanced countries and even some developing nations. The report investigated the quality and availability of roads, railroads, ports, air transport, electricity, and telephones. In terms of overall infrastructure, the U.S. ranks 25th, behind nations such as Oman and Barbados, and only one spot ahead of Qatar. America’s position is buoyed by finishing first in one category: the number of available airline seats.  In other words, it's easy for Americans to get a plane ticket to wherever they need to go. Other areas hold the United States’ ranking down. For instance, the quality of air transport infrastructure is ranked 30th in the world, while quality of the electricity supply ranks 33rd. China ranked lower than the U.S. in every single sub-category of infrastructure quality, and 69th overall. McKinsey
SeawayLast week, a major new oil pipeline was completed to connect processing facilities in Oklahoma with port refineries near Galveston, Texas, according to Platts. Drillers are celebrating. But many Americans will soon begin to feel some pain at the pump. Here's the situation: For years now, there's been a massive bottleneck of crude at the deposit hub in Cushing, Okla. thanks to America's domestic crude production boom. It's at Cushing that drillers send their product to be bought by refiners. (And it's where the West Texas Intermediate benchmark price gets its name.) But because of the supply glut, wholesalers have been able to bid down the price they've been paying. As a result, states with easy access to Cushing product, especially in the Midwest, have enjoyed lower prices in recent years than other states on the East and West Coasts. Those coast states must buy their oil at the worldwide Brent price. But the new pipeline, called the Seaway, now has the capacity to carry all that new crude to the coast for export. This means the bottleneck at Cushing will ease, which means less supply for people who buy at Cushing. This means...higher gas prices. By the way, analysts also expect something similar to happen if the final section of the Keystone XL Pipeline — which also runs through Cushing — gets built.

Given what the state went through during the recession, few could have predicted this (although Bill McBride did). So how'd they do it? We dug in.
After a yearlong, multi-million-dollar renovation, the red velvet ropes will once again hold back the lines outside famed New York City nightclub Marquee. The West Chelsea hotspot is scheduled to open to the public Friday with a performance by techno DJ Dubfire. The revamped space will be better-equipped for A-list DJs and musical acts, with fewer tables and a bigger dance floor. And designer Josh Held gave it an industrial-style makeover, covering the walls in recycled leather belts and using welded rebar for the handrails. Marquee officially opens this weekend, but guests at the wrap party for Martin Scorsese's "The Wolf of Wall Street" got a sneak peek when they partied there Saturday.

Macro BeatWe've seen a lot of analysts and economists present their guide to the economy and markets and 2013. But this is the best. Naufal Sanaullah is a mathematician, portfolio manager, and editor of Macrobeat, and he's put together a delicious deck on everything that's happening in the U.S. economy. In the presentation he identifies the bullish tailwinds (e.g., housing and the increasing efficacy of monetary policy) and the bearish trends (fiscal tightening, ongoing deleveraging) and what they all mean. It's truly impressive, and a must-read. Huge thanks to Naufal for letting us run the whole thing.
net_efekt / FlickrThe economic data wasn't very exciting.  However, there was a ton of company-specific news.  Meanwhile, stocks continue to sit at 5-year highs. First the scoreboard: Dow: 13,511, -23.6, -0.1 percentS&amp;P 500: 1,472, +0.2, +0.0 percentNASDAQ: 3,117, +6.7, +0.2 percent And now the top stories:
Algorithmic trading, the use of pre-programmed computer codes to place orders and execute trades, is supposed to be the fastest, smartest way to trade in today's stock market. But sometimes the "bots," as they are affectionately called, get buggy. That's what Nanex, a market research firm, has noticed is happening today. An algorithm placing orders in WPCS International Incorporated (WPCS), a communications infrastructure company, has sent/canceled 1.4 million orders since 11am when it turned on. That's a rate of 200 orders per second. That means that of all 7771 in the United States' National Market System, WPCS has had the 6th most quotes of the day and is making up 0.62% of all quote volume. Nanex says that all these quotes are coming through Chicago Board Options Exchange (there are 8 other exchanges quoting this stock). To put that in perspective, WPCS has an average volume of 25,731 over the last 3 months. Apple has an average volume of 21,451,000 over the last 3 months. So today's orders are unprecedented, as WPCS doesn't usually see that much action. And this is all stemming from one algorithm. Imagine a Roomba carpet cleaner with a bug in it, backing up and hitting the same spot on a wall over and over again. Now imagine it doing that 200 times a second. The kicker is, there have only been 9 trades executed in this stock all day. "It's just 9 trades. This stock is very inactive. Well, except for the 1.7 million canceled orders,"Â Nanex CEO Eric Hunsader told Business Insider. "The algo places a buy order atÂ  $0.47 which makes it best bid. Then it cancels - which brings CBOE's top bid back down to $0.46 and changes the best bid. 200 times a second." The best bid is the highest quoted price for a stock (in this case) offered by competing traders looking to buy or sell. "If it keeps this up, it will surpass SPY and have the highest number of quotes for all stocks," Nanex CEO Hunsader added. The SPY is the exchange traded fund (basket of stocks) that tracks the S&amp;P 500. It has an average volume of 139,652,000 over the last 3 months. Basically, this algorithm is stuck and its just spraying a lot of orders around for no reason at all. Since there are only two prices here ($0.46 and $0.47), the chart below showing this activity isn't that wild. It's just weird. From Nanex: Â  Â 
LONDON, Jan 16 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co has reached an out-of-court settlement over its lawsuit against the former boss of Bruno Iksil, the trader known as the "London Whale" for huge bets he took that cost the bank $6.2 billion, a person familiar with the matter said. Javier Martin-Artajo, who was Iksil's immediate supervisor, had been named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed at London's High Court on Oct. 22. JPMorgan said last July it was seeking to claw back pay from those people it held responsible for the losses. Details of the action against Martin-Artajo were not released. A source familiar with the lawsuit said on Wednesday the case against Martin-Artajo had now been settled. Further details were not available. JPMorgan declined to comment. Martin-Artajo's lawyer, Greg Campbell of Mishcon de Reya, declined to comment. Campbell said last year he was confident his client would be cleared of wrongdoing, noting he had never attempted to conceal the losses either directly or indirectly. JPMorgan said in July all managers in the chief investment office (CIO) with responsibility for the losses had left the bank. Martin-Artajo and the former CIO head in Europe, Achilles Macris, were among those who left, along with Iksil himself. JPMorgan on Wednesday released a detailed report on the loss from trading positions taken from London for the CIO. The trades, made with credit derivatives, became too big for the company to exit easily.

FA Insights is a daily newsletter from Business Insider that delivers the top news and commentary for financial advisors. 3 Reasons The Stock Market Rally Could Stumble (BlackRock / iShares Blog) In a new piece on BlackRock's iShares blog, Russ Koesterich writes that the current stock market rally has been fed by relief from the fiscal cliff deal, seasonal strength, and better than expected global economic data. But these three things are temporary and he expects this rally to slow in coming days or in February for three key reasons.Â  1. "Expect a good deal of headline risk coming in the next couple of months. Investors should expect continued dysfunction from Washington as lawmakers wrestle with the debt ceiling, scheduled spending cuts and the need for continuing budget resolutions. Not only are the odds of some sort of â€œgrand bargainâ€ diminishing, but the current bickering raises the possibility of another last-minute showdown and a potential debt downgrade." 2. "There is political risk coming out of Europe, with Italian elections approaching in February. Should the election fail to produce a clear result, or should the voters choose a less market-friendly government than the one currently headed by Prime Minister Mario Monti, markets would likely react negatively." 3. "There are lingering concerns about the US economy. Once we get a look at January month-end data, we will see the first clues about how higher taxes are impacting the economy. Notwithstanding some of the stronger data cited earlier, I expect the first quarter to show relatively soft economic data. In particular, Iâ€™m concerned about consumption levels weakening in January as people come to grips with smaller paychecks." Sifma Expects The SEC To Implement Fiduciary Duty For Brokers By March (The Wall Street Journal) Wall Street trade group The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (Sifma) expects the SEC to implement stricter ethical standards for brokers by March.Â Â  "Only investment advisers are currently bound by a fiduciary duty, meaning they must always act in their clients' best interests. In contrast, brokers must ensure their investment recommendations are suitable for the client, based on factors like age and risk tolerance. Â  â€¦The brokerage industry has backed the idea in principle, but has strongly opposed applying a set of rules that hinders brokers' ability to conduct business as usual."  The Greatest Investing Lesson Of The Past Five Years (CFA Institute)Â   The CFA Institute poll just under a thousand investors about their greatest investing less in the past five years. They found that nearly 60 percent of investors said, "central banks and governments will continue to bail out troubled creditors". CFA Institute Financial NewsBrief  UBS: Stocks Are In For A Rough Ride (King World News) UBS' chief technical analyst Peter Lee thinks stocks could plunge 42 percent from their current five-year highs by 2014.Â  He points to historical mean-reverting data that he says is "100 percent accurate." "Weâ€™re not done yet.Â  Everyone thinks that weâ€™re nearing the end of the bear market, or structural sideways trading market.Â  We suspect we probably have another 5 to 8 years of this.Â  No one wants to hear this call because investors have already been frustrated by the last 13 years."We have run a number of internal studies dating back to 1800, and the track record has been 100% accurate.Â  Every single time we have overextended market to the upside, we see a â€˜mean reversionâ€™ back to normal levels.Â  Again, this is 100% accurate going back to the 1800s.â€ Naufal Sanaullah's Presentation Shows What's Really Going On In The U.S. Economy (Macrobeat) Mathematician and portfolio manager Naufal Sanaullah has put together a guide to the economy and markets in 2013.Â Â  In the presentation he gives us bullish (recovering home prices, improving PMIs, central bank easing) and bearish (weak U.S. demand and credit growth, eurozone recession, central banks running out of bullets) market trends.Â  This chart shows that consumption though resilient, has been anemic as seen by its contribution to GDP.

Bickering in Washington is preventing businesses from investing in their equipment and plants, according a new report from the American Institute for Economic Research. New orders for core capital goods have been on a downward trend for nearly a year, AIER fellow Polina Vlasenko writes. AIER Credit cannot be the problem, she says. Interest rates are low and profits are high. Commercial and industrial loans continue to grow from recession lows. AIER Something else must be behind business caution... The most likely candidate is the raft of uncertainty emanating from the on-going fiscal debate in Washington. The Congressional BudgetÂ Office, for instance, predicted that tax hikes and spending cuts associated with the fiscal cliff could push the economy back into recession. Luckily, other parts of the economy are looking bullish, she says. AIER's Business-Cycle Conditions indicators (which include yield curves, stock prices and consumer spending) suggest that over the next six to 12 months the economy will continue to grow and unemployment will continue to fall.

On Friday, NBC's news show Dateline will air a two-hour special about the weird tale of John McAfee and his links to the murder of Greg Faull. What more could there be to tell? For a man who went into hiding, McAfee did his darnedest to stay in the media the whole time he was on the run, including a jaunt in the jungle accompanied by two journalists from Vice magazine. But Dateline says that its report won't simply rehash the stuff we know: a story that involves murder, drugs, sex, escape, lies, a faked capture, a pregnant woman, dead dogs, and all sorts of accusations leveled at the police, the media, and McAfee himself. Dateline's Keith Morrison is looking into the murder itself and why police wanted to question McAfee about it in the first place. Morrison will share the facts now known about Faullâ€™s death, and his parents efforts to pressure the Belize government into solving the case. That's not to say that there won't be plenty of the other stuff, too. Morrison scored an interview with McAfee's young girlfriend, Sam Venegas, who went on the lam with him, as well as an interview with McAfee himself. This won't even be the last we see of McAfee saga. Warner Bros just bought the movie rights. McAfee came to fame and fortune for inventing the antivirus software that still bears his name.

Peter Lee, UBS Chief Technical AnalystPeter Lee, UBS Chief Technical AnalystWith stocks sitting at their 5-year highs, many investors are wondering what's next. Peter Lee, Chief Technical Analyst at UBS, recently spoke with Eric King of King World News, and he offered a dire outlook. According to Lee's reading of the charts, long-term "mean-reversion" could send stocks plummeting. Currently, the mean based on Lee's "1942 trendline" values the S&amp;P 500 at 740. The S&amp;P closed yesterday at 1,472. Lee doesn't think that stocks will return to the trendline right away.  But if it does by 2014, the S&amp;P 500 would be at around 850. From KingWorldNews.com: Peter Lee: We are about to enter this convergence period, and we suspect in the second half of this year and into 2014 we will see a great deal of major movements in these financial markets.  The charts below go back to the Great Depression when we had an 85% drop in the S&amp;P....The most recent test was the March 2009 low at 666 on the S&amp;P.  At that time the trendline was up into the low 600s, at 620, 630.  So we were within striking distance during that panic.  This 1942 trendline should be somewhere in the 850 area or above by 2014 (this would represent a horrendous drop of roughly 42% on the S&amp;P)....Eric King:  “Either way we are in for one hell of a rough ride for equities.” Lee:  “We’re not done yet.  Everyone thinks that we’re nearing the end of the bear market, or structural sideways trading market.  We suspect we probably have another 5 to 8 years of this.  No one wants to hear this call because investors have already been frustrated by the last 13 years. We have run a number of internal studies dating back to 1800, and the track record has been 100% accurate.  Every single time we have overextended market to the upside, we see a ‘mean reversion’ back to normal levels.  Again, this is 100% accurate going back to the 1800s.” Here's Lee's chart via King World News: UBS via King World News Read more at KingWorldNews.com.
UPDATE: The Fed's Beige Book is out. Regional Federal Reserve banks report "modest or moderate" economic growth, and the manufacturing outlook remained generally optimistic. Furthermore, all districts that reported on home prices saw price increases. Click here to refresh for updates &gt; Below is the full text: Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicated that economic activity has expanded since the previous Beige Book report, with all twelve Districts characterizing the pace of growth as either modest or moderate. Since the previous Beige Book, activity in the New York and Philadelphia Districts rebounded from the immediate impacts of Hurricane Sandy. Growth in the Boston, Richmond, and Atlanta Districts appears to have increased slightly, while the St. Louis District reports some slowing. All twelve districts reported some growth in consumer spending. Overall, holiday sales were reported as being modestly higher than in 2011, though sales were below expectations for contacts in many of the Districts. Auto sales were reported as steady or stronger in ten Districts. Citing concerns that consumers will spend cautiously due to ongoing fiscal uncertainty, retail contacts and auto dealers reported a slightly dimmer, though positive, outlook for future sales. Tourism activity was reported to have increased across much of the nation due to strong business and international travel, early snowfall in some ski areas, and a rebound in areas disrupted by Hurricane Sandy. Activity among nonfinancial service sectors improved overall. Firms within the six Districts reporting on transportation services generally noted increased volumes. Manufacturing was mixed overall since the previous Beige Book; six Districts reported an expansion of activity and three reported a decrease. Among Districts reporting on their firms' near-term expectations, the manufacturing outlook remained generally optimistic; however, capital spending plans were less uniformly positive. Since the previous Beige Book, real estate activity has expanded or held steady in eleven Districts for existing home sales and leasing; eight Districts for residential construction; eleven Districts for nonresidential sales and leasing; and nine Districts for nonresidential construction. Overall loan demand was steady in five Districts, rose in four, and fell in one. Credit standards were largely unchanged, except in two Districts where there were some signs of loosening. Six Districts reported improving credit quality and/or falling delinquency rates. Although rain partially eased drought conditions for some agricultural regions in three Districts, reports of agricultural activity remained mixed. Districts reported that energy and mining sector activity was steady at high levels for most energy-related products but significantly weaker in coal production and coal-related investments. Trends in wages, prices, and employment conditions were relatively unchanged in the Federal Reserve Districts. Input price pressures were reported to be steady overall with mixed reports for specific commodity prices in various Districts. Employment conditions were also little changed since the last report. However, hiring plans were more cautious for firms doing business in Europe or in the defense sector. Wage pressures were stable in all twelve Districts, though several Districts cited greater pressures for firms that reported difficulties finding qualified workers with specific skills. Consumer Spending and TourismSince the previous Beige Book, consumer spending increased to some degree in all twelve Districts. Across the nation, holiday sales grew modestly compared with last year but came in below expectations in the New York, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts. Boston reported continued strong demand for clothing, shoes, and furniture, and San Francisco reported robust online sales. A major retail chain in New York indicated that sales picked up in early January. Retail sales were flat in Richmond except for gains in food and auto sales. Expectations for future sales were positive but mild, particularly in Philadelphia, Kansas City, and Dallas where contacts cited the impact of fiscal cliff uncertainty on consumer spending. Reports of auto sales were steady to stronger in ten Districts. Richmond, Atlanta, and San Francisco noted strong sales. New York and Dallas cited mixed sales that were generally positive, while auto sales in Kansas City slowed but remained higher than a year ago. Some dealers in the Chicago and Kansas City Districts reported high levels of inventory. Contacts in Philadelphia, Cleveland, Kansas City, and Dallas expect consumers to react to ongoing fiscal uncertainty, thus dimming a positive outlook for future sales. Chicago auto dealers were more upbeat, expecting stronger new car sales due to pent-up consumer demand, easing credit conditions, and rising used vehicle prices. Tourism held steady or grew in all but one of eight reporting Districts. Coastal activity had fallen in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Sandy throughout most of the New York and Philadelphia Districts but has rebounded in all but the hardest hit areas. Boston, Atlanta, and San Francisco reported strong tourism in their Districts, with Boston and Atlanta citing business and international travel as strong contributors. Winter tourism activity in the Minneapolis District was strong in areas with snow, while Richmond reported normal winter activity in its District. Nonfinancial ServicesOverall, nonfinancial services have grown modestly since the previous Beige Book. Businesses in the New York and Philadelphia Districts recovered from the disruption of Hurricane Sandy. The Boston, Minneapolis, and San Francisco Districts reported positive growth among various service sectors, while the Richmond District reported stable to stronger demand for service firms. Boston reported strong demand for some health-care IT services and drug impact research, while San Francisco noted relatively weak demand for health-care services. Staffing firms in the Dallas District reported steady to slightly softened demand. Respondents remained optimistic about growth over the near-term in the Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts. Transportation services were generally positive among the six Districts that reported. Freight transport shipping volume improved in the Cleveland District due to rising demand from the retail sector and areas affected by Hurricane Sandy. Atlanta reported increases in trucking tonnage and total railroad carloads, but low river levels caused delays in Mississippi River traffic. Reports from transportation services in the Dallas District were mixed, and most firms expect weak growth in the near-term. Trucking firms in the Richmond District reported a flattening in revenues; however, the District's port activity was boosted by ships diverted by Hurricane Sandy. ManufacturingReports of manufacturing activity were mixed overall, with six Districts growing since the last Beige Book, three Distracts contracting, and two Districts reporting little or no change. Firms in the Boston and Chicago Districts reported continued expansion of activity at modest and moderate rates of growth, respectively. Overall activity once again appeared to expand in the San Francisco District, although it was mixed across sectors.  Gains in the aerospace and chemical sectors contributed to growth in the Boston and San Francisco Districts, as well as in the Dallas District. Manufacturing in the Chicago District grew with contributions from the auto and housing-related sectors. Manufacturing continued to expand, but at a more modest pace, in the Richmond District. Several firms cited falling export demand, especially from Europe. In contrast to slight declines in the past Beige Book, firms in the Philadelphia and Minneapolis Districts reported slightly increased manufacturing activity. As in other Districts, product flowing into supply channels for auto production and housing construction contributed to Philadelphia's gains. Prior trends continued as firms in the New York District experienced little or no growth, except for the revenues of firms in the New York City area that recovered after Hurricane Sandy disruptions. Reports continued to be mixed among sectors in the Dallas District.  Manufacturing activity within the Cleveland and Atlanta Districts, and reported plans in the St. Louis District, declined somewhat--a trend reversal from the prior Beige Book. Contributing to the declines were steel and auto producers in Cleveland and makers of HVAC equipment, electric components, food, and automobile parts in St. Louis. Despite production gains in electrical equipment, appliances, and components, more pronounced contractions within the broad nondurable goods sector led to a continuation of declining activity in the Kansas City District. Manufacturing firms' expectations of future activity were generally optimistic in the New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts; the level of optimism has significantly increased in the Philadelphia and Atlanta Districts since the previous Beige Book. Contacts in the Chicago District expect vehicle production to expand in 2013, while reports of activity from manufacturers in the St. Louis District have been negative on net. Boston District firms reported that capital spending was slow, except for select growth sectors. Capital spending was on track in the Cleveland District and was slowly increasing in the Chicago District. Looking ahead, Philadelphia District firms have significantly increased their capital spending plans, while the outlook in the Minneapolis District was reported as flat. In the Cleveland District, more contacts plan to reduce outlays than expand capacity. Real Estate and ConstructionExisting residential real estate activity expanded in all Districts that reported; growth rates were described as moderate or strong in nine Districts. Contacts in the Boston District attributed their strong sales growth to low interest rates, affordable prices, and rising rents. All Districts reporting on price levels saw increases; New York and Chicago reported only very minor increases. The five Districts that reported on housing inventories all reported falling levels. New residential construction (including repairs) expanded in all but one District of those Districts that reported. Contacts in the Kansas City District reported that increased lumber and drywall costs limited construction, causing a slight decline this period. Hurricane Sandy disrupted construction activity initially in New York, but this has since led to increased work for subcontractors on repairs and reconstruction. Though a little weaker than residential real estate, reports on sales and leasing of nonresidential real estate are still mostly positive--described as modest on average. The Boston District reported a drop in leasing beyond normal seasonal trends; contacts cited fiscal cliff uncertainty as a factor. Minneapolis and Kansas City reported increased demand and tightening commercial real estate markets. Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Dallas all reported more modest increases in nonresidential real estate activity. Nonresidential construction is weaker than residential, with only slight to modest growth. The Boston District reported that demand for commercial real estate loans appears to be softening and that the pipeline for new construction projects has diminished significantly since the last report. Dallas reported that construction was expected to pick up in the commercial real estate sector in 2013. Banking and FinanceOverall, loan demand was largely unchanged in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts, with most of these Districts reporting a continuation of slight to moderate growth in total volume. The New York, Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas Districts reported stronger demand than previously, while the St. Louis District reported a slight decline. Some increased lending in Philadelphia, Chicago, and Dallas was driven by businesses taking out loans for special year-end purposes such as tax planning and dividend payments. Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco all reported strong auto lending. Demand for residential mortgages improved in Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. Commercial real estate lending was cited as a particular bright spot by New York, Cleveland, Kansas City, and Dallas. However, lenders in San Francisco remained reluctant to lend to real estate investors outside of the multifamily residential sector. San Francisco also reported a slight slowdown in IPO, venture capital, and private equity activity in that District's technology sector. Banks in the New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts reported improvements in asset quality. Lenders were described as competing aggressively for highly qualified borrowers in Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, and San Francisco. In Atlanta, this stiff competition may be leading to loosening credit standards, as there was some indication that banks were more willing to increase their tolerance for risk. Chicago banks also reported some loosening of standards. On the other hand, lending standards remained largely unchanged in New York, Cleveland, and Kansas City. Agriculture and Natural ResourcesReports of agricultural activity were mixed, although rain and mild temperatures delivered some relief from drought conditions to parts of the Richmond, Atlanta, and Chicago Districts. Low water levels along the Mississippi River also hampered transport for some contacts in the Chicago and Kansas City Districts. Despite the drought, some contacts in these Districts reported that farm income remained high with adequate crop insurance and historically high prices. Producers in the Kansas City and Dallas Districts expect ongoing dry conditions to hurt the winter wheat crop. Activity in the energy sector had mixed reports. Production of oil and natural gas held steady at high--sometimes record--levels in the Cleveland, Richmond, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts. San Francisco reported that activity expanded to historic levels. Contacts in the Cleveland District reported that shale gas activity grew at a robust pace. In contrast, coal production has declined in the Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City Districts since the previous Beige Book. Firms in the Atlanta District continue to plan investments, ranging from reserve development to increased refining and petrochemical operations to new pipeline infrastructure. Employment, Wages, and PricesLabor market conditions remained mostly unchanged in all Districts. The Boston, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts all reported delayed hiring, often in defense manufacturing, due to fiscal cliff uncertainties. Companies in the Chicago District with trade or investment exposures to Europe reduced their hiring plans as well. Chicago reported that manufacturers are choosing to cut hours instead of reducing head count in expectation of production rebounds in 2013. Atlanta and Kansas City cited health-care policy changes and costs as another cause for minimal hiring. On the other hand, the New York, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts saw the labor market firming modestly. Finally, contacts in several Districts reported difficulties finding qualified workers in some specialized fields, such as skilled manufacturing, energy, and IT. For those Districts that reported, wage pressures have been stable since the previous Beige Book and were most frequently described as contained or subdued. The San Francisco District reported modest wage pressures that were held down by an abundance of workers. The Richmond, Chicago, and Minneapolis Districts characterized wage growth as moderate. Specifically, business contacts in the Minneapolis District expected to increase wages 2 to 3 percent in 2013, while oil drilling companies in North Dakota and Montana expected higher increases. Several Districts reported wage pressures in sectors experiencing labor shortages, such as energy and IT. The New York and Chicago Districts reported higher year-end bonuses ahead of anticipated tax increases in 2013. Overall, input price pressures appear to be stable. The Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Minneapolis, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts reported steady input prices, while Chicago reported decreasing raw materials prices. The New York, Atlanta, and Kansas City Districts characterized input prices as slightly increasing; price pressures in these Districts were passed through to consumers somewhat in the form of higher finished goods prices. However, Chicago noted that businesses were unable to fully pass on meat and milk price increases to consumers. The Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts all cited rising prices for construction-related materials. Specifically, a Philadelphia builder noted that over the past 90 days these rising prices added about 3 percent to the cost of a new home. First District--Boston Retail and TourismOne contact reports a small single-digit year-over-year decrease in December sales while the others cite increases ranging from near zero to 7 percent. Demand remains strong for clothing, shoes, and furniture. Responding retail firms expect to hold their selling prices steady based on an absence of price increases at the wholesale level. These contacts anticipate that 2013 will be characterized by low single-digit growth in sales. The tourism industry ended 2012:Q4 on a high note, establishing new records for hotel room occupancy rates and revenues. Strong domestic and international corporate business travel and international leisure travel account for much of this performance. Restaurants saw less spending on corporate entertaining and end-of-year holiday events. Advance hotel booking data indicate that the strong trend in business travel will continue, leading to an expectation that occupancy rates will hold level in 2013 compared to the high benchmark established in 2012. Manufacturing and Related ServicesManufacturing in New England continues to expand at a modest pace according to First District contacts. Of 11 responding firms, seven report higher sales in the fourth quarter than in the same period a year earlier, although in some cases the gains are quite modest. Two contacts in the semiconductor industry continue to report a cyclical downturn in their business. A contact in aerospace says that sales of parts for new airplanes are extremely strong but depressed conditions in the aftermarket have spread from the United States to Europe. A contact in the chemical industry says that while sales in pounds fell, the pricing picture improved so much that sales in dollars are up. Sales of frozen fish continue to be weak. The "fiscal cliff" was an explicit problem for a computer firm that sells almost exclusively to Defense Department customers who are worried about sequestration. Only five of the 11 respondents report significant hiring. Firms with rapidly growing sales are hiring, but firms in slow-growth industries are not. A biotech firm with 3,500 U.S. employees plans to add another 1,000 over the coming year, about half domestically. The computer supplier with customers dependent on defense spending cut its staffing by 10 percent to 15 percent over the period from June to September. A contact in the chemical industry reports both good and bad news about the labor market. On one hand, he says that for the first time since the crisis began, workers are voluntarily leaving to take new jobs. The bad news is that he is having great difficulty filling low-skill jobs. He says that drug test fails are much more common than in the past; in addition, a large number of workers quit almost immediately after taking the job. The contact speculates that both of these hiring problems may result from behaviors developed during extended periods of unemployment. As with employment, capital spending is generally slow except for firms in growth industries, with four firms reporting increases and four reporting decreases in spending. One diversified manufacturer of parts for the aerospace and auto industries reports that business units within the firm failed to spend their planned capex allocations in 2012. The outlook continues to be uncertain for most of our contacts. Only one firm, the defense supplier, cites the fiscal cliff as a serious problem and even they expect some resolution in the new year. Selected Business ServicesConsulting and advertising contacts in the First District report generally positive results for the fourth quarter. Several contacts report modest growth, while two contacts--whose firms have experienced rapid growth over the past two years--experienced a leveling off. Marketing and advertising contacts report a slight uptick during the fourth quarter and are confident that business conditions have finally stabilized after the recession, which hit them with a lag. Two contacts with exposure to health care note robust demand for services related to health-care IT implementation and drug-impacts research. At the same time, firms focused on the pharmaceutical industry have experienced slow growth, although one contact expects that pharmaceuticals will start to emerge from its rough spell in 2013. Economic consulting remains strong because of high levels of complex high-stakes litigation; management and strategy consulting contacts report flat business conditions as clients uncertain about fiscal policy and the macroeconomy remain reluctant to invest in consulting services. Contacts report little to no cost increases and are keeping their prices relatively unchanged. One exception is an advertising firm where health insurance costs rose 12 percent in 2012. Some contacts report no hiring, consistent with a lack of demand growth, while others report net hiring in the low single digits. Plans for future hiring are modest, with contacts generally expecting zero to low single-digit workforce increases in 2013. Most contacts expect growth to pick up in 2013, with the exception of a government contractor, who is too uncertain about the future of fiscal policy to offer any forecast. No one expects another recession and overall they express a sense of cautious optimism. Commercial Real EstateAcross most of the First District, leasing activity in the final weeks of 2012 is described as very light, driven by a combination of seasonal factors and uncertainty stemming from fiscal cliff negotiations. However, a Portland contact notes an uptick in leasing activity in that city in December, especially in the warehouse sector, although office fundamentals remain flat amid slow employment growth. Boston's warehouse market improved as well, while the city's office vacancy rate remains high--also attributed to slow employment growth--and the trend toward office downsizing persists. In Hartford, the fate of large downtown properties that experienced foreclosure in 2012 remains uncertain; a key question is whether current owners will reinvest in the properties or resell them as is. Demand for commercial real estate loans in the region appears to be softening, while the pipeline of new construction projects in Boston has diminished significantly since the last report. Most contacts in the region are cautiously optimistic that commercial real estate fundamentals will improve in 2013. However, growth expectations remain very modest and some contacts note downside risks to growth from pending fiscal contraction and ongoing political uncertainty, even taking into account the recently-enacted federal tax deal. Residential Real EstateAcross the First District, contacts report strong year-over-year growth in sales for November in both single-family home and condominium markets. Similar to previous reports, contacts attribute continued growth in sales to low interest rates, affordable prices, and rising rents. Contacts say that buyers have become more confident about purchasing a home as economic conditions continue to improve. As buyer activity increased, inventory levels fell throughout the region. Contacts argue that declining inventory levels have now translated into higher prices in most areas. The median sale price of homes rose year-over-year across the First District, with some states experiencing significant increases. In terms of outlooks for the coming year, contacts continue to feel positive about improvements in home values and strong sales. Significant year-over-year growth in sales is expected for the most of 2013, although a warm winter last year coupled with a potentially harsher winter this year may soften year-over-year growth in the coming months. In Massachusetts and the Greater Boston area, contacts express concern that dwindling inventory levels will discourage buyers and even potentially deter some sellers who would like to purchase a replacement home before listing their current one; at the same time, they express worry about prices appreciating too quickly, but say they are not concerned with ongoing moderate price appreciation. Notwithstanding these potential concerns, contacts across the region are generally very optimistic about the strength of the housing market in 2013. Second District--New York Consumer SpendingHoliday season sales were up modestly from last year but came in slightly below plan. A trade association survey of retailers across New York State indicates that sales were disappointing in the days leading up to Christmas as well as in the days after. A major retail chain indicates that sales were below plan in November and December but picked up fairly dramatically in early January. Retail contacts in upstate New York report that sales were flat to up compared to a year earlier. Retailers attribute the weaker than expected holiday sales to a combination of online shopping, mild weather, fiscal cliff concerns, and, in some parts of the region, slow insurance payouts to those affected by Sandy.  Retail prices were reported to be steady or up moderately. Buffalo-area auto dealers indicate that vehicle sales picked up in November but were expected to be flat to slightly lower than a year earlier in December. However, Rochester-area dealers report strong sales for both months to end 2012. Tourism activity slumped in the immediate aftermath of Sandy. Even hotels in the Albany area were reportedly affected by the storm, as widespread meeting and conference cancellations pushed down hotel occupancy rates in November. In New York City, Broadway theaters report that attendance and revenues rebounded after a deep post-Sandy slump in the first half of November. Still, December attendance was down 5 to10 percent from a year earlier, while revenues were little changed. Finally, consumer confidence in the region weakened at year end. The Conference Board's survey of residents of the Middle Atlantic states (NY, NJ, Pa) showed confidence falling to its lowest level in more than a year, while Siena College's survey of New York State residents indicated a modest decline. Construction and Real EstateResidential real estate markets in the District were generally steady since the last report, with the storm having little discernible effect on the overall market. New York City's rental market appears to have lost some momentum during the final two months of 2012, as rents in Manhattan and Brooklyn retreated and were up only slightly from a year earlier. The inventory of available rental apartments, however, remained low in late 2012. Apartment sales activity in New York City was robust in the fourth quarter--particularly in Manhattan. A major appraisal firm attributes some of the high sales volume to looming tax changes and notes that there has been a flood of appraisal requests for tax-related financial planning. Prices are reported to be flat to up slightly. In contrast, an overhang of inventory has kept prices from rising in northern New Jersey and Long Island. Sandy disrupted construction activity in late 2012, though a contact in the homebuilding industry notes that construction sub-contractors are getting a great deal of work from storm-related repairs and reconstruction during a typically slow season. Office markets were relatively stable in the final months of 2012. A commercial real estate contact reports that the recovery from Sandy in Lower Manhattan has been slow, as a number of buildings in the flood zone remained out of service at year end. More broadly, leasing and sales activity across Manhattan were sluggish in November but picked up in December. Vacancy rates have been steady, while asking rents have edged up, led by brisk gains in Midtown South. Strong demand from the new media and advertising sectors and some pickup from legal services have offset weak demand from the financial sector. Elsewhere in the region, vacancy rates were little changed in the fourth quarter, though asking rents fell noticeably in northern New Jersey. Other Business ActivityContacts in the manufacturing sector continue to report little or no growth in activity though they remain mildly optimistic about the near-term outlook. Non-manufacturing contacts report some improvement in business conditions and have grown increasingly optimistic about prospects for 2013. New York City area firms--both manufacturing firms  and non-manufacturing firms--say that Sandy adversely affected revenues in November but that business was seen to be back on track in December. On balance, labor market conditions firmed in late 2012. While business contacts in the manufacturing sector report little or no change in employment, contacts in other sectors note some pickup in hiring. A major New York City employment agency specializing in office jobs said that while it is difficult to assess the labor market during the holiday season some continued softness in labor market conditions is apparent. In particular, financial sector hiring has remained sluggish, but year-end bonuses are expected to be up moderately from a year ago. Much of the bonus pay typically distributed in January was reportedly paid out in December in advance of higher tax rates. Financial DevelopmentsSmall- to medium-sized banks report no change in demand for all loan types except commercial mortgages, where loan demand increased. Bankers report little change in demand for refinancing. The vast majority of respondents continue to report that credit standards were unchanged across all categories. Respondents indicate a decrease in spreads of loan rates over the costs of funds for all loan categories--particularly in residential mortgages, where nearly three in five bankers report lower spreads. Respondents also indicate a decrease in average deposit rates, on balance. Finally, bankers note declining delinquency rates in all loan categories--most notably in commercial mortgages, where well over half of those surveyed report lower delinquencies. Third District--Philadelphia The overall outlook for at least modest growth is considerably more optimistic relative to the views expressed in the last Beige Book. Contacts reported underlying strength in many sectors and expressed relief that part of the fiscal cliff dilemma has been resolved. Contacts from virtually all sectors reported greater expectations of future growth than during our last survey period. Plans for future hiring were also significantly more expansive. Most contacts continued to express concerns over the impact from the recent payroll tax increase and the remaining potential budget cuts that might reduce demand. ManufacturingSince the last Beige Book, Third District manufacturers have reported that orders and shipments have recovered to a pace of slight growth. The mild pace can be partially attributed to seasonal trends. Comments from contacts focused primarily on small upticks, new product demand, and emerging markets, rather than on disappointing orders. Makers of food products, lumber and wood products, primary metals, fabricated metal products, and instruments have reported gains since the last Beige Book. Lower activity was reported by makers of industrial machinery and electronic equipment. Optimism among Third District manufacturers that business conditions will improve during the next six months has rebounded strongly since the last Beige Book and is evident across nearly all sectors. Firms have also significantly raised their overall expectations of future hiring and their plans for capital spending since the last Beige Book. RetailThird District retail sales recovered to a modest pace of growth for the holiday shopping season after the disruptions of Hurricane Sandy, according to retail contacts. Sales reports were mixed for mid-market department stores and some home furnishing stores, which reported moderate early holiday sales gains followed by a lull, with slight declines from the prior year. High-end department stores, family apparel stores, and outlet stores reported modest or moderate year-over-year sales throughout the holiday period. Some substantial mall tenants posted strong double-digit sales growth. Until final sales are tallied, retail contacts relied on other early indicators to suggest that the final days of the holiday shopping season had grown modestly, or better. Traditional mall retailers continued to draw shoppers with promotions, while outlet stores used fewer promotions than in prior years. Shopper surveys revealed concern over the consumers' future paychecks from the pending fiscal cliff negotiations. Auto sales finished the year at a moderate pace of growth--combining the sector's slower pre-storm pace with a bump up for replacement of cars damaged by the storm. In particular, New Jersey dealers reported strong double-digit December sales, capping a third consecutive year of sales growth. The outlook among dealers remains positive; however, prospects for 2013 are not as strong as they were for 2012. "Consumers will feel a pinch" from the payroll tax increase and continued uncertainty about possible budget cuts. FinanceOverall, loan volumes have continued to grow at a slight pace across Third District financial firms since the previous Beige Book. A flurry of year-end business lending kept banks busy facilitating tax-oriented business decisions involving sales and liquidations, mergers and acquisitions, accelerated depreciation, and dividend payouts. Home mortgage refinancing rates continued to remain high. In describing their competition as very aggressive, lenders expressed awareness of some potential portfolio risk, even while the credit quality of their borrowers continued to improve. Generally, financial institutions are expecting growth to continue, if not improve.   Real Estate and ConstructionResidential builders reported one final surge of contract activity in November and then a downswing in December to conclude with slight year-over-year growth for the period. Despite facing erratic swings in demand through the year, our contacts reported very strong year-over-year growth for the entire year, which is more indicative of their own gains in market share than of the sector overall. Residential brokers reported robust year-over-year sales growth in November, with steady year-end momentum. As with new home construction, existing home sales are growing from a low base. Builders and, to a greater extent, brokers are optimistic that recent growth will be sustained in 2013. As with other sectors, contacts expressed concern that the fiscal cliff negotiations had been extended into their important first quarter. Nonresidential real estate contacts reported renewed modest growth in overall leasing activity and continued slight growth in construction. Leasing activity finished the year with sustained double-digit growth. Notably, in the fourth quarter, contacts began "to see a re-emergence of leasing demand in lagging submarkets" (in the Greater Philadelphia metro area), including southern New Jersey. Stronger employment growth of professional services is credited with much of the demand; however, that demand is partially offset, as existing firms are consolidating and adjusting to more efficient overall office spaces with smaller square footage per person. New construction of large industrial/warehouse space is planned in 2013 in the Harrisburg–Lehigh Valley corridor on the heels of similar spaces built this year; no such construction is anticipated in the southern New Jersey market area. New apartment/condominium projects continue to emerge throughout the Greater Philadelphia region, especially in Center City. Nonresidential real estate contacts retain an outlook of slow, steady growth. ServicesThird District service-sector firms have resumed a more modest pace of growth since the last Beige Book, according to contacts in various sectors. Tourist areas along the Delaware and New Jersey shores are in various stages of recovery from Hurricane Sandy. Atlantic City casinos reported significantly lower revenues in November (as much as $55 million) compared with 2011. Businesses and rental housing that serve the central and northern Jersey Shore communities continued to lose some of the money they would have earned in the low season. Southern New Jersey and Delaware beach communities are largely intact and operating normally. A Delaware beach hotel owner reported a strong December finish to the year, which was partly due to an extra holiday weekend. District staffing firms reported a mild pace of growth at year's end – an improvement after the storm disruptions. Staffing contacts expect moderate growth in 2013 but are watching their clients' reactions to the serial fiscal cliff decisions. Defense-related firms received no relief from the uncertainty of budget cuts that has held their business plans in stasis for the past year. Overall, service-sector firms expressed more confidence in their expectations for growth in the near future. Prices and WagesOverall, price levels continued to increase slightly, similar to the previous Beige Book. Cost factors among manufacturing firms held steady, while the prices they received rose a little. Tighter auto inventories generate a price environment that favors auto dealers over their customers. Homebuilders noted that rising commodity prices had added about 3 percent to the cost of a new home in the past 90 days. In addition, roofing and siding contractors have lost crews to the Jersey Shore repairs. Real estate contacts continued to report that house prices are firming up and that houses in some markets are receiving multiple offers. Rents are rising in most segments of the Philadelphia central business district market and for industrial space along the corridor from Carlisle, PA, to the Lehigh Valley. In other segments and geographies, rents are flat or still falling. Contacts from all sectors continued to report that wages rose only a little, if at all. After a good year, two homebuilders reported issuing the first pay raises to their staffs in several years. Contacts did report strong growth in unemployment compensation and workers' compensation costs. Fourth District--Cleveland Hiring was sluggish across industry sectors. Staffing-firm representatives saw little change in the number of job openings and placements during the past six weeks. Vacancies were found primarily in manufacturing and healthcare. Wage pressures are contained. Input prices were stable, apart from increases in construction materials. ManufacturingReports from District factories indicated that new orders and production were flat or down slightly during the past six weeks. Companies seeing increases were largely suppliers to the motor vehicle and energy industries. Compared to a year ago, production activity was mixed. Steel producers and service centers described shipping volume as lower relative to levels seen in the third quarter. Many of our contacts expect a slight weakening in business activity during the next few months due to seasonal factors and uncertainty surrounding the outcome of fiscal policy issues. Auto production at District plants showed a moderate decline during November on a month-over-month basis. Relative to prior year levels, production was largely higher, especially for foreign nameplates. Inventories are being reduced to become more aligned with demand. Manufacturers noted that capacity utilization has fallen in recent weeks; however, rates were within or slightly below their normal range. Capital spending was largely on track for 2012. About one-third of our contacts plan on cutting back capital outlays during this year, and few producers anticipate expanding capacity. Raw material prices were either flat or trended lower, while finished goods prices held steady. On balance, manufacturing payrolls were little changed. Less than half of our contacts expect to hire new workers during 2013. Wage pressures are contained, and rising health insurance premiums remain a challenge. Real EstateHome builders reported that the upturn in sales of new single-family homes continued into December. Although a seasonal slowdown is expected, builders expressed confidence that sales will pick up again in the spring. Contracts were found mainly in the mid- to higher-price-point categories. The number of single and multi-family housing starts in December was significantly above year-ago levels. List prices of new homes are increasing, which was attributed to shrinking inventories and rising construction costs. Builders have cut back on discounting. Tight lending standards are still seen as restraining the effect of low interest rates for builders and home buyers. Multi-family developments are expected to be the driving force behind new housing construction during the next one to two years. Nonresidential contractors reported that business activity grew across market segments and was better than a year ago. Nonetheless, margins are still tight. Although inquiries are down, which is typical for this time of year, builders are satisfied with their backlogs going into 2013. Project financing is available, but it is very time consuming to close a deal. As a result, some developers are turning away from banks and looking more to private lenders. Our contacts are optimistic about near-term activity due to customers wanting to complete must-do projects, such as maintenance or production consolidation. However, there is a heightened level of uncertainly about the medium to long term. A general contractor reported that his customers are postponing the design phase of some of their projects. Other builders expect a slowing in health care construction, as providers evaluate the implementation of recently enacted laws. Residential and nonresidential builders reported higher prices for drywall and lumber, due to rising demand and a declining supply base. Contractors anticipate widespread price increases for building materials during the first quarter of 2013. General contractors and subcontractors expect to increase their payrolls at a modest pace this year. There is concern about the availability of highly skilled trade workers and back-office personnel, and the potential impact a shortage of either could have on wage pressures. Consumer SpendingReports on the holiday shopping season were generally solid. Most retailers were encouraged by results during the Thanksgiving weekend, and a majority said that sales during this holiday season were above those of a year ago. However, some contacts reported that sales figures fell below expectations for the entire season. Increased volume was seen particularly in electronics and apparel. Sales for the first quarter of the new year are expected to trend higher relative to prior-year levels. Vendor and shelf prices held steady. Capital spending remains on target. A majority of our contacts reported that they plan to increase outlays slightly during 2013, particularly for warehousing, store improvements, and e-commerce. Little new hiring is anticipated, except for staffing new stores. Year-to-date sales of new motor vehicles showed a moderate increase during November compared to the same time period a year ago. Dealers reported that purchases of fuel-efficient cars, including hybrids and compact SUVs, are doing well. New-vehicle inventories were described as adequate to strong. A seasonal slowdown in sales is expected during January and February. Several dealers cited uncertainty over the resolution of fiscal policy issues as a factor that may affect auto sales in upcoming months. Year-to-date sales of used vehicles increased slightly during November, though inventories are still tight. Leasing continued to trend slightly higher, which should help to replenish the used-vehicle inventory by mid-2013. One dealer noted that the balance between leasing and traditional financing has returned to normal. Some of our contacts reported that their employment level is lower than prior to the recession, and most do not expect to increase payrolls during the next 6 to 12 months. BankingDemand for business credit was steady or down slightly since our last report. Some contacts cited a rise in the number of applications for commercial real estate loans and refinancings, but on balance, demand was little changed across sectors and product categories. Several bankers noted that their loan-to-deposit ratio was much lower than desired. On the consumer side, reports indicated an increase in drawdowns on home equity lines of credit and rising credit card receivables, which were attributed to holiday shopping. A few bankers saw an increase in auto loans. Activity was strong in the residential mortgage market, with a large majority of applicants looking to refinance. Delinquency rates held steady or declined across consumer and commercial loan categories. Core deposits grew, with an ongoing transition from time-deposit to transaction accounts. Little change in banking payrolls is expected in the near term. EnergyConventional oil and natural gas production was stable during the past couple of months. Shale gas activity continued at a robust pace: in West Virginia, well output at the end of 2011 was up 138 percent from the prior year, and during the first six months of 2012, well output across Pennsylvania rose by 42 percent compared to the previous 6 months. In eastern Ohio, 187 wells have been drilled in the Utica shale in the past year, with 44 currently producing. Coal production for 2013 is expected to be flat relative to 2012 levels. Demand for thermal coal increased slightly due to colder weather and a slowdown in switching from coal to gas by electric utilities. Demand for metallurgical coal in the U.S. held steady, but declined from offshore customers, particularly those in Europe. Falling prices for metallurgical coal have leveled off, while steam-coal prices were mixed. Capital expenditures by conventional drillers and coal producers are expected to decline during the first six months of 2013. Production equipment and material prices were flat across most categories. Apart from shale gas companies, little hiring is anticipated during the next 6 to 12 months. Freight TransportationReports on freight transport indicate that shipping volume has improved since the start of November after an unexpected drop-off during the prior two months. Some contacts attributed the boost to rising demand coming from the retail sector and areas affected by Hurricane Sandy. Freight executives were fairly positive in their outlook for 2013, with the caveat that a resolution is reached on issues involving fiscal policy. Costs associated with truck maintenance held steady, while diesel fuel prices fell. Reports on capital spending were mixed. Some freight haulers said that 2012 expenditures reached targeted levels. Others reported a postponement in purchasing equipment for replacement and expansion due to a sluggish economy and supply issues related to Class 8 trucks. Spending in 2013 is expected to be similar to 2012 levels, and it will be mainly for replacement. Due to uncertainty about the economy, hiring plans for 2013 are tentative. Wage pressures were contained. Fifth District--Richmond ManufacturingDistrict manufacturing continued to expand, but at a more modest pace since our last report. A furniture manufacturer said that his business had improved through gains in market share and new product introductions, and that the improvement should continue in 2013. A spokesperson for the technology industry reported that 2012 was expected to be flat, but instead grew by ten to twelve percent. Another contact stated that, "Manufacturing is hanging in there," noting that niche markets were doing best, but only if they were not dependent on international demand. A producer of lumber products commented that sales volumes and orders dropped, in part because of Hurricane Sandy's impact on their customer base in the northeast. An electrical components manufacturer reported that business was "terrible," adding that his only sales were to replace ruined equipment from Hurricane Sandy, and that export orders to Europe had dropped off. According to our latest survey, raw materials prices were relatively flat, while finished goods prices rose at a slightly slower pace. PortsThe typical seasonal surge in import volumes shifted as a result of two major events. The first was the threat of an East Coast port strike that has loomed since the September 2012 expiration of the master contract between the International Longshoremen's Association and the U.S. Maritime Alliance. A number of shippers used alternative West Coast and Canadian ports ahead of the peak season to minimize disruptions to their businesses. Secondly, Hurricane Sandy caused diversions to Fifth District ports, boosting an already solid peak season. In addition, bulk fuel shipments that were diverted to the Northeast created "a pinch in supply" for companies located further south. Exports of resins for plastics, grains, forestry products and metal scrap were especially strong, with imports being led by beverages and retail goods. Both exports and imports of auto-related products were robust. RetailRetail sales flattened, with the exception of food and vehicle sales, according to most merchants contacted since our last report. Several blamed the lackluster sales on the federal government's failure to resolve its fiscal issues. Most retailers responding to a special poll indicated that they planned an equal amount of holiday discounting as a year ago. A West Virginia department store manager reported that sales were a little soft ahead of Christmas, while other retailers noted little change. In contrast, many grocers noted an uptick in revenues. Although big-ticket sales were weak overall, car sales rose by double-digit percentages in recent weeks. Federal fiscal indecision also pushed sales of heavy trucks, construction equipment, and buses at the end of 2012, ahead of the possible expiration of bonus depreciation. According to survey respondents, retail price growth slowed during the past month. ServicesServices firms reported stable to stronger demand since our last report. An executive at a national freight trucking firm indicated that revenues flattened in the District, while another trucking company reported that demand slowed slightly, although that company was able to improve its margins. Demand strengthened at telecommunications and engineering firms, and a contact in Washington, D.C. remarked that law firms see regulatory practice as a growth industry. During the week of Christmas and New Year's Day, the CDC reported that the flu had become widespread across the District. An executive at a North Carolina healthcare facility commented that the "flu season hit early and hard," more than doubling the average number of cases for that time of year. Non-retail services prices rose slightly faster in recent weeks, according to survey respondents.  Tourism activity was at normal winter levels in recent weeks, and rate changes were modest. In addition, a D.C. contact commented that restaurant bookings were brisk for holiday meals and events. An executive at a Virginia resort area said that his rentals were filled up for the week from Christmas through New Year's Day. A source on the outer banks of North Carolina reported somewhat less tourism activity, compared to a year ago because of lingering road problems caused by Hurricane Sandy. FinanceDemand for both consumer and commercial loans varied across the District. A North Carolina lender noted that mortgages for new purchases of homes declined, in part because of economic uncertainty. However, a second North Carolina lender said new financing is outpacing refinancing at his bank. According to another North Carolina banker, the home mortgage business is improving and he indicated that refinancing has strengthened in his region; in addition, a number of lenders stated that the competition among lenders for refinancing business has been aggressive. Finally, a banking contact with several locations in the District reported that demand for consumer loans and mortgages had not changed much. Bankers in Maryland and West Virginia reported that foreclosures have slowed. A West Virginia banker said that while overall credit quality has been very good, residential mortgage delinquencies have crept up slightly, and that demand for commercial credit had been steady at a relative high rate in recent weeks. Another West Virginia banker remarked that his region's commercial and industrial loan demand had slowed because economic progress has been "lumpy." A banker in North Carolina reported that loan demand from businesses had remained weak despite lower borrowing rates, owing in part to economic uncertainty. Real EstateResidential real estate activity continued to improve since our last report. A contact in South Carolina said that the real estate market was dynamic in the Charleston area and that demand and pricing were stronger than they had been in a long time. A Realtor in the Washington, D.C. area expects a strong market through early 2013, as the combination of record low inventory and low interest rates encourages new listings. A contact in West Virginia told us that home sales in his area have improved considerably and that prices were flat for the first time since the drop in values two years ago. Another source saw improvement in the "move up" market but little to no activity in the speculative market. He also remarked that the start-up market for housing remained flat and that the effect of student loans on credit scores was a cloud over the mortgage market. Reports were mixed on commercial real estate and construction markets in the District. While a few contacts reported modest improvement in activity since our last report, others noted flat activity or modest declines. A developer in the Carolinas said that absorption rates in the office sector tightened in the downtown Charlotte area, but vacancies in suburban areas remained elevated. In contrast, a real estate representative in Virginia indicated that office park absorption rates in the Roanoke suburbs were good, with ninety percent occupancy rates, which he attributed to new medical facilities. However, he noted that vacancies in the downtown area were considerably higher. Most sources also mentioned tightening of available office space, especially among Class A properties, due to lack of new construction. A Charlotte Realtor stated that leasing rates in the industrial sector continued to decline this year and noted little new development in the retail sector. Moreover, several realtors reported that rental rates were soft, noting that it was a "tenant's market." However, all contacts were in agreement that concessions were decreasing. Agriculture and Natural ResourcesAgricultural conditions remained favorable. Oil and natural gas production remained at high levels during the past six weeks. December was relatively mild across most of the District, with warmer than normal temperatures and significant precipitation. Small grain conditions improved with the added moisture, as did pastures and hayfields. Although conventional oil and natural gas production held steady at high levels, the rig count fell in West Virginia. Cushioning the fall, many companies continued to drill in order to get wells in place before permits expired. In contrast, coal production fell last year due to lower demand from domestic utilities and offshore customers, idling many mines. One coal producer attributed the depressed coal market to stricter regulations coupled with lower natural gas prices, as well as a weaker economy both in the United States and in Europe. Labor MarketsConditions in labor markets weakened since our last report. There were several reports of soft demand for workers in part because businesses were reluctant to hire in the politically uncertain climate. Retail employment dropped sharply in recent weeks, and several service sector contacts indicated that hiring decisions were in a holding pattern. Exceptions were to fill vacated positions and to ease nursing shortages, and a Washington contact remarked that restaurants were paying bonuses to attract managers. Sources continued to report difficulty finding qualified workers to fill vacancies, particularly in advanced manufacturing. Two Virginia temporary employment agencies noted increased demand for high tech and highly skilled workers. According to an ad hoc poll, less than half of the retailers who made seasonal hires expected to offer those employees a permanent position after the holidays. Wage growth in manufacturing remained moderate, even among skilled workers, while average retail wages declined. In contrast, non-retail service sector wages continued to rise at a moderate pace. Sixth District--Atlanta District merchants cited mildly positive holiday sales, while tourism contacts noted continued strength in both business and leisure travel. Residential real estate contacts experienced ongoing modest sales growth for both new and existing homes on a year-over-year basis, while commercial contacts described demand conditions as improving, especially in the multifamily segment of the market. Manufacturers, on the other hand, noted a decline in orders and production. Reports from bankers indicated that loan demand had strengthened, driven in large part by an increase in mortgage lending. Employment levels across the District expanded at a modest pace, while pricing pressures remained subdued. Consumer Spending and TourismDistrict contacts reported cautious optimism following a robust start to the holiday season. While sales were better than expected over the Thanksgiving weekend, reports covering the entire holiday season showed that total sales, although above year-ago results, did not appear to meet expectations. Deep discounting was prevalent throughout the holiday season. Auto sales remained robust and truck sales were somewhat positive with sales of replacement vehicles driving the growth for that segment. Travel and tourism contacts continued to report strong activity. Hospitality contacts noted increases in visitation and spending in the final quarter of 2012. Lower gasoline prices boosted leisure travel. Business travel and attendance at major conventions also increased. International visitors continued to lift tourism activity and advance reservations of international travel have exceeded expectations. The outlook for 2013 remained positive with hospitality contacts projecting increases in occupancy rates and revenue per available room. Real Estate and ConstructionThe majority of District residential brokers reported that recent existing home sales were ahead of year earlier levels. Sales growth was strongest in Florida. Most brokers in the region again noted declining inventories and rising home prices. Buyer traffic remained ahead of the year-ago level by most accounts. For 2013, most anticipate home sales growth will continue to improve slowly. Reports from District homebuilders were a bit more positive than in our last report. Builders reported that recent new home sales and construction activity were slightly ahead of year-earlier levels. The majority of builders continued to report that new home inventories were below the year-ago level and prices were up slightly. Buyer interest remained strong but several builders continued to note difficulty securing development and construction financing. Despite the challenges, the outlook for construction activity remained positive and builders anticipate new home sales in 2013 to exceed 2012 levels across many parts of the District. Reports from District commercial contractors indicated that the pace of construction activity improved modestly from the third to fourth quarter and was ahead of the previous year's performance. Apartment development was particularly strong. The pipeline for commercial construction at the end of the fourth quarter was greater than the year-ago level by most accounts. Most said that commercial construction development financing remained scarce. However, the outlook for 2013 remained positive as most contacts expect commercial construction activity to be slightly ahead of 2012 levels. Commercial brokers indicated that most office, industrial, and retail markets in the District experienced modestly positive absorption rates. Overall, contacts continued to anticipate steady, but slow improvements in District commercial real estate markets during 2013. Manufacturing and TransportationManufacturing contacts in the region reported that new orders and production contracted in December. Finished inventory levels also declined from the previous month. However, nearly half of manufacturing contacts expect production to be higher than current levels over the next three-to-six months, up from just under one-third in November. Trucking contacts reported a notable increase in tonnage in November, representing the first gain since July 2012, and offsetting a drop in October's readings. Reports suggested that Hurricane Sandy affected both months' readings. A large truck dealer reported it is expanding sales to include flatbed trailers in response to anticipated increased movement of construction materials as a result of improvements in the housing sector. Railroad contacts reported an increase in total carloads in November over year-ago levels with the largest increases occurring in chemicals and agricultural products while declines were noted in coal, metallic ores, and metals. Concerns grew over low river levels that have led to delays in Mississippi River barge traffic. Banking and FinanceMany banking contacts indicated loan demand had increased and they've added lending specialists to deal with current and anticipated demand. Competition for quality borrowers remained fierce and there was some indication that banks were more willing to increase their tolerance for risk. Auto lending remained active and some depository institutions noted more loan growth in November and December. Low rates encouraged mortgage activity, and purchases accounted for a larger share of mortgage loans than in the recent past. Community banks reported spending a larger portion of their income on compliance and remained concerned about increasing regulatory pressures. Employment and PricesSince the last report, payroll growth increased mildly across the District, though contacts said that uncertainty over fiscal policy and healthcare costs tempered hiring decisions. Aggregate gains in job growth across the District were fueled largely by strong job growth in Florida and Louisiana. Contacts in Florida's leisure and hospitality industry reported moderately improved hiring expectations, while the construction, retail, and energy sectors in Louisiana saw relatively healthy increases in employment in November and December. Pricing pressures remained subdued, according to results from our December Business Inflation Expectations survey which indicated that unit costs were up 1.5 percent over the past 12 months, which is down from 1.7 percent in November. Margins improved somewhat in December, especially for retail contacts who reported being able to pass on slightly higher markups compared to the holiday season in 2011. Looking forward, year-ahead unit cost expectations of businesses were 1.9 percent in December, moderating from 2.1 percent the month before. Businesses continued to cite costs relating to tax policy, regulation, and healthcare as sources of uncertainty going into 2013. Natural Resources and AgriculturePlanned investments, ranging from reserve development to increased refining and petrochemical operations to new pipeline infrastructure, continued to take place in the energy sector. For example, preparation for development of a large gas-to-liquids (GTL) and ethane cracker complex in Louisiana was announced, which is expected to increase the region's production capacity for GTL diesel and ethylene. Separately, industry contacts maintained that higher margins for natural gas liquids and other associated products continued to warrant ongoing drilling in natural gas wells, despite low prices for natural gas. In the midst of an apparent surge in investment activity in the energy industry, District contacts continued to cite a shortage of specialized skilled labor as a significant hurdle facing expansion plans going forward. Prices for corn, soybeans, beef, and poultry remained above year-ago levels, while the price for cotton was lower than this time last year. Dry conditions persisted in much of the District, although late December rains helped many areas in the region. Seventh District--Chicago Consumer SpendingConsumer spending increased somewhat from the previous reporting period. Retailers noted that holiday sales were slightly below expectations. Multiple retailers reported that store traffic volumes fluctuated more throughout the holiday season than in recent years. Apparel and jewelry sales were strong, while sales of toys and electronics were more in line with expectations, and general merchandise sales were weaker. Auto sales in the District lagged the national pace, with several dealers indicating that lower consumer confidence hurt year-end sales. Some auto dealers also noted that inventory levels were slightly high. However, dealers expected new car sales to be stronger in 2013 due to pent-up consumer demand, easing credit conditions, and rising used vehicle prices. Business SpendingGrowth in business spending remained tepid in late November and December. Inventory investment was little changed while spending on equipment and structures continued to slowly increase. Some contacts again noted a reluctance to spend given heightened uncertainty related to federal fiscal policy. Labor market conditions were unchanged. Hiring plans for the coming year were limited. Retail employment increased with some seasonal hiring, but few significant full-time post-holiday additions were expected. A recruiting firm noted that customers that are heavily dependent upon government spending were very cautious about increasing headcount amidst the fiscal cliff negotiations. Companies with exposures to Europe were likewise being more conservative in their hiring plans. However, contacts indicated that there is still strong demand for talent in technology, engineering, accounting and finance, energy, and skilled manufacturing jobs. Manufacturers indicated a reluctance to reduce headcount despite the recent slowdown in activity, choosing to cut overtime hours instead in expectation of a rebound in production in the first quarter. In addition, some contacts are also beginning to limit hours for part-time workers to less than 30 hours in order to avoid the 30-hour (full-time employee status) rule related to the Affordable Care Act. Construction and Real EstateConstruction and real estate activity was mixed in late November and December. Residential construction continued to rise. However, homebuilders noted that new construction would stay moderate in many regional markets as long as existing home prices remained well below new home prices. Existing home prices did edge up in some areas of the District, and rental rates continued to rise. In addition, contacts reported that in many cases credit for homebuyers remained tight, slowing the pace of home sales. Demand for nonresidential construction remained weak, but some improvement was noted in the light industrial and office markets. Several commercial real estate contacts observed that uncertainty surrounding federal fiscal policy continues to weigh on structures spending in a number of market segments. However, commercial real estate conditions improved slightly. Vacancy rates continued to decrease; and while the pace of leasing and acquisition deals remained slow, it picked up slightly as financing became easier to obtain. ManufacturingGrowth in manufacturing production continued to be moderate over the reporting period. Capacity utilization in the steel industry increased slightly and service center inventories were noted to be at desirable levels. Specialty metal manufacturers reported a decline in quoting and new orders as customers continued to delay purchases until the last minute. In contrast, a contact in the defense industry noted a substantial rebound in orders due to the two-month delay in sequestration. Contacts noted a slight pick-up in demand for construction equipment due to improvement in the housing market, although demand from the public sector remained weak. The auto industry remained a source of strength for manufacturing. Auto suppliers reported strong orders through the end of the year, and many expected vehicle production to expand in 2013. Activity in the energy industry appeared to slow. The lower price of natural gas, in part due to abundant supply, has negatively affected coal mining. In addition, one contact noted the lower prices had also led to a pause in shale gas production. However, contacts expected activity in the energy industry to rebound in early 2013. Banking and FinanceCredit conditions continued to gradually ease over the reporting period. Credit spreads and financial market volatility remained low, and asset quality continued to improve. Credit line utilization rose substantially, with contacts citing end-of-year factors such as tax planning and special dividends as reasons for the increase. Banking contacts also reported moderate growth in demand for small business loans, particularly from manufacturing industries such as machining and packaging. Pricing for business loans changed little, while contacts cited some loosening of loan standards. Consumer loan demand, particularly for mortgage and auto loans, continued to increase. Contacts indicated, however, that less home refinancing activity was being processed than in the previous reporting period. Prices and CostsCost pressures eased in late November and December. Most raw material prices moved lower, although there was some pressure on lumber and drywall prices and concerns remained around potential food and energy price increases. In contrast, manufacturers supplying the defense industry said their customers were attempting to negotiate large price decreases; these contacts thought they could instead secure multi-year price agreements in exchange for more moderate price reductions. A contact in the grocery industry indicated that they have been unable to fully pass on recent meat and milk cost increases. More generally, retailers reported that discounting and promotions increased over the holiday shopping season. Wage pressures remained moderate, but nonwage costs increased. Contacts again cited higher healthcare costs; however, a few noted that increases this year were less pronounced than a year ago. Several contacts also reported increasing 401(k) payouts and year-end bonuses. AgricultureAlthough drought conditions eased, depleted soil moisture remained a concern in much of the District. The low levels of the Mississippi River hampered barge traffic moving both crops to market and inputs to farms. Crop operations tended to come out ahead for the year if they had adequate insurance coverage, and most crop farmers saw their net worth grow. Uncertainty regarding the tax treatment of capital expenditures led farmers to move up purchases of equipment and other capital improvements into 2012. Corn and soybean prices slid during the reporting period. Milk prices decreased, while cattle and hog prices increased. Of these agricultural products, only hog prices were below the levels of a year ago. Farmland values trended higher, with an extra spurt of farm sales at the end of 2012 in anticipation of tax code changes. Cash rents for cropland increased as well for the upcoming season. Eighth District--St. Louis Manufacturing and Other Business ActivityReports of plans for manufacturing activity have been negative on net since our previous report. Several manufacturing firms reported plans to lay off workers and close plants in the Eighth District, while fewer manufacturing firms reported plans to hire new workers or expand operations. Firms in HVAC equipment, electric components, food, and automobile parts manufacturing reported plans to lay off workers. In contrast, firms that manufacture small arms and medical devices reported plans to hire new workers and expand operations. Reports of planned activity in the District's service sector have been positive since our previous report. Firms in electric power generation, food services, business support services, and information services announced plans to hire new employees and construct new facilities. In contrast, firms in medical services and in financial services reported plans to lay off workers. Retail contacts in Louisville reported the opening of several new facilities, and an auto dealer group is expanding operations in the Memphis area. Retailers in Memphis reported increased sales on an annual basis, and auto dealers in Little Rock and Louisville also reported increased sales for the year. Real Estate and ConstructionHome sales increased throughout most of the Eighth District on a year-over-year basis. Compared with the same period in 2011, November 2012 year-to-date home sales were up 16 percent in Louisville, 5 percent in Little Rock, 13 percent in Memphis, and 19 percent in St. Louis. Residential construction increased in the majority of the District. November 2012 year-to-date single-family housing permits increased in the majority of the District's metropolitan areas compared with the same period in 2011. Permits increased 40 percent in Louisville, 26 percent in Little Rock, 30 percent in Memphis, and 25 percent in St. Louis. Commercial and industrial real estate market conditions have improved in some areas of the District. Contacts in the Memphis metropolitan area noted that commercial and industrial real estate activity remained stable. A contact in St. Louis noted that office space leasing activity improved in the downtown area, while a contact in Louisville noted strong suburban office space leasing activity. Commercial and industrial construction activity continued to improve throughout most of the District. Contacts in Louisville noted plans for speculative industrial construction in Jefferson County, Indiana, and several industrial construction projects in southern Indiana and in Bullitt County, Kentucky. A contact in Little Rock reported new commercial construction projects in southwest Little Rock. Contacts in Memphis reported a number of ongoing health care construction projects in the downtown area. A contact in St. Louis reported commercial construction plans in the Dogtown neighborhood and that an automobile assembly plant expansion is under construction in Wentzville. Banking and FinanceTotal loans outstanding at a sample of small and mid-sized District banks decreased 0.6 percent from early September to mid-December. Real estate lending, accounting for 72.4 percent of total loans, was little changed. Commercial and industrial loans, accounting for 15.7 percent of total loans, decreased 4.4 percent. Loans to individuals, accounting for 4.7 percent of total loans, were essentially unchanged. All other loans, accounting for 7.1 percent of total loans, increased 1.7 percent. During this period, total deposits at these banks decreased 0.6 percent. Agriculture and Natural ResourcesNovember year-to-date commercial red meat production across the District's states was 4.3 percent higher in 2012 than the same period in 2011. By contrast, November year-to-date poultry production as measured by the number of young chickens slaughtered was down 2.2 percent relative to 2011. The District's states ginned 6.4 percent less cotton from January 1 to December 15, 2012, compared with the same period in 2011. Year-to-date coal production in the District's states (excluding eastern Kentucky) at the end of November 2012 was 9.4 percent higher than the same period in 2011, while coal production for November 2012 was roughly on par with production for November 2011. Ninth District--Minneapolis Consumer Spending and TourismOverall consumer spending was up slightly relative to a year ago. The holiday shopping season was somewhat stronger than last year, with bigger gains in North Dakota and Montana. Same-store sales at a Minnesota-based retailer were flat in December compared with a year ago. A Minneapolis area mall reported that holiday traffic was level from a year ago, but sales were up. Activity at a shopping center in South Dakota was relatively level from a year earlier. A North Dakota mall manager reported that December sales were about 10 percent higher than last year; jewelry sales were particularly strong. Retailers in the Great Falls, Mont., area generally reported a solid holiday season. According to the Minneapolis Fed's business outlook survey, 30 percent of respondents expect increases in consumer spending in their communities during 2013; 25 percent expect decreases. These results were similar to last year's survey. Recent new car and truck registrations in Minnesota were higher than a year ago. In Montana, vehicle sales remained steady during the past few months, according to a representative of an auto dealers association. Winter tourism activity was strong in areas with snow, but lackluster in dry areas. A Montana ski resort reported that visits were up and reservations were looking good for the rest of the winter. However, in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, activity was soft due to marginal snow conditions. The winter tourism season got off to a slow start because of a lack of snow in western South Dakota; recent snowfall should help spur activity, according to an official. Construction and Real EstateCommercial construction activity increased at a solid pace since the last report. The permitted value of new commercial construction in December was up 26 percent in Sioux Falls, S.D., and the value of November permits more than doubled in Billings, Mont. A major outlet mall is planned for the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. Residential construction increased considerably from a year ago. The value of November residential building permits in Billings was up 70 percent from last year, and the value of December permits in Sioux Falls was up 39 percent from a year ago. In the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, December residential permits were up 17 percent compared with December 2011. Commercial real estate markets continued to tighten. A major commercial real estate firm forecast that Minneapolis-St. Paul area office vacancy rates will dip to 17.7 percent at the end of 2012 compared with 19.1 percent at the end of 2011. The same firm forecast industrial vacancy rates to drop to 9.9 percent from 11.2 percent. Residential real estate market activity increased. Home sales in November were up 20 percent from the same period a year ago in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area; the inventory of homes for sale was down 29 percent, and median sale prices rose 17 percent. In the Sioux Falls area, November home sales were up 20 percent, inventory was down 14 percent and the median sale price increased 9 percent relative to a year earlier. ServicesActivity at professional business services firms grew since the last report. Services sector respondents to the business outlook poll expect sales volumes and capital investment at their firms to grow in 2013. An appraisal company noted that demand is increasing for its services, and the backlog continues to increase. Another appraiser noted, "I am turning down more business than I am accepting." ManufacturingDistrict manufacturing increased slightly since the last report. According to a December survey of purchasing managers by Creighton University (Omaha, Neb.), manufacturing activity increased in Minnesota and South Dakota after five consecutive months of decreases. Activity also increased in North Dakota, but at a slower pace than in recent months. The Minneapolis Fed's 2012 survey of manufacturers indicated that respondents on average expect orders, production, employment and profits at their operations to increase in the coming year. The outlook for capital investment was flat. A company announced that it is opening a 40,000-square-foot cereal ingredient processing facility in South Dakota. Energy and MiningActivity in the energy sector continued to grow, while mining slowed. District oil production remained at record levels. An oil refinery in Minnesota announced plans for a $400 million upgrade in order to process more oil. Late-December oil and gas exploration activity decreased slightly in North Dakota and increased in Montana from the previous month. A railroad put on hold its plans to expand a coal-shipping line from Wyoming, citing a weaker outlook for domestic coal. Iron ore production remained strong in northern Minnesota; however, recent months were down from levels earlier in 2012. A large mining company announced that it will idle some of its production at operations in Minnesota and the Upper Peninsula in 2013, citing lower ore prices and reduced global demand. A mining company increased its estimate of deposits at a potential copper, nickel and precious metals mine in northern Minnesota. AgricultureAgriculture was steady at high levels. Crop prices came down somewhat recently but remain relatively high, a slight relief to livestock and dairy producers who have been hammered by high feed costs. The selloff of livestock herds continued. Sugarbeet producers in Minnesota and North Dakota saw a record crop in 2012, but prices were down. Prices received by farmers increased in December from a year earlier for corn, wheat, soybeans, chicken, dairy products and cattle. Prices for hogs, turkey, eggs and dry beans decreased. According to the Minneapolis Fed's third-quarter (October) survey of agricultural credit conditions, farmland prices continued their rapid rate of increase. Employment, Wages, and PricesLabor markets tightened modestly since the last report.A manufacturer in Minnesota recently announced plans to open a new facility that would employ 400 new workers. Up to 300 employees are expected to eventually work at a call center in Minnesota. However, an iron ore plant idled 125 workers, and a high tech company laid off over 40 employees in Minnesota due to a slowing in demand. According to respondents to the business outlook poll, 28 percent expect to increase hiring during 2013, while 15 percent expect to decrease staff, similar to last year's poll. Wage increases were moderate. According to the business outlook poll, 93 percent of respondents expect wages in 2013 to increase no more than 3 percent. Business contacts in South Dakota and Montana expected to generally increase wages between 2 percent and 3 percent in 2013 from a year earlier. However, wage increases in the oil-drilling areas of North Dakota and Montana are expected to be higher. Overall price increases were subdued. Minnesota gasoline prices at the end of December were down about 20 cents per gallon since the end of November and were about 10 cents per gallon less than a year ago. A Minnesota-based food maker said it expects ingredient cost inflation of up to 3 percent. Some metals prices increased since mid-November. According to the survey of manufacturers, 37 percent of respondents expect to increase selling prices in 2013, while 16 percent expect to decrease prices. Tenth District--Kansas City Consumer SpendingConsumer spending edged up in November and December, and sales expectations softened heading into the new year. Retail sales rose since the last survey period but retailers expected less growth after the holiday season. Several store owners noted that lower-priced items and home furnishings sold particularly well while sales of high-end items remained sluggish. Auto sales slowed but remained higher than a year ago and some dealers noted undesirably high inventory levels. Near-term sales expectations also eased but generally remained positive. Hotel traffic fell sharply and occupancy rates were substantially below last year's levels. Although tourist activity picked up somewhat, visitor counts remained well below a year ago and were not expected to improve in the near-term. Despite slightly better sales and higher selling prices, restaurant owners turned pessimistic about future sales growth as food costs mounted. Numerous contacts pinned their less positive outlook for future growth on uncertainty associated with the fiscal cliff that was inhibiting consumer spending. Manufacturing and Other Business ActivityManufacturing activity eased since the last survey period, particularly in the non-durable goods sector. Factory production retreated to year-ago levels after a more pronounced contraction in non-durable goods activity trimmed production over the past month. The relative strength of durable goods activity was supported by the production and sales of electrical equipment, appliances, and components. Manufacturers expected generally stronger activity over the next six months. Factory managers at non-durable goods plants, however, were more optimistic about future activity than their peers at durable goods plants with stronger expectations for production, shipments, and new orders over the next six months. Despite a potential rebound in manufacturing activity, factory employment was not expected to rise, with some manufacturers noting that they were delaying hiring plans because of uncertainty in tax and regulatory policies. High-tech service firms expected robust sales and capital spending over the next three months. With railroad traffic continuing to rise and flat sales expectations at transportation service firms, backlogs and capital spending remained solid. Real Estate and ConstructionResidential and commercial real estate sales accelerated since the last survey period despite some weakness in new residential construction. Persistently strong sales of existing residential homes drove prices higher as home inventories continued to fall. Real estate contacts noted that low- to mid-priced homes continued to sell well. Overall mortgage activity and refinancings remained higher than a year ago although expectations for the coming months edged down. Despite recent strength at construction supply firms, sales deteriorated unexpectedly over the past month due partly to higher selling prices. Builders noted that surging lumber and drywall costs led to fewer housing starts in November and December. Commercial real estate markets also improved substantially since the last survey period. Vacancy rates continued to fall with a notable improvement in sales, absorption, and rents, although some contacts noted that economic uncertainty hindered activity. Rising commercial real estate prices were expected to persist in the coming months, but contacts expected a slower pace of both sales activity and absorptions. BankingBankers, on average, reported stronger loan demand, improved loan quality, and higher deposit levels in the recent survey period.  Overall loan demand continued to strengthen, led by demand for residential and commercial real estate loans. Respondents also reported stable loan demand for both commercial and industrial loans and consumer installment loans. Interest rates on commercial and industrial loans continued to edge lower. Most bankers reported improved loan quality compared to a year ago, and they also expected the outlook for loan quality to continue improving over the next six months.  Credit standards remained largely unchanged in all major loan categories and respondents also reported generally higher deposit levels since the last survey period.    AgricultureDrought continued to impact crop conditions and livestock profits improved with higher livestock prices and lower feed costs. District winter wheat conditions remained relatively poor due to persistent drought. The drought also caused water levels on the Mississippi River to fall further, hindering commodity transportation to and from agricultural regions. Still net farm incomes remained high due to historically high crop prices and crop insurance payments. Livestock profit margins also improved over the past six weeks due to a post-harvest decline in crop prices and rising livestock prices. District contacts noted a surge in land sales, sparked by concerns of tax policy changes in the new year. EnergyDistrict energy activity contracted in November and December and was expected to slow further in the coming months. The number of active oil rigs in the District eased from the previous survey period despite a year-end uptick in crude oil prices. The number of active natural gas rigs declined as high supplies of natural gas in storage kept prices from rising due to winter heating needs. Energy contacts expected steady demand to stabilize oil prices and the current oversupply of natural gas to push prices lower. Wyoming's coal output dropped in December and annual production fell moderately short of year-ago levels. District ethanol production remained steady and profit margins, while still poor, improved slightly with easing corn prices. Wages and PricesAlthough wage pressures remained subdued during the survey period, raw materials prices rose further and more companies expected to raise finished goods prices in the coming months. Many businesses reported delaying hiring due to uncertainty surrounding the fiscal cliff and health care policy. Yet, some firms were offering wage premiums to fill specialized positions, particularly in the energy, high-tech, transportation, and construction industries. Raw material costs at factories climbed higher, and more factories planned to raise finished goods prices over the next six months. Builders expected higher prices for many construction materials, particularly lumber and drywall, to continue climbing due to tight supplies. After rising during the holiday shopping season, retailers expected retail prices to flatten during the coming months. Restaurant owners planned to increase menu prices due to high food costs. In contrast, fewer bookings led hotel operators to reduce average room rates. Eleventh District--Dallas PricesMost respondents noted stable prices, although accounting and legal services firms reported a modest rise in billing rates and some transportation service contacts noted an increase in freight charges. Overall, costs were flat to up during the reporting period. Some construction-related manufacturers and transportation service firms noted higher input costs. An aviation manufacturer said they planned to implement price increases this month due to rising input costs. Feed costs for livestock were at record high levels, while prices of other agricultural commodities declined slightly. The price of WTI rose over $90 per barrel during the reporting period. Natural gas prices remained depressed. On-highway diesel and gasoline prices trended down, and prices of petrochemical products were mixed. Labor MarketEmployment held steady or increased at most responding firms. Reports of employment increases came from legal firms, auto dealers, and a few manufacturers. Retailers said employment was up from a year ago, and one contact reported difficulty in filling IT positions. Accounting firms reported hiring at a slower pace than the last report. Auto dealers noted difficulty finding qualified workers, and there were scattered reports of shortages of skilled workers at energy-related firms. Wage pressures remained largely subdued, although airlines reported upward pressure and some construction-related manufacturers reported plans to give cost of living adjustments in January. Manufacturing Construction related manufacturers' reports were mixed. Lumber producers noted stronger sales due to strong single-family construction, but demand for other products remained the same or softened since the last report. Outlooks were uncertain, with some responding firms putting off major decisions until the fiscal cliff was resolved. Demand for fabricated metals also softened over the reporting period, although outlooks for 2013 were optimistic. Primary metals producers noted demand growth was slower than expected. Respondents in high-tech manufacturing said that production and orders were flat to slightly down. One respondent noted that the weak global economy was slowing demand across a broad array of information technology products. Contacts said customer inventories were lean, while producer inventories had increased slightly but remained near desired levels. Respondents' outlooks for the next three to six months were more uncertain than at the time of the last report. Most said that they are planning for weakness to continue, and that they may reduce employment levels in 2013. Demand for paper products was strong in the first part of the reporting period but stalled in recent weeks, in line with normal seasonal patterns. Contacts were more pessimistic in their outlooks, however, due to uncertainty regarding fiscal issues. Food demand increased due to a seasonal pickup, and the outlook was positive among contacts. Overall, transportation manufacturing contacts said demand was mostly flat to up slightly. Automobile manufacturers said business was up, and outlooks were more optimistic. Demand for aviation equipment increased, but remained below year ago-levels. Petrochemicals producers noted Gulf Coast chemical production was up compared with last year. Gulf Coast refineries were operating at rates above 90 percent, and margins remained healthy. Refiners said that despite sluggish domestic demand for distillates, strong export demand has kept inventories from building. Retail SalesRetail sales volumes increased since the last report, mainly due to holiday shopping, and contacts said demand was up year-over-year. According to two national retailers, Texas continued to outperform the nation. Contacts were cautiously optimistic in their outlook for 2013; the largest source of uncertainty among contacts was the fiscal cliff. Reports on automobile sales were mixed over the past six weeks, but were generally positive. All contacts noted that demand was up from a year ago. Selling prices were unchanged since the last report, but manufacturers were offering many more incentives, making the final price to consumers lower. Uncertainty regarding fiscal issues, future taxes, and health care costs, has moderated firms' outlooks. Nonfinancial ServicesStaffing services firms reported mixed results. Most said that demand held steady, while one said orders had softened slightly. Contacts continued to be very concerned about new health care laws in 2014, and some noted their customers' outlooks were more uncertain due to fiscal concerns. Overall, staffing firms' outlooks were slightly more pessimistic than six weeks ago. Overall, accounting activity held steady with little growth; strong energy-related activity was the exception. Contacts expect modest growth in 2013. Legal firms reported steady demand. Transactions and wealth planning practices were reportedly the busiest they have ever been, energy-related activity remained strong, and real estate-related activity was better than expected. Responding firms remained optimistic in their outlooks. Reports from transportation services were mixed. Intermodal cargo volumes edged down seasonally and have slowed from early 2012, but container volumes increased during the reporting period. Railroads said cargo volumes remained steady despite extremely strong growth in energy-related shipments. Grain and coal volumes remained weak spots during the reporting period, but auto shipments increased despite a strike at the Port of Los Angeles that disrupted the flow of containers. Shipping companies said that small parcel volumes posted very strong growth since the last report, particularly due to retail activity. Air cargo volumes were up slightly in preparation for the holiday season. Airline contacts said that passenger demand was soft over the past six weeks. Outlooks from transportation services firms continued to reflect global economic uncertainty, and most firms expect weak growth in the near-term. Construction and Real EstateContacts in the single-family housing sector reported continued improvement in new and existing home sales. Despite increased construction activity housing inventories remain low, pushing overall prices up. Firms remain cautiously optimistic in their outlooks. Apartment demand continued to ease slightly overall, although occupancy rates remain historically high. Demand for office and industrial space increased since the last report, according to contacts in the commercial real estate sector. Most firms expect to see an increase in nonresidential construction in 2013. Commercial property investment activity picked up slightly near year-end, and most respondents were fairly optimistic in their outlooks for 2013. Financial ServicesFinancial institutions reported modest growth in overall lending activity. The increase in corporate loan demand was mostly driven by customers opting to make purchases before year-end due to tax uncertainty, but there was also moderate growth in real estate lending activity. Consumer lending improved, with modest growth in mortgage and new automobile loan demand. Loan pricing remained extremely competitive, and deposits continued to grow despite very low rates. Firms' outlooks remained positive, with fiscal and regulatory concerns posing downside risks. Energy Respondents at energy-related service firms said activity remained at high levels, despite a larger-than-expected decline in the domestic rig count driven by low natural gas prices. Although oil prices remain at healthy enough levels to support current activity, price volatility is making some firms nervous about drilling in higher cost fields. Contacts expect overall activity to be flat this year relative to fourth quarter of 2012, with some improvement expected in the second half of 2013. AgricultureWith little rainfall, most of the District remained in drought conditions since the last report. The drought is negatively impacting the winter wheat crop, and contacts are beginning to express concern for spring planting. Wheat harvest was mostly completed over the last six weeks, and production was up from 2011, mainly because the drought was less severe. Contacts noted that fiscal cliff concerns and the lack of a farm bill are creating a great deal of uncertainty. Twelfth District--San Francisco Wages and PricesUpward price pressures were limited on balance during the reporting period. Price movements for energy items were mixed: retail gasoline prices fell, and electricity prices rose in some areas. Prices for some intermediate materials used in the construction sector, such as drywall and steel rebar, ticked up, while log and pulp prices remained flat. Prices of grapes and nuts increased, and higher prices for grains and corn due to the drought earlier in the year boosted prices of grocery dairy and meat items. A restaurant chain reported menu price increases in the 2 to 3 percent range. Contacts in most sectors reported that upward wage pressures were modest. Limited hiring plans and ready worker availability in most sectors and regions have held down increases in wages and compensation. However, wages increased for some information technology workers who possess advanced skills and are in low supply. The market for technically trained workers for the petroleum industry remains tight. A few contacts expect wage hikes in 2013 in response to the expiration of multiyear, company-wide salary freezes. Health-care benefit cost increases are expected to accelerate and outpace wage increases. Retail Trade and ServicesRetail sales were on a par with or up slightly from last year's holiday season, but generally did not meet vendors' expectations. Online retailers experienced more robust sales growth than traditional brick-and-mortar retailers. Inventories generally were at or near desired levels given the pace of sales, although some retailers reported having an excess of winter apparel due to relatively mild weather conditions, while others ran short on certain consumer technology products. Contacts in the information technology sector indicated strong sales of newer hardware and games, but relatively weak sales of established goods as well as some Internet and digital media products. Both sales and margins were soft for grocers. New automobile sales remained solid, running well above levels from 12 months earlier, with year-end gains expected to be sizeable. Demand for most business and consumer services rose. Contacts pointed to solid sales of various technology services, due mostly to typical year-end business spending increases. Revenues continued to expand for food service providers. Tourism and travel activity in the District was robust, with strong growth of visitor counts and spending reported in both Hawaii and Southern California. However, demand for health-care services remained relatively weak, with some reports of consumers continuing to opt out of elective procedures and health-care providers having excess capacity. ManufacturingDistrict manufacturing activity was mixed across sectors but expanded overall during the reporting period of mid-November through December. With healthy demand for fuel efficient planes and a sustained backlog of orders, production activity for commercial aircraft and parts has been running well above levels from last year. Demand continued to grow at a modest pace for pharmaceutical and wood product manufacturers. By contrast, capacity utilization remained relatively low for manufacturers of technology equipment, and defense manufacturers have been trimming payrolls due to expected federal spending reductions. While demand for scrap metal remained somewhat weak by historical standards, that for steel products used in automotive manufacturing and in infrastructure and nonresidential construction improved. Contacts indicated that production activity picked up at petroleum refineries. Agriculture and Resource-related IndustriesAgricultural output gained further, and extraction activity of natural resources used for energy production continued to expand. Demand for most crop and livestock products continued to advance and was met in part through more intensive use of capital equipment. Extraction activity expanded on balance for petroleum and natural gas, and natural gas inventories remained at historically high levels. Real Estate and ConstructionHousing demand in the District strengthened further, while demand for commercial real estate was largely stable. Both prices and sales transactions of homes climbed in most areas, stimulating continued growth in home construction activity. In some regional markets, activity ratcheted up for higher-priced homes. Construction activity for multifamily residential projects grew further, in response to rising rents and tight availability of lower-priced homes. Demand for nonresidential space was largely stable. However, contacts reported that in select geographic areas of the District, substantial growth of technology firms has boosted demand for office space. Financial InstitutionsContacts from financial institutions reported that loan demand was unchanged or up somewhat. Business loan demand was characterized as moderate. Banking contacts continued to highlight ample liquidity and generally stiff competition among lenders to provide credit to well-qualified business loan applicants, with community banks facing increasing competition from larger national banks for small business lending. Although owner-occupied commercial real estate financing is readily available, banks in most regions remain reluctant to lend to real estate investors outside of the multifamily residential sector. Contacts noted a slight slowdown in IPO, venture capital, and private equity activity in the District's technology, Internet, and digital media subsectors. Consumer lending expanded further, primarily for automobile purchases and new or refinanced home mortgages. Reports indicated that credit quality for both business and consumer loans has continued to improve, albeit at a slow pace. ----------------- ORIGINAL: Minutes away from the release of the Federal Reserve's Beige Book at 2 PM ET, which gives a periodic glimpse of the state of the U.S. economy through anecdotes from various industries.

Most CEOs don't have the time to personally interview every person who joins their company. But they absolutely set the priorities and culture that factor into every single hiring decision, and are intensely involved with top level hires. Those are some of the most important decisions they can make, so company leaders tend to have strong opinions about the kind of people they want at their company.Â  So whether you're eyeing the C-suite or trying to figure out what gets you in the door at some of America's biggest companies, we've compiled some of the best tips executives have shared over the years on what impresses them, including top tech CEOs like Steve Ballmer, entrepreneurial icons like Elon Musk, and empire builders like Richard Branson.

St. Louis FedGermany is repatriating 374 tons of its gold held in Paris and a further 300 tons of gold stored in New York by 2020. At current prices this is valued at $36 billion and represents 19 percent of Germany's gold reserves. The news has sparked some conspiracy theories about the safety of the Federal Reserve and German-U.S. relations. But in a Financial Times editorial PIMCO's Mohamed El-Erian writes that this is just about internal pressures growing in Germany ahead of elections: "Since the start of the European debt crisis in 2009-10, citizens have gotten increasingly concerned about other countries’ ability to access their income. It is one thing for Germany to commit to a one-off loan to Greece. It is another for it to be part of recurrent bailouts, both direct and indirect, for a potentially expanding set of European countries. Germans also realise that the more loans they make to struggling economies, the less likely they are to get fully repaid. Already, there is — understandable and realistic — talk that official creditors will have no choice but to forgive part of their financial claims on Greece. It is not unusual for concerns about open-ended income transfers to evolve into broader worries about the integrity of the nation’s wealth and well-being. ...Over the last few months, there has been a debate in Germany about the safety of the country’s gold stock held in other countries – amplified by recognition that the historical case for holding the gold abroad is no longer as valid." But El-Erian warns that this does carry an international risk since it could pressure other countries to repatriate their offshore gold holdings. And this could in turn spark larger political tensions, "then the world would find itself facing even greater difficulties resolving payments imbalances and resisting beggar-thy-neighbor national policies".

Documents seen by The Daily Telegraph show that the financier invoiced the bombed-out coal miner for Â£4.36m between July 2010 and December 2011 for flights on his Gulfstream jet. The invoices, in euros, include â‚¬286,137 (Â£237,400) for travel between Paris, Doha, Singapore, Vienna and Luton in November 2010 for meetings relating to the creation of Bumi â€“ the group he formed via a fateful $3bn (Â£1.87bn) deal with Indonesiaâ€™s Bakrie family. Mr Rothschild also put in a â‚¬360,569 invoice for a six-day site visit and analyst meeting that took in stops in Jakarta and Beijing in December 2010, where the six passengers included Bumiâ€™s former finance director Andy Beckham. He also invoiced â‚¬255,417 for a trip to Nouakchott, Mauritania, in March 2011 that also involved stops in Vienna, Hong Kong and Tel Aviv and â‚¬114,832 for a journey described as â€œBakrie meeting in Dubai @ airportâ€ in May 2011, which started from Bordeaux. There is no suggestion that the flights were not authorised by the Bumi board, whose senior independent director Sir Julian Horn-Smith also used Mr Rothschildâ€™s jet. Sir Julian was the sole passenger when he travelled between London and Berlin for a board meeting in June 2011. The invoice for that was â‚¬62,146. Mr Rothschildâ€™s private jet has become the latest bone of contention between the financier and the board in the bitter row over control of Bumi. It was brought to a head last week by the decision of Mr Rothschild, who controls 18.2pc of the votes, to call for an EGM in an attempt to oust 12 of 14 directors. Sources close to Mr Rothschild insist that the flight expenses were not only approved by the board but should be offset against his decision to waive Â£10m of adviser fees for bringing the Bumi transaction to the company. â€œThat saved the company Â£7m,â€ said one. Lord Renwick, the non-executive director who chairs Bumiâ€™s audit committee, said the board approved Mr Rothschildâ€™s use of the jet at the outset when he employed it to raise funds for his Vallar cash shell â€“ the financial vehicle he used to acquire Bumi. â€œHe took the lead in helping to raise $1bn at Vallar and, to be fair to Nat, he devoted enormous energy to that,â€ Lord Renwick said. â€œIt was argued by the audit committee that, as Nat had to race around the world, he could use the private jet for that purpose. However, later it became a lifestyle choice. He was using it when it was not operationally necessary.â€ Mr Rothschild claimed â‚¬316,701 for a three-day trip in September 2011 to meet Nirwan and Indra Bakrie that involved flights from London to Baku, Jakarta, Tokyo and Newark. The only other passenger was Tom Daniel, one of the Vallar advisers. Mr Rothschild also put in a â‚¬79,792 invoice for return flights from Paris for a meeting at Londonâ€™s 4 Grosvenor Place in October 2011. The financier, who quit the board in October to fight for minority shareholders, flew to Mauritania to try to establish what had happened to funds that had disappeared from one of Bumiâ€™s associate companies. Nick von Schirnding, Bumiâ€™s new chief executive, said he had ended any use of private jets at Bumi. â€œDriving down costs is my number one priority,â€ he said. â€œFirst class travel and private jets have no role in the organisation I am running.â€ To set an example â€œfrom the topâ€, he said, he had â€œstarted an urgent review of head office costs and we will be getting out of our head office in Knightsbridge, which is totally inappropriateâ€. Mr Rothschild declined to comment
Of the ten sectors that stocks are divided into, Consumer Discretionary stocks have been on the longest streak of beating the S&amp;P 500. Telecom stocks, though not on quite as much a streak as Consumer Discretionary, have been outperforming for three years now. And that is why they probably won't do quite so well in 2013, argue the analysts at Goldman Sachs. Extended winning and losing streaks at the sector level are pretty rare, which sets a historical precedent that could mean a headwind for Discretionary and Telecom Services in 2013. The same goes the other way. Returns on Financials stocks, which had been on a five-year losing streak until last year, finally turned around in 2012. From Goldman's report: "Since 1975 there have been six cases each of a sector beating the market for five or more consecutive years and five cases of a sector lagging the S&amp;P 500 for that many consecutive years. The longest streaks both occurred from 1984 to 1991 when Industrials lagged the market for those eight years while Consumer Staples beat the market each year over the same period. The only sector with two winning streaks of at least five years is Energy from 1976 through 1980 and 2004 through 2008." Here's a chart from the same report, that points out the various winning and losing streaks that the S&amp;P 500 has seen since 1974. Blue means that overall that sector provided positive returns, white means negative returns. Goldman Sachs
WikipediaA view of LanzhouBEIJING is frequently shrouded in dense, yellowish smog so thick that the other side of the road is obscured. But the deadly smog that enveloped the city over the past weekend was so bad that air-quality readings from a monitor on the roof of the American Embassy said simply: "Beyond Index." The embassy uses the US Environmental Protection Agency's air-quality index (AQI), which measures PM 2.5 (particulate matter of 2.5 microns across or less per cubic metre). Such particles are small enough to be inhaled and can damage lungs. The AQI range ends at 500; at one point a reading of 886 microns was recorded. A reading above 100 is deemed “unhealthy for sensitive groups” and anything above 400 is rated “hazardous” for all.  These independent readings have put pressure on the authorities to release more detailed data of their own. A year ago Beijing's municipal officials bowed to public pressure and started reporting data on PM 2.5 for the first time. But Beijing is not even the most polluted city in China.  Using a different but more widely used measure collated by the World Health Organisation of larger particulate matter called PM 10 (particles of 10 microns or less), which allows cross-country comparisons, that dubious honour is bestowed on Lanzhou in the north-western province of Gansu (and the city of Ludhiana in India is more polluted still). Better data may soon be available. This month China’s Ministry of Environmental Protection announced that 74 cities were to begin monitoring and reporting the levels of multiple pollutants, including PM 2.5, sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide and ozone.  The Economist Click here to subscribe to The Economist

Brian GiesenIt finally happened. After a report in a German business daily earlier this week, the Bundesbank has today confirmed it will take back large quantities of its gold stored in New York and France. The AP reports that all 374 tons of German gold held in Paris and a further 300 tons of gold stored in New York will be moved back to vaults in Frankfurt by 2020. That amount is worth $36 billion at current market prices. It represents about 19 percent of Germany's gold reserves. Germany has the second highest holdings of gold in the world, which has long been stored overseas due to decades old Cold War fears of a Soviet invasion. However, with that fear gone, a movement within Germany to take back the country's gold has gathered momentum over the last few years. Last may, a "Bring back our Gold" campaign was launched and appeared to be impacting the mainstream. A big part of this is due to Peter Gauweiler, the head of the conservative Christian Social Union (CSU), who has for years demanded to know exactly where Germany's gold is (He eventually was allowed to visit the Bundesbank's domestic gold in storage in Frankfurt). Gauweiler's argument was bolstered by a recent report from Germany's Federal Audit Office that sternly criticized the German central bank. The report, while apparently routine, looked like a key piece of evidence to those expecting some sort of conspiracy theory. As Der Spiegel described it last year: Indeed, the partially blacked-out report read like the prologue to an espionage thriller in which the stunned central bankers could end up standing in front of empty vaults in the US. It turned out that German bankers had not been allowed to see their gold for decades â€” standard practice for gold vaults around the world â€” but in 2007 they were finally allowed in, and, after further inquiries, finally allowed to touch some of the gold in 2011. This may all seem a bit crazy, but it's hardly unprecedented. Ambrose Evans-Pritchard of The Telegraph has noted that secret German reports say country took two-thirds of its gold back shortly after the start of the Euro a decade ago. He believes this may have been ordered as the Bank of England was selling off its own gold and there were fears that the gold may not be clearly allocated to Germany. As John Browne, a Senior Market Strategist at Euro Pacific Capital, observed last year, the entire system for gold storage is pretty crazy. He describes it as requiring "a level of central bank cooperation and trust that staggers the imagination. Allied governments appear to have "trusted" one another with the stewardship of hundreds of billions of dollars worth of unallocated, and in some cases uninventoried, gold bars. This policy borders on financial negligence." Now Germany has another problem â€” how to move over 600 tons of gold. "For security reasons we can't discuss that, partly to protect the gold, partly to protect the staff that will be carrying out the transfer," saidÂ Bundesbank spokesperson Moritz August Raasch said today. Raasch assured the AP that all transfers will be insured. SEE ALSO: 10 Countries Hoarding Enormous Stockpiles Of Gold &gt;

screenshotA helicopter scene from "James Bond: Die Another Day"This morning in London a helicopter crashed into a crane and exploded into a ball of flames. According to The Telegraph, the crane was on St. George's tower, and the helicopter itself was an Agusta 109. The pilot and one person on the ground were killed, and six more people have been taken to the hospital, according to officials. Police sayÂ the helicopter was on a commercial flight from Surrey.Â A spokesmanÂ for theÂ London HeliportÂ at BatterseaÂ said the pilot, Peter Barnes,Â requested to divert and land thereÂ because of the foggy weather. The Associated Press reports that Barnes, 50, made a career flying in films including "Saving Private Ryan" and the James Bond movie "Die Another Day." "He was a very highly skilled pilot, one of the most experienced in the U.K., with over 12,000 flying hours," Philip Amadeus, managing director the executive helicopter charter business RotorMotion, told the AP. The tower is in the busy Vauxhall section of the city, and close toÂ the headquarters of spy agency MI6.Â  Twitter userÂ @craigletÂ posted this picture from across the street:Â  Twitter/@craiglet A witnessÂ told The GuardianÂ that the helicopter "ripped the scaffolding [crane] in half like a piece of paper. You could see the helicopter was distressed before it got to the building ... â€œYou couldn't see the light on the top [of the building]. It was like it [the helicopter] was blinded. You could see that it didn't know which way to turn and it just sliced in to the building. And it sounded like â€“ you know that sound when someone drags their nails down a blackboard but it was even worse. I was like a screeching...It was slicing into the metal of the tower.â€ Twitter user @tom_avis posted this picture of the broken crane. @tom_avis Two cars on the ground are also said to be part of the crash. Vauxhall MP Kate Hoey believes the crash should lead to a review of helicopter flights over London. "The river is the motorway for helicopters," Hoey told The Telegraph. "Maybe we've come to take it almost for granted that people have the right to take their helicopter over London any time they want. The regulations are very clear about helicopters not flying less than 500ft away from structures and so on." The Guardian has an article discussing the strict rules governing helicopters in central London. Here's The Associated Press video from the scene:  And here's is a clearer view of the aftermath: 
Now Fortune reports that TPG has walked away. That leaves Silver Lake to figure out how it could take on the biggest leveraged buy-out Wall Street has seen since before the financial crisis, when a lack of credit made it impossible for a deal this large to get done. All told, estimates put the size of a potential Dell deal at $23 to $25 billion, with about $5 billion kicked in by private equity firms. That's nothing to sneeze at, and observers have already pointed out that no private equity firm could raise that kind of capital alone. So now that TPG is out (it was in totally separate negotiations from Silver Lake), we'll have to see if any other big PE players enter the ring. Either way, for its part, Silver Lake isn't giving up, according to the WSJ. Silver Lake Partners was in discussions Tuesday with Dell for a leveraged buyout at around $13 to $14 a share, according to a person familiar with the matter. The buyout group would include the private-equity firm, at least one other investor such as a pension or sovereign wealth fund, and Mr. Dell, this person said. Michael Dell himself owns 16 percent of the firm, so that makes financing the deal a little easier. At the same time, there is an inherent conflict of interest investors consider when the management of a company enters a buy-out deal as a major player. Sure, having an independant board helps with this conflict. Also, dealmakers can negotiate "go-shop" agreements that open the door to competing bids in the event of disagreements between parties.Â  Still, there's another, brutal issue with management's role in this buy-out that Fortune's Katie Benner discusses. Benner points out that Michael Dell is not an innovator, and with the power he would likely retain in this deal, he would still be at the head of a company that requires innovation. From Fortune: ..as Fortune chronicled in a 2011 look into the company, Dell has been an architect of his company's strategy woes as much as he was the genius behind its initial manufacturing success... His plan has been to acquire scores of small companies and hope that the new entrepreneurs injected some innovation, fresh ideas and talent into the company... Michael Dell seemed unconcerned that these acquisitions were just too small to move the revenue and profit needles. And he alone seemed to set the parameters for the company's vision and mission... Most companies go private because they have an execution problem, and a buyout firm promises a solution that's often some combination of cost reduction, management changes, and a bold strategy shift. Dell is already known for being among the most cost conscious companies around. Michael Dell's likely involvement post-buyout will mean no real management change. And he has made it clear over the last six years that he does not favor bold strategy shifts. He prefers to change the company in a slow and steady fashion, much like Lou Gerstner at IBM before him. But IBM was ahead of the curve when it moved away from PCs. Dell is behind that curve, and doesn't have the luxury of time. In short, Benner points out that the problem with Dell isn't that it's a public company, it's that it's a public company run by Michael Dell. Harsh.

APThe overall favorability rating of the NRA has plunged in the last month, putting its image in a negative light for the first time. In separate polls conducted by Public Policy Polling and the Washington Post/ABC News, the association's favorability ratings sit underwater with the majority of Americans. The PPP poll shows a big shift from before CEO Wayne LaPierre's press conference, which cast blame on the media, and violent video games and movies for the elementary-school massacre in Newtown, Conn., last month. Before the press conference, 48 percent of Americans viewed the organization in a positive light, compared with 41 percent who viewed it unfavorably. After the press conference and a subsequent appearance on "Meet the Press," the NRA's favorability shifted to a 42-45 negative split â€” a 10-point swing in three weeks. Meanwhile, the Washington Post and ABC found that the NRA's favorability rating is underwater for the first time ever in their limited polling of the question. According to the poll, only 36 percent said they have a favorable opinion of the NRA, compared with 44 percent who view it in a negative light. When the WaPo/ABC last polled on the subject in 1999, the group's favorability rating stood comfortably positive at a 48-39 split. The hit to the organization's image comes as it is taking heat for an ad that calls President Barack Obama an "elitist hypocrite" for sending his children to a school with armed protection. The NRA has come out in force against Obama's plans to introduce more restrictive gun legislation, which he will formally announce today at the White House. Â 
The CFA Institute recently conducted an interesting survey that Cullen Roche of the Pragmatic Capitalism blog pointed out to us this morning. 999 respondents answered the question, "Which has been the greatest investing lesson for you during the past five year?" Nearly 60 percent of respondents believe that "central banks and governments will continue to bail out troubled creditors." This is somewhat troubling.Â  There's an idea out there that big, systemically important financial institutions are more likely to take more risk if they believe they'll be bailed out in the worst-case scenario.Â  As such, this may have permanently changed the behavior of the biggest players in the financial markets. Here are the results from the CFA Institute's survey of just under a thousand investors: CFA Institute
At the World MoneyShow, an annual event that takes place in Orlando, Florida, every February, financial riches and opportunity are always just around the corner.Â  Â "This thing can be bought out for a billion dollars at any time," I hear someone say as I stroll along the mobbed, football-field-sized exhibition floor. At the booth for Best Choice Software, the pitchman, surrounded by a swarm of mostly elderly men, is yelling energetically, â€œIâ€™ve made millions of dollars using this system!â€ In the conference rooms of the Gaylord Hotel, discount offers onÂ unlimited riches proliferate. â€œPontificators tell you what the market is going to do. Iâ€™m going to tell you what day it is going to happen,â€ says Mike Turner, a balding middle-aged man promoting CycleProphet, a tool he claims can help investors make gains of 70 percent annually.Â "I know what silver is going to do next week and the week after.â€ In another room I meet up with Oliver Velez, a day-trading guru peddling an $8,000 two-day seminar ($7,500 ifÂ purchased at the MoneyShow) designed to teach anyone to beat the markets. Velez tells the crowd he almost never makes a bad trade.  â€œA lot of peopleÂ say â€˜Oliver, can you tell us about any of your losers?â€™ I say, â€˜No, I have no losers.â€™ I had one losing trade in 2010, and that was more of break even.â€ Hundredsâ€”if not thousandsâ€”of events designed to reach out toÂ consumers interested in finding out more about investing opportunities are held around the country every year. They range from little known gatherings like the yearly Road to Personal Wealth in New Jersey to ones that appeal to the wealthy, like the Value Investing Congress, where, in return for several thousand dollars, an active investor can listen to prominent hedge funders such as David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital make a case for various shorts, such as his famous negative call on Lehman Brothers in the fall of 2007. Others are virtual and constant, such as the daily barrage of tweetsÂ one can receive from StockTwits, an aggregator of 140-character investment tidbits, helmed by serial Internet entrepreneur Howard Lindzon. But MoneyShow is one of the big kahunasâ€”a multi-million-dollar empire devoted to all things supposedly useful to the individual investor, including stock-picking products and chances to buy into oil and gas partnerships. In 2012, MoneyShowâ€™s corporate arm (also called MoneyShow) put on twelve live events on four continents, in cities including New York, London, Las Vegas, and Shanghai. In Orlando, there are at least 275 speeches, educational seminars, and product presentations all adding up to a cacophony of competing theories and strategies. But whether one can actually learn anything at the MoneyShow, atÂ Value Investing Congress, or by paying close attention to StockTwits is subject to debate.Â Brad Barber and Terrance Odean are behavioral finance experts and business professors at the University of Californiaâ€”Barber at Berkeley, Odean sixty-five miles down the road in Davis. To read the combined opus of Barber and Odean is to plunge intoÂ an unexpected comedy of errors. In a series of papers, the two men have laid out the case that the vast majority of investors miss no opportunity to make a wrong call. They sell their winners too soon and their losing picks not soon enough. They perform less research than they think. They like to buy the same stocks over and over again, even if they have a history of loss with that stock. Their investment thumbs are so black they enjoy â€œperverse security selection abilities,â€ a seemingly innate talent for buying â€œstocks that earn subpar returnsâ€ while selling â€œstocks that earn strong returns.â€Â There are reams of research data to back up Barber and Odean. In 1999, at the height of the dot-com bubble, the North American Securities Administrators Association discovered that 70 percent of short-term traders lost money. Currency traders do no better: according to papers filed with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, almost three out of four account holders at such popular foreign currency trading brokerages as FXCM, Inc. and Gain Capital Holdings lost money in every quarter of 2010. Nor do the pros know the secret. The vast majority of managed mutual funds will perform worse than their benchmark. CXO Advisory Watch, which tracks the self-proclaimed experts, has found that with many, bluster beats actual performance time and time again, so much so that, in their view, astrologer Linda Schurman has a better accuracy rate than noted economist Abby Joseph Cohen. The recent predictive record of the Ira Sohn Investor Conference, an annual gathering of hedge fund stars, is dismal, with the vast majority of 2011 pitches revealed as losers when analyzed one year later. Even Harvey Houtkin, the father of day trading, made his millions not from successful stock picks, but from convincing others that they had the ability to make such picks themselves, racking up millions in commissions from customers of â€¨his day-trading firm while losing hundreds of thousands of dollars on his own investments. Individual stock trading is a loserâ€™s game. So why do we bother? Because not everyone does badly. There's Warren Buffett. Peter Lynch. And maybe, just maybe, you.
The U.S. is currently coming down from mid-cycle in the business cycle and will likely stay that way, provided that debt ceiling discussions go smoothly.  This is according to Lisa Embso-Mattingly, an economist at Fidelity Investments. This means that growth might not be as strong at it was when the U.S. economy went from -3.5% in 2009 to a 3% growth in 2010, she said.  But it will grow. "2% is the new normal," she said. Here's where the U.S. is on the recession cycle, with respect to Germany, China and Japan, according to a report by Fidelity's Embso-Mattingly and Dirk Hofschire: Fidelity Investments Embso-Mattingly told Business Insider that there are three factors that determine where a country lies on the recession cycle: credit, profit and inventory. Right now, thanks to the Fed's "extraordinary" easy money policy, which Embso-Mattingly predicts will continue for a few more quarters, the U.S. is fairly well positioned on the credit cycle. Corporate profits, however are on the decline. Wall Street analysts have been revising their estimates for fourth quarter earnings growth for the S&amp;P 500 downwards.  And these already low estimates will probably see another downwards revision, according to a report by Morgan Stanley: "Earnings expectations for 2013 have declined substantially since the start of 2012. 2013 EPS estimates have fallen from $121 at the beginning of 2012 to $114 now. We expect 2013 earnings estimates to weaken further and forecast $99 of EPS—a 1.0% decline in earnings from 2012 (versus consensus expectation of an 11% increase)." Inventory, however, is in a better position, with supply getting closer to demand. Here's a chart of the inventory (supply) to sales (demand) ratio from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis which shows exactly that: FRED Economic Data Most economies spent most of their time mid-cycle, said Embso-Mattingly, which is why it makes sense that the U.S. is likely to continue on this path of slow but steady growth. Unless policymakers can't resolve the debt ceiling issue, that is.
This weekend, the news broke that JP Morgan may release a massive report reviewing what caused the painful $6.2 billion loss in its London Chief Investment Office known as the London Whale trade. Today the 132 page review was released, along with the news that bank CEO Jamie Dimon would take a substantial pay cut as a result of his personal negligence. That buck, after all, stops with him. But of course, that isn't the whole story. The full report details how (and why) traders in JP Morgan's CIO took such a huge, risky position in Synthetic Credit Derivatives. Perhaps more importantly, it discloses also excruciating details on why losses from that position were never meaningfully analyzed and disclosed to senior management until it was too late. The story really starts at the end of 2011, as the firm was working on reducing risk weighted assets (RWA).  Management was looking to the CIO to help the firm do that. However, a trader prepared a report on what would happen if the CIO reduced its credit derivatives portfolio by 35%. It indicated that doing that would cost the firm $500 million, so the idea was nixed. Then in January 2012, the CIO started losing a little money (pg 28): In early January, the Synthetic Credit Portfolio incurred mark-to-market losses of approximately $15 million. On January 10, one of the traders informed Ms. Drew that the losses resulted from the fact that (among other things) it “ha[d] been somewhat costly to unwind” positions in the portfolio. So CIO head Ina Drew started looking for some flexibility in her mandate to get rid of RWA so that her division could maximize profits and losses (p&amp;l). In other words, the CIO thought it would be really expensive to simply unwind their positions, so they wanted to pursue a different strategy that would allow them to hold the positions until the end of the year when management and traders alike believed the global economy would improve. This was the new plan (pg 29): On or about January 18, Ms. Drew, Mr. Wilmot, Mr. Weiland and two senior members of the Synthetic Credit Portfolio team met to further discuss the Synthetic Credit Portfolio and RWA reduction. According to a trader who had not attended the meeting, after the meeting ended, one of the Synthetic Credit Portfolio team members who had attended the meeting informed him that they had decided not to reduce the Synthetic Credit Portfolio, and that the trader’s focus in managing the Synthetic Credit Portfolio at that point should be on profits and losses. Nonetheless, RWA continued to be a matter of real concern for that individual and CIO, and he thus also sent a follow-up e-mail to the meeting participants in which he set out a number of options for achieving RWA reduction by the end of 2012. In that e-mail, he stated that the preferred approach was to select an option under which CIO would attempt to convince the Firm to modify the model that it used to calculate RWA for the Synthetic Credit Portfolio, and delay any efforts to reduce RWA through changes in positions in the Synthetic Credit Portfolio until mid-year. As these talks went on, the CIO continued to lose money in its Synthetic Credit Portfolio. One reason was that "a significant corporate issuer defaulted on its debt." That prompted the CIO to ask traders to hedge the Synthetic Credit Portfolio more, or as the report says, put more '“jump-to-default” protection in place.' So instead of unwinding, the CIO was adding. By the end of the month, a trader was getting worried (pg 34): In separate e-mails on January 30, the same trader suggested to another (more senior) trader that CIO should stop increasing “the notionals,” which were “become[ing] scary,” and take losses (“full pain”) now; he further stated that these increased notionals would expose the Firm to “larger and larger drawdown pressure versus the risk due to notional increases.” While the documentary record does not reflect how, if at all, the more senior trader responded to these concerns, the traders nonetheless continued to build the notional size of the positions through late March. Around late February traders started thinking things were going terribly, terribly wrong. The Synthetic Credit Portfolio had experienced year to date losses of $169 million. The IG-9 trade — the trade that eventually blew a hole into JP Morgan — was losing ground. The traders disagreed on how to deal with the bloodletting. They could either stop trading and see what the IG-9 would do, or build more hedges around it. They chose to build more hedges (pg 36): ...he...advised another Synthetic Credit Portfolio trader not to trade IG-9 because he wanted to observe its behavior. He also advised a more senior trader of his plans, but the latter instructed him to trade because they needed to participate in the market to understand the price at which parties were actually willing to transact. The trader engaged in a significant amount of trading at the end of February, after being directed by at least one senior member of the Synthetic Credit Portfolio team to increase the default protection in the Synthetic Credit Portfolio. The trader also traded at this time in order to determine the market prices of the positions. His trading was not limited to short positions; he also added a significant amount of long positions – specifically in the IG-9 index – in order to offset the cost and risk of the additional short positions... More hedging, more complexity — the portfolio kept getting bigger and bigger. As a result, the CIO got spanked in February (pg 4): By the end of February, the Synthetic Credit Portfolio had experienced an additional $69 million in mark-to-market losses, from approximately $100 million (year-to-date through January) to $169 million (year-to-date through February). This kind of trading continued til the end of March. On April 5th, however, JP Morgan became aware that the 'London Whale' story was about to break. CIO head Ina Drew reached out to the JP Morgan Operating Committee and told them that the CIO was experiencing unforeseen losses (pg 57): She acknowledged that (1) the position was not sized or managed well; (2) mistakes were made, which she was in the process of addressing; (3) the losses to date were approximately $500 million, which netted to negative $350 million as a result of gains in other positions; and (4) Firm earnings for the first quarter had not been affected “since [CIO] realized gains out of the [$]8.5 billion of value built up in the securities book.” That's when Drew asked her trader to perform a full diagnostic of the portfolio focusing on profits and losses. At that point, traders were still confident that the CIO could hold their position (pg 58). This individual said he would perform the work, and explained that any further losses would be the “result of further distortions and marks between the series where we are holding large exposures.” He added that he had “no doubt that both time and events are healing our position,” and stated that a trader with whom he had consulted was “convinced that our overall economic risk is limited.”He also noted that the traders were concerned that information about CIO’s Synthetic Credit Portfolio position had been leaked to the market – a concern they had expressed previously – suggesting that the losses may have been driven by their counterparties who, they believed, knew of CIO’s positions and were distorting the market... although he would conduct a confirmatory analysis, the worst-case scenario for the second quarter (excluding “very adverse” outliers) would involve losses of no more than “-200 MM USD . . . with the current book as it is.” So it's early April, the London Whale story is about to come out, and the CIO still thinks things are basically under control. This is likely what prompted Dimon's "tempest in a teapot" dismissal of the story.  Another thing that likely gave Dimon confidence was the report a trader prepared for Drew on April 7th. It was supposed to be an analysis running doomsday scenarios on Synthetic Credit Portfolio — but that's not what it was. A senior trader told the junior trader working on the report that he didn't want to "scare" Drew with large losses. So the senior trader had the junior trader change the analysis to reflect better profits and losses (pg 59). Specifically, he informed the trader who had generated the estimates that he had too many negative scenarios in his initial work, and that he was going to scare Ms. Drew if he said they could lose more than $200 or $300 million. This was a "Monte Carlo analysis" — a simulation in which a portfolio is run many times and the results are then averaged to reflect profits and losses (pg 59): He therefore directed that trader to run a so- called “Monte Carlo” simulation... The trader who had generated the estimates did not believe the Monte Carlo simulation was a meaningful stress analysis because it included some scenarios in which the Synthetic Credit Portfolio would make money which, when averaged together with the scenarios in which it lost money, would result in an estimate that was relatively close to zero. He performed the requested analysis, however, and sent the results to the other trader in a series of written presentations over the course of the weekend. This work was the basis for a second- quarter loss estimate of -$150 million to +$250 million provided to senior Firm management... So in order not to alarm Ms. Drew, the traders turned in a report that was likely too positive, in the trader's own view. That report, however, lead senior management to believe that they had a firm grasp what was going on in the CIO. Traders engaged in this type of behavior through early April, disagreeing forcefully on how big the losses in the CIO would be. A junior trader would forecast big losses, and a senior trader would disagree, and estimate much, much smaller losses. Here's a perfect example: The first trading day after the London Whale report was released (April 10th), a junior trader said he expected a loss of $700 million on the trade. A senior trader responded to that very badly, saying that the junior was undermining his credibility at the firm (pg 64). At 7:02 p.m. GMT on April 10, the trader with responsibility for the P&amp;L Predict circulated a P&amp;L Predict indicating a $5 million loss for the day; according to one of the traders, the trader who circulated this P&amp;L Predict did so at the direction of another trader. From $700 million to $5 million is quite a leap, and according to the report, the traders had a "confrontation" on the matter. As a result of their "confrontation", expected losses were adjusted to $400 million, and on that day the CIO lost $412 million on the trade. When first quarter earnings were announced on April 13th, senior management, including Drew and Dimon, continued to believe everything was under control. That week, the Synthetic Credit Portfolio lost $117 million. In wasn't until the week after earnings were announced — around April 23rd — that all hell broke loose. Over 6 trading days, the CIO lost $800 million (pg 74). On April 23, the Synthetic Credit Portfolio experienced a single-day loss of approximately $161 million. This was followed by losses of approximately $82 million and $188 million on April 24 and 25, respectively (with a total loss of almost $800 million over the course of the six trading days ending on April 30). These losses were inconsistent with the earlier loss estimates and prediction from one of the traders that the market would “mean revert,” and they caused Messrs. Dimon, Braunstein and Hogan as well as Ms. Drew to question whether the Synthetic Credit Portfolio team adequately understood the Synthetic Credit Portfolio or had the ability to properly manage it. That's when JP Morgan went into emergency mode. Senior risk managers flew from New York to London to conduct an in-depth review of the portfolio. They pushed aside previous reports from the CIO, and dug into the trade themselves. By April 29th, Dimon and other members of JP Morgan senior management asked this risk team to take responsibility for the Synthetic Credit Portfolio. That takes us to May 2nd, the day JP Morgan decided to tell the world that it had lost $2 billion and that the carnage wouldn't end until the bank unwound the now massive portfolio that caused such painful losses.

AP Photo/Matt YorkAfter rising for eight straight months, homebuilder sentiment stayed at 47 in January, missing expectations of a rise to 48. The index continues to be at its highest level since April 2006. Conditions in the housing market look much better now than at the beginning of 2012 and an increasing number of housing markets are showing signs of recovery, which should bode well for future home sales later this year,â€ said Barry Rutenberg, chairman of the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) in a press release. â€œHowever, uncertainties stemming from last monthâ€™s fiscal cliff negotiations contributed to the pause in builder confidence and continuing discussions among policymakers related to spending cuts and the future of the mortgage interest deduction could put a damper on housing demand in the coming months.â€ The current sales component of the index stayed at 51 in January. But sales expectations for the next six months fell one point to 49. Original The NAHB housing market index for January is out at 10 a.m. ET. Analysts polled by Bloomberg are looking for the index to rise to 48, from 47 the previous month. The index has been up for eight straight months. A reading of 50 shows that an equal number of builders view the market as good or bad.  The National Association of Home Builders' housing market index is a sentiment index in which respondents rate not just the housing market but also the economy in general. The index draws on builder perceptions of current single-family home sales and sales expectations for the next six months. It also includes builders' expectations of traffic of prospective buyers.
While it ballooned to $2.7 trillion, 17.9% of GDP, or $8,680 per capita, households have lowered their share. And so have businesses. What gives? Despite improvements in the unemployment rate, 32.1% of all working households “may not have enough money to meet basic needs,” the report found. That was for 2011. In 2007, 28% of all families fell into that category. There are now 47.5 million low-income working families (earning less than 200% of the official poverty rate of $22,811 for a family of four). The report fingers in part the new job market. As people are finding jobs, they’re earning lower wages and have fewer benefits “compared with the middle-class jobs they held before.” After housing expenses and day-to-day essentials, such as food and energy, little if any money remains for medical expenses. But there is a parallel phenomenon: high-deductible health insurance plans linked to tax-advantaged IRA-like Health Savings Accounts. While deductibles range from $1,000 to $4,000 or more, the much lower premiums and tax savings can turn this into a bonanza for healthy people — if they keep their medical expenses down. The plans have taken off, much to the lament of healthcare providers. In 2006, only 10% of those with health insurance opted for a high-deductible plan; by 2012, their ranks had swollen to 34%! These two large (and overlapping) groups — those who cannot spend more money on healthcare, and those who have a profit incentive not to — amount to a paradigm shift. They have lowered the household share of US healthcare spending. And it’s causing “unprecedented concerns” in the industry [The American Consumer Revolts Against Prescription Drugs]. But consumers aren’t the only players. This is the $2.7 trillion healthcare pie, a depiction of who pays what:  In 2011, households paid for 27.7% of all health care expenses—insurance premiums, out-of-pocket expenses, and supplementary premiums paid to Medicare. Year after year, they spent more than they’d spent the year before. But overall healthcare spending ballooned even faster, and as households were no longer able or willing to play along, they cut their share of overall healthcare spending. In 1988, households paid for 36.8% of the total healthcare pie. Then their share declined, except for a slight rise during the late 1990s. When the financial crisis hit, layoffs washed over the land. Households axed healthcare expenses, cutting their share from 29.2% in 2008 to 28.3% in 2009. Despite a “recovery” in the job market, their share continued to drop, reaching a low of 27.7% in 2011. Businesses, too, spent more year after year in absolute terms, but unlike consumers, their share edged up as well, particularly during the dot-com bubble. But when the bubble burst, the tightening began in earnest, reducing the business share from 25.1% in 2000 to 20.6% in 2011.  What gives? Consumers and businesses, responsible for over 60% of healthcare spending in 1988, have cut their combined share to 48%. Somebody had to pick up the difference. Well, yes. Governments. Particularly through Medicare and Medicaid. The share of state and local governments edged up from 15% in 1988 to 17.4% in 2011. The share of the federal government rose from 15.9% in 1988 to 27.6% in 2011. Though that’s down from 28.3% in 2010! The two groups, namely households and businesses, that had incentives — ranging from sheer survival to more profit — to push back against the healthcare industry, and that had at least some ability to do so, did. But government entities, subject to special-interest lobbying, went hog-wild. Greatest beneficiary: the healthcare industry. Over the years, it became the largest industry and one of the most powerful lobbies in the country. But 17.9% of GDP may be more than the economy can bear — a glass ceiling of sorts. And healthcare spending has remained stuck there since 2009. Now Congress might weigh in. Further limits on how much Medicare and Medicaid can pay for certain services or medications, or serious efforts to root out waste and fraud, might actually, perhaps for the first time ever, reduce the healthcare industry’s share of the economy — a dreadful thought for the industry. It will do everything in its might to keep that from happening. Now some fodder for the gun-control debate that the horrid events in Connecticut stirred into a frenzy, though it snoozed through the daily drumbeat of murders in Oakland, CA, a few miles across the Bay from me, or in Richmond to the north, or really in any other city. The fodder is inconvenient, however. For both sides of the debate.... How Americans Stack Up In Dying From Violence, War, Suicide, And Accidents.

AP Photo/Newmont MiningGermany is reportedly repatriating gold it has stashed with the New York Fed and the Bank of France, and some policymakers want to bring back all their gold in case the financial crisis worsens. People continue to debate whether gold is or should be considered money. However, this hasn't kept the world's central banks from increasing their gold reserves. The World Gold Council estimates that central banks have purchased 500 tons of gold in 2012, up from 465 tons last year. Analysts attribute some of the support in gold prices to these central bank gold purchases. Global gold reserves increased to 31,575.1 tons as of January 2013. We highlight the ten countries with the biggest official gold holdings as reported by theÂ World Gold Council . We also included the percent of foreign reserves they possess in gold. Note: CBGA refers to the Central Bank Gold Agreements.Â The first Agreement (CBGA 1) ran from September 27, 1999 to September 26, 2004.Â  The second Agreement (CBGA 2) ran from September 27, 2004 to September 26, 2009. The third Agreement (CBGA 3) will run for five years from September 2009.
People have a long and intimate history with coins. Some of us collected them as kids, and we all touch and see them every day. Unlike currency bills, we know intuitively that a coin's value is supposed to come from its metal content. That's why quarters are bigger than dimes.Â Â As a result, most people have viscerally rejected the platinum coin idea. To assign an arbitrary, sky high, valuation to a small piece of metal strikes most people as a deceitful, desperate act. They are right. Â  However, the same people have no problem with images of thousands of crisp paper notes flying off the printing presses. The acceptance is not impacted by how many zeroes the bills contain. People simply believe that paper money derives value from the numbers, not the paper. This was not always so. Paper money originally entered the public awareness as promissory notes to pay different amounts of gold. Once people got used to the paper, few really cared when the gold backing was finally removed. As a result, the public would likely have been much more accepting of the Fed printing a trillion dollar bill than the government minting a trillion dollar coin. But there was no legal pathway for the Fed to simply give that money to the government. Â  The government, not the Fed, mints coins, so they did not have to rely on the Fed to create value out of thin air. That is why the platinum coin idea was so seductive, if ultimately unsellable. Â  But the Fed does the exact same thing all the time using sophisticated accounting and state of the art computing.Â Â The Fed "expands its balance sheet" by buying government bonds from private banks. In exchange for these securities, the Fed credits the banks with funds it creates out of thin air. The banks then pass the funds to the general public through loans.Â Â But it's important to realize that the Fed does not have any money to actually buy the bonds in the first place.Â The funds are "created" by a Fed computer. The process is easier (and equally duplicitous) than minting a trillion dollar coin (which at least requires the production of something other than computer code).Â Â The only difference is the lack of window dressing. It's a shame that the platinum coin episode did not result in a wider recognition of this brutal truth. Â  A similarly silly and meaningless distinction is being made with respect to raising the debt ceiling. In his press conference this week, President Obama said the Republican reluctance to raise the debt limit was the equivalent of a diner who had ordered and enjoyed a meal who then decides to leave the restaurant without paying the bill. The President is actually arguing that if the diner had no cash on hand, it would be much more responsible to simply use a credit card. In taking this moral high ground, the President ignores the fact that the diner (who has indebted himself through habitual restaurant meals) intends to pay his credit card bill with another card, and then repeat the process until he runs out of cards. So in the end, it's not the restaurateur who gets stiffed, but the issuer of the last card the diner is able to acquire. Â As with the platinum coin, this is a distinction without a difference.Â  Â Currently the Federal Government counts more than $16 trillion in funded obligations. Over the next 10 years we are expected to add another $10 trillion or more. At no point in the foreseeable future are we expected to approach balance in our annual budget. All of our future bills are expected to be paid by future borrowing on a massive scale. Anyone with an ounce of integrity would have to plan for the possibility that an ever increasing debt rollover is a limited prospect. Such an understanding will mean that eventually someone will get stuck with the bill. How is this any more responsible than dining and ditching? Â  Â  In truth, a failure to raise the debt ceiling is not a commitment to renege on obligations. It is simply a decision to stop borrowing. The government could still meet obligations by cutting spending, raising taxes, or making reforms to entitlements. But it chooses not to take this difficult step.Â  More important than that is the message America is sending its creditors. By informing them that the United States will not use its taxing power to repay its debts, but will only rely on its ability to borrow more (ironically from the same creditors), it signals its refusal to tackle our fiscal deficiencies through responsible means. It's a shame that more people can't seem to grasp these very simple truths.

Yesterday, Facebook finally entered the search business. Ostensibly, this is great news for Facebook, users, shareholders, customers, and employees, as "search" is one of the most useful and lucrative applications in the digital world. Ever since Mark Zuckerberg took the stage at a conference in November with the stock at $18 and said, yes, of course Facebook would go into search at some point, investors have been on the edge of their seats. And excitement about that new revenue engine, as well as expected acceleration in the core business thanks to Facebook's new mobile products, has driven the stock back up to $30. It is indeed exciting and promising that Facebook has entered this business. But the truth is that Facebook's current beta product is miles from being anything more than a cool, revenue-less feature that some Facebook users might want to play with sometimes. It isn't yet something that is going to be particularly useful. And, importantly, it isn't yet something that will compete with Google for search ad dollars. Our West Coast editor, Owen Thomas, took Facebook's new search engine for a spin yesterday. As you can see here, it's a cool way to search Facebook that takes advantage of the fact that Facebook is a big structured database. And if you're looking for pictures that people have uploaded to Facebook (and made public), or friends who went to a particular school or live in a particular place, or potential mates, it seems quite useful. Beyond that, though, the search engine indexes too little data to be valuable as a commercial discovery engine. One of the immediate commercial uses that everyone began hyperventilating about yesterday, for example, was the hypothetical ability to use Facebook Search to find great restaurants. Everyone would just type in "Indian restaurants my friends like in San Francisco," this theory went, and they'd immediately find the good ones. Yelp would be toast, and all restaurants would immediately start paying Facebook gobs of money for sponsored listings, and so forth. Well, Owen tried a few restaurant queries, too. The results were, to use his word, "awful." Why were they awful? Because Facebook doesn't have enough data about restaurants that Owen's friends like to be truly useful. To have enough data about those restaurants, Facebook would want to go out to the web--to Yelp, to Google, to Zagat's--and begin to incorporate other factors despite just "likes." And Facebook would have to add detailed comments, and pictures, and ratings--the sorts of other structured data that anyone trying a new restaurant would want to know. And Owen's friends would have to eat at, and "like," more restaurants. (It would be nice to think that folks will happily rush to a restaurant because a couple of friends have "liked" it on Facebook, but most Facebook users have used Facebook enough to know that "liking" something doesn't always mean that you actually liked it. And just knowing that someone "liked" something would leave most people wanting more information about it. Furthermore, "likes" will become even less meaningful if Facebook's new search engine suddenly prompts even more companies to pay to get "liked," which is one possible side-effect of the search engine that our Advertising editor Jim Edwards wrote about.) More importantly, Facebook's new search engine has not yet entered the truly lucrative portion of the search business, which is standard online commerce. The truth about Google is that only a small portion of Google search queries produce any revenue. And the ones that produce revenue are generally commerce queries: People looking for specific products to buy. That's the search inventory that advertisers go bananas over. That's the "database of purchase intentions" that has powered Google to a ~$50 billion business. Right now, if you type a typical commerce search query into Facebook's search engine (I'm sorry, but I just can't bring myself to call it by its terrible name, "Graph Search," because no one outside the techo-chamber has any idea what that means), nothing happens. For example, if you type in "Digital cameras that my friends like," you don't get jack. To make Facebook Search useful for that sort of query, therefore, Facebook is going to have to continue to add capabilities to the product. And eventually--and this is the critical step--Facebook is going to have to expand Facebook search to the web. Not just the type and number of products that are indexed in Facebook Search. But the actual search window itself. As Microsoft and many others have made clear, the search business is a scale business: To make your query results relevant, you need a vast number of queries. And to get your search business running well, at a high revenue per search, you also need a vast number of queries--because it is only with this vast number of queries that you can build enough intelligence into the system that you can deliver the right sponsored ad at the right time and, thereby, drive up your revenue and the advertiser's ROI. Google is exceptional at doing that... in part because Google has ~65% of the desktop search market (vastly more, if you include mobile and international) Microsoft has about ~25% of the desktop search market, and this isn't anywhere near enough for Microsoft to make money on search. Microsoft can generate search revenue, but not profit: The amount it spends to generate its queries and traffic more than offsets the lower revenue-per-search that it can generate. Facebook, meanwhile, only has about 2% of U.S. based desktop query share. And the number of commercial queries in Facebook's 2% of queries is likely even proportionally lower. So, to make this a good business--in addition to a truly useful commercial tool--Facebook is going to have to: Bottom line, Facebook Search is a cool new Facebook feature. Lots of people will probably play with it, at least initially--just the way they played with "Siri," when Apple rolled Siri out. (And, as a reminder, when Apple demoed Siri, lots of people said it was going to kill Google. That idea is laughable now.) But for this to be a truly useful product--and, more importantly, a real business--Facebook is going to have to do much more (and much differently) than it has done to date. In other words, the hope that "search" will suddenly radically accelerate Facebook's revenue growth and deliver on the financial hopes and dreams that investors had about the company a couple of years ago remains just that, hope. There's a lot of potential here. But Facebook Search has a long, long way to go before it will ever really matter to anyone.

CNBCTom DeMark, pictured at rightLast night on CNBC, widely-followed market timer Tom DeMark told hosts that the bottom was in for Apple stock, which has been subjected to a vicious selloff over the past several months. DeMark uses a number of indicators for market timing, and he told CNBC they are all aligning strongly in Apple's favor: This is something akin to the low we had December 4 on the Shanghai Index, when we turned positive at the exact low. This looks like a very strong rally of at least 22 percent. We wouldn't be surprised tomorrow to see Apple gap up above $494 or $495, despite trading lower in the after-market today, and then just move forward right from there and be strong for the next couple of weeks and reach $600. We think the low is in...today or tomorrow. DeMark told CNBC that his firm turned bearish on Apple right at the top, and the price action in the stock since then is more or less what they would have expected: On September 21, we turned bearish on Apple, and it was above $700...we made a prediction that the stock would go down to $494 – $494.97, to be precise. We've held to that forecast all the way down, despite those intermittent rallies. What we did see is a freefall decline something akin to what we experienced in July, August of 2011, into the stock market low that ultimately bottomed on October 4. We saw a freefall decline, and typically what we look for is a rally and then a further decline of an equal amount from the prior decline. So in the case of Apple, for example, we declined from about $705 down to $505, and then we rallied up to about $595 or so. If you were to take one half of that prior decline and subtract it from that high, you arrive at $494.50. Sure enough, Apple is bouncing 1.1 percent in pre-market trading. Right now, it's less than a buck below that $494-495 level DeMark was talking about. Click here to watch DeMark's full appearance on CNBC &gt;
On Monday, President Barack Obama said that he wouldn't negotiate with Republicans on the debt ceiling, comparing it to a hostage situation. House Speaker John Boehner immediately shot back, saying the "American people do not support raising the debt ceiling without reducing government spending at the same time." But a new ABC/Washington Post poll suggests that Boehner doesn't have as much leverage on that sentiment as he might think. In the poll, 58 percent of respondents said that the debt ceiling and spending cuts should be kept as separate issues. Only 36 percent thought that spending cuts should be tied to the debt ceiling. Here's a chart from Langer Research, the firm that conducted the poll: Langer Research There are more reasons why this debt-ceiling debate could also be different than last time. Obama is coming off re-election, and he is much more popular than he was in the summer of 2011. During the last debt-ceiling crisis, Obama's approval rating was stuck underwater. Right now, it stands at its highest point since his first year in office (aside from an uncanny bounce after Osama bin Laden's death).  Meanwhile, Congress' approval rating sits at just 19 percent — tied for its lowest since 1975. That's probably why people "trust" the President more to handle raising the debt ceiling and reducing federal debt by a whopping 14-point margin. Here's a chart that shows the continued trend down in Congressional approval: Langer research See why Obama won't let the debt ceiling be used as leverage &gt;

YouTubeEric Rosengren, the head of the Boston Federal Reserve was just on BloombergTV, getting interviewed by Sara Eisen. One of the best parts was where Rosengren was asked if he was worried about the "cost" of all the QE he was doing. We don't have his precise language, but the basic answer was 'I certainly worry, but also worry about the societal cost of high unemployment.' He then exponded on what it meant that unemployment had a big cost. This is a good answer that anyone talking about stimulus should be armed with. Nothing is free, but right now we're paying a huge cost by having people without work. And the longer that festers, the worsse that gets.

Jordan Strauss/Invision/APGood morning. Here's what you need to know.
AP ImagesDimon in 1998JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon took a huge pay cut Â following the "London Whale" trade.Â  His 2012 compensation is $11.5 million, which is half of what he took home for 2011.Â  In an SEC filing the went along with today's earnings report, and an internal investigation into the 'Whale' loss, the firm explained the logic behind Dimon's compensation cut. Basically, it ws a strong year on many fronts, but due to the loss. -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Application in respect of Mr. Dimon. As noted above, the Board took into consideration both the continued strong performance of the Firm (including progress on its long-term strategic priorities, actual financial results, financial performance relative to competitors and qualitative factors) and the CIO losses, including Mr. Dimon's responsibility as the Firm's Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Dimon's leadership and management abilities are reflected in the Firm's overall performance and progress, as reflected in the:  Strength of the Firm's 2012 operating results and financial performance â€¢ Third consecutive year of record net earnings and 15% ROTCEâ€¢ Record net earnings of $21.3 billion, a 12% increase from 2011â€¢ ROE of 11%  â€¢ Record EPS of $5.20 per share, a 16% increase from 2011  â€¢ Common share price increase by 32% in 2012; total return with dividends of 36%  Strong performance of the Firm relative to key competitors  Uninterrupted record of delivering quarterly and annual earnings throughout the financial crisis, subsequent  recession, and CIO losses  Maintenance of a fortress balance sheet  Continued investment in organic growth and the strengthening of the Firm's major businesses  Mr. Dimon also has strengthened the foundation of the Firm's future in leading a reorganization of the Firm's businesses around customer needs by integrating the Chase consumer businesses under the Consumer &amp; Community Banking line of business and the J.P. Morgan Investment Bank and Treasury &amp; Securities Services wholesale lines of business under the Corporate &amp; Investment Bank line of business. As part of this reorganization, he also has developed the succession of a new generation of senior management capable of leading the Firm's businesses and key functions in the future.  With respect to the losses incurred in CIO, the Board views the CIO losses as a serious mistake by the Firm, but believes that one of the marks of a successful company and its leadership is how it addresses its mistakes, learns from them and implements meaningful remedial actions. As Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Dimon bears ultimate responsibility for the failures that led to the losses in CIO and has accepted responsibility for such failures. Importantly, once Mr. Dimon became aware of the seriousness of the issues presented by CIO, he responded forcefully by directing a thorough review and an extensive program of remediation. The Firm:  replaced the CIO senior management responsible for the losses;  took the maximum compensation clawback actions for those most immediately involved;  formed the Management Task Force to review and address the circumstances related to the CIO losses; and  has implemented, or is in the process of implementing, the remedial enhancements noted in the Management Task  Force Report and the recommended improvements set forth in the Board Review Committee Report.  In light of the above considerations, the Board has approved 2012 compensation for Mr. Dimon in the amount of $11.5 million, including salary of $1.5 million (flat with the prior year) and incentive compensation of $10 million, all in the form of restricted stock units (RSUs) (down 53.5% from the prior year). Mr. Dimon's compensation for 2011 was $23 million, including salary of $1.5 million and incentive compensation of $21.5 million (of which $4.5 million was in cash, $12 million was in the form of RSUs, and $5 million was in the form of SARs). The RSUs vest over a period of three years, half after two years and the other half after three years. 
AP ImagesThe nation's largest bank JPMorgan Chase released fourth quarter earnings results this morning.Â  For Q4, JPMorgan delivered EPS of $1.39. Net-income came in at $5.7 billion and revenueÂ came in at $24.4 billion. On average, analysts polled by Bloomberg expected the bank to post $1.19 EPS or an adjusted EPS of $1.217. Net-income for the fourth quarter was expected to come in atÂ $4.82 billion and sales was expected to come in at $24.33 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. JPMorgan's stock was last trading lower in the pre-market. Here's an excerpt from the bank's release:Â  JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM) today reported net income for the fourth-quarter of 2012 of $5.7 billion, compared with net income of $3.7 billion in the fourth quarter of Â 2011. Earnings per share were $1.39, compared with $0.90 in the fourth quarter of 2011. RevenueÂ for the quarter was $24.4 billion, up 10% compared with the prior year. The Firmâ€™s return on tangible Â common equityÂ for the fourth quarter of 2012 was 15%, compared with 11% in the prior year. Net income for full-year 2012 was a record $21.3 billion, compared with $19.0 billion for the prior year. Earnings per share were a record $5.20 for 2012, compared with $4.48 for 2011. RevenueÂ for 2012 was $99.9 billion, flat compared with 2011. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. also announced today that the Firmâ€™s Management Task Force and the independent Review Committee of the Firmâ€™s Board of Directors (the â€œBoard Review Committeeâ€) have each concluded their reviews relating to the 2012 losses by the Firmâ€™s Chief Investment Office (â€œCIOâ€)and have released their respective reports. Both reports are available on the Firmâ€™s website and are discussed at greater length in a Form 8-K filed with the SEC today. Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented on the financial results: â€œFor the third consecutive year, the Firm reported both record net income and a return on tangible common equityÂ of 15%. The Firmâ€™s results reflected strong underlying performance across virtually all our businesses for Â the fourth quarter and the full year, with strong lending and deposit growth. We also maintained our Â leadership positions and continued to gain market share in key areas of our franchise. As we highlightÂ upfront in this release, there were several significant items that affected our results this quarter, but they Â largely offset each other.â€ Dimon added: â€œWe continued to see favorable credit conditions across our wholesale loan portfolios andÂ strong credit performance in our credit card portfolio, where charge-off rates remain at historic lows. The real estate portfolios, while at elevated levels of losses, continued to show improvement as the housing market and economy continued to recover. As a result, we reduced the related allowance for credit losses by $700 million in the fourth quarter and we are likely to continue to see reductions in the allowance as the environment improves.â€ Commenting on the balance sheet, Dimon said: â€œWe strengthened our fortress balance sheet, ending the fourth quarter with a strong Basel I Tier 1 common ratioÂ of 11.0%, up from 10.4% in the third quarter. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. We estimate that our Basel III Tier 1 common ratioÂ was approximately 8.7%Â at the end of the fourth quarter, up from 8.4% in the third quarter.â€ Dimon added: â€œDuring the course of 2012, JPMorgan Chase was able to make more of an impact on our communities than ever before. The Firm provided creditÂ and raised capital of over $1.8 trillion for our Â clients during the year. This included $20 billion for small businesses, up 18%. We also originated more than 920,000 mortgages; provided credit cards to about 6.7 million people; and raised capital and provided creditÂ 1Â of approximately $85 billion for nearly 1,500 not-for-profit and government entities, Â including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities. As part of the 100,000 Jobs Mission, which Â JPMorgan Chase helped launch, since the beginning of 2011, the Firm has hired nearly 5,000 U.S. Â veterans and members of the National Guard and Reserve; and, through our nonprofit partners, we have provided 386 mortgage-free homes for deserving veterans and their families.â€ â€œWe are committed to doing our part to speed the recovery of the housing market. This includes working with struggling homeowners to modify their loans, or pursue other options to allow them to prevent foreclosure. Through these efforts, since 2009, we have offered more than 1.4 million mortgage modifications and completed 610,000 for both loans we own and those we service for others. With respect to Chase-owned mortgages, through modifications and short-sales, we have effectively forgiven more than $10 billion of principal and reduced borrowersâ€™ interest payments by approximately $2 billion. Our efforts are not only helping people, they are also helping set the stage for a recovery in Americaâ€™s housing market, which will ultimately reward our customers, shareholders and communities alike.â€ Dimon concluded: â€œWe are particularly proud that, through the turbulence of recent years, we never stopped serving clients and investing in the future of our franchise âˆ’ opening new offices and branches, adding bankers in key markets, innovating and gaining market share. The capital strength and earnings power of the Firm is as strong as it has ever been, and our 260,000 employees are doing more than everto serve our customers and clients, and support our communities around the world. Challenges still exist, but as we look forward to 2013, we remain optimistic.â€ SEE: Jamie Dimon Gets HUGE Pay Cut Following London Whale Trading Loss &gt;
APDavid Koch With about a month to go before the U.S. hits "the X-date"--the date upon which the government will start to delay or default on payments it has already promised to make--reasonable people on both sides of the aisle are beginning to push back against the group of crazy Republicans in the House of Representatives who are threatening to make the nation default. As Joe Weisenthal observes this morning, former Senator Alan Simpson, a traditional Republican, has joined the fight, pointing out that no true conservative would ever allow the nation to default, because doing so would be fiscally irresponsible: "If youâ€™re a real conservative," Simpson said, "a really honest conservative, without hypocrisy â€“ youâ€™d want to pay your debt." A former Treasury official in the Bush administration, meanwhile, Tony Fratto, has come out to debunk the idea that the country could simply "prioritize payments"--paying China and other Treasury-bond holders their interest, while stiffing federal workers, Medicare recipients, veterans, food stamp recipients, defense contractors, and other people and companies that have been promised money by the U.S. government. The cash flow and payments the Treasury has to manage, Fratto points out, are far too "lumpy" to enable the Treasury to simply pay a few bills and ignore others. (And can you imagine the fight over which bills we should pay?) And now even Americans For Prosperity (AFP), a conservative group backed by the billionaire industrialistÂ  Koch Brothers, is urging the House Republicans not to act so crazy, on the concern that this behavior will turn reasonable Americans against the party and thus reduce its ability to negotiate real spending reforms. Stephanie Kirchgaessner of the FT reports that AFP is telling Republicans to back off on the debt ceiling and focus on spending: â€œWeâ€™re saying calibrate your message. Focus on overspending instead of long-term debt,â€ said Tim Phillips, president of AFP. â€œFocusing on [the debt ceiling] makes the messaging more difficult.â€ There are a lot of reasonable people in this country who support the causes advanced by old-style Republicans and would love to see the U.S. deal with its long-term deficit problem and return to the days of balanced budgets. But there's a big difference between supporting fiscal prudence and threatening to make the country default. Hopefully, over the next month, that message will begin to take hold in Washington.

World markets are all drifting lower, but things really got started off on a negative footing with Japan. The Japanese market has been one of the hottest stock markets in the world, thanks to talk and plans of aggressive financial easing. But the swift downward move in the Japanese yen has evidently spooked some domestic policy makers, to the point where they've suggested that it might be a bit overdone. This talk caused the yen to rally sharply against the dollar, and so the Nikkei (the stock index that has been benefiting from the weak currency) got clubbed. It fell 2.5% last night. 
This is a meme we're picking up more and more: That the market is just getting inured to Washington crises, and doesn't really care. Maybe the market cares for a bit at the last second, but the whole dance has become so cliches, that it's just not worth panicking until you absolutely have to. In a note out this morning, Citi's currency export Steven Englander predicts continued calmness by markets up until the very end. Then horror if it really looks like something isn't going to happen. The title of his note is "First complacency, then horror." Asset market markets are likely to ignore the debt ceiling till the last minute, or even later, and then react on panic if it gets breached. For FX this means that the risk on trade for EM and G10 risk-correlated currencies may have a month or six weeks to go before there is any indication that FX investors are even aware of what is going on in Washington.Â Â Â Â  The reason is that the past three fiscal driven sell-offs have had increasingly little market impact. The July 2011 debt ceiling crises + downgrade led to more than 15% drop in US equities. Right after the November 2012 election we had a bout of fiscal cliff worries that gave us a 5% correction, but when talks broke down in late December, equities barely budged. We suspect investors in FX and other markets have become conditioned to last minute resolutions to US fiscal crises and are increasingly jaded with respect to the political process that will generate the solutions. Hence the tendency will be to hold on to risk even longer on the view that â€˜donâ€™t worry, something will turn upâ€™, just as it has in the past. Dan Greenhaus of BTIG noted the same kind of complacency in his note last night: In more and more client meetings, including two today, the topic of hedging strategies arose around the debt ceiling discussion. To repeat our view, we simply have no idea how the debt ceiling discussions will shake out, nor the discussions surrounding budget negotiations. One thing we can say though is that January VIX futures will tomorrow probably settle at the lowest level since 2007. As the chart below illustrates, volatility has been reduced with each successive macro scare and some clients still tell us not to worry. BTIG

www.flickr.comAlan Simpson was on CNBC yesterday, talking about the debt ceiling. Calculated Risk has his comments. He nails it: Maria Bartiromo: "Do you believe the GOP should be using the debt ceiling as leverage point to get the President to agree to the cuts?"Alan Simpson: "I think that would be a grave mistake. I donâ€™t think that would solve anything. I know they are going to try it, and how far you go with a game of chicken, I have no idea. But I can tell you â€¦ you canâ€™t, you really canâ€™t â€¦ This is stuff weâ€™ve already indebted ourselves. If youâ€™re a real conservative â€“ a really honest conservative, without hypocrisy â€“ youâ€™d want to pay your debt.And thatâ€™s what this is, they are not running up anything new." This is part of a bigger trend: There's a fair amount of outside pressure, even from the right, on conservatives to not take a stand on the debt ceiling. This is something that Ben White, in his Morning Money note, does a great job summarizing today. In addition to Simpson, you have folks like Newt Gingrich and the Koch Brothers saying the same thing, that the debt ceiling isn't the place to take a stand. You also have a fair number of folks, like former Treasury official Tony Fratto, pushing back against the idea that "prioritization" is anything but bonkers. Inside the House GOP, there may be a rising appetite to take it to the limit. Outside the GOP, there's a growing number of folks yelling STOP.
AmazonIt should be another interesting day for Data. Calculated Risk has the scoreboard, and what to watch: â€¢ At 8:30 AM, Consumer Price Index for December. The consensus is for no change in CPI in December and for core CPI to increase 0.1%. â€¢ At 9:15 AM, the Fed will release Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for December. The consensus is for a 0.2% increase in Industrial Production in December, and for Capacity Utilization to increase to 78.5%. â€¢ At 10:00 AM, The January NAHB homebuilder survey. The consensus is for a reading of 48, up from 47 in December. Although this index has been increasing sharply, any number below 50 still indicates that more builders view sales conditions as poor than good.â€¢ At 2:00 PM, the Federal Reserve Beige Book will be released. This is an informal review by the Federal Reserve Banks of current economic conditions in their Districts. In the meantime, stocks are down. And the debt ceiling will still be anyone's talking about.
Since I already provided 5 reasons to remain cyclically bullish I figured Iâ€™d offer the other side of the coin as well. Â Hereâ€™s 6 downside risks via Deutsche Bank: 1. Â US â€“ failure to raise debt ceiling: political deadlock, government shutdown, weak confidence hurts growth. 3. Â Global growth weakens on spill over from a shock in one economic region: e.g., EM lags amid failure to reform, Europe fails to return to growth, slowdown in the US. 4. Â Disorderly sell-off in core rates: concern over excess money printing leads to a bond and risk asset sell-off . 5. Â China â€“ non-performing loans: rising NPLâ€™s on bank balance sheets constrain credit availability and growth. 6. Â Middle East tensions escalate and push up oil prices.
wikimedia commonsMarkets are falling across the board. US futures are down modestly. Europe is down (Italy off 1%, Germany down 0.2%, Spain down 0.6%, France down 0.3%). This all follows a brutal session in Japan where the Nikkei 2.56%. The big story there: A sharp yen strengthening. Investors have been loving the weakening yen, so the snapback here has caught equity by surprise.
Investors recently made a historic move into stocks as the volatility index (VIX) tumbled to a 6-year low. Meanwhile, stocks are sitting at their highest levels since 2007. However, there's something notable about the current trajectory of the S&amp;P 500, which climbed as high as 1,473 on Tuesday. "U.S. S&amp;P rally from low looks spookily similar to 2007," writes SocGen's Albert Edwards in his latest Global Strategy Weekly note. From Edwards' note: Finally a hat tip to Brad Wishak at New Edge.... The same day the Vix fell to 131â„4, the lowest since the zenith of mid-2007 complacency, and the same day the FT reported that equity fund inflows reached levels not seen since mid-2007 -link, Brad shows that the 807 point rally in the S&amp;P from the devilishly worrisome 666 low is exactly the same as the rally from the 2002 low to the mid-2007 peak. Too many coincidences? If you believe history repeats itself, then now's a good time to be worried. Edwards maintains his bearish bias towards the stock market.
â€œThere are decades when nothing happens and there are weeks when decades happen.â€ â€“ Vladimir Ilyich Lenin "People only accept change when they are faced with necessity, and only recognize necessity when a crisis is upon them." â€“ Jean Monnet "If something cannot go on forever, it will stop." â€“Herbert Stein As we begin a new year, we again indulge ourselves in the annual (if somewhat futile) rite of forecasting the year ahead. This year I want to look out a little further than just one year in order to think about the changes that are soon going to be forced on the developed world. We are all going to have to make a very agile adaptation to a new economic environment (and it is one that I will welcome). The transition will offer both crisis and loss for those mired in the current system, which must evolve or perish, and opportunity for those who can see the necessity for change and take advantage of the evolution. This is my most-read letter of the year, by the way, and if youâ€™re not yet a subscriber you can join my â€œone million best friendsâ€ and receive both Thoughts from the Frontline and my other weekly letter, Outside the Box, as well as Grant Williamsâ€™ rollicking Things That Make You Go Hmmmâ€¦, all for free, by simply entering your email address on my site: http://www.mauldineconomics.com/go/bwbsl/MEC Think back to 2001. It was the opening of a new millennium. While that was auspicious enough, several events then ensued that shaped the future for decades to come. China was admitted to the World Trade Organization, leading to a revolution in its production and global trade. The euro was launched with much fanfare â€“ and a minor chorus of criticism. Â We are now in a midst of a great trial that will determine whether the euro will be a brief experiment or a durable currency. This has dramatic implications not only for Europe but for the world. And, of course, the tragic events of 9/11 shaped a new global perception of what constitutes threats to democracy and security.Â  Also as the century opened, a secular bear market had just begun, which diminished returns for retirees. Economic activity in the developed world has yet to recover to the pace of the previous century; and many analysts, as we saw in the last letter for 2012, predict an even slower pace of global growth for the rest of this decade. A fear of deflation prompted Alan Greenspan to lower interest rates to levels that eventually created a housing bubble and encouraged Congress, through lower debt costs, to run up huge deficits prior to the economic collapse of 2008. Since then, our deficit and debt have only gotten worse since. You can read all sorts of economic predictions for this year. Some expect a return to the growth rate of last century and a new bull market. Some see a recession, a major downturn. But no matter what your view of the next 12 months, there is a pervasive sense that the current system of swelling government debt and entitlement promises cannot be sustained. Politicians may persist in kicking the can further down the road, but anyone with third-grade math can see that the system is unsustainable. The US cannot pay an estimated $200 trillion (and growing) in entitlement obligations (Burns and Kotlikoff, The Clash of Generations), although others say that we owe a â€œmereâ€ $80-plus trillion. Japan cannot continue to borrow 45% of its government budget at 1% when debt is at 230 % of GDP and rising over 10% a year. Europe cannot postpone the consequences of an unequal currency union forever. We live in an unsustainable world. To extend the thought of Herb Stein, we must change the world to one that will be more sustainable. Â That has been an implicit theme in this letter for years, but this year it will be an explicit theme that we will visit often. That transition to a more sustainable world is going to involve uncomfortable changes for many, if they do not prepare for it. At the outset, let me state that this â€œunsustainabilityâ€ is not a reference to the Malthusian arguments that the world is running out of food, energy, or the other necessary commodities to insure economic progress for a growing world. I reject those arguments. I have a great deal more faith than that in our ability to transition to new forms of food and energy production. I am in fact quite optimistic about the future of the world. No one will want to go back to the good old days of 2013 in 2033. Our age will seem a quaint time of poor health care (â€œCan you imagine, people died of cancer back in those days?â€), scarcity, and a Â soul-sappingly dreary manufacturing system. The transition we are undertaking to a new world of innovation and technology will be unsettling to many people, but those changes are by and large positive ones, and they will be welcome. As I was finalizing this letter, my friend Barry Ritholtz at The Big Picture sent this note: The deficit scolds have been warning for years that hyperinflation is imminent. I have been hearing these ominous warnings my entire adult life. â€œThis is unsustainable! Inflation is about to explode!â€ But inflation has been rather tame, and we are not experiencing anything remotely like hyperinflation. They keep using that word â€œunsustainable,â€ but with all due respect to Inigo Montoya, I do not think that word means what they think it means. I am definitely in the deficit (and debt!) scold camp, but I give little credence to the US hyperinflation believers. Very different animals. I also believe that we can get the deficit under control if we so choose â€“ or the market may force us to do so. The unsustainability I refer to is that of the largest bubble in human history: government debt in tandem with government promises that cannot be fulfilled. And unlike 1993 when only the developed countries of Canada and Sweden had to deal with unsustainable debt, bloated budgets, and unrealistic promises, this time the bubble countries comprise the largest economies and the majority of global GDP. This is not a short-term matter. There are three distinct economic ecologies that will have to change and will do so on their own timetables. And owing to their size and the significant abilities of a committed establishment to resist change, no matter how inevitable, we are talking years of transition, not months. The economic ecologies I refer to are of course Europe, Japan, and the United States. One could argue that a fourth center of unsustainability exists: China. However, I am not convinced that anything more than the usual garden-variety recessions are in store for China.(Iâ€™m not forecasting Chinese recessions, just pointing out that not even the Chinese can repeal the business cycle forever). We will not get into detail on each of the three economies mentioned but will touch on each. And Iâ€™ll end with a note on where investors should look to make the transition a new era of sustainability. Letâ€™s start with Japan. Back in late November and December I commented in several radio and TV interviews that the title for my annual forecast issue would be â€œThe Year of the Windshield.â€Â  I changed the actual title only recently as I thought more about the upcoming year in its totality, but perhaps the most dramatic shift this year will be that Japan at last begins its descent into that dark night, from the twilight that has been its economy for 20 years. The subtitle comes from my book Endgame, where I whimsically titled a chapter â€œJapan Is a Bug in Search of a Windshield.â€ The problems, which we will look at briefly in a few paragraphs, are well known. Yet Japan has soldiered on, borrowing yet more massive amounts of money, never bringing its budget into line, spending huge amounts on stimulus and infrastructure, and muddling through with an economy that is no bigger today than it was 20 years ago. Japanâ€™s stock market is still down some 75% (give or take) over the last 23 years, though some were celebrating a 23% move last year. Given the frustration that investors have endured from the Nikkei over that time, I suppose you take solace when and where you can. The chart below is current as of this week. You can get more details on the index performance over the last two decades at http://www.forecast-chart.com/historical-nikkei-225.html. Mauldin Economics Japan now has a breathtaking 230% ratio of government debt to GDP (the last estimate I have seen), and it is growing at 10%-plus a year. The government will borrow almost 45% of its budget this year. Has there ever been a more clear disaster in the making? Yet shorting the Japanese bond has been called â€œthe widow-maker.â€ I think it was Soros who once quipped that you canâ€™t call yourself a global macro trader until you have lost money shorting JGBs (Japanese government bonds). The new Japanese government, led by Prime Minister Abe and former Prime Minister and now Minister of Finance Aso, have very explicitly demanded that the Bank of Japan target 2% inflation. They have made clear their intention to replace the governors of the current BoJ board with members who agree with this policy. They have the political clout to do so. Whether at the upcoming meeting or after April, when a new head of the BoJ is appointed, that is going to happen. These moves mean there will be a massive printing of yen. In response, the yen has already weakened by over 10%. You can control the quantity of money or the price of money but not both. (Yes, I know that one influences the other, but I am referring here to large-scale printing of money.) One has to assume that the law of gravity will not be repealed and that investors will want something more than 2% on the ten-year bond if inflation is at 2%. If the ten-year bond were to rise by 2%, Japan would soon be spending over 50% of its tax revenues on the interest carry alone. I submit that this is not a workable business model. Why now and not sometime during the past ten years? I see a number of factors coming together this year: 1.Â Â Â Â Â  The Japanese had a 15%+ savings rate in 1990. That is now down below 1%. (Exact numbers are difficult, because Japanese data on this topic has severe lags, and thus my number is an extrapolation but a reasonable one, I think.) Due to the nature of their retirement system, they have channeled the vast bulk of these savings into JGBs. When the savings rate goes negative or is no longer sufficient to buy all the issued debt, the choice will be to monetize the debt or cut spending. The latter choice does not appear to be part of their national conversation. Cutting spending by the amount required will mean a serious recession and further deflation, an option the new government explicitly rejects. 2.Â Â Â Â Â  Both the trade deficit and the current account have recently turned negative. The vaunted Japanese export machine seems to have hit a wall, and this will limit options in controlling the price of the yen, even if the government wants to. Understand,Â  inflation targeting is also currency-valuation targeting. They clearly want the yen to devalue. I have been writing for years that the yen would eventually be 125, then 150, then 200 to the dollar. It has been 300 in my lifetime, and unless the Japanese change direction, there is no reason it canâ€™t get there again. This means that Mrs. Watanabe will see her energy bills double. This will call into question the Japanese decision to close their nuclear energy plants â€“ something that Abe is already reconsidering. Think the Koreans will be happy when you can buy a Lexus cheaper than you can buy a Kia? (Disclosure: I love my Japanese Infiniti, the first â€œforeignâ€ car I have bought, except for a two-month dalliance with a disaster of a Volkswagen 30 years ago.) Think Samsung and LG will be happy when Panasonic and Sony can eat their lunch pricewise? Welcome to the era of real currency wars. Today this note is worth about $11. In the future? Not so much. Wikimedia Commons Japan is now committed to either Disaster A or Disaster B. Remember those really bad Japanese â€œhorrorâ€ movies of the â€™50s and â€™60s? Godzilla first released in 1954, and there were dozens of remakes and follow-on movies. It seemed endless. And while the current government policy will not trash downtown Tokyo, it will seriously damage the savings and buying power of two generations. Disaster A is monetization, which is clearly not good when the Japanese want to buy anything not made in Japan (like energy, steel, commodities, a lot of food, etc.) Disaster B is the deflationary depression that budget balancing will yield. Which leads us to the next factor: 3.Â Â Â Â Â  Once the government is committed to the new strategy, any retreat will cause a market upheaval. This is not a short-term commitment. It seems to me that the Japanese truly believe that their lack of economic growth can be solved through inflation. Their politicians seem to be channeling their inner Paul Krugman, or at the least taking Bernankeâ€™s advice from 2000, when he published a paper called â€œJapanâ€™s Slump: A Case of Self-Induced Paralysis?â€ When your debt and deficit are as massive as Japanâ€™s, the only way to resolve the issue is to inflate away the debt or willingly enter into a depression. They obviously think they can control both the debt and inflation. This means you should NOT run out and short Japanese government bonds. Repeat, NOT. The only way for the Japanese to make their plan work without having to battle the Godzilla of a destitute bond market is for the BoJ to move out the yield curve and monetize the debt. They will eventually hit all bids on JGBs. For all intents and purposes, the BoJ will become the yen bond market. You will get all the yen they promised when you bought those bonds â€¦ but the contract never stipulates what those yen will actually buy. The plan is evidently that, with a little inflation, they will jump-start the economy; and with growth they can eventually balance the budget and return to a normal bond market. Rots of ruck, guys. Just a couple years ago this letter seemed as if it was All Greece, All the Time. Since Japan is, say, about 100 times more important than Greece, we will be revisiting it at length in the coming months. But before we move on,three notes: First, some full disclosure. Even though I have been suggesting that Japan is a â€œbug in search of a windshieldâ€ for almost three years, I have not actually put any money on the table. Until this month. I have now invested a sizeable portion of my pension funds into a short Japan strategy (not simply a short yen and clearly not a short JGB strategy) and will increase that position as time goes on. This is going to be a long-term trade, so no need to rush out and short the yen this morning. Please donâ€™t. Think about this. There is little difference between 90 yen to the dollar and 100 yen, with a target of 200 or more â€“ at least if I am right. If I am wrong, which is quite possible, then the name â€œwidow-makerâ€ will once again be appropriate. I am not suggesting that you do anything, just start your investigation. I will be writing more soon. And for the record, I will be putting this trade on slowly, because the yen market and the Nik kei have moved a lot already. I think this may be one of the most asymmetrical trades I have seen, but this will require endurance, not speed.. Second, the results of this whole Japanese central bank kabuki theater piece will serve as a warning to other governments (especially the US Fed and Congress) not to attempt to reproduce this strategy. Right now, though, it seems to them like a good idea. And this is precisely the policy urged by Paul Krugman. Conveniently, Japan is getting ready to conduct a massive experiment based on Krugmanâ€™s ideas. While Krugman has only his reputation on the line, there are 127 million Japanese who have real skin in the game. If Krugman does not think that monetization is appropriate, he should publicly say so now. No Monday-morning quarterbacking allowed. And since I am in Spain tonight, I request that he show some huevos. Go explicitly on the record. It would be nice to know just how much monetization Krugman thinks is enough. At what point should the Japanese stop? Four percent inflation? Six percent? 200 yen to the dollar? 250 or 300? Should they continue until the economy is growing at 2%? 4%? How should they then withdraw from monetary stimulus? Will withdrawal cause a recession when they do? Do deficits matter at all? Is there a theoretical limit to monetization and stimulus if the economy is sputtering? Of if withdrawal of monetary stimulus is likely to cause a recession and economic hardship, should it be continued past â€œnormalâ€ bounds? What are those boundaries? If the Japanese strategy (as I think I understand it) is successful, then I will have to lay my right hand on a copy of the General Theory and convert to the gospel according to John Maynard Keynes, as interpreted by his disciple Paul Krugman. If the facts change then I suppose I must change, too. But the jury is out on this one. The world will be watching. And finally I should note, all humor aside, that I recognize this is not a B-grade disaster movie. This is as real as it gets for Japan and its people. The Japanese are hard-working and clearly brilliant business people. They are not doomed. They will be forced to adapt, but they have done this before, as have many countries. I wish them well, I truly do. Four years ago I wrote about Greece, and two years ago I wrote about Spain (in detail in Endgame). I was early both times. I was looking at the math of their budgets and only saw the numbers, staring me in the face. For the record, France is on its way to becoming the new Greece. Not in the same way, of course: France will blaze its own path to economic chaos. Hollande seems to have a good mental map for that journey and a good head start. I am early again, but unless something very new and different unfolds, the die is cast. If Greece causes heartburn for European politicians, what will economic chaos in France mean? There seems to be no polite word for even a soupÃ§on of austerity in the French language. The French are not going to meet their budget forecasts. They will lose their AAA rating, which they will claim is a conspiracy against them and completely unjustified. And when their interest rates climb by 2% they will demand that the ECB buy their debt, just as the ECB is doing for Spain and Italy. Watch the screaming when their rates climb above 4%. We will be told, â€œFour percent is clearly a temporary lack of market understanding and simply not rational.â€ It is going to be interesting to watch how the Socialist government of Hollande tries to maneuver in the coming months and years. Will they try to cut spending? Where? Agricultural subsidies? Pensions? Move retirement (temporarily, of course) back to 62? (Zut alors!) Try and force the economy to grow with more deficit spending and borrowing and hope the ECB intervenes? Will French workers and farmers quietly accept austerity? Will Germany want to subsidize France? Is France a bridge too far for European solidarity? Stay tuned. Paris was recently ranked as the most expensive city to live in. I can attest that the city is trop cher. I must admit that Paris is one of my favorite places in the world, especially in spring. I love going to my friend Bill Bonnerâ€™s place in Ouzilly, in the deep countryside of France. It is extraordinary. The only good thing that will come out of this debacle the French government is creating is that Paris is going to get a whole lot cheaper. Well, that and the total discrediting of socialist policy. Europe has its own sustainability issues, which I have chronicled in the past, and we will of course visit them again. This will be a source of serious volatility in the coming year. In my opinion 2013 is a make or break year for the US. If we are going to get the deficit on a glide path to balance, then it needs to happen this year. (I should note I have been saying 2013 since 2010.) 2014 is an election year, and it will be muy difÃ­cil to get anything of substance done then. Will Obama be any more willing to compromise in 2015? At that point I think it is too late and the bond market, having watched Japan and France and much of Europe descend into chaos, will simply begin to demand higher rates, no matter what the Fed does. If it doesnâ€™t happen even sooner. This American fiscal issue is first of all going to mean crisis after crisis if the Republicans are serious at all about the deficit. Will they blink, or will they allow the government to shut down? It was shut down twice in the 1990s. The world survived. I wish we had a more collegial system. Who knew we would be nostalgic for the era of Clinton and Gingrich? Again, this letter is getting long and we all know the problems. I will write more on all this in future letters. But before we leave the issue, let me offer a suggestion to House Republicans and some thoughts on the unsustainability of entitlements. First, let me humbly suggest that the House pass two budgets. Not one, two. First, pass one that assumes that current tax policy remains intact, but that puts us on a glide path to a balanced budget in seven years. Then pass one with the same goal but with sweeping, pro-growth tax reform. Like a 15% corporate tax but no deductions for anything. Total elimination of tax expenditures. Maybe get crazy and substitute a VAT for the Social Security tax. No halfway measures. Get radical. Then send both budgets to the Senate with a note that says you will be glad to vote to extend the debt ceiling for a period of time, when they pass a budget the president will sign. After all, they have 55 Democratic senators. They do control the Senate. They have not passed a constitutionally mandated budget for three years. Whatâ€™s to think they can pass anything? Stop negotiating with yourselves and make them put something on the table that the president publicly agrees with. The debt ceiling then becomes the problem of the Senate and the president. They can get an increase any time they pass a budget that they can find just five Republicans to vote for. It doesnâ€™t have to be one of your two options, but it does have to be something that is public. The Senate is supposed to be where compromises happen. So let them compromise, and then and only then sit down to talk. In the meantime pass true immigration reform. Go the extra mile on this one. It is good policy and good politics. Pass any House Democratic proposal that makes even a little sense. Show some true bipartisanship. And no negotiating on the budget until the Senate passes a bill that Obama will sign. Then get serious and get it done. A few final thoughts on the US. The tax increases are going to add up to more than advertised in the mainstream media, perhaps as much as 1.5% of GDP. This is not going to make for a robust first half. A quarter or two of outright recession is quite possible. At the least, growth will be very weak. And the hidden tax of increased healthcare insurance costs as a result of â€œObamacareâ€ will be more than 1% in the latter half of 2013, as insurance companies adjust to rising mandates and costs in 2014. Insurance companies are announcing major increases in premiums. My own company healthcare costs are up an eye-shocking amount. And for labor-intensive businesses? Workers are going to be left to the tender mercies of the new healthcare system. Obamacare is going to be the mother of all bureaucratic nightmares to implement. I am in sympathy with the need for change in the healthcare system, but how we think we can radically adjust 15% of the US economy with no collateral damage to it is beyond me. On top of the tax increases, Obamacare will mean a very lackluster year for the US economy. One of the things foremost in my mind is the unsustainability of entitlements, especially healthcare. We all know that Social Security can be resolved rather quickly, but healthcare is going to be difficult. Not the least of the problems is that Americans live manifestly unhealthy lifestyles. Data suggests we are actually 40% sicker than our European counterparts, which explains why healthcare costs so much more here in terms of GDP. Further, healthcare policy was formed in an era of big business and labor unions, and that time is passing. As I was discussing this with Pat Cox tonight, he mentioned that Michael Barone used nearly those exact words in his op-ed today. I stopped and read it and found myself nodding in agreement. He noted a repeating 76-year cycle in American politics (only modestly forced) that suggests a new era is upon us. Not too far off from Neil Howeâ€™s Generations cyclical thesis. You can read the whole column here. Let me quote from the ending: The original arrangements in each 76-year period became unworkable and unraveled toward its end. Eighteenth-century Americans rejected the Colonial status quo and launched a revolution, then established a constitutional republic. Nineteenth-century Americans went to war over expansion of slavery. Early-20th-century Americans grappled with the collapse of the private-sector economy in the Depression of the 1930s.We are seeing something like this again today. The welfare state arrangements that once seemed solid are on the path to unsustainability. Entitlement programs â€“ Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid â€“ are threatening to gobble up the whole government and much of the private sector, as well. Lifetime employment by one big company represented by one big union is a thing of the past. People who counted on corporate or public-sector pensions are seeing them default. Looking back, we are as far away in time today from victory in World War II in 1945 as Americans were at the time of the Dred Scott decision from the First Inaugural. We are as far away in time today from passage of the Social Security in 1935 as Americans then were from the launching of post-Civil War Reconstruction. Nevertheless our current president and most politicians of his party seem determined to continue the current welfare state arrangements â€“ historian Walter Russell Mead calls this the blue-state model â€“ into the indefinite future. Some leaders of the other party are advancing ideas for adapting a system that worked reasonably well in an industrial age dominated by seemingly eternal big units into something that can prove workable in an information age experiencing continual change and upheaval wrought by innovations in the market economy. The current 76-year period is nearing its end. What will come next? I can see multiple paths, but all must inevitably lead to some form of sustainability. Avoid the rush. Go ahead and begin adapting now! By the end of this decade and probably much sooner we will have transformed the unsustainable current system into something more manageable. The secular bear market will have ended. Healthcare and medicine are due for a radical upgrade, and science-fiction-like technologies await. The new era (I am searching for a name to call it) will be most welcome if you make plans to transition from where we are to where we are going. And this letter will chronicle the journey. Stay with me. For those of you who are interested in alternative investments to address the kinds of challenges weâ€™ve covered here, Iâ€™ve written a piece on the global macro environment, which you can access at http://www.altegris.com/MauldinGlobalMacro. (In this regard I am president and a registered representative of Millennium Wave Securities, LLC, member FINRA.) London, Athens, Geneva, Toronto, and New York I am in the Costa del Sol of Spain tonight, where I decided to spend the weekend talking to the locals and exploring. Tuesday I fly to London for meetings and a rather cool gathering that is one of my favorite things to do: a dinner with interesting people. Then I fly off to Athens where I will meet Christian Menegatti, the managing director of research at Roubini Global Economics. We are going to spend three days meeting with business leaders, politicians, bankers, and just regular people, getting a feel for whatâ€™s happening on the ground. Drop a note if you want to meet later in the evenings at my hotel in Athens. All that, coupled with what I learned as the guest of Skagen Funds in our tour of Scandinavia, will be the topic of next weekâ€™s letter, which I will write from Geneva, amidst meetings with clients. (Which is why I stayed in Europe rather than going back to Texas just to return to Switzerland a few days later. And this â€œtour of dutyâ€ does not exactly amount to hardship.) I will be in Toronto on January 28 for a speech with my Canadian partner, Nicola Wealth Management. Lots of media (times later) and meetings with long-time friend Rick Rule and Sprott Management. And of course a lengthy confab with Rosie (David Rosenberg). I will learn a lot, I am sure. Then itâ€™s on to NYC on the 29th and possibly DC later that week before returning home for a time. You gotta love it. I was in Sweden speaking to about 200 investors and money managers (lots of pension money) for Skagen Funds over lunch last Friday. Sweden, as noted above, went through its own crisis in 1993. I have talked with many Swedes involved in the markets at the time. I have not met anyone who enjoyed it, although when I asked that question during lunch I did see one person raise his hand. I found out later that he was a government bond trader. I also asked, â€œDid anyone here propose in 1988 anything resembling what eventually became the difficult compromises of 1993?â€ I saw no hands raised this time. And if the US does not make the difficult choices today, then we will be forced to make disastrous choices not very far down the road. Taxes will be raised and healthcare and other spending cut far more than any of us can imagine. That is the time-honored pattern, and there is no reason to think the US is any different. It is very early in the morning and time to hit the send button. Have a great week. I will take notes and report back to you.
