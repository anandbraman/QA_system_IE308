Feng Li/Getty ImagesA month ago, China announced property curbs including a 20 percent capital gains tax on home sales, that slammed Chinese stocks, and property stocks in particular. Now, a bunch of local Chinese governments including Beijing and Shanghai have announced a follow-up to those measures. First, here's a look at the announcements, via Xinhua. Big cities will carry out the 20 percent capital gains tax on property sales. Beijing Shanghai Chongquing These property curbs are thought to be lacking in specifics, and inadequate in cooling home prices. Bank of America's Ting Lu writes that these follow-up measures are less strict than the markets had expected.  In terms of the policies for both cities, he writes that Beijing's restriction on home purchases is a bit of a surprise. Beijing however accounts for 4.5 percent of China's new home sales and therefore the "impact will be quite limited." Moreover, many of the smaller cities like Hefei and Dalian didn't even mention the 20 percent tax. From Lu: "The 'detailed measures' announced by local government this weekend reflect a tug-of-war between the local and central government (especially the previous one). Under China’s tax system, local governments get only 40% of capital gains tax on home sales but will bear the full brunt of falling land sales and other property-related tax, so they have little incentives in implementing overly restrictively property tightening measures including the 20% capital gain tax. We will perhaps have to wait for more details on 20% capital gain tax from the State Tax Bureau." He expects that new home sales won't see a huge impact from these measures and existing home sales already surged in March to avoid the tax, these should slow in April.  The governments preferred method of lowering home prices seems to be through increasing land supply as we have previously reported. Chinese property stocks seem to be celebrating the news, with the SHPROP rising as much as 2.43 percent today.
CNBCSBS/CNBC's Chery KangSo, the whole world seems to have dismissed North Korea's Friday declaration of war on South Korea. Even reporters based in Seoul — which is around 120 miles from Pyongyang — seem pretty blase. CNBC's Chery Kang, who is based in Seoul, was asked via satellite by a CNBC World colleague how South Korea and its markets were responding. "Working in a newsroom in Seoul, South Korea, it certainly does not feel like I'm living in a country that is in a state of war," responded Kang very casually. Business Insider has spoken to other South Koreans who share this very sentiment. Kang continued to say that South Korea does "take threats seriously, even though they come nearly everyday." Indeed, according to Korea's Yonhap News Agency, South Korea's President Park has pledged a "strong response" to North Korea's "provocation." South Korea's stock market opened a few hours ago and they are down only modestly. Losses have largely been attributed to disappointing trade numbers. "Unacceptable" Late Friday evening, North Korea said in a statement that it had entered war with South Korea. "Situations on the Korean Peninsula, which are neither in peace or at war, have come to an end," said North Korea in a statement.  The also said that U.S. stealth bomber flights over South Korea were an "unacceptable" provocation, and that this was a "final warning" to the U.S. However, U.S. officials quickly responded and said this was just an extension of North Korea's "long history of bellicose rhetoric and threats." While any threat of war certainly is scary, North Korea has certainly solidified its position as the world's "boy who cried wolf." Thanks to CNBC's Deirdre Wang Morris for helping with quotes.
Chinese property stocks are up after the follow-up measures announced by local governments ended up being less strict than markets had expected.

AP Photo/Kin CheungHSBC China PMI climbed to 51.6 in March, right in line with expectations. Click here to refresh &gt; This is up from 50.4 in February, but down marginally from the Flash reading of 51.7 March. A look at the sub-indices showed that production levels increased for the fifth-straight month. The increase in manufacturing output was driven by "solid growth of total new orders".Â  Inventories of finished goods rose for the first time in six months and this was driven by increased production fueled by an increase in demand. "China's recovery continues, mainly driven by the gradually improving domestic demand conditions," wrote Hongbin Qu, chief economist for China at HSBC in a press release. "The decline in input prices suggests a modest pace of demand recovery moderating inflationary pressures. This, plus the lingering external headwinds, implies the Beijing policy makers should keep a relative accommodative policy stance in place." This report follows the official manufacturing PMI report, which climbed to 50.9 in March. One of the key differences between the two reports are the survey size. The National Bureau of Statistics PMI survey looks at responses of 3,000 companies in 21 industries. This compares with about 430 companies surveyed by HSBC.

Moments ago, we got two key pieces of economic data. Japan's Tankan survey, a measure of business sentiment, was disappointing across the board. South Korea's exports, the economic canary in the coal mine, climbed by just 0.4 percent, which was far short of expectations for a 1.8 percent gain. Later, China will be publishing its March manufacturing PMI reports.
Wikimedia CommonsSouth Korean trade data was just released. March exports climbed by just 0.4 percent year-over-year. This was well short of the 1.8 percent increase forecasted by economists. Click Here For Updates &gt; Sure, it's a cliche.Â  But economists across Wall Street dub South Korean exports as the global economic canary in the coal mine. Korean trade dataÂ usually comes before the first trading session of the month in Asia, which makes it the first of the world's major economic indicators to be released. Because Korea's exports are heavily exposed to China and Japan â€” the world's second and third largest economies â€” it is considered to have strong predictive power. Below is a chart from Morgan Stanley's Joachim Fels. It shows how Korean exports are a leading indicator for global trade. Morgan Stanley
St Stev / FlickrThe Q1 results of Japan's Tankan survey were just released. The large manufacturers index improved to -8 from -12 in the previous report. However, this was a bit short of the -7 expected. The non-manufacturers index improved to 6 from 4 last quarter.  This too fell short of expectations. The outlook reports for both sectors were also disappointing. This report reflects sentiment among Japan's largest companies. A positive number reflects optimism.

AP ImagesKim Il SungThe idea that someone would buy goods from or invest in North Korea is likely to outrage some people as the transactions would probably directly or indirectly finance the controversial government. But that's exactly what legendary commodities investor Jim Rogers is doing. Bloomberg's Sara Eisen pointed us to a Wall Street Journal story explaining Rogers' rationale: Mr. Rogers, who started the Quantum Fund with George Soros in the 1970s, couldn't be reached for comment, but had said in a previous interview: "Coins and stamps are the only way I can invest in North Korea." By invest in, Mr. Rogers means he wants to wager against the long-term prospects for the isolated, economically struggling country. He views his purchase as a bet on the collapse of North Korea. "At some point down the line, North Korea will cease existing as a country. Then the value of the coins will go up," Mr. Rogers said. So, Rogers believes he is shorting North Korea. The Journal reports that a total of 13 one-ounce coins were purchased by an assistant of Mr. Rogers at a coin fair in Singapore.Â  The price was around $2,014 a piece.

Milos Bicanski/Getty ImagesWell, this might be our first market quote of how much a "Cypriot Euro" is worth. Remember, last week after large depositors in Cyprus were haircutted, and the government instituted capital controls to prevent money from fleeing, a number of economists argued that Cyprus essentially had its own currency the Cypriot Euro. If you can't easily move your money out of a Cypriot bank account, then said euros are worth less than the same nominal account in, say, a German bank. So how much less is a Cypriot Euro worth than a regular euro? Maybe 20% less From Peter Spiegel at FT: Sergei Tyulenev, a Russian businessman, says he received a call on Thursday – the day the capital controls were implemented – from Cypriots he did not wish to identify offering to help him move what he implied was more than €1m out of a collapsing local bank. ... There was a catch though, on top of the illegality of the move. “They said I had to pay €200,000 up front. I refused,” said Mr Tyulenev, speaking from Limassol, a town dubbed “Limassolgrad” for its high proportion of Russian residents. Meanwhile, at airports, authorities are finding attempts by people to remove tons of cash from the country, in violation of the law. Read the full report here &gt;
Know what this is? Henry Blodget / Business Insider It's one of the first mass-produced mini-computers--the PDP 8.Â  The PDP-8 was made by Digital Equipment Corporation in 1965. It cost $18,000. It was much less powerful and vastly harder to use than a cheap smartphone is today. The PDP-8 and similar machines made Digital Equipment Corporation the leader in the mini-computer revolution. Mini-computers provided a vast price-performance-and-usage improvement over mainframes, so they quickly took over the corporate computing world. Digital Equipment Corporation, meanwhile, became one of the world's most dominant technology companies. For two decades, the company's stock soared. Nothing would ever stop Digital Equipment Corporation. When the personal computer appeared, DEC's founder famously ridiculed it. No one, Ken Olsen said, would ever want a computer in their home. You know what happened next. A couple of decades later, in the late 1990s, Compaq bought what was left of DEC. Then Compaq itself collapsed and was acquired by HP. Some remnants of DEC still exist within HP, which is itself now collapsing. Microsoft, the company that rode the wave that supplanted mini-computers, is now, if not collapsing, struggling. (Ironically, after a couple of decades of challenges, the company that led the pre-mini-computer mainframe wave, IBM, has completely retooled itself and is now back to being dominant.) This PDP-8 above, meanwhile, is now in the London Science museum. The moral of the story? Technology changes fast. Today's world-beater is often tomorrow's Digital Equipment Corporation. The companies that lead one wave rarely go on to lead the next.
The “make fast cash flipping houses” ads are back in force, construction is resurgent, consumers are walking around with shopping bags again, “mom &amp; pop investors” are raising their 401k contributions, and US equities have healed their financial crisis wounds, rising to all-time highs. Animal spirits are also on the rise. You can see it. You can feel it in your bones. People are starting to feel confident, rappers are rapping about the “down economy,” and the mainstream media has finally caught onto the fact that the stock market isn’t going to zero. Instead, it looks like it’s going to infinity. CEO.ca CEO.ca CEO.ca I have a sneaking suspicion that equities and high-yield credit are approaching bubble territory, but the market gods are the ultimate arbiters on that. What I am confident about is that we’re in the midst of a bubble in the “cash is trash” investor mindset. According to the transitory bubble theory, we know that at any given moment, there’s going to be a bubble brewing somewhere. And with each bubble, a set of conventional wisdom and “market mantras” evolve. For example, during the 2005-2007 credit bubble, we were subjected to tropes like: “The world is awash in liquidity.” “Subprime is contained.” “Soft landing in US housing.” “The BRICs have decoupled from the US.” We later learned these mantras — and the conventional wisdom of this market period — were unanimously wrong. Consider also the 2008-2009 financial crisis, when analysts began using expressions like: “Cash is king.” “Bathtub bottom.” “Stock up on canned food, silver bars, bottled water, guns, and ammo.” “Commercial real estate won’t come back for at least a decade.” “An entire generation of investors has permanently left the stock market.” And today, with the Dow, S&amp;P 500, and Russell 2000 all at nominal all-time highs, the cliches circulating are: “Cash is trash.” “Equities are the only game in town.” “Cash in a savings account is useless.” “The Fed has your back” OR “The Fed is underneath you.” “Central banks have removed tail risk from markets.” I could go on, but you get the point: the “cash is trash” mantra’s essentially taking investor psychology by force. The Fed has perhaps been the primary player perpetuating this disrespect, pretty much scoffing at any mention of holding significant cash. And rising equity prices and a solid upturn in housing prices have fanned the flames. Why make 1% in a savings account, when you can easily make 10-15% by investing in a home or raising your 401k contribution? This investor psychology is made even more attractive by the pervasive idea that “the Fed has your back,” and wants you to make money by investing in equities and real estate. There’s definitely truth to the above logic. But bubbles begin when a sound fundamental premise is taken to wild extremes by throngs of over-exuberant investors. In February 2009, for example, the conventional wisdom that “cash was king” turned out to be EXACTLY WRONG — the vast majority of investors were figuratively cowering in their bunkers, clinging to soup cans and stacks of hundred dollar bills that they would have been better off investing in highly depressed equities and residential real estate. And so it’s my view that investors today are just as poorly positioned as they were in early 2009. The only difference is that instead of cash being king, cash is now trash. The pendulum has swung 180°, from extreme risk-aversion to extreme risk-taking. Cash offers optionality and flexibility where being fully invested makes you vulnerable to the whims of the market. Rising markets tend to convince short-sighted investors that the preceding period’s gains will continue indefinitely. And the fear of missing out in an environment of rising asset prices leads investors to “chase” investment opportunities and make irrational decisions. It’s no different now. As we enter the second quarter of 2013, virtually all risky assets are riding high. Even bitcoins (a digital pseudo-currency) bask in the glow of “cash is trash” fervor. However, as astute students of market history, we know that the times we need to be most vigilant are the times when everything seems so easy, when everyone’s drinking the Kool-Aid. Currently, I prefer raising cash exposure and reducing equity and high-yield debt exposure as much as possible. Increasing one’s cash position will significantly lower overall portfolio beta at a time when the vast majority are amping their beta up. Cash also allows flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they arise. Here’s a chart that should make astute market participants think twice about adding long-equity exposure right now: CEO.ca   At a time when most equity investors believe they can’t lose, I find it difficult to see how they can win, except in the very near term, or in specific situations. The early warning signs of inflation are becoming evident: real estate prices are picking up, landlords are raising rents for the first time in over five years, there’s been no slack in rising food prices, and people are spending money, which inevitably drives up the price of goods and services. There has never been a situation in history in which extraordinarily accommodative central bank monetary policy combined with surging asset prices did not lead to higher (oftentimes much higher) levels of inflation. In fact, we’re seeing it happen in China right now. China experienced a stock market bubble that popped in late-2007. Its government responded with massive stimulus and highly accommodative polices, which caused the stock market bubble to transition into an epic property bubble. China has now found itself combating the simultaneous combination of high consumer price inflation, a property bubble, a decelerating economy, and highly uneven wealth distribution. By any estimation, the Fed ‘unwind’ will either be extremely difficult or flat-out impossible. Even if inflation should tick up to uncomfortably high levels, the Fed is most likely to respond by simply pausing its accommodative policy efforts and allowing its balance sheet to shrink by refraining from replacing maturing securities. Of course, even a gradual backing away from policy accommodation by the Fed will present huge headwinds for both the economy and markets – investors are likely to wonder what’s next and be dissatisfied with any answers they might be able to come up with. Rising inflation expectations are also likely to lead to higher long-term bond yields, which will mean higher real interest rates. Higher rates and steeping real rate term structure will by definition lead to falling asset prices as investors raise the discount rate with which they value future cash flows. Of course, it’s possible the Fed will expand its balance sheet another few trillion dollars while asset prices surge even higher and inflation remains subdued. But the chances of this happening are pretty low. What was that Keynes quote about market remaining irrational? CEO.ca   Investors may be on the verge of realizing that just when they’re thinking they can’t lose, they really need to look just over the horizon to see that almost the exact opposite is true. While equities and other risky assets such as high-yield corporate bonds and leveraged loans may continue to percolate just a bit longer, any additional gains are likely to be fleeting once investors’ begin to appreciate the enormity of their misperception. I really like the optionality and relative safety of US dollar cash. I also recommend relative value pairs trades such as:
Anyone interested in the ongoing argument about whether it's better to confront the weak economy with "austerity" or "stimulus" should keep an eye on the United Kingdom. Since the financial crisis, in the United States, we have pursued a mixed approach--some stimulus, some austerity. Our economy is gradually recovering, but at a disappointing rate. Under the leadership of Prime Minister David Cameron, meanwhile, the UK has charged down the "austerity" path... cutting government spending and raising taxes on poor people in an attempt to reduce the deficit. The goal of this policy has been to cut the national debt and restore "confidence" among businesses and consumers--with the theory being that the economy is weak because businesses and consumers are getting worried about the nation's debt load. Well, at least so far, the austerity policies have been a disaster. Four years after the financial crisis, the performance of the UK's economy has been much worse than that of the US economy. In fact, the UK is teetering on the edge of a triple-dip recession. Shockingly, the UK's economic recovery has been even weaker than the recovery of its economy during the Great Depression. St. Louis FedWhat's more, despite the spending cuts, the UK's deficit has shrunk only modestly since the financial crisis. It's still running at greater than 7.5% of GDP! (See chart at right). The UK's experience, in other words, reveals the big flaw in the "austerity" approach, one that economists like Paul Krugman frequently point out: You can't cut your way to prosperity. Cutting spending to reduce deficits in a weak economy weakens the economy even further. The weakening economy then produces less tax revenue. So whatever deficit shrinkage is gleaned from the spending cuts is neutralized by the lower tax revenue. This is the spiral that Greece and other weak European economies have fallen into in the last few years. The UK is about to launch into another round of policies designed to cut the deficit--this time driven by tax cuts for the rich and tax hikes and spending cuts on the poor. Not surprisingly, except among rich folks, these policies aren't going over well. I was in London yesterday, so I walked over to the Prime Minister's house on Downing Street to see what was going on. What was going on was a minor protest. Some Britons, anyway, are annoyed enough about what David Cameron is doing to the economy that they're happy to spend their Saturday afternoons chanting outside his house. The main target of this particular protest was the so-called "bedroom tax"--the reduction of a housing subsidy that primarily benefits poor people. It wasn't a violent protest or anything, at least not while I was there. And it certainly wasn't huge. (See pictures below). Judging by the massive crowds at Harrods and elsewhere in London last week, along with the startling number of Lamborghinis and Ferraris cruising the streets, not everyone in Britain is hurting. But after a frigid March, in which high heating bills continued to clobber poorer Britons, the frustration with Mr. Cameron's austerity extends farther than this particular tax. -------   The action was outside the Downing Street gate--on Whitehall Street. Henry Blodget / Business Insider   Young men with flags and signs confronted police. Henry Blodget / Business Insider   Most of the protesters were out on Whitehall, waving signs blasting the "Bedroom Tax."

David Paleino / FlickrThe S&amp;P 500 hit a new all-time closing high on Friday. The last time that happened was on October 9, 2007.

PBSEarlier we wrote about how David Stockman has a huge unhinged screed in today's NYT about how the US is doomed because of debt, money printing, and crony capitalism. The piece is almost undebunkable because it's so big and unwieldy and, frankly, because it doesn't really try to make a coherent argument. We were curious if Krugman was going to take on the piece, since it appeared in his own paper. Alas he has delivered in a short, brutal post titled Cranky Old Men. Itâ€™s cranky old man stuff, the kind of thing you get from people who read Investors Business Daily, listen to Rush Limbaugh, and maybe, if theyâ€™re unusually teched up, get investment advice from Zero Hedge. Sad. This is really the essence of it. There are a bunch of scared old guys who can only remember the dangers of inflation, and who lap up content about how doomed the world is, and love hearing how dumb powerful people are. That's who all of these folks pander to.
Former Reagan budget director David Stockman has a new book coming out on Tuesday, and he's warming up the public with a massive piece in today's New York Times titled Sundown in America, which basically says the future of America bleak because of massive government debts, crony capitalism, bailouts, megabanks, the removal of the gold standard, and even green energy. The piece can truly be characterized as Hard Money Buzzword Bingo, as Stockman tries to get in as manyÂ  scare lines as possible. Check out this one sentence where he talks about bubbles, Wall Street casinos, the Crucifixion of savers, commodities Main Street, a "Great Deformation", and a rogue central bank: Instead of moderation, whatâ€™s at hand is a Great Deformation, arising from a rogue central bank that has abetted the Wall Street casino, crucified savers on a cross of zero interest rates and fueled a global commodity bubble that erodes Main Street living standards through rising food and energy prices â€” a form of inflation that the Fed fecklessly disregards in calculating inflation. It just goes on and on like this, but his final suggestion is to run for the hills: The United States is broke â€” fiscally, morally, intellectually â€” and the Fed has incited a global currency war (Japan just signed up, the Brazilians and Chinese are angry, and the German-dominated euro zone is crumbling) that will soon overwhelm it. When the latest bubble pops, there will be nothing to stop the collapse. If this sounds like advice to get out of the markets and hide out in cash, it is. It's hard to know where to begin poking holes in the whole thing, but probably the most telling and self-contradicting aspect, is the fact that he traces the original sin of the economy back to FDR taking the US off of the gold standard. The state-wreck originated in 1933, when Franklin D. Roosevelt opted for fiat money (currency not fundamentally backed by gold), economic nationalism and capitalist cartels in agriculture and industry. The problem is that the last 80 years, since then have represented a marvelous time for economic progress in America (and elsewhere). Standards of living have soared, and the tools of modern economic management have meant that we've never had another economic crash anywhere near the level we saw during The Great Depression. Beyond that, the fact that things have gone on for 80 years without the gigantic collapse that Stockman has predicted is a sign that perhaps FDR's move wasn't so horrible. The last few years have been devastating to people with Stockman's biases. The dollar hasn't collapsed. Inflation hasn't soared (food prices are stable). Total debt to GDP (when you include private debt) has shrunk. The financial sector has begun to normalize as a share of the economy. Housing has come back.Â  US borrowing costs are not exploding. Inflation expectations very far out remain tame... probably too tame. In fact the big surprised to many in the economic community is how the US -- which was already seen as an aging lumbering giant in the years going into the crisis (2005, 2006, 2007) is now seen as the country in the best shape in the developed world. There's a widespread view that you have to be long the US in part because of how well we've managed our crisis, but also because factors like energy and demographics augur so well for America's future. There have been numerous warnings from people like Stockman over the last few years, and the market consistently rejects them.
Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS), Italy’s third-largest bank and the world’s oldest, has admitted in a statement posted quietly on its website that its customer deposits have fallen by a “few billion euros.” That was after a series of scandals rocked the more than 600-year-old institution, which included a €730 million derivatives loss it racked up from 2006 to 2009. These transactions are at the heart of a fraud probe at the bank. Italian prosecutors are investigating whether MPS used derivatives transactions to hide losses from regulators. Bloomberg reported in January that Deutsche Bank designed a derivative for MPS in 2008 that obscured the Italian bank’s true financial position just before it applied for a taxpayer bailout. MPS reportedly engaged insimilar trades with Nomura, and Italian police recently searched the Japanese bank’s Milan office. MPS’ troubles appear to have started in 2007, when it overpaid to buy smaller rival Antonveneta without doing any due diligence. The bank’s former finance chief, Gianluca Baldassarri, has been jailed, accused of misleading Italian regulators over the derivatives trades. And in a mysterious twist, MPS head of communications David Rossi was found dead at the bank’s headquarters in early March, reportedly after feeling pressured by the fraud investigation, although he was not himself a subject of the probe. Unsurprisingly, MPS has issued terrible financial results for 2012, posting a €3.2 billion loss. largely due to bad debt provisions and losses on its derivatives trades. The bank released these results at 5.45 p.m. on Maundy Thursday, when many of its Italian depositors and shareholders would have already gone home from work to start their Easter holidays. The MPS scandal has raised questions over the Italian government’s oversight of its financial institutions. Italy agreed to bail out Banca MPS back in June 2012. On Jan. 26 it agreed to extend another €3.9 billion to the poorly funded bank, including rolling over a €1.9 billion loan the bank took out in the middle of the financial crisis. The affair also contributed to the chaos that is still raging over Italy’s recent general elections. MPS had deep links to Italy’s center-left Democratic Party, which had been tipped to win in the February poll, but failed to secure a majority in the Senate necessary to take control. Italy still does not have a government.
Wikimedia CommonsArchbishop Chrysostomos II of CyprusNICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — The leader of Cyprus' Orthodox Christian church vowed to do all he can so that ordinary people "won't go hungry" amid the country's worst financial crisis in decades. Archbishop Chrysostomos II said the church's property belongs to the people, but "dignity" prevents them from asking for help. He said he has instructed parish priests to discreetly seek out those in need. Chrysostomos said after Sunday's liturgy that the church would help create jobs "so that smiles can return to our people's faces again." Cyprus' jobless rate now stands at 15 percent, but economists fear a significant spike in the months ahead following a financial rescue agreement with the country's eurozone partners and the International Monetary Fund that has decimated the troubled banking sector and choked businesses.
REUTERS/China DailyThe unhealthy smog that settled over Beijing earlier this year, capturing international media attention, is not the only visible sign of China's rapid economic growth and the resulting environmental hazards. Countless rivers and lakes have also been contaminated by nearby factories, and sometimes, dumping by local residents.   Jump straight to the pictures »  This March, more than 2,000 dead pigs were found floating in a Shanghai river, a main water source for the city's 23 million residents.  Polluted water sources have been linked to a rise in "cancer villages," or areas where cancer rates are high among people who live along tainted waterways.   Time's Gu Yongqiang contends that China's failure to address environmental problems isn't a product of technical or financial constraints, but rather an overwhelming lack of motivation by authorities.  Mounting public outrage, largely aided by the power of social media, is starting to push officials to take action.  Last week, the state-run China Daily newspaper announced the country's plan to spend $16 billion over the next three years to deal with Beijing's pollution, Reuters reported.  An infusion of cash is only the beginning of a massive and much-needed cleanup effort in a country where it's not uncommon to see rivers turned bright green by algae blooms or thick with garbage and dead fish.

The yuan is allowed to trade in a 1 percent band with the U.S. dollar. Some argue that political factors have driven yuan appreciation now that Xi Jinping is making international visits as China's new president. Here's a one month chart that shows one (onshore) yuan in dollar terms: Google Finance   And here's five-year chart: Google Finance
Households of poorer countries tend to to commit a greater part of their spending to food than wealthier countries, but there are some notable exception.Â  South Korean and Brazilians spend less on food and drink than many wealthier countries.Â  On the other hand, Russia, a medium income country, is more comparable to Indonesia than to other countries in that income cohort. Among this selection of countries, Hungary stands out with relatively low expenditures on food, but significant expenditures on alcohol and tobacco.Â  Read more posts on Marc to Market Â»

THE ESSENTIAL EIGHT Li Huabo, Corrupt Chinese Bureaucrat or Fall Guy? - Businessweek very interesting story..he has to be guilty of something, no? While the wealth and misbehavior of senior Communist Party officials and their families have received international attention, the more insidious forms of official corruption take place at the local level. Tales of corruption have become the stuff of popular roman à clef novels such as The Diary of Government Official Hou Weidong, written by a mid-level sanitation official, which describes a culture of endemic graft. Rarely, however, do outsiders hear directly from bureaucrats caught up in corruption cases. Li told his story to Bloomberg Businessweek during a four-hour interview at his home in Singapore. He maintains he’s innocent of the charges against him—a fall guy, not a crook. His story provides a glimpse of the pervasiveness of influence peddling at all levels of China’s bureaucracy and shows how difficult it is to stop abuses that have become an accepted part of doing business.[<U+89C6><U+9891>]“<U+4E09><U+5305>”<U+670D><U+52A1><U+7F29><U+6C34> “<U+82F9><U+679C>”<U+7F18><U+4F55><U+9738><U+6C14><U+FF1F>_<U+65B0><U+95FB><U+9891><U+9053>_<U+592E><U+89C6><U+7F51> no respite for Apple in China on Good Friday.

It is no good for either side that the issue is gradually turning political...Had Apple been more sincere in its response to the criticism, the result could have been different. The statement Apple made right after the CCTV exposé was very different with that of other multinational companies who were also reported to have consumer rights issues. With the sheer weight of the company behind it, Apple's detached tone could easily be seen as proof of arrogance. Apple has won respect from Chinese consumers with its perseverance in developing leading technologies and styles. But the company is not impeccable...Apple should not follow the media speculation and consider itself the target of political persecution. ..If the issue developed into a head-on confrontation between Apple and the Chinese authorities, the US company will never be a winner, nor will China necessarily do well. Of course, Apple will suffer the most, as its products are already facing increasing competition in China. //the original OpEd, translation not exact <U+793E><U+8BC4>:<U+82F9><U+679C><U+5E94><U+907F><U+514D><U+56F4><U+7ED5><U+5B83><U+7684><U+98CE><U+6CE2><U+6269><U+5927><U+5316>_<U+8BC4><U+8BBA>_<U+73AF><U+7403><U+7F51> interesting global times editorial "advises" apple 2 act 2 prevent china "crisis" from expanding // <U+82F9><U+679C><U+516C><U+53F8><U+9760><U+7740><U+79D1><U+6280><U+548C><U+65F6><U+5C1A><U+521B><U+65B0><U+95EF><U+5929><U+4E0B>,<U+4E5F><U+8D62><U+5F97><U+4E86><U+4E2D><U+56FD><U+5927><U+91CF><U+6D88><U+8D39><U+8005><U+7684><U+5C0A><U+656C><U+3002><U+4F46><U+82F9><U+679C><U+4E0D><U+662F><U+5B8C><U+7F8E><U+65E0><U+7F3A><U+7684><U+3002><U+4E0D><U+65AD><U+6539><U+8FDB><U+6280><U+672F><U+3001><U+4E0D><U+65AD><U+63D0><U+5347><U+670D><U+52A1><U+8D28><U+91CF><U+5BF9><U+5B83><U+6765><U+8BF4><U+4E5F><U+6C38><U+65E0><U+6B62><U+5883><U+3002><U+8FD9><U+5E94><U+662F><U+6211><U+4EEC><U+8BA4><U+8BC6><U+82F9><U+679C><U+516C><U+53F8>,<U+4EE5><U+53CA><U+8BA4><U+8BC6><U+82F9><U+679C><U+540C><U+6D88><U+8D39><U+8005><U+53CA><U+5A92><U+4F53><U+5173><U+7CFB><U+7684><U+57FA><U+7840><U+3002><U+5904><U+5728><U+82F9><U+679C><U+8FD9><U+6837><U+7684><U+9AD8><U+4F4D><U+4E0A>,<U+56DE><U+5E94><U+6279><U+8BC4><U+79EF><U+6781><U+800C><U+5BCC><U+6709><U+5F39><U+6027>,<U+5E94><U+662F><U+4E00><U+79CD><U+57FA><U+672C><U+6001><U+5EA6><U+3002><U+4E2D><U+7F8E><U+5B58><U+5728><U+6587><U+5316><U+5DEE><U+5F02>,<U+5F7C><U+6B64><U+6C9F><U+901A>,<U+4EE5><U+53CA><U+8BC4><U+4F30><U+5BF9><U+65B9><U+6001><U+5EA6><U+5B58><U+5728><U+5929><U+7136><U+7684><U+969C><U+788D>,<U+82F9><U+679C><U+9700><U+8981><U+66F4><U+52A0><U+8C28><U+614E><U+3002><U+82F9><U+679C><U+98CE><U+6CE2><U+4EE5><U+666E><U+901A><U+7EA0><U+7EB7><U+5F00><U+59CB>,<U+4E5F><U+5E94><U+4EE5><U+975E><U+653F><U+6CBB><U+7684><U+65B9><U+5F0F><U+7ED3><U+675F><U+3002><U+897F><U+65B9><U+5A92><U+4F53><U+731C><U+6D4B><U+82F9><U+679C><U+662F><U+4E2D><U+7F8E><U+8D38><U+6613><U+7EA0><U+7EB7><U+7684>“<U+66FF><U+7F6A><U+7F8A>”,<U+82F9><U+679C><U+5E94><U+5F53><U+8EB2><U+907F><U+8FD9><U+6837><U+7684><U+5BF9><U+53F7><U+5165><U+5EA7><U+3002><U+4E2D><U+56FD><U+7684>“<U+679C><U+7C89>”<U+4EEC><U+5982><U+679C><U+771F><U+7684><U+7231><U+62A4><U+82F9><U+679C>,<U+5C31><U+4E0D><U+5E94><U+7092><U+4F5C><U+82F9><U+679C>“<U+53D7><U+8FEB><U+5BB3>”<U+7684><U+60B2><U+60C5>,<U+800C><U+5E94><U+8FD8><U+4E8B><U+60C5><U+4EE5><U+672C><U+6765><U+7684><U+7B80><U+5355><U+3002><U+679C><U+771F><U+7684><U+5C06><U+5BF9><U+6297><U+6FC0><U+5316>,<U+82F9><U+679C><U+663E><U+7136><U+8D62><U+4E0D><U+4E86>,<U+4E2D><U+56FD><U+5F97><U+5230><U+7684><U+4E5F><U+672A><U+5FC5><U+5C31><U+662F><U+6B63><U+5206><U+3002><U+4F46><U+7531><U+4E8E><U+82F9><U+679C><U+4EA7><U+54C1><U+7684><U+53EF><U+66FF><U+4EE3><U+6027><U+8D8A><U+6765><U+8D8A><U+5927>,<U+82F9><U+679C><U+516C><U+53F8><U+7684><U+4E22><U+5206><U+5C06><U+662F><U+6700><U+591A><U+7684><U+3002><U+73B0><U+5728><U+8BB8><U+591A><U+4E8B><U+60C5><U+5728><U+4E2D><U+56FD><U+65F6><U+5E38><U+88AB><U+653F><U+6CBB><U+5316>,<U+4E2D><U+56FD><U+5185><U+90E8><U+7684><U+4EF7><U+503C><U+89C2><U+5206><U+5316><U+5E38><U+628A><U+5C0F><U+4E8B><U+641E><U+6210><U+5927><U+4E8B>,<U+5BFC><U+81F4><U+5BF9><U+7ACB><U+4E1B><U+751F><U+3002><U+8FD9><U+662F><U+4E2D><U+56FD><U+81EA><U+5DF1><U+7684><U+95EE><U+9898><U+3002><U+5916><U+56FD><U+5546><U+4E1A><U+516C><U+53F8><U+5E94><U+79BB><U+4E2D><U+56FD><U+5F53><U+4E0B><U+7279><U+6B8A><U+7684>“<U+653F><U+6CBB><U+70ED><U+60C5>”<U+5C3D><U+53EF><U+80FD><U+8FDC><U+4E00><U+70B9>,<U+522B><U+5F80><U+91CC><U+6405><U+548C><U+3002>How Apple's return policy in China differs from the U.S. - Apple 2.0 -Fortune Tech UPDATE: Several readers have pointed out that European Union consumer laws require Apple to honor claims of defective hardware for 2 years from date of delivery (See the UK for an English language version).

Have any independent experts confirmed that Apple is or is not conforming to current laws/regulations about after-sales support policies for computer/electronic devices?// Official China Daily Fires at Apple over Warranty Complaints -Caijing “Apple offers a global warranty period of 1 year - that's the same whichever country you are in.” wrote China Daily in an article. ”But Chinese law states that warranties on computer sales must be at least two years.” The paper also cited a Chinese lawyer as saying that foreign companies in China should obey Chinese laws and Apple’s warranty clauses apparently violate the nation’s law. Apple changed some of its warranty clauses under amounting pressure but the move was called by Chinese lawyers as putting “old wine in new bottles”. One of the former repair terms “Apple is entitled to retain your product until full payment by you of all charges for the repair,” was replaced with “Apple is entitled to retain your product and provide repair services at relatively-low price.” Chinese consumers demand Apple action over complaints - Xinhua The China Consumer's Association (CCA) has asked Apple Inc. to "sincerely apologize to Chinese consumers" and "thoroughly correct its problems," after the U.S. firm took little action to address waves of criticism. In a statement posted on the CCA's website, Apple Inc. was told to equalize the warranty periods in China compared with other countries. Buyers of iPads, after the company admitted the device is classifiable as a portable computer, are entitled to two-year after-sale service packages for its key components, said the statement.//<U+4EBA><U+6C11><U+65E5><U+62A5>-<U+4E2D><U+56FD><U+6D88><U+8D39><U+8005><U+534F><U+4F1A><U+516C><U+5F00><U+529D><U+8C15><U+82F9><U+679C><U+516C><U+53F8> <U+5C0A><U+91CD><U+6D88><U+8D39><U+8005><U+5408><U+6CD5><U+6743><U+76CA><U+6539><U+6B63><U+5B58><U+5728><U+95EE><U+9898> People's Daily page 4 Saturday on China Consumer Association saying what Apple needs to changeChina resolutely opposes U.S. curbs on IT imports: state media | Reuters State media including Xinhua, the China Daily and the People's Daily, quoted a spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce as saying the U.S. bill "sends a very wrong signal".

Single adults with a permanent Beijing residence registration, who have not made purchases in the city before, are allowed to buy only one apartment, according to the announcement. Shanghai said banks will be banned from giving loans to local residents who are buying a third apartment or more, according to a government announcement. Meanwhile, the two cities will raise down payments for second-home buyers. The two mega-cities both vow to strictly implement the 20-percent tax on capital gains from property sales. Beijing said the tax will be exempt if the property is the seller's only one and they have owned it for five years or more. The Shanghai announcement did not mention similar policy.// Beijing Bans One-Person Households From Buying Second Homes - Bloomberg The city of Beijing banned single- person households from buying more than one residence and increased the minimum down-payment for all buyers of second homes as the government seeks to cool the property market.

The target was laid out Thursday in a document of the State Council's tasks for institutional reform and transforming functions in the next five years, which also laid out deadlines for completing the tasks and the responsible departments. According to the document posted on the official website of the central government, 29 tasks are expected to be completed this year, 28 in 2014, 11 in 2015, and four in 2017.

Russia Beyond The Headlines/Sergei SmirnovRussia is the world's fourth largest gold producer, and Kolyma in the far north-east of Russia is one of the regions most flush with gold.Â  During Stalin's rule, prisoners of the Gulag were sent to Kolyma and forced to mine for gold, which was desperately needed to finance economic development. Now, many of those in the region choose to mine for gold. The miner settlements have however been decreasing since the 1990s.Â   Russia Beyond The Headlines (RBTH) and photographer Sergei Smirnov put together a feature giving us insight into gold mining in Kolyma.

Wikimedia Commons We hope you're having a relaxing weekend. It's going to be another big week for the global economy, kicking off Sunday night. Sunday evening is the beginning of global PMI day, in which we get surveys from Asia, Europe, South America, and the U.S. about the state of each country's manufacturing sector. The PMI day festivities start with China and Korean PMIs, then move to Europe in the early hours of Monday, and end with the release of the U.S. ISM report at 10 a.m. ET. All of the big regions will be key to watch. China is always crucial. Europe seems to be heading into the toilet, and these numbers will provide a crucial gauge on what's going on with that. And then for the U.S., the big question is whether events like the payroll tax holiday and the sequester have mattered at all. There's a lot more stuff throughout the week. On Tuesday we get U.S. auto sales. Then on Wednesday there's Services PMIs along with the ADP jobs report. Thursday is initial jobless claims. And then of course Friday is the big one: The Non-Farm Payrolls Report (AKA the jobs report). Per Calculated Risk, the consensus is for 193K new jobs for the month, although some think we might get a real blowout number. Also on Friday is the trade report, and in the afternoon the Consumer Credit number, which will give another look at household willingness to lever up. So it's going to be a fun one.
Following up from part 1, here are the conclusions and lessons gleaned from last weekâ€™s market action for the coming week and beyond. Conclusions And Lessons: Cyprus, Importance Of Coming Week First, hereâ€™s an update on the confiscations of deposits at Cyprusâ€™s biggest bank, the Bank of Cyprus. Early in the week it appeared that deposits over 100k Euros would take a 30% hit. Later in the week we started hearing 40%. As of Saturday, it was reported that the official decree would give depositors shares worth just 37.5% deposits over 100k Euros, assuming those shares can actually be sold at the issue price. So at best those deposits over 100k Euros face a 62.5% hit. It could get worse if the shares lose value or if there are restrictions on selling the shares. Depositors with sums of over 100k Euros at the second largest Bank, Laiki, have nothing to fear. Theyâ€™ve already lost everything over the EU insured 100k. There have been no changes to the controls on cash and credit card withdrawals announced earlier in the week. Europe Obviously Cyprus was THE big loser. See below for all the gory details. Italy couldnâ€™t form a government, which means months of lingering political uncertainty and probably new elections within the year to replace the temporary caretaker government appointed by the President. The big ramification is that the EU could be pressured by heightened political uncertainty for much of the remainder of the year at a time when it desperately needs the opposite in order to maintain confidence in the face of the continued contraction noted above. Germany also has elections later this year and the existence elections in both the major creditor and debtor nationsâ€™ risks pushing both polities to opposite extremes as candidates in both elections play to voter fears about the other nation. Markets were stressed by fears of increased regulations to cool property prices and sales of opaque but profitable â€œwealth managementâ€ investment products. The US, as much by default as anything else, as its indexes continue higher and its economy continues to slowly improve under continued stimulus. The US isnâ€™t as bound to the decaying EU as Germany, it isnâ€™t a demographic disaster like Japan, and it isnâ€™t in a tightening process like China. No wonder money continues to pour into US stocks as investors accept higher P/Es, and the S&amp;P 500 was finally able to break to new highs despite declining earnings growth. Seven Big Cyprus Ramifications Oof. Where do we even begin? So much has already been written, not without justification. This was big. For the first time since the Greek bond haircuts (which hit Cyprus banks and arguably were a key driver of the Cyprus mess) real pain was inflicted on investors rather than taxpayers. That brings contagion risks, as we discuss below. Here are the key ramifications thus far. 1. Defined The Template For EU Bank Bailouts: Systemic Risk The Key Markets freaked on Monday at the suggestion that the Cyprus bailout was indeed a precedent for confiscating deposits and capital controls in future EU bank bailouts. The implication was heightened risk of massive bank run on GIIPS banks and end of the EU. Of all the articles I read that attempted to define the how the Cyprus deal had increased contagion risk, the Telegraphâ€™s Jeremy Warner hit it best. In essence, he wrote that deposit safety correlated directly withÂ how much of a systemic risk a given bank presented. That risk was defined by both the size of the bank and its sovereign state.Â He likened the situation to that of the US, where depositors at small local banks lose everything when federal authorities close them down, but those at big banks with huge corporate depositors and international presence (aka TBTF banks) get bailed out because they would take down their big corporate and sovereign depositors with them. SeeÂ hereÂ for details. 2. Cyprusâ€™s Future: Depression, EU Exit Despite all the pain, itâ€™s very unclear whether Cyprus will avoid the death spiral and probable EZ exit occurring in Greece. 3. Cyprus Capital Controls MeanÂ De FactoÂ EUR Expulsion  If a Cyprus Euro isnâ€™t as liquid as any other, it isnâ€™t worth as much and thus Cyprus is no longer a full EZ member. No doubt depositors in banks of other at risk nations will take note, and those with over 100k Euros on deposit at any one bank will be far more inclined to take these funds elsewhere while they still can. Thus far, these include: That meansâ€¦. 4. Contagion Risk Up This is the biggest lesson of the prior week, and its effects could be felt for months or years to come. The Cyprus deal dispensed with any doubt that EU bank deposits (as well as those in the US and UK) are less safe than previously believed, especially those in the GIIPS nationsâ€™ banks. A lot was written about that last week. SeeÂ here,Â hereÂ for examples of the genre.Â  Key points include: To be completely fair, there are those who insist that while EU depositors are now on the bail-in menu, theprotection of insured depositors has definitely been confirmed.Â  We disagree. EU leaders (and initially Cypriot politicians too) were ok with hitting insured depositors. It was popular opposition in Cyprus that prevented this move. The last time private investors (i.e. the ones that rule the markets) rather the taxpayers had to take this kind of pain was the Greek bond haircut in the summer of 2011, which led to spiking borrowing costs in Spain and Italy. Risks of new crises in Spain and Italy are trending higher along with their bond yields, and markets are focusing on Slovenia as a likely next hotspot. See our article on the top market drivers for the coming week here for more on that. 5. Continued EU Anxiety Means Continued EUR Downtrend, USD Uptrend In Months Ahead All of the above serve to remind us all of just how big a mess the EU really is, and thatâ€™s brought a new batch of articles predicting the EUâ€™s demise.Â Hereâ€™sÂ the best I saw last week. European stocks have been flat-to-lower in recent weeks, but the EURUSD and other EUR pairs have been sliding hard since the start of February. Barring assorted short term counter moves, this longer term trend, in place since early 2011, should remain in place, and provide some support for the USD and USD investments. 6. Contagion Risk Beyond The EU? The Cyprus deal raises questions about deposit safety even outside of the EU, and that produced some interesting commentary last week. Quick, which investment is more senior in the event of a bank failure, a savings account or derivatives counterparties? SeeÂ hereÂ for the answer. This article has held on for 3 days at the very top of seekingalpha.comâ€™s top article list as of this writing. That only happens when an article really hits a nerve. 7. Harsher Bailouts Until After German Elections  German voters have not been kind to the ruling coalition in recent years, and thatâ€™s believed to be due to anger at seeing their money loaned or given to GIIPS nations of dubious creditworthiness. Much was written last week about how German PM Merkel was the big winner from the Cyprus deal. As Wolfgang Munchau wrote (via businessinsider.comÂ here) There are so many reasons why Cyprus was a win for Merkel: The first week of the month is usually busy, and the above makes it even more important. EU Data Itâ€™s packed with top tier EU PMI reports, bond auctions of benchmark 10 year bonds, and more. See our article on coming week market movers for more. Fed President Evans: Watch US Jobs Reports Next Week â€“ Closely Last week Chicago Federal Reserve Bank Charles Evans noted that he wanted to see 6 consecutive month of over 200k job growth before heâ€™d support any reduction of QE 3. Bernanke probably feels the same way. QE 3 is the primary driver of the US stock rally in the face of data and earnings that donâ€™t support the current historical high or high levels in stocks, US farmland, and other risk assets. US jobs reports (ok, retail sales and GDP also important) are the biggest single driver of the decision for when to pare back QE 3, and probably these same asset prices. The last three months showed 155k, 157k, and most recently 236k for February. Markets are forward looking, so it will be interesting to see how many months in advance risk asset markets will start pricing in QE 3 withdrawal, and whether it makes investors feel optimistic enough to continue the rally or if it causes a selloff. Thus far the consensus estimate for Fridayâ€™s NFP is just around 200k. A second straight 200k month makes it two out of six. See our article on the coming weekâ€™s top market movers for details. Finally, we remind everyone (who else will?) that if most of your wealth is tied to the Euro, US dollar, Yen, or other at risk currency, then you need to diversify your holdings and income stream by currency exposure, just as youâ€™d diversify it by asset class and sector.

Europe had a horrible March. Cyprus was a mess. Italy is a mess. And the economy is going down the toilet. We fleshed out all of these points yesterday, but we wanted to extract one chart from the last one, which is key. This chart is the Citi Eurozone Economic Surprise Index, which attempts to gauge how well economic data is coming in relative to expectations. (Thanks to @guan for making the chart) Thomson Reuters/@guan What the chart shows you is that just a few weeks ago, a lot of data was still beating consensus estimates. Then that turned on a dime in March, as we saw horrible numbers on employment, manufacturing, industrial production, retail sales, and so forth. Specifically, in late February the index stood at +70 and is now at -8. A devastating turn. The Eurozone should be happy that April will bring a refresh.
Bloomberg TVLong-term interest rates are now unsustainably low, implying bubbles in the prices of bonds and other securities. When interest rates rise, as they surely will, the bubbles will burst, the prices of those securities will fall, and anyone holding them will be hurt. To the extent that banks and other highly leveraged financial institutions hold them, the bursting bubbles could cause bankruptcies and financial-market breakdown. The very low interest rate on long-term United States Treasury bonds is a clear example of the current mispricing of financial assets. A ten-year Treasury has a nominal interest rate of less than 2%. Because the inflation rate is also about 2%, this implies a negative real interest rate, which is confirmed by the interest rate of -0.6% on ten-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS), which adjust interest and principal payments for inflation. Historically, the real interest rate on ten-year Treasuries has been above 2%; thus, todayâ€™s rate is about two percentage points below its historical average. But those historical rates prevailed at times when fiscal deficits and federal government debt were much lower than they are today. With budget deficits that are projected to be 5% of GDP by the end of the coming decade, and a debt/GDP ratio that has roughly doubled in the past five years and is continuing to grow, the real interest rate on Treasuries should be significantly higher than it was in the past.The reason for todayâ€™s unsustainably low long-term rates is not a mystery. The Federal Reserveâ€™s policy of â€œlong-term asset purchases,â€ also known as â€œquantitative easing,â€ has intentionally kept long-term rates low. The Fed is buying Treasury bonds and long-term mortgage-backed securities at a rate of $85 billion a month, equivalent to an annual rate of $1,020 billion. Since that exceeds the size of the government deficit, it implies that private markets do not need to buy any of the newly issued government debt. The Fed has indicated that it will eventually end its program of long-term asset purchases and allow rates to rise to more normal levels. Although it has not indicated just when rates will rise or how high they will go, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that the rate on ten-year Treasuries will rise above 5% by 2019 and remain above that level for the next five years. The interest rates projected by the CBO assume that future inflation will be only 2.2%. If inflation turns out to be higher (a very likely outcome of the Fedâ€™s recent policy), the interest rate on long-term bonds could be correspondingly higher. Investors are buying long-term bonds at the current low interest rates because the interest rate on short-term investments is now close to zero. In other words, buyers are getting an additional 2% current yield in exchange for assuming the risk of holding long-term bonds. That is likely to be a money-losing strategy unless an investor is sagacious or lucky enough to sell the bond before interest rates rise. If not, the loss in the price of the bond would more than wipe out the extra interest that he earned, even if rates remain unchanged for five years. Here is how the arithmetic works for an investor who rolls over ten-year bonds for the next five years, thus earning 2% more each year than he would by investing in Treasury bills or bank deposits. Assume that the interest rate on ten-year bonds remains unchanged for the next five years and then rises from 2% to 5%. During those five years, the investor earns an additional 2% each year, for a cumulative gain of 10%. But when the interest rate on a ten-year bond rises to 5%, the bondâ€™s price falls from $100 to $69. The investor loses $31 on the price of the bond, or three times more than he had gained in higher interest payments. The low interest rate on long-term Treasury bonds has also boosted demand for other long-term assets that promise higher yields, including equities, farm land, high-yield corporate bonds, gold, and real estate. When interest rates rise, the prices of those assets will fall as well. The Fed has pursued its strategy of low long-term interest rates in the hope of stimulating economic activity. At this point, the extent of the stimulus seems very small, and the risk of financial bubbles is increasingly worrying. The US is not the only country with very low or negative real long-term interest rates. Germany, Britain, and Japan all have similarly low long rates. And, in each of these countries, it is likely that interest rates will rise during the next few years, imposing losses on holders of long-term bonds and potentially impairing the stability of financial institutions. Even if the major advanced economiesâ€™ current monetary strategies do not lead to rising inflation, we may look back on these years as a time when official policy led to individual losses and overall financial instability.
selfownership1 via YouTubeThen, when the Fed’s fire hoses started spraying an elephant soup of liquidity injections in every direction and its balance sheet grew by $1.3 trillion in just thirteen weeks compared to $850 billion during its first ninety-four years, I became convinced that the Fed was flying by the seat of its pants, making it up as it went along. It was evident that its aim was to stop the hissy fit on Wall Street and that the thread of a Great Depression 2.0 was just a cover story for a panicked spree of money printing that exceeded any other episode in recorded human history. David Stockman, The Great Deformation David Stockman, former director of the OMB under President Reagan, former US Representative, and veteran financier is an insider's insider. Few people understand the ways in which both Washington DC and Wall Street work and intersect better than he does. In his upcoming book, The Great Deformation: The Corruption of Capitalism in America [37], Stockman lays out how we have devolved from a free market economy into a managed one that operates for the benefit of a privileged few. And when trouble arises, these few are bailed out at the expense of the public good. By manipulating the price of money through sustained and historically low interest rates, Greenspan and Bernanke created an era of asset mis-pricing that inevitably would need to correct.  And when market forces attempted to do so in 2008, Paulson et al hoodwinked the world into believing the repercussions would be so calamitous for all that the institutions responsible for the bad actions that instigated the problem needed to be rescued -- in full -- at all costs.  Of course, history shows that our markets and economy would have been better off had the system been allowed to correct. Most of the "too big to fail" institutions would have survived or been broken into smaller, more resilient, entities. For those that would have failed, smaller, more responsible banks would have stepped up to replace them - as happens as part of the natural course of a free market system: Essentially there was a cleansing run on the wholesale funding market in the canyons of Wall Street going on. It would have worked its will, just like JP Morgan allowed it to happen in 1907 when we did not have the Fed getting in the way. Because they stopped it in its tracks after the AIG bailout and then all the alphabet soup of different lines that the Fed threw out, and then the enactment of TARP, the last two investment banks standing were rescued, Goldman and Morgan [Stanley], and they should not have been. As a result of being rescued and having the cleansing liquidation of rotten balance sheets stopped, within a few weeks and certainly months they were back to the same old games, such that Goldman Sachs got $10 billion dollars for the fiscal year that started three months later after that check went out, which was October 2008. For the fiscal 2009 year, Goldman Sachs generated what I call a $29 billion surplus – $13 billion of net income after tax, and on top of that $16 billion of salaries and bonuses, 95% of it which was bonuses. Therefore, the idea that they were on death’s door does not stack up. Even if they had been, it would not make any difference to the health of the financial system. These firms are supposed to come and go, and if people make really bad bets, if they have a trillion dollar balance sheet with six, seven, eight hundred billion dollars worth of hot-money short-term funding, then they ought to take their just reward, because it would create lessons, it would create discipline. So all the new firms that would have been formed out of the remnants of Goldman Sachs where everybody lost their stock values – which for most of these partners is tens of millions, hundreds of millions – when they formed a new firm, I doubt whether they would have gone back to the old game. What happened was the Fed stopped everything in its tracks, kept Goldman Sachs intact, the reckless Goldman Sachs and the reckless Morgan Stanley, everyone quickly recovered their stock value and the game continues. This is one of the evils that comes from this kind of deep intervention in the capital and money markets. Stockman's anger at the unnecessary and unfair capital transfer from taxpayer to TBTF bank is matched only by his concern that, even with those bailouts, the banking system is still unacceptably vulnerable to a repeat of the same crime: The banks quickly worked out their solvency issues because the Fed basically took it out of the hides of Main Street savers and depositors throughout America. When the Fed panicked, it basically destroyed the free-market interest rate – you cannot have capitalism, you cannot have healthy financial markets without an interest rate, which is the price of money, the price of capital that can freely measure and reflect risk and true economic prospects. Well, once you basically unplug the pricing mechanism of a capital market and make it entirely an administered rate by the Fed, you are going to cause all kinds of deformations as I call them, or mal-investments as some of the Austrians used to call them, that basically pollutes and corrupts the system. Look at the deposit rate right now, it is 50 basis points, maybe 40, for six months. As a result of that, probably $400-500 billion a year is being transferred as a fiscal maneuver by the Fed from savers to the banks. They are collecting the spread, they've then booked the profits, they've rebuilt their book net worth, and they paid back the TARP basically out of what was thieved from the savers of America. Now they go down and pound the table and whine and pout like JP Morgan and the rest of them, you have to let us do stock buy backs, you have to let us pay out dividends so we can ramp our stock and collect our stock option winnings. It is outrageous that the authorities, after the so-called “near death experience" of 2008 and this massive fiscal safety net and monetary safety net was put out there, is allowing them to pay dividends and to go into the market and buy back their stock. They should be under house arrest in a sense that every dime they are making from this artificial yield group being delivered by the Fed out of the hides of savers should be put on their balance sheet to build up retained earnings, to build up a cushion. I do not care whether it is fifteen or twenty or twenty-five percent common equity and retained earnings-to-assets or not, that is what we should be doing if we are going to protect the system from another raid by these people the next time we get a meltdown, which can happen at any time. You can see why I talk about corruption, why crony capitalism is so bad. I mean, the Basel capital standards, they are a joke. We are just allowing the banks to go back into the same old game they were playing before. Everybody said the banks in late 2007 were the greatest thing since sliced bread. The market cap of the ten largest banks in America, including from Bear Stearns all the way to Citibank and JP Morgan and Goldman and so forth, was $1.25 trillion. That was up thirty times from where the predecessors of those institutions had been. Only in 1987, when Greenspan took over and began the era of bubble finance – slowly at first then rapidly, eventually, to have the market cap grow thirty times – and then on the eve of the great meltdown see the $1.25 trillion to market cap disappear, vanish, vaporize in panic in September 2008. Only a few months later, $1 trillion of that market cap disappeared in to the abyss and panic, and Bear Stearns is going down, and all the rest. This tells you the system is dramatically unstable. In a healthy financial system and a free capital market, if I can put it that way, you are not going to have stuff going from nowhere to @1.2 trillion and then back to a trillion practically at the drop of a hat. That is instability; that is a case of a medicated market that is essentially very dangerous and is one of the many adverse consequences and deformations that result from the central-bank dominated, corrupt monetary system that has slowly built up ever since Nixon closed the gold window, but really as I say in my book, going back to 1933 in April when Roosevelt took all the private gold. So we are in a big dead-end trap, and they are digging deeper every time you get a new maneuver.

The events surrounding the finance ministers' decision to levy taxes (i.e., partially confiscate deposits) on depositors in a Euro-system bank led to a sequence of blunders that have been well-recited in the press. There is no need to repeat the details here. For readers who missed it, I do want to add this link to the personal observation of Edward Scicluna, finance minister of Malta, who was appointed by his country's prime minister on March 13. His first action was to participate in the notorious Eurogroup meeting on Cyprus. See:Â  http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20130319/opinion/cyprus-a-lesson-for-life.462258.Â  Source: www.timesofmalta.com, March 19. In the Cyprus affair, we observe a defeat of the concept behind the Eurozone and the original European Union. It took half a century to create the European Union after WWII. The driving force was what the French call a "rapprochement" between formerly antagonistic parties. To put it simply, the Germans and French decided to stop killing each other after a thousand years of war. An economic union seemed the right way to go about attaining peace and prosperity.Â  After centuries of destructive inflation outcomes, they realized credible money was absolutely necessary for this peaceful outcome to succeed. That process led to the Maastricht Treaty (1992), the official adoption of the euro (1995), the final exchange-rate setting of the euro (1998), and the actual launch of the euro on January 1, 1999. Eleven countries of the original fifteen in the newly formed European Union agreed to adopt the euro. The currency existed only in virtual form for the first three years and then enjoyed a nearly flawless transition to the physical version, which was immediately accepted. The results were stellar. Interest rates converged down to very low levels. Efficiencies resulted, because currency-exchange costs within the Eurozone were completely eliminated. More transparency in pricing and increased trade among the members of the Eurozone added to their economic growth rates. It was a high time for the euro. In its first years the European Central Bank (ECB) was led by a Dutch central banker, Willem (Wim) Duisenberg, as president, and a French central banker, Christian Noyer, as vice president. The initial governing council of the ECB had a single purpose in mind, and they never violated it. They knew from history that they could not allow the new currency to be destroyed or inflated. They understood that it had to be hard and credible. They set about implementing that policy, regardless of short-term costs. The euro emerged in the early part of the first decade of the millennium as one of the strongest, most widely used, and most dependable currencies in the world. Subsequently, there was a series of expansions of the Eurozone, which now comprises 17 nations. There also followed a softening of credit-quality restrictions and an easing of collateral rules. There has been apparent succumbing to political pressures. The Eurozone is not the same place it was when Duisenberg and Noyer led the ECB. Fourteen years after the euroâ€™s launch, we have the perception of currency weakness, coupled with an ongoing banking-system shock.Â  This January, another Dutch central banker, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, became Chairman of the group of eurozone Finance Ministers.Â  In the space of a few months he has undone all the good work started by his predecessor, Wim Duisenberg.Â  Dijesselbloem has a history.Â  He nationalized a failed bank and insurance group, SNS Reaal, in February.Â  There he wiped out the bondholders and shareholders.Â  We have no arguments with that from our side.Â  But when Dijesselbloem attacked the insured depositors in a Euro-system bank, he went too far.Â  â€œTaxing depositors is no different from outright confiscation of individual wealth.Â  This type of action would not surprise anyone under a communist regime, but it is truly troubling in a supposedly free-market capitalist and lawful society.â€Â  Well said by Chen Zhao, Managing Editor, BCA Research.Â  Readers please note that â€œof the 147 banking crises since 1970 tracked by the IMF, none inflicted losses on all depositors, irrespective of the amounts they held and the banks they were with.â€Â  The Economist (March 23) concluded that â€œdepositors in weak banks in weak countries have every reason to worry about sudden raids on their savings.â€Â  We agree.Â  We advise clients to take no risk with their bank deposits to the extent they can avoid them. So, what will the leadership of the Eurozone do now. Is the euro dying? If that is the case, a requiem may be in order, as we watch it suffer a protracted, agonizing death. We could be seeing the early death throes in Greece and now in Cyprus, and we may soon see them elsewhere (perhaps in Slovenia, Malta, Spain, Italy, or other Eurozone nations). Each in turn may succumb to metastatic euro-failure disease. Or is there a possibility of euro renewal? Could the Cyprus crisis and bank depositor confiscation policy act as a catalyst for change? The Cyprus events come on the heels of the Greek sovereign-debt default. Clearly that was not enough to trigger a change. Will the finance ministers of the Eurozone finally realize that they cannot continue to do what they have done in the past? Will they be cognizant of Einstein's guidance that insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different outcome? Is Europe sufficiently shocked to quickly adopt Eurozone-wide banking standards and impose them? Will they include penalties and losses where necessary? Can they achieve a system-wide deposit insurance structure along the lines of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)? Is it possible to develop a process by which the ECB's authority in regulation and supervision can function and a credible zone-wide banking system be implemented? Will the ECB reinstate collateral standards and adhere to them? Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA) is a proper vehicle only for the resolution of short-term problems. It led to Greeceâ€™s downfall, because it allowed the substitution of unsuitable for suitable collateral.Â  It thereby fed money to deteriorating credits. These and a hundred other issues have become urgent. Therefore, they require actions that will produce results acceptable to markets, investors, bankers, observers, academics, and journalists, all of whom are monitoring these events intensely. And the actions must be believed and accepted by the general populace and the active business person.Â  This sentiment issue has become critical.Â  My sense from recent travel in Europe and the Emirates is that the general European population has given up on its leaders. Europeans feel powerless. My sense also sees a Europe looking for believable answers.Â  If positive action happens quickly, the euro can experience renewal. But it must happen quickly. A bungled effort by the Eurozone finance ministers has resulted in a catastrophe of larger, uninsured deposit failure, threatened breach of smaller deposit insurance, and, now, capital controls. Capital controls are a desperate act and represent failed governance.Â  They are the last twitch of a dying animal.Â  Cyprus now has them. Cyprus will suffer through an economic depression as it joins Greece and others in a downward spiral. Nothing good can come out of the recent events if the finance ministers remain in "business as usual" mode. Political statements in the Eurozone are falling on disbelieving ears. When an official says that everything is safe, he prompts additional runs on his banks. When someone says his government can honor its obligations, no one believes him. At this point, political silence is more credible than affirmative statements.Â  We have traveled the last two weeks in Europe and the Persian Gulf. Our discussions occurred in the midst of the Cyprus and Euro-system crises. We have held those conversations with professionals from as far north as Finland and as far south as Abu Dhabi. We have witnessed and discussed transfers in the billions. We viewed the manner in which they are occurring. We watched the surreptitious bleeding of balances from troubled banks, and we read the reports of individuals, businesses, and other agents performing an end run around the Eurozone finance ministers. Euro sickness is coming to a head. Capital controls are the death of a country, currency, and economy. They create depressions. They are not temporary in the true meaning of a short-term action. Iceland still has capital controls five years after its banking shock. Nearly all countries in Europe are suffering a spiraling down of their financial structures. The 17-member Eurozone's overall growth rate in 2013 will be near zero.Â  The 27-member European Union will not be much better. Europe's leaders face a fundamental question regarding the euro. Do they want a requiem, in which case all they have to do is keep doing what they are doing, or do they want a renewal, in which case behavior must change credibly, immediately and decisivelyÂ  We are going to find out soon enough. Markets will force the requiem if political forces do not deliver the renewal. For investors, this has become an easy decision. You can either bet on the renewal, which we are not ready to do, or you can bet on the requiem, which means capital moves out of the Eurozone. We are underweight in Europe for very good reason. We are emphasizing investment strategies that seek some safety and resilience in a very dangerous, event-driven world. Weâ€™re back in Sarasota.Â  It is supposed to be 75 today, sunny and clear skies.Â  It is Easter weekend and Passover.Â  It is a time for celebration of freedom and resurrection.Â  Both are needed for renewal.Â  Have a good weekend.
