Thomson ReutersA woman holding an umbrella is reflected in an electronic stock quotation board outside a brokerage in TokyoBy Wayne Cole SYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian stocks fell broadly on Wednesday while the U.S. dollar held firm after a slump on Wall Street and tensions over Ukraine instilled a mood of risk aversion across markets. Geopolitical concerns overshadowed upbeat U.S. economic data which included a spike in service-sector activity to a nine-year peak and a surprisingly large increase in factory orders. Yet there was potentially positive news for the global economic outlook as oil prices continued their slide, with Brent crude hitting its lowest in nine months. Higher energy prices essentially act as a tax on consumers and businesses, so the drop should give a fillip to spending power and demand. For now, the drag from Wall Street was too much for regional markets and MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan  slipped 0.5 percent. In China, the CSI300  of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings shed 1 percent. Japan's Topix  gave up 0.9 percent, while the Nikkei  fell 1 percent. Index heavyweight SoftBank  slid 3.8 percent on reports its U.S. subsidiary Sprint had dropped its bid to acquire No. 4 U.S. carrier T-Mobile because of regulatory hurdles. Sprint's shares  slid 11 percent after hours, while T-Mobile Inc  lost 8 percent. In another failed bid, Twenty-First Century Fox , the media company controlled by Rupert Murdoch, said it had withdrawn its offer to buy Time Warner Inc . Shares of Fox jumped, gaining 8.6 percent in after-hours action, while Time Warner shares fell over 11 percent. The Dow  had already dropped 0.84 percent on Tuesday, while the S&amp;P 500  lost 0.97 percent and the Nasdaq  0.71 percent. All 10 S&amp;P 500 sectors ended lower, led by a 2.1 percent drop in energy stocks  as ample supply pressured oil prices. Shares had been weak for most of the Tuesday session, but selling accelerated in the afternoon on reports that Russian troops were massing near the Ukraine border. The unease over Ukraine helped put a mild bid into Treasuries, with yields on 10-year notes  down a tick at 2.48 percent. In currencies, the dollar hit its highest against a basket of currencies  since last September after the Institute for Supply Management said service-sector growth hit an eight-and-a-half-year peak on strength in new orders and employment.  U.S. factory orders were also solid in July and data showed positive revisions to durable goods orders, a sign that the economy continues to improve. The dollar index  was last at 81.544, not far from the overnight peak of 81.626. The euro languished at $1.3367 , having plumbed a nine-month trough of $1.3358. The dollar had less luck on the yen, lapsing back to 102.54  from Tuesday's high of 102.93. The standout currency was the New Zealand dollar, which skidded to two-month lows after milk prices fell again at an auction held by Fonterra Co-operative Group, the world's biggest dairy exporter. In commodities, gold failed to get much of a lift from safe-haven flows and idled at $1,289.95 an ounce . Oil prices remained under pressure as plentiful supplies in Europe and North America outweighed fears that violence in the Middle East and North Africa could disrupt production. Brent crude  edged up 35 cents on Wednesday to $104.96, but that followed its weakest close since November 2013. U.S. crude  was 24 cents firmer at $97.62, following its lowest settlement since early February.  (Editing by Eric Meijer) FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersThe new Infiniti Q50 sports sedan is seen during its launching in Hong KongBy Michael Leibel and Jim Finkle NEW YORK/LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - Chrysler and Nissan said they are reviewing a report by well-known cyber security experts that rates their vehicles among the three "most hackable" cars on the market, along with a General Motors model. Computer security researchers Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek concluded in the report due to be released later this week that the most hackable models out of 20 reviewed were Chrysler Group's 2014 Jeep Cherokee, Nissan Motor Co Ltd's 2014 Infiniti Q50 and General Motors Co 2015 Cadillac Escalade. The researchers are scheduled to discuss their findings on Wednesday at the Black Hat hacking conference in Las Vegas, where thousands are gathering to learn about emerging security threats. Safety of vehicles, medical devices and other equipment with embedded computers is a hot topic this year. "Chrysler Group will endeavor to verify these claims and, if warranted, we will remediate them," said company spokesman Eric Mayne. Nissan said in a statement to Reuters that it was reviewing the findings, adding there is "no indication" that the authors tried to exploit any cyber vulnerabilities in the Q50. General Motors did not respond to requests for comment. Miller, a security engineer with Twitter, and Valasek, director of vehicle security research at the consulting firm IOActive, said they assessed car safety based on the potential for remote attacks. They did not test the vehicles themselves but reviewed key criteria, including the number of remote access technologies such as WiFi and Bluetooth that could allow hackers to gain control of systems to manipulate and cause physical damage to the car, the researchers said. One model from Fiat SpA's Chrysler Group made the list of the three "least hackable" cars: the 2014 Dodge Viper. It shared that distinction with Volkswagen AG's  2014 Audi A8 and Honda Motor Corp's 2014 Accord. Miller and Valasek cautioned that since they had not actually attempted to hack the cars, the ones designated "most hackable" might actually be quite secure. They released their assessments of "hackability" to create what they say they believe is the first general benchmarks that consumers could use to compare the cybersecurity of vehicles. "This doesn't mean that the most susceptible looking isn't in fact quite secure (i.e. coded very securely) or that the most secure looking isn't in fact trivially exploitable," they said in the report. "But it does provide some objective measure of the security of a large number of vehicles that wouldn't be possible to examine in detail without a massive effort," the report said.

AP The Obama administration said Tuesday it was reviewing potential administrative actions to limit stop companies' so-called tax inversion deals, after Sens. Dick Durbin (D-Illinois), Jack Reed (D-R.I.), and Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) sent a letter to President Barack Obama urging him to bypass Congress. Most simply, tax inversions are mergers in which companies based in this case the U.S. acquire a country based overseas and shift their tax base, allowing them to enjoy a lower tax rate on profits made outside the U.S.  "Treasury is reviewing a broad range of authorities for possible administrative actions that could limit the ability of companies to engage in inversions, as well as approaches that could meaningfully reduce the tax benefits after inversions take place, to at least provide a partial fix," a Treasury Department spokesperson told Business Insider. In their letter, the senators said the "growing trend in corporate tax avoidance" has created the need for immediate action.  "Inverted corporations take advantage of all the things American tax dollars provide — from tax credits for research and development, investments in transportation infrastructure, and strong patent and copyright protections, to profiting from taxpayer-supported programs like Medicare and the Veterans Health Administration," they wrote. "Yet, these companies claim to be foreign corporations when it’s time to pay their tax bill—denying the United States billions of dollars in tax revenue and thereby increasing the tax burden on other U.S. taxpayers." Tax inversions, and the proliferation of these tax-dodging mergers, have been one of the summer's biggest political and economic topics of discussion. Democrats have waded discussion of inversions into their agenda ahead of the 2014 midterm elections. The Obama administration has also pushed Congress to tackle the issue this year, even though legislative prospects appear dim. In an interview with CNBC's Steve Liesman on July 25, Obama said companies moving overseas for tax reasons aren't "doing right by the country — and by the American people." And on July 27, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew wrote in an op-ed in The Washington Post that tax inversions have been increasing at "breakneck speed," adding that "there is nothing wrong with cross-border merger activity... but these activities should be based on economic efficiency." Some of the notable mergers announced in recent months include Minnesota-based Medtronic acquiring Covidien in a $42.9 billion deal that allows the company to move its tax base to Ireland, and Illinois-based AbbVie acquiring Shire in a $53 billion deal that will see the company move its tax base to the island of Jersey in the English channel.  We've written about explosion in tax inversions a number of times this year, highlighting this chart from Goldman Sachs, showing the unprecedented amount of pre-tax income potentially moving overseas.

APGood morning! Lots happened overnight. Here’s what you need to know… 1. Russia is massing troops on the Ukraine border. US officials say there’s potential for a large-scale invasion as Russian president Vladimir Putin fortifies his border with the Ukraine. But Putin says there’s a significant humanitarian crisis about to unfold in Ukraine – which could be used as his rationale for sending in troops in what would be, in anyone’s terms, an invasion. 2. US markets fell hard on the news, with the Dow off 0.8%, the S&amp;P down 0.9% and the Nasdaq down 0.7%, despite better-than-expected domestic economic news with the non-manufacturing PMI and factory beating expectations. ASX futures are sharply lower ahead of the start of trade in Australia, with the September contract down 31 points. 3. The US economy could be in for an imminent boost, however, with a new PwC survey showing 36% of private companies are expecting to make major investments in the next 12 months. That’s the highest level in two years. 4. Australia unveiled a new suite of anti-terrorism laws, including a new mandatory data retention regime which will require internet service providers to keep metadata records for users that authorities could then retrieve to investigate someone’s online activities. The government will also restrict Australians from traveling to some countries which are known hotbeds of extremist military training or radicalization. The data retention decision, announced by Prime Minister Tony Abbott with Attorney General George Brandis yesterday, is a significant expansion of the power of Australia’s domestic intelligence agencies – basically it means the government is ordering the monitoring of the online activity of individual citizens in great detail. Civil rights groups are opposed as you would expect but it will also be interesting to hear the views of ISPs in the coming days. 5. Tony Abbott has taken back control of the agenda. It’s a secondary point but something that shouldn’t be missed amid the announcements yesterday: Abbott’s “leader’s call” to drop the proposed changes to the Racial Discrimination Act – which had angered ethnic community groups around the country – puts an end to a messy distraction led by arch-conservatives who sometimes had ugly arguments for the change (such as Brandis saying people had “the right to be bigots”). It also alienated voters in crucial seats in western Sydney who had, in recent years, swung to the Coalition. 6. Rupert Murdoch has walked away from Time Warner deal. Time Warner’s stock is tanking in after hours trade, down 11%, while Murdoch’s Fox is up 7%. Fox announced it to the market this morning, blaming Time Warner’s board and management refusing to even discuss the offer, despite the approach being friendly, and the impact on Fox’s stock price. It’s off the table for now. 7. A 72-hour truce has begun in Gaza. Israeli troops have pulled out of the territory ahead of the ceasefire, aimed at allowing negotiations to end the month-long war. Moments before the ceasefire was due to take effect, Hamas launched a volley of long-range rockets at Jerusalem,Reuters reports. 8. Ever wonder if you’re a narcissist? Now there’s a simple test. 9. Apple will unveil the new iPhone on September 9th in the US, it’s been confirmed. Here’s everything we know about the device so far. Oh, and don’t upgrade your iPhone for a few weeks if you have one now. 10. Stat of the day. The rise of instant messaging applications will increase the number of text messages sent in Britain from 160 billion last year to some 300 billion this year. Most people send about seven texts a day, according to Deloitte, but with IMs, it’s around 46 messages daily or around three for every waking hour. Bonus: most of it is flirting. And people wonder why Zuckerberg bought WhatsApp. Bonus item: Michael Jordan’s still got it. Here’s the 51-year-old legend shooting around draining 11 in a row at a visit to a school.

A new poll from WSJ/NBC finds a high level of dissatisfaction with the president, the U.S. political system, and the economy, and a stunning number of respondents see a grim future for their children. Just 40% of respondents approve of the job President Barack Obama is doing, a level that matches an all-time low. On the matter of foreign policy — which is in the news a lot lately due to Russia, Ukraine, Iraq, and Gaza — the president's approval is at a mere 36%, also at an all-time low. And though the stock market remains close to record highs, while unemployment has dropped considerably, widespread pain is still being felt economically. Sixty-four percent of respondents still say they are feeling the effects of the economic collapse, and nearly half believe the economy is still in recession. But perhaps the worst stat shows the extent to which Americans have lost faith in the future of the country. Seventy-six percent — an all-time high — are skeptical that their children will have a better life. This chart shows how this number has deteriorated rapidly this decade, with an especially sharp jump in the past two years. The gloomiest chart you'll see today: There's no confidence in our kids' future. WSJ/NBC poll: http://t.co/u15eVQchGH pic.twitter.com/mqRMFLjCtF FREE AppDownload

It's Time For Investors To Rebalance Their Portfolios (Morningstar) As the market starts to see more volatility creeping in, Morningstar's Christine Benz recommends that investors take the time to reposition their portfolios and check their asset classes.  "I think it also makes sense to dig a little bit deeper, even intra-asset class, to see whether some rebalancing might be in order. Even though small-cap stocks have sold off so far in 2014, they still have had a tremendous run relative to large-cap stocks, so you may need to do a little bit of trimming there, even though the market has done some of that work for you within equities," Benz said. "Also take a second look at some of the more defensive holdings in your portfolio. They may not look especially great in terms of relative returns over the past five years, but chances are you want them in your portfolio; you want something that will be a little bit more defensive that will hold up well during these periodic bouts of volatility," she said.  "Within fixed income, also take a look at your exposures. We've seen a tremendous runup in some of the more credit-sensitive bond types. High-yield bonds in particular have had a tremendous run. The typical high-yield fund has returned something like 11% over the past five years on an annualized basis. The typical core-type intermediate-term bond fund has returned just 5%." Clients Are Choosing a Lump Sum Payout Over Continuing Pension (Wall Street Journal) An increasing number of clients are concerned about large companies lacking proper pension plans, according to Kevin VanDyke from Bloomfield Hills Financial. He said this is leading to more employees taking a lump sum payment, rather than waiting for the pension plan. "The immediate lump sum payout gives the client more control over their retirement benefits and greater flexibility in how they are used. However, both the adviser and the client need to be disciplined in the management of these assets, or else there's a real risk that the client will end up outliving their income stream," VanDyke wrote in a WSJ column. "What this means from an adviser's standpoint is we have to treat these lump sum assets very carefully. We view the money from the payout as essentially the same as the client's pension, and the client can't afford for us to screw it up. So if we're investing in equities, we also have to have a backup plan to generate income in case the market goes down. For example, certain insurance products offer minimum income benefit riders. The minimum income guarantee may not be not as good as the monthly check from a pension, but it's enough for the client to live on in a worst-case market scenario." The Median Advisory Firm Client Base Grew At The Highest Rate In Six Years In 2013 (FA Mag) According to a report from FA Insight, the median client base for advisory firms grew 6.7% in 2013, the highest rate since the survey started six years ago, reported Jeff Schlegal from FA Mag. "Advisors can partly thank the financial markets for their good fortune, but that’s not the whole story. 'Advisors are doing a good job managing their costs, with expenses as a share of revenue hitting a record low in the six years of our study,' says Dan Inveen, principal and research director at FA Insight," Schlegal wrote. "The study found that while nearly three-quarters of respondent firms reported significant growth rates, only one-third grew without negative side effects. Hence, FA Insight’s report stresses the importance of strategic business development and marketing," Schlegal said. "The report found 85 percent of firms said they have a strategic plan, but many firms also indicated those plans aren’t particularly effective." These Is How Much Your Client Needs To Save To Make It Through Retirement (Financial Planning) One frequent question that comes up when planning retirement is, "How much, and how early, should I start saving?" Financial Planning's Craig L. Israelsen wrote up some guidelines based on salary and expenses, to figure out exactly how much is needed to fund your retirement. "There’s an easy rule of thumb here: For each additional decade of retirement income, your client should save another 5% chunk — but the correlation is tightest when clients start building a portfolio early," he said. "For 30-year-olds, moving to a 10% savings rate from a 5% savings rate provides nine additional years of retirement income. Moving to 15% from 10% adds nine years, and moving to 20% from 15% adds eight years. In general, adding an additional 5% to your savings rate lengthens the longevity of your retirement portfolio’s by nearly a decade." This Could Be A Good Time To Buy Into High-Yield Bonds (Barron's) Junk bonds have been on the decline recently, which could have created more buying opportunities, especially in ETF investing. Mike Aneiro from Barron's spoke in a video interview about the potential upside.  "If you wait out what's happening right now, a lot of people say the fundamentals of the high-yield market are still pretty good. There's no wave of defaults or anything like that that happened in July," he said. "But, as we've been warning at Barron's for awhile, just overvaluation can be a problem, lack of liquidity can be a problem. And when you stir in a little bit of volatility and geopolitical risk, this is when the pullbacks happen." "Now the flipside of that is now "Is this a good buying opportunity?" And in the longer term, it is a pretty decent chance to buy in, because the market has gone through some similar steps over the past few years, and it has always bounced back," he said. "Even during the big bond sell-off in May and June of 2013, high-yield market finished that year up 7.4%. So if you're going to buy, this is a good time to do it. That doesn't mean the risk have abated completely." FREE AppDownload
ReutersT-Mobile CEO John Legere.Sprint has abandoned its plans to buy T-Mobile, The Wall Street Journal and others are reporting. Sprint, through its majority shareholder SoftBank, has been in negotiations to buy T-Mobile for the last few months, reportedly for $40 per share, or about $32 billion. Bloomberg reports that Sprint will announce a new CEO Wednesday who will replace the current CEO, Dan Hesse. Re/code's Ina Fried reports that Sprint has chosen Marcelo Claure to be the new CEO. Claure is on Sprint's board as in charge of Brightstar, a small wireless carrier that Sprint owns a majority stake in. Both stocks got crushed on the news. T-Mobile's stock was down as much as 9% in after-hours trading. Sprint was down as much as 16%. The merger would've created a carrier large enough to compete with Verizon and AT&amp;T, the two largest carriers in the U.S. in terms of subscribers and revenue by a longshot. However, the merger also would've faced intense scrutiny from government regulators. AT&amp;T tried to buy T-Mobile in 2011, but the deal got shot down by the government. CNBC's David Farber reports that regulatory concerns eventually killed the Sprint and T-Mobile merger. T-Mobile is an interesting turnaround story. The carrier was bleeding subscribers at the end of 2012 when CEO John Legere took over. In 2013, Legere began making several moves to scoop up new subscribers. Since then, T-Mobile started carrying the iPhone, eliminated contracts, and started an offer to pay early termination fees for customers switching over from other carriers. T-Mobile is now the fastest-growing carrier in the U.S. All that growth has made T-Mobile a tasty acquisition target. Last week, French company Iliad made an offer to buy T-Mobile, but T-Mobile rejected it. Meanwhile, Sprint has been taking it on the chin. It's losing subscribers and its network isn't as robust as AT&amp;T or Verizon's. FREE AppDownload
Brian RoseThe corner of Washington and East 13th Street in 1985 (left) and 2013.New York in the 1980s was a far cry from the city it is today. At the time, Manhattan was crime-ridden and full of burned-out buildings and unresolved tensions. For photographer Brian Rose, who lived through that era, the present-day city can be startling. “New York was at a precarious point in time. The city could easily have gone the way of Detroit. We didn’t know,” Rose told Business Insider. "Lower Manhattan was a post-apocalyptic landscape of crumbling buildings and abandoned streets. You couldn't tell things were going to get better until the late '80s." Rose recently completed a photographic study of one of Manhattan’s most-changed neighborhoods, the Meatpacking District, which has transformed over the last 20 years from an open-air industrial meat market to a glittering hub of nightlife and restaurants. Rose originally photographed the area in 1985 and returned in 2013 to document the same street corners.   Rose has collected his photos from both 1985 and 2013 in a book, "Metamorphoses," which you can purchase here. He has shared some photos with us, but you can check out the rest in the book or on his website.
Thomson ReutersThe main gate of entertainment giant Walt Disney Co. is pictured in BurbankBy Lisa Richwine (Reuters) - Media company Walt Disney Co's  quarterly profit beat Wall Street expectations, helped by strong results from its movie studio, theme parks and consumer products division. Net income rose to $2.2 billion in the third quarter ended on June 28, up 22 percent from the year-ago period, the company said on Tuesday. Diluted earnings per share reached $1.28, beating analysts' average forecast of $1.17 in a Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S survey. Revenue rose to $12.47 billion from $11.58 billion. Shares of Disney held steady after closing at $86.75 on the New York Stock Exchange. Operating income at Disney's media networks division was flat at $2.3 billion and declined 7 percent for the unit's cable networks segment, due to a decrease at sports juggernaut ESPN. ESPN fell in part from higher programming and production costs and the absence of ESPN UK, which had been sold, Disney said. At the movie studio, operating income more than doubled to $411 million, thanks to the success of "Captain America: The Winter Soldier" and "Maleficent" in theaters and home entertainment sales for "Frozen." The theme parks unit reported operating income of $848 million, up 23 percent from the prior year. Operating income for consumer products rose 25 percent to $273 million due to increases at Disney retail stores and in its licensing business.

Thomson ReutersThe sign of a Walgreens store is pictured in PasadenaBy Kevin Drawbaugh and David Lawder WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retailer Walgreen Co  on Tuesday appeared to back away from a plan to reincorporate abroad to reduce its U.S. taxes, while politicians again urged the White House to curb deals that shift tax domiciles. Walgreen, which operates the largest U.S. chain of pharmacies, will buy the 55 percent it does not already own of European drugstore chain Alliance Boots , but it will not move its tax domicile overseas, Sky News reported. A Walgreen spokeswoman said she had not seen the Sky News report and was unable to comment. Citing sources, the UK-based news outlet said that Chicago area-based Walgreen would proceed, as expected, with its acquisition of the remaining shares of Switzerland's Alliance Boots in a deal valued at about $8.4 billion (5 billion pounds). Walgreen had been under pressure from some of its investors to do an "inversion" deal with Alliance Boots, under which the U.S. company would relocate its tax domicile to Switzerland or Britain to cut its tax bill. Shares in Walgreen ended regular trading on Tuesday at  $69.12, down 4.4 percent. A spokeswoman for Alliance Boots declined to comment. Separately, three prominent Democratic senators on Tuesday urged President Barack Obama to use his executive authority to reduce or eliminate tax breaks for companies that shift their headquarters overseas in tax-driven inversion. Nine inversion deals have been agreed to this year by U.S. companies ranging from banana distributor Chiquita Brands International Inc  to drugmaker AbbVie Inc  and more are being considered. The transactions are occurring a record pace since the first inversion was done three decades ago. Senator Richard Durbin, the second-ranking Senate Democrat, along with Senators Jack Reed and Elizabeth Warren, said immediate action was needed to stem these transactions. "Although we will continue to work toward a legislative solution to the problem, we urge you to use your authority to reduce or eliminate tax breaks associated with inversions," the senators wrote in a letter to the president. Inversions are still rare, but they are becoming more common. Of the roughly 50 inversion deals done since 1983, about 40 percent have been completed just since 2009 and more are being finalized, with many others said to be in the planning stages. An inversion is a deal in which a U.S. corporation buys or sets up a foreign company, then moves its tax domicile into that foreign company and its home country, while leaving core business operations in the United States. Doing such a deal ends U.S. taxation of the company's foreign profits and makes it easier for the company to take other tax-cutting steps. Inversion deals are legal, and company executives who arrange them say they are only trying to minimize the amount of taxes the company pays, as investors expect them to do.

After the financial crisis, the share of 18-34 year olds — millennials — living at home with their parents surged. And there have been several obstacles to homeownership, namely tight credit, lack of affordable homes, high student debt, and weak income growth. But this doesn't mean that millennials have given up the homeownership dream following the crisis, according to Eli Hackel and Hui Shanat Goldman Sachs. "In order to better understand the driver behind this, we look at regional data to separate cyclical impact from structural changes," write Hackel and Shanat. To do this they looked at California, which was hurt by the downturn and North Dakota, where the shale boom helped keep the economy strong.  They found that the "share of 18-34 year olds living with parents shot up in California but stayed little changed in North Dakota." "The regional evidence suggests that cyclical weakness played an important role in the anemic pace of household formation over the past few years," according to Hackel and Shanat. "As the economy recovers, more young individuals should live independently and household formation should normalize." Goldman Sachs/Business Insider FREE AppDownload
Spencer Platt/Getty ImagesDisney crushed expectations with its third quarter earnings, released after markets closed on Tuesday. Chairman and CEO Bob Iger also pointed out what a big hit the company has in a Q4 movie: "Guardians of the Galaxy," which set a record with a $94 million domestic August weekend opening. "We are thrilled with the spectacular performance of 'Guardians of the Galaxy,' which holds great promise as a new franchise for our company and once again reinforces the tremendous value of Marvel,” Iger wrote in the earnings report. Since buying Marvel for $4 billion in 2009, Disney's Marvel movies have earned around $6 billion at the box office and contributed much more through merchandise and related sales. According to Iger, this is just the start. With "Guardians" already set for a 2017 sequel, Iger confirmed, “Our strategy of building strong brands and franchises continues to create great value across our company.” Appearing on CNBC, Iger explained the importance of the film's success: "It's not just about a good movie, it's about that the Marvel brand has arrived." Iger continued: "Guardians of the Galaxy and Marvel is a wonderful story. We believe that when we bought Marvel in 2009 they had great intellectual property, great characters, great stories, and a very talented group of people working for them. "We did not think that a spot light had been put on the Marvel brand and we thought that the continue success in terms of producing movies and with Disney as a partner, and with them being apart of Disney that we could burnish the Marvel brand. We've done a good job of that. I don't mean to sound overly conceited about it, but I think 'Guardians of the Galaxy' speaks volumes in that regard." Next up, Iger says, "We look ahead to 'Avengers 2' and 'Ant Man' and 'Captain America 3' and we just announced a sequel to 'Guardians' which will be in 2017 ... the studio is in great shape."

Vivint SolarAmerica's second-largest residential rooftop solar installer has confidentially filed for an IPO, Reuters' Soyoung Kim and Mike Stone report. Vivint Inc.'s market debut could come as soon as this fall, depending on market conditions, Reuters said. Vivint Inc. is currently owned by PE group Blackstone.  Vivint trails only SolarCity in U.S. panel installation volumes, according to the GTM Research U.S. PV Leaderboard, though at 9% of market share remains well behind SolarCity's 29%. Vivint Inc. also owns a home security business. The solar and security units combined employ 2,200 people. Blackstone paid $2 billion for Vivint in 2012.  Shares in SolarCity were little changed on the report, which was published before noon Tuesday.  Based in Provo, Utah, Vivint Solar was launched in 2011. In a recent interview with BI's Jay Yarow, Vivint Solar CEO Todd Pedersen argued his firm had taken just two years to attain a size that it took where SolarCity 8 years to reach. "They'll probably be big, we'll just be bigger, is the bottom line," he said.   Click here to read the full report from Reuters » FREE AppDownload
Jonathan Erns/ReutersFox just withdrew its offer for Time Warner. Time Warner's stock tanked 10% on the news. Fox's stock, meanwhile, jumped about 7%. Time Warner's stock is still trading well above the level it was trading immediately prior to the moment news of Fox's offer leaked ($71). This suggests that some traders think Mr. Murdoch will be back. Not so, says one insider familiar with the situation. "That's it. Game over," the insider says. The insider says two things caused Murdoch to pull his bid: 1) the "entrenchment" of Time Warner's board and management, who refused to even discuss the offer, and  2) the significant drop in Fox's stock after news of the offer leaked. The overture for Time Warner was about creating value for Fox shareholders, the insider said, not destroying it. And given the reaction of the Fox stock price to the news, Fox has decided that it can create more value for shareholders by buying back its own stock and executing its own plan than by chasing after Time Warner. So does that mean that a Fox-Time Warner deal is off the table forever? No. Now that Mr. Murdoch has dangled a huge windfall in front of Time Warner shareholders, only to take it away, one imagines that some of those shareholders may soon be venting their frustration to Time Warner's board and management. Mr. Murdoch, meanwhile, has demonstrated to his own shareholders that he's not going to go pay anything just to get his hands on Time Warner — an example that will likely be remembered if and when Mr. Murdoch makes another offer. So what happens if Fox were able to boost its own stock price and generate more cash over the coming months and quarters? Never say never.

Thomson ReutersA man walks past a sign board of Japanese auto parts maker Takata Corp's Annual General Meeting in TokyoDETROIT (Reuters) - Subaru of America said it is recalling about 5,000 older model cars with passenger-side air bag inflators made by Takata Corp. that may rupture and break into metal fragments that could harm passengers, the automaker and U.S. safety regulators said on Tuesday. Subaru, a unit of Fuji Heavy Industries, said it will recall model year 2003-2005 Legacy, Outback and Baja models as well as 2004-2005 Impreza that are or ever were registered in Florida, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. A Subaru of America spokesman said the company has not found defective air bag inflators in any of its vehicles in the area involved in the recall and is not aware of any injuries related to this issue. Subaru is conducting the recall "out of an abundance of caution" the spokesman said. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in June began asking automakers with Takata air bag inflators in their vehicles to recall cars for inspection in the limited region because high humidity may cause defective inflators to malfunction. A letter from NHTSA to Subaru dated Monday shows that cars that are brought in for inspection will have air bag inflators replaced. Also, it said, engineers will gather the older inflators for analysis. (Reporting by Bernie Woodall; Editing by Grant McCool) FREE AppDownload

First SolarShares in First Solar were off 5.5% after hours Tuesday. The Tempe-based solar panel manufacturer and distributor reported revenues of $544 million versus $785.88 million forecast. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.04. Bloomberg said that figure may not be comparable with analysts' estimates. The firm now claims to have created the highest efficiency thin film photovoltaic cell on record, at 21%.  First Solar chalked up the revenue miss to delayed recognition of a project from last quarter, as well as project delays this quarter. Some revenue will now be deferred to the second half of the year, it said. The company reaffirmed its full-year 2014 EPS and operating cash flow guidance.  Full release » FREE AppDownload
DisneyDisney reported third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.28 on revenue of $12.47 billion. Analysts were looking for earnings per share of $1.16 on revenue of $12.16 billion, according to data from Bloomberg. In after hours trade following the report, shares of Disney were up 0.5%.  Revenue at Disney's media networks segment grew 3% to $5.5 billion, while parks and resorts revenue was up 8% to $3.9 billion and studio entertainment revenues grew 14% to $1.8 billion.  Free cash flow decreased 25% from the prior year quarter, falling to $2.05 billion from $2.72 billion.  Disney reported that operating income in its cable networks segment fell 7% to $1.9 billion due to an decrease at ESPN. The company said this was due to "higher programming and production costs, decreased recognition of previously deferred revenue and the absence of ESPN UK, which was sold in the fourth quarter of the prior year." At ESPN, the company said, "advertising revenue increased due to higher rates and more units sold. Higher rates reflected the benefit of FIFA World Cup soccer in the current quarter, partially offset by two less NBA finals games this year." "Frozen" again bolstered Disney's results, with the company saying that income in its worldwide home entertainment segment was drive by unit sales growth, reflecting the success of "Frozen." In its second quarter, the media giant reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.11 on revenue of $11.65 billion and reported studio entertainment revenue that was up 35% over the prior year, reflecting the success of its "Frozen" and "Thor: The Dark World" titles.

Morgan Stanley spokesman Mark Lake and the attorney general's office declined to comment to Reuters on the report. A spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs was not immediately available for comment. Dark pools are broker-run trading venues that let investors trade shares anonymously and only make trading data available afterwards, reducing the chance of information leaking about trade orders. But the lack of transparency around dark pools has drawn the scrutiny of regulators, concerned that brokers and proprietary trading firms that use aggressive high-frequency trading strategies have an unfair advantage over other clients. Barclays is facing allegations by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman that it lied to clients about its dark pool. The bank has urged the dismissal of the lawsuit in New York. Germany's Deutsche Bank and Switzerland's UBS and Credit Suisse have said they are being probed by U.S. regulators as well.  (Reporting by John McCrank; Editing by Lisa Shumaker) FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Jason ReedRupert Murdoch, executive chairman of News Corp., during a panel discussion at the B20 meeting of company CEOs in Sydney on July 17.Fox has withdrawn its plans to purchase Time Warner, according to an announcement the company made Tuesday. Time Warner shares are down 11% post-market on the news. Reports of an original proposal had surfaced in June, and the expectation was that Fox would put in a higher offer. That caused shares of Time Warner to surge above the $85/share that was reportedly offered. A source told Reuters that Fox's offer for Time Warner would not rise above the $90 to $95 range, and sources told Business Insider that shareholders were concerned that Rupert Murdoch, Fox's CEO, might overpay for Time Warner. The merger would have created one of the world's largest media conglomerates, including properties like TNT, HBO, and Fox News. CNN, Time Warner's news network, would most likely have been spun off and sold. Fox also announced that it has authorized a $6 billion share buyback, likely an attempt to assuage potentially disappointed shareholders. The stock is up almost 7% in post-market trading. From the press release: Chairman and CEO Rupert Murdoch commented: “We viewed a combination with Time Warner as a unique opportunity to bring together two great companies, each with celebrated content and brands. Our proposal had significant strategic merit and compelling financial rationale and our approach had always been friendly. However, Time Warner management and its Board refused to engage with us to explore an offer which was highly compelling. Additionally, the reaction in our share price since our proposal was made undervalues our stock and makes the transaction unattractive to Fox shareholders. These factors, coupled with our commitment to be both disciplined in our approach to the combination and focused on delivering value for the Fox shareholders, has led us to withdraw our offer. “21st Century Fox’s future has never been brighter. The strength of our leading franchises, combined with the power of our emerging growth businesses and the leadership positions of our international enterprises put us on a path for even greater success.” The Board today authorized a $6 billion share repurchase program. The repurchase of an additional $6 billion of Class A Common Stock is expected to be completed in the next 12 months. Mr. Murdoch continued, “This significant return of capital underscores the Company’s ongoing commitment to disciplined capital allocation and returning value to shareholders in a meaningful way.” FREE AppDownload

REUTERS/Valentyn Ogirenko Members of Ukrainian self-defense battalion "Donbass" prepare to relocate to another base in the eastern Ukrainian town of Popasna August 4, 2014.Stocks finished lower on Tuesday despite better than expected economic data this morning, as an afternoon reports indicated that Russia has stepped up its military presence along the Ukrainian border. First, the scoreboard: And now, the top stories on Tuesday: 1. The July non-manufacturing PMI report from the Institute for Supply Management came in at 58.7, topping expectations for a 56.5 reading. This was also up from a 56.0 print in June. ISM said it was the highest reading for the non-manufacturing headline index since its inception in January 2008, and the report's new orders sub-index registered a 64.9, the best reading since August 2005. Following the report, Dean Maki at Barclays said, "The surge in the ISM activity indexes, particularly that in the employment index, is somewhat surprising given the slowdown in private service sector job growth in the July employment report; the ISM report suggests that this slowdown in job growth should not be seen as a sign of developing weakness in the service sector and bodes well for growth in this sector in H2 14." 2. The Census Bureau's latest factory orders report showed orders jumped 1.1% in June, topping estimates for a 0.6% increase. June's number, however, was revised down to show a 0.6% decline, compared to an initial reading for a 0.5% decrease.  3. Markit's services PMI for July came in at 60.8, which was in-line with expectations and down slightly from 61 in June. "While the economy looks set to continue to expand at robust pace in the second half of the year, these summer months may turn out to represent the peaking in the rate of growth, Markit Economics' Chris Williamson said. 4. In stock news, Target announced that second quarter earnings would miss expectations. Target said soft sales are continuing in its Canadian stores, while the retailer also took a $148 million charge related to its data breach during last year's holiday season. "Since the data breach last December, we have been focused on providing clarity on the Company’s estimated financial exposure to breach-related claims," said John Mulligan, interim president and CEO, CFO of Target. "With the benefit of additional information, we believe that today is an appropriate time to provide greater clarity on this topic." Following the announcement, shares of Target fell 4.4%. 5. Apple is going to announce its next iPhone on at an event on September 9. Apple shares finished the day slightly lower. Here's everything we know about the upcoming iPhone. 6. Stocks took a deep dive just before 2:00 pm ET, with the Dow falling nearly 200 points at one point, and traders attributed the move to a Financial Times report that said Russia was increasing its troop presence near the Ukrainian border.  7. A note from Goldman Sachs' U.S. equities team said that in the next several years there will be a "dramatic divergence" in the performance of stocks and bonds. Goldman, which says it expects interest rates to move to 4% by 2018, said that over the next several years stocks are poised to return 4% on an annualized basis, while bonds will provide investors with a -1% real return, adjusted for 2% inflation.  Don't Miss: These 10 Up-And-Coming Neighborhoods Are The Next Big Things In Housing » FREE AppDownload
AP Photo/Don RyanFollowing the financial crisis, U.S. companies cut back on expenditures. Yet even as the economy recovered however they continued to sit on piles of cash. For some time it's been argued that once companies began unleashing capital spending, the U.S. economy would finally shift out of its modest-to-moderate gear. That moment may be imminent. A new report from PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PWC) shows that 36% of private companies expect to make major new investments over the next twelve months — the highest reading in two years. This makes sense considering 59% of private company CEOs are optimistic about the U.S. economic outlook over the next 12 months.  Executives plan to put 8.4% of their sales into capital projects now, compared with 6.4% a year ago. And those saying they would plan to put their money into geographic expansion improved 3% from last year.  PwC The PwC tracked 205 U.S. businesses. FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersFile photo of T-Mobile CEO John Legere speaking during a news conference at the 2014 International Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las VegasBy Sophie Sassard LONDON (Reuters) - French telecom firm Iliad  is in talks with investors to improve its bid for T-Mobile US because it expects parent company Deutsche Telekom  will reject its $15 billion offer, three sources familiar with the matter said. Bringing in more investors would help Iliad raise the cash portion of its $33 per share stock and cash bid for a 56.6 percent stake in T-Mobile , the No. 4 U.S. mobile operator, said the sources who asked not to be named because the talks are private. Deutsche Telekom , which is currently in advanced talks with Sprint, the U.S. No 3 mobile operator controlled by Japanese firm Softbank Corp , is expected to reject Iliad's bid as too low, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday. Iliad is in talks with U.S. satellite and cable operators including Dish Networks , Cox Communications [COXC.UL] and Charter Communications  which could be interested in a joint-bid for T-Mobile as they seek to enter the U.S. mobile market, said the sources. Iliad is also talking to infrastructure and pension funds such as Ontario Teachers Pension Plan (OTPP) and sovereign wealth funds including Singapore's GIC, said the sources. Earlier this year, GIC and OTPP demonstrated their interest in mobile investments when they agreed to back France's third mobile operator Bouygues Telecom in its failed bid for domestic rival SFR, which was acquired by French cable operator Numericable . OTPP declined to comment. Iliad, Dish, Cox Communications, Charter Communications, GIC were not immediately available for comment. The Paris-based company, majority owned by billionaire founder Xavier Niel, said a merger would result in $10 billion in synergies and an additional $2 billion in annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). It would hit those targets by running T-Mobile, majority owned by Deutsche Telekom AG , in a more streamlined, efficient way as it has done with its challenger Free Mobile service in France, sources earlier told Reuters. But Deutsche Telekom has doubts about the cost savings goal that Iliad has touted, sources said on Monday, and analysts in the U.S. have also been skeptical.

Getty Images/Justin SullivanNEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. oil industry group is recommending that all crude shipped by rail from North Dakota's Bakken fields be labeled as the most-dangerous type of oil cargo, a designation that could hasten the use of new or upgraded tank cars. On Monday, the North Dakota Petroleum Council (NDPC) released the final results of a wide-scale study on the quality characteristics of Bakken crude, which has been involved in several fiery oil-train derailments over the past year. The study confirmed preliminary findings released in May suggesting that Bakken was little different from other forms of light, sweet U.S. crude and posed no greater threat versus other fuels when transported by rail. The NDPC also issued a series of recommendations following the study, however, including one urging oil-by-rail shippers to classify all Bakken crude oil as "Packing Group I" hazardous materials. That is the highest-risk level of a three-tiered danger assessment, and the NDPC said it was recommended "even though the majority of samples tested for the study would fall within specifications for PG (Packing Group) II." Current methods for testing boiling point, the key criteria for differentiating PG I and II classifications, can be inconsistent, the NDPC said. Because it typically contains a high proportion of very light hydrocarbons and petroleum gases, Bakken crude tends to boil at lower temperatures. "The margin of error for the test methodology can result in different labs testing the same sample with values meeting both PGs. PG I has the more stringent standards and is therefore recommended to avoid further confusion," said the NDPC report, which was prepared by industry consultants Turner, Mason &amp; Co. Historically the Packing Group label has made no material difference in how oil is handled on trains; its only purpose was to inform emergency responders about the cargo. The DOT-111 tank car, the model used almost exclusively to ship oil by rail, is able to transport any Packing Group. Many oil companies have been using PG I routinely simply to ensure they were compliant. But under new regulations proposed last month by the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Packing Group determination could become a pivotal factor in determining how quickly shippers use new or upgraded tank cars that will gradually replace older-model DOT-111s long seen as flawed. The NDPC represents major producers in the Bakken including Marathon Oil Corp, ConocoPhillips, Continental Resources and Hess. Authorities had already begun to crack down on misclassified oil shipments after the Lac Megantic tragedy in Canada last year, when a runaway oil-train with cargo from the Bakken energy patch derailed and killed 47 people in the center of a Quebec town. In February, the DOT's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) fined three companies for using incorrect Packing Group labels for their Bakken cargoes. Two of them had mislabeled shipments as PG II, when in fact they should have been labeled PG I. A third company had used a PG III label rather than PG II. The DOT rules last month said older model DOT-111 cars would not be allowed to carry Packing Group I crudes within two years, while less dangerous crudes that fall into PGs II and III could still be shipped in the older cars for three and five years. The rules are open to public comment and may not be finalized for several months. In its own study released last month, the PHMSA said most crude from the Bakken tested as PG I or II material - "with a predominance to PG I". It also said the oil was "more volatile than most other types of crude," a finding disputed by both the American Petroleum Institute and NDPC.

Bloomberg TV Analyst Sean Egan downgraded Jefferies in 2011.On Monday we wrote about Jefferies CEO Rich Handler's brilliant email sharing 10 life lessons he wants all of his employees to learn this summer.  The lessons are in the form of an imagined summer reading list, and the book titles are made up. Each title/synopsis is supposed to represent a lesson.  If you know the history of Jefferies, you'll notice that one of the books is a bit of a head-scratcher. Here it is:  6. 10-Q Reading for Dummies: A simpleton’s guide to looking at long positions and short positions of the same asset class when they are both listed on the same page  What's he saying? It turns out, Handler is taking a big (but veiled) shot at the credit ratings agency Egan-Jones. Here's the deal ... In fall 2011, broker-dealer MF Global had just filed for bankruptcy. At this time, folks were wondering which firm could be next.  Ratings agency analyst Sean Egan, the cofounder of Egan-Jones Ratings Company, cried MF Global for Jefferies. He downgraded the company's stock and made appearances on CNBC, Fox Business, and Bloomberg TV slamming the firm. As a result, Jefferies stock tanked. Jefferies didn't go the way of MF Global. The company survived, and a year later, the firm was acquired by Leucadia.  The joke inside at Jefferies is that Egan refused to look at all of their long and short positions that were listed on the same page of their 10-Q showing that they were in fact fully hedged. Late last year, Egan emailed Handler, "I would like to apologize for harm caused to you," Dealbook's Susanne Craig reported. The two met at Jefferies offices in Midtown. According to the report, Egan said he would go on-air and apologize. That never happened. Egan told Dealbook that he still stood by his report.  Some feuds never end.  FREE AppDownload

REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton A trader outside the New York Stock Exchange on Oct. 6, 2008. Stocks are sliding. The Dow was down as much as 200 points Tuesday. The S&amp;P 500 was off 19 points, and the Nasdaq fell 33 points.  Headlines about Russian troop movement near the border of Ukraine is one possible explanation for what's spooking stocks. "Moscow has around 20,000 troops deployed in battle-ready formations on the border, according to senior Nato military officers — significantly more than the 15,000 U.S. officials said were deployed there last week," the FT's Sam Jones and Roman Olearchyk report. "While the number is still well below the 40,000 Russian troops deployed near Ukraine in April, the sharp rise in just a few days has been a cause for significant concern among Western military powers." There has also been a ramp-up in talk that the Fed could accelerate the end of its dovish environment monetary, either through accelerating the tapering of its bond-buying program or raising interest rates sooner than expected.  Among the biggest losers were Intel, Target, and Groupon, which reports earnings after the bell Tuesday.  FREE AppDownload
Brian Snyder / ReutersThe primary reason for the incredible slowdown in healthcare spending growth has been due to a sluggish economy, according to a new study from researchers at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. The study, published in Health Affairs this week, suggests that as the economy continues to pick up steam, healthcare costs will also likely grow at higher rates than they have been for the past few years. The primary driver of future debt and deficits in recent projections has been the growth of federal healthcare spending, something that has alarmed economists as a wave of baby boomers retires and more people are added to the Medicare and Medicaid rolls.  But over the last four years, healthcare spending has grown at a historically slow rate. Economists have credited the Affordable Care Act in part, as well as other reforms. But according to the new study, the recession and struggling economy together accounted for around 70% of the slowdown in healthcare spending. "By exploiting regional variations in the severity of the slowdown, we determined that the economic slowdown explained approximately 70% of the slowdown in health spending growth for the people in our sample," wrote the study's authors — David Dranove, Craig Garthwaite, and Christopher Ody.  "This suggests that the recent decline is not primarily the result of structural changes in the health sector or of components of the Affordable Care Act, and that — absent other changes in the health care system — an economic recovery will result in increased health spending." Add the Northwestern study to a growing list of divergent analyses on the topic. Last year, researchers at Harvard University concluded the economy was not primarily responsible for the healthcare spending slowdown, providing evidence the trend could continue. The Kaiser Family Foundation found, however, that the economic downturn was responsible for about 77% of the health spending slowdown. The Northwestern study relied on different methodology and techniques to arrive at its conclusion. It analyzed data from the Health Care Cost Institute of 47 million Americans who had employer-sponsored health insurance.  The researchers compared healthcare spending trends from 2007-09 and 2009-11 in metropolitan areas that were hit particularly hard by the recession (like Las Vegas) and those that weren't (like Dallas). It found that in places like Las Vegas, in which there was a 5.6% employment-to-population decline from 2009-11, health spending only grew 5.4% from 2007-11. In Dallas, which saw a 3% employment-to-population decline, healthcare spending exploded by 28%. Here's a chart showing that effect: Health Affairs/Northwestern University In their conclusion, the researchers warn their study does not mean spending will automatically increase, as reforms contained in the Affordable Care Act and elsewhere in the healthcare system could offset future growth.  There are also a couple of caveats — even if only 30% of the slowdown is due to reforms, that's still a significant development.  Peter Orszag, the former director of the Office of Management and Budget, also pointed out a potential flaw — it only addresses people who have employer-sponsored insurance, and not Medicare. Medicare has seen extremely slow cost growth since the Affordable Care Act was passed — enough to extend the projected life of its major trust fund by at least 13 years. "What this study doesn't address is Medicare, where the deceleration can't be explained by the economy," Orszag said in an email. "That's why I keep harping on Medicare as a better indicator of potential structural change than either total or commercial spending — Medicare is not strongly influenced by the economy and its enrollment is growing gradually, not in a step-function as the exchanges and Medicaid eligibility ramp up."   CLARIFICATION: This post was updated to clarify that the researchers are from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University.

Thomson ReutersA woman walks past a Citibank logo displayed outside the Citibank Plaza in Hong KongBy Joseph Ax NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Tuesday reluctantly approved a $285 million fraud settlement between Citigroup Inc  and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, two months after an appeals court voided his decision to reject it as inadequate. U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff said he had little choice but to approve the deal, which did not require the bank to admit to any wrongdoing. But he said he feared the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals' decision would rob such settlements of any "meaningful oversight." "That court has now fixed the menu, leaving this court with nothing but sour grapes," he wrote in a brief opinion outlining his disappointment. The 2nd Circuit in June ruled that Rakoff had abused his discretion in rebuffing the settlement in November 2011, finding he had failed to give enough deference to the regulator. Rakoff had objected to the SEC's decades-old practice of letting some corporate defendants settle allegations without admitting or denying the charges, a decision that is credited with altering the public debate over such deals. Last June, SEC Chair Mary Jo White, a former federal prosecutor, adopted a policy of requiring admissions in certain major cases, citing the need for more public accountability. The SEC complaint against Citigroup concerned a 2007 sale of mortgage-linked securities debt that caused more than $700 million of investor losses. In his opinion, Rakoff characterized the standard set forth by the 2nd Circuit for approving settlements to be "very modest" and warned that it left judges with little role. "Nonetheless, this court fears that, as a result of the Court of Appeal's decision, the settlements reached by governmental regulatory bodies and enforced by the judiciary's contempt powers will in practice be subject to no meaningful oversight whatsoever," he said. "But it would be a dereliction of duty for this court to seek to evade the dictates of the Court of Appeals." Spokespeople for the SEC and for Citigroup could not immediately be reached for comment. The case is U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission v. Citigroup Global Markets Inc., U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 11-cv-7387.

Wikimedia CommonsDavid Kostin and the U.S. equities team at Goldman Sachs are out with a big call on stocks and bonds in the coming years: "dramatic divergence." Factoring in the impact of the Fed raising interest rates — which Goldman's economics team expects to happen in the third quarter of 2015 — Kostin and his team expect the real return for stocks to be 4% annualized while bonds will return -1% annualized over the "next several years." Kostin writes: We forecast a dramatic divergence between potential stock and bond returns during the next several years. We assume a neutral fed funds rate will be reached in 2018 and 10-year Treasuries will yield 4.5%. Our baseline scenario implies an annualized total return of 1% on a constant maturity 10-year Treasury note through year-end 2018 (roughly corresponding to a return on an intermediate-term bond fund). Buying a 10-year Treasury note and holding it through 2018 would also generate a nominal annualized return of 1%. In contrast, our scenario anticipates the S&amp;P 500 will generate an annualized total return of 6%. Taking inflation into account, the annualized real total return forecast equals -1% for a constant maturity bond strategy (-2% for a buy-and-hold) compared with +4% for S&amp;P 500. Now, a major factor in Kostin's call is a Fed funds rate of 4% in 2018, a view roughly in line with the Fed's long-run projection for a 3.75% rate.  The current Fed funds rate is 0% to 0.25%.  Kostin notes that some argue current yields reflect a change in the future prospects of the U.S. economy, or what Larry Summers famously called "secular stagnation." This view holds that long-term interest rates are likely to hold near 2% rather than the 4% Goldman is forecasting. This chart shows Goldman's interest rate projections against this outlook.

Thomson ReutersA view of the sign outside the Dollar Tree store in Westminster(Reuters) - Discount retailer Dollar General Corp  is considering a rival bid to Dollar Tree Inc 's $8.5 billion offer for Family Dollar Stores Inc , Bloomberg reported, citing people with knowledge of the matter. Dollar General shares were up 3 percent at $57.62 on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday. Family Dollar shares were also up 2 percent at $77.26. Dollar Tree shares were down 1.8 percent at $54.99 on the Nasdaq. Dollar General was working with an adviser to evaluate options, knowing banks are willing to finance a counter-bid, Bloomberg said, quoting one of the sources. (http://bloom.bg/1ARE24z) There was no guarantee that the company would make an offer, the report said. One of the sources put the chance of a rival Dollar General bid at 50 percent. The company will lose its position as North America's largest discount retailer if Dollar Tree buys Family Dollar. Carl Icahn, Family Dollar's largest shareholder when Dollar Tree offered to buy it, had pushed the company to sell itself to Dollar General earlier. Dollar General couldn't be immediately reached for its reaction to the report. Family Dollar declined to comment.  (Reporting by Ramkumar Iyer in Bangalore) FREE AppDownload
Everyone knows there are high markups in restaurants, bars, and most retail goods, but what about celebrity real estate? The folks at real estate website Movoto looked at a number of celebrity homes in the Los Angeles and Malibu areas to see if the prices of these homes were inflated compared to similar non-celebrity homes in the same area simply because a famous person used to live there. The answer, they found, is "yes" ... depending on the celebrity. Robert Pattinson's place in Los Feliz, for example, sold for 202% above the average home price in the neighborhood, but Katy Perry's Hollywood Hills home went for 27% below average. Here's an infographic Movoto created looking at 12 different homes and whether they fell victim to "celebrity inflation": Movoto FREE AppDownload
This morning, the Wall Street Journal reported on funds that choose to tie their fates to the performance of companies led by women. Barclays’ Women in Leadership Total Return Index, which consists of American companies with a female CEO or whose proportion of female board members is at least 25 percent, is one of number of new funds that aims to capitalize on the finding that companies with female leaders tend to outperform those where women are relatively absent. (Amusingly and depressingly, even if Barclays were based in the U.S., it wouldn’t qualify for its own fund, due to its lack of female leaders.) The female-favoring trend the Journal identified stems from research suggesting that companies run by women simply do better. For example, a 2011 report from Catalyst, a nonprofit promoting women in business, found that over the course of five years, companies with women on their boards had average returns on equity of 15.3 percent, while those of companies without any female board members were 10.5 percent. (Return on equity is a figure that gives a sense of a company’s ability to generate profit from shareholders’ investments.) But the benefits of investing in female-led financial endeavors go even further than the Journal has it: Hedge funds run by women tend to outperform other hedge funds. A report put out in early 2013 by the accounting firm Rothstein Kass indicated that between January 2012 and September 2012, an index of 67 hedge funds owned or managed by women had a return of 8.95 percent—significantly more than the 2.69 percent return generated by an index “designed to be representative of the overall composition of the hedge fund universe.” (The 67 funds were chosen because they reported their monthly performance to HedgeFund.net or the Hedge Fund Research Database.) The impacts of these outsized gains, however, largely remain to be felt, as there are only about 125 female-run hedge funds in the world, according to Reuters. Many, including Meredith Jones, the author of the Rothstein Kass report, chalk up these disparities to women’s inherent risk-aversion. Jones called the findings “not surprising,” noting that women’s preferences for financial conservatism have been borne out by countless studies. It’s true: A ton of research backs her up. As unsurprising and clear as these results may be to some, their causes are less easy to identify. While the Catalyst report promotes the idea that women create higher returns, it could be the case that prosperous companies and hedge funds are more likely to hire women. Moreover, those who ascribe one's financial worldview to gender-based differences might be oversimplifying. A 2012 paper took issue with the prevailing line of thinking, arguing that previous research into women’s risk-aversion overstated the differences revealed by the data. In what is probably a healthier way of viewing the world—hedge fund owners and all—the paper suggests that the correlations between gender and risk aversion are “considerably more mixed … than might be expected.” That said, the fact remains that female-led companies and hedge funds are, almost across the board, besting their competitors.

Mario Tama/Getty ImagesOn Monday, shares of for-profit education company ITT Educational fell 46%.  The meltdown in the stock came after ITT disclosed that a deal to sell nearly $120 million worth of real estate assets fell through. CEO Kevin Monday abruptly resigned on the news.  On Tuesday, shares of ITT were up about 0.6%. Following the developments, Timo Connor, an analyst at William Blair, downgraded the stock to "Market Perform from "Outperform."  Connor said in a note to clients following Monday's resignation that, "We do not believe this is evidence of fraud of impropriety... but with the company in a critical period, the lack of a committed senior leader at the helm may cause further fundamental challenges and downward earnings revisions." It's been an ugly year for ITT, which has seen shares fall more than 75% this year. The stock also has a large outstanding short interest, indicating that traders are betting the share price will fall. According to data from FinViz, the percentage of outstanding shares being bet against currently stands at around 47%.  In addition to the company's own struggles, the for-profit education space has been spoken about critically by investors including Mark Cuban and Jim Chanos, as well as regulators including New York Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli.  In his note, Connor also laid out the five things he thinks happen next for the company. 1. Connor expects the company to file its delayed financial statements for last year in mid-August. Connor says the company has until September 15 to file these documents before seeking an additional credit extension from its lender, "so any delay beyond the next few weeks will be perceived as a negative." 2. The company will report results for the second quarter of 2014 after filing its delayed financials. Connor said the risk that ITT cuts its guidance is "substantial." Connor adds that the impact of bad press, as well as the CEOs departure, is "difficult to quantify." 3. Connor expects the Department of Education (DoE) to place the company on "heightened cash monitoring" at some point following the restatement. This would require ITT to post a $98 million letter of credit secured by its lender, Connor says. 4. The DoE could delay disbursement on ITT's federal student loans, but this is seen as "unlikely" by Connor, who notes that the DoE has only done this to one school since 2001.  5. The DoE is set to release gain employment rules in November, and if the Department softens these rules, Connor says this could serve as a catalyst for ITT. If the rules are unchanged, Connor says ITT may need to cut prices, among other measures.  FREE AppDownload
Look around the room at a meeting during your next business trip and try to find that guy — the guy in the wrinkled shirt who may or may not be wearing two slightly different socks. The guy who's going to un-tuck his dress shirt at the bar after dinner to be more "casual." If you don't see this guy, look down. Make sure you're not him. Why? Because you do not want to be this guy. You want to be a gentleman. At some point in every man's life he will have to pack a suit. In fact, he may have to pack up his entire life and be on the move for weeks. Neither of these circumstances are an excuse for not looking fresh. "It comes down to wear-ability, versatility, and then style," says Colin Hunter, co-founder and CEO of men's custom suiting shop, Alton Lane. Hunter himself worked as a consultant for Bain before launching Alton Lane in 2009, and during his time traveling extensively on projects, he perfected the art of looking like a gentleman while living out of a bag. So first, lets talk about wear-ability. Even if you're going to a warmer climate, you don't want any fabric that wrinkles easily. No linen or light wool — in fact toss the light fabrics all together. When it comes to shirts go with broadcloth or oxford over poplin. If you travel a lot, you may even want to invest in a suit made with a material repels water, like Aquaplan by Dormeuil, which Alton Lane carries.  As for versatility — "It's all about efficiency of packing," said Hunter. "Leave the bold patterned suits or blazers at home... You want solid colors you can get more than one use out of — shark skin [gray] or navy." Think seriously about the number of suits you need. They can be re-worn with the right easy-to-pack accessories — like pocket squares, ties, or shirts — to change their look. If you're on a business trip for about a week, bring up to 3 suits. "I try to wear my dress shoes on the flight, even if I'm flying to Hong Kong," said Hunter. "You don't want to be packing shoe trees — [you need one] pair of lace ups, one pair of loafers. I try to stick with brown...it's more versatile, better with navy and gray." If you must bring a black shoe, bring a loafer in brown. This isn't rocket science. Hunter favors putting his suits in garment bag and carrying it on the plane. You can put your loafers and ties in there as well. The garment bag thing is, however, a hot debate. Justin Jeffers, of The Fine Young Gentleman blog told Business Insider that the key is really making sure that everything in your suitcase is tightly packed so there's no movement. "When they are able to shift around a likelihood of creases (and thus ironing) increases...garment bags are a waste of money. You can pack your suit, shoes and shirts in your normal suitcase and they will emerge in a similar, if not a better state." FREE AppDownload
Hugh & CryeSome of the Hugh & Crye team sporting their new T-shirt line.After four years of formal attire, Hugh &amp; Crye, is moving into casual wear. Hugh &amp; Crye is a D.C. menswear company that specializes in a new way of sizing shirts. The company currently offers dress shirts, blazers, ties, and pocket squares, but is launching a T-shirt Kickstarter campaign after hearing requests from some customers for more casual options. Cofounders Pranav Vora and Philip Soriano said the Kickstarter will help support funding for the bootstrapped company, as well as feel out general customer demand. "Guys tend to have this odd relationship with their T-shirts. They tend to be kind of legacy items that are either collegiate wear, or T-shirts that even have holes in them or don't necessarily fit that well," Vora said. "We do get feedback from customers about how they love our dress shirts, but they're looking for the same sort of fit, but something they'd wear on the weekend more causally." There have been many startups born out of a need for better men's fashion and fit: other kickstarter campaigns, personal measuring services, and a rethink for fit with every one.  Vora said all these new entrants are showing men that there's an alternative to malls and department stores. But many custom options still aren't doing the job. "When people often refer to bespoke or custom, they're really talking about made-to-measure," Vora said. "Even with some of these custom offerings on the market, the amount of time it takes to get something made, the number of fittings and measurements that have to be given, the inconvenience really over that period, and sometimes the cost as well, often leads to a product that's not any more well-fitting than what we could have got off the rack." For Hugh &amp; Crye, the focus is on specific body types. The company offers 12 sizes based on three heights (short, average, tall) and four body types (skinny, slim, athletic, and broad). Hugh & CryeVora said he sees the potential of a T-shirt to become one of their core products. The addition of casual clothing will serve a percentage of existing customers, but also expand their customer base to others who don't wear dress clothes frequently. "It's surprising how few people tend to wear button-down dress shirts in Los Angeles," he said, where the T-shirts will be manufactured. Pocket squares and ties are made in the U.S., but Vora said the simplicity of T-shirts will allow for easier domestic production. Dress shirts and blazers are manufactured overseas. The Kickstarter will run for 30 days with a goal of $30,000. If it goes well, Hugh &amp; Crye will incorporate the new T-shirts into its current line of products. T-shirts, around $20 each, come in one, three, six, and ten-packs. You can check out the Kickstarter page here. FREE AppDownload
One former Bridgewater Associates analyst is taking a radical approach to the hedge fund fee compensation structure – he's pretty much ditching it.  Howard Wang, 28, isn't charging a performance fee for his new global macro fund Convoy Investments LLC, Bloomberg News' Kelly Bit reports. Instead, he'll charge only a 1.25% management fee.  It's definitely an interesting approach to attract investors.  Fund managers are paid through a compensation structure commonly known as the "2 and 20," which stands for a 2% management fee and a 20% performance fee charge. More specifically, "2 and 20" means a hedge fund manager would charge investors 2% of total assets under management and 20% of any profits. While "2 and 20" is the standard in the industry (that's what Bridgewater uses), those numbers can vary from fund to fund. Steve Cohen's SAC Capital, for example, charged 3 and 50 and Jim Simons charged 5 and 44.  Lately, it's become harder for fund managers to justify the fee structure, especially because most funds have been underperforming the broader market.  Wang opened his macro fund back in November, and his fund was up 10% this year through June. That's solid performance, because most macro funds have gotten hammered this year.  Right now, it manages only employee and friend/family capital, but he's looking to raise $200 million, the report said. Let's see if Wang starts a trend.  FREE AppDownload
AP PhotoShares of Whole Foods were up more than 4% in morning trade following rumors that Carl Icahn has taken a large stake in the company.  The rumor was first reported by theflyonthewall.com.  Noted investor Doug Kass also commented on Twitter that he was "hearing" Icahn might have taken a position in Whole Foods.  Business Insider left a message with Icahn, but at the time of publishing had not heard back. Citing sources familiar with the situation, Yahoo Finance's Kevin Chupka reported that Icahn has "absolutely no interest in Whole Foods whatsoever."  Following Chupka's report, shares of Whole Foods fell, and had pared gains to about 2.5%.  Tuesday's quick pop in shares of Whole Foods comes amid a terrible year for the organic grocer, which has been one of the worst performing members of the S&amp;P 500 this year. Including Tuesday's advance, shares of Whole Foods were down more than 31% year to date. And following each of the company's three quarterly reports this year, the stock has sold off sharply.  This chart from Google Finance shows Tuesday's action in Whole Foods shares.

Ultimately, stock prices are determined by supply and demand. When more money is seeking fewer shares, stock prices go up. And vice versa. So when you're trying to get a sense of what is driving stock prices, it's smart to look at the changing sources of supply and demand. One big source of demand for stocks in recent years has come from companies buying back their own shares. These buybacks have not just provided extra demand — they have decreased the total supply of shares available. So the buybacks have shifted the supply-demand balance and helped drive stock prices higher. As this chart from FactSet shows, corporate stock buybacks (blue bars) have increased steadily over the past five years. In Q1 of this year, they hit almost the highest level in history — exceeded only by a couple of quarters in 2007, just before the market tanked. FactSet All these buybacks, which have ranged between $75 billion and $159 billion a quarter for the past four years, have provided a steady flow of demand for shares. As the chart below shows, the buybacks have not been offset by new share issuance, so they have modestly reduced the total supply of shares available for S&amp;P 500 companies. The number of shares outstanding is now lower than it was back in 2005, almost 10 years ago. FactSet One important point in the charts above is that corporations usually make the same mistake in buying back their own stocks that many investors make: They buy most aggressively late in bull markets when stocks are about to fall. And then they stop buying when prices plunge and their shares are actually cheap. In so doing, in other words, they squander shareholder capital. But that's a different story. The key point for today's stock market is that, for the past several years, corporate stock buybacks have significantly increased demand for stocks and modestly reduced their supply. And in so doing, they've helped boost stock prices. So now the question is...  How long will corporations keep buying back stock at current or ever-increasing levels? Will this source of demand continue? One way to begin to answer that question is note where the money to buy back stocks is coming from. Some of it is coming from the companies' operating cash flow. As the chart below shows, American companies have had high cash flows over the past several years. (It's worth noting, though, that these cash flows have not increased for the past few years). St. Louis Fed Another big source of cash for buybacks, however, has been debt. As the chart below shows, companies have been borrowing like mad in recent years. And they have been using lots of the cash they borrow to buy back their stock. St. Louis Fed As corporations have borrowed more and more money, the level of corporate debt relative to the size of the economy has continued to increase. As the chart below shows, this ratio is now at its highest level ever — even higher than it was in 2007, before the last debt-fueled economic implosion. Importantly, corporate net debt — the amount of debt that corporations are carrying minus the cash they have on hand (green line below) — is also at its highest level ever as a percent of the economy. Business Insider In other words, corporations have borrowed so much money, in part to buy back their own stocks, that they are "levered" to the gills. What is the maximum debt load that corporations can carry relative to the size of the economy? No one knows. For all we know, we've already exceeded it.  What is clear is that debt capacity depends in large part on interest rates. When rates are very low, as they have been for the past 5 years, corporations (and people) can support much more debt than they can support when interest rates are high. It may be that, if interest rates stay at today's low levels for many more years, corporations can borrow even more money to buy back their own stocks, thus keeping the party going. But, at some point, interest rates are likely to rise. And when interest rates rise, corporations will, at the very least, not be able to continuing borrowing more money at the rate they have been borrowing it. And once they can no longer borrow at the current rate, corporations will have to generate any cash they use to buy back their own stocks from their own cash flow. Or they'll have to stop buying back their stocks. So, at some point, the increased demand and reduced supply from corporate buybacks is likely to, at the very least, lessen. And that could have a, well, adverse effect on stock prices. SEE ALSO: Yes, Stocks Could Drop 50% FREE AppDownload
Alan Sheldon/ShutterstockHome prices (including distressed sales) were up 7.5% year-over-year in June, according to the latest CoreLogic home price report.  This is the 28th straight month of annual home price gains. Home prices were up 1% month-over-month but in seasonally adjusted terms they were "essentially unchanged," according to Matthew Pointon at Capital Economics.  "And downward revisions to the readings in April and May now mean that prices have been more-or-less flat for the past three months." Excluding distressed sales, home prices wre up 6.9% on the year, the slowest pace since the end of 2012. Pointon writes that home price growth is easing as housing supply continues to increase. "The inventory of homes for sale has now risen for four consecutive months, and although partly offset by a rise in existing home sales, the months’ supply of unsold stock has edged up in recent months," he writes. “Home price appreciation continued moderating in June with its slight month-over-month increase,” Mark Fleming, chief economist for CoreLogic said in a press release. “This reversion to normality that we are finally experiencing is expected to continue across the country and should further alleviate concern over diminishing affordability and the risk of another asset bubble.” Here are some details from the report: Here's a chart from Capital Economics that show's the trajectory of home price growth including and excluding distressed sales: Capital Economics FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersFiat logo is seen on a Fiat vehicle displayed outside Chrysler World Headquarters during the FCA Investors Day in Auburn HillsMILAN (Reuters) - Fiat said on Tuesday that Italian media reports about a significant number of its shareholders having exercised their exit rights, a move that could potentially jeopardize the carmaker's merger with its U.S. unit Chrysler, were unfounded. "These rumors are groundless," the company said in a statement. "The term for the exercise of the cash exit rights has begun today and Fiat has not received any notices of exercise of the cash exit rights." Fiat shareholders approved the merger with a two-thirds majority on Friday. Technically the merger could still fail if around 5 percent of all shareholders exercise their rights to sell out, a possibility that analysts and management consider remote. The stock fell more than 4 percent on Tuesday, partially because of concerns over the merger, but also due to a press report in Chinese media regarding a competition probe targeting Chrysler in China.

Thomson ReutersRobotic arms spot welds on the chassis of a Ford Transit Van under assembly at the Ford Claycomo Assembly Plant in ClaycomoWASHINGTON, Aug 5 (Reuters) - New orders for U.S. factory goods rose more than expected in June as demand increased across the board, pointing to a strengthening in manufacturing activity. The Commerce Department said on Tuesday new orders for manufactured goods increased 1.1 percent after a downwardly revised 0.6 percent decline in May. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new orders received by factories rising only 0.6 percent after May's previously reported 0.5 percent fall. Manufacturing is expanding strongly, helping to keep the economy on solid ground. A survey last Friday showing new orders at the nation's factories surged in July. Automobile production is also accelerating. But businesses amassed huge piles of stocks in the second quarter, which they will probably need to work through before placing more orders. That could take some edge off factory activity and overall economic growth. The economy grew at a 4.0 percent annual pace in the April-June period, and growth estimates for the third quarter are currently around a 3 percent rate. Orders excluding the volatile transportation category jumped 1.1 percent in June, the largest increase since July of last year, as bookings for primary metals, machinery and electrical equipment, appliances and components rose. Orders for computers and electronic products also increased. Unfilled orders at factories rose 1.0 percent. Order backlogs have increased in 14 of the last 15 months. The Commerce Department also said orders for durable goods, manufactured products expected to last three years and more, rose a sturdy 1.7 percent in June instead of the 0.7 percent rise reported last month. Durable goods orders excluding transportation surged 1.9 percent instead of the previously reported 0.8 percent advance. Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft - seen as a measure of business confidence and spending plans - increased 3.3 percent, revised up from the 1.4 percent gain reported last month. The factory orders report showed inventories rose 0.3 percent in June, slowing from May's 0.8 percent gain. Shipments rose 0.5 percent after slipping 0.1 percent in May. The inventories-to-shipments ratio was unchanged at 1.31.  ((Reporting By Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Paul Simao)) FREE AppDownload

Financial data firm Markit said its final services Purchasing Managers Index hit 60.8 in July, down from the preliminary reading of 61.0, which was also the reading for June. The 61.0 print for June was the highest final reading for any month since the survey began in October 2009. A reading above 50 signals expansion in economic activity. "The services sector grew at a rapid pace, just slightly weaker than June’s post-recession high, accompanied by a surge in factory production," said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit. "However, there are signs that growth could cool in coming months. The surveys indicate that the rate of job creation has waned, as have inflows of new business." The new business component slipped last month to 57.3, compared to the preliminary reading of 57.6 and June's final 60.8. Confidence about the year-ahead business outlook in the services sector slipped to the lowest since November 2012. Markit's final composite PMI, a weighted average of its manufacturing and services indexes, hit 60.6 in July, also the second-highest final reading on record, versus 61.0 in June and a preliminary 60.9.

Andrew Ross Sorkin over at Dealbook is out with his take on hedge fund manager Bill Ackman and pharmaceutical company Valeant's hostile tag-team attempt to takeover Allergan. "...something hasn't smelled right about these clever machinations," Sorkin writes. "An analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein quite rightly titled a report 'How Can It Be Legal?'" It's a question very much up for debate since last week, when Allergan submitted to a U.S. Court that the takeover attempt is, in fact, illegal. In a lawsuit, the pharma company alleged that Ackman — whose hedge fund Pershing Square owns just under 10% of Allergan — and Valeant were in violation of SEC Rule 14 e-3, which prohibits entities on the verge of making a tender offer — an offer bypassing the board and going directly to shareholders — for a company from disclosing that information. Ackman and Valeant have called the case "frivolous" and "shameless attempt" to delay the takeover. In February, Allergan's complaint alleges, Pershing Square, with a minuscule contribution promised from Valeant, created a shell company called PS1 LLC. The fund then started buying Allergan shares after Valeant started showing signs that it would make a tender offer for Allergan, according to the lawsuit. Meanwhile, Pershing and Valeant allegedly signed an agreement that they would not make a tender offer for Allergan. Allergan submits that that agreement was an attempt to cover their tracks. And Sorkin agrees, pointing out that Pearson said on a conference call: “On April 22, we announced our offer for Allergan. We suspected at the time it would ultimately have to go directly to Allergan shareholders. We were correct.” The day before, on April 21st, according to the lawsuit, Ackman's hedge fund Perhsing Square, amassed a 9.7% stake in Allergan. "The stratagem emphasizes the crying need for the SEC to bring its early-warning rules into the 21st century," wrote a team of lawyers from Wachtel, Lipton, Rosen and Katz shortly after the deal was announced. That team included famed anti-activist investing (no fan of Bill Ackman) attorney, Martin Lipton. But they ultimately determined it wasn't illegal — just questionable. This is what a lot of lawyers were saying after the deal was announced. It's why Sorkin called the deal "too clever by half." It's why, when it came time for Ackman's and Valeant's PR people to respond to Allergan's lawsuit, these 'it's not legal but it is questionable' memos were attached to their statement. But as Sorkin points out, and Lipton and his team wrote — "The structure is crafty, and good for Valeant and Pershing Square (as long as no bad facts emerge, such as undisclosed arrangements, that could get them in trouble)." Quite a caveat.   FREE AppDownload

ReutersInterim president, CEO and CFO of Target John Mulligan listens to a question while testifying at the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing about Privacy in the Digital Age on Capitol Hill.Target's data breach just got more expensive. In a statement, the retailer said its second quarter earnings will include a $148 million charge related to losses regarding the massive data breach which occurred during last year's holiday shopping season.  The company said this estimate includes, "an increase to the accrual for estimated probably losses for what the Company believes to be the vast majority of actual and potential breach-related claims, including claims by payment card networks." "Since the data breach last December, we have been focused on providing clarity on the Company’s estimated financial exposure to breach-related claims," said John Mulligan, interim president and CEO, CFO of Target. "With the benefit of additional information, we believe that today is an appropriate time to provide greater clarity on this topic." And in addition to increasing costs stemming from this data breach, Target also cut its second quarter earnings outlook.  The company said it expects adjusted EPS to be around $0.78, lower than then $0.85-$1.00 it previously expected. Target said this outlook reflects flat sales in the U.S. and softer-than-expected sales in its Canadian segment.  In pre-market trading, shares of Target were down as much as 4%.  FREE AppDownload

Thomson ReutersA trader works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in New YorkNEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures dipped on Tuesday after China's economic recovery was put in doubt as growth in its services sector slowed in July to its lowest level in nearly nine years. China's services purchasing managers' index fell to 50.0 in July from a 15-month high of 53.1 in June, the lowest since November 2005 when the data collection began. The data was partly offset by expansion in the euro zone's services sector at the second-fastest pace in three years. However, deflationary pressures continued to weigh on the region. Two separate readings on the U.S. services sector are due in the first half hour after the market opens on Tuesday. S&amp;P 500 e-mini futures were down 5.5 points and fair value - a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract - indicated a lower open. Dow Jones industrial average e-mini futures fell 35 points and Nasdaq 100 e-mini futures lost 9.5 points. Gannett Co shares rose 6.3 percent in premarket trading after the publisher of USA Today said it would take full ownership of automotive website Cars.com and spin off its publishing assets into a publicly traded company as it focuses on its digital businesses. Coach shares added 7.5 percent premarket after the high-end retailer reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue helped by a rise in sales in international markets. Shares of solar and LED equipment maker GT Advanced Technologies rose 10.5 percent premarket a day after it  raised the lower end of its full-year 2014 adjusted profit forecast, citing higher gross margins for the second half of the year. Online coupon company RetailMeNot shares tumbled 22.1 percent premarket after it forecast quarterly revenue below analysts' average estimate.

Dr. Ed's BlogStock market investors have been jittery since the start of the year mostly because valuations have been stretched. That’s been especially noticeable in the performance of the SmallCaps. It’s also been reflected in the P/E-led correction in the stock market. On the other hand, industry analysts remain very upbeat on the outlook for earnings, especially forward earnings. As long as their optimism continues, it should offset investors’ jitters about valuation. Consider the following recent developments: (1) Forward P/Es. There has been a significant correction in the forward P/Es of the S&amp;P 500/400/600, especially for the SmallCaps. The forward P/E for the S&amp;P 600 peaked at 19.3 on March 18 of this year and was down to 17.2 as of yesterday. It remains 11% below this year’s peak. The S&amp;P 400’s forward P/E of 16.6 is down 6% from the year’s peak of 17.7 on March 4. This valuation multiple rose to a bull market high of 15.7 for the S&amp;P 500 on July 3. It was down only 3% since then to 15.2 yesterday. (2) Forward earnings. Helping to offset the drop in these valuation multiples are the solid performances of forward earnings. Indeed, they rose to new record highs for the S&amp;P 500/400/600 last week. They’ve been doing so at a faster pace in recent weeks. Today's Morning Briefing: Secular Stagnation? (1) Updating the “Great Rotation.” (2) Good, not great. (3) How much longer will money rotate from SmallCaps to LargeCaps? (4) Jittery investors lower P/Es, while analysts raise E estimates. (5) Forward P/Es cheaper, but not cheap. (6) Forward earnings making new highs. (7) Larry Summers is an important fellow with a debatable thesis. (8) Less support for his secular stagnation hypothesis in the labor market. (9) Consumers are earning more and spending more. (10) Focus on market-weight-rated S&amp;P 500 auto-related industries. (More for subscribers.) Dr. Ed's Blog FREE AppDownload

REUTERS/Navesh ChitrakarA briefcase with a hidden gun belonging to security personnel is seen during India Prime Minister Narendra Modi's meeting with Nepali Prime Minister Sushil Koirala in Kathmandu. Modi embarked on a visit to Nepal on Sunday to help speed up negotiations on a power trade pact that is at the center of a new effort to improve ties with a neighbor that serves as a buffer with China.Good morning! Here's what you need to know. 1.  Israel Withdraws From Gaza. Forces withdrew in advance of a 72-hour ceasefire brokered by Egypt, and after Israel had announced it had completed its mission to destroy Hamas tunnels. "Hamas and Islamic Jihad appeared ready for the conflict to come to a halt," The New York Times' Steven Erlanger reported. "They accepted an Egyptian proposal little changed from one that they had rejected earlier in the conflict; an earlier American attempt at a similar cease-fire also broke down quickly." 2.  NYC Patient "Unlikely To Have Ebola." Manhattan's Mount Sinai Hospital announced it was still testing a patient admitted with troubling symptoms to definitively rule out the virus but that it seemed like it was likely something else.  3.  Huge Russia Troop Buildup. The New York Times' Michael Gordon and Eric Schmitt say Vladimir Putin has now amassed an additional 17 battalions and up to 21,000 troops on the Ukrainian border, but no one is sure what his gameplan is. Officials' biggest fear is an invasion under the guise of a "peacekeeping" operation. "That’s a very real option," a senior Defense Department official told The Times. "And should Putin decide, he could do that with little or no notice. We just don’t know what he’s thinking." 4.  Fox And Time Warner. Both companies report earnings Wednesday, and we will thus get a chance to learn where each stands on Fox's takeover bid. "It will be an opportunity for Time Warner Chief Executive Jeff Bewkes to defend his record for shareholder value," Reuters' Jennifer Saba said. "Fox's Chief Operating Officers Chase Carey and James Murdoch will have the chance to discuss the more than $1 billion in cost savings and powerful combination of cable networks and sports programming. It is unclear whether Rupert Murdoch, chairman and CEO of Fox, will make an appearance given the stakes." 5.  Earnings. Tuesday morning gets Coach, CVS, Icahn Enterprises, MGM Resorts, Monster Worldwide, and Office Depot. After the bell we get Disney, First Solar, Groupon, Potbelly, and Zillow.   6.  Strong Quarters For BMW and Toyota. Both reported earnings that topped prior-year readings. Toyota saw strong sales in North America, the FT said, while BMW posted its best profitability in three years, Bloomberg's Elisabeth Behrmann said. Shares went nowhere for Toyota in Japan trading, but BMW shares were up 0.8% in Germany.    7.  AIG Tops Expectations. Shares climbed more than 2% after-hours Monday after the financial giant reported earnings that topped expectations. The firm also announced it had paid $960 million to settle a bailout-era shareholder class-action lawsuit that had sought $100 billion in compensation over fraud claims. After-tax operating income per share hit $1.25 versus $1.05 expected. Q2 net premiums earned totaled $8.53 billion, up 2% from the $8.35 billion earned a year ago. 8.  Gannett Splitting Up. The McLean, Va.-based firm will become two separate publicly traded companies — one focused on broadcast and digital, the other publishing. The firm will also buy out Cars.com. Shares were up 9% in pre-market trading Tuesday. On Monday, BI's Myles' Udland explained how you would have seen more than a 1,436% return if you had invested in Gannett when its stock bottomed in 2009.  9.  Data. Three important releases on Tuesday. At 9:45 a.m. we get services data from Markit Economics. Consensus is for a reading of 61, unchanged from the prior reading. Then at 10 a.m. we get factory orders from the Census. Consensus is for a gain 0f 0.6% after a decline of 0.5% prior. Then we get non-manufacturing data from the Institute for Supply Management. Expectations are for a reading of 56.5, up from 56.0 prior. 10.  Markets. U.S. futures were down 0.1% to 0.2%. London's FTSE climbed 0.4%. Germany's DAX was up 0.6%. Japan's Nikkei closed down 1%.  FREE AppDownload

Leigh Vogel/Getty Gannett is spinning off its publishing business from its broadcasting and digital operations. The company is also acquiring full ownership of Cars.com for $1.8 billion. It follows the Tribune Co., Time Warner Inc., and News Corp. in breaking off print media from its rapidly expanding broadcast operations. Gannett Co. said Tuesday that the publishing business would basically be free of debt once spun off, with the broadcasting and digital businesses holding the existing debt. The publishing business will keep the Gannett name, while the broadcasting and digital company has yet to be named. Both companies will remain headquartered in McLean, Virginia. Gannett is buying the 73 percent interest in Classified Ventures LLC, owner of Cars.com, that it doesn't already own. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter. Shares of Gannett Co. Inc. were up 6.35% in pre-market trading Tuesday morning. "These transformative transactions will give both the Publishing company and the Broadcasting and Digital company enhanced strategic, operating, financial, and regulatory flexibility to pursue growth and consolidation opportunities in their respective markets, while delivering strong cash flow to build further upon Gannett's long-standing traditions of award-winning journalism and service to our local communities," president and CEO Gracia Martore said in a statement. "We are creating two companies that will be among the largest and strongest in their peer groups, with increased abilities to focus resources on the most promising areas of their businesses."

flickr/argenbergCAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt is planning to build a new Suez Canal alongside the near-145 year-old historic waterway in a multi-billion dollar project aimed at expanding trade along the fastest shipping route betweenEurope and Asia. The new canal is expected to cost $4 billion, Mohab Mamishm, the chairman of the Suez Canal Authority said on Tuesday during a conference broadcast by state television. "This giant project will be the creation of a new Suez Canal parallel to the current channel of a total length of 72 kilometres (44.74 miles)," Mohab Mamish, chairman of the Suez Canal Authority, told the conference in Ismailia, a port town on the Canal.  The current Suez Canal brings in around $5 billion of revenues per year, a vital source of hard currency forEgypt which has suffered a slump in tourism and foreign investment since its 2011 uprising. To attract more ships and generate more income, the country has had plans to develop 76,000 square kilometres (29,000 square miles) around the canal for years. Mamish spoke at a conference in which President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi is expected to announce a winning consortium to develop the project, which includes building an international industrial and logistics hub in theSuez Canal area. Mamish said the project would involve 35 kilometres ( miles) of "dry digging" and 37 kilometres ( miles) would be "expansion and deepening", indicating the current Suez Canal, which is 163 km (101 miles) long, could be widened as part of the project.

Google EarthThe housing recovery has been slowing and home price growth is starting to cool. In fact Case-Shiller home prices fell 0.3% month-over-month in June.  But there are pockets of the country where housing is rapidly heating up. The real estate brokerage Redfin says that the up-and-coming areas are "mostly adjacent to highly sought-after neighborhoods that have become difficult to get into because of high prices and few homes for sale." Redfin used its own proprietary website data to figure out which neighborhoods are about to get hot. By looking at the neighborhoods at which more and more people are looking on the website, they're able to make a guess about what housing markets are about to get hot. To rank the top 10, Redfin looked at year-over-year increase in the average numbers of page views and favorites per home, as well as the changes in rank. FREE AppDownload
BILONDON (Reuters) - European shares eked out gains on Tuesday driven by upbeat earnings from a number of blue-chip companies, while the euro fell to the day's low after a broadly disappointing set of services activity data. Investors were cheered by strong results from German luxury carmaker BMW andFrance's third biggest listed bank Credit Agricole, among others, enabling European equities to buck the trend in Asian markets which were hit by weak Chinese data. But the gains appeared fragile ahead of a U.S. survey that could cast fresh light on the pace of recovery in the world's biggest economy. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index &lt;.FTEU3&gt; of blue-chips was up 0.5 percent at 1,333.78, a small recovery from its near 4 percent fall over the past two weeks. The index has been pummelled by concerns about a tightening of U.S. monetary policy, financial trouble at BES and political tensions, notably in Ukraine and Gaza. With all these concerns still present in the market, traders said the downtrend may resume shortly. "Nothing has materially changed since last week," Jonathan Sudaria, a dealer at Capital Spreads, said. "The down-move may have stalled and some markets have had a modest uptick, but traders are already framing this as a textbook dead cat bounce." Asian shares fell after the China services purchasing managers' index (PMI) compiled by HSBC/Markit fell to 50.0 in July from a 15-month high of 53.1 in June. It was the lowest reading since November 2005 when the data collection began, indicating a recovery in the broader economy is still fragile and may need further government support. EURO WOES The euro fell to $1.3395 &lt;EUR=&gt; after subdued services PMI data from the euro zone, with initial declines sparked by the reading from Italy's Markit/ADACI Business activity index. The print eased to 52.8 in July from 53.9 in June. Economists in a Reuters poll had expected 54.0. The broad euro zone PMI figure of 54.2 came in slightly below expectations. "It (the euro) certainly has reacted negatively to the Italian numbers," said Neil Mellor, a currency strategist with Bank of New York Mellon in London. "On the main numbers even 54 is not exactly a figure that sets the world alight. It returns us to what we've been seeing for a few weeks now - that the momentum inEurope is faltering." Focus was now on the corresponding U.S. survey due later in the day and expected to show a robust reading. The dollar held below a 10-1/2-month peak against a basket of currencies &lt;.DXY&gt; and was little changed at 102.495 yen &lt;JPY=&gt;, well below the four-month peak of 103.15 hit last week. The greenback was capped by a fall in Treasury yields overnight after weaker-than-expected U.S. non-farm payrolls data on Friday knocked it off the 103 threshold. Treasury yields fell as the bond market retained its bullish tone after rallying Friday on the jobs report. In commodities, Brent held steady above $105 a barrel despite ample supplies, underpinned by political tension in the Middle East and North Africa and expectations that data will show a further draw on U.S. crude inventories last week. Brent crude &lt;LCOc1&gt; rose for the second straight session, climbing 14 cents to $105.55 after gaining 57 cents on Monday.  (Additional reporting by Francesco Canepa and Patrick Graham, editing by John Stonestreet) FREE AppDownload
Earlier this year, I posted some demographic data for the U.S., see: Census Bureau: Largest 5-year Population Cohort is now the "20 to 24" Age Group and The Future is still Bright!I pointed out that "even without the financial crisis we would have expected some slowdown in growth this decade (just based on demographics). The good news is that will change soon."Changes in demographics are an important determinant of economic growth, and although most people focus on the aging of the "baby boomer" generation, the movement of younger cohorts into the prime working age is another key story in coming years. Here is a graph of the prime working age population (this is population, not the labor force) from 1948 through July 2014.  Calculated Risk There was a huge surge in the prime working age population in the 1970s, '80s, and '90s — and the prime age population has been mostly flat recently (even declined a little).The prime working age labor force grew even quicker than the population in the 1970s and '80s because of the increase in participation of women. In fact, the prime working age labor force was increasing more than 3% per year in the '80s.So when we compare economic growth with that of the 1970s, '80, or 90's, we have to remember this difference in demographics (the '60s saw solid economic growth as near-prime age groups increased sharply).The prime working age population peaked in 2007, and it appears to have bottomed at the end of 2012. The good news is the prime working age group has started to grow again and should be growing solidly by 2020 — and this should boost economic activity in the years ahead. The second shows prime and near-prime working age population in the U.S. since 1948 (this is population, not labor force). Calculated RiskThe near-prime group has still been growing — especially the 55 to 64 age group.The key points are:1) A slowdown in the U.S. was expected this decade just based on demographics (the housing bust and financial crisis were piled on top of weak demographics). 2) The prime working age population in the U.S. will start growing solidly again soon.  FREE AppDownload
AP Photo/Robert F. BukatyWASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama will announce on Tuesday that U.S. businesses have committed to investing $14 billion in construction, clean energy, banking, and information technology projects across Africa, a White House official said. The announcement will occur at the U.S.-Africa Business Forum, part of a three-day Africa summit in Washington meant to showcase U.S. interest in improving trade and investment in the region. "These investments will deepen U.S. economic engagement in Africa, fueling growth that will support broader African prosperity and emerging markets for US businesses, which will support jobs in both the United Statesand Africa," the White House official said. Obama will take part in a discussion with corporate chief executives and government leaders at the event, which will be attended by Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, and former President Bill Clinton. The business forum will allow dozens of African heads of state to mingle with U.S. and African executives, the official said. It will focus broadly on investment in finance, infrastructure, energy, agriculture, and consumer goods. More than 90 U.S. companies are slated to participate including Chevron Corp &lt;CVX.N, Citigroup Inc, Ford Motor Co, General Electric Co, Lockheed Martin Corp, Marriott International Inc, Morgan Stanley and Wal-MartStores Inc. Several African companies were also expected to attend. In a brief preview of Obama's remarks, the White House did not give specifics on the nature of the business deals or identify which companies were involved. "These agreements represent conclusive evidence that America is open for more business with Africa as the Continent’s economic ascent is just beginning," Pritzker said in a statement. "Each day, 250,000 Americans go to work in jobs supported by exports to Africa and these deals will lead to increased prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic in the months ahead," she said. The Obama administration has billed the summit as the first of its kind, but it comes long after Africa gatherings hosted in recent years by China, India, Japan and Europe, suggesting the United States is largely playing a game of catch-up for access to a market in several growing industries.

Thomson ReutersA Toyota logo is seen on a car inside a showroom at a Toyota dealership in WarsawTOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp  posted a forecast-beating 4.4 percent rise in April-June operating profit and raised its North America vehicle sales target for the year to next March, boosted by strong sales of SUVs and pickup trucks in the United States, its biggest market. Toyota, the world's best-selling automaker, said on Tuesday its first-quarter operating profit was 692.7 billion yen (4 billion pounds), exceeding the 637.3 billion yen mean estimate of 13 analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. North America operating profit for the period rose 45 percent to 149.7 billion yen, the company said, adding that cost cuts and a weaker yen also helped to bolster earnings. For the year to March 2015, Toyota stuck with its full-year operating profit forecast of 2.3 trillion yen. That would be a record high, although just a 0.3 percent increase from a year earlier as the tailwind from a weaker yen that helped boost export profits runs out of steam. For the current calendar year, the company trimmed its global groupwide sales forecast to 10.22 million vehicles, a reduction of 110,000 vehicles, reflecting weakness in emerging markets. "Conditions in Thailand, India, Brazil and other emerging markets are weak," Managing Officer Koki Konishi told an earnings briefing. "But we're trying our best to get an additional 50,000 vehicles out of Japan to offset some of that, and to reach around 2.3 million in the U.S." For the financial year to March, Toyota raised its North America sales projection to 2.71 million vehicles from 2.62 million. In July, Toyota's total U.S. sales rose 12 percent, surpassing Ford Motor Co  to become the No.2 seller for the month. The full-year sales target for Asia excluding Japan was trimmed to 1.58 million vehicles from 1.63 million, while Europe was nudged up to 860,000 from 850,000. Japan was left unchanged at 2.21 million. The financial year forecasts are consolidated figures and exclude sales to certain regions including China. A sales-tax hike in Japan in April dented demand for new cars and Toyota's April-June domestic sales dropped 9.6 percent year-on-year to 319,460 vehicles. Toyota's shares ended flat at 6,042 yen before the earnings announcement, compared with a 1 percent drop in Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei average . For the year to date, both Toyota and the benchmark have fallen 6 percent.   (Reporting by Yoko Kubota; Editing by Matt Driskill) FREE AppDownload
Fresh evidence emerged yesterday that Scotland's major financial institutions might flee the country if the Scottish vote for independence in September. Standard Life, the insurance company that employs 5,000 people in Scotland, again hinted it would consider leaving, the Financial Times reported. "We are not disclosing any specific details around our contingency plans," a spokesperson for Standard Life told Business Insider this morning. (That statement appears to imply that the company does indeed have "contingency plans" for the vote — it just doesn't want to talk about them.) According to a transcript, David Nish, the company's CEO, told analysts on yesterday's call: What we will continue to do is look at different ways of how we could maybe react post significant constitutional change. I know there has been some speculation in the press that we have been searching for office buildings in London etc., but we have confirmed that was just normal investment work that Keith’s business (Standard Life Investments) has ended up doing. I am comfortable with the progress we are making but I am not going to go into any details about the steps that we are taking. We are getting so close now to the Referendum that we will be able to understand better in 45 days time potentially what the consequences could be. That "speculation" came in February when it was reported the company was drawing up contingency plans to relocate to England if the Scots vote "yes" on independence in their upcoming referendum. The fear is that an independent Scotland would create a financial exodus from North of the border. A new Scotland could be temporarily forced out of the European Union — leading to a mountain of regulatory red tape — and the country might not be able to control its own currency or back the assets held in Scottish banks. Standard Life / YouTubeStandard Life chief David NishStandard Life held its half-year results call yesterday: ... David Nish, chief executive of the Edinburgh-based financial services group, said: “We do not believe that further clarity has been provided on any of these issues.” ... The company, based in Scotland since 1825, has since been registering corporate entities in England and holding talks with prudential regulators as part of contingency plans. He also said the company had not spent a "material sum" drawing up contingency plans. The problem for Scottish nationalists here is that with the vote only weeks away, few big financial institutions are giving any concrete commitments to staying in the country if the poll goes the wrong way. In February, Standard Life said it could transfer operations to England and was already registering its companies in the South. Even RBS — the Royal Bank of Scotland — has failed to give a full-on commitment to the would-be nation after which it has been named. Earlier in August it said independence could have "a material adverse effect" on the company:  “Uncertainties resulting from an affirmative vote ... would be likely to significantly impact the group’s credit ratings and could also impact the fiscal, monetary, legal and regulatory landscape to which the group is subject. “Were Scotland to become independent, it may also affect Scotland’s status in the EU. The occurrence of any of the impacts above could significant impact the group’s costs and would have a material adverse effect on the group’s business, financial conditions, results of operations and prospects.” FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersA Toyota logo is seen on a car inside a showroom at a Toyota dealership in WarsawTOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp  posted a forecast-beating 4.4 percent rise in April-June operating profit and raised its North America vehicle sales target for the year to next March, boosted by strong sales of SUVs and pickup trucks in the United States, its biggest market. Toyota, the world's best-selling automaker, said on Tuesday its first-quarter operating profit was 692.7 billion yen (4 billion pounds), exceeding the 637.3 billion yen mean estimate of 13 analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. North America operating profit for the period rose 45 percent to 149.7 billion yen, the company said, adding that cost cuts and a weaker yen also helped to bolster earnings. For the year to March 2015, Toyota stuck with its full-year operating profit forecast of 2.3 trillion yen. That would be a record high, although just a 0.3 percent increase from a year earlier as the tailwind from a weaker yen that helped boost export profits runs out of steam. For the current calendar year, the company trimmed its global groupwide sales forecast to 10.22 million vehicles, a reduction of 110,000 vehicles, reflecting weakness in emerging markets. "Conditions in Thailand, India, Brazil and other emerging markets are weak," Managing Officer Koki Konishi told an earnings briefing. "But we're trying our best to get an additional 50,000 vehicles out of Japan to offset some of that, and to reach around 2.3 million in the U.S." For the financial year to March, Toyota raised its North America sales projection to 2.71 million vehicles from 2.62 million. In July, Toyota's total U.S. sales rose 12 percent, surpassing Ford Motor Co  to become the No.2 seller for the month. The full-year sales target for Asia excluding Japan was trimmed to 1.58 million vehicles from 1.63 million, while Europe was nudged up to 860,000 from 850,000. Japan was left unchanged at 2.21 million. The financial year forecasts are consolidated figures and exclude sales to certain regions including China. A sales-tax hike in Japan in April dented demand for new cars and Toyota's April-June domestic sales dropped 9.6 percent year-on-year to 319,460 vehicles. Toyota's shares ended flat at 6,042 yen before the earnings announcement, compared with a 1 percent drop in Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei average . For the year to date, both Toyota and the benchmark have fallen 6 percent.   (Reporting by Yoko Kubota; Editing by Matt Driskill) FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Rick Wilking/filesRupert Murdoch, CEO of 21st Century Fox, and Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes at the Allen and Co. media conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, in a combination of July 11 and July 9.Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox Inc. is expected to make an aggressive case for merging with Time Warner Inc. during its quarterly earnings call on Wednesday, though people familiar with the company's plans have said it would not use that forum to raise its bid. Time Warner is due to report its financial results on Wednesday as well, marking the first time executives from both companies will publicly speak since the offer was first revealed on July 16. It will be an opportunity for Time Warner Chief Executive Jeff Bewkes to defend his record for shareholder value. Fox's Chief Operating Officers Chase Carey and James Murdoch will have the chance to discuss the more than $1 billion in cost savings and powerful combination of cable networks and sports programming. It is unclear whether Rupert Murdoch, chairman and CEO of Fox, will make an appearance given the stakes. Fox has offered to buy Time Warner for about $80 billion, or about $85 per share, in a mix of cash and stock. Time Warner turned it down, saying its plan to go it alone was "superior to any proposal" from Fox. Though Fox is expected to raise its offer, it will not rise beyond the range of $90 to $95 per share, a person familiar with Fox told Reuters on July 25. The timing of another offer is unclear. Some analysts have said that an even higher bid would be needed to win over Time Warner management and shareholders. A spokesman for Fox declined to comment. A potential tie-up would create one of the world's largest media conglomerates, dominating content production with two major studios, a stable of cable networks like Fox News and TNT, broadcast networks and pay-TV channel HBO. Faced with a rash of media distribution mergers, such as Comcast Corp.'s proposed $45 billion takeover of Time Warner Cable and AT&amp;T's $48.5 billion deal to buy DirecTV, programming creators are responding with their own potential deals to add clout for negotiations with cable and satellite distributors and new entrants like Netflix and Amazon. Bernstein Research analyst Todd Juenger wrote in a note to investors on Friday that it would be in the interest of both companies to ink a deal. He and his team spoke to hundreds of Fox and Time Warner shareholders and concluded that "most people are supportive." "To reject the $85 a share offer, you would have to believe that Time Warner would get to $95 a share on its own," he wrote. "We don't find very many people who think it will be easy to get there." A Time Warner spokesman declined to comment. With a backdrop of a rebuffed deal, Time Warner will be on the hook to explain why it is better off going solo. Time Warner has outpaced its peers with 15.2 percent earnings per share growth for the past five years, nearly double the median for its competitors, according to Thomson Reuters data. "Can Time Warner demonstrate to shareholders that left alone, the value to shareholders would be meaningfully greater than the $85 bid on the table from Fox?" Alan Gould, managing director at Evercore Partners Inc., asked in a research note. For now, Gould pointed out that there did not seem to be an alternative bidder.

Thomson ReutersC-class by Daimler AG is pictured before company's annual news conference in StuttgartBy Norihiko Shirouzu and Samuel Shen BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Daimler AG's  luxury brand Mercedes-Benz said it is cooperating with China's anti-monopoly authorities over an investigation into unspecified matters, after local Chinese media reported the German automaker's Shanghai office had been raided. "We confirm that we are assisting the authorities in their investigation," Mercedes-Benz said in a statement, issued in response to a query from Reuters on whether the office had received anti-trust officials from the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC). Asked about the nature of the investigation, Beijing-based Mercedes-Benz spokesman Senol Bayrak said the automaker is only confirming that anti-trust officials visited the office as part of an investigation. He declined to elaborate, saying it is "an on-going matter". A little-known Shanghai publication known as Jie Mian reported nine officials from the NDRC's anti-trust investigation team sprung a surprise visit at Mercedes-Benz's Shanghai office on Monday morning. The publication said the team interviewed many senior executives and confiscated computers as part of an investigation blitz into Mercedes-Benz. Over the weekend before, Mercedes-Benz said it would lower prices on more than 10,000 spare parts by an average of 15 percent. The cut followed a sweeping reduction of prices for repair and maintenance services Mercedes-Benz announced last month. The automaker is the latest foreign company to be targeted by Chinese regulators, who have ramped up anti-monopoly investigations in industries ranging from pharmaceuticals to electronics. Regulators officially named U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm Inc  a monopoly last month and are widely expected to levy a heavy fine. Last week, agency investigators raided Microsoft Corp's  offices in four Chinese cities as part of an ongoing probe. China is stepping up efforts to bring companies into compliance with an anti-monopoly law enacted in 2008, having in recent years targeted industries as varied as milk powder and jewelery. Such investigations have led to substantial fines at a number multinational companies, including Mead Johnson Nutrition Co  and Danone SA .

REUTERS/Victor FraileTOKYO (Reuters) - Asian stocks slipped on Tuesday after a survey showed China's services sector growth fell to a record low, souring the positive mood from upbeat U.S. earnings and relief over Portugal's rescue of its largest bank. Spreadbetters saw Europe faring better, with Capital Spreads expecting Britain's FTSE &lt;.FTSE&gt; to open 0.1 percent higher, Germany's DAX &lt;.GDAXI&gt; 0.5 percent, and France's CAC &lt;.FCHI&gt; 0.4 percent. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan &lt;.MIAPJ0000PUS&gt; fell 0.4 percent, turning negative after the China services purchasing managers' index (PMI) compiled by HSBC/Markit fell to 50.0 in July from a 15-month high of 53.1 in June. It was the lowest reading since November 2005 when the data collection began, indicating a recovery in the broader economy is still fragile and may need further government support. "The weakness in the headline number likely reflects the impact of the ongoing property slowdown in many cities as property related activity, such as agencies and residential services, see less business," said HSBC's China Chief economist Qu Hongbin. Tokyo's Nikkei &lt;.N225&gt; fell 0.5 percent and mainland Chinese shares slipped 0.5 percent &lt;.CSI300&gt; from a seven-month high hit just before the data. U.S. stocks had rallied on Monday, lifted by Portugal's decision to rescue Banco Espirito Santo &lt;BES.LS&gt; and earnings from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway&lt;BRKa.N&gt; &lt;BRKb.N&gt;. [.N] The Australian dollar received a small boost, paring earlier losses after the Reserve Bank of Australia stopped short of actively jawboning the currency lower. As widely expected, Australia's central bank kept its cash rate at a record low of 2.5 percent to mark a full year without a change, and the inaction looks likely to stretch for some time yet as the economy copes with a cooling mining boom. The Aussie nudged up 0.1 percent to an intraday high of $0.9344 after dropping to as low as $0.9316 &lt;AUD=D4&gt;. It has plumbed on Monday a two-month low of $0.9275. The U.S. dollar was little changed at 102.495 yen &lt;JPY=&gt;, well below the four-month peak of 103.15 hit last week. The greenback was capped by a fall in Treasury yields overnight after weaker-than-expected U.S. non-farm payrolls data on Friday knocked it off the 103 threshold. Treasury yields fell as the bond market retained its bullish tone after rallying Friday on the jobs report. The euro was also effectively flat, at $1.3421 &lt;EUR=&gt; after being hoisted from eight-month lows below $1.34 in wake of Friday's U.S. jobs data release. The euro has made little further headway since Friday's bounce, weighed by caution ahead of a European Central Bank meeting on Thursday. In commodities, Brent held steady above $105 a barrel despite ample crude supplies, underpinned by political tension in the Middle East and North Africa and expectations that data will show a further draw on U.S. crude inventories last week. [O/R] Brent crude &lt;LCOc1&gt; rose for the second straight session, climbing 14 cents to $105.55 after gaining 57 cents on Monday. (Editing by Kim Coghill &amp; Shri Navaratnam) FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersA Wall Street sign is pictured in the rain outside the New York Stock ExchangeBy Greg Roumeliotis NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street banks have found a U.S. review of their junk-rated loans to have yielded similar results to last year, easing some concern among bankers about a crackdown on one of their most lucrative businesses. The Office of the Comptroller of Currency, the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, in an annual process called the Shared National Credit (SNC) review, examined bank portfolios for compliance with guidelines on leveraged loans that limit how much debt a company can take on. Contrary to some bankers' expectations that excessive violations would be discovered, the SNC review's findings are comparable to last year's, according to banking sources. The sources didn't provide details on the review's findings. "Our banking members have said that the SNC review has gone mostly as expected, and is mostly in line with last year," said Meredith Coffey, executive vice president of the trade group Loan Syndications &amp; Trading Association. That suggests a benign outcome for the industry, were it to be confirmed by regulators. It could provide banks with a measure of relief at a time when many of their historically profitable businesses are under pressure. Making junk-rated loans to companies is a lucrative, high-margin business for major Wall Street banks. Last year leveraged loans generated $1.47 billion in fees in the United States alone. The top five issuers of such loans so far this year have been JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co , Bank of America Corp , Wells Fargo &amp; Co  , Credit Suisse Group AG  and Deutsche Bank AG . The last SNC review was published in September 2013 and covered $800 billion of $3 trillion in credit commitments, with a focus on leveraged loans. Regulators also expressed dissatisfaction with the results of that review. The 2013 SNC review found that "criticized" assets, which are considered by regulators to be problematic, represented 10 percent of the SNC portfolio, down from 11 percent in 2012 but twice the percentage of pre-financial crisis levels. Credits rated "special mention" -- a catch-all category for loans that may seem fine now but regulators suspect may exhibit weakness in the future -- increased from $99 billion to $115 billion, representing about 4 percent of the portfolio. It could not be learned, however, whether regulators planned to take any action against individual banks as a result of this year's review, the results of which are due to be published in the autumn. Spokespeople for the OCC, the Fed and the FDIC declined to comment. Bank of America, Credit Suisse and Wells Fargo declined to comment, while JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank did not respond to requests for comment.   Leveraged loan issuance has kept a robust pace as investors chase yield amid the Fed’s cheap money policy. Issuers such as private equity portfolio companies have used that demand to issue junk-rated loans and pay themselves dividends or do more acquisitions. U.S. leveraged loan issuance reached $527 billion in the first half of 2014. Last year, it reached a record $1.14 trillion, up 72 percent from the year before, according to Thomson Reuters Loan Pricing Corp. The regulatory guidelines do not set an absolute limit on leverage, and instead say that loans that would increase the borrower's debt levels to more than 6 times its cash flow raise "concerns for most industries". The percentage of leveraged buyouts with leverage over six times has risen to 55 percent so far this year from zero in 2009. It is now flirting with the 57 percent all-time high seen in 2007, prior to the financial crisis. In the previous SNC review, published in September 2013, regulators had expressed dissatisfaction with the results. The Fed and the OCC have also sent private letters to banks last year expressing concerns about it, sources have previously said. In recent comments, Fed Chair Janet Yellen also said lower-rated corporate debt was an area where "valuations appear stretched". Some bankers said they feared regulators may still crack down on them, using criteria in the guidelines that are more subjective, such as the fuzziness around the leverage threshold. They said regulators have been strict about some elements of their guidance, which has boosted compliance. For example, there is no flexibility in the underwriting requirement that the borrower should be able to fully repay senior secured debt - or at least half of its total debt - over five to seven years.

Thomson ReutersCustomers attend a workshop about the Samsung Galaxy S5 in JakartaSEOUL (Reuters) - A Chinese subsidiary of Shinyang Engineering Co Ltd  will resume supplying parts to Samsung Electronics Co Ltd on Tuesday, a Shinyang official said, less than a month after business ties were suspended over child labor allegations. In July, Samsung Electronics  halted business with Dongguan Shinyang Electronics Co Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Shinyang Engineering, after a U.S.-based activist group said it found at least five child workers without contracts at the Guangdong province-based supplier. The suspension was prompted by a report released earlier in July by China Labor Watch, which said children were working on the assembly lines at Dongguan Shinyang. In June, an independent audit by Samsung Electronics of the maker of mobile phone covers and parts had found no child labor at the supplier. A third-party firm supplying workers had brought in child laborers around the end of June with forged identification, the official at the KOSDAQ-listed Shinyang Engineering told Reuters on Tuesday. There are no child workers at Dongguan Shinyang now, said the official, who asked that he not be identified. The Chinese authorities have spoken to the children and they have been let go, the official said. Labor practices at Samsung Electronics suppliers have been under scrutiny since 2012, when the same activist group said seven children younger than 16 were working for one of the South Korean firm's China-based suppliers. Chinese law forbids hiring workers under 16. A Samsung spokeswoman had no immediate comment on the matter.  (Reporting by Se Young Lee; Editing by Ryan Woo) FREE AppDownload
