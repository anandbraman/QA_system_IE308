ReutersThe number is out and it's a miss. More to come. For March, Chinese Flash PMI has come out at 50.5. That's a whole point below expectations of 51.5. Generally, fears have been growing that Chinese growth is flagging again (something confirmed by last months' PMIs as well as Caterpillar's earnings today. This Flash PMI report will only confirm that. Here are some key graphs from the report, which you can download here. Markit Markit Markit
Just as people were starting to relax â€“ feeling that the warnings had been too alarmist â€“ the "sequester" news took a turn for the worse.Â Â Â Â  The consequences go beyond confirming that an already sluggish U.S. economy will now face a fiscal drag of Â½% of GDP this year (the first year of the sequester), adding to the 1% of GDP drag in the end-of-year "fiscal cliff" deal. They also suggest that we may never get a full handle on the negative effects of Congressâ€™s self-inflicted wound.Â Â Â Â  The sequester, or the automatic set of blunt spending cuts triggered by Congressional polarization and dysfunction, was all over the news in the first few weeks of the year. Warnings got louder as we got closer to the trigger date. Yet, in the immediate aftermath of the trigger, the vast majority of Americans felt no effects.Â Â Â Â  Many blamed the press for overhyping the issue. Some even pounced on the "false alarm" as confirmation that budget cuts, no matter how badly designed, could and should be pursued without hesitation. Just a few brave souls warned that it was only a matter of time until the adverse effects would become clearer.Â Â Â Â  I experienced a small reminder starting on Saturday evening. The airline I was flying the next morning sent me an automated e-mail warning me that "as a result of recent Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) sequestration budget cuts, your flight may experience delays."Â Â Â  On the plane the next day, the pilot informed us 20 minutes from our scheduled landing time that we had been placed on a "sequester hold." After we circled for quite a while, we were cleared to land.Â Â Â Â  On arrival at the terminal, I glanced at the screens. Despite good weather, most incoming and outgoing flights were quite delayed. Then I received an automated e-mail from another airline. This one warned me that "due to FAA furloughs, airport and flight delays are possible."Â Â Â Â  The next morning Libby Cantrill, a PIMCO colleague who follows the issue closely, confirmed that "sequester-related furloughs begin this week" across a number of federal agencies. Moreover, while problems were likely, she wrote that "they are not anticipated to catalyze members on the Hill to mitigate the sequester cuts for 2013."Â Â Â Â  Most analysts agree on the sequesterâ€™s measurable fiscal contraction. But what I realized as the subject was discussed during my meetings on the road is that the indirect effects, while consequential, may be largely invisible to most. So here are four of many:Â Â Â Â Â  Unfortunately, none of these effects â€“ and, more importantly, their joint impact â€“ is subject to precise quantification. As such, some may be tempted to dismiss them as inconsequential. That would be a mistake.Â Â Â Â  Any avoidable headwind to growth â€“ and this one is self-manufactured by Congress â€“ is a travesty for an economy that is already struggling to grow by 2% a year, has an unemployment rate of 7.6% (with some 40% composed of long-term joblessness), has seen its labor participation rate fall to a level last seen in 1979, and still needs to de-leverage safely over time.Â Â Â Â  It is not too late for Congress to course correct. And it can do so in two ways: Invert the fiscal policy logic, and supplement budgetary reforms with growth enhancers.Â Â Â Â  Today, Congress is combining blunt short-term contraction with pronounced longer-term uncertainty. This is a horrid mix; and it makes no economic sense. A more sensible approach would be to agree on medium-term fiscal reforms (for both revenues and spending) and lighten on immediate sequester-related cuts.Â Â Â Â  The inappropriate fiscal stance is not the only element holding back growth and jobs. Congress could also improve economic prospects by addressing structural impediments to the proper functioning of the labor market, credit, and infrastructure.Â Â Â Â  America is not Europe: The country does not face huge economic engineering problems in designing and implementing inclusive growth-enhancing policies. It faces political dysfunction that a set of well-intentioned politicians can (and need to) fix.Â Â Â Â  Unlike my Sunday flight that was forced into a circling pattern, there is no good reason to subject endogenous political renewal to an endless "hold."
Amid the gold crash, retail purchasers of gold are still buying heavily. From Reuters: A customer looks at bangles before purchasing them at a gold showroom in the southern Indian city of Kochi April 19, 2013. Gold rebounded above $1,400 an ounce on Friday as strong buying of coins and bars continued, primarily in Asia, but prices were still on course for a fourth week of losses after a brutal sell-off. Gold retailers struggled to cope this week as parents buying dowries, casual shoppers and tourists snapped up bars, coins, nuggets and jewellery as a slump in the price of the yellow metal released years of pent-up retail demand.

Here are a few excerpts from a Reuters article: Existing Home Sales Fall as Prices Rise Most Since 2005 U.S. home resales edged downward in March, a pause in the housing market recovery that has helped boost the economy ... Nationwide, the median price for a home resale rose to $184,300 in March, up 11.8 percent from a year earlier, the biggest increase since November 2005. The limited supply of available properties is pushing up home values. First, this isn't a "pause in the housing market recovery". The housing recovery is based on residential investment, and only the commission on existing home sales is included in residential investment (the main contributors are new home sales and home improvement).Â Â  A decline in the headline number for existing home sales due to fewer distressed sales, is a positive, not a negative! Second, the median price is a poor measureÂ of overall market prices since this reflects changes in the mix in addition to changes in prices (the repeat sales indexes are a better measure of price changes).Â  Note: Lawler used the median over the weekend to show that investors are buying at a higher price point - an appropriate use of the median price. The NAR reported total sales were up 10.3% from March 2012, but conventional sales are probably upÂ overÂ 20%Â fromÂ March 2012, and distressed sales down.Â  The NAR reported (from a survey): Distressed homes - foreclosures and short sales - accounted for 21 percent of March sales, down from 25 percent in February and 29 percent in March 2012. Although this survey isn't perfect, if total sales were up 10.3% fromÂ March 2012, and distressed sales declined from 29% of total sales to 21%, this suggests conventional sales were up sharply year-over-year - a good sign. However some of this increase is investor buying, although the NAR is reporting investors are buying about the same percentage as a year ago: Individual investors, who account for most cash sales, purchased 19 percent of homes in March, down from 22 percent in February; they were 21 percent in March 2012. Other data suggests investor buying has increased, see Housing: Some thoughts on Investor Buying, Inventory and recent Price Increases and from the WaPo: Wall Street betting billions on single-family homes in distressed markets  Of course inventory is the key number in the NAR report.Â  The NAR reported inventory increased to 1.93 million units in March,Â up from 1.90 million in February.Â Â Some of this increase was seasonal,Â and this is still a very low level of inventory.Â  AndÂ inventory is still down sharply year-over-year; down 16.8% fromÂ March 2012.Â  But this isÂ the smallest year-over-year decline since 2011.Â Â Â Â   Important: The NAR reports active listings, and although there is some variability across the country in what is considered active, most "contingent short sales" are not included. "Contingent short sales" are strange listings since the listings were frequently NEVER on the market (they were listed as contingent), and they hang around for a long time - they are probably more closely related to shadow inventory than active inventory. However when we compare inventory to 2005, we need to remember there were no "short sale contingent" listings in 2005. In the areas I track, the number of "short sale contingent" listings is also down sharply year-over-year. The following graph shows existing home sales Not Seasonally Adjusted (NSA). Calculated RiskClick on graph for larger image. Sales NSA inÂ March (red column) areÂ  above the sales for for 2008 through 2012, but belowÂ the bubble years of 2005 and 2006.Â   The bottom line is this was a solid report. Conventional sales have increased sharply, although some of this is investor buying. And inventory is low, but the year-over-year decline in inventory is decreasing.

Activist hedge fund ValueAct Capital took a $2 billion stake in Microsoft, its CEO Jeffery Ubben announced at an investment a conference in New York, today. He explained the investment by saying, "In three to five years, which is our time horizon, weâ€™ll stop talking about PC cycles and instead talk about Microsoft as the largest cloud-computing company in the world." For his sake, let's hope so. The PC business is imploding, so Microsoft's traditionally lucrative Windows business is flattening, and could start shrinking soon. Microsoft has two other businesses that are doing well â€” Servers and Tools and the Business Division, which is home to Office. Those businesses are strong enough to offset Windows, for now.Â  Microsoft's stock has been flat for the longest time. A lot of investors have been tempted by it, believing there is value to be unlocked. So far, they've been wrong. Microsoft is up 12% year to date, and rose 4% on today's news. It closed at $30.83. ValueAct describes itself as a fund "that combines intensive due diligence, a concentrated number of investments, and active, constructive involvement in the value creation at those investments." It has $10 billion in assets under management and it "concentrates on acquiring significant ownership stakes in a limited number of companies that it believes are fundamentally undervalued." Ubben says ValueAct will not do any campaigning to change Microsoft's strategy, according to Reuters. A Microsoft spokesperson gave us this comment on ValueAct: "Microsoftâ€™s Board of Directors and management team welcome the perspectives of shareholders. We are committed to enhancing value for all shareholders, and will continue to take actions that we believe will enable us to achieve this objective."
Lululemon actually benefitted from having to recall 17% of its yoga pants for being too sheer last month. The yoga retailer's shares are soaring on news that it would probably replenish all of its pants by early June, the Financial Post reported. This is much earlier than the company's previous estimate of July or August. And Lululemon's deft handling of the issue won over more than just Wall Street.Â  "We believe demand for Lululemon gear has not suffered from this transitory quality control issue, and likely benefited from the publicity,"Â Camilio Lyon at Canaccord GenuityÂ wrote in a note to clients today.Â  After Lululemon realized that some of its black luon pants were too sheer, it quickly issued a statement and recall. The company then offered refunds to anyone with affected pants.Â  Weeks later, the company said it had discovered and fixed a discrepancy in its testing system.Â Sheree Watson, the company's chief product officer, also stepped down.Â  The company's careful management of the crisis led to a quick recovery that has analysts saying the company is stronger than ever. Â Â  Still, the positive attention came at a price: it's estimated the debacle cost Lululemon $67 million. Here's a chart showing Lululemon's share price spiking in the month since the yoga pants crisis:Â  Yahoo! Finance
As @ParagonCap points out on Twitter, the S&amp;P 500 is now outpacing inflation expectations even more than it did at the market tops of either 2000 or 2007. The chart below shows that this divergence has been a couple years in the making at this point.Â However, in recent weeks, a lot of talk about disinflation and deflation has resurfaced. After taking the prize as one of the worst performing asset classes in the first quarter, the commodity complex has become completely unglued in April. At the same time, there has been a big rally in Treasuries as investors position for a slowdown in global growth. As the slide below explains, "Expectations of price increases (inflation) are a sign of potentially stronger demand growth and higher margins, which is a positive for stocks." Arguably, the latest developments on the inflation front are not positive for stocks. Twitter/@ParagonCapClick to enlarge
Gabby Cantero via FlickrA US based hedgie sent out a note to its clients over the weekend, saying they cut back on their use of Twitter. Add comment below if you got any. The note: 4/ Going off Twitter………………..Both me and Javad cut back out Twitter feeds by 95% last week. Is there any read-across from this? We have always seen “quantity” and not “quality” as our edge. Is there too much noise in the market now so that even noise traders like ourselves need to take a small step back? Or is it just Twitter that has peaked and become too mainstream? Don’t misread this believing that we trade based on Twitter, because we hardly ever do, but rather as a change of how we treat an information source.
YouTubeAs we begin to "discover" Japanese whisky, we immediately thirst for more, seeking out new brands and older expressions. We're the Captain Kirks of whisky drinkers, venturing into darkness. While the range of offerings in North America is small compared with other whisky categories, remember it wasn't long ago that the Irish whisky selections behind most bars were limited to the basics. More expressions and rare bottlings of Japanese whisky are expected to arrive this year and in the near future. In the meantime, here are three whiskies you absolutely ought to keep an eye out for. This single malt launched in the U.S. in 2011, and whisky geeksÂ who'd visited Japan were happy for its arrival on our shores, and were overjoyed to brag they'd tasted it first in Tokyo or Chiba City. It's made by Suntory (who also produce Yamazaki single malt and Hibiki blended whisky) at what's claimed to be the highest-elevated distillery in Japan. Fresh mountain water, dense forests and Japanese oak aging lend distinctive spice notes to the whisky. Lightly peated and light amber in color, Hakashu may remind you of lighter Islay expressions, like Caol Ila 12-year. On the nose, you'll get notes of smoke, vanilla, crisp apple and pear fruit. On the mouth, a sweet opening of candied citrus and roasted grain, with a long, lingering sweet smoke finish. If the 12-year whets your whistle for Japanese peated whiskies, you'll be pleased to know the higher-proofed (48% ABV) Hakashu Heavily Peated expression is scheduled to debut in the U.S. this fall. From the Nikka Whisky Company, and new to the U.S., this is a blend of malt whiskies from Nikka's two distilleries (Japanese whisky companies blend within their own properties, holding proprietary recipes and techniques close to their vests). Yoichi Distillery, built in 1934, produces classic, lightly peated Highland style whiskies, with notes of spice, caramel and dark chocolates with a hint of smoke. Whisky from Miyagikyo, Nikka's newest distillery in the mountains of Sendai, Honshu, offers up ripe fruit notes, and a lightly sweet palate with a silky mouthfeel. The pure malt blend (not a blended whisky, because there is no non-malted distillate involved) is a highly approachable, easy drinking spirit designed to introduce the novitiate to Japanese whiskies. Though it's only recently appeared on store shelves here, the International Spirits Challenge awarded it a gold medal in 2008, and it received Best Japanese Single Malt Whisky honors at the 2007 World Whiskies Awards. When you're ready for the next step up from Nikka, look for Yoichi Single Malt 15-Year ($130), also new to the U.S. If there's any Japanese whisky on the bar, it's likely Suntory's Yamazaki 12-year. Like Taketsuru, the 12-year is clean, approachable and easy drinking. A more dedicated bar will pour the 18-year. But come this October, the 25-year expression, new to the U.S., will be the holy grail of spirits from the Land of the Rising Sun. Suntory provided a taste of this sherry-finished, deep amber nectar to journalists last winter. It's rich with aromatics of raisin, rosemary, candied strawberry and apple, and ripe tomato aspic. On the mouth, the extra time spent in wood give classic rich notes of unsweetened chocolate, fresh earth, hazelnut and a just the slightest sweetness in its long dried apricot finish. Since a bottle will set you back more than a grand, either start saving now, or plan on swinging by your favorite whisky bar for a wee dram.
FA Insights is a daily newsletter fromÂ Business InsiderÂ that delivers the top news and commentary for financial advisors. The Housing Recovery Is OverÂ (David Rosenberg) Sales of existing homes unexpectedly fell 0.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.92 million in March, and Gluskin Sheff's David Rosenberg believes it's a sign the housing recovery has peaked.Â â€œMost of this recovery in the housing sector is probably behind us,â€ Rosenberg told Yahoo's Daily Ticker. Sales will â€œprobably level off for the next several monthsâ€ which is not â€œthe worst thing in the world.â€ Adjusted Vehicle Miles Driven Hits Another Post-Recession LowÂ (Doug Short) Travel on all roads and streets declined -1.4% (-3.1 billion vehicle miles) for February 2013 as compared with February 2012, Advisor Perspectives' Doug Short writes. If you adjust the figure for population, you get this chart: Doug Short "There are profound behavioral issues apart from gasoline prices that are influencing miles driven," he writes. "These would include the demographics of an aging population in which older people drive less, continuing high unemployment, and the ever-growing ability to work remote in the era of the Internet." Paper Gold Is Dead, Long Live Physical GoldÂ (Frank Holmes) There's been a huge sell-off in gold ETFs, U.S. Funds' Frank Holmes notes. But gold bugs aren't fleeing the scene. Rather, they're now piling into physical gold, he writes. "On one day alone, April 17, buyers scooped up a record 63,500 ounces from the U.S. Mint. This is equivalent to 2 tons of gold, 'more than the previous two months combined,' according to Zero Hedge. This is a drastic move compared to recent history." What's driving the shift? "Economics 101" he writes. "The coin supply is limited and the demand is high." Things Are Looking Ugly After First Week Of Earnings SeasonÂ (David Kostin) With 33% of the S&amp;P reporting, the first earnings season of 2013 is looking very bad indeed, according to Goldman's David Kostin. "Positive earnings surprises are tracking below average this quarter (36% vs. 47%). The percentage of firms missing earnings estimates by one standard deviation or more is also below the 40 quarter average (13% vs. 15%) implying more firms have reported results in- line with consensus expectations."Growth Is Back! (Brian Wesbury) First Trust's Brian Wesbury is holding to a 3.1% GDP tick for Q1 GDP on risingÂ consumer spending, business investment, and home building. "Three percent is nothing to sneer at. Monetary policy is loose, housing is rapidly recovering, Corporate America has high profits and strong balance sheets, and entrepreneurs are innovating at a breakneck pace."
For years, Apple would release low-ball earnings guidance which it would later demolish. Something changed last year, as you can see in this chart, and it's now merely beating, not demolishing its earnings guidance. For the nine quarters of March 2010 to March 2012, Apple beat its EPS guidance by 43.03% on average. In the last three quarters it beat EPS guidance by 12.75%. From March 2012 to March 2012, it beat its revenue guidance by 18.75%, for the last three quarters it beat by 4.54%. This has been wreaking havoc with the reactions to the company after it posts earnings results. Analysts eventually got wise to Apple's demolition, so they started jacking up their revenue and EPS estimates. When Apple suddenly, without warning, shifted gears it started whiffing on estimates relative to Wall Street's estimates. Fair, or unfair, Apple's stock, and overall performance was judged against Wall Street's estimates. In January, when Apple reported December guidance it tried to tell analysts it was being serious about its guidance this time. "In recent years our guidance reflected a conservative point estimate of results every quarter that we have reasonable confidence in achieving," said CFO Peter Oppenheimer, "Going forward we plan to provide a range of guidance that reflects our belief of what we’re likely to achieve." If Apple's EPS beats by the average established in the last three quarters, it will report $10.60 EPS, which will beat analysts estimates of $10.07. Using its last three quarters as a guide, revenue would be $43.91 billion, compared to analyst estimates of $42.49 billion. Investors would be happy with these results. Lately, there's been whispers of Apple missing its own guidance. If that were to happen, watch out. It will be messy.                                                                         	            					            Follow Tech Chart Of The Day and never miss an update!

JCPenney is a retailer on the brink of collapse.  "This is not a turn-around situation," George Bradt, managing director of executive consulting firm PrimeGenesis told us. "This is a 'turn off the lights' situation."  JCPenney's decline was accelerated when former CEO Ron Johnson took over in 2012. During his disastrous, 16-month reign, Johnson burned through the company's cash and drove away many of its loyal customers.  Even though Johnson was replaced by his predecessor Mike Ullman last week, many analysts feel the company's disturbing financials make it beyond repair.  We've compiled some facts to show the retailer's epic decline. 
McDonald's ever-widening menu could be hurting business because it overwhelms customers and increases wait times.  The McCafe line, which includes smoothies and specialty coffee beverages, is especially detrimental, argues Rick Munarriz, senior analyst at The Motley Fool.  McDonald's sales are down, which the retailer blames on the uncertain economy and poor customer service. The fast food chain even expanded its dollar menu and McCafe line to cope. It also created a new position in stores to ease customers through the check-out process.  But the company's solution for getting customers back in stores could be perpetuating the problem, Munarriz argues.  While items like those found in the McCafe line have been popular at Jamba Juice and Starbucks, those companies specialize in beverages.  "It's different at McDonald's where customers call it 'fast food' for a reason," Munarriz writes. "If customers are waiting longer and the cacophony of automated smoothie blenders and coffee orders that aren't made just right are hurting the dining experience, McDonald's may want to reconsider the upscale shot." Drive-thru customers wait an average of one whole minute longer at McDonald's than at competitor Wendy's, the Wall Street Journal reported.  But McDonald's is in a tricky place. Millennials largely prefer to eat at Subway, and so the restaurant is offering new menu items it believes will draw those customers in.  At the same time, McDonald's can't alienate its long-time customers by cutting popular menu items.  From McDonald's vantage point, smoothies and wraps are an easy way to get new people in restaurants.  But the chain will have to be careful not to let a bigger menu hurt customer service. 
Hasbro-parker-brothersThere are places in the world where even Wall Street investment banks must be careful to tread, at least that's what they're coming to realize. According to the Financial Times, banks are scaling down certain activities in high risk areas like the Middle East and Asia. This makes sense if you've been paying attention. Over the last year, bank after bank has been hit with sanctions for laundering money for unsavory actors in certain parts of the world. Perhaps the quote, “You f—ing Americans. Who are you to tell us, the rest of the world, that we’re not going to deal with Iranians?” rings a bell to you? It obviously does to Standard Chartered (they were sued by the U.S. government for money laundering last summer) and to other banks across Wall Street that have decided that they cannot trust their local partners in certain regions. From the FT: “We’re closing down certain relationships,” one top London-based banker said. Another added: “It’s about cost versus volume. Increasingly, the cost of policing a relationship can outweigh the commercial benefits.” Citigroup and JPMorgan are among the US banks to have retreated from a number of so-called correspondent banking relationships across several countries in the Middle East, Africa and Asia, aware that they cannot vouch for the integrity of local partners. HSBC, which paid out a $1.9 billion fine for money laundering charges that read like the plot of a James Bond film, will also be scaling back its activities. Head to the FT for more on this&gt;

With between $9 billion and $10 billion in debt, Zyuzin, who owns 65.49% of Mechelâ€™s shares and controls the company as chairman of its board, is now the steel and coal sectorâ€™s most heavily indebted proprietor. If not for a series of cash loans, bond purchases and guarantees from state-controlled banks â€“ Sberbank, VTB, Gazprombank, Eurasian Development Bank (EDB), and Transcreditbank â€“ he would be bankrupt. That is, Mechel, with a bottom-line loss last year of $1.7 billion, would be as bankrupt as the Estar group of steelmills, which Zyuzin took over in 2009, when Estarâ€™s proprietor Vadim Varshavsky went bankrupt. Varshavsky was consigned by state officials and the state banks to go belly up for debts of about $3 billion. Zyuzin has been preserved in his place for three times that debt. He has also been permitted to buy Varshavskyâ€™s old assets at a fraction of their value, using tolling schemes which may be considered asset stripping, a form of larceny, outside Russia â€” if their terms were known. In other words, Varshavskyâ€™s insolvent steelmills appear to be paying Zyuzin to take them over for Mechel. The more state debt Zyuzin racks up, the richer in assets he seems to grow. The company admits there may be a conflict of interest in this arrangement. Mechel, one of the very few Russian companies to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange and subject to the US regulator, the US Securities &amp; Exchange Commission (SEC), acknowledges in its latest SEC filing: â€œWe have also engaged and will likely continue to engage in transactions with related parties, including our controlling shareholder, that may present conflicts of interest, potentially resulting in the conclusion of transactions on less favorable terms than could be obtained in armâ€™s length transactions or transactions that may expose us to risks outside the ordinary course of businessâ€¦Thus, our controlling shareholder can take actions that you may not view as beneficial, and as a result, the value of the shares and ADSs could be materially adversely affected.â€ By keeping details of related-party, especially Zyuzinâ€™s transactions with Mechel from public report, Mechel shareholders are obliged to take this risk â€“ in the dark. Mechelâ€™s bankers are also invited not to look too carefully. But they reckon they donâ€™t have to, so long as the Kremlin guarantees to cover Zyuzinâ€™s mistakes and pay Mechelâ€™s obligations. In order to ward off default notices from its lenders, Mechel agreed with VTB earlier this month on a 5-year Rb40 billion ($1.3 billion) credit, the terms of which allow for an initial 15-month grace period in which nothing has to be repaid. In other words, the state is giving Mechel the cash to pay the debts its commercial lenders insist on receiving this year, and postponing the time Zyuzin must repay the state in return. This is difficult to explain to shareholders who watched as the price of their shares fell 6% this week, on release of Mechelâ€™s Form 20F annual report to the US Securities and Exchange commission (SEC). Since Mechel shares hit this yearâ€™s peak of $7.40 on January 7, they have fallen 49%. The market value lost has been $1.5 billion. At the moment, the New York stock market thinks Mechel is worth $1.57 billion. Itâ€™s obvious that with debts of almost six times that number, Mechel is worth much, much more to its banks than to its shareholders. But because most of the Mechel debt is held by state-controlled banks, and they control the repayment terms, the reality is that Mechel has been nationalized. Â  Bloomberg6-Month share price trajectory for Mechel According to the latest Mechel financial report released this week, the five state banks hold about 53% of Mechelâ€™s rouble debt equivalent to $5.4 billion; 50% of its dollar debt of $3.3 billion; and 17% of its Euro-denominated debt equivalent to $639 million. The proportion of Mechel debt held by the state-controlled banks is in fact higher, because the calculation should include the credits contributed by VTB subsidiaries in Austria, Germany and France which are participating lenders in the $2 billion syndicated loan of September 2010. Rouble bonds worth about $2.4 billion also benefit from state bank underwriting and repayment guarantees. Varshavskyâ€™s tale was told here. Whatever has persuaded state officials and state bankers that Zyuzin is more honest and competent than Varshavsky is, however, not an issue that is permitted to be examined in public, no matter how much in state money is committed to keep Zyuzin in full control of Mechel. Zyuzin, with approval from the federal government in Moscow, regional governors, and state banks, has loaned large sums of money to Estar steelmills for raw materials like coal, iron-ore, ferroalloys and scrap, along with semi-finished steel, all produced by Mechel, the book cost of which has been exaggerated in tolling agreements. In practice, Zyuzin has been slowly taking over the Varshavsky assets by creating debt beyond the capacity of the mills to pay. As the small print of Mechelâ€™s Form 20F, the SECâ€™s required annual report filing, explained for 2011: â€œAccording the loan agreement, in the event that the loan is not repaid at maturity (September 30, 2012), the Group is entitled to enforce the pledge over the pledged related metallurgical plants assets and thereby take control of these assets subject to approval from the Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service.â€ In November 2011, when the receivables or debts owed by the Varshavsky mills to Zyuzin came to $1.06 billion, Mechel loaned $944.5 million, and then extended the maturity date for repayment (aka takeover) to June of 2013. Varshavskyâ€™s assets have so far paid off $213.4 million, so the default amount is about $731.1 million. Another example of the way Zyuzin adds assets to the nationalized Mechel, but keeps secret how the transactions are funded, and who pays, is the purchase last December of Vanino port, on the Sea of Japan. After years of controversy over the privatization of the stateâ€™s control stake in the port, and competition from oligarch groups including Vladimir Lisinâ€™s United Cargo Logistics Holding and Oleg Deripaskaâ€™s EN+, Mechel emerged the victor. Mechelâ€™s report to the SEC this week says: â€œOn December 7, 2012, the Group won an auction to acquire 74,195 common shares (73.33% of the total common shares or 55% of the total shares) of Vanino Sea Trade Port OAO (â€œPort Vaninoâ€), the largest seaport in Khabarovsk Krai, located in the Tatar Strait in Russia, for 15.5 billion Russian rubles ($501,444 [000] as of the auction date).â€ But Mechel, which didnâ€™t have $501.4 million in cash and wasnâ€™t allowed by its banks to borrow the money, managed to pay for the port acquisition by selling it to somebody else. Again, according to the Form 20F disclosure, â€œon January 9, 2013, the shares of Port Vanino were transferred and the Group made a cash payment of 15.5 billion Russian rubles. On the same date, 72,780 of the acquired shares were sold to several Russian and foreign investors (â€œInvestorsâ€).â€ This took care of the state stake in the port. The minority shareholder in Vanino, Deripaska, was then bought out, according to the following scheme. â€œOn January 28, 2013, the Group acquired additional 21,892 common shares (21.64% of the total common shares or 16.23% of the total shares) and 16,039 preferred shares (47.56% of the total preferred shares or 11.89% of the total shares) of Port Vanino from a minority shareholder. The aggregate consideration for the preferred shares was 275 million Russian rubles ($9,152[000]) and was fully paid. The maximum aggregate consideration for the common shares is 4.77 billion Russian rubles ($158,817[000]) which is to be paid by October 2013. The Group has an option to sell and to require one of the Investors to buy 22,707 common shares and 16,039 preferred shares for the maximum aggregate price of $174,611[000]. The option can be exercised by October 2013.â€ End result, for the record: â€œThe purchases resulted in 23,307 common shares and 16,039 preferred shares being held by the Group. These shares represent 29.2% of the total share capital of Port Vanino, or 23.04% of the total common shares, which enables the Group to have significant influence over the operations of the investee. This acquisition will be accounted for using the equity method of accounting and will be included within long-term investments in related parties as of January 28, 2013.â€ End result, in practice: Mechel has operational control of Vanino, and formal control of 29% of its capital, 23% of its shares. But it hasnâ€™t paid the $669.4 million price tag. Instead it paid a handful of cash, and arranged with â€œRussian and foreign investorsâ€ to pay the rest. If it turns out that these investors are Zyuzin and his Cyprus companies, whose assets are Mechelâ€™s, and they are in turn pledged to secure state loans, then the scheme is a subterfuge, and the port privatization was an elaborate fake. If it turns out that some of the foreign investors are South Korean or Japanese coal buyers and traders, whose interest in the port is in getting more coal cargoes at a discounted transportation tariff and perhaps at a discount to the coal price benchmark, then Mechelâ€™s future revenues are being charged for the asset. Either way, Mechel is in effect borrowing to buy the asset with trade receivables from related parties. Such a scheme looks like a loan covenant breaker for the banks, and a charge against future net income from which shareholders have been hoping to be paid dividends. In short, a secret worth Zyuzinâ€™s while to keep to himself. Mechelâ€™s disclosure to the SEC is this: â€œIn addition to the information disclosed with respect to this acquisition, ASC 805 requires the Group to disclose the amounts to be recognized at the acquisition date for assets acquired and liabilities assumed. It is impracticable to disclose this information because the Group has not completed the purchase price allocation as of the date when the financial statements were available to be issued.â€ When the deal for Vanino was first announced, Barry Ehrlich of Alfa Bank, a leading steel analyst in Moscow, acknowledged that having the port under control for its expanded coal exports was a good thing for Mechel, but the extra debt would be a bad thing. â€œOverall payment for Vanino may total RUB21.1bn (~$650m). As of the end of 2Q12, Mechel had $8.7bn of net debt on the balance sheet and net debt to EBITDA ratio of 4.4x. Leverage is a major concern for the company, and we believe the news is NEGATIVE for Mechel if the acquisition would result in cash outflow from the company and further inflate its stretched balance sheet.â€ â€œThe news suggests that Mechel already has certain arrangements to sell the 25% stake in Mechel Mining and that it may finance the Vanino acquisition from that cash flow. The news may also suggest that one of the conditions for the MM [Mechel Mining] stake acquisition was acquisition of the port in order to secure shipping capacity to facilitate Elga coal exports to Asian markets. The buyer of the mining stake may provide long-term financing for the Vanino acquisition.â€ In retrospect, it can be seen that the Mechel Mining sale has yet to materialize â€“ not to the Koreans, Japanese or Chinese. Another Russian state entity, Vnesheconombank (VEB), may turn out to substitute for the foreigners and by another loan to Mechel the government will nationalize the asset, rather than let it go. So has Vanino port been sold to anyone in particular? Who are these Russian and foreign investors? Privately, Mechel management has been explaining to its bankers the benefits of the Vanino deal, and the strategic relationship between expanding the flow of coal for export from the Sakha republic (Yakutia) mines, adding to the capacity of the state railroad to carry the coal to port, and enlarging Vanino itself for the extra trade. According to one bank analyst, â€œthe management has been highlighting a number of tangible benefits for Mechel of â€˜sort ofâ€™ owning Vanino, such as the volume guarantee (there is a high competition from coal exporters to access Far East ports); plus Vanino is the end destination of BAM [railroad], and in this capacity acts as a regulator of the cargo traffic, which makes the entire eastern bit of this railroad more flexible to Mechelâ€™s traffic needs; plus Mechel will be saving on port loading charges. Even if Mechel may have agreed on some discount for its coal as part of the Vanino deal, this has to be considered in the context of the benefits they are gaining. Last, but not the least, by buying Vanino Mechel is also saving on its own capex which would go otherwise to expand the capacity of Posiet [port, already owned by Mechel]. Vanino Bay is still better than Posiet as it allows to load larger capacity ships. Expansion of Posiet would have been a must (until they had Vanino) in order to ship all the new coal coming from Elga mine. [Without the Vanino acquisition] to allow expansion of [coalmine] output and target export markets, $2 billion plus in investments in the Sakha mines would be a waste.â€ This sounds reasonable. But has Zyuzin told the banks by whom exactly the deal is being paid for? The five state bank lenders to Mechel â€“ Sberbank, VTB, Gazprombank, Transcredit Bank, and Eurasia Development Bank â€“ were asked the question. They refuse to answer. The following banks, listed in Mechel Form 20F filings as well as in announcements of Mechel loan syndicates, were also asked the question: Unicredit, Raffeisen, ING, BNP Paribas, HSBC, Nordea, SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale, Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse, Royal Bank of Scotland and Natixis. Nordea was the only one to respond. It claims it is no longer in a Mechel loan syndicate. Analysts at the banks acknowledge there is a blanket of secrecy around Zyuzinâ€™s dealings, which isnâ€™t worth their jobs to probe. According to one, â€œin the market there are quite different rumours of who the buyers are, starting from a number of Russian names, from [Gennady] Timchenko [for Gunvorâ€™s expanding coal operations] and ending with some Asian companies. And it is possible more than one person, but several. And it is said that it can be Zyuzin himself. But there is no consensus. Mechel itself keeps it in great secrecy; there is apparently no leak.â€ Another bank source claims the banks have not been let in on the secret. â€œIn one of the presentations which they [Mechel] showed to banks from whom they take credits, there is no such information. That is, it was written that they are buying a port in the consortium, that they do not require any funding, it does not affect either the covenants â€” nothing else. But just who exactly [is paying] was not written in the presentation. It may be that [Mechel] opened it to the banks in a private conversation. But it was not in an open presentation for the bankers-lenders. Even there they have not disclosed it.â€ A Russian expert on ports says, also off the record: â€œMy sources say that Zyuzin took his money out of the thrift box. That is, it is not the money of Mechel, it is money of Zyuzinâ€™s by almost 100%.â€ A well-informed Moscow bank source says he is confident the deal was done by â€œrelated party receivables.â€ He concedes too that there is genuine fear among bank analysts and newspaper reporters to open up what this means. He suspects that Mechel has written down receivables from related parties, meaning Zyuzin companies, and the corresponding amount has then been paid by the Zyuzin companies offshore to acquire the Vanino port shares. In short, Mechel is lending (or giving) Zyuzin $669.4 million. â€œThe [accounting report] dotsâ€, claims this source, â€œconnect to Vaninoâ€. Mechel wasnâ€™t asked to disclose what it is keeping secret about the transaction. Instead, it was asked to explain the companyâ€™s reasons for not disclosing to the New York stock market and to shareholders the identities of the Vanino port investors, Russian and foreign; and to clarify Mechelâ€™s purpose in the withholding and how it should be understood as compliance with normal corporate transparency standards. The company promised to work on the request and reply. It hasnâ€™t done so.
Through Friday, 104 companies (33% of the market cap) of the S&amp;P 500 have announced there Q1 2013 financial results. While it's still very early into the earnings announcement season, the early tally is not very encouraging. The analysts at Goldman Sachs have compared the earnings announcement surprises to the surprises seen in the last 40 quarters (10 years). "Positive earnings surprises are tracking below average this quarter (36% vs. 47%)," said Goldman's David Kostin. "The percentage of firms missing earnings estimates by one standard deviation or more is also below the 40 quarter average (13% vs. 15%) implying more firms have reported results in- line with consensus expectations." As you can see, there have only been two quarters in the past 40 quarters with a few percentage of companies beating estimates. Goldman Sachs

@UniverseCosmosWall Street investment banks stand to lose $17 billion in revenue from fixed income, currencies, and commodities trading by 2016 due to new regulation, Bloomberg reports. This is bad news made even worse by the fact that Wall Street earnings showed that these asset classes are the sick men on The Street already. Banks lost revenue in sales and trading across the board, and currencies, commodities, and fixed income lead that race to the bottom. Goldman came out losing the least in S&amp;T, having ended the quarter down only 7%. Morgan Stanley's S&amp;T revenue, the biggest loser, was down a whopping 40%. Basically, what Bloomberg is reporting is that it's going to get worse. So this is dark, very dark. From Bloomberg: European securities firms will bear most of the erosion as a tax on financial transactions cuts sales and trading volumes, Deutsche Bank analysts including Matt Spick, wrote in a note to clients today. The next â€œwaveâ€ of regulation on over-the- counter derivatives and clearing may spur smaller competitors to exit the businesses, they said. There is a small silver lining here for NYC, which is that Deutsche goes on to say the blow to European investment banks will likely have clients heading to the other side of the pond. So there's that.
Barron'sBarron's is doubling down (quadruplingÂ down, really) on its bullish Dow call with a cover story this week that screams, "Dow 16,000!" There remains widespread belief that as soon as a bullish Dow call starts blasting from newsstands, it is time to sell. Analyst John Hussman is already out with a piece warning it's time to hit the ejection button: Rule oâ€™ Thumb: When the cover of a major financial magazine features a cartoon of a bull leaping through the air on a pogo stick, itâ€™s probably about time to cash in the chips. This kind of backlash against mainstream bull calls stretches back at least a couple decades.Â  And it's usually wrong.Â  As Josh Brown has noted: "the knee-jerk reflexive contrarianism on the web each weekend is just as unhelpful as blindly believing in whatever the editors choose to sell us that week from the newsstand." We went through the history of the Dow, from the 1960s to today, to prove why this is complete hogwash. (Many thanks to Barry RitholtzÂ andÂ Josh Brown for digging up some of the older magazine covers in here...)
Flickr/Dimitry BBy 2020 the world's wealthy will have moved most of their private banking activity from Switzerland to Singapore, according to research group WealthInsight. And of course, they'll need people to manage that money. The country couldn't be more ready. It's becoming a hub for Asia's rich. In fact, Boston Consulting Group recently namedÂ Singapore the country with the world's densest population of millionaires -- 17 percent of all households, to be exact. To serve that population, Singapore has built an infrastructure of high end shopping, hotels, and nightlife. So if you've got the cash, there's plenty of room for you to play (and work) too.
Flickr/byJoeLodgeApple is down a whopping 44% from it's all-time closing high, which was $702.10 on September 19, 2012. That's an enormous $291.42 billion worth of paper losses for Apple shareholders. "To put that number in perspective, the amount that Apple has lost from 09/19/12 through Friday’s close is more than the total value of the smallest 71 companies in the S&amp;P 500 index," said Oppenheimer's John Stoltzfus. "Put another way, the value lost over this seven-month period exceeds Friday’s closing market capitalization of the third-largest S&amp;P index member, Google Inc., by more than $25 billion!" Those are big numbers.

AP Photo/The Lowell Sun & Robin YoungOne of the suspects in the Boston Marathon bombings held a gun to a carjacking victim and told him he had been responsible for the bombings, FBI Special Agent Daniel Genck detailed in a criminal complaint filed against 19-year-old Dzhokhar TsarnaevÂ Monday. According to the complaint, one of the suspects â€” the complaint does not specify whether it was Dzhokhar or his 26-year-old brother, Tamerlan â€” entered the vehicle and pointed a gun at the victim. THe New York Times reportedÂ that Tamerlan is believed to have been the initial carjacker. "Did you hear about the Boston explosion?" the carjacker asked his victim. "I did that." According to the complaint, the carjacker then removed a magazine from the gun, showed the victim that he had a bullet in it, and re-inserted the magazine. "I am serious," he said. The carjacker forced his victim to drive to another location to pick up a second man â€” the other suspect. The man with the gun demanded $45 from the victim, as well as his ATM card and password. The carjacking victim escaped when the two men got out of the car at a convenience store in Cambridge, Mass., according to the complaint. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was charged on Monday withÂ one count of using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction and one count of malicious destruction of property with an explosive device. Tsarnaev could face the death penalty. Here's the relevant part of the complaint: Justice Department This post has been updated.
Robert Libetti/ Business InsiderIf this is what Apple is aiming for, Apple is screwed.As Apple's growth has slowed and its stock has crashed, die-hard Apple fans have started defending the company based on the quality of its products. Apple isn't selling a cheaper iPhone, Apple fans explain, because Apple doesn't want to sell one. Apple doesn't like selling "cheap plastic crap." Apple doesn't want to make "phones for the masses." Apple just makes products for people who like (and are willing to pay for) the finer things in life--like BMW. The trouble with this argument is that it ignores two things: On this latter point, recall the difference between Apple's pricing strategy in the current Apple era and its pricing strategy in the 1990s. In the 1990s, Apple made computers that were arguably superior to Windows-based IBM PCs, but they were also priced higher. Apple fans took pride in this: Shelling out for a Mac meant that you were a person of means and taste, not someone ready to settle for the plebeian tools of the proletariat. Alas, it turned out that the number of these well-heeled aesthete Mac buyers was too small to make Apple anything but a niche player. And as the decade progressed, Apple was increasingly marginalized until, in the late 1990s, it nearly went bankrupt. To Apple's great credit, however, it learned from this mistake. This time around, when Apple introduced the iPhone and iPad, it made sure that it was not only the quality leader but also the price leader. The subsidized price of the iPhone, for example, quickly settled at $199, and the phone remained cheaper than all high-end alternatives until Apple's competitors finally realized they had no choice but to match the $199 price point. And after that, the iPhone's quality edge, combined with its price parity, allowed it to continue to be the world's best-selling phone. When Apple launched the iPad, meanwhile, it mimicked this pricing strategy. For a couple of years, the iPad was not only the best tablet on the market, it was also the cheapest. For the average consumer, it made no sense to even consider buying a non-Apple tablet: The product would not only be worse--you would also have to pay more for it. In other words, in the early years of both the iPhone and iPad, Apple was not positioned as the company that sold "premium-products-at-a-premium-price." It was positioned as the company that sold "premium-products-at-the-same-or-lower-prices." That's excellent positioning! And it is the positioning that made Apple the world's most profitable and valuable company. To use the car analogy, Apple was selling BMWs for the price of Fords. And you don't have to be George Soros to see that BMW would sell a heck of a lot more cars--and make a heck of a lot more money--if it could sell BMWs for the price of Fords. But BMW can't do that. And now, Apple can't (or won't) anymore, either. In the past 18 months, Apple's market positioning has changed in a subtle but profound way. This is not the company's "fault," per se--the strength and aggressiveness of Apple's competitors had a lot to do with it--but it is a reality that Apple now has to deal with. First, at the high end of the phone market, Apple's competitors have caught up with the iPhone. Samsung, HTC, Google, and even BlackBerry are all making phones that are basically on a par with the iPhone 5 (and some people consider some of them to be superior). Also, developed markets like the U.S. and Europe have matured, and the rapid smartphone growth has shifted to emerging markets. In developed markets, which often have carrier subsidies, a $400-$600 price point for a phone is workable. In emerging markets, without subsidies, this price point is simply out of reach of most consumers.  In the tablet market, meanwhile, Apple was radically undercut on price by Google, Amazon, and other small-tablet manufacturers. When Apple finally responded with a small tablet of its own--the iPad Mini--Apple chose to sell it at a price point that was considerably higher than Amazon's Kindle and Google's Nexus 7. Apple also made compromises in the Mini that some Apple devotees found disappointing, namely using a lower-resolution screen. The upshot is that, except in emerging markets, Apple is NOT BMW.  Apple did not get to where it is today by selling the best product at the highest price.  Apple got to where it is today by selling the best product at the same or lower prices.  In other words, it got to where it is today by offering mass-market consumers excellent products at an affordable and highly competitive price. Unfortunately, now, Apple's products are no longer obviously superior to common alternatives. And some of them--namely, the iPad Mini--are now priced higher than common alternatives. In short, the only markets in which Apple is positioned like "BMW" are emerging markets. And there are not many people in emerging markets who can afford to buy BMWs, which is why Apple is getting clobbered. So what will happen if Apple maintains its current market positioning? If Apple remains "BMW" in emerging markets, selling premium products at premium prices, it will continue to get clobbered in terms of market share. Because the mobile game is a platform game, this matters: The less market share Apple has, the less relevant and popular it will be as a development platform. The more Apple will run the risk of being a niche "also-ran" like it was in the early 1990s. And Apple will also continue to miss out on the explosive growth that is catapulting the growth of Samsung and other mobile manufacturers in these markets. In developed markets, meanwhile, if Apple stays at price- and quality- parity with other leading vendors, one of two things will happen: Either the ~$199 subsidized price point for top-of-the-line phones will remain the same, and Apple will continue to take a strong share and continue to pile up cash on its balance sheet without growing much. OR, more likely, Someone who makes a smartphone that is basically as good as the iPhone--or at least "good enough"--will radically undercut the iPhone on price. That's what tends to happen in consumer technology markets. And Apple's massive profit margin leaves it highly exposed to this kind of competition. If a high-end smartphone market radically undercuts the iPhone on price, Apple will either be forced to sit and watch as it loses sales to the cheaper competitor... or match the competitor's price.

Bank of AmericaDifferent markets sending different signals. That's the gist of BofA Merrill Lynch rates guru David Woo's latest report – titled "The impossible trinity: A tale of three cities" – which begins like this (emphasis added): The commodity market is saying global growth is slowing. The US equity market is saying US consumers are still going strong. The FX and European sovereign markets seem to believe Mrs. Watanabe is about to embark on a global shopping spree. We think it is unlikely that these markets will all turn out to be right. Something will have to give and a major re-alignment of the markets, the odds of which are rising, will probably not be either smooth or benign, in our view. "It is probably an understatement to say that lately it has become more difficult than usual to read markets," writes Woo. "To the extent that these themes reflect market expectations of reality, there seems to be three different versions of reality right now." With regard to the first version of reality – that which is evidenced by the commodity market, which has sold off hard in recent weeks and months – Woo says "the body of evidence suggesting that the global economy is slowing is growing almost every day," making the idea of a global slowdown "difficult to refute." Here, Woo points to China and its recent release of weaker-than-expected first quarter economic data. In the past, he says, investors usually took weak data as a sign that Beijing would "unleash more stimulus" on the Chinese economy in response. "This time around," he writes, "things may turn out differently as the strong momentum behind recent home price appreciation may hold back policymakers from easing quickly and with decisiveness." The chart below shows the home price obstacle facing Chinese leaders weighing any additional stimulus at this stage in the game. BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research The second version of reality is that advanced by the rising U.S. stock market. Not only have U.S. stocks outperformed outperformed other major equity markets around the world this year, but within the U.S. market, consumer staples and consumer discretionary stocks have been leading the way higher. Woo points out that the first quarter of this year was the first time since 2000 that both consumer sectors led a rising stock market. However, the story on the ground is not as encouraging. Home price appreciation has stalled a bit, consumer confidence is falling, and, as Woo highlights in his report, "with the household saving rate having fallen to just 2.6% in February – the lowest level since December 2007 – household consumption could be more vulnerable than usual to any sudden confidence shock." That confidence shock could set in with the effects of the sequester, which entails around $50 billion in fiscal tightening measures over the next six months. "If we were to assume that this will primarily take the form of reduced wages/salaries of government employees and contractors and that most of the hit will occur in Q2," writes Woo, "this could result in a very dramatic shock to household income." BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research Finally, there is the Japan story. Japan recently decided to go big with quantitative easing in a "shock-and-awe" campaign designed to weaken the yen and push Japanese investors out of Japanese government bonds and into riskier, higher-yielding assets both at home and around the world. Woo says this argument makes sense, but is probably way early. Woo explains that Japan's capital account is key to understanding why this is the case: By definition, Japan’s ability to export capital depends on one thing only: the size of its current account surplus. Over the past two years, as the Japanese current account surplus dwindled, so has the pace of Japanese capital outflows slowed. In other words, for Japanese money to flood global markets like it did in 2005-7, Japan’s deteriorating trade balance will have to first turn around. In our view, this is unlikely to happen quickly. The two main factors behind the dramatic deterioration of Japan’s trade balance since 2010 were a surge in Japan’s energy imports and the slowdown in the EU and China. The recent depreciation of the Japanese yen will have very limited impact on either. Indeed, Japan’s trade deficit could worsen in the short-run as the result of the price inelastic nature of energy demand. In short, Woo thinks markets are underpricing the risks that (1) that Beijing won't be able to counteract a weakening economy with more stimulus due to rising home prices; (2) the U.S. housing recovery won't be able to offset the blow to the consumer brought by the sequester; and (3) that Japanese money doesn't leave Japan anytime soon. As for just exactly what he means by "major re-alignment of the markets," Woo told Business Insider that "in the event of a synchronized global slowdown, US consumer discretionary, EM currencies, and European peripheral debt could all suffer decline."
APU.S. officials have brought charges against 19-year-old Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the Justice Department said Monday.Â  In a criminal complaint, Tsarnaev was chargedÂ with one count of using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction and one count of malicious destruction of property with an explosive device. Tsarnaev could face the death penalty. Tsarnaev is suspecting of carrying out last week's Boston Marathon bombings with his brother, 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who died last Friday after a gunfight with police. Meanwhile, the White House said Monday that it would not treat Dzhokhar Tsarnaev as an "enemy combatant."Â White House press secretary Jay Carney said that Tsarnaev would be prosecuted through the normal criminal justice system. "This is absolutely the right way to go and the appropriate way to go," Carney said. The FBI said Monday that Tsarnaev remains in "serious" condition at Beth Israel Deaconess. Here is the full complaint: Criminal Complaint - Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, Boston 
AP Photo/Federal Bureau of InvestigationWhite House press secretary Jay Carney said on Monday that the Obama administration will not treat Boston bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev as an "enemy combatant," bucking calls from Republican members of Congress. Carney said he will be prosecuted through the normal criminal justice system. "This is absolutely the right way to go and the appropriate way to go," Carney said. Tsarnaev was charged Monday in his hospital bed, according to Bloomberg.  Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) had been leading a charge to treat the 19-year-old Tsarnaev — who was captured by police on Friday in Watertown, Mass. — as an enemy combatant. Graham was joined by U.S. Sens. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.), as well as Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.). The GOP lawmakers said that Tsarnaev met the definition of an enemy combatant, which would prevent him from invoking rights to remain silent and to an attorney. It would allow federal interrogators to question Tsarnaev without reading him his Miranda rights as a U.S. citizen under a "public safety" exception. "He’s a potential enemy combatant. He has ties with overseas terrorists. He’s clearly a radical Islamist. I would hold him under that theory," Graham said Monday on "Fox &amp; Friends." "This idea that the only way we can question him about national security matters is to go through his lawyer, turns [it] over to the terrorist and their lawyer controlling information to protect us all. That’s crazy. That is absolutely crazy. This man should be held and questioned under the law of war."
As we pointed out in March, the kinetic potential across the hard commodity-scape appeared to be of the 2008 variety; i.e. watch for disorderly and cascading declines.Â Following the commodity rout this past week - headlined by severe declines in gold and silver, the deflationary tea leaves we had also been highlightingÂ were brought to the forefront by an audible chorus. We suppose that for many folks -Â seeing is believing. Â Although for the moment we are still sitting on the disinflationary side of the continuum, we wonder how much longer until deflations formal third act appearance is made - and what the Fed's policy responses will be. As much as we recognize the considerable effects of the Fed's structural work in the markets, we have always weighed their most powerful tool to be a motivational capacity to inspire market expectations. Considering this recovery has predominantly been waged on the shoulders and guidelines of the Fed - the psychological vulnerability to disappointment is greater than ever. With that said, we are rooting for our monetary handlers to continue fighting the good fight, but fear the inherent limitations of bridling mother nature.Â _________________Market AnthropologyDeflation may be back.Deflation - a word as synonymous with the Great Depression as it is with Ben Bernanke and monetary policy. And although the Chairman's academic vision-quest had focused on its many perils and shades, it has long been viewed as the Kaiser Soze of the financial system. Inflation, for all its pernicious ways, does come with a well-worn reference manual of troubleshooting examples, that should it find malicious traction - has enough policy measures the Fed could realistically apply in the current monetary environment. Deflation, however, has remained lurking in the shadows of the recovery just long enough, that should the collective world economy turn down with enough harmonic velocity, could make a third act appearance - steal the show, as well as the accompanying legacy reviews.Â _________________Â A few Cliff Notes:_________________Â Â - Act I -Â Deflation's first act took stage after the Nasdaq bubble burst in 2000. It wasn't until the November 6th 2002 Fed meeting that an official cautionary mention of deflation was brought forth. Transcripts revealed that the Fed Chairman at the time - Alan Greenspan, remarked, "It's a pretty scary prospect and one that we certainly want to avoid." He also expressed concern about the country falling into a "Deflationary hole." As consequence, the Fed continued to lower the federal funds rate at the November meeting and cut one more time the next year pushing the rate to 1 percentÂ on June 25, 2003Â - a 45 year low. It was also directly subsequent to the November 2002 meeting, that on November 21st of that year, Chairman Bernanke - then a regional Fed governor, delivered his infamous,"Deflation: Making Sure "It" Doesn't Happen HereÂ speech. Needless to say, participants were jockeyed to the risk troughs and the deflationary tide receded after the historically low interest rate environment turned down an over-valued US dollar and rekindled economic growth, inflation expectations and wealth perceptions. While domestically centered around the US housing market, a broad and collective economic expansion arose from the now emerging economies tied to a fresh commodity cycle. Â Â - Act II -In the fall of 2008, deflation's second act arose from the collapse of the housing and commodity sectors and the smolder of the financial crisis that led the global economy to a grinding halt.Â Now coordinated with the other major central banks, the FedÂ reacted to the second coming of deflation by aggressively following the monetary policy easing playbook and byÂ administering a radical bolus injection of quantitative measures in November 2008. By December 16th, the Fed arrived at ZIRP - thus, lowering the fed funds rate to 0%. In an attempt to stabilize markets as well as ignite inflation expectations following the sharp equity market declines into March, the Fed more than doubled its quantitative purchases on March 18th, 2009. Led by the Fed, the net a(e)ffects of these extraordinary measures turned back another deflationary tide - as well as a strengthening US dollar. It also succeeded towards restoring faith in a now matured commodity cycle and the emerging and recently emerged economies tied to it. Success was noted in the second half of 2009 when inflation expectations improved and were on the rise.Â - Intermission -Â By the second quarter of 2010, the Fed had completed its purchases of Treasury and MBS securities tied to the initial salvos of QE. As consequence, risk appetites and inflation expectations had been receding in the equity and commodity markets. The CRB and CCI indexes had crested in January with the SPX topping at the end of April 2010. Conversely, the US dollar had exhibited considerable strength since the end of 2009. To rejuvenate risk appetites within the system, the Fed hinted - then introduced QE2 in the second half of that year. This inspired a broad based rally in the commodity and equity markets and once again turned back the US dollar from undermining the net benefits of QE and inflation expectations within the system. Although core PCE hit a record low in the December 2010 data series, QE2 initially succeeded at turning inflation expectations back up through 2011.As we have repeatedly described in our notes since 2011, we often view silver as an emotional proxy of the commodity sector. As such, once it began its parabolic ascent sparked by QE2, we strongly felt that the commodity cycle was nearing exhaustion and the US dollar had finished carving out a secular low - regardless of QE. Although many market participants were still quite concerned at the prospects of runaway inflation and a broken dollar tied to extraordinary monetary measures - we felt those expectations were unfounded and dangerous to those long the commodities trade. Â  "And although it is quite true that our current fiat monetary system is inflationary over the long run, the degree of distortions that are currently being reflected in both the precious metals market, the commodities market and the currency markets - likely do not reflect a representable correlation to inflation today, but more of a serious bubble in the commodities sector."-Â Y2K=QE2 4/18/2011 Shortly thereafter, silver and the commodity sector crested and the US dollar began to strengthen. Headline PCE topped a few months later with core PCE turning down in the beginning of 2012.Â Fast forward to where the markets currently float downstream of an additional round of stimulus with QE3 - and our expectations last September for further weakness in the commodity sector, as well as the US dollar's stubborn strength in neutralizing inflation expectations have been realized: Â  "While I am impressed with the Chairman's conviction and fortitude in persisting down a path he clearly defined over a decade ago, I find myself with increased skepticism towards many investors perception of its perennial influence - that closely correlates with my comparative work with trends, analogs and historical market data. What many in the financial punditry will describe as an obvious cause and effect - is more than a little bit nuanced when you step back and gauge the broader environments the Chairman has created monetary policy in.Â During the prior salvos of QE in 2008, 2009 and 2010 - the commodity cycle was still cresting, thus, emerging global growth (BRICs) remained elastic; China was growing at a double digit pace - and the US dollar was still searching for a long-term low.Â  Today, my work has suggested that the long-term commodity cycle has crested, growth across both the developed and emerging world economies is turning down, China is slowing rapidly - and the US dollar has found a secular low.Â I like to remind myself that it's much easier to rekindle economic growth across the globe, when all that is required is a large shovel, boat and a frothy marketplace. Although commodity inflation has provided the US consumer a painful transition in the pocketbook over the past decade, we likely do not fully appreciate how beneficial that same knife has smoothed the impact of our own financial stumbles - in a world more than ever financially dependent upon the health of the majority.Â  I suggest we now minimize the academic conventions and transmission mechanisms of QE, and the purported impacts of the intervention playbook penned by the Fed over the past decade. Why? Because now that the central banks have once again responded to the drumbeat of their constituencies, the marketplace will now carry out psychological exams in the face of their monetary proctors. The final results, once the initial anxiety and euphoria abate - will likely uphold the long-standing market tradition of breaking conventional wisdom against the grain.Â  The commodity markets,Â that have rallied so fervently this summerÂ in anticipation of another bolus by the Fed, the ECB and the PBC - will need to overcome the notion of "pushing on a string", that was not nearly as applicable in 2010 - as it is today. It is my belief, based on my comparative work with theÂ USÂ dollar,Â theÂ Australian dollarÂ and theÂ CRB, that the commodity rally ignited this summer will fail - and fail as prominently as the equity markets faired to the aggressive monetary policy regimes enacted by the Fed at the end of 2007. Back then, market psychology quickly pivoted from - "Don't fight the fed!", to "the Fed is pushing on a string!"Â - almost overnight."Â -Â A Lucid Confusion 9/18/2012Â  A common denominator throughout Act's I &amp; II of the Fed's lengthy battle with deflation is a capacity to weaken the dollar and rejuvenate inflation expectations. From our perspective and as we await Act III - that ship has sailed. Market Anthropology
Flickr/Oakley OriginalsYes, Wall Street is still hurting, but there are still a few jobs that will make you a ton of cash, and eFinancialCareers has the latest numbers. The most money is in alternative asset management â€” hedge funds, private equity etc. Those employees with experience levels up to 10 years make a 24% salary premium compared to your peers. For bulge bracket banks (the JP Morgan's, Goldman Sachs' etc.), that premium is up to 20%, but the catch there is that you have to survive what has become a seemingly endless beat down of layoffs. And you have to be working in the right sectors at bulge bracket banks. According to eFinancialCareers, that means getting into commercial banking, accounting and finance, or capital markets, where jobs have exploded 217%, 112%, and 74% respectively in the last year. On the other hand, jobs in derivatives, foreign exchange and money markets, and commodities are down 69%, 63%, and 62% respectively. So keep all this in mind while you're making your next career move. Â 
APNearly two months after the across-the-board cuts known as the sequester began to kick in, Americans are finally beginning to notice â€” in the form of major flight delays that started on Monday.Â  Air traffic controllers started going on furlough Sunday because of the cuts, which led to delays â€” and complaints of the delays â€” on Sunday night and Monday.Â  According to the Associated Press, the FAA said Sunday thatÂ flights from Philadelphia and Orlando, Fla., into John F. Kennedy, LaGuardia, and Westchester County airports were delayed due to staffing issues. There were also delays of up to three hours at Los Angeles International Airport. The FAA's website also reported significant delays at LaGuardia, Newark, Washington Dulles International, and Charlotte International airports Monday morning â€” though most major airports across the country aren't yet feeling the hit. FAA officials have said they will have to furlough all 47,000 employees at the agency, including nearly 15,000 air traffic controllers. Each employee will be furloughed for one day of work every other week. The FAA has said that planes will be forced to take off and land less frequently because of the furloughs. People are starting to noticeÂ â€” and so are both sides of the political aisle. The Democratic National Committee is blasting out stories detailing the cuts. The Republican National Committee, meanwhile, is out with a campaign on Twitter that deems the delays #ObamaFlightDelays, urging constituents to call the White House if they're experiencing delays: RNC
Steve Kovach/Business InsiderSecurities regulators want to overturn bans on monitoring employees' social media accounts, the Wall Street Journal's Jean Eaglesham and Michael Rothfeld report. That would put them in line with the very entities they regulate, as the banking industry also opposes the measures. At least four states have adopted privacy laws restricting employers from looking at what workers are Tweeting and posting to Facebook. Â  But last year, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) challenged California's law on grounds that it prevents brokerages from policing investment advice, Eaglesham and Rothfeld write. Now FINRA is joining the chorus to allow access.Â From WSJ: Securities regulators worry that the raft of new laws aimed at protecting employees' privacy puts investors at risk. They say the fast spread of financial advice on social networks such as Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc. could create new channels for Ponzi schemes and other frauds, and that fighting those frauds will be harder if state lawmakers snarl efforts by companies to monitor what employees are pitching to investors. In 2009, a finance exec paid a $10,000 fine in connection with hyping a stock on Twitter, WSJ notes.Â  Read the full story on WSJ.com &gt;
TwitterWe recently had the chance to chat with Ethan Nadelmann, founder and executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance, an organization that has been at the forefront of the country'sÂ marijuana legalization and decriminalization efforts.Â  Here are the most important things he told us about the movement to reform the country's marijuana laws:Â  Marijuana legalization activists are not making the same mistakes they did in the 1970s, when they assumed victory was certain but support dropped off unexpectedly: "Part of whatâ€™s important is to remember the lessons of the past. Marijuana is not going to legalize itself. Our opposition is not going to take its current defeats laying down [...] People believe that a generational shift makes marijuana legalization inevitable [just like] back in the late 1970s. Â Notice that support dropped by the late 1980s. It would be a mistake for the people who advocate for legalizing marijuana to be overconfident, letâ€™s not take success for granted, letâ€™s keep being strategic about how we proceed." Right now ballot initiatives are the most important strategy. The first victories are always through ballot initiatives, then subsequent victories can come through legislatures: "As with medical marijuana, the first seven states to legalize medical marijuana [...] Â were Â done through the initiative process. Then the next ten states since that time, half were more or less through the initiative process and half were through the legislative process." California and Oregon are probably next, then start watching the polls: "So it means California in 2016, it means Oregon probably 2016 and maybe sooner. The way to look at this is to look at two things.  First, what were the first states to legalize medical marijuana, because that will give you a good idea of whatâ€™s next with full legalization. Those are generally the western states plus Maine.  The second thing to look at is where you see majority support for legalizing marijuana. Keep in mind, you never run a ballot initiative to educate the public. You only run a ballot initiative where a majority agrees with the objective and where the legislature or the governor arenâ€™t willing to take public opinion into public law." The success of the movement depends on their success in keeping pot away from kids: "We need to be attentive issue of young people using marijuana Â â€” the issue of young people waking and baking and smoking daily is something that nobody wants. I Thatâ€™s why at Drug Policy Alliance we have a major emphasis on young people, the parents, the schools and marijuana use. If you look, we put out these documents called "Safety First."Â We allied with the California [Parent Teacher Association] around this issue so itâ€™s important that the advocacy for ending marijuana prohibition be combined with a responsible approach Â toward marijuana use and especially towards issues of irresponsible use of marijuana by young people." If tying safety to advocacy sounds a lot like what the NRA does, that's not accidental. "You see the alcohol industry doing the same thing. Obviously for us, our role models are the most successful advocacy organizations regardless of their issue. It may be Planned Parenthood, it may be the NRA, it may be Human Rights Watch. They all have success in influencing public opinion and legislation.Â  Whatâ€™s important is not the politics of these organizations but their success. Â We're using their methodology even though we have dramatically fewer resources." Finally, the similar trajectory between marijuana legalization and the gay marriage movement should be very encouraging for advocates of drug policy reform.Â  "With the marijuana reform movement, we really feel like our big brother is the gay rights movement. The issues are so similar. First of all, if you look at the public opinion polls Â Look at the Gallup poll on gay marriage legalization and look at the public opinion poll for marijuana legalization. They line up almost exactly between 2006 and 2011."Â 
BloombergIn recent weeks, economists Carmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff have taken a lot of heat for a computational error in their paper relating economic growth with debt-to-GDP ratios. However, Goldman Sachs economist Jim O'Neill reiterates that the spreadsheet error isn't even the biggest problem with the paper. Rather, it was the suggestion that you could simply compare varying economies just using a handful of leverage ratios. From O'Neill's latest Viewpoints note (emphasis added): According to a number of media reports, central bankers at the interim IMF meetings in Washington, D.C. admitted that they don’t really know what is going on in developed economies, nor the consequences of their current policies. While, no doubt, many observers will be worried about these rather frank admissions, in my view they are rather welcome. From my own education in economics, it has been clear for a long time that it is a social science, and certainly not close to a pure science. So, of course, economists shouldn’t know what is going on. They can have a degree of confidence, but one might argue that one of the reasons why the 2008-09 crisis happened could be that too many people were too confident about their knowledge of economic relationships. Anyhow, to add to the mix, there has been particular attention on the research by Kenneth Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart, published in 2010, which has been highly influential in many circles in the past three years. According to media reports, a group at the University of Massachusetts reproduced the Rogoff and Reinhart research and, using the same data set, reached very different conclusions. Rogoff and Reinhart appeared to show that countries with a public debt-to-GDP ratio of 90% or more showed persistently lower growth than other countries, and inferred that to boost growth, debt reduction was a major necessity. Perhaps somewhat more than they might have recommended, some countries and observers have used this research to justify fiscal austerity. Following the attention the Massachusetts paper has received, Rogoff and Reinhart have apparently admitted their results were not quite as strong on re-analysis of the dataset. Coming soon after an admission by the IMF that they had underestimated the negative cyclical effects of fiscal tightening, this is seen as a victory for Keynesian-biased thinkers who have obviously articulated that growth would be restrained by fiscal tightening, irrespective of potential supply- side benefits of lower public debt. Linked to my earlier comments about economics being merely a social science, it would seem reasonably obvious that grouping countries together in terms of their debt levels and concluding that the economic consequences are the same is quite a tricky path to tread. Even to apply such arguments about balance of payments current accounts, which to some degree are more of an accounting identifying and therefore less subjective, is tricky, but countries with high debt levels usually share very little else with each other. As a result, the remedy for the debt reduction and, more importantly, economic development and growth are probably very different. I doubt that the right economic policy for Greece, for example, could be applied to Japan. What is almost definitely the case as a result of this attention is the fact that accelerated fiscal tightening is unlikely in countries where real GDP growth continues to struggle.

Breaking into the hedge-fund world is harder than before IF SETTING up a hedge fund were easy, more people would do it: bar inheritance or winning the lottery, there are few swifter paths to immense riches. Sadly for aspiring plutocrats, it is getting ever harder to launch a fund. Swaggering financiers once joked that launching with less than $1 billion of outside money to invest was hardly worth their time. Debuts that splashy are now notable only for their scarcity. A new fund typically opens with $50m-100m in assets under management. Even so, and despite buoyant stockmarkets, the number of launches is declining (see chart). Punier funds make for a less attractive business model. A $50m pile might once have been enough to sustain a small firm. Creaming off 2% of assets and 20% of profits--the standard hedge-fund fee formula--could generate around $2m a year given decent performance. No longer. Declining fees and low industry-wide returns have halved that amount. Expenses have risen, too. Thanks to the Bernie Madoff swindle, investors want to see sturdier back-offices staffed by compliance types. Gone are the days when two traders with a Bloomberg terminal and some banking contacts could brand themselves as a hedge fund and attract outside money, says Kent Clark of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, the bankâ€™s investment arm. Paying for all this box-ticking requires more like $100m in assets. The industryâ€™s investor base has also changed, which makes it hard for those firms that do get off the ground to soar. Hedge funds used to get most of their money from rich people; nowadays, institutions such as pension funds are the dominant investors. They are often more risk-averse, preferring to invest bigger sums in fewer, large managers with a longer record. Although over half of hedge funds manage less than $100m, they represent only 1.4% of the industryâ€™s $2 trillion or so in assets, according to Hedge Fund Research, a data provider. The ranks of potential hedge-fund managers have also thinned. Post-crisis rules banning banks from wagering their own money prompted many of their star traders to leave and set up their own funds. That exodus is pretty much over; many of these new funds have already shut up shop after delivering underwhelming performance. The most favoured potential managers of new hedge funds these days are the key lieutenants at existing large funds, says Dominic Freemantle of Morgan Stanley. Enough new funds are still launching to raise a question: why would any investor prefer managers at an established firm to set up their own shop? Data are patchy but suggest that start-ups do deliver better results. This may be down to newcomers being smaller and nimbler, or hungrier for the returns that will earn them mega-bucks. And many of the most sought-after funds are closed to new money, points out Ted Seides of ProtÃ©gÃ© Partners, a hedge-fund investor. Backing their most promising offshoots is the next best thing. Indeed, a handful of specialist investors are looking to back new hedge funds in the same way that venture capitalists back start-ups. Blackstone, Goldman Sachs and others have pots of money dedicated to "seeding" new managers, entrusting them with $20m-100m of funds to invest in return for a share of revenue, typically 20%. Such seed funds had $5 billion to invest last year, estimates Acceleration Capital Group, an advisory firm. But even they have struggled to deploy money profitably. Many suggest that bright traders make lousy entrepreneurs. "Often they have a long track record but havenâ€™t run their own business before," says Lisa Fridman of Paamco, a fund investor. Running a successful hedge fund is still fabulously lucrative, however. The top 25 managers globally last year took home a combined $14 billion in pay and profits, according to Institutional Investorâ€™s Alpha --and that was the worst year since 2008. Nine made over $500m. Even if the going is tougher, aspiring managers will keep trying their luck. Click here to subscribe to The Economist 
REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach Germany's new, anti-euro political party – Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) – would get the 5% minimum share of the national vote required to enter the German Bundestag if September's federal elections were held today, according to a new INSA Institute poll conducted for Bild, Germany's most widely circulated daily newspaper. This is a big milestone for the party, which was only officially founded on Sunday, April 14, and hasn't even fully registered for the September elections yet. The poll shows how much appeal the anti-euro stance has in Germany right now. (Last Monday's INSA Institute poll only gave AfD 3% of the total vote.) In a report on the rise of AfD published Friday, Deutsche Bank's Co-Chief European Economist Gilles Moec discussed the remarkable success the nascent political party has found so far. Moec provides figures from a few other polls that show the extent to which AfD is able to tap into the anti-euro sentiment that exists in Germany (emphasis added): According to a recent poll by Infratest Dimap (mandated by German weekly Welt am Sonntag) dated April 7, 24% of the respondents indicated that they could imagine voting for the AfD in the federal elections. 7% of respondents answered "Yes, for sure". 17% of respondents answered "Yes, perhaps". (CDU/CSU voters: 19%; SPD: 21%; Greens: 14%; Left Party: 29%; FDP: n/a; undecided/non-voters: 31%) In another poll by Forschungsgruppe Wahlen (mandated by ZDF Politbarometer) dated April 12, 17% of respondents stated they would vote for a party at the federal elections that favoured an EMU exit. (CDU/CSU voters: 11%; SPD: 18%; Greens: 8%; Left Party: 20%; FDP: n/a; undecided/non-voters: 26%). These voter potential analyses do not provide any hard indications of the real election outcome. For example, the Pirates party occasionally scored well above 30% in similar polls when they reached their zenith of public attention last year, but would likely score considerably lower in real voter polls now. Still, these figures provide an initial indication of the potential for swing voters. Interestingly, despite the right-wing connotation of the party, there is also a considerable amount of voters of the SPD and the Left that indicated they could imagine switching sides. Given the evident interest in an anti-euro choice among the German electorate, it shouldn't be too much of a surprise that AfD has already garnered significant media attention. Moec outlines three reasons for this: Moreover, Moec says, AfD is cleaning up on social media networks. "So far, the AfD has already gathered 24,000 ‘friends’ [on Facebook] while more than 18,000 users are involved in forum discussions," Moec writes. "(By comparison: CDU: 36,100, 806 involved in discussions. SPD: 36,850, 5,460. FDP: 20,300, 1,702. Linke: 20,750, 1291)." In short, the party is off to a good start. However, according to Moec, "From now on, it will likely be mostly exogenous factors that influence the AfD’s success in federal elections." In other words, should the euro crisis begin to re-escalate prior to the election – with Angela Merkel unable to handle it in a way that "[squeezes] the AfD off the public's radar screen," the party could really translate this early momentum into a significant impact on the electoral outcome in September.
WikipediaAEI's Jim Pethokoukis observes the fallout fromÂ Reinhart and Rogoff's Excel error appears to have officially jumped from the digital to the real. Stanford economist John Taylor reportsÂ that the G20 appears to be abandoning specific fiscal and monetary goals: A participant in last Fridayâ€™s G20 meetings told me that the error was a factor in the decision to omit specific deficit or debt-to-GDP targets in the G20 communique. The error refers to Reinhart and Rogoff's leaving out data that would have shown high debt-to-GDP levels actually don't produce that great an impact on growth. Taylor argues the error does not affect the over all lesson of Reinhart and Rogoff â€” that large debt loads are bad, but still, this is hard evidence that the austerity movement is crumbling. Earlier we talked about how Bill Gross was a critic of austerity now, and so are others in Europe. While the influence of Reinhart and Rogoff on the initial push for austerity may be overrated, the destruction of this study is clearly having an impact.
These developments could explain some of the recent performance of the US stock market. The DAX peaked at a new cyclical high on March 14. It is down 7.4% since then. Global investors may be switching out of European stocks and into American ones, especially blue-chip defensive names that are viewed as safe havens. When the new governor of the BoJ announced on Thursday, April 4 that he intends to double the balance sheet of Japanâ€™s central bank, bond yields plunged around the world.

Ball and BuckIn an effort to get Boston back on track, men's clothing shop Ball and Buck is donating 10% of all sales made online and in its Newbury Street store today to victims of the Boston Marathon bombing. They're calling it, 'The Patriot Day Fund.' "As a brick and mortar retailer located just around the corner from the first blast, it was important for us to do whatever we could to help those affected by this senseless act," said store founder Mark Bollman. "The Pats’ Day Fund was created to help other businesses like Ball and Buck make a meaningful contribution to those affected by this tragedy." Ball and Buck is known for being 100% made in America, and is named after the musket loading method George Washington recommended his troops use during the American Revolution. We just thought you should know. Check out Ball and Buck's site here.
Flickr / ND StruplerIn case you needed a reminder of how unfathomably lame our government is, look no further than what is now happening with our air-traffic control system. Thanks to the unnecessary "sequester" spending cuts that our government supported, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is having to send air-traffic-control workers home without pay. These "furloughs," which resulted from the sudden need of the FAA to slash spending by 10%, kicked in on Sunday. And, according to Reuters, they are already causing airport delays. New York airports JFK and LaGuardia, for example, reported delays of more than an hour. So did Philadelphia. If these furloughs continue through September, as they must unless our government finally wakes up and governs, they will save $200 million of the $637 million that the FAA has to cut from its $16 billion budget. And they will waste millions and millions of hours that citizens and businesses could productively spend doing something other than waiting around airports for our government to get its act together. Yes, there are philosophical differences about the ideal role and scale of government in a civilized society. Americans generally believe that government should be smaller, and do less, than the governments in most civilized societies (our government spending, and our tax rates, are low relative to other first-world countries). But aside from a few fringe extremists who think we should go back to being a lawless frontier nation, it's hard to imagine that are too many Americans who don't think we should have a fully functioning air traffic control system. But our government apparently does. I don't know about you, but I don't want to waste an extra hour every time I am forced to travel by plane. And I don't want our employees to waste countless hours every time they're forced to travel by plane. And I don't want all Americans to waste countless hours every time they travel by plane... all so that we can cut a tiny bit of spending that we don't even need to cut. If our government wants to talk seriously about fixing our long-term healthcare spending problem--the only budget problem that is really a problem--then, great. It's high time the government did that. But enough with the nickel-and-dime slashing of basic services. We need a fully functioning air-traffic control system. And it's time we got ours back.

When I was 18 I went to college and went about $50,000 in debt. Why would an 18 year old do that to themselves? I majored in computer science. 8 years later when I got a real job they made me take remedial programming classes after I crashed everyone’s email and trashed the network. When I was 21 I went to graduate school and got thrown out less than two years later. They told me when I was “mature” enough I could come back. I don’t know. Maybe one day they will let me back. When I was 22 – 27 I wrote a bunch of novels and dozens of short stories. All of them were rejected by 40 publishers and probably most of my friends hated them but were embarrassed to tell me. When I was 24 I was the 8th employee at Fore Systems. I made a game, “Missile Command” to demo their product. Then I quit by walking out one day (hitchhiking) and never returning. A year later they went public and employees 1-50 became multi-millionaires. Between the ages of 20 and 30, 10 women broke up with me. I don’t think I broke up with any of them. One of those ten is Facebook friends with me. Two are dead. When I was 30 I sold my first company to a company that eventually went bankrupt. When I was 30-31 I spent 365 days straight playing poker without spending more time on my family, on health, on creativity, on positive things. When I was 32, at the height of the dot-com boom, I started a venture capital fund. I invested millions of dollars in dot-com companies and lost it all. From peak to low in 2000-2002, $15mm cash to $0 and losing my house. I had to start from less than scratch (I owed taxes after hitting $0). When I was 32 I started a company which raised about $100 million. Lost it. When I was 34 I hung up the phone on my dad in an argument and never returned his calls. Six months later he had a stroke and died. A week before that he had emailed me to say hello but I didn’t return the email. I’m sorry, Dad. Nobody in my extended family speaks to me anymore. When I was 36 I started a fund of hedge funds. I turned over every rock on Wall Street to find something good to invest in. There was was nothing good to invest in. All of Wall Street is a scam. Capitalism is good but Wall Street is a scam. When I was 38 I shut down the fund of hedge funds. 10 of the funds I invested in were probably scams. There was nothing to invest in. When I was 39 I bought a house at the top of the housing market. Then I got a divorce. Then the stock market crashed. Lost a house, a family, and all my money. Again. When I was 39 I started a company I still believe in but I was so depressed I let it just disappear. When I was 39 I started yet another hedge fund. This one lasted for two months before I shut it down. When I was 40 I started a company I didn’t believe in and wasted $40,000 trying to build it. Someone said to me the other day, “it’s good to make lemonade out of lemons”. I hate lemonade. When I was 18 I didn’t know what the outcomes of things were. I still don’t. I can’t say “bad” or “good” on any one event. Who knows? My early 40s got a little worse. Then a lot worse. But then they got better. A lot better. A whole lot better. I’m glad everything happened. I’m very grateful. I wouldn’t change a thing.
Wall Street investment firms are feverishly grabbing single-family homes, the Washington Post reports. Wall Street's been buzzing about this trade for a while. Institutional investors are taking advantage of cheap inventory, combined with our low interest rate environment, to make double digit returns from renting or re-selling homes. As a result, markets in some places are recovering rapidly â€” Phoenix, for example, has seen single-family home prices rise 23% in the past year. There are questions as to whether this situation is good for the average consumer. If prices rise while jobless rates remain high, it could take longer for the "end-user" of a property to raise the cash to afford a home. From WaPo: â€œClearly the investors are moving markets in some places,â€ said Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research and author of a popular housing blog. â€œIn some markets at the bottom end, you are looking at 30 or 40 percent gains year to year. That is frightening to me. At some point the music stops. The investors if they get hurt, that is their problem. But invariably a lot of other people will get caught up in that.â€ How big is this? Here are a few numbers to give you an idea of how dominant institutional investors are in this space. Lets see how this all shakes out.
via Street EasyBillionaire hedge funder Steve Cohen, whose SAC Capital has come under scrutiny lately, has been snapping up real estate left and right. He recently purchased a $60 million Hamptons home. Â He also bought 145 Perry Street in the West Village, the New York Post reported citing property records.Â  He's not only buying. He also put his Upper East Side duplex penthouse onÂ the market for $115 million. Now the latest chatter, according to the Post, is that Cohen snapped up an apartment in The Abingdon located onÂ 320 West 12th Street byÂ Abingdon Square Park in the West Village.Â  We called The Abingdon up to confirm this. Â They had no comment.Â  Street Easy's website shows that there are nine listing currently in contract at the ten-home apartment building. There are two penthouses â€” East Penthouse and West Penthouse, according to the Abingdon's website. Â There are two "mansions" â€” East Mansion and West Mansion.Â  The lowest priced unit in the building is a three-bedroomÂ 3,263 square-foot apartment for $8.75 million and the most expensive is a three-bedroom 5,602 square-foot penthouse for $25 million. Â There is also a 9,600 square-foot West Mansion costs $25 million, according to Street Easy.Â  The most recent sale at The Abingdon was for $13.2 million, the site shows. That was the 5,951 square-foot East Mansion.Â  The Abingdon is a newly converted condominium building. The building was originally a home for working women and later a nursing home with 200 beds for its residents, according to the New York Times.Â  It looks super nice, according to promotional photos posted onÂ Street Easy.

Jurassic Park screenshotOver the past six months, Wall Street has gone from thinking that Apple can do no wrong to thinking that there's no way Apple will ever again do anything right. As a result, the stock has collapsed from a high of $702 to a recent low of $390 last week. And Wall Street is now bracing for what most people expect will be a terrible quarterly earnings report and outlook on Tuesday. Apple's results in the December quarter disappointed many analysts, and the company's outlook for the first quarter was also meh. But after a steady flow of news reports suggesting that first-quarter sales have not gone well, as well as Apple's failure to release any new products this year, many on Wall Street think that Apple will miss even its low guidance for the quarter. Worse, many expect that Apple will slash the outlook for the June quarter to far below what Wall Street is currently expecting. In other words, Tuesday's earnings report is expected to be a disaster. And that's one reason the stock has tanked over the last several weeks: No one wants to be the sucker left holding the bag. But the silver lining is that, for the first time in forever, expectations for Apple's quarter are very low. And if the company really does drastically reduce its outlook for the rest of the year, expectations going forward are likely to remain that way. And that will give Apple the opportunity to do something that it has not done in a year--surprise Wall Street on the upside. In other words, provided the news and outlook isn't completely horrible, this quarter could (emphasis on could) mark an inflection point. The other good news for Apple's clobbered shareholders is that, in the high $300s, the stock appears to be cheap. At $390, Apple is trading at 9-times trailing earnings, a low valuation multiple for a high-quality company that still seems to have good growth prospects ahead of it. (Not this year, if Wall Street's estimates are accurate, but in future years). Apple's profit margin will almost certainly drop over the next couple of years, as the company faces stiff competition from Samsung, Google, and other hardware manufacturers. But even if Apple's profitability drops, the company should still generate enough cash to make the stock's valuation look attractive. To be sure, if Apple is in the early phase of a long-term decline, then today's stock price is not, in fact, "cheap." The stocks of companies like BlackBerry, Dell, and Hewlett-Packard looked very cheap in the early stages of their collapse...but then the companies' businesses collapsed, too. If Apple's product quality deteriorates, or the company clings too stubbornly to its current price points, Apple will be at risk of staging another complete collapse, following in the footsteps of the near-death experience it had in the 1990s. But, for now, Apple is still an excellent company with excellent products that has missed a couple of steps. If the company sets the bar low in Tuesday's earnings call, and then releases some exciting new products in the next few months, the stock may be nearing an inflection point. Disclosure: Last week, when Apple's stock crashed to a new low of $390, I bought some. I think stock-picking is an idiotic strategy for individual investors, and I almost never do it. But, sometimes, for fun, I put my money where my mouth is. You can read about the logic behind my Apple purchase here.
Nick Bastian Tempe, AZMarch existing home sales data are out. Sales unexpectedly fell 0.6% last month to 4.92 million units at a seasonally adjusted annualized rate. February sales data were revised to 4.95 million units from 4.98 million units. Economists predicted sales would rise 0.4% to 5.00 million. Below is the full text from the release: WASHINGTON (April 22, 2013) - Existing-home sales eased in March from inventory constraints, which continued to pressure home prices, according to the National Association of RealtorsÂ®. TotalÂ existing-homeÂ sales1, which are completed transactions that include single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums and co-ops, declined 0.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.92 million in March from a downwardly revised 4.95 million in February, but remain 10.3 percent higher than the 4.46 million-unit pace in March 2012. Sales have been above year-ago levels for 21 consecutive months, while prices show 13 consecutive months of year-over-year price increases. Lawrence YunÂ , NAR chief economist, said there is more demand than supply in the current market. "Buyer traffic is 25 percent above a year ago when we were already seeing notable gains in shopping activity," he said. "In the same timeframe housing inventories have trended much lower, which is continuing to pressure home prices. The good news is home construction is rising and low mortgage rates are continuing to keep affordability conditions at historically favorable levels. The bad news is that underwriting standards remain excessively tight, while renters are getting squeezed by higher rents." Total housing inventory at the end of March increased 1.6 percent to 1.93 million existing homes available for sale, which represents a 4.7-month supplyÂ 2Â at the current sales pace, up from 4.6 months in February.Â Listed inventory remains 16.8 percent below a year ago when there was a 6.2-month supply. "The inventory improvement last month results from a seasonal gain, but conditions continue to broadly favor sellers. We need a housing supply of over 6 months to have a generally balanced market between home buyers and sellers, but it's unlikely we'll get there without greater increases in housing construction," Yun said. The national median existing-home price3Â for all housing types was $184,300 in March, which is 11.8 percent higher than March 2012. The March increase is the strongest since November 2005 when it rose 12.9 percent from a year earlier, and the last time there were 13 consecutive months of year-over-year price increases was from May 2005 to May 2006. Distressed homes4Â - foreclosures and short sales - accounted for 21 percent of March sales, down from 25 percent in February and 29 percent in March 2012. Thirteen percent of March sales were foreclosures, and 8 percent were short sales. Foreclosures sold for an average discount of 15 percent below market value in March, while short sales were discounted 13 percent. According to Freddie Mac, theÂ national average commitment rateÂ for a 30-year, conventional, fixed-rate mortgage increased to 3.57 percent in March from 3.53 percent in February; it was 3.95 percent in March 2012. NAR PresidentÂ Gary Thomas, broker-owner of Evergreen Realty in Villa Park, Calif., said homes are selling much faster. "The typical home sold in March was on the market for one month less than it took to sell a year ago," he said. "Multiple bidding is becoming more common, and more homes are selling above the asking price, so buyers need to move quickly and follow their RealtorÂ®'s advice for contingencies when making contract offers." The median time on market for all homes was 62 days in March, down from 74 days in February and is 32 percent below 91 days in March 2012. Short sales were on the market for a median of 81 days, while foreclosures typically sold in 46 days and non-distressed homes took 66 days. Thirty-seven percent of all homes sold in March were on the market for less than a month. First-time buyers accounted for 30 percent of purchases in March, unchanged from February; they were 33 percent in March 2012. All-cash sales were at 30 percent of transactions in March, down from 32 percent in February; they were 32 percent in March 2012. Individual investors, who account for most cash sales, purchased 19 percent of homes in March, down from 22 percent in February; they were 21 percent in March 2012. Single-family home sales slipped 0.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.32 million in March from 4.33 million in February, but are 9.1 percent above the 3.96 million-unit level in March 2012. The median existing single-family home price was $185,100 in March, up 12.1 percent from a year ago. Existing condominium and co-op sales fell 3.2 percent to an annualized rate of 600,000 units in March from 620,000 in February, but are 20.0 percent higher than the 500,000-unit pace a year ago. The median existing condo price was $178,900 in March, which is 10.4 percent above March 2012. Regionally, existing-home sales in the Northeast were unchanged at an annual rate of 630,000 in March and are 6.8 percent above March 2012. The median price in the Northeast was $237,000, up 3.0 percent from a year ago. Existing-home sales in the Midwest rose 1.8 percent in March to a pace of 1.16 million and are 14.9 percent above a year ago. The median price in the Midwest was $141,800, up 7.8 percent from March 2012. In the South, existing-home sales slipped 1.5 percent to an annual level of 1.95 million in March but are 12.7 percent above March 2012. The median price in the South was $161,700, which is 10.4 percent above a year ago. Existing-home sales in the West declined 1.7 percent to a pace of 1.18 million in March but are 4.4 percent above a year ago. With notably constrained inventory conditions, the median price in the West rose to $258,100, up 26.1 percent from March 2012.

Local MLS data is the most accurate source of sales and price information in specific areas, although there may be differences in reporting methodology. 1Â Existing-home sales, which include single-family, townhomes, condominiums and co-ops, are based on transaction closings from Multiple Listing Services. Changes in sales trends outside of MLSs are not captured in the monthly series. NAR rebenchmarks home sales periodically using other sources to assess overall home sales trends, including sales not reported by MLSs. Existing-home sales, based on closings, differ from the U.S. Census Bureau's series on new single-family home sales, which are based on contracts or the acceptance of a deposit. Because of these differences, it is not uncommon for each series to move in different directions in the same month. In addition, existing-home sales, which account for more than 90 percent of total home sales, are based on a much larger data sample - about 40 percent of multiple listing service data each month - and typically are not subject to large prior-month revisions. The annual rate for a particular month represents what the total number of actual sales for a year would be if the relative pace for that month were maintained for 12 consecutive months. Seasonally adjusted annual rates are used in reporting monthly data to factor out seasonal variations in resale activity. For example, home sales volume is normally higher in the summer than in the winter, primarily because of differences in the weather and family buying patterns. However, seasonal factors cannot compensate for abnormal weather patterns. Single-family data collection began monthly in 1968, while condo data collection began quarterly in 1981; the series were combined in 1999 when monthly collection of condo data began. Prior to this period, single-family homes accounted for more than nine out of 10 purchases. Historic comparisons for total home sales prior to 1999 are based on monthly single-family sales, combined with the corresponding quarterly sales rate for condos. 2Â Total inventory and month's supply data are available back through 1999, while single-family inventory and month's supply are available back to 1982 (prior to 1999, single-family sales accounted for more than 90 percent of transactions and condos were measured only on a quarterly basis). 3Â The median price is where half sold for more and half sold for less; medians are more typical of market conditions than average prices, which are skewed higher by a relatively small share of upper-end transactions. The only valid comparisons for median prices are with the same period a year earlier due to a seasonality in buying patterns. Month-to-month comparisons do not compensate for seasonal changes, especially for the timing of family buying patterns. Changes in the composition of sales can distort median price data. Year-ago median and mean prices sometimes are revised in an automated process if additional data is received. The national median condo/co-op price often is higher than the median single-family home price because condos are concentrated in higher-cost housing markets. However, in a given area, single-family homes typically sell for more than condos as seen in NAR's quarterly metro area price reports. 4Â Distressed sales (foreclosures and short sales), days on market, first-time buyers, all-cash transactions and investors are from a monthly survey for the NAR'sÂ RealtorsÂ®Â Confidence Index, posted at Realtor.org.

flickr / Robert S. DonovanU.S. futures were pointing to a higher open ahead of the trading session. However, those gains are now gone, and the S&amp;P 500 is currently flat, trading at 1555. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down about 0.1%, trading at 14,530. Right now, gold is up 2%, trading around $1423 an ounce, but it's been falling for the last few hours since hitting a high of $1438.80 earlier. WTI crude oil is up 0.3%, trading around $88.55 a barrel, but is also trending downward this morning. European stock markets are still in the green across the board, with Italy and Spain leading the way, up 1.8% and 1.6%, respectively.
China retained the top spot for the third year in a row. The Eurozone, eclipsed by China in 2011, continued to decline. The attractiveness of other target markets slid as well. But there is one market whose attractiveness jumped: the USA! According to the annual survey by the quasi-governmental Association of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce (DIHK), 43% of German industrial companies with investments overseas considered China the most important target in 2013, same as in 2012 and 2011. Itâ€™s no longer just a cheap place to manufacture; the cost motive has dropped from 25% in 2006 to 14% in 2013. The growing middle class makes China a hot market for German-branded products. So the primary motive is market development, and manufacturing in China for the local market: 38% of the companies thought so, and 73% of those in the auto sector â€“ for them, China is where the music plays. Second place, the Eurozone, edged down from 41% to 40%. For years, it had been top priority, given its geographic proximity, ease of transportation, and the shared currency, peaking in 2008 at 45%, well ahead of China. That was before the impact of the debt crisis became apparent. But itâ€™s hanging in there. Despite the difficult situation and lousy demand, companies want to maintain their presence to be able to profit from the still elusive upticks in the economy. Recently, companies noticed that reforms â€“ the famous austerity â€“ have lowered costs in some countries, whittling away at the disadvantages they had compared to Germany. If the trend continues, and if demand ever picks up, more investments might flow their way. Other regions also declined on the German industrial priority list: South America down to 23% from 24%, Asia without China down to 27% from 28%, and Eastern Europe and Russia down to 25% from 26%. The only region that actually grew in importance was the US. In 2005, only 20% of the companies wanted to invest there. In 2012, it rose to 26%. In 2013, it jumped four points to 30%, the highest ever. Companies cited the growing economy (â€œgrowingâ€ in comparison to the Eurozone), the improving employment picture, and rising corporate profits â€“ that all-important juicy fruit hanging in front of them. For companies with energy-intensive processes, and for chemical companies that use natural gas as feedstock, the US looks like nirvana. Germany is phasing out its nuclear power plants, and much of its supply of natural gas depends on the not always palpable goodwill of Russiaâ€™s Gazprom which prices gas based on the price of oil â€“ a ripoff, these days. Struggling with energy costs at home, companies have taken note of the shale gas revolution in the US, and the low price of gas and electricity it engendered. So 33% of metallurgical companies, 39% of the chemical and pharmaceutical companies, and 45% of the auto sector want to invest in the US. Theyâ€™re also hoping that low energy costs would rejuvenate the American industrial base, which in turn would offer opportunities for German suppliers. The US is yet more attractive as a vast, unified market. Companies are â€œhoping for even better market opportunitiesâ€ and see â€œgrowing demand for products â€˜Made in Germany,â€™â€ the report found. Given these trends and their potential, the report exuberantly concluded that other regions are hanging on, â€œbut the rising star is the USA.â€ For Germany itself, the picture is less rosy. The index for domestic investments has plunged three years in a row, from 28 in 2011 to almost zero in 2013 â€“ growth in domestic investments has come to a standstill! Companies that invest overseas to conquer new markets also plan to invest in Germany. But companies that invest overseas for cost reasons are cutting back at home â€“ theyâ€™re offshoring jobs. For them, Germany has lost its competitive advantages. The report called it â€œa warning for Germany as an industrial location that improvements in terms of labor costs, taxes, and energy costs no longer make any headway.â€ More trouble for the already listing miracle economy. Italians are electing their 63rd government in 68 years. Normally, Europeans chuckle about this. But Italian political trouble just became EU economic trouble, and the realization that itâ€™s too big to bail out is again heating up the Eurozone debt crisis. Read.... Italian Political Trouble Just Became EU Economic Trouble.
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke won't be attending the annual Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium in August due to a "personal scheduling conflict." The event, held by the Kansas City Fed every summer in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, usually features a keynote speech from the Chairman of the Fed. In recent years since the financial crisis of 2008, the speech has been used to signal important monetary policy shifts as the Fed has experimented with unconventional monetary policy tools. As MNI's Steven Beckner points out, ECB President Mario Draghi broke tradition when he skipped the meeting last year in order to put the finishing touches on the ECB's "OMT" bond buying program, which was unveiled shortly thereafter. However, given that the symposium is a Fed-sponsored event and Bernanke is missing it due to a personal conflict, the news still seems a bit strange.
Reuters/ Steve MarcusBillionaire hedge fund manager Steve Cohen, who runs SAC Capital, will be making an appearance at Yankee Stadium today, the New York Post's Michelle Celarier reports. According to the Post, Cohen will be attending the annual Goldman Sachs U.S. Hedge Fund Symposium, a cap intro event put on by that bank's prime brokerage division.Â  Cohen, who owns a stake in the New York Mets, will be pitching perspective investors at the stadium along with other hedge fund hot-shots. HeÂ was at the event last year. Cohen's SAC Capital has come under scrutiny in the last several months over alleged insider trading. In November, the government filed insider trading charges against a former SAC portfolio manager, Mathew Martoma.Â  Back in February, CNBC's Kate Kelly reported that SAC clients had asked to withdraw $1.68 billion in the first quarter. SAC, which has $15 billion assets under management, has about $9 billion belonging to Cohen and SAC employees and the remainder is outside capital. SAC recently had a $602 million settlement over alleged insider trading with the SEC conditionally approved by a judge.Â  Cohen has not been charged with any wrongdoing.Â 
Ed note: The following is a guest post from University of Massachusetts grad student Thomas Herndon. Herndon shook the economics world last week by debunking an influential paper from Harvard econ professors Carmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff that claimed countries with debt to GDP above 90% experience much lower growth. Herndon's paper showed an Excel coding flaw was partly to blame for the result.  After the paper came out, Reinhart and Rogoff admitted the error, but said that their core point remained valid.  In this post, Herndon responds to their response, and says the core point does not remain sound, and that his work does not show that debt-to-GDP above a certain threshold makes a meaningful impact on growth. I would like to thank Business Insider for inviting me to reflect on the media coverage of the recent paper I co-authored, and to clear up any misconceptions I felt remained. Overall I think the media coverage has been very fair and supportive. I want to thank the many journalists and media outlets that helped facilitate discussion about this important policy issue, and who have shown a young graduate student, with little media experience, the utmost respect and courtesy.  I want to address here what I feel are the major misinterpretations of  our work, which will in part require engaging with the claim’s made in Reinhart’s and Rogoff’s response. First, we categorically did not impute any negative motives to the authors; and second, our results are not consistent with and do not confirm their findings.  I want to start by stating in the strongest possible terms that the purpose of our paper was not to imply that the selective omissions and unconventional weighting were, as R&amp;R asserted in response to us, “intentionally used to bias the results.” The purpose of our paper was strictly to ascertain the veracity of their results.  We know nothing whatsoever about their motives, and did not speculate on this at all in our paper. Throughout our paper we assume that their errors were honest mistakes. We also have honest differences over the appropriate methods for calculating average GDP growth figures. We did use the terms “selective” and “unconventional” to describe the problems we saw with their paper, and we believe these are accurate characterizations.  “Selective” is an appropriate description because the data were “selected” for exclusion. This does not imply that dishonest motives were at play, only that selection criterion needs to be clearly and transparently presented, so that their work is easily replicable.  “Unconventional” is appropriate in describing their averaging technique.  To use a baseball analogy, suppose we had a team with two players, and we want to find the team’s overall batting average. The first player has 100 at bats, is successful one-fifth of the time, and therefore has a .200 batting average. The second player has a single at bat, but gets on base in this one at-bat, and so has a perfect 1.000. If we use the Reinhart-Rogoff method, we would equally weight the .200 and 1.000 batting averages, and thus find that the team has an overall .600 batting average. If we used conventional methods of calculating the team’s batting average, it would more or less remain .200.  The underlying problem is not that their method is necessarily wrong, but that it is particularly sensitive to outliers. This contributed to the “perfect storm” of errors whose combined effect caused the large decline in average GDP. If the only problem was the weighting, this would not have been sufficient to cause a drastic decline in average GDP growth.  However, it was the combination of the weighting system with the exclusion – for whatever reason – that combined to cause the most significant fall in average GDP growth. There is nothing inherently wrong with their weighting system. However it is unusual and it is their obligation to be open and clear in explaining why they used this unusual methodology. Reinhart and Rogoff make the claim that their unconventional averaging method is easily observable in Table 1, which covers the larger time period 1800-2009, and that their calculations over this longer period are free from error. Reinhart, Rogoff, AER, NBER Unfortunately, the spreadsheet error actually extends to this table as well, which makes it impossible to ascertain their method from the table. In terms of my own research process, early on in the project I actually asked the very question of whether they had averaged country mean GDP growth rates instead of including each year’s growth experience for each country equally. In a meeting with one of my co-authors, we investigated this very possibility by simply averaging the means provided in the table (in Excel). The computed average GDP growth rate is 2.0, and the median is 2.2, which does not match the average reported by R&amp;R of 1.7 percent, and a median growth figure of 1.9 percent. At the time we thought that this implied that they did not use the country-averaging method.  But it is now clear that the figures they reported resulted from their spreadsheet error.  Additionally, in Table 1 from the AER publication there appears to be a transcription error. Spain’s average GDP growth in Table 1 is recorded at 2.2 percent. However, in the spreadsheet the published average of 1.7 percent is calculated with Spain’s average GDP growth at 2.8 percent. The correct average and median GDP growth from the spreadsheet are 2.1 percent and 2.3 percent respectively. Moreover, their spreadsheet error also extends to the entire rest of the summary page of their spreadsheet. Specifically, the error extends to both 1946-2009 and 1800-2009 time periods, mean and median growth, and mean and median inflation. For the entire 1946-2009 sample, rows 30-44 were used, and for the 1800-2009 sample, the rows 5-19 were used. The same countries, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Denmark and Canada, are removed in both samples.  R&amp;R write that Table 1, “does not have the same issues,” but this is not accurate.  Moreover, these computational errors also compromise other calculations on their spreadsheet.  R&amp;R state that the results of our paper are consistent with, or confirm their  finding—that, even with our criticisms of their work, we nevertheless still  observe economic growth declining significantly when public debt relative to GDP rises above the 90 percent threshold. This is not our interpretation of our work, and indeed the purpose of the second half of our paper is to argue this point. In Table 4 we show that differences in average GDP growth in the categories 30-60 percent, 60-90 percent, and 90-120 percent cannot be statistically distinguished. Herndon, Ash, PERI  In Table 5 we refute their claim that this relationship applies to a wide range of times and places by showing that it weakens as we move forward in time. Herndon, Ash, PERI Indeed, in the most recent period of 2000-2009, which in almost all cases will be the most relevant set of experiences with respect to current policy debates, average GDP growth when public debt is above 90 percent of GDP is higher than when the public debt/GDP ratio  is between 60 and 90 percent.    The findings in our paper are clearly not consistent with the notion that we consistently observe a sharp fall-off in economic growth when the public debt/GDP ratio exceeds 90 percent.   As for the misconceptions concerning causality, I encourage people to read the contribution by my professor Arin Dube. His treatment of the topic is highly readable and offers strong evidence that causality runs from slow growth to high debt. There is not one word in our paper which suggests that a high level of government indebtedness is never a problem.  It would be absurd to think that governments never have to worry about their level of indebtedness.  The aim of our paper was much more narrowly focused.  We show that, contrary to R&amp;R, there is no definitive threshold for the public debt/GDP ratio, beyond which countries will invariably suffer a major decline in GDP growth. The implication for policy is that, under particular circumstances, public debt can play a key role in overcoming a recession. The current historical moment, with historically high rates of mass unemployment in both the U.S. and Europe   and with interest rates on U.S. Treasury bonds at historic lows,   is precisely the set of circumstances under which we would expect public borrowing to have large positive effects, with comparably fewer costs. Moreover, it is precisely the set of circumstances under which we expect austerity to have substantial negative effects.  Click here to read Herndon's full paper &gt;

Global economic bellwether Caterpillar just announced Q1 revenue and earnings that fell short of analysts expectations.  Management also reduced its guidance for the year. Because CAT is so closely tied to the economy, it has unparalleled insight into what's really going on. Fortunately for us, CAT provides a pretty comprehensive and granular outlook for the global economy with its earnings announcements. Here are a few key points: Here's Caterpillar's full economic outlook:---------------------------------------------------------- 2013 Economic Outlook Our expectation for world economic growth is about the same as the outlook included with our year-end 2012 financial results. We anticipate overall world economic growth of about 2.5 percent—a small improvement from 2.3 percent in 2012. Purchasing manager indicators improved in the first quarter, and industrial production increased in the majority of countries. Both indicate that world economic growth is benefiting from monetary easing that started 19 months ago. Central banks continued easing in the first quarter, and we expect the world economy will continue to improve in 2013. Key points related to this outlook include: Developed Countries: Developing Countries: Risks

YouTube via Georgia Ports Caterpillar's earnings are out, and it's a miss. EPS of $1.31 came in short of forecasts at $1.40. Revenue of $13.2 billion is short of estimates of $13.7 billion. The company has also cut its outlook. The full report is here, and below is a key section. Note that growth in China is more challenging than expected, whereas the company remains optimistic with respect to US housing. We have revised our outlook for 2013 to reflect sales and revenues in a range of $57 to $61 billion, with profit per share of about $7.00 at the middle of the sales and revenues outlook range.Â  The previous outlook for 2013 sales and revenues was a range of $60 to $68 billion and profit per share of $7.00 to $9.00. Â  "What's happening in our business and in the economy overall is a mixed picture. Â Conditions in the world economy seem relatively stable, and we continue to expect slow growth in 2013," said Oberhelman. "As we began 2013, we were concerned about economic growth in the United States and China and are pleased with the relative stability we have seen so far this year.Â  In the United States, we are encouraged by progress so far and are becoming more optimistic on the housing sector in particular.Â  In China, first quarter economic growth was slightly less than many expected, but in our view, remains consistent with slow growth in the world economy.Â  In fact, our sales in China were higher in the first quarter of 2013 than they were in the first quarter of 2012, and machine inventories in China have declined substantially from a year ago," said Oberhelman.

After getting its butt kicked last week, gold is bouncing back a bit. It's up over 2% today, surging to above $1430/oz. At one point last week it was in the low $1300s. KITCO
Italy is having a huge day after the re-election of President Napolitano (not the same thing as Prime Minister). In addition to plunging borrowing costs, stocks are now up over 2.2%. FTSE MIB
YouTubeThe big news in economics last week was the paper by a UMASS Grad Student showing that economists Kenneth Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart had made an Excel spreadsheet blunder in their famous paper arguing that as debt-to-GDP goes above 90%, growth slows dramatically. It's easy and tempting to overstate the influence of Reinhart and Rogoff. Even if they had never existed, there would have still been an austerity movement. The "90%" paper just provided a nice science-like sounding datapoint for austerity advocates to point do. But the refutation could still be significant. Paul Krugman pointed out in a recent blog post: The point is that the next time Olli Rehn, or George Osborne, or Paul Ryan declares, sententiously, that we must have austerity because serious economists (i.e., not Krugman and friends) tell us that debt is a terrible thing, people in the audience will snicker â€” which they should have been doing all along, but now it has become socially acceptable. There's already signs that this is happening. The FT has a new story up about bond investor Bill Gross, and how he's attacking the UK austerity movement. Here's how it goes. â€œThe UK and almost all of Europe have erred in terms of believing that austerity, fiscal austerity in the short term, is the way to produce real growth. It is not,â€ Mr Gross told the Financial Times in an interview. â€œYouâ€™ve got to spend money.â€ His comments come as economists debate the effect of statistical errors in widely cited academic research by Kenneth Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart on the case for fiscal austerity. With governments in the developed world struggling to boost economic growth, the International Monetary Fund has also argued that Germany, the US and the UK are tightening their belts too fast. For one thing, it's interesting that Gross is now slamming austerity. Also it's interesting that the paragraph about Excel-gate is just dropped in there, as one of those perfunctory things that you now have to include when talking about debt and deficits. Again, a lot of austerity is just politics, and people will look for any excuse to advocate it. But in mainstream circles, the case for trying to cut debt just for the sake of cutting debt is looking a lot more tenuous.
This weekend we mentioned the latest Barron's cover, which is about the paper's professional investor survey, which shows record high bullishness and a widespread belief that the Dow is going to go to 16,000. John Hussman, the famously bearish mutual fund manager, sees this as screaming sell signal, as he invokes the ol' contrarian magazine cover indicator. He writes: The Barron’s Big Money Poll is typically bullish, on balance. This is Wall Street, after all. But variations in the tone and extent of that bullishness can be informative, especially when the consensus is extremely optimistic at new highs of mature bull markets, and defensive at new lows of mature bear markets. I can’t really throw stones about 2009, as I had my own concerns at the time (relating to the need to stress-test against Depression era outcomes, despite our favorable views of valuation). But it’s worth noting that the 2009 Big Money Poll questioned the advance from the March lows, noting “good reason not to jump in with both feet yet.” The 2003 Big Money Poll – already well into a new bull market – was bullish on balance, and up from just 43% bulls in an October 2002 poll near the market lows. Still, the 2003 poll noted “the bulls’ views have been tempered by the market’s losses in recent years. Consequently their expectations for the Dow, the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 stock index, and the Nasdaq Composite have been ratcheted down from past surveys.” This certainly isn’t a criticism of Barron’s itself. I grew up on Barron’s Magazine, and will remain a devoted reader at least as long as Alan Abelson provides a worthy counterbalance to the more short-sighted views of Wall Street and the Market Lab section remains in print. Still, the Big Money Poll is most useful as a contrary indicator. Rule o’ Thumb: When the cover of a major financial magazine features a cartoon of a bull leaping through the air on a pogo stick, it’s probably about time to cash in the chips. Anyway, this chart from Hussman says it all. John Hussman Read Hussman's whole letter here ---&gt;
This stat might blow your mind. *ITALIAN TWO-YEAR NOTE YIELD DROPS TO RECORD-LOW 1.267% -Bloomberg Meanwhile, 10-year yields are also falling to a 2-year low today. What gives? Over the weekend, the Italian parliament convinced President Napolitano to stay on for another 7-year term. The President isn't the Prime Minister, so Italy still lacks a proper government, after its split election in February, but the President does stuff like calls elections, and helps attempt to organize a government, so his agreement to stay in helps stability. And beyond that, the thinking remains in Europe that the big countries will not be allowed to go bust. Even Italy. They have horrendous growth problems that seem to be getting worse (and they lack a plan) but the actual sovereign debt problem just isn't the big worry.
Think debt, taxes, and spending are at all-time highs these days? It turns out that belief is almost totally false. A presentation from the Bureau of Economic Analysis includes three charts that everyone should see. It turns out, taxes are lower than they have been throughout most of history; debt as a percentage of GDP has been much higher in the past; and on government spending, only if you include transfer payments (like Social Security) is spending at a new high relative to GDP. If you look at actual government spending that doesn't go straight to people, it's low. BEA Â  Â  BEA Â  Â  BEA Â  Anyway, if you know anyone who thinks taxes, debt, and spending are at all-time highs, then email them this post.
Love The Beast TrailerSo far, this week is off to a much better start than last week. Remember, last week we saw a commodity plunge and some violent down days, especially in the first half. Right now, US futures are up, Japan had a big day, and Europe is higher across the board. Italy is particularly strong, with the FTSE MIB up 1.6%. Helping Italy is the fact that over the weekend, the Parliament elected the country's current President to stay on for another 7-year term. Note that this is not the same as forming a government (Italy still lacks a new Prime Minister) but this does add some stability.
GMO's Jeremy Grantham has maintained a gloomy slant on the economy. However, he does see reasons to be optimistic. Last week, The Guardian's Leo Hickman conducted a lengthy interview with Grantham.  And during the interview, he talked about how China has the capacity to completely change the face of energy. "They have it within their capabilities of coming back in 30 years with the guarantee of complete energy independence – all alternative and sustainable forever," he said "To hell with their five-year plans, they should move up to 25-year plans for alternative energy - energy security, reducing pollution and low cost..  They would have such low-cost energy at the end of it they will be the terror of the capitalist system. With low energy and low labour, that's the ball game." Here's what he said about China: China is my secret weapon. I call them the Chinese cavalry riding to the rescue. They have the capital. They have an embarrassment of capital – 50% of their GDP is capital investment. We have a shortage of capital and also have debts. Their problem is how to invest all that capital. My partners worry all the time about them wasting their money. What better programme could they possibly have, with huge social pay-off, than a massive replacement of sustainable energy? When you think what it would mean to them – it would get rid of their pollution – it makes sense. Because of that pollution, they announced recently an incredible increase of 65% in their plans to install by 2015 – just three short years away – 36GW, which is equivalent to 20 vast, state-of-art coal plants, of solar. Throw in wind, too. And, by the way, we will have many breakthroughs in storage. If I had to make a bet, I would say that's the most promising, important breakthrough of the next several years. Everyone is working on this. If you have a big smart grid – and all the desert of Xinjiang and all the wind of Inner Mongolia – and it's all swirling around with relatively little loss and you have a grid smart enough to go in there Chinese-style and turn your fridge off for half an hour to save energy, and do this and do that, you don't need nearly the back-up. The bad guys will tell you that you need 100% back-up and messianic environmentalists will tell you that you need 0%. But maybe 20% back-up will be needed as everyone is working on storage. I'm certain it will happen. Some technologies take time then go, "Bang!". Look at video conferencing. It has been around forever and the quality was terrible. But now it is so clear and instant. Technology has a habit of boring you to death and disappointing you for 20 years then suddenly it delivers a new world… I have very high hopes for China because they have embedded high scientific capabilities in their leadership class. And that is huge. They know this is serious. They can calculate the social threat of getting this pollution, weather instability, water out of control. And they are acting much faster now than we are. They have it within their capabilities of coming back in 30 years with the guarantee of complete energy independence – all alternative and sustainable forever. They have an embarrassment of capital. We have an embarrassment of debt. So they can set a stunning pace, which they are doing. And they could crank it up. To hell with their five-year plans, they should move up to 25-year plans for alternative energy - energy security, reducing pollution and low cost. They would have such low-cost energy at the end of it they will be the terror of the capitalist system. With low energy and low labour, that's the ball game. Five years into a 25-year programme and any capitalist will be urging their government to copy them.
