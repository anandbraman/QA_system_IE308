Bob McDonald, the 59-year-old CEO of Procter &amp; Gamble and a 33-year veteran of the company, has stepped down suddenly. He will be replaced by an old hand: his predecessor, A.G. Lafley (presumably on a temporary basis â€” Lafley's 65 and has already been CEO once before). P&amp;G is the world's largest advertiser, with a global media budget of more than $10 billion annually. The move comes after pressure from activist investor Bill Ackman, according to Forbes: McDonald was thought to be in jeopardy of losing his job last summer after a string of reductions to profit forecasts frustrated analysts and investors, and Ackman barreled onto the scene, unveiling a $1.8 billion stake in the company. Ackman had privately urged the companyâ€™s board last year to replace McDonald, according to the Wall Street Journal, and at the Ira Sohn investing conference early this month, the hedge fund manager had said that McDonald only had a couple of quarters to show that he could improve performance. Ackman also took pot shots atÂ  McDonald for serving on too many corporate boards, which, he claimed to have calculated, ate up 25% of his time. flickr/jordanfischerA.G. LafleyIn fact, investors began taking shots at McDonald a year ago. On a conference call at that time, Â Ali Dibadj of Sanford C. Bernstein suggested McDonald wasn't cutting it. "How much patience does the board have?" is the quote that will go down in history: Unilever or Personal Care grew 10%, J&amp;J skin in the U.S. grew 6.3%, [indiscernible] grew 6.5%, Kimberly grew 6%, all organic, all with their profitability, supposedly not through price gaps because it sounds like that's a minor issue. And I'm not sure if you can use geographic mix as an excuse anymore. So I'm just trying to understand how long do you expect investors to wait? How long does your current plan have to work? How much patience does the board have? McDonald has had difficulty getting the company to fire on all cylinders at once, according to the Wall Street Journal: Mr. McDonald reacted by refocusing on P&amp;G's core markets and products and cutting costs. The company's shares reacted, rising 26% in the past 12 months. But they tumbled last month after the disappointing earnings report. P&amp;G said its sales rose just 3% after stripping out currency movements and the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, at the low end of the company's forecast. Most famously, McDonald steered P&amp;G in the direction of "free" social and online media, only to haul it back to old-fashioned paid media when he didn't see the results he liked. He laid off more than 6,250 marketers in the process. Here are McDonald and Lafley's letters to their staff, per Ad Age: Dear P&amp;G Friends, Today Iâ€™m announcing my retirement from Procter &amp; Gamble.Â  This has been a very difficult decision for me, but Iâ€™m convinced it is what is in the best interests of theCompany and you. Replacing me will be my friend and mentor, A.G. Lafley.Â  Iâ€™m thankful that A.G. has agreed to come back to P&amp;G and carry on with the work we have collectively done to strengthen the Company, its business and its organization. During the past year, much attention has been focused on me from several angles, which has been a distraction that is not in our best interests.Â  Iâ€™ve always believed that we are a Company --Â One Company --Â comprised of great individuals.Â  When we get to a point where too much attention becomes a distraction, itâ€™s time to change that dynamic. Most important, thank you for all you are doing to make P&amp;G the great Company it is and always will be.Â  I am proud of what you have accomplished, and it has been a privilege to be a part of it.Â  During the last four years together, weâ€™ve expanded our business into many new categories and geographies.Â  By the end of this year, developing markets will account for 40% of our sales and 45% of volume.Â  Weâ€™ve launched exciting innovations with many more to come. And, weâ€™ve made significant progress on our productivity program.Â  There are many more accomplishments, and I cannot thank you enough for all your hard work and dedication. I love this Company and all of you.Â  I will celebrate 33 years with P&amp;G on June 4, and I first met A.G. the night before I interviewed.Â  I know you will give A.G. your very best effort.Â  We are on the way up, but there is more to do.Â  We have an opportunity to have an excellent quarter, and there will be many more to come in the future. My official retirement date is June 30.Â  Please know I am always available to help you in any way I am able. Best wishes.Â  I have every confidence in you.Â  I am counting on you.Â  Thanks. Bob Here's Lafley's memo: Dear P&amp;Gers, Today I am rejoining P&amp;G.Â  Iâ€™m looking forward to working with all of you again, to do what we do best and what matters most -- win with consumers. I want to thank Bob McDonald for his 33 years of service to the Company, and for his leadership.Â  Iâ€™ve known Bob his entire career, and he has real passion for doing what is right and for improving the lives of consumers around the world. Â  I also want to thank P&amp;Gers for the work youâ€™re doing to win with consumers.Â  I want to assure you that we will build on the business momentum behind the current growth strategies: Strengthening core developed market business.â€¨Maintaining strong developing market momentum.â€¨ Building and leveraging a strong innovation pipeline.â€¨Driving cost savings and productivity improvements. I will be getting up to speed on the business in the next several weeks. In the meantime, here are a few of my core beliefs: The consumer is boss --Â at the heart of everything we do.Â â€¨We create and build brands that improve consumersâ€™ lives.â€¨Innovation is our lifeblood.â€¨Every P&amp;Ger is an owner and a leader -- we are one team, with one dream, collaborating internally and competing externally. I look forward to working with you in the days and weeks ahead. Best, A.G.Â

JonesTradingMike O'Rourke of JonesTrading wales on the various Fed Heads and the Bank of Japan for having created a ridiculous situation where the entire market is just obsessed with every utterance from central bank chiefs, sucking away the oxygen from the real issues that should actually be driving markets. He writes in this evening's note that the events of the last two days are damning: Earlier this month we highlighted comments Chairman Bernanke made a decade ago ... “I worry about the effects on the long-run stability and efficiency of our financial system if the Fed attempts to substitute its judgments for those of the market.  Such a regime would only increase the unhealthy tendency of investors to pay more attention to rumors about policymakers' attitudes than to the economic fundamentals that by rights should determine the allocation of capital.”  The events of the past two days (both here and in Japan) confirm this is the environment we are in.  The situation has become so ridiculous that San Francisco Fed President John Williams had to assure the market that the Fed could increase purchases if the economy has weakened once tapering commenced.  This stems from the Bullard application of QE - using QE in the same manner as the Fed Funds rate. Although the FOMC has adopted it, the Fed Chairman has done an awful job of communicating it.  In any event, it is pathetic if the Fed needs to promise the next round of additional easing before the current easing has even slowed.  It gives the impression that markets would simply be happier with a centrally planned economy.  The reason that none of the FOMC members can give any inkling of when tapering will start is because they can’t quantify the benefits of it.  In other words, they don’t know the effects of what they are doing, they just know they need to keep doing it.
After yesterday's stunning 7% crash, the Nikkei is rebounding. In initially the gain was just 1.7%, which is now huge. But now it's up 3.3%, which means it's recouped a pretty decent chunk of the losses. Nikkei.com

Tactical Investors Will Benefit From A 'More Cyclical Stance' (Charles Schwab) Some people have spoken of a different Great Rotation – not from bonds to equities, but from defensive to cyclical sectors within the equity market. Now, Brad Sorensen at the Schwab Center for Financial Research says they are moving to a "more cyclical stance."  "We are moving our rating on the consumer discretionary sector to marketperform from underperform and moving industrials to outperform from marketperform. Conversely, we are dropping the ratings of both the utilities and consumer staples sectors to underperform from marketperform. "…While defensive have surprisingly led much of the rally to this point, valuations appear stretched to us and the move seems to be getting a little long in the tooth. In fact, even in a potential overall market correction scenario, we believe it's quite possible that the traditional defensive groups get hit worse than the cyclical that would traditionally bare the brunt of the decline, due to the run seen in the former group. Therefore, we believe tactical investors would benefit from these moves in both a further market rally, which is what we think is more likely, and in a near-term pullback, which is certainly a possibility."  Investors Should Fear These Three Things More Than Fed Tapering (Yahoo Finance) Fed "tapering" shouldn't be the biggest concern for investors, according to Michael Santoli at Yahoo Finance. He says there are three things that are more worrisome than the Fed: 1. "Another economic soft patch." 2. "A financial accident." Rates on high yield bonds are at record lows and demand for these has been strong. "This combination raises the prospect of bouts of volatility causing some unforeseen rupture in the capital markets." 3. "A sense of invincibility. …Should nothing come along soon to knock back investor expectations or cause the markets to correct lower, then the main thing to fear will be fearlessness itself." "The Bond Sell-Off: It’s For Real" (Goldman Sachs) In the past couple of weeks, U.S. Treasuries have seen a big sell-off. Goldman Sachs writes of this time, "The Bond Sell-Off: It's For Real." Francesco Garzarelli and Silvia Ardagna at Goldman say that investors have got too pessimistic on global growth, which has stunted the rise in yields, and that the bond market has been reacting more and more to economic data ever since the Fed said it would use certain economic data as a threshold to determine its interest rate policy. "Our model estimates (and, consistently, our forecasts) show 10-year Treasuries reaching 2.5% in the second half of this year, with German Bunds trading at 1.75%." Goldman Sachs Investors "Anchor" Their Market Performance Predictions And This Reflects Their Bias (Sovereign Man) James Montier's Behavioral Investing draws on two recent findings by neuroscientists that applies to investors. 1. Humans think short-term, not long-term. 2. Humans also conform to herd mentality. Montier also argues that humans have a tendency to "anchor" their calls or expectations on market returns to recent events or trends, and that this reflects their bias.  Six Brokers From Morgan Stanley And Wells Fargo Join Merrill Lynch (The Wall Street Journal) Six financial advisors have joined Merrill Lynch from Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley.

Since the Washington Post published a video of Paul Tudor Jones discussing the biggest killers in trading success — divorce and having a baby — people have been concentrating on his latter point, and calling him a sexist for it. From his speech: "As soon as that baby's lips touched that girl's bosom, forget it. Every single investment idea, every desire to understand what's going to make this go up or go down is going to be overwhelmed by the most beautiful experience which a man will never share about a connection between that mother and that baby." That's the part of his talk that has everyone riled up. But we should think about all this a little harder before we go around slamming the "s" word down. In fact, simply dismissing PTJ as a sexist distracts from the most important part of what he's said — that there are social and structural expectations of women that detract from their focus in the work place. And if nothing else, traders must be focused. I'll say this: Perhaps PTJ should have said it more delicately, but he wasn't saying that women are innately bad traders – he just said there will never be as many stellar ones as there are men. "...you will never see as many great women investors or traders as men. Period. End of story. And the reason why is not because they're not capable. They're very capable." So if not capability, what's the reason? It's time, and more than that, it's our social structure. "So now, let's take the typical female that enters the workforce. In my 20s, then I was exposed to the pits and I had this incredible ... I was getting all this information because I was there at ground zero during one of the most explosive times in history of the futures markets. So it was fantastic. So my most formative ages, which were 21 to 30, I was there again now 10,000 reps became 20 or 30,000 reps. Take a girl that was my age at that point in time, particularly back in the '70s. I can think of two that actually started E.F. Hutton with me. Within four years, by 1980, right when I was getting ready to launch my company they both got married." The problem we're addressing here is a social, structural issue having to do with gender and expectation. We're belittling it by pretending it's a problem with one man. PTJ was just plainspoken enough to talk about it in public from the perspective of someone who's trying to run a successful business. His point is that women are expected to get married, expected to have children, and expected to keep a house ... still. Because of that, there will not be as many women who choose to live the grueling lifestyle of being a trader and a mother at the same time (and become successful traders while doing it) as there are men who are successful fathers and traders. See, women go to work, come home, and do more work. The stats say it all. Report after report — working women still do the lion's share of household chores. They're expected to. Sheryl Sandberg said the most important part of a woman's career is choosing a husband. In this case, it's one who will take on tasks and duties that have been, and often still are, considered gender specific to women. As a woman in her 20s in the workplace, I can see that today is different from 1980, but not by much. Women are still expected to get married, have kids, and keep a home whether or not they stay in it all day. Men are just expected to be great providers, good at their jobs, and good fathers. They enter into marriages not knowing how to boil an egg, let alone cook a meal for their kids. Bottom line: What women fought for (and are still fighting for) is the opportunity to either stay home with the kids or get in the pits and trade without anyone raising an eyebrow. I don't fault anyone for picking either, and if more women decide to stay home and there are fewer great women traders, that's fine too — as long as they get to make the choice. The problem is that the eyebrows still rise when a woman can't do it all to have it all. Until that changes, there won't be as many women who want to work so hard at work and at home. Finally, where I don't agree with in PTJ's argument is that this can never change. It could, but it's got to be everyone, not just him, who let women make a choice about where they can really focus their energies. Whatever it is, that's a personal affair.

VimeoThe Washington Post has obtained footage of hedge funder Paul Tudor Jones from a panel discussion at the University of Virginia last month with fellow fund managers John Griffin and Julian Robertson.  During the panel discussion, PTJ made some comments that the biggest killers to trading success are divorce and women having babies.   Here's what he does when on of his manager's is going through a divorce:  "... Like, one of my No. 1 rules as an investor is as soon as my manager, if I find out that manager is going through divorce, redeem immediately.  Because the emotional distraction that comes from divorce is so overwhelming. The idea that you could think straight for 60 seconds and be able to make a rational decision is impossible, particularly when their kids are involved. You can automatically subtract 10 to 20% from any manager if he is going through divorce."  Watch the video below:  
Nanex LLC When markets opened in New York City this morning, shares of American Electric Power and Nextera Energy, two big electric utilities trading on the NYSE, took a complete nosedive. American Power briefly plunged 54%, and Nextera Energy plunged 62% â€” the question is why. To figure out what caused this crash, Business Insider reached out to Eric Hunsader, founder of Nanex, a research firm that compiles and analyzes market data. First thing's first, it's important to realize that this morning was the morning after a Fed announcement. Hunsader said that since utility stocks are impacted by moves in interest rates, it's likely that traders were repositioning themselves based on Bernanke's comments. The problem is that as they were all rushing to sell, there weren't enough buyers. "It just so happened that this morning there was no liquidity and that sector just got killed," said Hunsader. Now the question, then, is why hasn't this happened before? The explanation for that lies in regulation. The NYSE used to use a measure called the Liquidity Replenishment Point (LRP) to stop crashes like this. Basically, when an order goes in and removes a lot of liquidity in a stock, the NYSE slows down trading so liquidity can trickle back in. However, after the 2010 flash crash, regulators decided to make the NYSE dump LRPs and put them in line with the crash preventing measures other exchanges were using. NYSE objected, saying their way was better for investors, but they lost out on that one. In place of LRP, and as a pilot for one year, NYSE adopted the Limit-Up Limit-Down (LULD) system last month. With LULD, essentially, trading in a stock will halt for five minutes if the price of a stock suddenly moves up or down 5%-10% compared to the average price for the last five minutes. It's 5% for S&amp;P and large cap stocks, 10% for small stocks. Ideally, price bands should double at the open and the close, since volatility is more likely. The problem is that, until August, LULD isn't going to be implemented for the first 15 minutes of the trading day, and the last 30 minutes of the trading day at all. And that's just one thing according to Hunsader. The real problem, he said, is that creating price bands isn't enough. It's too confusing, and liquidity is gone faster than people think. "It's not going to take care of 99% of what we [Nanex] see," he said. And what Nanex sees are 2-3% drops in stocks all the time â€” mini flash crashes that pop stocks (even large cap stocks) up and down with little explanation. Usually, the market just keeps on moving, but that may not always be the case. In this case, American Electric Power and Nextera Energy are huge companies witha combined market cap of $60 billion (thereabouts), so they (in turn) dragged down the entire utilities sector. A clean 5%-10% isn't what we saw during the Flash CrashÂ either â€” which is exactly the scenario that regulators are trying to prevent. "It's going to be a nightmare when we have a big market move and a lot of stocks trip, because no one will know when to stop them," he continued. "We would like to know if the SEC tested this LULD regulation on Flash Crash data." That would be a good thing to know indeed.
Overnight, the Japanese Nikkei 225 stock index plummeted 7.3%. It was the worst single-day loss on the index since the Fukushima nuclear disaster two years ago. Even still, given how fast Japanese stocks have risen recently, that only takes the index back to the levels it was at on May 9. The general sense is that traders rushing into the Nikkei recently have been doing so in a highly-levered fashion. (That's hedge fund manager Kyle Bass's take. Nomura currency strategist Jens Nordvig agrees, as does Société Générale strategist Sebastien Galy.) "I would argue that the move is more about position squeeze than a broader macro concern," says Nordvig. "More broadly the carry trade built up over the past few months is unwinding as VaR management systems kick in with higher volatility, expect rising margin calls and the likes," says Galy. The bloodbath may be over for now – Nikkei futures are currently up 0.1% from the last close as of 2 PM ET.  Business Insider
Paul Tudor Jones and his wife SoniaLast month, legendary hedge fund trader Paul Tudor Jones made some controversial comments about why there are so few female traders at the University of Virginia symposium on a panel with Julian Robertson and John Griffin.  The Washington Post has obtained video footage of the panel via a Freedom of Information Act request. The footage shows PTJ explaining how in his view the biggest killers to trading are divorce and babies. To illustrate his point, he shared an anecdote about how two women he traded with at E.F. Hutton lost their focus after having children.   "Then they both had — which in my mind is as big of a killer as divorce is — they both had children. As soon as that baby's lips touched that girl's bosom, forget it," he said. Here's what we've transcribed from part of the footage (emphasis ours):  "You will never see as many great women investors or traders as men. Period. End of story. And the reason why is not because they're not capable. They're very capable. Like, one of my No. 1 rules as an investor is as soon as my manager, if I find out that manager is going through divorce, redeem immediately.  Because the emotional distraction that comes from divorce is so overwhelming. The idea that you could think straight for 60 seconds and be able to make a rational decision is impossible, particularly when there are kids involved. You can automatically subtract 10 to 20% from any manager if he is going through divorce. "Women, when you think about why is it that I'm here today. I'm here today because as a child I played every game in the world — I played poker, backgammon, bridge, Monopoly ... Chinese checkers, solitaire. I played every game that you could imagine and that's all I did as a child. By the time I was 21, I had a PhD in probalistic theory because I loved games. It's what I did ... So I got my 10,000 reps. "So now, let's take the typical female that enters the workforce. In my 20s, then I was exposed to the pits and I had this incredible ... I was getting all this information because I was there at ground zero during one of the most explosive times in history of the futures markets. And it was fantastic.

I just see it happen over and over. I'm talking about trading, not managing ..."   His comments ended up upseting some alumni and faculty at his alma mater.  PTJ later issued a statement to the Washington Post calling them "off the cuff remarks" at the April 26 event.

The Wall Street Journal is reporting that three senior SAC Capital executives received subpoenas as part of the insider trading investigation of the hedge fund.  Those who received subpoenas were Thomas Conheeney, SAC's president; Steven Kessler, the chief compliance officer; and Phillipp Villhauer, the head of trading, unnamed sources told the Journal. They are all viewed as part of Steve Cohen's inner circle, the report said. They have not been accused or charged with any wrongdoing.   The New York Times reported that last week that Cohen and others at the firm also received subpoenas to testify before a grand jury.  It's well-known that Cohen, who runs $14 billion Stamford, Connecticut-based SAC Capital, is the ultimate target of the government in their crackdown on insider trading. In the case against former SAC portfolio manager Mathew Martoma, Cohen has been identified as "Portfolio Manager A."  Even though he has been implicated, he has not been charged with any wrongdoing.  He may never be charged and he has maintained that he acted appropriately.   What's more, is under the statute of limitations for insider trading, if the government were going to file any additional charges in this case they would have to do so by mid-July, which is the five year anniversary of the trades in question.  
Market MakersBack in April 2011, hedge fund manager Kyle Bass advised the University of Texas (disclosure: my Alma Mater) on taking delivery of nearly $1 billion worth of gold bars. Now that bet has gone sour. WSJ's Gregory Zuckerman reports: Gold's slump has saddled the second-largest U.S. college endowment with more than $300 million in paper losses. But the swoon hasn't shaken the faith of Bruce Zimmerman, who since 2007 has been chief executive of University of Texas Investment Management Co. "We always prefer that our assets go up, rather than down, but we're not day traders," said Mr. Zimmerman, whose company invests $29.5 billion for the benefit of the University of Texas and Texas A&amp;M systems. "Gold is a hedge, and it still fills that role." Meanwhile, Kyle Bass continues to make his multi-year argument that Japan is going to blow up. And after last night's 7% decline he slammed "Macro Tourists" as being behind the selloff. This is utterly hilarious. "Macro Tourists" is a phrase that was coined by former policy economist and global macro trader Mark Dow to characterize investors who left their comfort zone to make big pronouncements about how macroeconomics really works. Kyle Bass's expertise is in private credit, mortgages, and so forth. He recently unveiled an intriguing contrarian bet on a phone book company. This stuff is his wheelhouse. He's been famously incorrect on Japan blowing up, and his arguments about a "Keynesian endpoint" is a made-up phrase. So in other words, the term Macro Tourist was originally coined to describe an investor like Bass going from private credit to global economics and sovereign debt. Now slamming other people about this? Hilarious.
Justin Beckerman / Ken BeckermanJustin Beckerman, an 18-year-old high school student from New Jersey, built and wired a fully-functional, one-man submarine. The underwater vehicle is mostly made of the lightweight, yet strong, grooved plastic typically used in piping. The construction feat is less than surprising to those familiar with Beckerman's talent â€” he's been engineering products out of various building materials since he was two years old, the teenager told Business Insider. Beckerman salvages every old or broken device he can find, along with donations from friends and neighbors, and occasional trips to electronics recycling facilities with his dad. He's built remote-controlled vacuums, miniature model jet engines, and headsets that can play DVDs. The submarine is by far the teen's biggest project to date. Justin's father, Ken Beckerman, says he learned early on to give his son space, support, and freedom to tinker with things: "[Justin] will tell me something is going to work, and to me it doesn't make any sense or its not possible. Instead of telling him that it can't happen or it's not real, I just let it sit ... I'm supportive in letting him do his thing, and letting him dream."

Market MakersAt the beginning of April, Kyle Bass went on CNBC and slammed the "macro tourists" that were driving up Japanese stock prices. Note: The term "macro tourist" refers to someone who is not a traditional macro expert stepping out of one's comfort zone to make big bets based on one's own (often flawed) notion of economics. Today, Bass blames the macro tourists for the historic 7.3% plunge in the Nikkei 225 last night. Here's what he had to say on CNBC just now: When you look at Japan, it looks to me like their industry has been hollowed out over the last 15 years, analogous to the U.S. manufacturing business getting hollowed out in the late 70s and 80s. They've been exporting jobs overseas because of the strengthening yen. So, I think the weakening yen – if you look at the balance of trade data from the Ministry of Finance, you see exports moving up about 5% year over year, but imports moving up about 3-3.5% – they still have a balance of payments deficit even after the yen has [weakened] materially from its [highs]. I don't think that it's the panacea that equity investors think it is.  I think that the people that have bought into the Nikkei – I refer to them as macro tourists – I think they are renting the stocks. They're not really owning them. And that's why you see movements like you see today. As we noted earlier, given how highly leveraged the Japan trade has been, some have been waiting for a big unwind.
Google FinanceIt's been a wild day in the markets. After trading down by 120 points earlier this morning, the Dow has rallied and even turned green briefly. Unfortunately, the same couldn't be said about Europe, which closed at its lows of the day.

France's CAC 40 fell 2.1% Germany's DAXÂ  tumbled 2.1% Spain's IBEX fell 1.7% Italy's FTSE MIB tanked 2.6%. A string of Flash PMI reports across Europe improved, but still came in below the 50-level.Â  This suggests that Europe's manufacturing and services industries are still contracting. On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke told the Joint Economic Committee of Congress that the Fed could start tapering its quantitative easing (QE) program during one of its next few FOMC meetings depending on economic data. QE is one of the Fed's economic stimulus programs, which is intended to lower interest rates through bond purchases. "Markets fear musical chairs may have started," said UBS's Art Cashin.Â  "Bernanke must bring back some sense of certainty orâ€¦Â  If bulls can regain momentum, they may claim invincibility."
U.S. Treasury yields bottomed out in July 2012 after three decades of a steady grind lower. Since then, they have had their ups and downs, but eventually, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury hit a high of 2.06% on March 11, right before the financial crisis in Cyprus blew up and the consensus began to shift its focus to fears over an emerging slowdown in global growth. That backdrop set the stage for a big rally in Treasuries as investors piled back into them, sending yields all the way down to 1.63% on May 2. In the last three weeks, however, yields have reversed violently as investors have sold bonds and are once again testing the post-low highs set in early March. And this time, Goldman Sachs says the bond market sell-off is for real (in a note to clients titled "The Bond Sell-Off: It’s For Real"). Business Insider/Matthew Boesler, data from Bloomberg "Our bond valuation models (Sudoku and GS Curve) and a separate study of the determinants of US Treasury yields which explicitly accounts for the impact of QE, policy ‘guidance’, uncertainty and the European crisis indicate that intermediate yields should be trading in the upper half of this range, given the decline in systemic risks and the brightening US economic outlook," write Goldman's Francesco Garzarelli and Silvia Ardagna in the note. "Our model estimates (and, consistently, our forecasts) show 10-year Treasuries reaching 2.5% in the second half of this year, with German Bunds trading at 1.75%." Garzarelli and Ardagna make two assertions central to their case that this time is for real: (1) investors just turned too pessimistic on global growth, halting the previous rise in yields, and (2) the bond market has become more responsive to economic data since the Federal Reserve tied its interest rate policy to specific economic data thresholds in late 2012. Here is their argument: We relate the recent sell-off in yields to a shift in expectations that had turned too pessimistic. As we argued in the April issue of our Fixed Income Monthly, 10-year government bond valuations in the major markets had departed from their macro underpinnings in a statistically meaningful way, and the likelihood of a sharp correction had therefore increased. A stronger-than-expected payrolls report acted as a catalyst, compensating for a string of moderately underwhelming economic data (our US MAP score, which compares realizations to economists’ forecasts, improved in May). More broadly, we find evidence that the US bond market returned to being more responsive to incoming economic information in comparison to the case in the second half of last year (to illustrate, the chart below plots the regression line between the US Map scores and changes in Treasury yields around the data releases). We ascribe this movement to a shift in the Fed’s reaction function. In the second half of 2012, the Fed’s forward guidance on the future path of the policy rate was linked to a specific calendar date. The introduction of ‘macroeconomic thresholds’ in the Fed’s policy guidance last December led investors to focus again on data developments. In this context, we note that market forecasts for 2013 US growth have now clustered around 2%, and that the downside risks have been revised down materially (see chart below). Goldman Sachs
Patrick Hoesly on FlickrMarkets around the world are in the red today. U.S. markets were down over 0.9% earlier today, but have since recovered some of those losses in the wake of a string of good economic news.Â  The S&amp;P is now down just 0.3%. However, Europe is still near its lows of the day. England's FTSE is down 2.1%. France's CAC 40 is down 2.5%. Germany's DAX is down 2.7%. Spain's IBEX is down 1.9%. Italy's FTSE MIB is down 2.8%. This follows sell-offs across Asia. Japan's Nikkei fell by a stunning 7.3%. On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke told the Joint Economic Committee of Congress that the Fed could start tapering its quantitative easing (QE) program during one of its next few FOMC meetings depending on economic data. QE is one of the Fed's economic stimulus programs, which is intended to lower interest rates through bond purchases. Over in China, the Flash Manufacturing PMI unexpectedly plunged to 49.6 from 50.4 a month ago.Â  A reading below 50 represents contraction, and this is the first sub-50 reading in seven months. Eurozone, German, and French Flash PMI numbers all showed improvement in May, however, all of the numbers continued to be under 50.
Last night's bad PMI number seems to have been the tipping point in a recent build up of bad Chinese data that came in last month. This morning, the Nikkei fell by 7.3%, and markets around Europe are down as well. News from Goldman Sachs earlier this week probably didn't help either. The bank exited the massive investment it made in the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China back in 2006. It was made even before ICBC became the 2nd biggest IPO in history. The stock, though volatile to say the least, is up 57.1% since that year. So, even though Goldman has sold off pieces of its stake in ICBC five times since it 2010, with all this bad news coming out about China, it's hard not to ask — why now? Does Goldman buy the China bear argument that the increasing cost of credit in the country will cripple growth? Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein was on Bloomberg TV this morning giving a firm answer amidst all the chaos. Here's what he told anchor Erik Schatzker: "Well, first of all, catch the wave when it comes-- I don't know if you've been watching but there has been a wave and it's been going on for quite some time.  It may be interrupted. ICBC, again, is not the key to our interest in China or the big reflection of it.  ICBC was an investment we made at a time when China was taking its banking system public and was looking for partners-- really, kind of quasi-strategic partner-- to help-- not only provide investment capital but also expertise. And so they wanted firms like ourselves.  And there were other financial institutions that partnered with other banks.  And so we ended up holding that investment for a while.  But through that investment we became very close with important people in the banking system.  And we maintain that relationship today.  We're investing in China because China-- I was going to say it's the future-- but it's a big part of the present as well." Blankfein went on to say that Goldman would be happy to make an ICBC sized investment again, but the time would have to be right. Does that calm anyone's nerves? Watch the full interview below:

As virtual fantasy worlds go, Blizzard Entertainment’s Diablo 3 is particularly foreboding. In this multiplayer online game played by millions, witch doctors, demon hunters, and other character types duke it out in a war between angels and demons in a dark world called Sanctuary. The world is reminiscent of Judeo-Christian notions of hell: fire and brimstone, with the added fantasy elements of supernatural combat waged with magic and divine weaponry. And within a fairly straightforward gaming framework, virtual “gold” is used as currency for purchasing weapons and repairing battle damage. Over time, virtual gold can be used to purchase ever-more resources for confronting ever-more dangerous foes. But in the last few months, various outposts in that world — Silver City and New Tristram, to name two — have borne more in common with real world places like Harare, Zimbabwe in 2007 or Berlin in 1923 than with Dante’s Inferno. A culmination of a series of unanticipated circumstances — and, finally, a most unfortunate programming bug — has over the last few weeks produced a new and unforeseen dimension of hellishness within Diablo 3: hyperinflation.   Austrian Economics and Inflation In casual use, the term “inflation” is used in conjunction with price increases. From the perspective of the Austrian School of economics, though, that phenomenon is a secondary effect of increases in the money supply. As Henry Hazlitt wrote, When the supply of money increase[s], people have more money to offer for goods. … Each individual dollar becomes less valuable because there are more dollars. Therefore more of them will be offered against, say, a pair of shoes or a hundred bushels of wheat than before. A “price” is an exchange ratio between a dollar and a unit of goods. When people have more dollars … [goods] rise in price, not because [they] are scarcer than before, but because dollars are more abundant. [1] Furthermore, inflation is not simply an increase in the supply of money within an economy; it is the increase in that portion (if any) not backed by a commensurate increase in specie: most common in history, market commodities like gold or silver. Thus fiat currencies are, unless tightly controlled as to the amounts being created versus being destroyed (with the latter typically only occurring due to wear), notably susceptible to inflation. As virtual currencies are digitally-created and not commodity-backed — therefore, not particularly dissimilar from real world currencies in this day and age — those such as Diablo 3’s gold are de factofiat currencies. In virtual economies, the primary instruments used to control the money supply are “faucets” and “sinks.” Faucets are ways through which game currency is injected into the game. This generally involve players receiving currency from the game system itself, as opposed to other players. In such situations, the received currency is created anew. Sinks are ways through which game currency is removed from the game. This generally involve players paying currency into the game system itself, as opposed to other players. In such situations, the paid currency is destroyed. [2] Examples of faucets and sinks in Diablo 3 are included below: Diablo 3 was rolled out in May 2012, and there seem to have been early concerns among players that gold sinks within the game were insufficient. One site noted, [M]ost of us (probably including Blizzard) assumed that the Blacksmith would be widely used — he was, after all, the only major gold sink in the game … but dropped items alone selling in the [auction house] have been enough to satiate the appetite [of players] and crafting is … a waste of [gold] when one could easily buy an optimal item from the [auction house] rather than pumping 50 to 170K of gold into [a Blacksmith-crafted weapon.] [3] The establishment by Blizzard of a real money auction house (“RMAH”) alongside a virtual gold auction house in the game provided players with an incentive to both farm the game for real world profits and to pursue arbitrage opportunities. The RMAH was also created, at least in part, to disincentivize players from patronizing third party markets outside the game. Nevertheless, bots — automated game participants whose sole purpose is to farm the game world for items to sell — quickly emerged. Although its anonymity may make it subject to skepticism, several weeks after the game’s debut a source claimed that there were at least 1,000 bots active 24/7 in the Diablo 3 game world, allegedly “harvesting” (producing) 4 million virtual gold per hour. [4]   Most of the gold generated by the ruthlessly productive, rapidly adapting bots found its way to third party vendors in a black market which undercut the prices in the sanctioned, in-game auction houses. The combined effect of heavy bot activity and insufficient sinks immediately impacted the gold markets, and inflationary pressures were soon apparent. An exasperated player complained in August 2012: I purchased most of my gear for around 5 mil [gold] early on. I’ve been farming for awhile [and] have saved around 30 million gold [but now] I can’t upgrade the gear I have ... Where is all this money coming from? Why is everything so expensive? [5] And as in real world economies, the price effects of money inflation often arise unevenly. With gold prices falling, prices began spiking in certain goods. Another player noted with curiosity [Y]esterday Fiery Brimstone was 150K, now almost 300K. Each time I hit refresh it seems to be going up a bit[.] [6] The RMAH had minimum and maximum dollar amounts for in-game gold transactions: $0.25 minimum, $250 maximum. Market participants were also limited to dealing in increments of a certain size, called a “stack.” The “stack” was initially set to 100K gold. But as gold prices fell owing to rapidly building supply, the stack size was changed in August 2012 to 1 million. This practice, known as redenomination, is a fairly standard (if cosmetic) method of addressing inflation, but was viewed by some players as tacit devaluation. [7] If you’re changing the [price] of gold from 0.25 per 100,000 to .25 per 1,000,000 I would like to cancel my gold auctions before you do that. You’re completely shifting the market in less than a day, and those of us that have auctions listed that will be affected by this change cannot cancel them until after the patch hits, which is potentially too late. [8] To be clear, at the time at which the redenomination was introduced, gold was still trading above the floor rate. But being artificial, caps and floors not only prevent markets from clearing, but give black markets a target to undercut, to say nothing of offering players an opportunity to avoid the 15 percent fee — another intended gold sink — levied upon transactions within the auction house. Another player predicted, [T]his [change] will likely have 2 effects … [it] could kill the private 3rd party market for gold and hopefully discourage botting … [but] because the real money price of gold is decreasing on the RMAH … [g]old will become cheaper as botters flood the market in an attempt to unload their massive surplus of gold before it becomes absolutely worthless. … This decision will further destabilize the economy [as in the gold auction house] prices shoot from 100,000 gold to 1,000,000 gold … [or] 10,000,000 gold to 100,000,000 gold. … The same would happen if the [Federal Reserve] decided to suddenly release a flood of currency into the U.S. economy[.] [9] By early 2013, the gold price had fallen to the exchange floor set by the game managers — $0.25/million — and players began to show signs of concern. One asked, Hyperinflation is the economist’s equivalent of an astrophysicist’s quasar cluster or a marine biologist’s dolphin “stampede”: a rare exhibition of a unique set of circumstances which arise infrequently and are closely studied when they materialize. Such events are exotic enough that they become legendary: many individuals knowing little about monetary policy are aware of the recent outbreak in Zimbabwe, or familiar with the defining instance in the post-WWI Weimar Republic. Economically, the tipping point in the transformation of inflation into hyperinflation is characterized by a profound drop in the outstanding demand for money: when holders of money expect the supply of money to increase — particularly without any sense of timing, bounds, or other guidance — monetary demand in the present drops in favor of surrendering money for vendibles. The focus of possessors of money, therefore, devolves into an effort to capture known, present purchasing power against the likelihood of its decline in the near future. Saving, in any event, delaying consumption, is chastened; and if a cycle of declining purchasing power and rapidly rising prices ensues, ultimately the propensity to hold money declines precipitously and may fundamentally disappear. This was demonstrated when, in a message board entry prefaced by stating “Sell Equipment before Patch 1.0.5 Hits!” (a patch is a piece of software added to an operational program or application as bugs are found, changes desired, or ways of improving performance discovered), a player warned that, Blizzard just announced that the drop rates for [certain] items are going to be doubled … if you haven’t already, you should consider converting your current gear to cash … since real $ [are] the best hedge against gold devaluation[.] [11] If historical cases of hyperinflation — real, and now virtual — have one thing in common, it is the instinct among its victims to blame the symptoms rather than the disease. The Austrian economist Hans Sennholz noted that during the German hyperinflation, “intrigue and artifice” were believed to be at work. [12] Similarly, a handful of Diablo 3 players, frustrated about the decimation of their purchasing power, expressed increasing suspicion of manipulation and conspiracy theories. [W]hy [are] certain items priced [s]o astronomically high? Many of them are not even that good yet cost 100’s of millions of gold. … I have about 45,000,000 gold saved up [and] check every few days to see if I can get any upgrades that are worth the gold, but … everything is vastly overpriced … clearly controlled by the gold sellers. [13] And, predictably, any number of baleful remedies were proposed. [14] While RMAH prices for virtual gold rallied occasionally, the prevailing direction of black market prices for virtual gold was inexorably lower as third party sellers undercut the in-game gold floor. In February 2013, Patch 1.0.7 was rolled out, introducing a range of new gold sinks intended to sop up ever-increasing virtual gold; they included new weapons and items not eligible for sale on the RMAH. One month later, with gold prices continuing to decline, a player made the following diagnosis: [A]dditional gold sinks [are] unfortunately comparable to spitting on a fire ... [they] do nothing to limit the core issue which is that players are earning gold faster than they [want] to spend it. Repairing is not a … good gold sink as it works best [for] players who are [dying]. … Crafting is the same, works well on players who can get the items to craft with … but leaves players with limited gold supply out of the picture. … The amount of gold that drops … needs to be nerfed, and not softly. [15] The effort appears to have been futile, as the growth of the virtual gold supply continued to grow. Several competing definitions for hyperinflation exist, with the strictest — an increase of 50 percent in one month — defined by economist Philip Cagan in his 1956 book The Monetary Dynamics of Hyperinflation. [16] By his definition, the Diablo 3 economy appears to have entered hyperinflation between February and March of 2013, when the black market price of gold fell from $0.20/million to $0.05/million — a decline of over 75 percent in a few weeks. [17] At around that time, a player commented that he was watching the markets collapse and gold become worthless. … So you feel rich that you have a billion or two in gold[?] … [W]ell guess what, you aren’t … there is nothing you can invest in to hold value. The only thing worth anything has become $$$. [18] With a sardonic irony that markets sometimes display, real world currencies had assumed the role of commodity gold, and virtual gold had gone the way of all flesh and fiat currencies. This, however, was still only the penultimate stage. On May 7th 8th, 2013, Blizzard rolled out Patch 1.0.8, which contained the seeds of the last, hyperbolic surge of gold superabundance. One change was the altering of the gold stack size from 1 million to 10 million per $0.25: a simultaneous redenomination and 90 percent devaluation (sitting, as the price was, at the RMAH floor) of virtual gold, targeting black market rates of roughly 4 cents per 10 million. In addition, a bug within the patch allowed users to cancel transactions in the auction house before completion, essentially allowing them to double their gold on demand. [19] In just a few hours, the already gold-swamped economy saw trillions more created: a mammoth deluge of, by then, worthless virtual gold chasing finite goods, driving prices upward in leaps and bounds. It was, at last, the hyperbolic blow-off characteristic of real world hyperinflationary episodes. Some of the price increases (in Diablo 3 gold) are shown below: And in a noteworthy departure from real world hyperinflation, rather than resorting to barter (which frequently takes the form of food for skilled labor), as runaway inflation became hyperinflation, many chat channels — through which some measure of trade was consummated — seem to have fallen empty: without a need to eat or clothe oneself in the virtual world, some players simply appear to have turned away. [20] Aftermath Blizzard quickly closed the in-game auction houses and audited transactions which took place during the blowout, banning players who took advantage of the bug and donating the proceeds of certain sales to charity. The gold stack size was also moved back from 10M to 1M. One week later, on May 15th, the above-cited items were quoted at the following, approximate virtual gold prices: radiant star amethyst, 26.1M; radiant square ruby, 375K; flawless square topaz, 8,600; star emerald, 797K; tome of jewelcrafting, 1,350. In May of 2012, the price of virtual gold was approximately $30/100,000 or $0.0003/gold. [21] As this article was completed — and bearing in mind that these prices may be erroneous, stale, or merely indications of interest — one site showed Diablo 3 gold being offered by four third party sellers at an average price of $1.09/20M, or $0.0000000545/gold: one ten-thousandth its market price one year earlier. [22] In the RMAH, virtual gold was priced at $0.39/1M. Remembering that game economies are private and players are voluntary members, there’s no explicit mandate to ensure rigid inflation control as one often sees (however rarely pursued) in public economies. That said, knowing that gaming experiences can be upended by economic missteps, there is a clear business interest for gaming firms in keeping virtual currencies and the greater economies as a whole stable. Frequently, hyperinflationary episodes have ended by substituting a currency outside the political and central banking control of a nation for the sovereign currency. During the early 1990s, during Serbia’s hyperinflation, [t]he authorities could not print enough cash to keep up. On Jan 6th, 1994, the dinar officially collapsed. The government declared the German mark legal tender … [which] end[ed] the hyperinflation. [23] Two obvious solutions for managers of virtual economies include more vigilant bot restrictions and close — indeed, real-time — monitoring of faucet output, sink absorption, prices, and user behaviors. More critically, though, whether structured as auctions or exchanges, markets must be allowed to operate freely, without caps, floors, or other artificialities. Unrestricted (real) cash auctions would for the most part preempt and obviate black markets. [24]  One also surmises, considering the level of planning that goes into designing and maintaining virtual gaming environments, that some measure of statistical monitoring and/or econometric modeling must have been applied toDiablo 3’s game world. The Austrian School has long warned of the arrogance and naïveté intrinsic to applying rigid, quantitative measures to the deductive study of human actions. Indeed; if a small, straightforward economy generating detailed, timely economic data for its managers can careen so completely aslant in a matter of months, should anyone be surprised when the performance of central banks consistently breeds results which are either ineffective or destabilizing? By no means does this analysis intend to equate the actions of virtual gaming firms with the policies of governments or central banks, or to malign their indisputably talented managers, designers, and programmers. While their actions may ultimately generate similar outcomes, central planners seek and wield power whereas the actions of commercial gaming interests are undertaken to compete with other online entertainment providers by delicately balancing opportunities for newer players with the need to continually challenge experienced players. By all accounts Diablo 3 is a great game; one hopes that with this episode passed, it will reacquire its former glory. But while decision-makers at online gaming firms can and should be forgiven for not anticipating the perilous and unpredictable torsions of rapidly expanding money supplies, the events of the last week provide a stark reminder of the power and inescapability of the laws of economics. [Editor's Note: What would be the best multiplayer video game monetary system? Should there be a fixed amount of in-game money? Should the only source of new money be “mining,” à la Bitcoin? Should there be no designated in-game money at all, so as to allow a market-selected money to arise via the barter of in-game commodities? Sound off in the comments!]
APUPDATE: The Kansas City Fed's latest report on regional manufacturing conditions is out. The headline index unexpectedly turned positive, climbing to +2 from -5 last month. Economists predicted a slighter rise to -4. Any reading above 0 on the index indicates expansionary conditions, so this is good news. Below is the full text from the release: Tenth District manufacturing activity improved somewhat, rising above zero for the first time in seven months, andÂ producersâ€™ expectations for future activity also increased. Most price indexes recorded little changes from the previous month.Â The month-over-month composite index was 2 in May, up from -5 in both April and March (Tables 1 &amp; 2, Chart). The composite index is an average of the production, new orders, employment, supplier delivery time, and raw materials inventory indexes. The rise in production came from both durable and non-durable goods-producing plants, with the biggest increase coming from machinery and metals manufacturing. Other month-over-month indexes were mixed. The production index edged up from 1 to 5, and the shipments, new orders, and new orders for export indexes also rose. In contrast, the employment index fell from -3 to -7, while the order backlog index was unchanged. The raw materials inventory index rebounded from -17 to 0, and the finished goods inventory index moved slightly higher. The majority of year-over-year factory indexes improved somewhat in May. The composite year-over-year index increased from -6 to 0, and the production,shipments, and new orders indexes also rose. The capital expenditures index rebounded from 7 to 11 after falling last month, while the order backlog and employment indexes wereÂ basically unchanged. The new orders for exports index climbed higher after reaching its lowest level in nearly four years last month. Both inventory indexes improved modestly. Most future factory indexes rebounded after falling last month. The future composite index increased from 4 to 11, and the future production, shipments, and new order indexesimproved markedly after posting four-year lowslast month. The future order backlog index edged up, and the future capital expenditure index posted considerable gains.Â In contrast, the future employment index was unchanged, while the future new orders for exports indexes eased slightly. The raw materials inventory index rose from -7 to 1, and the finished goods inventory index also moved higher. Most price indexes remained stable from the previous month. The month-over-month raw materials price index was unchanged at 7, while the finished goods price index edged down to its lowest level since July 2010. The year-overyear raw materials and finished goods price indexes moved slightly lower. The future raw materials price indexÂ inched higher from 38 to 41, while the future finished goods price index eased somewhat, indicating fewer firms plan to pass recent cost increases through to customers.

REUTERS/Noah BergerElon MuskDETROIT (Reuters) - Electric carmakerÂ TeslaÂ Motors Inc. on Wednesday paid off its U.S.Â Department of EnergyÂ loan nine years earlier than required, using money raised last week in a stock and debt offering. The automaker said on Wednesday that it wired $451.8 million to repay the full loan with interest. "I would like to thank theÂ Department of EnergyÂ and the members ofÂ CongressÂ and their staffs that worked hard to create the (Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing) program, and particularly the American taxpayer from whom these funds originate,"Â TeslaÂ Chief Executive Elon Musk said in a statement. "I hope we did you proud." Republicans have criticized theÂ Obama administration's support of new-technology companies, including struggling automakerÂ Fisker Automotive Inc, as well as electric battery makerÂ A123 SystemsÂ and solar panel makerÂ Solyndra. Both A123 andÂ SolyndraÂ filed for bankruptcy. DOE officials heralded theÂ TeslaÂ payoff in a press release. "When you're talking about cutting-edgeÂ clean energy technologies, not every investment will succeed - but today's repayment is the latest indication that the Energy Department's portfolio of more than 30 loans is delivering big results for the American economy while costing far less than anticipated," U.S. Energy SecretaryÂ Ernest Monizsaid. Moniz said more than 90 percent of the loan loss reserveÂ CongressÂ established remains intact, while losses represent about 2 percent of the overall $34 billion portfolio. DOE first offered loans toÂ TeslaÂ and other automakers in June 2009, when the companies could not arrange financing through public markets during the recession. The DOE's $465 million loan, received in 2010, allowedÂ TeslaÂ to open its plant in Fremont,Â California, and build the Model S electric car, which recently received a near-perfect score fromÂ Consumer ReportsÂ magazine and starts at $70,000 before a federal tax credit. The payoff was more good news for a company that reported its first quarterly profit earlier this month. Musk, a billionaire who owns 27.5 percent ofÂ Tesla, said on Monday that the company would repay the loan. TeslaÂ was funded privately through its first seven years after its 2003 founding, and it received the DOE loan as part of theÂ advanced technology vehicle manufacturingÂ program. After making payments last year and the first quarter of this year,Â TeslaÂ said it repaid the balance of its loan using a portion of the almost $1 billion raised last week in stock and notes offerings.

Fifty Plus NorthThe U.S. stock markets are open, and they are in the red.  Europe is doing even worse.  Asia, which has been closed for a few hours, saw Japan's Nikkei plunged a horrific 7.3%. This comes after a disappointing Chinese PMI report, which suggested manufacturing activity was actually contracting. Europe and Asia are also catching up with Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, who told us yesterday that they could start tightening monetary policy within the next few months. Bernanke has some people worried that changes made by the Fed could cause money rotate out of the stock and bond markets. Perhaps, this is what's going on today. Here' UBS's Art Cashin: Overnight Volatility – What happened in the U.S. looked to have a somewhat muted impact in Tokyo.  Japanese stocks opened higher and then fell through their own trapdoor. China's Purchasing Managers Index fell to 49.6.  Not only was that the first full drop in seven months, it moved the number into recessionary territory (China?  Recession?).  The Nikkei plunged 9% (1400 Dow points) from the high to down 7.3% (1100 Dow points).  The yield on the JGB ten year shot above 1% (that's nearly 200% since the BOJ went aggressive). The plunge in Japan, right on the back of the sharp U.S. reversal, has a sea of red ink flowing around the globe.  Bond pits are especially nervous. Consensus – A big surprise in claims could shake things up.  Markets fear musical chairs may have started.  Bernanke must bring back some sense of certainty or…..  If bulls can regain momentum, they may claim invincibility.  May you live in interesting times.  Stay very, very nimble and have a great Memorial Day Weekend!

ReutersBearish sentiment on China has returned. Recent economic data has disappointed markets and last night's HSBC Flash PMI showed that manufacturing contracted for the first time in seven months. Remember, while China has been trying to rebalance its economy towards domestic consumption, it is still largely driven by investment and exports. But "the main bear story for China," according to CLSA's Christopher Wood is that it "is taking more and more credit growth in China to deliver less economic growth." Wood says that this argument only grew legs with the release of the latest total social financing (TSF) data. TSF includes trust loans, entrusted loans, FX loans, bankers’ acceptance bills, corporate bonds, and non-financial stock sales. This was up a whopping 81% on the year to 1.75 trillion yuan, but down from 2.54 trillion yuan the previous month. In the first four months of the year, TSF was up 63% on the year to 7.91 trillion yuan. From Wood: "The increase in social financing data relates to the increase in the volume of such activity. The annualized growth in terms of the overall aggregate is harder to calculate since the PBOC has only issued social financing data since 2002. Still an estimate would suggest that  in  aggregate  terms  social  financing  outstanding  is  growing  at  an  annualized  rate  of  around  22%.  This  is  clearly  still  well  above nominal  GDP  growth  of  9.6% YoY." "This raises another issue. That is that growth rates of China credit have been bordering on the scary  since  the  massive  2009  infrastructure  stimulus  prompted  by  the  Lehman  bust  and  the related collapse in Chinese export growth. Thus, aggregate social financing outstanding, which remember includes bank lending, has soared from an estimated 121% of GDP in 2008 to 192%  of GDP in April. Another way of looking at this, as highlighted to GREED &amp; fear by one contact, is that the Rmb64.4tn surge in social financing since 2009 is equivalent to 14% of 2012 world nominal GDP." Deutsche Bank's John Horner also shared the sentiment. He recently wrote that more weak data out of China showed that "heighten concerns of  a 'broken' Chinese growth dynamic that is no longer responding to rapid credit expansion."So the two concerns stemming from this are 1. The Chinese central bank is running out of ways to help bolster growth. 2.  The Chinese economy is "long addicted to debt-financed investment-driven growth," according to Wood and needs to rebalance.
Markets are falling (although the US is not as bad as it was earlier). The big winners so far: Gold and Apple. We've explained a lot in the past about why gold and Apple move together, but the basic gist is that both represent asset classes in their own right that are uncorrelated with overall market moves. Anyway, here's a chart showing how GLD and Apple are outperforming stocks. Yahoo Finance
This morning, when New York markets opened at 9:30 AM, shares of American Electric Power and Nextera Energy, two big electric utilities, briefly plunged 54% and 62% respectively. Both companies are in the S&amp;P 500, and the flash crash brought the utilities sub-sector of the index down nearly 8% overall. The massive moves resulted in a trading halt in shares of both companies. Now, AEP is only down 1.5%, and NEE is down 1.8%. The charts below, via Nanex, show how the two stocks completely melted down over the course of only two seconds. Nanex LLC
Last weekend, internet pioneer Ted Nelson speculated that the creator of Bitcoin (who goes by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto) was actually Japanese math professor Shinichi Mochizuki. This was the latest theory in an extremely long hunt by various researchers and journalists trying to identify Nakamoto.

REUTERS/Steve MarcusNew home sales climbed 2.3% month-over-month (MoM) to 454,000.  This beat expectations for a 1.9% rise to 425,000. March figures were revised up to show a 3.5% rise to 444,000, from 1.5% to 417,000. The median sales price was $271,600, and the average sales price was $330,800. Supply of homes continued to stay tight with new homes for sale at the end of April totaling 156,000 or 4.1 months supply at the current sales pace. Economists watch the new home sales number to get an insight into housing supply, because tight supply helps support home prices. It also reflects the health of the American consumer. Yesterday, we saw existing home sales rise 0.6%, missing expectations. But the silver lining in the report was that distressed sales accounted for a smaller portion of overall sales.
Wikimedia CommonsWanderer Above The Sea Fog, Caspar David FriedrichWelcome to the rest of 2013. I certainly hope you've made some money in the first five months of the year (which was not hard to have done), because the environment seems to be changing. Before I continue, I want to remind you that this is a forecast-free blog, we only discuss what is happening and our thoughts on possibilities for the future. If you want a man to predict the future and tell you what to do, you'll find no shortage of that sort of thing elsewhere. Okay, just us adults here now... Here's where we stand - heading into yesterday the S&amp;P 500, Dow Jones and Russell 2000 had been in a three-way race to outdo each other in the record highs department. All three had been relentlessly ripping to greater heights throughout the spring and just about every sector and sub-sector had joined the rally by early April. When we didn't get the traditional Sell in May pullback that so many had been positioned praying for, things just went parabolic for a week or so. Large cap pharmas like Bristol and Lilly began putting up dotcom-esque gains, highly speculative solar stocks began populating the most active lists and hedge funds took their short-squeezing, options-chasing activities into overdrive. And then before you knew it, everyone was on the same side of the boat again. What had begun as a gentle, if relentless rally up the side of a Wall of Worry had gotten too easy and the latecomers began making up for lost time. When one shows up to a party after everyone's already been there for two hours, a few quick shots of tequila are just the thing to "get on everyone's level". Goldman Sachs had joined a host of other Wall Street firms in raising their price targets for the S&amp;P after playing catch-up for months - this week they went to 2100 for 2015, which could well have marked the highs for the year. While we had not quite been at euphoria yet as I've discussed, we were probably headed there - multiples were expanding and people began talking reckless. Jeremy Siegel ripped his shirt off and beat his chest on Squawk the other morning while the permabears had mostly flipped bullish. Stocks were missing earnings and rallying on increased dividend and buyback announcements and a feeling of invincibility began to descend. A week ago I had wondered if this was as good as it gets. And at just this moment - right as we thought we might escape the summer swoons of the past three years - Fear rang the doorbell. Jon Hilsenrath's Fed hints of last week had the effect of strengthening the dollar and pushing bonds around a bit but stocks had been unaffected. That is, until Bernanke's testimony yesterday in front of a joint session of Congress while the minutes from late April hit the wire. Then we printed yesterday's "red candle" day, an enormous outside reversal - the likes of which we hadn't seen since February. And this was not just any reversal, but a reversal from a new intraday high on the S&amp;P. The very frightening statistic that's been making the rounds overnight is that the last two times the S&amp;P 500 touched a record intraday high and then closed down more than 1% from that high were October 11, 2007 and March 24, 2000, the last two major tops for the market, both of which occurred before historic crashes. Compounding this reintroduction of fear into the US market is the Asian sell-off that's unfolding as we speak. Having rallied 70% since November, the Nikkei is currently in the midst of its 11th worst day since 1950, down over 5% overnight as JGB yields unexpectedly spike. One of the side effects of the finance minister being hellbent on creating inflation is that, well, bonds are not going to sell quite as well at auction once it's agreed that they'll be money-losers. A lousy bond auction combined with the contractionary Chinese manufacturing PMI was all the region needed to be thrown into an uproar. Turning back to the US, Dow futures are currently off 140 points as I write. Now what? On average, going back as far as we have stock market data, history suggests that we get an average of three 5% pullbacks each year, one 10% correction each year and a 20% sell-off every three-and-a-half years. The fact that we haven't had so much as three or more down days linked together since December of 2012 and nary a 2% decline year-to-date, I suppose the optimal thing would be to go lower and get that out of the way. The predominant bear case of late has been the absence of a correction and the overbought readings of every sector. A quick trip down to 1600 on the S&amp;P (formerly resistance, now support) would remove that very valid complaint and set up a new leg higher without the current exhaustion. A rally back and then failure today will strengthen the idea that a short-term top is in and we'll spend the summer playing guessing games about the Fed's next move while stocks correct or tread water. I don't see a problem with that provided it doesn't get out of hand. Given the underlying strength in housing, the improving employment trends (that matter more than anything) and the continuing problem of T.I.N.A., it's hard to see equities going bidless for very long. In my view, a resumption of the rally from here led by a thinning herd of advancers would actually be the worst thing that could happen. I'd much prefer the cool-off. And then, heaven forbid, the US economic data actually improves to the point where the Fed can actually take its foot off the gas - well, why would anyone be unhappy about that if it happened later this year? There was one thing Jon Hilsenrath did say in my interview with him on TV last night that I think is very important and clears up a big misconception. He explained that Bernanke himself will not be using the term "taper" that everyone else is bandying about. The reason why is that the Fed does not want to create the impression that one policy move will necessarily be attached to three or four others. In other words, suppose the Fed were to drop its rate of monthly asset purchases from $85 billion to some less number in one of the next meetings. This could be a one-off action with nothing else behind it, designed to temper the market's expectations and gauge the effects. I'd remind you that what Bernanke, as a self-styled "student of the Depression" fears the most, is a premature tightening a la FDR in 1937-1938, just as the nation was finally on the mend. If think that this central bank, which has just spent the last six years patiently reflating the economy, is about to yank the rug out from under it at the last moment, then you haven't been paying attention.
YouTubeBloomberg News' Duane Stanford has a feature in the new issue of Bloomberg Businessweek where Herbalife CEO Michael Johnson refutes hedge fund manager Bill Ackman's claims that the company is a "pyramid scheme."  For the piece, Bloomberg interviewed Johnson and other top Herbalife execs, toured production and distribution centers and consulted with analysts, independent research firms and market research firms.   Of all the people Bloomberg spoke to, none of them saw any red flags in how Herbalife conducts its business.   From BW:  “'These stories sometimes that we’re hearing today are 20 and 30 years old,' says [Michael] Johnson. 'For God’s sake, give us a chance to change. We’ve had some mistakes along the way, but that doesn’t say we’re a corrupt organization by any means. It’s really insulting to see the stuff that’s coming out and being taken as the truth because of one person’s financial motivation.' When asked if the company has ever been a pyramid scheme, Johnson says simply, 'No.'” Ackman, who runs $12 billion Pershing Square Capital, did not comment on the record for the Bloomberg article. Back in December, Ackman said he is selling short more than 20 million shares, or about $1 billion worth of the stock, with a price target of $0.  The premise of his bet is that he thinks Herbalife is a "pyramid scheme" and the FTC will be induced to investigate the company.   Following his presentation, Ackman's long-time rival, billionaire investor Carl Icahn, snapped up a massive long position in the company.  Icahn told CNBC that Ackman would be hit with the "mother of all squeezes." Since December 18, the trading session before Ackman publicly confirmed his short position, have risen more than 10%.  It was last trading around the $47 level.  The stock has trading in a range between $24.24 and $56.39 in the last 52-week period.   Read the full Businessweek feature here &gt;
Fox NewsHouse Speaker John Boehner said Wednesday that it is "inconceivable" President Barack Obama wasn't informed of the investigation into the IRS' targeting of conservative groups before news broke earlier this month. "It's pretty inconceivable to me that the President wouldn't know," Boehner said in an interview with Fox News' Greta van Susteren that was aired Wednesday night.  "I'm just putting myself in his shoes. I deal with my senior staff every day. And if the White House had known about this — which, now it appears they've known about it for about a year — it's hard to imagine it wouldn't have come up in some conversation." The White House has said that Obama was deliberately not told about the IRS' inappropriate targeting as it unfolded. Obama, too, has said he did not find out about it until seeing news reports on May 10. But White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said that senior White House aides learned some of the details of the probe in April and shared them with White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough. "They could have attempted to insulate the President from this news," Boehner said. "But with as many people that were involved in the audit, the number of people involved in the investigation, and the number of people in the White House that knew, it really is inconceivable that he wouldn't have known about it." When Boehner says that the White House knew about it for a year, however, he is likely referring to Deputy Treasury Secretary Neal Wolin. Wolin was briefed last year by J. Russell George, the Treasury Department's Inspector General, but George said he only outlined basic information. Watch the clip of Boehner on Fox News below:
Associated PressNomura's Jens Nordvig expounds on last night's stunning 7% plunge in Japan's biggest market. There were probably three main catalysts for the Nikkei gap lower overnight. First, the SPX had a very weak close, following confusing about Fed policy going forward. Second, the volatility in the JGB market finally saw negative spill-over effects on the Nikkei. Third, the Chinese PMI figures raised concerns about Asian growth. But the bigger issue was not the catalyst, but the size of the run-up. Before the gap lower, the Nikkei was up 50.3% on the year (and up 12.7% in May alone).Â  I would argue that the move is more about position squeeze than a broader macro concern. The Fed has not changed anything yet (and the SPX is only down 1.5% from Tuesdayâ€™s close). The JGB market now (ironically) looks calmer. The drop in the Chinese PMI was not entirely unexpected, and there is no particular reason why it should have impacted the Japanese market so much more than the other Asian markets (Kospi down only 1.2%). For more on the big Nikkei dive, see here ---&gt;

One of the hottest trades in the world this year has been Japan. Short the yen, buy Japanese stocks. It's practically become conventional wisdom. BofA Merrill Lynch Global Investment Strategy, BloombergIn fact, Japanese equities were basically the hottest major asset class in the entire world before today's bloodbath, posting 20.9% cumulative gains over the past three months alone. Last night, though, sparked by the first notable sell-off in three weeks in American stock markets – and really driven home by new data overnight that revealed the Chinese manufacturing sector has unexpectedly dipped into contraction – the Nikkei 225 plummeted 7.3%, marking its biggest single-day drop since the earthquake that ravaged Japan two years ago. That takes the Nikkei back to levels not seen since May 9 (it's been moving quickly on the way up). At least one analyst finds the drop-off in Japan reminiscent of the Lehman Brothers collapse in 2008 that unleashed turmoil on markets. "Lehman-like in Japan," writes Société Générale foreign exchange strategist Sebastien Galy in an email this morning. "Volatility in the [Japanese government bond] futures market forced the [Bank of Japan] to step in, if some sources are to be believed," says Galy. "More broadly the carry trade built up over the past few months is unwinding as VaR management systems kick in with higher volatility, expect rising margin calls and the likes." In February, when we solicited our favorite analysts for the charts that worried them most, Phoenix Partners Group Chief Equities Strategist Michael Block told us, "The Japanese 5-year iTRAXX CDS spread has come screaming tighter as bullish euphoria has taken hold in Japanese stocks and credit. When this miracle has a blip, a lot of folks long credit (including ones who are long structured products that are short these CDS and indices) are going to feel pain...and guess what?? The same folks are also short yen...long U.S. stocks...you get the picture. CORRELATION WILL BE THE DEATH OF US AGAIN." In a note, Société Générale cross-asset strategists point out that hedge funds have already begun winding down their positions in Japanese stocks after a big build-up this year. Société Générale The charts above also highlight the fact that after the dizzying run of the past few months, the Japanese stock market has returned all the way to the highs seen in 2006. In a note to clients written last night before the release of the ugly China manufacturing data, Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Chief Technical Analyst Naohiko Miyata mused on the high levels of Japanese stocks as well, warning that a big correction could be forthcoming: TOPIX reaches golden ratio  We think the wave count shown in Figure 2 is appropriate for the rise in the TOPIX index that began from 692.18 in June 2012. The advance beginning from 971.33 in April 2013 can be counted as wave 5, and once this wave runs its course we think ascending wave (1) running from June 2012 will be completed.  In calculating the wave 5 upside target, one classical approach says that the rise from wave 1 to wave 3 and the subsequent rise to wave 5 form a golden ratio.  We try applying this principle to the TOPIX. There was a 369.57pt advance from wave 1 to wave 3, and 61.8% of this figure is 228.39pt. Adding this result to the wave 3 high of 1,061.75, we get a wave 5 upside target of 1,290.14, which corresponds well with the high of 1,289.77 in morning trading today (May 23).  TOPIX could enter wave (2) correction  As of this writing during morning trading on May 23, we are not especially confident that a correction is about to begin simply because the USD-basis Nikkei average and the TOPIX have reached milestones. However corrective wave (2) is poised to begin once wave 5 within wave (1) comes to an end, and we assume this will be the largest correction since June 2012. The “first act” of the so-called Abenomics market may be coming to an end, and we think movements in the near term need to be watched closely. Miyata provides the charts below. MUMSS, from Bloomberg data The yen is up 1.75% against the dollar this morning. Japanese 10-year bond yields rose 11.5 basis points to 1% overnight, marking the highest bond yields since April 2012. European markets are heavy in the red across the board. In the United States, futures point to a 1% drop when markets open.
Flickr/ToGa WanderingsThe world markets have been rattled by last night's disappointing China Flash PMI number, which unexpectedly fell to 49.6 in May from 50.4 in April. This is the first sub-50 reading in seven months.  Any reading below 50 signals contraction. This only confirms fears that China, the world's second largest economy, is decelerating. "The reading pretty much dashed hopes of a Q2 growth recovery," wrote Societe Generale's Wei Yao in a note titled "Simply No Recovery." "In light of this report, we expect the official manufacturing PMI (due on 1 June) to follow suit and tank below the boom-bust line to 49.9," added Yao. "As the central government look committed to cautious easing only, we will continue to stay on the bearish side in terms of economic growth. Then the possible short-term positive catalyst that the financial market is so desperately looking for can only come from reform progress. The new leaders will hold a high-level meeting in the coming weeks on China’s urbanisation strategy. This should be the event to watch for."
Ethan Miller/Getty ImagesThe FHFA House Price Index (HPI) climbed 1.3% month-over-month in March.  This beat expectations for a 0.8% rise. On the quarter, the house price index was up 2.0%. February's HPI was revised up to show a 0.9% rise.Â  "The housing market has stabilized in many areas and homebuilding activity has strengthened in recent quarters," said FHFA economist Andrew Leventisin a press release. "That said, labor market weakness and still - elevated foreclosure pipelines remain hindrances to a more robust recovery." Tight supply and rising demand have helped support prices. Yesterday's existing home sales report showed that distressed sales account for a smaller percent of total sales. Homebuilder confidence is starting to pick up again, but the fall in housing starts and tight credit conditions have raised some questions about the recovery.

London, England James Montierâ€™s bible on behavioural finance, â€˜Behavioural investingâ€™, points out two recent discoveries by neuroscientists that have relevance to all investors: 1) We are hard-wired to think short-term, not long-term 2) We also seem to be hard-wired to confirm to the herd mentality A particularly intriguing experiment used by Montier to illustrate these points relates to our tendency towards â€˜anchoringâ€™. In his words, anchoring is â€œour tendency to grab hold of irrelevant and often subliminal inputs in the face of uncertainty.â€ Feel free to follow the experiment yourself: 1. Write down the last four digits of your telephone number. 2. Is the number of physicians in London higher or lower than this number? 3. What is your best guess as to the number of physicians in London? The idea of this experiment is to see whether respondents are influenced by their phone number while estimating the number of doctors in London. The results of the experiment can be seen below: www.sovereignman.com As the chart indicates, respondents with last-four telephone digits above 7-0-0-0 suggested, on average, that there were just over 8,000 doctors in London. Those with telephone digits below 3-0-0-0 suggested 4,000 doctors. As Montier concludes, â€œThis represents a very clear difference of opinion driven by the fact that investors are using their telephone numbers, albeit subconsciously, as inputs into their forecast.â€ So our thesis goes as follows. In the absence of reliable knowledge about the future, investors have a tendency to anchor onto something â€“ anything â€“ to help them predict future market returns. And what better anchor to use for future market returns than prior ones? This is where the story gets more intriguing. When looking at the UK stock market in discrete 20-year blocks, the period from 1980-1999 is the only one in the last 300-years in which inflation-adjusted returns averaged between 8% and 10% per year. www.sovereignman.com We think the story gets more intriguing still, because a good part of those returns was somewhat illusory in nature. More specifically, given that they occurred during a once-in-a-century period of extraordinary credit creation, those market returns were in large part borrowed from the future. This is the same way that governments have been funded, and their colossal bond markets servicedâ€“ by essentially loading the ultimate cost and the final reckoning onto the next generation. So it seems that investors are not anchoring their predictions of future market returns to the past, because, as the data shows, long-term real returns have been quite low. Instead, investors are anchoring their predictions to the very recent past that they have direct experience with, i.e. the twenty-year period between 1980 and 1999, even though this period was an anomaly compared to the last 300-years. If this thesis is even half correct, investors piling into stocks now on the premise of recapturing some of those 8% â€“ 10% real annual returns, are being at least somewhat delusional. The credit bubble has burst. Messily. The stock market has not necessarily woken up to the fact. This does not detract from the sensible analysis of equity market opportunities. But for any investment, its most important characteristic is its starting valuation. Buy attractive equities at sufficiently undemanding multiples and you should rightly expect to do well. Investors, however, seem to be anchoring their market predictions to recent returns of the past, therefore buying â€˜the indexâ€™ expensively, inclusive of a grotesque bubble of credit. One can expect this to end in a train wreck. Shutterstock Read more posts on Sovereign Man Â»
But nowhere is the issue as “complex,” infested with lies, and shrouded in obscurity as in Argentina. The debacle took on hilarious overtones when a Greek reporter, in her soft, harmless-looking manner, began to crucify Economy Minister Hernan Lorenzino during an interview at his office: “I have a very simple question for you, which seems very complicated these days: how much is Argentine inflation at this moment?” His response was an epic journey into obfuscation that got him entangled in such verbal spaghetti that the video, when it was released in April, went viral instantly. “We never speak about inflation, not even with the Argentine media,” an unseen aide explained after the minister had skedaddled. His jab at official inflation, however, was on target. The interview took place late last year. By April, inflation, as reported by the Instituto Nacional de Estadista, was 10.5%, down from 10.6% in March, and from 11.1% in January, its recent peak, nicely heading once again in the right direction, after having been below 10% for much of 2012. But it’s a joke – though not nearly as hilarious as Lorenzino’s verbal spaghetti. In early 2007, the staff at the statistical agency were booted out and replaced with political appointees who would toe the line on inflation and other inconvenient statistics. Since then, official inflation has been decided by edict. Private economists, brushing off these figures with a nervous smile, kick around 25% as the current annual inflation rate. Mid-May the government nodded. With elections coming up in October, President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner has to hand some goodies to her base to buy their votes. So during the impeccably timed wage negotiations, she personally met with leaders of six unions representing 2 million workers, and struck the same kind of deal she’d made with the Railway and Bus Drivers’ unions, a deal that might get close to preserving purchasing power: wages would be increased by 24%! The closest to an official and somewhat realistic CPI that Argentina has. To pour some oil on the fire, Torcuato Di Tella University (UTDT) – a non-profit private university in Buenos Aires – publishes the Inflation Expectation Survey. It measures what the public expects inflation to be over the next 12 months. For much of 2006, when the surveys began, median inflation expectation was 10%. The just-released index for April came in at 30%; and average inflation expectation rose from 34.2% to 34.9%. UTDT concedes that the public has a tendency to overestimate changes in consumer prices. Nevertheless, it’s another ray of light in an obscure environment where the government has done its darnedest to replace any visibility with lies. Yet ordinary people, managers, and investors alike need to make decisions daily based on their understanding of inflation. And they’re making those decisions – just not the way the government wants them to. The impact on the peso has been, let’s say, noticeable. In 1999, when I first traipsed around Argentina, the peso was interchangeable with the dollar one-to-one. ATMs would distribute both, depending on the button you pushed. Quite impressive. But Argentina seemed expensive, compared to other Latin American countries. And the economy was bogging down. Something was amiss. The peso mirage ended in 2001, when people cleared out their bank accounts, converted pesos to dollars, and sent them overseas. To stop this torrent, the government froze all bank accounts; only small amounts of cash could be withdrawn. The people didn’t accept this quietly, which led to the declaration of a state of emergency, and more riots. In January 2002, the government lifted the dollar-peso parity, and set an exchange rate of 1.4 pesos to the dollar. People with money still frozen at the bank had been robbed. And it never stopped. In early May on the black market, the peso fell through yet another floor: for the first time ever, it took over 10 pesos to buy a dollar. People have been scrambling to convert every peso they didn’t need at the moment into dollar bills. The official exchange rate is 5.25 pesos to the dollar. But it too is a lie, for most people. In one of those ironies that follow reckless deceitful governance, the government is running out of dollars and few people can buy them at the official rate – though the country is awash in dollar bills. Since I write so much about financial fiascos, debacles, and nightmares, I’ve been asked about ways to protect assets in this environment. Thankfully, I don’t give financial advice. Even if I did, I wouldn’t have all the answers. But I just finished reading an excellent book on precisely that topic, so I decided to review it.

AP(Reuters) - Spiking interest rates in Japan threaten to undermine, and possibly end, the recovery being engendered byÂ Abenomics. That could reverse gains not only in Tokyo stocks, but in stock markets world-wide which have benefited from Japanese liquidity. While a rebound in activity has allowed the Bank of Japan to upgrade its assessment of conditions for a fifth straight month, bond yields have risen sharply in extremely volatile conditions. Yields on 10-year Japanese government bonds have risen to 0.88 percent, nearly triple their April 5 low of 0.315 percent, just after the BOJ introduced its latest easing campaign, part of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's overall policy ofÂ Abenomics, including stimulative monetary and fiscal policy and economic reforms. "I don't think the recent rise in yields is having a big impact on the economy," Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Wednesday after a two-day BOJ policy meeting. "We will continue to monitor market moves and respond with flexibility in the pace and maturities of bond purchases and in market operations." So why are rates rising even as the Bank of Japan is buying huge amounts of bonds? In large part this is because the BOJ has been successful in convincing investors that it is deadly serious about engendering 2 percent inflation, a goal it has vowed to reach. "The implication is that the JGB market could plunge and send interest rates sharply higher in a short period of time if people actually start to believe that Mr. Kuroda will use any and all means available to create inflation," Nomura economist Richard Koo said in a note to clients. "Once inflation concerns start to emerge the BOJ will be unable to restrain a rise in yields no matter how many bonds it buys." That is both the promise and the problem with extraordinary monetary policy: market effects can move much more quickly than any recovery in the real economy. So far Japan has mostly been the beneficiary of market moves. The yen has fallen rapidly, theoretically giving its exporters an advantage, at least in profitability. And Japanese stocks have soared, engendering hopes of a wealth effect which would boost consumer spending and corporate investment. JAPAN UNUSUALLY VULNERABLE If interest rates spike, however, Japan will face a number of very serious sequencing problems. In the normal order of things inflation follows a recovery, rather than preceding it, as it threatens to do in Japan. If inflation comes first, it means the government is hit with rising debt service costs before the increased tax revenues of a stronger economy begin to roll in. With Japan having government debt of well over two times the size of is economy, the costs would mount quickly. That might get in the way of planned government stimulus and, as rates spike, could ultimately be self-reinforcing, with rises in rates causing yet more rises in rates. This, in essence, is the Japanese bond crisis thesis in a nutshell - the big bet that many hedge funds have made, and lost money on, in recent years. There is a real possibility of significant amounts of money piling in to a short Japanese government bonds bet if the spike continues. A rate spike would also gum up the credit market in Japan. Not only might people who planned to borrow and invest decide not to as rates rise, banks themselves will be hard hit. After all, banks in Japan are hugely exposed to fixed income generally and government bonds in specific. As prices of those bonds tumble, they may refrain from lending and might even need new capital. All of this could easily undo any progress in Japan, and indeed if things got bad enough, prompt policy to be rolled back or even reversed. This should matter to you even if you haven't got a single yen of Japan exposure. It is no accident that the advent ofÂ AbenomicsÂ has come alongside the most recent, and giddy, period of stock market gains in the past six months. Japan, and the BOJ, are a significant source of stimulus for the global economy, both indirectly, and directly. That is even before we think about the destabilizing effect that a Japanese bond market or banking crisis would have on the rest of the world. To be sure, none of this is pre-ordained. The BOJ has been clumsy in how it operated in the bond market, which is itself a bit of a creaky place after decades of on-off deflation, and is ill-suited to heavy volumes. Both of these issues can and probably will be resolved without great cost. Still, a near tripling of interest rates in weeks in a highly indebted country is a warning signal investors must heed.

I certainly hope you've made some money in the first five months of the year (which was not hard to have done), because the environment seems to be changing. Before I continue, I want to remind you that this is a forecast-free blog, we only discuss whatÂ isÂ happening and our thoughts on possibilities for the future. If you want a man to predict the future and tell you what to do, you'll find no shortage of that sort of thing elsewhere. Okay, just us adults here now... Here's where we stand - heading into yesterday the S&amp;P 500, Dow Jones and Russell 2000 had been in a three-way race to outdo each other in the record highs department. All three had been relentlessly ripping to greater heights throughout the spring and just about every sector and sub-sector had joined the rally by early April. When we didn't get the traditionalÂ Sell in MayÂ pullback that so many had beenÂ positionedÂ praying for, things just went parabolic for a week or so. Large cap pharmas like Bristol and Lilly began putting up dotcom-esque gains, highlyÂ speculativeÂ solar stocks began populating the most active lists and hedge funds took their short-squeezing, options-chasing activities into overdrive. And then before you knew it, everyone was on the same side of the boat again. What had begun as a gentle, if relentless rally up the side of a Wall of Worry had gotten too easy and the latecomers began making up for lost time. When one shows up to a party after everyone's already been there for two hours, a few quick shots of tequila are just the thing to "get on everyone's level". Goldman Sachs had joined a host of other Wall Street firms in raising their price targets for the S&amp;P after playing catch-up for months - this week they went to 2100 for 2015, which could well have marked the highs for the year. While we had not quite been at euphoria yet as I've discussed, we were probably headed there - multiples were expanding and people began talking reckless. Jeremy Siegel ripped his shirt off and beat his chest on Squawk the other morning while the permabears had mostly flipped bullish. Stocks were missing earnings and rallying on increased dividend and buyback announcements and a feeling of invincibility began to descend. A week ago I had wondered if this wasÂ as good as it gets. And at just this moment - right as we thought we might escape the summer swoons of the past three years - Fear rang the doorbell. Jon Hilsenrath's Fed hints of last week had the effect of strengthening the dollar and pushing bonds around a bit but stocks had been unaffected. That is, until Bernanke'sÂ testimony yesterday in front of a joint session of Congress while the minutes from late April hit the wire. Then we printed yesterday's "red candle" day, an enormous outside reversal - the likes of which we hadn't seen since February. And this was not just any reversal, but a reversal from a new intraday high on the S&amp;P. The very frightening statistic that's been making the rounds overnight is thatÂ the last two times the S&amp;P 500 touched a record intraday high and then closed down more than 1% from that high were October 11, 2007 and March 24, 2000, the last two major tops for the market, both of which occurred before historic crashes. Compounding this reintroduction of fear into the US market is the Asian sell-off that's unfolding as we speak. Having rallied 70% since November, the Nikkei is currently in the midst of its 11th worst day since 1950, down over 5% overnight as JGB yields unexpectedly spike. One of the side effects of the finance minister being hellbent on creating inflation is that, well, bonds are not going to sell quite as well at auction once it's agreed that they'll be money-losers. A lousy bond auction combined with theÂ contractionary Chinese manufacturing PMIwas all the region needed to be thrown into an uproar. Turning back to the US, Dow futures are currently off 140 points as I write. Now what? On average, going back as far as we have stock market data, history suggests that we get an average of three 5% pullbacks each year, one 10% correction each year and a 20% sell-off every three-and-a-half years. The fact that we haven't had so much as three or more down days linked together since December of 2012 and nary a 2% decline year-to-date, I supposeÂ the optimal thing would be to go lowerÂ and get that out of the way. The predominant bear case of late has been the absence of a correction and the overbought readings of every sector. A quick trip down to 1600 on the S&amp;P (formerly resistance, now support) would remove that very valid complaint and set up a new leg higher without the current exhaustion. A rally back and then failure today will strengthen the idea that a short-term top is in and we'll spend the summer playing guessing games about the Fed's next move while stocks correct or tread water. I don't see a problem with that provided it doesn't get out of hand. Given the underlying strength in housing, the improving employment trends (that matter more than anything) and theÂ continuing problem of T.I.N.A., it's hard to see equities going bidless for very long. In my view, a resumption of the rally from here led by a thinning herd of advancers would actually be the worst thing that could happen. I'd much prefer the cool-off. And then, heaven forbid, the US economic data actually improves to the point where the Fed canÂ actuallyÂ take its foot off the gas - well, why would anyone be unhappy about that if it happened later this year? There was one thing Jon Hilsenrath did sayÂ in my interview with him on TV last nightÂ that I think is very important and clears up a big misconception. He explained that Bernanke himself will not be using the term "taper" that everyone else is bandying about. The reason why is that the Fed does not want to create the impression that one policy move will necessarily be attached to three or four others. In other words, suppose the Fed were to drop its rate of monthly asset purchases from $85 billion to some less number in one of the next meetings. This could be a one-off action with nothing else behind it, designed to temper the market's expectations and gauge the effects. I'd remind you that what Bernanke, as a self-styled "student of the Depression" fears the most, is a premature tightening a la FDR in 1937-1938, just as the nation was finally on the mend. If think that this central bank, which has just spent the last six years patiently reflating the economy, is about to yank the rug out from under it at the last moment, then you haven't been paying attention.
Lenovo Group Ltd's bold acquisitions in its flagship PC business, a foray into mobile gadgets, and a relatively light debt load are setting it apart from PC rivals as industry shipments take their steepest fall in decades. Lenovo, a sliver away from unseating Hewlett-Packard Co as the world's top PC maker by shipments, posted on Thursday an estimate-beating 90 percent rise in quarterly profit, its fastest in seven quarters. "They have been aggressive in acquiring several distributors in different regions such as Brazil, Europe and Japan over the past few years, so that basically gave them better distribution, as well as gains in market share," said Warren Lau, an analyst at Maybank Kim Eng Securities in Hong Kong. The Chinese PC maker posted net profit of $126.9 million in the quarter ended in March, up from $66.8 million a year earlier, based on Reuters calculations using full-year and nine-month financial data. That beat expectations of a $110 million net profit and was the fastest pace since the first quarter of the 2011/2012 fiscal year, when growth doubled. Research firm IDC said global PC shipments fell 13.9 percent year-on-year in the first quarter of 2013, the biggest decline since it began tracking the market on a quarterly basis in 1994, as consumers switched to mobile computing and Windows 8 sales fell short of expectations. With shipments unchanged in the first quarter, Lenovo is outstripping other vendors. PC shipments from HP, Dell Inc, Acer Inc and Asustek Computer Inc fell by 11-33 percent during the same period, IDC said. The latest IDC data showed that Lenovo's market share was 15.3 percent, just 0.4 percentage points lower than HP. Lenovo shares far outperformed those of its rivals last year. This year Lenovo, up 3 percent, is still beating Acer. Dell and HP have staged strong recoveries, but Lenovo's quarterly net profit has risen consistently over the past few years. By contrast, HP's net profit was down 32 percent and Dell's was down 79.5 percent year-on-year, according to the companies' latest quarterly financial results. For the full year, Lenovo's net profit rose by a third to $635.1 million, it said in a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange, beating an estimate of $618.2 million in a poll of 31 analysts by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. STRATEGIC BUYS Lenovo has spent heavily over the past few years to strengthen its PC business, with purchases such as Brazilian electronics maker CCE last year, Germany's Medion in 2011 and IBM's PC business in 2005. Its slew of acquisitions has also sparked market talk that it might be interested in IBM Corp's server business, as well as handset makers Research In Motion Ltd and Nokia Oyj. Lenovo has declined to comment on the rumors. Lenovo has cash totaling $4.5 billion, vastly outweighing debt of $423 million, and giving it the muscle for more buyouts. HP and Dell have total debt of $28.2 billion and $7.2 billion respectively, compared with their cash balances of $12.6 billion and $10.9 billion. "We expect Lenovo to remain acquisitive as it is hungry for growth and so despite high cash balances they will not hike the dividend," said Jefferies technology analyst Ken Hui. The Beijing-based company has shed its staid image as the maker of all-business ThinkPads, and now churns out multi-colored IdeaPad Yoga convertible ultrabooks which have helped build its brand in China and beyond. Though newer to smartphones than to its core PC business, Lenovo is the No.2 smartphone and media tablet vendor in China, a success it hopes to duplicate in other emerging markets such asRussia and India, where competition from Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, Apple Inc and others is fierce. "They are in the right niche markets and hitting the right segments at the right price points. But this is not sustainable in the long run unless the mobility business steps up," said a Hong Kong-based technology banker.

Flickr / noahwesleyAccording to data compiled by Bloomberg, U.S. corporations have a record $1.73 trillion of cash sitting on their balance sheets as of the end of the first quarter. This comes even as executives ramp up cash dividends and stock buyback plans. Much has been made about these cash hoards as it reflects hesitation to reinvest and pursue growth. However, the cash also represents a corporate distaste for financial leverage, as many debt-laden companies struggled to navigate through the recent financial crisis because of the freeze up in the credit markets.
via Quartz The numbers: They were good. PC maker Hewlett-Packard reported a 32% decline in profit, but that still beat analyst expectations. Net revenue was also down by 10%, but the company raised the lower end of its annual forecast by $0.10 to $3.50 earnings per share. The takeaway:  Costs fell by almost 9% in the second quarter, which helped HP’s bottom line. HP also had better than expected performance in both enterprise services (which cater to corporate customers) and its printing business. That helped offset the expected decline in the division that sells PCs, which saw a 20% drop in revenue. What’s interesting: Considering the ongoing drama about CEO changes andother missteps at HP, investors rejoice when the company beats their low expectations. Shares rose almost 14% in after hours trading. CEO Meg Whitman deserves credit for executing on her turnaround plan. But the question remains: What to do about HP’s ailing PC business? Cost cuts only get a company so far. After that, it’s all about winning more business.

AP An international study on recessions and governments' responses to them has found that cuts to healthcare systems prompted by fiscal austerity are making matters far worse—for both governments and society. David Stuckler, a sociology professor at Oxford University and co-author of the book "The Body Economics," told CNBC on Thursday that responses to recessions had not only been inadequate and counter-intuitive but had caused widespread deaths because of a reduction in access to healthcare and medicines. "Austerity in health is a false economy, these epidemics are going to cost a lot more to clean up than they would have cost to prevent in the first place," Stuckler told CNBC Europe's "Squawk Box," citing research he conducted with physician-epidemiologist Sanjay Basu. "We've looked at different types of fiscal multipliers and found that public health has one of the largest fiscal multipliers of up to 3 euros return for every one euro invested, whereas other forms of spending such as defense and bank bailouts tend to flow out of the economy leading to trade deficits." Stuckler's comments come as European leaders meeting in Brussels on Wednesday appeared to be turning away from austerity policies by announcing programs to boost employment and growth. The reversal may be too late for some healthcare systems such as Greece's, which has seen money for some departments cut by up to 50 percent. (Read More: Depression, Suicides Rise as Euro Debt Crisis Intensifies) Stuckler's research adds to a growing body of evidence of rising suicides, alcoholism and disease in parts of Europe that have been hard hit by fiscal austerity. "Recession hurts but austerity kills," Stuckler said, citing Greece as "one of the worst cases in the middle of a public health disaster." Stuckler's research found a 200 percent increase in HIV infections in Greece after HIV-prevention budgets were cut as part of a 40 percent reduction in the Greek healthcare budget. Malaria too has returned to southern Greece,though it had previously been eradicated in the 1970s, Stuckler said. Recent history should also be a warning to Europe's leaders. Stuckler and Basu found that one million deaths in Eastern Europe during the 1990s could be attributed to austerity and government divestment programs. In the U.S. too, healthcare cuts have in the past proven dangerous, according to the authors. (Read More: Hippie Commune Thrives as Europeans Tire of Chaos) "New York officials in the 1990s cut their anti-Tuberculosis budgets only to then be faced with a drug-resistant outbreak of TB that ended up costing $1.2 billion," Stuckler said.

Youtube/trumpYou're fired.Under the headline, "Yes, heads should roll at the IRS," Ezra Klein points out that, at the very least, "A number of IRS employees developed criteria that was politically biased both in appearance and in effect. They were reined in once by their superiors, and then they changed the criteria again, and had to be reined in a second time. Their actions called the fairness of the agency into question and kicked off a national scandal. Even if their intent was pure, they showed bad judgment, more than a bit of incompetence, and perhaps even a touch of insubordination." That's reason enough to fire them, he concludes, "even if the process is difficult." He is absolutely right. But a larger question goes unexamined in his article. Is it too difficult to fire government employees who've been caught misbehaving in ways everyone agrees to be unacceptable? It's an urgent question for anyone whose preferred policies presume a well-functioning bureaucracy staffed with capable civil servants to oversee and implement them. It behooves us to remember that the IRS and federal, state and local government encompass a lot of honest, hard-working people whose contributions are unsung and who hate scandal and incompetence as much as anyone. But having observed government at all levels for the last decade, I can't help but conclude that the majority of proficient public employees are seeing their agencies and reputations suffer because it is excessively difficult to terminate the worst of the worst. Associated PressWhat caused me to reach that conclusion? Not a belief that federal employees should be as easily terminated as at will employees in the private sector. Unlike private sector workers, federal employees serve beneath presidents, which is to say, ideologue politicians with a bad habit of installing hack cronies wherever they can. Similar dynamics are often present at the state and local level. In theory, it would be possible to afford too little protection to public employees, which would result in a less efficient government. But top to bottom, we're far closer to the opposite extreme. A Los Angeles Times investigation, "Firing teachers can be a costly and tortuous task," provides a number of examples that unfolded at the local level. The article contains shocking anecdotes about how hard it was to fire individual teachers whose cartoonish misdeeds are detailed. The most alarming line states, "Jettisoning a teacher solely because he or she can't teach is rare." That's at one of America's biggest school districts. The UC police officer caught on camera pepper-spraying student protesters is an instructive example at the state level. I wrote last year about his long, lucrative goodbye: "As of 2010, Lt. Pike's salary was listed at $110,243.12. Using that figure as an approximation of how much he was compensated this year (note we're excluding benefits and pension) think about what that means: by my calculation, he spent 256 days on paid leave. That's roughly $77,170 in salary that taxpayers paid him, getting nothing in return. Is that a prudent way to spend public resources? Or would it make more sense to have a system where Lt. Pike could have been publicly fired by UC Davis months sooner, upon the release of independent reports concluding that he behaved badly?" There are many more examples at the local, state, and federal level. None so far has prompted Democrats or progressives to acknowledge that public employees are so well-protected that the ability to run well-functioning institutions is sometimes being compromised. In one way, the IRS controversy is sure to be unrepresentative since it is getting so much more press than almost any other act of wrongdoing by federal employees. But it will afford us a high-profile opportunity to watch the process play out. Politico explains the difficulties involved in firing anyone in the present controversy. Will protections for the IRS employees responsible for this mess wind up making it harder than it ought to be to reform the  agency? Coming days and weeks -- or will it be months? -- will tell.

PARIS (AP) â€” International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde is facing questions at a special Paris court Thursday over a controversial financial deal that she oversaw as French finance minister. The 2008 arbitrage deal handed about 400 million euros ($520 million) to magnate Bernard Tapie to settle a dispute with state-owned bank Credit Lyonnais over the botched sale of Adidas in the 1990s. Tapie was close to then-French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who was Lagarde's boss. Critics have said the deal was too generous to Tapie at the expense of the French state, and that the Adidas case shouldn't have gone to a private arbitration authority because it involved a state-owned bank. More broadly, the deal was seen by many as an example of the cozy relationship between big money and big power in France. And the case threatens to sully the reputation of Lagarde, who has earned praise for her negotiating skills through Europe's debt crisis and is seen as a trailblazer for women leaders. Lagarde, smiling at reporters, left her Paris apartment Thursday morning and appeared at a special court that handles cases involving government ministers. She has denied wrongdoing. Investigators opened an inquiry in 2011 into possible charges of "complicity to embezzlement of public funds" and "complicity to forgery." The probe may not result in a trial. If it does, and if Lagarde were to be convicted, she could face up to 10 years in prison, according to prosecutors. She and the Washington-based IMF were aware of the probe when she took over as managing director of the fund from Dominique Strauss-Kahn in 2011. The IMF has expressed its confidence in Lagarde throughout the investigation. In March, French investigators searched Lagarde's Paris home. Her lawyer said at the time that Lagarde welcomed the search as a step toward proving her innocence. French Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici told Le Monde newspaper this week that the government may seek to annul the arbitration deal if enough evidence emerges of wrongdoing. Tapie â€” a flashy tycoon and former football club owner who has served as an actor, singer and government minister â€” insists that he deserved the settlement. He says the investigation into the deal is "bogus," a politically motivated hunt by the governing Socialists against Sarkozy's conservatives. "Lagarde's fate doesn't concern me," Tapie said on Europe-1 radio Thursday. "When evidence is discovered, then we'll talk." Tapie himself may be targeted in a separate probe.

Flickr/Bui Linh NanHANOI, Vietnam (AP) â€” One mistake by a clumsy crane operator caused a 10-hour blackout over about a third of Vietnam, exposing the fragility of the nation's power grid. State electricity company EVN said in a statement Thursday that the blackout occurred Wednesday after the crane operator knocked a tree down onto the main north-south high voltage power transmission line. The outage covered 22 of Vietnam's 63 provinces. It was not clear how many people were affected, but the loss of power forced scores of garment and seafood factories to close, and traffic was snarled in major cities as traffic lights failed. State-owned newspaper Thanh Nien reported that the incident cost EVN $700,000 in lost revenue. Vietnam's power generation sector needs modernizing, but low tariffs are making foreign investors wary about returns.
REUTERS/Yuri GripasFederal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke spooked the markets on Wednesday when he told the Joint Economic Committee of Congress that the Fed could start tapering its quantitative easing (QE) program during one of its next few FOMC meetings depending on economic data. QE is one of the Fed's economic stimulus programs, which is intended to lower interest rates through bond purchases. Bernanke has no shortage of critics. But UBS's Paul Donovan is a fan. "The Fed's dependence on data flow to determine policy is exactly what a good independent central bank is supposed to do," writes Donovan today.Â  "Better that than being hostage to the whims of political action (Japan) or inaction (Euro area), which undermines policy independence.." "The Fed giveth, the Fed taketh away."
Flickr/Ian SaneMarkets are getting banged up around the world this morning.Â  And the U.S. markets haven't even opened yet. But futures are pointing to an ugly trading session with Dow futures down 148 points and S&amp;P 500 futures down by 19 points. And things will only get busier with a lot of economic data coming out. Here's a preview from Calculated Risk's Bill McBride:
Mead calls that first scenario, “Bladerunner with food stamps.”  Mead: It’s likely that an information age welfare state would consist of two components: straight out welfare and “social inclusion” payments for some, subsidized make-work jobs (like Postal Service employment in an age of email) for others. … If the information economy works like this, the whole country would start looking more like California and New York City: unbridgeable class divides, huge inequality, fountains of innovation, and tiny islands of great wealth and privilege surrounded by proles on the dole. Inside the glittering bubble, the digirati and their courtiers would live lives of intense purpose and excitement. Outside the bubble, meaning would be the good in scarcest supply. . … Bellies will be full, but lives will be empty, and with that emptiness will come ills of every kind: addiction, brutality, ugly, and stunted sexual and emotional lives for many, neglect of the young and the old. But it doesn’t have to be that way, Mead writes. We can have a future of rising wages, plentiful middle-class jobs in the IT age. His suggestions: 1. “First, make hiring easy and cheap.” Get rid of employer-based social insurance and pension programs. Let government pay for the employer’s share of social insurance out of general tax revenues. 2. “Put the service economy and especially small business and entrepreneurship front and center.”  Barriers to entry must fall. Regulation that make it difficult to start a business or enter a profession must be reformed.  ”Zoning and housing policy should look for ways to encourage homes to be used as workplaces as well as living spaces.” 3. “We need to feed the state to the people even as we individualize its services.”  End government monopolies on providing what are thought of as government services. “Turning bureaucratic government institutions into voucher-based programs will both stimulate the rise of a new type of service-oriented industry and provide better tailored government services at a reasonable cost.” Of course, right now we are doing none of these things. At this point, Obamacare is a disincentive to hire full-time workers. And liberals have attacked conservative ideas to inject more choice and competition into government programs. Does Washington have an explicit entrepreneurial agenda? I don’t think so. Mead’s essay make a great companion piece to Brink Lindsey’s excellent new book, Human Capitalism, where he notes a disconnect between the demand for high-skill human capital and out current ability to widely provide a fertile environment for its development. His similar agenda: 1) maintain economic growth by encouraging entrepreneurship, 2) reform K-12 education by unleashing competition, 3) compensate for disadvantaged environments through early childhood interventions, 4) combat social exclusion of low-skilled adults, 5) improve higher education by limiting tuition subsidies, 6) remove regulatory burdens to entrepreneurship and upward mobility.

As the global equity and bond markets grind ever higher, abundant signs exist that we are once again living through an asset bubble – or rather a whole series of bubbles in a variety of markets. This makes this period quite interesting, but also quite dangerous. With equity and bond markets at or near all-time record highs, with all financial assets consistently shrugging off bad – or worse – news as the riskiest of assets continue to find consistent upward bids, we find ourselves in familiar and bubbly territory. I can summarize my thoughts in one sentence:  How could this be happening again so soon?  In times past, it took one or more generations between bubbles for people to financially recover and forget the painful lessons before they would consider doing it all again. Yet here we are, working our way through our third set of bubbles in less than two decades, which must be some sort of world record. I will confess to my biases right up front: I have always been deeply skeptical of both the practice of running up debts at a faster pace than income (the common practice of the entire developed world over the past several decades) and the idea that the solution to too much debt is more debt, enabled by cheaper money courtesy of thin-air money printing. In short, instead of seeing central banks as sophisticated stewards of intricate monetary policies, I view them as serial bubble-blowers and reckless debt-enablers whose only response, when confronted with the inevitable consequences of their actions, is to serve up more thin-air money at an even cheaper rate. And when that doesn't work, then they simply try even more of the same, but in larger quantities. While I think central banks are populated by earnest people with impressive credentials who have rationalized their actions as being necessary and in service of the greater good, I also think that the biggest ones hold an entrenched set of institutional views that are dogmatic, fail to incorporate the idea of economic and resource limits, and are seemingly immune to healthy introspection. Somewhere along the way, I would have hoped they might have noted that each new crisis is larger than the one before – necessitating an even larger response that begets an even larger crisis next time, etc., and so on. A corporate bond hiccup in 1994 led to monetary loosening that enabled the development of the Long Term Capital Management (LTCM) fiasco of 1998, which was followed by the tech bubble, and then the housing bubble, and here we are with a now global equity and bond bubble that is larger than all the prior bubbles combined. Much larger. It was famously said that the market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent. And if the trading maxim, don't fight the Fed, is worth heeding, then surely one should absolutely not take on all of the central banks at once, either. So, the risk I run here in seeing things through my 'common sense' filter is that perhaps this time the Fed, et al., have got it right, and a true and lasting recovery is at hand. With that caveat, in this report I lay out the five most worrisome signs that horrific market losses await the unwary, the careless, the reckless – and those who possess all three characteristics (i.e., your average central bank). These are not normal times. The degree of separation between reality and today's financial markets is extreme, which means they have a tremendous degree of potential energy stored up that could erupt in a downward cascade at any time. While we can’t predict the exact time or trigger of a market avalanche back down to reasonable levels, I can definitely advise that you do not want to be standing in the valley when it happens. Here are the four things that convince me that we are in truly bubbly territory: The Fed, et al., have been buying up all of the 'safe' bonds, with the twin intents of driving down interest rates and chasing investors into riskier assets. With lower yields comes (hopefully) more borrowing; and when investors move towards riskier assets, this drives up the equity markets – which, as the thinking goes, will paint a rosier picture of the economy plus boost consumer confidence and spending. Along with this, however, we find speculators and investors, starved for yield, chasing the junkiest of the junk. Indeed, the prices of these "assets" have recently been driven to all-time record highs, which means that their yields have hit record lows. And not just "low" prices, but a brand new record low in all of financial history. It was just over a year ago when Greece ten-year debt was yielding a whopping 30%, reflecting the poor economic fundamentals of the country and concern that the European Central Bank (ECB) might stop loaning Greece the principal and interest payments needed to prevent another default. Oh yes, and let's not forget that just a year prior, more than $130 billion had been lost by Greek bond investors, which created a ripple effect across Europe, including recently crippling Cyprus' key banks. Today? Greek ten-year debt is under 10%. May 15, 2013 Investors are returning to Greece, lured by receding fears that the troubled country will leave the euro and the high returns offered by many of its battered assets. It is a remarkable turnaround. Only a year ago, Greece was toxic territory for investors. A debt restructuring had just wiped out more than €100 billion ($130 billion) in government bonds. The stock market stood at one-tenth its 2007 levels. A political earthquake had the country poised for a chaotic election. But now the markets have turned. Months of relative calm in Europe – and the pressure to go somewhere, anywhere, for yield in a low-interest-rate world—has investors taking another look. The Athens stock market has rallied more than 80% in the past 12 months, with the Athex Composite Index rising 0.8% on Tuesday. Greek government bonds have been on a tear since June.  The real story here, about speculators – not ‘investors’ – returning to Greece, is that the world is so utterly starved for yield that even Greek debt seems reasonable now. In Greece, even as the trend towards buying Greek debt was building, the country's economy (as measured by unemployment and GDP) deteriorated sharply. As compared to 2008, Greek GDP in 2012 shrank by 20%, and current trends continue to show 5%-6% shrinkage in 2013:  (Source) In what sort of a world does serious economic contraction, spiking unemployment, extremely high levels of debt-to-GDP, and falling bond yields go together? A bubbly world, that's where. The poster child for a bubble market has to be Japan, where the main stock index of the island nation, the Nikkei, is up an astonishing 70% in the past six months (!) in a vertical index rise that is well outside of our personal experience:  This isn't some penny stock, but the entire stock index for the world's third largest economy. Of course, the 'reason' for this rise centers on the actions the Bank of Japan is taking to debase its currency. The people of Japan are realizing that they cannot trust their cash and had better put it to use somewhere besides their bank accounts before its purchasing power is drained away. After such an obviously unstable spike in the market, what's left to do but officially deny that it's in a bubble? Stock Boom Isn't a Bubble, Says BOJ's Kuroda May 15, 2013 TOKYO—The Bank of Japan's governor played down worries that the stock-market boom is a bubble and that a weak yen will stir cost-push inflation, signaling his resolve to press ahead with the bold monetary easing that has fueled stock prices and driven down the currency. Grilled by lawmakers during a session of the upper-house budget committee, Haruhiko Kuroda flatly rejected an opposition-party member's argument that the recent rapid rise in the Tokyo stock market is out of line with Japan's real economy. "At this moment I do not think they are in a bubble," Mr. Kuroda said. Driving this bubble is the determined resolve of the BoJ to make the yen worth less, perhaps even someday worthless. For a major world currency, the chart below is quite startling.  If something is not official until it's denied, then the Japanese stock market is most definitely in a bubble. It should be noted that there are similar examples of stock indexes making new highs on bad news and weak fundamentals the world over, so we're not just picking on Japan alone here. My final sign of that we are in bubble territory is when the folks who consider it their job to make sense of the high and spiking prices offer up thin, sometimes stretched-to-the-breaking-point, rationalizations for why the current price action make sense. In the late 1990s, when the third most recent Fed bubble was cooking along, stratospherically valued technology shares were justified with strange metrics such as 'impressions' and 'eyeballs' and other contorted valuations contained in no standard finance methodologies. In the 2000s, when the second most recent Fed bubble was cooking along, housing prices were justified with trite slogans such as "they're not making any more land, you know" and bizarro claims that housing had never gone down in price over time – which it most certainly had. Today is no different. We're seeing the same sorts of 'explanations' to justify high prices fueled by central bank printing. Perhaps the central cheerleader for the benefits of perpetuating central banking policy errors is Paul Krugman, who recently swept aside arguments for an equity bubble by saying something that Irving Fisher might recognize: O.K., what about stocks? Major stock indexes are now higher than they were at the end of the 1990s, which can sound ominous. It sounds a lot less ominous, however, when you learn that corporate profits— which are, after all, what stocks are shares in — are more than two-and-a-half times higher than they were when the 1990s bubble burst. Also, with bond yields so low, you would expect investors to move into stocks, driving their prices higher. (Source) This sounds reasonable until you consider the context of this argument about corporate profits, of which an economist like Krugman ought to be fully aware. Corporate profits are in very, very unusual territory (one could even say record territory), and to say that equities are fairly valued now because of their relationship to corporate profits is to argue that such profitability is a new and permanent feature of life. The economist Irving Fisher somewhat famously and regrettably opined in 1929 (right before the stock market crashed) that a new corporate model and economic era was in play that had led to a "permanent plateau of prosperity." The rest is history.  In life and investing, there's nothing quite so powerful as reversion to the mean, which in the case of corporate profits is nearly 50% lower than where they currently are. By the time that economists are dismissing the notion of an equity bubble by pointing out heightened corporate profits, without providing any of the necessary context, we are in full-blown rationalization mode – which is another bubble indicator. Also, the fact that Mr. Krugman is citing "low bond yields" as a justification for moving into stocks rather delightfully skips over the reality that it is the central banks themselves that are responsible for those low bond yields. Krugman presents the information as if such intervention were a normal market condition to which investors were rationally reacting, rather than a completely fake circumstance engineered by central banks conducting the biggest monetary experiment in human history. Next, we have this tidy explanation from Goldman Sachs, groping for reasons to explain why stocks always seem to go up no matter what: "while equity prices respond more to dovish surprises than hawkish surprises, the results suggest that equity prices typically go up regardless of whether the Fed policy surprise is positive or negative (“good news is good for equities, and bad news is good for equities”). But it is not at all clear why the equity market should systematically buy into this pattern." (Source - Zero Hedge) This is at least as honest an appraisal of the situation as I can find. Goldman Sachs is basically waving its hands in the air and saying that it's somewhat puzzling why markets should be acting this way. An even more honest statement would continue by noting that such periods of irrational exuberance are quite often found during bubbles, and that bubbles have a bad habit of destroying wealth. As is common in life, such justifications merely expose the 'human factor' of bubbles. Bubbles require a belief system to be installed in the beholder, and two things that beliefs are exceptionally good at are gathering supporting data and rejecting contradictory data (if such data is even seen in the first place). The human mind does this all the time with respect to our own level of ability, our luck, our good looks, our children's performance – you name it – this is just part of our innate mental programming. The really odd part in this story is that once upon a time, bubbles were separated by a generation or more, so that the lessons (and pain) of the prior one could be culturally forgotten before the next one could take hold. Yet here we are, working on our third bubble in a row – larger than the prior two that just happened within the past 15 years. (Of course, with a wide enough lens, we might say that each bubble was just a subset of the largest credit bubble in all of history that began building some 40 years ago). For some reason, we are forgetting the lessons of the past faster than ever before. Such willful ignorance invites a series of reality-based reversions more punishing than ever before, too. My advice: Keep a journal. These are interesting times; possibly not to be repeated in many, many generations. There are abundant signs that the world's equity and bond markets are ignoring risk and chasing yield to dangerous extremes. Various denials and justifications are being offered to rationalize these behaviors as sensible or prudent. Taken together, this tells me we are once again in bubble territory, and that, as with all bubbles, this one will end badly. Or rather, these bubbles (plural) will end badly together. I'm sure that most market participants have it in their minds to dance as long as the music is playing and to be among the first to reach the exits when the music stops. However, everybody is thinking this, and given that only the most well-connected of market players have the opportunity to exit first (literally in the blink of an eye), very few will actually make it through the doorway unscathed. As is always true in life, the point of a bubble is to separate the most people from the most wealth. The wealth doesn't actually vanish; it's just simply transferred from the last purchasers to those who sold before the bursting. I truly have no idea how much longer all this craziness can continue. I suspect the answer is a lot longer than anybody suspects, myself included. But I also know that reversals tend to happen quite quickly, all on their own, with very little warning. This leads to my personal motto: I'd rather be a year early than a day late. In Part II: Protect Your Wealth in Advance of the Bubble's Bursting, we detail our rationale that all this ends in a wrenching market crash (Phase I), which will be followed by even larger, more desperate, and unusual central bank actions (Phase II) that will initially set the stage for what seems like a recovery but ultimately terminates in the largest currency crisis of modern times, if not human history (Phase III). The difficulty will be avoiding being whipsawed throughout, losing wealth at every step. After all, the primary outcome of every attempt at money printing in the past has been a massive wealth transfer from a very large proportion of the afflicted society to a much smaller one.

MarkitPreliminary May manufacturing and services reports in Europe are coming in stronger than expected, but they're still signaling contraction. According to Markit, eurozone flash pmi climbed to 47.7 in May, up from 46.9 in April.Â  Manufacturing PMI increased to 47.8 from 46.7 a month ago.Â  Services PMI improved to 47.5 from 47.0 a month ago. According to economists surveyed by Bloomberg, the flash PMI was expected to improve to just 47.2. While this is better than expected, any reading below 50 signals contraction. Within the eurozone, France's flash PMI was unchanged at 44.3. The manufacturing subcomponent improved to a 9-month high of 45.5 from 44.4 in April. Germany's flash PMI climbed to 49.9 from 49.2.Â  Manufacturing PMI improved to 49.0 from 48.1 in April. Â  Markets across Europe continue to be deep in the red.
Japan, which has seen an extraordinary rally this year, saw an epic pullback today. The Nikkei plunged 7.3%. That's the equivalent of 1,117 points in the Dow (it closed at 15,307 yesterday). This is the biggest sell-off since March 2011, when Japan was hit by a tsunami. "A short-term reversal has been long overdue," said DoubleLine's Jeff Gundlach in an email this morning. The sell-off followed warnings from the Federal Reserve that it could begin to taper its monetary stimulus programs within a few months should the economic data warrant it. A major catalyst for the global sell-off also seems to be the unexpected contraction signal seen in China's manufacturing industry. Here's what the Nikkei looked like on Thursday via Bloomberg: Bloomberg For some context, here's the 1-year chart: Bloomberg
Following a flood of initial public offerings (IPOs) that lasted several years, China’s local A-share market has been in an IPO drought since late last year. There is some speculation China’s regulatory body, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), may allow some IPOs to trickle back into the market this year, but we don’t yet know exactly when or at what volume. I’ve invited my colleague Eddie Chow to share his perspective on why IPO issuance has been halted in China’s local market, and where we see potential opportunities in the current environment. Eddie ChowExecutive Vice President/Managing Director Templeton Emerging Markets Group Eddie Chow In the past year or so, the performance of China’s local (A share) market has been a bit disappointing to many investors. However, we still find the market attractive and think there are reasons to be optimistic going forward. We felt an overabundance of IPOs in China’s local Shanghai and Shenzhen (A share) markets in the past few years likely contributed to weak performance in secondary listings during that time frame. In the A-share market, IPOs raised RMB 103.4 billion in 2012, 282.4 billon in 2011 and 491.1 billion in 2010. To put this in context, the total market capitalization of the A-share market was RMB 22.877 trillion in 2012, 21.330 trillion in 2011 and 26.322 trillion in 2010.  Some of these IPOs weren’t receiving the level of review or scrutiny that perhaps they should have, so late last year China’s regulatory body, the CSRC, stepped in and put a halt to new listings. All IPO candidates and their underwriters were asked to complete a self-review and resubmit their 2012 financial reports. The CSRC also stepped up its efforts to prevent fraud, announcing random audits of these companies, which are ongoing. Many IPO candidates subsequently decided to withdraw applications, or put them on hold.  Generally speaking, we think the CSRC’s efforts are headed in the right direction. The latest campaign is aimed at requiring IPO companies to be more accurate in terms of issuing their information so that they give investors a full picture of their businesses. The authorities are holding many investment banks and even auditors personally responsible for the accuracy and assessment of the quality and fundamentals of the companies. The focus is on seeking to ensure high quality and a good business structure for the applicants. The CSRC has also set up new delisting rules, which we view as a positive, the key being in the execution. As this campaign continues, we think we could see more pending IPOs in the queue fall out. As of March 31, the CSRC said it had received the self-review reports from 610 companies; 107 companies submitted an application to suspend their listing effort as a result of failing to complete the self-review, and 162 submitted an application to terminate. To put those numbers in some context, there were a total of 2,492 domestic-listed companies in China’s securities market at the end of 2012, according to the CSRC. The CSRC is under some pressure because so many companies are on the waiting list, and they want to make sure they are doing a thorough job vetting them. It won’t be easy, and requires a lot of resources. State-owned enterprises (SOEs) generally have a good paper trail, so it should be easier for auditors and underwriters to track and sign off on them than perhaps other companies. The CSRC’s process therefore could tilt the market toward SOEs, but not because of any bias. If companies dropping out of the IPO process are of good quality and simply suffered a business downtrend last year, they can find other channels for funding, including issuing bonds or listings overseas, or even private equity. The capital market should naturally give higher valuations to companies with better dynamics. The public’s confidence has been somewhat shaken, so we think this process should ultimately strengthen the market and win back investors.   Connecting IPOs and Market Performance  While a new rush of IPOs could cause secondary listings to again suffer, market performance is nearly impossible to predict, particularly when comparing China’s local A-share and overseas H-share markets. While they do diverge at times, we don’t believe one of these markets can consistently and radically outperform the other if they are driven by the same set of economic fundamentals. The A-share market might have outperformed at times this year due to news or rumors  (e.g. halting  approval of IPOs), but there will likely be periods of both over and under performance in either market. Within an environment of global quantitative easing, equity markets have generally performed well in recent months, whetting investors’ appetites for more risky assets, or those with historically higher short-term volatility. We cannot predict how long this trend will last, but we expect the market could be volatile given how quickly investor sentiment can shift, even if the long-term outlook for the global and Chinese equity markets remains favorable. Better outlook guidance from corporate management after earning results could provide a bullish catalyst, but we believe China’s equity markets could be vulnerable in the next 3-6 months or so because of the high expectation of a quick recovery in China’s economy, and the high expectation that the government will quickly move forward on reforms following the People’s Congress in March.   However, valuations in many stocks in the A-share market look reasonable to us at this time and, according to our analysis, are trading at a discount to comparable H-share listings, particularly in the banking and the automobile sectors. While we continue to focus on the fundamentals of individual companies and build our portfolio from the ground up, we are currently finding what we think are attractive opportunities in banks, automobiles, healthcare and pharmaceuticals. China’s Future We remain confident about China’s prospects and continue to search for long-term investment opportunities there for a number of reasons. It’s our expectation that, as disposable income increases for China’s middle class, more personal assets could be funnelled into savings and investments. Many consumers in China have been benefitting from annual increases in income of 20% or more. In addition, urbanization is continuing, and the government is devoting more resources to infrastructure and subsidized housing as well as extending social security, education and health benefits to new migrants to the cities.  In addition, China’s President, Xi Jingping seems to be laying out a strong reform program with specific timetables and goals. An anti-corruption campaign recently went into full swing, and it seems likely that in some regions, government officials will be required to declare their asset holdings within the next one to two years. The new leaders also aim to increase efficiency of decision making. The implementation of China’s 12th Five-Year Plan should also encourage businesses, calling for a rebalancing of China’s economic growth toward domestic consumption and reforming the financial and social welfare systems. Overall, despite the challenges and volatility, we think the outlook for China’s stock market looks bright.  (For more information on the different equity markets in China, read Mark’s previous post, “The ABCs of China’s Share Markets.”) Investment Adventures in Emerging Markets - Notes from Mark Mobius  Mark Mobius, Ph.D., executive chairman of Templeton Emerging Markets Group, joined Templeton in 1987.
