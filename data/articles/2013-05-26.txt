The final budget surplus figure for 2014 will fall somewhere between $1.2 and $4.4 billion, depending on who's counting.Â  "An unexpected surplus is fueling an argument over how the state should respond to its turn of good fortune," writes Nagourney. Just three years ago, of course, the state was running a $60 billion deficit. The surplus is almost certainly the result of wealthy Californians trying to bank capital gains before the Bush tax cuts expired, Nagourney says. But however it got there, state officials are already bickering over whether the money should be set aside or used to revive mothballed programs. Read the full report on NYTimes.com &gt;
The weekend is over, and trading has officially whirred to life in Asia. The big market that everyone's watching is obviously Japan, which crashed 7% on Thursday, before coming back modestly in Friday trading. That comeback, however, faded as Nikkei futures traded throughout the day, and now the Nikkei cash market is catching up. The Nikkei is currently off 2.8%, and USDJPY is below 102. Nikkei.com
Thomas HerndonThis weekend, economists Kenneth Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart dropped a bomb on the economics world in the form of a big open letter to Paul Krugman, blasting him for his uncivil and nasty tone in the debate over recent years. Remember, Rogoff and Reinhart were the economists whose work showed that growth for nations dropped off notably once debt to GDP crossed the 90% threshold. This result was shown to be flawed by UMass Amherst grad student Thomas Herndon, who discovered an Excel flaw in their work. In their open letter, Rogoff and Reinhart dispute the popular notion that they were keeping their data secret. They write: The accusation in the New York Review of Books is a sloppy neglect on your part to check the facts before charging us with a serious academic ethical infraction.Â  You had already implicitly endorsed this from your perch at the New York Times by posting a link to a program that treated the misstatement as fact. Fortunately, the "Wayback Machine" crawls the Internet and periodically makes wholesale copies of web pages. The debt/GDP database was first archived in October 2010 from Carmen's University of Maryland webpage.Â  The data migrated to ReinhartandRogoff.com in March 2011. Â There it sits with our other data, on inflation, crises dates, and exchange rates.Â  These data are regularly sought and found for those doing research who care to look. The greater disclosure of debt data from official institutions is testament to this.Â  The IMF began to construct historical public debt data only after we had provided a roadmap in the list of our detailed references in a 2009 book (and before that in a 2008 working paper) that explained how we had unearthed the data.Â  Our interaction with scholars and practitioners working on real world questions in our field is ongoing, and our doors remain open. So to accuse us of not sharing our data is an unfounded attack on our academic and personal integrity. Remember, part of the Thomas Herndon story is that he couldn't replicateÂ Rogoff and Reinhart's result (that debt dropped off precipitously at 90% debt-to-GDP) and then discovered a flaw only once Carmen Reinhart sent him a copy of their Excel document, at which point he noticed a flaw. Via email, we asked Herndon his precise take on what happened, and what he makes of their claim that their data was always made available. Long-story short, Herndon agrees that they did post links to their data sources, but never the spreadsheet, and that it was the spreadsheet that allowed the flaw to be discovered.
Guang Niu/Getty ImagesIn a major speech reported by The New York Times' David Barboza and Chris Buckley, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang says the Party will now more actively embrace market forces and encourage private, foreign investment into Chinese industry. "The market is the creator of social wealth and the wellspring of self-sustaining economic development,” Li says. The speech is being hailed as unprecedented in its embrace of capitalism. Writing on his blog, Nobel economist Gary Becker called the above line a "remarkable admission." The exact wording for the key policy proposal in Li's speech, according to a directive Barboza and Buckley cite, is, “promote the effective entry of private capital into finance, energy, railways, telecommunications and other spheres.”   The Party also wants to begin taking steps to allow market forces to determine bank interest rates, it says. Analysts say the speech is in response to concern that sluggishness in the Chinese economy is lasting longer than leaders desire. China's manufacturing index contracted for the first time in seven months this past week. Becker points out that the Party will face extreme opposition from state-owned enterprises, which have been the principal beneficiaries of China's protectionism. He writes: China’s new leaders have now made clear that the country needs to rely much more on the creativity and resourcefulness of the private sector if it is to move beyond middle income status, and become a major economic power as measured not only by aggregate GDP, but also by per capita GDP. It remains to be seen whether even the new leaders can overcome the strong opposition of SOEs and other special interest groups to the implementation of a major shift toward the private sector. Barboza and Buckley say foreign investors will now also have opportunities to invest in logistics and health care in addition to the above-mentioned sectors, but note the directive does not provide exact details.
YouTubeScott Sumner is one of the pre-eminent advocates of the idea that the Fed should engage in Nominal GDP targeting, as a way of getting us out of the crisis now and smoothing economic cycles in the future. But while he is a big advocate of Fed easing, he considers himself to be a conservative (despite the fact that many on the right these days are associated with gold and hard money). And in recent post (via @noahpinion) he argues that the last six months have actually been a disaster for a lot of modern liberal ideas. He cites six reasons for this. We summarize in bullets: Sumner's bottom line: Rather than crowing about how they were "right", liberals like Krugman should show more humility.
If you haven't seen it, then you should check out a chart of Greek borrowing costs. You might do a double take. Quietly, demand for Greek debt has jumped quite a bit, as the market feels that the country may have turned the corner for real this time. Here's a 6-month chart of yields on the Greek 10-year bond. Bloomberg In SocGen's latest "On Our Minds" note, strategist Michala Marcusen says that Greece is one of the top things that clients are asking about right now. Marcusen writes: TOP CLIENT QUESTIONS WILL 2013 BE THE LAST YEAR OF GREEK RECESSIONâ€¦ â€¦IS MORE DEBT RESTRUCTURING IN THE PIPELINE? An upgrade by Fitch to B- from CCC on 14 May, praise from the EU Commission on continued progress and first hints that the spill-over from Cyprus was not as bad as feared have built hope that 2013 â€“ as forecast by the EU Commission â€“ could be the last year of recession in Greece. Further boosting hopes, was the news that early bookings show that 17 million tourists are expected to visit Greece after 15.5 million last year, attracted by lower prices. The next key data to watch is May PMI (due 3 June). Although, still deep in contraction territory, the 21- month high of 45 observed in April (up from 42.1 in March) has helped underpin the more hopeful mood. The EU Commission and IMF forecast GDP growth at -4.2% in 2013 and see the first year of positive GDP growth since 2007 in 2014 at 0.6%. Our own forecasts, however, are considerably more downbeat with growth forecast at -10.3% in 2013, -4.2% in 2014, -0.6% in 2015 and only turn positive to +0.9% in 2016. On the short-term dynamics, we note that the -5.3% yoy decline in GDP in Q1 combined with an already weak end to 2012, offers a negative base effect. By our estimates, the remainder of the year would have to see significant positive growth to meet the Commission/IMF forecasts. With leading indicators still in recession territory, this seems challenging. Bottom line: Things are improving, but clearly they are still tough. To us the biggest story is that Greece as a positive story is being talked about at all.

Flickr/Inessa AkhmedovaLOS ANGELES Michael Ray Smith and his wife, Barbara Jean, are exceedingly pleased about what they are not going to do on their coming vacation: travel or sightsee; visit museums; go to plays, movies, or amusement parks; window-shop; gamble. The list goes on: They will not visit family or friends, play cards, hike, water-ski, sky-dive, or go bungee jumping. Instead, the college professor and his wife, an elementary school teacher, have chosen to fill their daily activity schedule for four weeks straight with just two agenda items: (1) diddly, and (2) squat. "We do read, but the main event is to do absolutely nothing," says Mr. Smith, a communication studies professor at Campbell University in Buies Creek, N.C. "Our goal is to recharge, reboot, disconnect, mentally let go." He says they still have to water the plants and cut the grass, "but mostly we practice the fine art of porch- or gazebo-sitting." RECOMMENDED: Top 5 ways to save on your summer vacation The North Carolina couple has a 20-by-30-foot wooden deck facing a stand of trees that blocks sight of the neighboring house. They have an electric fan to foil mosquitoes, and several sofas and deck chairs arranged for relaxation â€“ and nothing else. This will be their third year in a row in which they have spent a month exploring the virtues of idleness over activity. "I think this is what everyone needs, especially educators," says Smith. "Time off is not just time off, but time to recharge." The Smiths represent a growing trend in America. Evidence is mounting that as people eye the beckoning barn door signaling "summer" â€“ Memorial Day weekend â€“ most don't seem able to disconnect from the workplace like they did in the old days. The word "vacation" originates from the Latin "vacatio," meaning freedom from occupation. Yet, despite all the wistfulness that term might evoke â€“ for Arcadian days of youth frolicking at beaches, lakes, or mountain cabins â€“ more and more people can't free themselves from their laptops or daily lives that have become as frenetic as a food processor. Here is some of the mounting evidence from a 2012 survey from Fierce, Inc., a Seattle-based leadership development and training firm, that queried more than 1,000 executives and employees in multiple fields about their vacations: â€¢ 58 percent said they received no stress relief from their time off. â€¢ 27.3 percent of employees, in fact, felt more stressed after vacations. â€¢ 41.6 percent of workers checked in with the office at least every other day. â€¢ Only 8.9 percent of respondents achieved what they considered a state of complete relaxation while on vacation. If all this lack of letting go smacks of hired consultants defining a problem so they can sell you a solution (more on this later), consider the growing lexicon being born before our eyes. In just the past few years, several terms have popped up and become commonplace to describe an America that is too plugged-in and overactive, including "nomophobia" (fear of being out of mobile phone contact), "attention fragmentation disorder" (focus flitting incessantly from one medium to the next), and "FOMO" (fear of missing out on any social media missive, from an iguana video to a recipe for lutefisk). The solution to these problems, of course, has its own vocabulary: "techno-fasting," "braincation," "digital detox." There are also new definitions of "roughing it" (leave your cellphone charger at home) and "back to basics" (cancel your cellphone plan altogether). Vacations are no longer about just getting away for a few days, or even weeks, but rather figuring out how to pursue nothing during your time off. Take that cooking course you've been putting off for years? No. Hammock time? Yes. Bike through Patagonia? No. Meditation retreat? Yes. Pound the pavement of Boston's Freedom Trail? No. Feet up on Aunt Mina's creaky wooden porch in Akron, Ohio? Yes. "In short," says Janet Sternberg, an assistant professor at Fordham University in New York who studies societal responses to stress, "unplugging has become fashionable, and unplugging can be an important step on the path to doing nothing." Somebody call Jean-Paul Sartre and ask him to crack off a tome on the existential goal of "no goal." Actually, check that. People are already writing that treatise. According to Dr. Sternberg, Douglas Rushkoff, a social critic, and Tiffany Shlain, a digital-media expert, have suggested that people set aside "technology sabbaths" â€“ periods of time, each week, in which families disconnect from technology and focus on alternative activities. Sternberg also points to Susan Maushart's 2011 book, "The Winter of Our Disconnect: How Three Totally Wired Teenagers (and a Mother Who Slept with Her iPhone) Pulled the Plug on Their Technology and Lived to Tell the Tale," which describes a six-month experiment at untethering her family from their media habits. Relevant as well, says Sternberg, is writer Richard Louv, whose 2005 bestseller about saving the Digital Generation from "nature deficit disorder" â€“ by introducing them to that quaint thing called the woods â€“ was followed up with another book: "The Nature Principle: Reconnecting with Life in a Virtual Age." "[T]he future will belong to the nature-smart â€“ those individuals, families, businesses, and political leaders who develop a deeper understanding of nature, and who balance the virtual with the real," writes Louv. "The more high-tech we become, the more nature we need." * * * RenÃ©e Peterson Trudeau and her husband, John, had been looking forward to a wedding anniversary trip to New Orleans for more than a year. The couple from Austin, Texas, had plans to feast on decadent food and late-night beignets, soak up cultural sites, and ply the world-famous jazz haunts of the French Quarter. But when the trip was just three weeks away, both saw spikes in their workloads, so they mutually agreed to dramatically shift course. "We both frankly confided to each other that although we had been looking forward to this romantic getaway for a long time, upon reflection, what we really needed more than the rich food and stimulation was to keep things simple, rest, relax, and immerse ourselves in nature," says Ms. Trudeau, a life coach and author. They booked a remote cabin in an old-growth forest in Big Sur, Calif., where they hiked, explored the coast, and took naps. They came home refreshed, rested, and happy. "This change of plan taught us that sometimes when we do less, we experience more," says Trudeau. "Being more intentional and designing a vacation that allowed us lots of time to rest and soak in natural wonders was exactly what we needed." George Simpson will be relaxing by overlooking a body of water early this summer, too â€“ just from a different vantage point. Mr. Simpson, who owns a public relations business in Connecticut, will be going with his family on a Mediterranean cruise from Athens to Istanbul, Turkey, in June. They want to get away from friends, neighbors, the office, teachers, employers
The Office / NBCLast week, BusinessWeek columnist Liz Ryan stirred things up by publishing a column titled "The Truth About Sex At Work." Sex at work, Ryan suggested, is a lot more common than most people think. So instead of acting like a bunch of mortified Puritans about sex at work, Ryan continued, we should just acknowledge the reality and talk about it. Well, we wanted to find out just how prevalent sex at work really is these days, as well as what folks think about it. So we put together a sex-at-work survey. Some of the results were quite startling. And with about 2,500 responses, this was one of the most popular surveys we have ever done. So, without further ado...
If you want to find "austerity" in the United States, the clearest place to look is at the state and local government level. Here's a look at total employment (red line) vs. public sector employment (blue line) going back to 2007. The public sector has been a net drag on the economy virtually every month, even up until now. FRED Anyway, the NYT reports today on a key phenomenon happening around the country. Contrary to the predictions of all the people predicting a muni-collapse, states are increasingly flush with cash, reporting budget surpluses. That even includes California! Now there's a fight on what to do with the cash, rather than a fight on what to cut. Calculated Risk, of course, has some great thoughts on the matter, but the big one is that the state and local drag is mostly over. This chart from Calculated Risk shows how state and local spending has been a net drag on the economy every quarter since the recession. CalculatedRisk With states now deciding how to put that extra cash to work, those red lines should turn positive.
REUTERS / Tim ShafferThis past week saw the stock market sell-off a bit. With markets near all-time highs, is it possible we've seen the top? "They come and go," said Jack Bogle, warning that the market is probably due for a 25-50% sell-off. "I went through one in 1973-1974, I went through one in 2001, 2002, 2003; I went through another one 2008-2009. They're kind of scary â€” often terrifying â€” but it's typical." Indeed, the bears seem to have an overwhelming number of reasons to be worried. We've compiled 21 big warning signals that are keeping the stock market's bulls on edge and its bears on the sidelines. First, there are signs that the latest buyers are buying recklessly. Also, there is a lot of proof that the outlook for demand is deteriorating, profits are falling, and profit margins are too optimistic. And it's not just a single company or industry sending warning signals. The breadth of warnings is both historic and startling. If you're an investor thinking about making a move in the stock market, then you should probably consider these warning signals.
WikipediaEconofeuds just got real. Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff â€” the two economists whose paper on the negative effects of high debt loads was exposed as flawed by a grad student â€” have written a long letter to Paul Krugman, blasting him for being uncivil and unprofessional in how he treats them in his writing. The letter is quite long, not just going through Krugman's tone, but also in going through his past work and their past work to defend the work they continue to do. Here's the key personal bit. Cambridge, Massachusetts, May 25 2013 Dear Paul: Back in the late 1980s, you helped shape the concept of an emerging market debt overhang.Â  The financial crisis has laid bare the fact that the dividing line between emerging markets and advanced countries is not as crisp as once thought.Â  Indeed, this is a recurring theme of our 2009 book, This Time is Different:Â  Eight Centuries of Financial Folly.Â  Today, the growth bind of advanced countries in the periphery of the eurozone has a great deal in common with that of emerging market economies of the 1980s. We admire your past scholarly work, which influences us to this day.Â  So it has been with deep disappointment that we have experienced your spectacularly uncivil behavior the past few weeks.Â  You have attacked us in very personal terms, virtually non-stop, in your New York Times column and blog posts.Â  Now you have doubled down in the New York Review of Books, adding the accusation we didn't share our data.Â  Your characterization of our work and of our policy impact is selective and shallow.Â  It is deeply misleading about where we stand on the issues.Â  And we would respectfully submit, your logic and evidence on the policy substance is not nearly as compelling as you imply. You particularly take aim at our 2010 paper on the long-term secular association between high debt and slow growth. That you disagree with our interpretation of the results is your prerogative. Â Your thoroughly ignoring the subsequent literature, however, including the International Monetary Fund's work as well as our own deeper and more complete 2012 paper with Vincent Reinhart, is troubling.Â Â  Perhaps, acknowledging the updated literature-not to mention decades of theoretical, empirical, and historical contributions on drawbacks to high debt-would inconveniently undermine your attempt to make us a scapegoat for austerity.Â  You write "Indeed, Reinhart-Rogoff may have had more immediate influence on public debate than any previous paper in the history of economics." Setting aside this wild hyperbole, you never seem to mention our other line of work that has surely been far more influential when it comes to responding to the financial crisis.Â  Specifically, our 2009 book (released before our growth and debt work) showed that recoveries from deep systemic financial crises are long, slow and painful.Â  This was not the common wisdom at all before us, as you yourself have acknowledgedÂ  on more than one occasion.Â  Over the course of the crisis, and certainly by 2010, policymakers around the world were using our research, alongside their assessments, to help justify sustained macroeconomic easing of both monetary and fiscal policy fronts.Â  Your desire to blame our later 2010 paper for the stances of some politicians fails to recognize a basic reality:Â  We were out there endorsing very different policies.Â  Anyone with experience in these matters knows that politicians may float a citation to an academic paper if it suits their purposes.Â  But there are limits to how much policy traction they can get with this device when the paper's authors are out offering very different policy conclusions.Â  You can refer to the appendix to this letter for our views on policy through the financial crisis as they were stated publicly in real time. Â We were not silent. Very senior former policy makers, observing the attacks of the past few weeks, have forcefully explained that real-time policies are very seldom driven to any significant extent by a single academic paper or result. It is worth noting that in the past, polemicists have often pinned the austerity charge on the International Monetary Fund for its work with countries having temporary or permanent debt sustainability issues.Â  Since its origins after World War II, IMF programs have almost always involved some combination of austerity, debt restructurings, and structural reform.Â  When a country that has been running large deficits is suddenly no longer able to borrow new funds, some measure of adjustment is invariably required, and one of the IMF's usual roles has been to serve as a lightning rod.Â  Â Even before the IMF existed, long periods of autarky and hardship accompanied debt crises.Â  Now let us turn to the substance. The events of the past few weeks do not change basic facts and fundamentals.Â  Krugman has responded in a much shorter post, not taking on nearly the whole letter, identifying what he sees and Reinhart and Rogoff's key sin: There is, as everyone in this debate has acknowledged, a negative correlation in the data between debt and growth. As a result, draw a line at any point â€” 80 percent, 90 percent, whatever â€” and countries with debt above that level will tend to have slower growth than countries with debt below that level. There is, however, an enormous difference between the statement â€œcountries with debt over 90 percent of GDP tend to have slower growth than countries with debt below 90 percent of GDPâ€ and the statement â€œgrowth drops off sharply when debt exceeds 90 percent of GDPâ€. The former statement is true; the latter isnâ€™t. Yet R&amp;R have repeatedly blurred that distinction, and have continued to do so in recent writings. Read Paul's full post here &gt; And read Reinhart &amp; Rogoff's full post here &gt;
REUTERS/Michael MacSweeneyApple's office in Cork.SAN FRANCISCO/DUBLINÂ (Reuters) -Â AppleÂ has operated almost tax-free inÂ IrelandÂ since 1980, welcomed by a government keen to bring jobs to what was then one ofÂ Europe's poorest countries, former company executives and Irish officials have said. Chief Executive Tim Cook faced criticism from aÂ Senate subcommittee in WashingtonÂ on Tuesday over theÂ iPadÂ andÂ iPhoneÂ maker's tax practices, which had been shrouded from full view behind secretive tax-exempt Irish-based corporate entities. Apple, one ofÂ Ireland's top multinational employers, denied avoiding billions of dollars in U.S. taxes and said its arrangements helped fund research jobs in theÂ United States. The committee revealed thatÂ Apple's Irish companies, some of which are not tax resident in any jurisdiction, allowed the group to pay no tax on much of its overseas earnings in recent years. SenatorÂ Carl Levin, chairman of the subcommittee, saidÂ AppleÂ had sought "the Holy Grail of tax avoidance". A former company executive and Irish officials told Reuters the almost tax-free status dates all the way back toÂ Apple's arrival in County Cork 32 years ago. AppleÂ must have seemed attractive toÂ IrelandÂ and to Cork. Amid a generally moribund Irish economy, Cork had been hard hit by the closure of its shipyards and a Ford car plant, and in 1986 nearly one in four were out of work in the city. In the early days,Â Apple's staff sat down to meals together. Now the company employs 4,000 inÂ Ireland. "There were tax concessions for us to go there," said DelÂ Yocam, who was Vice President of manufacturing atÂ AppleÂ in the early 1980s. "It was a big concession." In fact, the deal was about as good as a company can get. "We had a tax holiday for the first 10 years inÂ Ireland. We paid no taxes to theÂ Irish government," one former finance executive, who asked not to be named, said. AppleÂ wasn't an exception, although it was among the last to enjoy such favorable treatment. From 1956 to 1980,Â IrelandÂ attracted foreign companies by offering a zero rate of tax, according to theÂ Irish government's website. Eligible companies arriving in 1980 were given holidays until 1990. "Any multinational attracted intoÂ IrelandÂ that was focusing on the export market paid zero percent corporation tax," saidÂ Barry O'Leary, CEO ofÂ IDA Ireland, which is charged with attracting investment intoÂ Ireland. AppleÂ said it pays all the tax due in every country where it operates. It declined to comment on the tax treatment it received in the 1980s. As part ofÂ Ireland's accession to theÂ European Economic Community, precursor to theÂ European Union, in 1973, it was forced to stop offering tax holidays to exporters. From 1981, companies arriving inÂ IrelandÂ had to pay tax, albeit at a low 10 percent rate, providing they qualified for manufacturing status. ECONOMIC COUP Apple's investment was a major coup forÂ Ireland. At the time, the country was struggling with high and rising unemployment, double-digit inflation and a brain drain of the young and educated through emigration. "We were the first technology company to establish a manufacturing operation inÂ Ireland," recalledÂ John Sculley,Â Apple's CEO from 1983 to 1993. He said government subsidies had also played a role in deciding to set up a base inÂ Ireland. IrelandÂ also offered low wage rates - a big attraction when it came to hiring hundreds of people for the relatively low-skilled work of assembling electronic equipment. AppleÂ told the subcommittee it could not answer questions about why it choseÂ IrelandÂ as a base since it had lost the paperwork from the period. The operation in Cork built the company'sÂ AppleÂ II computer and would later build disc drives, â€˜Mac' computers and others. These would be sold inÂ Europe, theÂ Middle East,Â AfricaÂ andÂ Asia. But having a tax holiday inÂ IrelandÂ would not, in itself, have allowedÂ AppleÂ to operate tax free in these markets. Equipment assembly is not the kind of activity that economists or tax authorities usually credit with generating a large share of a technology company's profits. More value has been associated with generating the intellectual property behind the technology - whichÂ AppleÂ did in theÂ United StatesÂ - and with the selling of goods, which was to be done on the ground inÂ France, Britain andÂ India. But none of these countries offered the tax advantagesÂ IrelandÂ did. The key to minimizingÂ Apple's tax bill was maximizing the amount of profit that could be ascribed toÂ Apple's Irish operations. THE ARCHITECT This task fell toÂ Mike Rashkin,Â Apple's first tax director, two executives from the period said. One called him "the father of it all". Rashkin arrived atÂ AppleÂ in 1980, from computer pioneer Digital Equipment Corp (DEC) inÂ Massachusetts, where he had learnt about tax-efficient corporate structuring in tech companies. AppleÂ had already decided to establish its base inÂ IrelandÂ when Rashkin moved to Silicon Valley, but he used his experience at DEC to set up a tax structure that took advantage ofÂ Apple's base in the country, the executives said. Rashkin declined to comment. TheÂ SenateÂ subcommittee's report reveals how the arrangement was structured. In 1980,Â AppleÂ entered into a deal with its Irish operation, whereby the latter would share the cost of fundingÂ Apple's research and development. In return, the Irish unit would be able to enjoy rights toÂ Apple's intellectual property for goods sold outside theÂ Americas. AppleÂ secured the blessing of the U.S. tax authority, theÂ Internal Revenue Service, for the deal, one executive said. The IRS gaveÂ AppleÂ an advance pricing agreement, or APA, an agreement which establishes how the IRS will treat a transaction between affiliates for tax purposes, before it is entered into. Many countries' tax authorities offer APAs, and companies say they are necessary to facilitate international trade and investment. Tax campaigners say tax authorities have been too ready to accept the pricing proposed by companies which apply for APAs. The New York TimesÂ reported last year thatÂ Apple's low taxes were at least in part due to the confidential technology transfer arrangement. The terms of the deal and subsequent cost-sharing deals were favorable forÂ Apple's Irish unit. In effect, the Irish unit paid much less to its U.S. parent for the use ofÂ AppleÂ intellectual property than it made from selling that property on to affiliates. "Apple's cost sharing agreement (CSA) with its offshore affiliates inÂ IrelandÂ is primarily a conduit for shifting billions of dollars in income from theÂ United StatesÂ to a low tax jurisdiction," the subcommittee's report said. Meanwhile,Â AppleÂ also constructed a system whereby the affiliates which were actually selling the finished equipment would earn minimal profits. The techniquesÂ AppleÂ used over the years included selling goods to affiliates at prices which generated little profit at the retail level, or by paying sales affiliates commissions which are just about enough to cover their operating costs. Rashkin's work andÂ Ireland's accommodating approach had the desired result forÂ Apple. "We're very, very pleased,"Â Apple's then-President A.C. â€˜Mike' Markulla said in 1981. "The Irish have really lived up to their promises." Indeed, the accounts forÂ Apple's main Irish unit, then known asÂ AppleÂ Computer Inc. Ltd, for 1989, the earliest year for which detailed accounts were filed, show exactly how effective the arrangement was. The subsidiary paid $500,000 in income tax on profits of $317 million, a rate of 0.2 percent. END OF THE HOLIDAY In 1990,Â Apple's tax holiday came to an end, and in that year, the Irish operation's tax rate hit 4 percent, accounts from the period show. At the same time,Â Apple's Irish manufacturing activities came under question as the company looked to cut costs by outsourcing. In 1992, the company announced plans to cut hundreds of jobs after deciding to shift some work toÂ Singapore, which at this time was attracting increasing investment by offering tax holidays. "They nearly leftÂ IrelandÂ altogether," O'Leary said. By this stage, the European Community had banned tax holidays of the kind given toÂ Apple, so the company andÂ DublinÂ negotiated an arrangement which had a similar outcome but fell within European rules. The precise details of the arrangement were not disclosed, but Phillip Bullock,Â Apple's head of tax operations, indicated that it was linked to minimizing taxable profit. "Since the early 1990s, theÂ Government of IrelandÂ has calculatedÂ Apple's taxable income in such a way as to produce an effective rate in the low single digits," he told the subcommittee. The deal didn't stopÂ AppleÂ from shifting manufacturing work toÂ Asia, but in the years that followed new jobs were created in Cork, in sales and administrative support for the European operation, the accounts of the Irish units show. Some manufacturing remains inÂ Ireland, the subcommittee said. AnÂ Irish governmentÂ spokesman declined to even confirm it held discussions withÂ AppleÂ regarding tax, citing rules on taxpayer confidentiality. From 1996Â IrelandÂ phased in a 12.5 percent tax on all corporate trading income, although foreign companies often pay effective rates lower than this by shifting money into tax havens such asÂ Bermuda.

REUTERS/Ralph OrlowskiFRANKFURT, May 25 - An Austrian man tip-toed along a line strung 185 meters (607 feet) off the ground in Frankfurt on Saturday, attempting to set a new world record for "highlining" despite his fear of heights. Reinhard Kleindl, 32, used only his arms to balance as he walked twice along a 30-metre-long polyester rope anchored to the two wings of Frankfurt's U-shaped skyscraper Tower 185 above hundreds of cheering supporters. Kleindl said he was trying to set a new record for walking the highest urban highline, but no one was immediately available from the World Slackline Federation to confirm if this was a new record. According to Kleindl, the previous record was set by a group of French adrenaline junkies on a line about 120 meters above the ground, between the Les Mercuriales twin towers in Paris, two years ago. Unlike tightropes, slacklines are not held rigidly taut, making it harder to balance. After completing his walks, Kleindl whooped with joy and admitted he was a bit afraid of heights. "The effect of the height was worse than I had expected. The straight lines of the building just seem to drop down into infinity," said the long-haired and bearded Austrian. Kleindl, who studied particle physics before becoming a professional slackliner, was due to repeat his walk three times during a two-day skyscraper-themed festival that started on Saturday.

REUTERS/Tony GentileROME (Reuters) - Pope Francis spoke out against mafia organizations exploiting and enslaving people, calling on mafiosi on Sunday to repent in words that recalled an impassioned plea by Pope John Paul II 20 years ago. Speaking off the cuff after his weekly Angelus blessing in St. Peter's Square, Francis spoke about the mafia for the first time since he became pontiff two months ago. High profile killings by the Italian mafia have declined since the 1990s, but through activities such as prostitution, extortion and drug trafficking they still wield a heavy influence over the country and its economy. Italy's main crime groups - the Sicilian Cosa Nostra, the Calabrian 'Ndrangheta and the Camorra from around the southern city of Naples - have a joint annual turnover of 116 billion euros ($150 billion), according to the United Nations. That is more than the annual sales of Italy's biggest company, oil giant Eni. Francis recalled the example of the Sicilian anti-mafia priest Giuseppe Puglisi, who was killed by gunmen in 1993 outside his home in the island's capital of Palermo, and was beatified on Saturday . "My thoughts are with the suffering of women, men and also children who are exploited by the many mafias who make them slaves, through prostitution, through many social pressures," he said. "They cannot do this, they cannot make our brothers slaves, we must pray to the Lord to make these mafiosi convert to God." In one of his most famous addresses in Agrigento, Sicily, in May 1993, John Paul angrily called on mafiosi to "repent, because one day you will face the judgment of God". Earlier, Francis made his first visit to a Rome parish when he said Mass outside a church in the northern fringe of the city, joking with local children during the service. "You can understand reality better from the outskirts than the center," he said in front of the modern, red brick church of Saints Elisabeth and Zachariah, a far cry from the vast 16th century Basilica of St. Peters in the Vatican. During the service the pope, who is bishop of Rome, held a light-hearted question and answer session with children about the roles of God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit. "Whoever gets it right will win the derby," he said, in a reference to the Italian soccer cup final to be played later between Rome's two rival teams, AS Roma and Lazio.

The Mother Of All Painted-In Corners Alice laughed: "There's no use trying," she said; "one can't believe impossible things." "I daresay you haven't had much practice," said the Queen. "When I was younger, I always did it for half an hour a day. Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast." â€“ Alice in Wonderland,Â Lewis Carroll I wrote several years ago that Japan is a bug in search of a windshield. And in January I wrote that 2013 is the Year of the Windshield. The recent volatility in Japanese markets is breathtaking but characteristic of what one should come to expect from a country that is on the brink of fiscal and economic disaster. I don't mean to be trite, from a global perspective; Japan is not Greece: Japan is the third-largest economy in the world. Its biggest banks are on a par with those of the US. It is a global power in trade and trade finance. Its currency has reserve status. It has two of the worldâ€™s six largest corporations and 71 of the largest 500, surpassed only by the US and comfortably ahead of China, with 46. Even with the rest of Asia's big companies combined with China's, the total barely surpasses Japan's (CNN). In short, when Japan embarks on a very risky fiscal and monetary strategy, it delivers a serious impact on the rest of the world. And doubly so because global growth is now driven by Asia. Japan has fired the first real shot in what future historians will record as the most significant global currency war since the 1930s and the first in a world dominated by true fiat money. At the risk of glossing over details, I am going to try and summarize the problems of Japan in a single letter. First, a summary of the summary: Japan has painted itself into the mother all corners. There will be no clean or easy exit. There is going to be massive economic pain as they the Japanese try and find a way out of their problems, and sadly, the pain will not be confined to Japan. This will be the true test of the theories of neo-Keynesianism writ large. Japan is going to print and monetize and spend more than almost any observer can currently imagine. You like what Paul Krugman prescribes? You think he makes sense? You (we all!) are going to be participants in a real-world experiment on how that works out.Â  (Note: This letter will print longer than usual as there are a lot of graphs.) But first, I want to mention a very special event, that is of great relevance to this discussion, and that will be coming your way in just a couple weeks. I'm going to get together in New York with five of the most powerful investing minds in the world â€“ Kyle Bass, Mohamed El-Erian, John Hussman, Barry Ritholtz, and David Rosenberg â€“ and we're going to totally take apart the New Normal environment in which we all find ourselves and then rethink and rebuild it in a way that will help you not only survive it but profit from it.Â Investing In the New NormalÂ will feature a full hour of our unfiltered conversation and uncensored analysis. It will come to a computer screen near you onÂ Tuesday, June 11, and you will want to be there! The event is free, andÂ you can register here. Seriously, a full hour with those five guys. How cool is that? I will make sure you get a few powerful take-away s that will impact your thinking and your investing. And now, letâ€™s take a look at that hard windshield and that big bug. The Mother of All Painted-In Corners In no particular order, letâ€™s look at some facets of the daunting task facing Prime Minister Abe and the country of Japan. After the collapse of what might still be the largest economic bubble in history, in 1989, Japan is still mired in a 24-year non-recovery. Nominal GDP in 2011 was almost exactly what it was 20 years earlier, in 1991 (MeasuringWorth.com). You can find other ways to measure nominal GDP which indicate limited growth; but compared to the US and China, nominal growth in Japan has been paltry.  (Google Public Data Explorer) That lack of growth takes on special importance because when we measure national debt-to-GDP we use nominal GDP as the denominator. If debt is growing and the economy is not, that debt-to-GDP ratio can grow very rapidly. From theÂ Financial TimesÂ at the end of March: Japanâ€™s central bank governor has told parliament that the governmentâ€™s vast and growing debt is "not sustainable," and that a loss of confidence in state finances could â€œhave a very negative impactâ€ on the entire economy. The warning comes as Shinzo Abeâ€™s administration attempts to drag Japan out of more than a decade of deflation with aggressive monetary and fiscal stimulus. In January, weeks after taking office, the government unveiled a Y10.3tn ($109bn) spending package while leaning on the Bank of Japan to buy more of its bonds â€“ a strategy described by Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities as "print and spend". Speaking to lawmakersÂ on Thursday, BoJ governor Haruhiko Kuroda noted that, while the government bond market has been "stable," Japanâ€™s gross debt to GDP ratio â€“ expected to top 245 per cent this year, according to estimates by the International Monetary Fund â€“ is "extremely high" and "abnormal". Japanese households and corporations are saving even as the government runs deficits close to 10%. As a way to compare, a 10% deficit in the US would be $1.6 trillion.  Damn the Torpedoes, Full Speed Ahead! There are two and only two ways to grow an economy in real terms. You can grow your working population, or you can increase your productivity. Thatâ€™s it. Japan does not have the option of growing its population (or has not chosen to), and it is actually quite difficult for an industrial economy to grow its productivity. If your population is actually shrinking (see chart below) and productivity growth is less than 1%, then real GDP growth is just not possible. We are going to revisit this uncomfortable fact later.   (ChinaGlobeTrade.com) Japan ran a massive trade surplus for years. Now it is running a large trade deficit. If you run a trade deficit and a fiscal deficit, either private savings has to make up the difference, or the central bank has to print massive amounts of money. That is an accounting identity; there are no other choices. Absent massive monetization, you suck all the available investment capital from your private economy. But Japan needs growth to get out of its fiscal and economic morass. That means it desperately needs more exports, since its aging population cannot be the source of significant increases in consumer spending. The Japanese elderly are savers and hoarders, almost by definition.  The Abe government and the Bank of Japan under Kuroda-san have targeted 2% inflation. Even with nominal GDP growth last quarter of 3.6% (annualized), the country was in deflation. They have been trying to generate inflation for 24 years. How will they now get 2% inflation? One way is to increase the cost of their imports. The problem is that Japan imports only about 16% of its GDP, according to recent World Bank data. That means to get to 2% inflation they would need their currency to drop by about 15-20% a year (as the effects are not one-to-one, but that takes a whole letter to explain). Easy enough: the yen has fallen that much since just the beginning of this year (see chart below). The problem is that you have to do thatÂ everyÂ year, on a trade-weighted basis, with all your trading partners. This chart shows the fall of the yen against the US dollar. The yen closed around 101 today, from 75 less than a year ago. So mission accomplished, right?  Well, not so fast. Japan trades with the world, and what matters is the trade-weighted yen (just as the trade-weighted dollar is what makes the difference in the trade balance of the US). And while the trade-weighted yen is down over 20% against the average of the currencies of Japan's key trading partners, that is not as much as it is down against the dollar (see chart below). Australia and other Asian countries are just beginning to respond to Japan by lowering exchange rates and by other means, so the â€œeasyâ€ devaluation of the yen has already happened. The hard work is just starting, as other countries will increasingly feel forced to respond. No major country can export its deflation to the rest of the world without the rest of the world seeking to redress the balance.  For Japan to get that 15-20% a year currency depreciation for the next five years would be such a tectonic-plate shift for the world that it is difficult to express the magnitude of the task. That would put the yen at 200 to the dollar by 2018 or sooner. If you are Germany, can you deal with that? Korea? China? Â It will not be long before you can buy a Lexus cheaper than you can buy a Hyundai, and a Panasonic flat screen will be half the price of a Samsung or LG. But of course Japan does not act in a vacuum. As I wrote last week, Let's put the recent drop in the yen in context. TheÂ Nihon Keizai Shimbun,Â the main Japanese business newspaper, has reported that every one-yen fall in the yen/dollar rate will translate into a $2.7 BILLION increase in profits for the 30 largest Japanese exporters.  For every one yen the currency drops in value against the dollar, Toyota estimates that its profits will increase by $340 million. PER ONE-YEN DROP! Toyota reported $3.33 billion in profits last quarter, so that additional $340 million of profit per one-yen fall could send its second-half profits â€“ and its stock â€“ to the moon. But those profits donâ€™t just magically appear; they come from sales. Sales that are in large part due to better terms of trade and lower costs. Those profits are from sales that might have gone to other companies based in other countries and that might have been valued in euros, dollars, yuan, or won. Which is why businesses and finance ministers all over the world are not happy with Japan. Six Impossible Things Abe and Japan are in an almost ridiculously impossible situation. Letâ€™s look at what they have to do in the light of what we just read. They cannot continue to grow their debt at the current rate. There is a limit. No one knows for sure what that is, but it is getting closer. And they know it. So they have to get their fiscal deficit below the growth rate of nominal GDP. To do that they have to have both real growth and nominal growth. Real growth in a country with a shrinking population requires productivity increases on a scale not seen in any industrial country anywhere for any sustained period of time. So they have to get nominal growth, which means they absolutely must have inflation or their country will collapse in a massive debt deflation, with skyrocketing interest rates. But 2% inflation implies that interest rates on Japanese bonds must be at least 2% if not 3% or more. That is double what they are now after the recent spike in the yield of JGBs (Japanese government bonds) from 0.5% to 1%, which sent the Japanese stock market into a tailspinÂ on ThursdayÂ â€“ down 7.3 percent. As Kyle Bass and others have amply demonstrated, if JGB interest rates rise 2% in Japan, then the government must pay almost 80% of its revenues (as currently received) just to cover the interest on its debt. That is, of course, not a viable business model. Even a 1% rise would be fiscally devastating. The Abe government plans to raise taxes. Japanâ€™s current sales tax is 5%,Â due to increase to 8% next year and 10% by 2015, although they will look at economic data in October to decide whether taxes will indeed rise. That is a large tax increase, and it will, of course, hurt consumer spending. But the government has to reduce its fiscal deficit at some point. The question is when and how. For two decades the answer has been "Next year." Next year may actually arrive ahead of time if the bond market starts to get nervous. Look at the drop in 10-year JGB bond prices this week (throughÂ Thursday, hat tipÂ The King Report).While such drops have happened in the recent past, you can be sure this is cause for concern in Tokyo. There are limits, even for Japan, to what bond investors will endure.  Reducing fiscal spending will by definition (an accounting identity again) reduce GDP or at the very least make it more difficult to attain inflation of 2%. Remember, austerity is not a punishment but a consequence of past failures to control spending. Unwarranted Humility The solution that Abe and Kuroda arrived at, to the applause of mainstream economists, is massive quantitative easing. Letâ€™s look at a paper just published by UC Berkeley Professor Christina Romer, former chairwoman of the Presidentâ€™s Council of Economic Advisors. (Hat tip Barry Ritholtz atÂ The Big Picture.) I will summarize, but you can read the paperhere. Basically, Romer (with a nod to Krugman, et al.) suggests that Abe and Kuroda have initiated what she calls a regime shift and that "it just might work." And then she proceeds to compare what Japan is doing to the policies of Roosevelt in the early '30s. Quoting from the introduction: Last week, we witnessed one of the most exciting developments in monetary policymaking since the 1930s. The Japanese central bank staged an honest-to-goodness regime shift. The Bank of Japan went beyond vague promises and cheap talk. As I will describe in more detail later, it took dramatic actions and pledged convincingly to do whatever it takes to end deflation in Japan. The theoretical reasons why this regime shift may be important are well understood by economists. Persistent deflation and anemic growth suggest that Japan continues to suffer from a shortfall of demand. But their policy interest rate is already at the zero lower bound. Furthermore, riskier, long-term rates are also very low â€“ suggesting that unconventional policies such as large-scale asset purchases are unlikely to do much to further reduce nominal rates. As discussed by Paul Krugman, Gauti Eggertsson and Michael Woodford, and others, if unconventional monetary policy can raise expected infl ation, this can push down real interest rates even though nominal rates cannot fall. This, in turn, can raise aggregate demand by stimulating interest-sensitive spending. And in the conclusion she suggests that bold policies must be aggressively pursued: In a recent paper, David Romer and I discuss that such views are potentially veryÂ destructive. We show that what are widely viewed as the two largest errors in Federal Reserve history â€“ inaction in the wake of banking panics early in the Depression, and inaction in the face of high and rising inflation in the 1970s â€“ were both borne ofÂ unwarranted humility. Fear that policies might not work or might be costly led policymakers to conclude that the prudent thing was to do nothing. Yet there is nowÂ widespread consensus that action would have been effective in both these periods. We have nothing to fear but fear itself: this is the heart of Keynesian thinking. And if it is good for Japan then what of the rest of the world? Earlier in the paper, Romer writes, after discussing recent US Federal Reserve policy actions: But the truth is even these moves were pretty small steps. With its most recent action, the Fed has pushed the edges of its current regime. And I am sure that given the opposition in Congress and the difference of opinion within the FOMC, even those measures were a struggle. Nevertheless, the key fact remains that the Fed has been unwilling to do a regime shift. And because of that, monetary policy has not been able to play a decisive role in generating recovery. To paraphrase E. Cary Brown's famous conclusion about fiscal policy in the Great Depression: monetary policy has not been a strong recovery tool in recent years not because it did not work but because it was not tried â€“ at least not on the scale and in the form that was necessary to have a large impact. Wow. Double wow. Breath-taking triple wow. Read this paper. Absorb it. And then bookmark it and come back in five years. I give Romer this: she shows no unwarranted humility in this paper. She goes â€œall inâ€ in backing this Japanese policy. But I do agree with Professor Romer about one thing: this is the most serious and radical economic experiment undertaken in my lifetime by a major economic power. And the rest of the world must pay attention. If this has succeeded in working five years from now, if Japan is growing and its debt relative to GDP is shrinking and the rest of the world has allowed the yen to drop in half, then let me state here and now that I will have to rethink my understanding of economics. But ironically, if I were Abe and faced with the question, â€œWhat do I do now with what I have inherited,â€ I am not sure that I could do anything else. He is a politician and a Japanese one at that. The Japanese are serious hometown players, as are the citizens of most countries. You do what is best for your hometown and don't worry about the neighbors all that much. You want to stay friends, but your first responsibility is the hometown.Â  If you're Abe, what are your choices? They are nothing but ugly. Perhaps the best of a very, very ugly-bad lot is that you have to try and inflate away that debt. Monetize as much as you can and then just â€œpoofâ€ it away. You destroy your currency in the process, but you have to destroy something. And maybe your derring do gives your exporters a boost and a competitive advantage, so you at least salvage that. Why not export your deflation? And then gamble that maybe Romer and Krugman are right. It could work! Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead! There Is No Turning Back Now, some investing consequences. Let me repeat what I wrote months ago, that the largest single position in my personal portfolio, sinceÂ January 1, is short Japan. Let me clarify that, as I am not short Japanese companies or businesses but rather short Japanese government economic policies. (I am executing that trade primarily through hedge funds, although there are ways to explore that trade in a more conventional manner.) I think the yen will still be under pressure for some time (this is a long-term trade) and that Japanese interest rates will be under pressure. But do NOT run out and short JGBs (see below)! First, let me agree with Joyce Poon of GaveKal, commenting on the recent violent moves in the financial markets in Japan (which echoes what I heard from Louis Gave at my conference): No doubt many investors are wondering if this is the first hint that the emperor in fact has no clothes â€“ that Abenomics is just a flash in the pan. We think it is just a reminder that riding a bull is never smooth; surely more market drawdowns lie ahead. But as Anatole recently wrote in TheÂ Arithmetic Of Abenomics, the fiscal and monetary expansion already implemented has been so extreme that there is no turning back from Abenomics. Unless Japan can achieve much faster economic growth, Prime Minister Shinzo Abeâ€™s radical experiment with macroeconomic stimulus will create a debt and monetary overhang so huge that it will bankrupt the financial system and quite possibly trigger hyper-inflation. This is why Abeâ€™s radical reforms will go forward, and in time aggressive monetary policy will be need to be backed up by larger structural reforms. This brings us to a second, and potentially more dangerous, type of volatility in Japan: in JGBs. With Japanese banks holding huge JGB portfolios, a sharp rise in yields would generate capital losses. Indeed, according to the Bank of Japan, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would lead to mark-to-market losses of 20% of Tier 1 capital for regional banks and 10% for the major banks. As banks play a key role in the transmission mechanism in quantitative easing and reflationary economics, a damaged bank balance sheet can significantly reduce the effectiveness of Abenomics. One problem is that the BoJâ€™s purchase operation is also crowding out other players in the JGB market, and this amplifies interest rate volatility. The reduction in JGB liquidity means that financial institutions are finding it difficult to quickly find counterparties to buy or sell large volumes of the bonds. The risk is that higher interest rate volatility could in turn induce further JGB sell-offs, completing a vicious circle of capital destruction for the banks.Â Â Â Â Â Â  To prevent a catastrophic crash of the JGB market, more BoJ action is needed. This is likely to include increased flexibility in liquidity injections, a broader range of purchase tactics and better verbal communication with the market. But shrinking liquidity, higher volatility, and even potential spillovers from rising yields globally, could continue to put upward pressure on JGB yields. This doesnâ€™t mean the Japan bull market is over. But as we argued in our latestÂ Five Corners, remain hedged! Let me repeat the most important sentences, with which I totally agree: â€¦ as Anatole recently wrote in TheÂ Arithmetic Of Abenomics, the fiscal and monetary expansion already implemented has been so extreme that there is no turning back from Abenomics. Unless Japan can achieve much faster economic growth, Prime Minister Shinzo Abeâ€™s radical experiment with macroeconomic stimulus will create a debt and monetary overhang so huge that it will bankrupt the financial system and quite possibly trigger hyper-inflation. This is why Abeâ€™s radical reforms will go forward, and in time aggressive monetary policy will be need to be backed up by larger structural reforms. The government of Japan has no choice. They are painting themselves into the Mother of All Painted-In Corners, yet they must continue to paint or collapse. They have fired the first shot in what will be the firstÂ realÂ currency war of our lives, not the little sandbox versions we have experienced so far. There is NO historical analogy. None. The last major currency war, in the 1930s, happened when the world was largely on a gold standard. We now live in a world awash in fiat currency. Can Europe sit by and watch the yen fall 50% from where it is today? Will Germany allow it? What will China do? If they respond in kind, they risk inflation. If they donâ€™t, they risk losing export sales and jobs. Malaysia is on a borrowing binge to finance its real estate growth. Indonesia? And Korea certainly canâ€™t sit idle and watch its chaibols (the Korean version of the Japanese keiretsu) get hammered, can it? For a time, then, major central banks are going to have to sit on their hands and do nothing, as they canâ€™t stop printing or using monetary policy to improve their internal economic dynamics. Japan is in reality just catching up in terms of quantitative easing,Â as I showed last week. Japan intends to export its deflation. And with the approval of the economic cognoscenti, it is going to do so in a manner and to an extent that the world has never experienced before. The old saw of â€œin for a dime, in for a dollarâ€ will be the rule of the day. Japan cannot back down without suffering massive financial upheaval. I think they are likely to suffer no matter what they do, but this is the path to suffering they have chosen. So be it. All we can do is try and stay off the dance floor when the elephants are dancing. Or find a really good dance partner who knows the moves and follow! This will not be an environment in which to take dancing lessons. The Arthur Murray Dance School does not know the steps that will be in vogue at this party. I canâ€™t with any reasonable certainty tell you how all this will play out, as we are simply in uncharted territory. But I do know I want to own assets that central banks canâ€™t print. Their actions will affect those assets, to be sure â€“ we are going to see more volatility than we would like. But that creates opportunity. Of course, we are going to continue to look at the implications of these developments in future letters. In closing, this is the last call to register for the upcoming webinar with my good friends Kyle Bass and Altegris President and CEO Jon Sundt. Kyle will just be back from Japan, where he has been talking with leaders, and I will be in Brussels, trying to get a view on all this from some of their leaders. I can tell you that I have never had a dull conversation with Kyle! While we are sure to discuss Japan and the yen, we will also focus in depth on a new fund Kyle manages that was recently added to the Altegris platform. Please join us thisWednesday, May 29. If you are a qualified purchaser or a licensed investment adviser qualified to make private placement recommendations, be sure toÂ register hereÂ for this event. Upon qualification by my partners at Altegris,Â you will receive an email invitation.Â If you are already an existing Mauldin Circle member, you will receive a separate email invitation to register for the event. I apologize for limiting this discussion to qualified purchasers and investment advisors, but we must follow the rules and regulations.Â I look forward to having you at this exclusive Mauldin Circle event.Â (In this regard, I am president and a registered representative of Millennium Wave Securities, LLC, member FINRA and SIPC.)  Brussels, Washington, DC, NYC, Monaco, and Home? I am probably on a plane to Brussels as you read this, where I will be with Geert Wellens and his team at Econopolis. They have a fascinating few days lined up for me, and I expect to learn a lot as well. The schedule looks to be quite enjoyable. Then I am home for a few days before I head off to DC to meet with Newt Gingrich and tape a video or two, in which we will talk about our favorite topic, the positive transformation of society that is happening because of technology. Pat Cox will join us. I also have a few other meetings lined up there, and then I'll take a train with John Hussman to NYC to do the video webinar I mentioned at the beginning of the letter. Then I return home for a few weeks and enjoy Fatherâ€™s Day before heading off to Monaco to speak at the GAIM conference (June 17-19). They have a nice line-up of speakers, and I get to meet with Nassim Taleb. I really do intend to review his new and very important book,Â Antifragility,Â at some point. If you qualify as an investor, you can attend for free by clicking onÂ 19th Annual GAIM International 2013.

Finally, I will go to Cyprus, where I am hoping to meet with people who can give me insights into what is going on there. If you are in Cyprus the weekend ofÂ June 22-23, drop me a note. I am still homeless and living in a hotel but getting closer to actually closing (or so they tell me) on my new apartments. I hope by the time I get back from Brussels everything will be ready to close. I have leased a small place in the same building to live in while my two apartments are combined into one. Construction will take 3-4 months. I am so ready to move. I am used to hotels, but not having access to my â€œstuffâ€ is getting old, and the internet here is so slow it is driving me to distraction. It is late and time to hit the send button. Have a great week! Your looking forward to a better hotel in Brussels analyst, John Mauldinsubscribers@MauldinEconomics.com Copyright 2013 John Mauldin.

en.wikipedia.orgTWO IRISH FILMMAKERS want to know if thorium could be the answer to the worldâ€™s energy woes â€“ and they haveÂ launched a Kickstarter campaignÂ to raise enough money to finish a documentary on the topic. Frankie Fenton and Des Kelleher want to raise Â£40,000 ($51,640) so that they can finish post-production on The Good Reactor, their documentary looking into the alternative nuclear fuel and whether it can generate clean, safe energy. Documentary They spent two years travelling around Europe and North America interviewing people on both sides of the debate for their documentary.  Fenton toldÂ TheJournal.ieÂ that all the funds raised will go exclusively into finishing the film, and they plan to work with professionals including animators, an editor, and distributors, as well as purchase stock footage. Fenton said that when he was told by a friend about â€œthis nuclear energy that could solve all the problems of the worldâ€™s energy crisisâ€, he didnâ€™t believe him. When he investigated thorium himself, he became very interested and then started down the road of interviewing experts on the topic. He spoke to thorium expert Kirk Sorenson about the issue, which was the first interview for the documentary. I didnâ€™t know if this was real or not â€“ I kept on asking as many people as possible about it. If this stuff is true, whatâ€™s the story? As well as those championing thorium, he spoke to thorium sceptics. The aim of the documentary is to have it as well-produced as possible, so that it can get out to a wide audience and spark a discussion about thorium. Thorium is a radioactive chemical element which isÂ more widely available than the uraniumÂ that powers nuclear plants, and as the Guardian explains, its proponents say that it could be used to generate large amounts of low-carbon electricity. It has a number of benefits compared to uranium, as it is seen as safer with less potential for nuclear disaster; it is far more difficult to use its byproducts for making nuclear weapons and the waste it generates is not as dangerous for as long as uranium waste is. The reactors that generate energy from thorium could burn up existing nuclear waste, said Fenton.  â€œWe really just want people to talk about it. If this stuff isnâ€™t true thatâ€™s absolutely fine,â€ said Fenton, adding their aim is to start a discussion or debate around the issue. A UK government report last September said that the benefits of thorium have been â€œoverstated,â€Â Â the Guardian reported. It said that it has â€œtheoretical advantagesâ€ but â€œwhile there is some justification for these benefits, they are often overstatedâ€. Fenton believes there is a â€œmassive audienceâ€ for this subject, especially in the United States, and that â€œthe actual subject matter appeals to more than one category of peopleâ€, as â€œclimate change is in the news every dayâ€. We think itâ€™s a really important film that needs to be made and the people need to know about. â€œI could just make a terrible YouTube film but it would be a shame if that did happen. I think there is a really good story in it and very strong characters in it,â€ concluded Fenton. It is hoped that when the film is completed it will be shown in film festivals and distributed worldwide.
Kevork Djansezian/Getty ImagesTHE CALIFORNIAN One Friday morning this spring, I drove to Washingtonâ€™s Dulles airport at dawn, to catch the first nonstop flight to San Francisco. When I got off the plane six hours later, the morning sun still slanting through the terminal windows, my cellphone began ringing practically as soon as I turned it on. â€œOkay, youâ€™re here!â€ the man on the other end of the call said, cheerily. Iâ€™d been trying to arrange a visit to his office for quite a while, and just the previous evening heâ€™d let me know that if I got there in a hurry, heâ€™d have time to talk the next day, as well as over the weekend. As I walked through the airport, he began reeling off turn-by-turn instructions for reaching his office in Oakland in my rental car. â€œYouâ€™ll take the Bay Bridge to the exit for the 580 East and the 24. But donâ€™t go all the way to the 24! That would send you out to Concord. Take the 980 West until the exit for 27th Street, and then â€¦â€ It was like a moment from aÂ Saturday Night LiveÂ sketch of â€œThe Californiansâ€â€”Â­which seemed appropriate, since the man I was talking with was theÂ Californian, Jerry Brown. Brown began his first two terms as governor in 1974, at age 36, following one Republican former actor, Ronald Reagan. He returned to the office at age 72, following another, Arnold Schwarzenegger. In between he ran for president three times and the U.S. Senate once, all of course unsuccessfully; served eight years as Oaklandâ€™s mayor and four as Californiaâ€™s attorney general; and lived in both Japan (studying Zen meditation) and India (volunteering for Mother Teresa). He celebrated his 75th birthday the weekend I was in Oakland, which means that if he runs for reelection next year and if he wins, both of which are considered likelyâ€”his approval rating this year has been the envy of other politicians in the stateâ€”he could still be governor at age 80. â€œThis is certainly a new identity for Brown, so flighty in his first â€˜Governor Moonbeamâ€™ period as governor,â€ Bruce Cain, a political scientist and an expert on California politics at Stanfordâ€™s Bill Lane Center for the American West, told me. â€œNow he is the most trusted, stable, and reliable leader around.â€ I asked Kevin Starr, of the University of Southern California and the author of the acclaimed Americans and the California Dream series of books, how Brown was seen in his return to office. â€œHe is now liked,â€ Starr said. â€œEccentric, but liked.â€ Life and health are provisional, and within the past two years, Brown has undergone radiation treatment for early-stage prostate cancer (while maintaining his normal work schedule) and had a cancerous growth removed from his nose. But he moves, talks, reacts, and laughs like someone who is in no mood, and feels no need, to slow down. He is nearly a decade older than Bill Clinton but comes across as younger and bouncier. â€œIÂ loveÂ what I am doing,â€ he told me once I got to his Oakland office. â€œI love it much more than the first time. Back then I got bored because we didnâ€™t have big problems. Now I am very enthusiastic. Everythingâ€™s interesting, and itâ€™s complicated. There is aÂ zest!â€ He likes to pound the desk or table as he talks, and this passage was punctuated:Â loveÂ (bang) â€¦ love (bang) â€¦Â zest!Â (bang bangbang!). Anne Gust Brown, a former Gap executive in her midâ€‘50s, who became his wife eight years ago and is widely regarded as his most influential and practical-minded adviser, arched an eyebrow from the other side of the room, where she was half-listening while working at a computer. â€œEd-mund!â€ she said smilingly, but being sure to get his attention. (His official name is Edmund Gerald Brown Jr., after his father, Edmund G. â€œPatâ€ Brown, who was governor for eight years before he lost to Ronald Reagan in 1966.) â€œDonâ€™t get yourself too worked up!â€ As a note on nomenclature: apart from his wifeâ€™s occasional joking use of Edmund and my own antiquated sense that I should address him as Governor, every other person I heard speak aboutâ€”or withâ€”him called him Jerry. THE MAN â€œJerry to me is still the most interesting American politician,â€ Nathan Gardels, the editor ofÂ New Perspectives Quarterly, in Los Angeles, and a longtime friend of Brownâ€™s, told me. â€œHe is the only one I know who is ruthlessly practical but with a civilizational outlook. Kind of a combination of Erasmus and Machiavelliâ€â€”the latter meaning that Brown is highly skilled rather than evilly manipulative. As a reporter, I have never encountered a politician more willing to talk with, as opposed to talk at, other people than Jerry Brown. â€œI think as I speak,â€ he told me early this year, underscoring the obvious, when I met him in Washington. He and his wife were in town for the National Governors Association conference. As I waited for them in the conference-center lobby on a Sunday morning, I saw governors from modest-size states bustle through, each with an earpiece-equipped security detail and a covey of aides. When the Browns arrived, they were alone. â€œI find that a lot of people are more invested in position-taking than they are in the inquiry,â€ he continued. â€œGenerally speaking, I amÂ in the inquiry. I live in the question. People have so many positions, and usually the evidence is not strong enough for them really to be so confident in those conclusions. There are just a lot of things that are not certain.â€ He rattled off a list of decade-by-decade fads and gimmicks for â€œsavingâ€ Americaâ€™s struggling school system, most recently No Child Left Behind and the â€œteacher accountabilityâ€ movement. â€œThe question you have to ask yourself is, if teacher accountability is really the whole key, how can it be that from Comeniusâ€â€”a 17th-century European pioneer in educationâ€”â€œthrough John Dewey and Horace Mann, and going back to the Greeks, everyÂ­body missed this secret, and we figured it out just now? Iâ€™m skeptical of thatâ€”and of you, and Washington, and myself.â€ This was the â€œcivilizationalâ€ outlook Nathan Gardels was referring to. Then, the practicality: â€œThe world is so rich and diverse, and there is this technocratic imperative to impose rules, by small minds.â€ I realize that on the page this could look airy or pompous. In real conversation, Brown gives a convincing impression of weighing thoughts and evidence as he goes. â€œDo you know what â€˜metonymâ€™ means?â€ he asked out of the blue one time. Unfortunately, I didnâ€™t. (To spare you my embarrassment: itâ€™s a name used as a reference for something else, like â€œK Streetâ€ for Washingtonâ€™s lobbying culture, or â€œSilicon Valleyâ€ for the tech industry.) The surprise, coming from a politician, was that he was actually asking for information rather than testing me or pretending he already knew. â€œMe neither,â€ he said after my admission, â€œbut I know itâ€™s very big with the deconstructionists.â€ I did better when he asked whether I knew where the phrase â€œno country for old menâ€ had come from. Yes! Itâ€™s the first line of Yeatsâ€™s â€œSailing to Byzantium,â€ which became the title of a novel by Cormac McCarthy, which was in turn the basis for a 2007 movie by the Coen brothers. Brown said that he was wondering because heâ€™d just talked with a Washington media grandee who used the phrase without knowing that it had any history. â€œJerry didnâ€™t know thereÂ wasÂ a movie,â€ his wife said. Another time he was telling me that â€œderacination,â€ and the loss of local loyalties like the ones he felt as a fourth-Â­generation Californian, made it hard to create political consensus. â€œBut California was built by deracinated people, who keep on coming hereâ€”and America was too,â€ I broke in, being careful to add â€œGovernor.â€ â€œRight, maybe Iâ€™m going too far,â€ he answered, thinking as he spoke. â€œBut â€¦â€ and he proceeded with a slight revision of his point. Brownâ€™s State of the State address this year, which he wrote with the help of his wife (he ad-libs most speeches and has no writers or â€œmessage peopleâ€), included an account of a party of Spanish explorers, led by Gaspar de PortolÃ¡, who in 1769 went from Baja California to Monterey Bay. Classing up a speech with historical nuggets is a standard political move. But usually speakers like to imply that the quote from Mark Twain or insight from the Punic Wars is something theyâ€™ve known since earliest tutelage rather than something they recently happened across. In speeches and in conversation, Brown emphasizes his ongoing discoveries. â€œI was just reading about Cicero, and did you know they chopped his head off and put it on a pikeâ€”and a lady put a pin through his tongue with a sign saying Enough of his eloquence?,â€ Brown, who was a classics major at Berkeley, said to me. â€œIâ€™ve been reading a lot about how screwed-up the Roman Republic was.â€ THE STATE As for the problems Brown and his state are wrestling with, they are Americaâ€™s problemsâ€”but worse. Here we leave the governor for a moment to consider the environment he is working in, which is both emblematic of and surprisingly different from America as a whole. You can go too far with the idea that California shows how all of America will look a few years from now. The stateâ€™s population is already more heavily Hispanic than the U.S. population might ever be: Hispanics, at nearly 40 percent, are about to overtake Californiaâ€™s â€œnon-Hispanic whiteâ€ percentage to become the largest ethnic group in the state. (Nationwide, Hispanics are about 17 percent of the population.) Relative to the country as a whole, Asians also make up a larger share of Californiaâ€™s populationâ€”Â­roughly 15 percent of the state, versus about 8 percent of the countryâ€”while blacks and whites represent smaller shares. (California is about 40 percent white and 6 percent black, versus 63 percent and 12 percent, respectively, for the United States.) Largely because of these demographic shifts, the Republican Party, which a generation ago relied on California as the largest element of its Sunbelt base, now barely bothers to mount statewide races except those self-financed by political-novice millionaires like Meg Whitman, who lost badly to Brown in 2010, and Carly Fiorina, who lost badly to Barbara Boxer for the U.S. Senate that same year. In 2012, Barack Obama beat Mitt Romney by 3 million votes in Californiaâ€”and by only 2 million more in the other 49 states combined. In both houses of the state legislature the Democrats have, for now, a two-thirds â€œsupermajorityâ€ that allows them to prevail even against Californiaâ€™s version of the filibuster. â€œThe Republicans appear to have no power,â€ Jerry Brown told me. â€œSome of them are nice people, but they arenâ€™t needed for any votes [in the legislature], and they donâ€™t participate.â€ In other ways tangible and subjective, California is an outlier. Its median income is much higher than Americaâ€™sâ€”but so is its unemployment rate. Its prison system is large and fantastically expensive. Two of its sizable cities (Stockton and San Bernardino) have filed for bankruptcy. And it has myriad other problems. Still, California is usefully representative of the country in one very important way. What is good, and bad, about America is better, and worse, in its most populous state. So, what is strongest about America relative to other societies and economiesâ€”its ability to attract and absorb outside talent, its university-based research system, its advantages of scale and natural resources, its acceptance of risk and second-chance-taking, its fecundity in creating new companies, industries, and productsâ€”is, across the board, stronger still in California. The stateâ€™s brand names and the creativity and wealth they signifyâ€”Apple and Intel, Google and Facebook, Disney and Fox, Stanford and Berkeley, Sunkist and Napa/Sonoma, the nuclear technologies of Lawrence Livermore and the biotech centers of San Diegoâ€”outshine those of most nations. It is one of the few states whose range of economic strengths, from agriculture to manufacturing to mining to services to education to tourism to medicine and nearly every subÂ­sector in between, mirrors that of the country. But what is weakest about Americaâ€”the squabbling paralysis of the governing structures, the relentless pressure on the middle class, the steady decline of public schools, roads, parks and the simultaneous rise of the public-security stateâ€”is weaker and worse in California. Taxes are high, school performance is low, classroomsâ€”and, most glaringly, prisonsâ€”are jammed, and the bridges and freeways that, when brand-new, enabled Californiaâ€™s expansion under Pat Brown in the â€™50s and â€™60s are now crumbling constraints on its potential. Anyone with ties to California has personal illustrations of this shift, and here is one of mine. As a small-town Southern California schoolchild in the Pat Brown era, I had barely heard of such a thing as a private school, nor an overcrowded road, nor of any reason being in California could be a minus rather than a plus. For my two sons, as they build their businesses and start their families there, â€œCaliforniaâ€ has become a metonym for high taxes, rigid bureaucracies, substandard schools and services, and an overall drag on rather than boost for the businesses that nonetheless continue to emerge there. The city government of San Francisco has the manpower to put spray-painted markings around cracked parts of the public sidewalks, and to note which buildings have been tagged with graffitiâ€”but not to fix the problems it identifies. Instead, it sends notices to the owners of homes and buildings saying that they face stiff penalties if they do not repair the sidewalks or remove the graffiti themselves. The kind of urban-dystopia stories I heard from Manhattanites in the 1970s or about Washington, D.C., in the 1980s come from Californians now. Americaâ€™s dynamism and ingenuity have kept it ahead of its public-institution paralysis, so far. The same is true, barely, for California. â€œThe idea that people are really going to move their companies to Nevada because of taxes is nonsense,â€ Paul Saffo, a longtime technology analyst based in Northern California, told me. â€œSilicon Valley has always been a high-cost place to operate and, like the state, has always been in danger of drowning in the products of its own success.â€ Jerry Brown told me about aÂ LookÂ magazine cover story from the mid-1960s, which after the Watts riots in Los Angeles and Free Speech Movement upheaval at Berkeley declared California a â€œfailed state.â€ Since that timeÂ LookÂ magazine has disappeared, Californiaâ€™s population has doubled, and its economy has grown larger than those of Brazil and Spain. Still, Californiaâ€™s challenge is Americaâ€™s: how to manage public business competently enoughâ€”collecting taxes, covering costs, educating children, fostering research, protecting the environment, maintaining orderâ€”to allow the creative carnival of its private activities to go on. And this is where Jerry Brownâ€™s accomplishment seems most impressive. Arnold Schwarzenegger left office with a budget deficit of about $27 billion, having covered some of the stateâ€™s obligations during his final year in office with IOUs. This yearâ€™s budget shows a surplus of at least $500 million. â€œWeÂ areÂ governable!,â€ Brown told me, emphasizing it because so many people have argued the reverse. â€œWe balanced our budget. Arnold just borrowed money, but weâ€™re paying down our debts. Weâ€™re coming back.â€ That is what Iâ€™ve been going back to my home state to ask about. Is the turnaround real? Has Californiaâ€™s brokenness been fixed? And do the answers, whatever they are, make any difference to the country as a whole? THE COMEBACKâ€”OR THE REPRIEVE The easiest question to answer is how California has pulled its way out of its budgetary disaster. Three things have happened since Jerry Brown replaced Arnold Schwarzenegger: the overall economy got better, so more people paid more taxes; state spending went down, largely at Brownâ€™s insistence; and Californiaâ€™s voters approved a significant tax increase, mostly on annual incomes higher than $1 million. Each of these has its fine points. California depends more on income tax, especially from rich taxpayers (even before the new increase) than it used to. This makes its revenues notoriously volatile. They fall very fast when the state economy is contractingâ€”Brown had 10 percent less money to work with in his first year than Schwarzenegger had had in his lastâ€”but also rise quickly when conditions improve, as they have begun to do. One other aspect of the stateâ€™s tax structure compounds its problems. The fastest-growing parts of its economy are those classified as â€œservices,â€ from entertainment and health care to infotech and finance. But most of these are untaxed. In the words of a recent report on the stateâ€™s finances, â€œCaliforniaâ€™s tax code is so outdated that nearly $1 trillionâ€”that is, roughly halfâ€”of the stateâ€™s economic output is not taxed.â€ And this despite the stateâ€™s image as being overtaxed. The budget cuts have been substantial, and came at Brownâ€™s insistence to an often skeptical Democratic-dominated legisÂ­lature. This may be the place to note a difference between state and national budgets. During economic slowdowns, national governments do and should run budget deficits, to keep unÂ­employment from getting worse. Otherwise public-sector layoffs intensify, rather than offset, what is already happening in the private economy. It is different for state governments. Many, though not Californiaâ€™s, have constitutions forbidding deficit spending. And not even California can view deficits as a state-level stimulus program, since so much of the spending sloshes out beyond state borders. During Brownâ€™s first stretch as governor, details of his austere personal lifeâ€”unglamorous Plymouth, sparsely furnished apartment, mattress on the floor instead of a bedâ€”seemed merely part of his oddball ex-seminarian image. (Brown entered a Jesuit seminary at age 18 and spent several years there. He frequently quotes lines from his Jesuit training about learning to limit oneâ€™s demands and thus be happy with less.) His main working office is in a third-story loft in an old Sears, Roebuck building in the â€œuptownâ€ area of Oakland, the revival of which was one of his projects during his years as mayor. (Many modern governors have maintained only a token presence in Sacramento; through most of his eight years in office, Arnold Schwarzenegger commuted from his home in Los Angeles rather than spend the night in what is still an out-of-the-way town.) The most luxurious aspect of Brownâ€™s current life is the house he and his wife bought six years ago in the Oakland Hills, which is valued at about $1.8 million. Brown has also inherited a share of what was once his great-grandfatherâ€™s 2,700â€‘acre ranch in Colusa County, in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada. This forebear, his fatherâ€™s maternal grandÂ­father, August Schuckman, was born in Westphalia but left after the revolutions of 1848 and made his way across North America by wagon train during the California Gold Rush. â€œHeâ€™d lend money to people, and when they couldnâ€™t pay, heâ€™d get their land instead,â€ Brown told me. â€œThatâ€™s how he put together this big spread.â€ Brown said that when he was a boy, his father, then an aspiring politician headed toward the governorÂ­ship, would take the family up to see the property. â€œI never cared about it then. It was too hot. Too many rattlesnakes. Now, as I get older, I go more and more and think about what it took my great-Â­grandfather to get there.â€ â€œBy the time he returned as governor, he still had an image as an ascetic person,â€ Bruce Cain told me. â€œThat image was consistent with his message that he would be careful with your money.â€ Brownâ€™s current role as the Democrat who is cutting budgets brings up the inevitable â€œNixon goes to Chinaâ€ analogy, but I think the more important comparison is to an earlier Republican president, Dwight Eisenhower. The most admirable part of Eisenhowerâ€™s policy, in retrospect, was his effort to push big infrastructure and national-greatness effortsâ€”the interstate highway system, more money for schools and basic research, much of it of course with a Cold War rationaleâ€”while holding the line on other spending, including the Pentagonâ€™s. Iâ€™m oversimplifying the story of the â€™50s to make the point that the Jerry Brown of 2010 comes closer to that part of Ikeâ€™s balance than anyone else Iâ€™m aware of. â€œFor me to get the budget cuts these past two years, I had to go to the legislature and say â€˜Please, please, please!â€™ â€ he told me. â€œThe Democratsâ€â€”who control the legislatureâ€”â€œdidnâ€™t like it, but they agreed as part of getting the tax increase.â€ In California, the governor has line-item-veto authorityâ€”one more indication of the legislatureâ€™s feeblenessâ€”and Brown says he will use his veto power to resist spending increases. â€œThe budget is more or less balanced,â€ he told me. â€œToÂ unÂ­balance things now, they have to come through me. That is a real shift in power.â€ Meanwhile, Brownâ€™s reduced and balanced budget includes more spending for what he considers the big challenges of the future: clean-energy initiatives, an expensive (and controversial) north-to-south high-speed-rail project, new canals and aqueducts, even California-based medical-research projects beyond those sponsored by the National Institutes of Health. For students of California politics, Brownâ€™s most surprising achievement was persuading the legislature to eliminate urban â€œredevelopment agenciesâ€ against the bitter opposition of nearly every big-city mayor in the state, most of them Democrats. â€œRedevelopment agenciesâ€ were a stratagem that one San Francisco analyst has described as â€œthe California equivalent of the national military-industrial complex.â€ Without getting into the details, their effect was to channel a certain share of tax money into a special fund that mayors and local officials could use to finance housing projects, malls, and similar efforts. In theory this was a step toward wholesome decentralization, but in practice the agencies were often wasteful and occasionally corrupt. â€œThis was Brownâ€™s really interesting move,â€ Joe Mathews, of the Los Angelesâ€“based civic group ZÃ³calo Public Square, told me. â€œThese had turned into a racket, and he understood that and was able to unplug it.â€ Most state legislators had no idea why these agencies mattered, or how much money was involved. Brown, a two-term mayor, knew just what was at stake. â€œI think the root of his transformation was his being mayor of Oakland,â€ Lou Cannon, a longtime reporter forÂ The Washington PostÂ and the author of several books about Ronald Reagan, told me in Los Angeles. During the 1970s and â€™80s, Cannon had often criticized Brownâ€™s performance as governor. â€œHe did a very good job as mayor, and obviously has learned a lot about the realities of government.â€ Brown has tried to cut spending so much that the main complaints about him are from the left, and budget-relatedâ€”Â­especially about his resistance to federal court orders to spend more on Californiaâ€™s enormous and overcrowded prison system. â€œFiscal discipline is not the enemy of our good intentions but the basis for realizing them,â€ he said in this yearâ€™s State of the State speech, justifying a hard line against letting spending increases sop up new revenues. â€œIt is cruel to lead people on by expanding good programs, only to cut them back when the funding disappears.â€ â€œThis time Brown has been on the sensible side of every fiscal issue,â€ Lou Cannon told me. â€œThere are people who will want to spend like crazy, and Brown will use his line-item-veto power to resist.â€ The third and most publicized part of the California budget turnaround was Brownâ€™s success last fall in winning passage of Proposition 30, which (among other things) raised high-end tax rates for several years, with a commitment to use the money to avoid cuts in school funding and to pay down the state debt. Everyone I asked said that Brownâ€™s personal stumping for the measure made the difference in its relatively easy win (by a 55â€“45 margin), and that the extra money it is expected to bring inâ€”$6 billion or more a yearâ€”will make a difference in the budget. The higher rates will last for seven years, and Brown in his speeches told the biblical story of Joseph, Pharaoh, and the seven fat years and seven lean years. â€œThe people have given us seven years of extra taxes,â€ he said in his State of the State speech. â€œLet us follow the wisdom of Joseph, pay down our debts, and store up reserves against the leaner times that will surely come.â€ I cannot think of another prominent Democrat who would put it just that way, especially the final few words. Keep reading about the California comeback at The Atlantic &gt; More from The Atlantic:
Under the guise of â€œconsumer protectionâ€ or â€œfood safetyâ€ or some other harmless moniker, it generates zany laws that tend to benefit large corporations. But last week, it went too far, even for Europeans â€“ not that they donâ€™t already have enough crises on their hands. It passed a law that banned restaurants from serving olive oil in refillable containers, such as cruets or dipping bowls. On January 1, 2014, their use would become illegal. Instead, olive oil would have to be served in a one-use-only bottle, labeled in accordance with EU standards, and equipped with a tamper-proof â€œhygienicâ€ spout. A restaurant owner in Germany, for example, who buys his special olive oil from an artisan producer in Southern France, would be out of luck; that small producer wouldnâ€™t be able to comply with the costly stipulations. The restaurant would have to switch to an industrial supplier that can ship the special restaurant bottles with their tamper-proof spout and EU label. The small producer would be cut out. The Commissionâ€™s decision was made under a Eurocrat procedure, called comitology â€“ though it sounds like it, Iâ€™m not making this up! It allows for legislation that is binding for all 27 Member States to be passed into law automatically, without majority support from those Member States. Exactly! The evil that this new law was supposed to cure: olive oil fraud. Admittedly, itâ€™s a big issue in Europe, in the US, and elsewhere, and some of the largest industrial brands, such as Bertolli, have gotten caught with their pants down. But this law wasnâ€™t going after fraud at the corporate level. On the contrary. It was passed under heavy lobbying from corporate producers. The law targeted restaurateurs trying to make their own decisions about olive oil. Ostensibly it aimed to protect consumers and their taste buds from cruets or dipping bowls that had been refilled with low-quality or adulterated olive oil ... the kind maybe that big brands like Bertolli and others were sued for selling in California. But when asked if theyâ€™d seen any evidence of adulterated olive oil on restaurant tables, an official told the Daily Telegraph, â€œWe donâ€™t have any evidence; it is anecdotal and that was enough for the committee.â€ The decision exemplified whatâ€™s wrong with EU governance. But there were other issues with the harebrained law. It would create a cesspool of bureaucracy and mountains of additional trash, including the small one-use-only tamper-proof bottles with their spouts, boxes, and containers. And more oil would be wasted as the bottles â€“ much like Ketchup bottles â€“ would be designed to make it impossible to get all the oil out of them. But this time, the Commission and its process of comitology were greeted with an outburst of loathing and mockery. Criticism was â€œuniversal and came from consumers and restaurant owners in all EU countries,â€ an EU official told the Telegraph. And it came from the very top. â€œThis is exactly the sort of thing that Europe shouldnâ€™t even be discussing,â€ explained UK Prime Minster David Cameron, with an eye on the real problems that are currently dogging Europe. â€œIt shouldnâ€™t even be on the table, to force a pun â€“ so to speak,â€ he said. And Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte told his parliament, â€œI think it is too bizarre for words and incomprehensible to come with this sort of proposal at a time like this.â€ European Commission President JosÃ© Manuel Barroso, son of a small olive oil producer, apparently intervened, and on Thursday, European Agriculture Commissioner Dacian Ciolos threw in the towel. The law provoked some â€œmisunderstanding,â€ though it was â€œintended to help consumers, to protect and inform them,â€ he said. But now that it was â€œclear that it cannot attract consumer support,â€ heâ€™d withdraw it. Not everyone jubilated. â€œIt is totally ludicrous that the commission just withdraws this measure due to political pressure,â€ said Pekka Pesonen, general secretary of COPA-COGECA, a lobbying group representing industrial producers, and one of the forces behind the law. â€œPerhaps it wasnâ€™t explained well enough. But it was necessary to ban refillable bottles and the traditional aceiteras found on restaurant tables....â€ etc. etc. The thing isnâ€™t dead yet. Ciolos said that heâ€™d have a huddle with opponents and critics of the law in order to somehow resuscitate it â€“ because itâ€™s just too good to let die. So this law about olive oil in restaurants has morphed into a symbol of governance by Eurocrats â€“ and their raggedy efforts to manage the economy of the EU. The solar-panel industry, once fattened by taxpayer subsidies and false hopes, has been in a death spiral. In Germany, it has been brutal. Even large companies are licking their wounds. And yet, when the European Commission tried to protect manufacturers against cheap Chinese imports, the unexpected happened. Read.... Germany Fires Live Ammo In Sino-European Trade War ...
