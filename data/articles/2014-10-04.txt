When investing, the stakes are alarmingly real: If we screw it up, we lose money.  In his book "The 5 Mistakes Every Investor Makes And How To Avoid Them," Peter Mallouk outlines some of the most common investor errors he's seen over the course of his career as a wealth manager. His firm, Creative Planning Private Wealth Management, manages about $10 billion for clients across the country, and has been named by CNBC as the top independent wealth management firm in the US. So it's safe to say that he knows what he's talking about. While he dives into more detail in the book, here's a quick overview of Mallouk's five recurring investor mistakes: People who time the market try and be strategic about investing their money when the market is on the upswing, and pulling it out when the market is taking a bad turn. The problem with market timing, Mallouk writes, is that it doesn't work. In fact, he divides the vast majority of market timers into two camps: idiots and liars. He says that liars are people in the financial industry whose paydays come from making predictions — whether or not they're right — and idiots are the well-meaning investors who remember only their good decisions and triumphs. The market is volatile, Mallouk explains, but there's a reason to let your money ride the wave: "The risk of being out is far greater than the risk of being in," he writes. "Being on the sideline often results in permanently missing the upside. On the other hand, if someone invests today, the worst thing that can happen is temporarily participating in the downside. Big difference." Margin CallUnless you work as a trader, you probably don't want an actively traded portfolio. Active trading means choosing to buy and sell stocks quickly and regularly, rather than letting your investments lay low and play a long-term game. The idea is that you'll be so smart about your purchases or sales that you'll beat the "market return," or the combined return of stocks listed on exchanges like the NYSE. Mallouk points out that among people trying to beat the market, there are going to be people who do better and people who do worse: winners and losers. "Here's the rub though," he writes. "Trading isn't free — there is always a cost." He explains that, like in a Vegas casino, the house always wins. In this case, the house is the brokerage.  Because the house always wins, the "winners" in this scenario aren't doing as well as they thought. They have to pay the house, and taxes on their "winnings," and even those people who win enough to cover all these costs aren't any more likely to do it again in the future. "One thing kills off almost all the winners: time," Mallouk writes. "With time, the winners in the stock trading game tend to become losers." There's a lot of financial information out there, but that doesn't mean it's clear — and even if it is, that doesn't mean we always understand or act on it correctly. The first example Mallouk presents of a common misunderstanding is "judging performance in a vacuum."  "Assume you have a room full of 12,000 people and tell them to flip a coin," Mallouk writes. "If you repeat this about 13 times, someone will likely have flipped heads every time. We should not marvel at the brilliance of such a person. Rather, we should expect this outcome." He explains that money managers, who usually manage a handful of portfolios or funds, are bound to outperform the market sometimes. They highlight their best-performing portfolio or fund to wow a potential investor, but the reality is that this portfolio or fund's performance doesn't say all that much about the manager. Rather, one of his holdings was bound to do well by sheer chance. "When you look at the vast reference set of mutual funds and hedge funds, the overwhelming majority underperform, and there is no evidence the winners will continue to win," Mallouk writes. He says that you should ignore a portfolio manager's past performance. "In fact, if you are working with an advisor who actually takes into account your personal situation ... then the portfolio should be customized to a point that they cannot show past model performance."  Flickr/NYC DOTFor most people, investments will do fine on their own. When Mallouk writes about "letting yourself get in the way," he's adding his voice to those who encourage investors to admit what they don't know — a typical investor isn't an expert, and believing you are could lead to trouble. "If you have a reasonable level of intelligence and you understand the basic principles of this book, you will likely outperform the great majority of investors," Mallouk writes. "The key is to not mess things up."  Mallouk says that emotional factors such as fear, greed, overconfidence, and mental biases lead to the biggest mistake investors make: letting themselves get in the way. "Take a step back, slow down, and follow the disciplined plan you have laid out for you and your family," he writes. "The car is going to get to its destination, unless you personally drive it off the cliff." Working with a financial advisor can be a smart idea, and Mallouk points out that high net worth individuals are more likely to do so, due to the increased stakes that come with wealth. However, Mallouk says that most advisors do more harm than good. He recommends making sure the advisor isn't a broker who may earn commission through selling unnecessary securities, getting disclosure about that advisor's compensation structure in writing, and, if planning is involved, making sure a certified financial planner is on the team. "Understand the issues of custody and competence," Mallouk writes, "but most importantly, make sure your advisor has no conflict and follows the investment philosophy that makes sense for you. Put your requirements in writing, and stick to them." FREE AppDownload

Hong Kong's weary chief executive warned pro-Democracy protesters Saturday that police would "take all actions necessary" to restore order in the autonomous Chinese region. However, those words may have strengthened the protesters' resolve, The New York Times reports. Thousands of protesters gathered outside government headquarters on Saturday evening in one of the largest-ever rallies their campaign has seen. “We know that every time they assault us, we resist harder,” Alex Chow Yong Kang, the secretary general of the Hong Kong Federation of Students, told the crowd, according to The Times. “And we know we’re on the right path, otherwise the government wouldn’t have been so afraid of us.” REUTERS/Bobby Yip The protesters are fighting for the right to choose their political candidates, rather than having to choose from a pool of candidates pre-selected by China, as CNN has reported. They're also seeking the removal of Hong Kong's Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying, who they argue is in the pocket of Beijing.  On Saturday, Leung told the protesters they were thwarting the efforts of 3,000 civil servants to get to work on time, the Telegraph reported.  Wong Maye-E/APA student protester gets emotional while pleading for a peaceful resolution, Thursday, Oct. 2, 2014 in Hong Kong. "The police have the responsibility and resolution to take all actions necessary to resume social order and let the government and all 7 million citizens resume their normal work and life," he said, according to the Telegraph. Many protesters reportedly saw that statement as a veiled threat. FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersGreece's Deputy Finance Minister Christos Staikouras listens to a question during a news conference at the ministry in AthensATHENS (Reuters) - Greece will aim to achieve a primary budget surplus of 2.9 percent of output next year, just shy of the 3 percent target set out under its bailout deal, its deputy finance minister said in an interview published Saturday. The target is part of a 2015 draft budget that Athens will submit to parliament on Monday amid a bailout review by the "troika" of inspectors from its international lenders, the European Union and International Monetary Fund. A finance ministry official had told Reuters on Friday that Athens would lower the 2015 primary surplus target only marginally, sticking "close to" the 3 percent figure. In an interview with the weekly To Vima newspaper, Deputy Finance Minister Christos Staikouras also said that a "solidarity tax" introduced at the height of Greece's debt crisis will be cut by 30 percent next year. Athens said last month that unpopular taxes, including the solidarity tax and a heating oil consumption tax, will be lowered to show that four years of austerity is nearing an end. Staikouras also said that Athens was expected to beat this year's primary budget surplus target of 1.5 percent of GDP. "Based on current data, the primary surplus (of 2014) is estimated at around 2 percent of GDP, considerably higher than the target," he said. The budget surplus has been viewed as an indicator of Greece's progress in putting its finances in order during an economic crisis that wiped out almost a quarter of its GDP and sent unemployment to record highs of nearly 27 percent. Greece topped its fiscal targets and achieved a budget surplus in 2013, a year ahead of schedule, paving the way for some form of additional debt relief from its euro zone lenders. Talks on further debt relief will start later this year.  (Reporting by Angeliki Koutantou; Editing by Catherine Evans) FREE AppDownload

REUTERS/Jessica RinaldiJeffrey Gundlach cofounder and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer of DoubleLine.The drama in the bond world just will not stop. In this week's edition of Barron's, Joe Mansueto, CEO of investment firm Morningstar, published a letter to the editor firing back at the magazine following its story a week ago about the firm's supposed feud with bond king Jeff Gundlach. Mansueto wrote: Jonathan R. Laing’s column about Morningstar and bond-fund manager Jeffrey Gundlach ("Blood Feud," Streetwise, Sept. 29) painted a false portrayal of Morningstar and our analysts’ coverage of Gundlach’s DoubleLine Total Return Bond fund. Despite several interviews and e-mail exchanges with Laing over the course of two years, he didn’t quote anyone from Morningstar and left out 99% of what we shared with him.  Ouch. In last week's Barron's, Laing wrote that Morningstar and Gundlach were locked in a "blood feud" over Morningstar's decision to put a "not ratable" rating on Gundlach's DoubleLine Total Return Bond fund. Laing outlined what appeared to be a checkered history between Gundlach and Morningstar, which included an apparent fixing of Morningstar's 2009 vote for its Bond Manager of the Year award, which Gundlach apparently won on a first ballot but was later defeated by Loomis Sayles' Daniel Fuss in a second vote.  Mansueto concluded with: "Laing’s conclusion that our analysts have a foot on the scale when it comes to DoubleLine is inaccurate. We hold every manager we cover to the same standards of transparency. If we tip the scales, it’s on the side of the investor." And this spat between Barron's, Morningstar, and DoubleLine is all just background noise to the still-shocking departure of Bill Gross from PIMCO last week. In this week's Barron's, the magazine published a big interview with Gross that is a must-read. Gross explained that managing money is "in his blood," and also gave a quick overview of how he sees the current economic and investment landscape and what interests him as he gets set to start at Janus on Monday.

via The Motley FoolWarren Buffett's house.Warren Buffett's house is the object of endless fascination when people learn about him -- and for good reason. Buffett is one of the richest people in the world; therefore, it's always surprising to learn that he's lived in the same house for most of his adult life. Looking more closely, Warren Buffett's house can teach you a lot about success and what's important in life. Warren Buffett bought his house in Omaha, Nebraska in 1958 for $31,500. The house is stucco, and has five bedrooms and 2.5 baths. Warren Buffett has called his house "the third best investment" he ever made, behind only wedding rings. In reverse order, here are the biggest lessons we can learn about success from Warren Buffett's house. What does Warren Buffet's house tell you about how much he's worth? Nothing.  Most people's idea of wealth isn't someone who has a million dollars in the bank; it's of someone spending a million dollars. Too often, people confuse the trappings of wealth with actual wealth. Warren Buffett is now worth an estimated $68 billion. You can't tell how much someone is worth from his or her house or car. Wealth is about what you don't see. Warren Buffett's house is the same house he originally bought; but it was not a financial investment in the sense that Warren's goal wasn't appreciation in value. Warren bought a house he could afford, and has called it one of his best investments because, "My family and I gained 52 years of terrific memories with more to come." Warren didn't lose sight of the idea that a home is for living in rather than for speculation on housing prices. When you mix the two, bad things can happen. One thing you may notice about Warren Buffett's house is that there is only one. As Warren Buffett wrote in his Giving Pledge: Some material things make my life more enjoyable; many, however, would not. I like having an expensive private plane, but owning a half-dozen homes would be a burden. Too often, a vast collection of possessions ends up possessing its owner. The asset I most value, aside from health, is interesting, diverse, and long-standing friends. "All things considered, the third best investment I ever made was the purchase of my home, though I would have made far more money had I instead rented and used the purchase money to buy stocks," says Buffett. On a purely financial level, data shows that, over the long term, houses do not return much above inflation, while the stock market generally does. Robert Shiller has collected home price data in the U.S. as far back as 1890. On an inflation-adjusted level, home prices have not risen much. Robert Shiller ^SPX data by YCharts. There are many definitions of success, but the size of your house has nothing to do with it. While life will have its ups and downs, continuous learning, thinking for yourself, developing good habits, focusing on the long term, and having fun on the journey, is what you need to set yourself up for success in life. It's as simple as that. FREE AppDownload

GettyMichael Kors shares have been tumbling this year.The Michael Kors brand might be past its prime.  The fashion label, which enjoyed a stunning rise in popularity in recent years, is facing new challenges to its business. Forbes announced this week that Michael Kors is no longer a billionaire because shares have declined 25% in six months. Here are a few big problems with the brand.  Widespread popularity is the "kiss of death for trendy fashion brands, particularly those positioned in the up-market younger consumer sectors," industry expert Robin Lewis writes on his blog. Lewis compares Michael Kors to Tommy Hilfiger, which reached its peak in the late '90s.  Michael Kors is considered an aspirational brand, with consumers paying a premium for its label. Once everyone has the product, it is no longer considered cool.  Other brands who have experienced this phenomenon include Juicy Couture, Jordache, and Coach.  Baird Equity ResearchGoogle searches for the brand are declining in the US. Michael Kors is entering the current quarter with a 65% inventory increase, writes retail equity analyst Marie Driscoll.  While the company says that the excess inventory is because of the company taking the e-commerce business in-house, Driscoll is skeptical that it will sell.   "That’s a lot of inventory in an increasingly competitive category," she writes. "I'm worried." She also compares Michael Kors to the Tommy Hilfiger collapse more than a decade ago.  "While the brand continues to enjoy vibrant demand, these investors are on to greener pastures," she says. "It’s probably time to sell KORS shares!" Yahoo! FinanceShares are down 25% in six months. Michael Kors has also has several brands at different price points, a strategy that could easily backfire, Lewis says. Kors has a high-end department store brand, a middle-market brand, and discount outlet stores.  "Some would argue all of those segments will simply end up competing with each other, thus cannibalizing the top end of the spectrum," he writes.  In other words, consumers won't pay $300 for a department store Michael Kors bag when they can get one at the outlet mall for half-price.  FREE AppDownload

Steve Jennings/Getty Images for TechCrunchTheranos chairman, CEO, and founder Elizabeth Holmes at TechCrunch Disrupt at Pier 48 on Sept. 8 in San Francisco. No more wondering to yourself, "Ah, how much more can they take before I pass out?" Instead you might be able to walk into a Walgreens pharmacy for a reportedly painless fingerprick that will draw just a tiny drop of blood, thanks to Elizabeth Holmes, 30, the youngest woman and third-youngest billionaire on Forbes' newly released annual ranking of the 400 richest Americans. Revolutionizing the blood test is a golden idea. Because of new testing methods developed by Holmes' startup Theranos, that lone drop can now yield a ton of information. The company can run hundreds of tests on a drop of blood far more quickly than could be done with whole vials in the past — and it costs a lot less. Holmes dropped out of Stanford at 19 to found what would become Theranos after deciding that her tuition money could be better put to use by transforming healthcare. Traditional blood testing is shockingly difficult and expensive for a tool that's used so frequently. It also hasn't changed since the 1960s. It's done in hospitals and doctors' offices. Vials of blood have to be sent out and tested, which can take weeks using traditional methods and is prone to human error. And, of course, sticking a needle in someone's arm scares some people enough that they avoid getting blood drawn, even when it could reveal lifesaving information. Holmes recognized that process was ripe for disruption. It took a decade for her idea to be ready for primetime, but now it seems that her decision to drop out was undoubtedly a good call. Last year, Walgreen Co. announced that it would be installing Theranos Wellness Centers in pharmacies across the country, with locations already up and running in Phoenix and Palo Alto, California. And Holmes has raised $400 million in venture capital for Theranos, which is now valued at $9 billion (Holmes owns 50%). The other two 30-year-olds on Forbes' List, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his former roommate and Facebook CEO Dustin Moskovitz, also have access to a wealth of information about people — but their data is less likely to directly save a life. Courtesy Theranos One closely guarded secret is what MedCityNews calls "the most interesting part of [the Theranos] story": how exactly the technology behind its blood test works. The company's methods are protected by more than a dozen patents filed as far back as 2004 and as recently as last week. In an interview with Wired, Holmes hinted at some of the key ideas behind Theranos. "We had to develop ... methodologies that would make it possible to accelerate results," she said. "In the case of a virus or bacteria, traditionally tested using a culture, we measure the DNA of the pathogen instead so we can report results much faster." While we can't yet assess independently how well that method works when compared with traditional blood tests, it already seems to be upending the old way of doing things. Holmes told Medscape that she targeted lab medicine because it drives about 80% of clinical decisions made by doctors. By zeroing in on the inefficiencies of that system, the Theranos approach completely revolutionizes it. The new tests can be done without going to the doctor, which saves both money and time. Most results are available in about four hours, which means that you could swing by a pharmacy and have a test done the day before a doctor's visit, and then the results would be available for the physician. Quick tests that can be done at any time are already a total change, but the amount of data the company can get from a single drop of blood is amazing. Blood samples have traditionally been used for one test, but if a follow-up was needed, another sample had to be drawn and sent out — making it less likely that someone would get care. The Theranos approach means the same drop can be used for dozens of different tests. It's cheap, too. One common criticism of the healthcare system is that the pricing structure is a confusing labyrinth that makes it impossible to know how much anything costs. Theranos lists its prices online, and they're impressive. Each test costs less than 50% of standard Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates. If those two programs were to perform all tests at those prices, they'd save $202 billion over the next decade, Holmes said in an interview on Wired. Plus, people get access to their own results. As an example of how helpful that can be, Holmes told Wired that Theranos charges $35 for a fertility test, which is usually paid for out-of-pocket and costs up to $2,000. But she also said that this data could be useful for anyone looking to gain a better understanding of his or her health. "By testing, you can start to understand your body, understand yourself, change your diet, change your lifestyle, and begin to change your life," she said.    FREE AppDownload
JP Yim/Getty ImagesEven the wealthy and famous have to abide by these money rules. Singer Rihanna earns tens of millions of dollars, but found herself "effectively bankrupt" in 2009. She sued her financial adviser for not doing his job. He offered a legendary response: "Was it really necessary to tell her that if you spend money on things you will end up with the things and not the money?" The first iron rule of money is that wealth is the stuff you don't see. It's the cars not purchased, the clothes not bought, the jewelry forgone. Money buys things, but wealth -- assets such as cash, stocks, bonds, in the bank, unspent -- buys freedom and security. Pick which one you want wisely. According to World Bank economist Branko Milanovic, "the poorest [5%] of Americans are better off than more than two-thirds of the world population." Furthermore, "only about 3% of the Indian population have incomes higher than the bottom (the very poorest) U.S. percentile." And those figures are adjusted for differences in cost of living. The easiest way to judge how well you're doing is to compare yourself to people around you. The curse of living in the United States is that most people are doing well, so your own success looks ordinary. If you want to feel rich, look at the 90% of the world that isn't American or European. You'll realize that feeling rich is just a mental game. Successful investing is pretty boring. Its main requirement is patience and inaction. Most people demand more excitement, so they tweak, fiddle, and adjust their investments as much as necessary to destroy as much of their wealth as possible. If you want to do better than average at anything, you must do something that most people can't. In investing, that means putting up with perpetual boredom. It's a serious skill. Getting rich has little to do with your income and everything to do with your savings rate. And your savings rate is just the difference between your ego and your income. Keep the former in check and you should be fine over time. Most people are bad with money, so being good means doing things differently than they do. You won't spend as much. You'll invest differently. You'll grow wealth slower. This can make you look like a fool in the short run. But who cares what others think? They're probably idiots. As Charlie Munger put it, "Someone will always be getting richer faster than you. This is not a tragedy." Not only is it not a tragedy, but it's a necessity. The ability to not care what other people think about what you're doing is mandatory in achieving abnormal results. You can learn more about money from the person who went bankrupt with a subprime mortgage than you can from Warren Buffett. That's because it's easier and more common to be stupid than it is to be brilliant, so you should spend more effort trying to avoid bad decisions than making good ones. Economist Eric Falkenstein summed this up well: "In expert tennis, 80% of the points are won, while in amateur tennis, 80% are lost. The same is true for wrestling, chess, and investing: Beginners should focus on avoiding mistakes, experts on making great moves." As James Grant put it, "To suppose that the value of a stock is determined purely by a corporation's earnings is to forget that people have burned witches, gone to war on a whim, risen to the defense of Joseph Stalin, and believed Orson Welles when he told them over the radio that the Martians had landed." You might be laid off next week. You can be sued tomorrow. Or win the lottery. Maybe you'll get cancer. Or a huge promotion. Stocks can rally for twice as long as you think and crash twice as fast as you assumed. History is one damned thing after another, most of it involves money, and there's nothing you can do about it.    This article originally appeared at The Motley Fool.  Copyright 2014.

Reuters Bill Gross is 70 years old and worth over $2 billion personally, so there was surprise in some corners that the legendary investor didn't just retire after his acrimonious split from PIMCO last month. Instead of retiring, Gross is joining the much smaller investment firm Janus, which currently has just $12 million in it (vs. the greater than $200 billion that Gross managed at the Total Return Fund). So why isn't Gross hanging it up? He was asked that in a Barron's interview, and his answer seems totally honest and believable: Managing money is in my blood. I like to get up at 5:30 in the morning and make money for clients and compete against other money managers. That’s something that doesn’t go away. I am obsessed with delivering value to investors and winning the game from a personal standpoint. Retiring at this point in my career just doesn’t suit me. Sounds totally believable to us.

AP/Mikhail KlimentyevRussian President Vladimir Putin.US officials are far more concerned than they are publicly acknowledging about the gigantic cyberattack against JPMorgan that affected as many as 76 million households. And they believe Russians with at least loose connections to the country's government are behind the attack, according to a new report from The New York Times. JP Morgan revealed Thursday that as many as 76 million households and 7 million small businesses may have had private data compromised in the breach, one of the largest and most serious into a US corporation.  Data that may have been compromised in the breach include contact information and "internal JPMorgan Chase information" relating to the users, according to an SEC filing from the company. They weren't alone, according to the new report. The Times says that "about" nine other financial institutions were infiltrated by the same group of hackers, though the breadth and scope of those breaches aren't known. One US official speculated that the hack may be in retaliation for US sanctions against Russia amid the ongoing crisis in Ukraine. "It could be in retaliation for the sanctions," a senior official told the paper. "But it could be mixed motives — to steal if they can, or to sell whatever information they could glean." The JPMorgan breach did not affect account information or any money inside customers' accounts, the company said Thursday. "There is no evidence that account information for such affected customers — account numbers, passwords, user IDs, dates of birth or Social Security numbers — was compromised during this attack," JPMorgan said in the SEC filing. REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton A trader works at the JP Morgan trading post on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in New York July 13, 2012. But according to the new report in the Times, the hackers got access to one file that has unsettled company executives.  "That file contained a list of every application and program deployed on standard JPMorgan computers that hackers can crosscheck with known, or new, vulnerabilities in each system in a search for a backdoor entry," the report said. Remedying the applications and the program affected by the hack will be costly and time-consuming. It is, one former employee told the paper, as if "they stole the schematics to the Capitol — they can’t just switch out every single door and window pane overnight." Some lawmakers have jumped on news of the hack to push Congress to pass cybersecurity legislation. Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) underscored the urgency, saying in a statement the "next Pearl Harbor" would come in the form of a cyberattack to an unprepared US. "The longer we wait to take action, the more vulnerable we become, and as we've seen today, Americans will pay the price. We simply cannot afford to wait any longer," King said.  "Congress must work to pass legislation that will improve our capabilities and protect us against more attacks like these. The next Pearl Harbor will be cyber, and shame on us if we're not prepared for it." FREE AppDownload

Thomson ReutersA street sign is seen in front of the New York Stock Exchange on Wall Street in New YorkNEW YORK (Reuters) - A positive vibe returned to the U.S. stock market Friday, leaving some to wonder if, after two weeks of losses, the latest selloff scare was over. The best clues may come from what happens to low-quality corporate bonds. The most recent decline in the S&amp;P 500 marks the third time in six months that the market has looked wobbly and threatened a significant reversal. Each time, so far, it has bounced back quickly. But what has some investors most worried this time around is the recent, notable underperformance in junk bonds in the past few months. In the past this has been a precursor to bearishness in the equity market. High-yield corporate bond spreads &lt;.MERH0A0&gt;, the premium investors get for purchasing low quality corporate debt as opposed to benchmark U.S. Treasuries &lt;us10yt=rr&gt;, have been increasing steadily since late June. A widening spread means their performance is lagging higher-quality bonds. The spread has since widened by more than 100 basis points, according to Bank of America-Merrill Lynch data. Previous spikes of this magnitude have preceded pullbacks in the S&amp;P 500, and the greater the selloff in high-yield debt, the worse the outcome was for stocks. "Spreads are widening and it's certainly not a good time for equities. It doesn't have to be a terrible time, but it's telling you people are on the margin taking risk off," said Paul Zemsky, chief investment officer of Multi-Asset Strategies and Solutions at Voya Investment Management in New York. He said that while reduced liquidity in the high-yield bond market could exaggerate the moves in spreads, the overall signal is of a marked shift in sentiment. "I do think (the spread) has some information in terms of risk appetite and how people see economic growth," Zemsky said. High yield most recently started widening against Treasuries beginning on June 23, when the S&amp;P 500 was around 1,960, with the peak set earlier this week at an increase of 116 basis points. The S&amp;P closed the week at 1,967.90 while the yield spread tightened slightly to 107 basis points. The last time such a shift in spreads started was in May 2013, and it preceded a near 6 percent fall in the S&amp;P. Weakening in junk bonds in early 2012 also preceded an S&amp;P downdraft between April and June 2012, when the S&amp;P last flirted with a 10 percent drop. However, the move may not yet signal a market correction. As has been the pattern in 2014, investors are content to move money between different stock market sectors rather than flee altogether. Small-cap shares entered a correction at one point this week and the S&amp;P energy sector fell 13 percent from their 2014 peak, but investors piled into the healthcare sector &lt;.SPXHC&gt;, which hit a lifetime record early last week. In April 2011, high yield spreads began widening in a move that eventually reached 450 basis points. Stocks didn't begin to correct until the spread had moved nearly 100 basis points, but eventually they sank nearly 20 percent. "If you run a chart of junk spreads going back five years this move is tiny. We’ve seen much, much bigger moves in junk, and much bigger selloffs in junk in the last five years," said Brian Reynolds, chief market strategist at Rosenblatt Securities in New York. The current spike, he said, "did predict (the move) in stocks, it did follow through and we’re probably now reaching a climax of panic," he said. This is why the next move in credit spreads becomes key. Next week is relatively light for economic data. Investors haven't run entirely from bond markets, but have shifted funds around. High yield funds saw an outflow of $2.3 billion in the most recent week to Oct. 1, the most since early August, according to Lipper, as they moved money into high-grade corporate debt. The focus may shift again to escalating conflicts in the Middle East, the stubborn weakness of the European economy, or the outcome of Hong Kong pro-democracy protests that are challenging the authority of Beijing. For Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, the key lies in earnings reports, which begin in two weeks. "If we don’t get earnings corroborating the (bearish) story being told by spreads, then I think we’ll see the spreads come in."   (Reporting by Rodrigo Campos; Editing by Martin Howell) FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersJP Morgan Chase & Co sign outside headquarters in New YorkBOSTON (Reuters) - The 83 million customer records that hackers stole from JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co &lt;jpm.n&gt; could fuel years of fraud, as criminals use the information to "phish" for customer passwords and ferret out other accounts that consumers may have, cybercrime researchers said on Friday. The No. 1 U.S. bank by assets said on Thursday in a regulatory filing that customer names, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses were taken in the attack that the bank said surfaced in August. It added that it was continuing to investigate the matter and that customers would not be liable for any unauthorized transactions that were promptly reported to the bank. The bank said it has not seen any rise in fraud in the wake of the discoveries, but security researchers said the information that hackers stole, such as addresses, tends to change relatively slowly, which gives criminals a long time to use it. Their first step will likely be to use the information to send emails to customers purporting to be from JPMorgan Chase. Links embedded in those emails could be used to con customers out of their passwords, a practice known as "phishing." "Hackers might send out emails saying 'Your JPMorgan Chase account has been breached, please log into our portal and enter your information,'" said Alex Holden, chief executive of Hold Security, a cyber security firm that monitors trade in stolen credentials. The bank's letter to account holders on its website mid-day on Friday made no mention of "phishing", but it linked to a "frequently asked questions" document whose last answer warned about "phishing". JPMorgan spokeswoman Patricia Wexler said the bank is making the warning more prominent on its website. "The risk is phishing" Wexler said, adding that people should be on the lookout. She said that there is no evidence that account numbers, passwords, user IDs, birthdays, or Social Security numbers were taken. The stolen data is likely to end up being sold on underground cybercrime exchanges to fraudsters who will use it for "phishing" and other schemes. Holden said it is likely to be broken up into groups based on categories such as zip codes, with wealthy demographics going for higher rates. He estimates that lots of varying sizes would sell for between $1,000 and $15,000, with each of them being resold multiple times. Such information can be used to craft "phishing" emails to seek other types of online accounts, beyond the initial firm that was breached, particularly when combined with personal details from social networking sites such as Facebook &lt;fb.o&gt;, Google &lt;googl.o&gt;, LinkedIn &lt;lnkd.n&gt; and Twitter &lt;twtr.n&gt;, security researchers warned. Details from social media profiles can provide criminals with rich information that they can use to craft convincing "phishing" emails, including information about family, friends, education and work. "Social media helps the criminals pursue their trade," said Mark Rowley, assistant commissioner for specialist operations for London's Metropolitan Police. JPMorgan's Wexler said that the bank is not offering credit monitoring to its customers because no financial information, account data or personally identifiable information was compromised. JPMorgan disclosed at the end of August that it suspected it had been the victim of a cyber attack, and said it had hired outside forensics experts to help it investigate the matter, which law enforcement is also probing. In a letter to investors in April, JPMorgan Chase Chairman and Chief Executive Jamie Dimon told investors that the bank expects to spend more than $250 million on cybersecurity this year, with about 1,000 people focused on the area. The bank's efforts will grow exponentially in the coming years, he added.   (Additional reporting by Eric Auchard and Steve Slater in London and David Henry in New York; Editing by Dan Wilchins and Bernard Orr) FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersA Charles Schwab Investment branch is seen in WashingtonNEW YORK (Reuters) - Charles Schwab Corp. &lt;schw.n&gt; is weeks away from introducing an automated investing service aimed at winning business from novice investors it does not currently serve, company officials told Reuters. The service is being developed in-house and likely will be free, giving the San Francisco-based discount brokerage pioneer a leg up on a slew of upstart firms known as robo-brokers that charge management fees of 0.15 to 0.35 percent of a client's assets. It would position Schwab as the first conventional brokerage with its own robo-broker offering. In automated investing plans, clients fill out questionnaires about investment goals and risk tolerances. Their answers automatically determine the portfolios of exchange-traded funds or other assets they buy. Executives at some large broker-dealers, which typically charge 1 to 3 percent of client assets in managed account programs, have said they do not feel threatened by robo-brokers because they make money offering more sophisticated wealth-planning and investment services to wealthy clients. But they also want to nurture younger investors to replace affluent but aging Baby Boomers, the bulk of their client base. Schwab is betting young investors in early stages of wealth accumulation will remain in-house and use more sophisticated advisory services as they prosper or as markets become complicated, one source said. Like other brokerage firms, it receives payments from mutual funds its clients use as well as interest that accumulates on cash held in their accounts. The automated service is expected to include features such as automatic portfolio rebalancing and tax-loss harvesting that some robo-brokers recently introduced. Neesha Hathi, head of technology solutions for independent investment advisers who use Schwab services, told Reuters on Thursday the program would likely be introduced this month. She did not comment on details, but a person familiar with the plan said it would be introduced without fees. In July, Chief Executive Walt Bettinger told investors Schwab was working on "an online advisory solution," but declined to provide details on timing or whether it would build or buy a robo-service. A Schwab spokeswoman said Friday she could not comment further. Schwab currently offers almost 200 commission-free exchange-traded funds, including several managed by the company. "Schwab definitely has a track record of entering a market by underpricing or pricing low, but I don’t think it has a proven way to dominate markets,” said Adam Nash, chief executive of Wealthfront, Inc., the largest robo-broker with more than $1.4 billion of client assets. As of June 30, Schwab had $2.4 trillion of total client assets, including $11.5 billion of net new assets gathered in the second quarter. Nash would not say whether Wealthfront, which charges a flat advisory fee of 0.25 percent and waives the fee on accounts with $10,000 or less, will adjust its fees to compete with Schwab. Another robo firm, Betterment LLC, "would not alter pricing" if Schwab introduced a free service, said a spokeswoman. "We offer an incredible value." Some consultants said Schwab risks antagonizing outside investment advisers who use its services and fear losing clients, but technology head Hathi disagreed. "There's more of an opportunity here than there is competition," she said, noting that most turn away smaller investors and younger members of families that are clients. "What Walt talked about is that here's a solution for advisers that's going to allow them to serve those accounts."   (Reporting By Jed Horowitz; additional reporting by Suzanne Barlyn editing by Linda Stern and David Gregorio) FREE AppDownload

A Merrill Lynch spokeswoman said the decision to scrap the conference was based on new approaches to training, not cutting costs. For many years, the gathering brought together several hundred branch and complex managers every January, according to sources familiar with it. Last year, it was held in Orlando. "We are moving to smaller, less formal training and integration meetings where our leadership teams can interact easier, build deeper relationships and more fully focus on implementing our goals based strategy," a Merrill Lynch spokeswoman said in an emailed statement. Bank of America's Global Wealth and Investment Management division, where Merrill Lynch resides, reported record high revenues and profit margins in second quarter earnings released in July. Bank of America releases its third quarter earnings on Oct. 15.   (Reporting By Elizabeth Dilts.; Additional reporting by Jed Horowitz. Editing by Andre Grenon) FREE AppDownload
