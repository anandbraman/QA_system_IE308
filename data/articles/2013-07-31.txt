Business Insider / Sam RoRed numbers highlight declines from June.There is no shortage of economists who are skeptical of the data coming out of China, especially the data published by the Chinese government. Indeed, China's export numbers often don't tie out with its trading partners import figures, and vice versa. This brings us to today. Economies around the world are publishing their PMI figures.† And across Asia, the numbers are deteriorating (the image to right is from Business Insider's PMI scorecard). Even the HSBC China PMI number fell to 47.7 in July from 48.2. Any number below 50 signals contraction. However, China's official PMI number, which is produced by the country's National Bureau of statistics, unexpectedly climbed to 50.3 from 50.1 a month ago. Nine of 11 sub-indices increased, including new export orders. What gives? "The HSBC PMI sample is overly represented by small exporters which were hit by rising RMB, rising wage and sluggish global demand," explained Bank Of America Merrill Lynch economist Ting Lu. "However, the official PMI is more represented by domestic big enterprises with large exposure to FAI. The improved sentiment will surely support the official PMI." That doesn't explain the improvement in the official report's export orders sub-index. Here are some China-related quotes from the PMI reports:

China's Shanghai Composite is 1.5%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng is up 1.1%. Japan's Nikkei is up 1.0%. Korea's Kospi is up 0.5%. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX is down 0.1%. This comes in the wake of a lot of economic data. Of note, China's official manufacturing PMI unexpectedly climbed and South Korea's exports were stronger than expected.

AiGAustralia's commodities-driven economy surged when China's economy was accelerating and importing commodities like crazy. And now it's getting slammed with China's economy decelerating. "Make no mistake - the Australian tide is going to be heading way out as China is about to have what our economist Wei Yao described as its' Minsky moment', or in layman's terms, its day of reckoning!" warned Societe Generale strategist Albert Edwards. "But even before China suffers this 'moment', final demand in the commodity dependent Western Australia (WA) has fallen into recession. Earlier today, we got confirmation that things were still ugly in Australia. The country's manufacturing PMI tanked to 42.0 in July from 49.6 a month ago. Any reading below 50 signals contraction. "Manufacturers are telling us that, while the fall in the Australian dollar and the May interest rate cut have been extremely welcome, they have not yet been enough to turn around a very challenging business environment, locally and internationally," said the Australia Industry Group. Indeed, a major culprit continues to be slumping new orders and horrifically low exports (blame China). From the report (verbatim): The chart to the right shows how the new orders and exports sub-indices have crumbled.
Reuters/Mark BlinchThe Bank of England's monetary policy committee (MPC) will wrap up its monthly meeting Thursday morning.¬† Back in March, George Osborne, announced that the MPC should consider the use of forward guidance. Mark Carney's appointment as Bank of England Governor was just further evidence that more members of the MPC would be convinced to introduce forward guidance.¬† In the July MPC statement we received a strong hint that some form of guidance would be introduced in August. Societe Generale's Brian Hilliard points us to the key passage: "At its meeting today, the Committee noted that the incoming data over the past couple of months had been broadly consistent with the central outlook for output growth and inflation contained in the May Report. The significant upward movement in market interest rates would, however, weigh on that outlook; in the Committee‚Äôs view, the implied rise in the expected future path of Bank Rate was not warranted by the recent developments in the domestic economy. "The latest remit letter to the MPC from the Chancellor had requested that the Committee provide an assessment, alongside its August Inflation Report, of the case for adopting some form of forward guidance, including the possible use of intermediate thresholds. This analysis would have an important bearing on the Committee‚Äôs policy discussions in August." The MPC will discuss three policies at the meeting 1. Level of interest rates 2. Size of the quantitative easing program. 3. The possible introduction of forward guidance. While a change in any of these policies should be announced when the meeting concludes, Hilliard thinks the announcements on forward guidance are more likely to come during the August 7 inflation report, since Chancellor Osborne specifically requested it so. So tomorrow we're likely to only get statements on interest rates and QE. So what should the market expect on Thursday? Hilliard writes that when an announcement on forward guidance does come, it will be "state-contingent" guidance. "The fact that the Chancellor‚Äôs request was framed in terms of assessing the merits of using intermediate thresholds being reached for some particular economic indicator points to the ‚Äústate-contingent‚Äù approach being favored by the MPC." The consensus is that unemployment rate or nominal GDP growth are the top contenders for the choice of the threshold. Of course some economists have argued that the UK economy is already near escape velocity and more stimulus isn't necessary. While this could complicate discussions on the necessity of forward guidance, the thinking is nobody wants credit conditions to tighten too quickly, and forward guidance could help in that regard.
We just got the official and HSBC China PMI numbers, and both are painting different pictures of the nation's manufacturing sector. Official PMI climbed to 50.3 in July, beating expectations, while HSBC PMI fell to 47.7, in line with expectations. Bank of America's Ting Lu explains that the divergence in the official and HSBC Flash PMI readings could be driven by seasonal factors and the survey samples for each. The HSBC Flash PMI represents 85 - 90% of the respondents to the survey: "First, the decline of flash HSBC PMI, which was conducted in mid-July, was likely impacted by the prolonged pessimistic sentiment as a result of the interbank turmoil in June and the uncertainty regarding the new government's growth floor (or even worry of an engineered hard landing as part of the so called ìLi Keqiang Economicsî). However, since mid-July Premier Li has made it very clear that his government will try to achieve the 7.5% growth target with some policy easing measures including more investment in infrastructure FAI. So the official PMI survey which was conducted late July could be impacted by the more positive sentiment. "Second, the HSBC PMI sample is overly represented by small exporters which were hit by rising RMB, rising wage and sluggish global demand. However, the official PMI is more represented by domestic big enterprises with large exposure to FAI. The improved sentiment will surely support the official PMI." The other logical question that follows is which number investors should pay attention to. And Lu writes that we should focus on the official number, since the HSBC survey is more exposed to exporters, and "exports now only contribute 10% of China's GDP."

REUTERS/China DailyHSBC China manufacturing PMI fell to 47.7 in July, in line with expectations. This is down from 48.2 in June. Minutes earlier we got China's official PMI, which¬† beat expectations, rising to 50.3 in July, from 50.1 the previous month. Economists were expecting manufacturing to contract. HSBC Flash PMI which reflects the responses of 85 - 90% of those surveyed, fell to an 11-month low of 47.7. This spooked markets and showed the Chinese economic slowdown is deepening. Societe Generale analysts pointed out that the weakness in the Flash PMI was "broadly based, with four out of five major sub-indices deteriorating again." The employment sub-index in the Flash PMI report came in at 47.3 is at its lowest since early 2009. Here's a look at how China's manufacturing PMI has been shaping up: Markit Economics/HSBC
REUTERS/William HongOfficial Chinese manufacturing PMI climbed to 50.3 in July. This beat expectations for a decline to¬† 49.8, from 50.1 the previous month. Official manufacturing PMI last fell below the contractionary¬† level of 50 in September 2012. The employment index in the official PMI report has been below 50 for 14 straight months. Earlier this month, China announced that it was for now withholding industry specific data from the PMI report,on account that there isn't enough time to analyze the data. This will come as a relief to markets as concerns mount over China's economic slowdown. In a few minutes we will get HSBC China PMI that will give us a broader picture of the health of China's manufacturing sector.
Societe GeneraleSouth Korea's July trade report is out and the numbers look strong. Exports climbed 2.6% year-over-year, which was better than the 2.1% advance expected by economists. Economists across Wall Street dub South Korean exports as the global economic canary in the coal mine. Korean trade data¬†usually comes before the first trading session of the month in Asia, which makes it the first of the world's major economic indicators to be released. Since the yen-devaluing era of Abenomics began, however, Korean exports have been more volatile due to currency swings. "For H2 we also worry about the potential negative impacts of China‚Äôs slowdown on South Korea‚Äôs exports," said SocGen. "The US economic recovery would not fully offset the negative impacts from China given Korea‚Äôs increasing dependence on China-bound exports."

"Manufacturers are telling us that, while the fall in the Australian dollar and the May interest rate cut have been extremely welcom, they have not yet been enough to turn around a very challenging business environment, locally and internationally," said the Austrailia Industry Group. The production sub-index tanked to 37.7, down 12.5 point from July. The employment sub-index fell 4.2 points to 42.7. Meanwhile, the input price index surged to 70.9, up 14.5 points.

REUTERS/Carlos BarriaChina's Q2 GDP data confirmed the economic slowdown. And the decline in HSBC Flash PMI to an 11-month low of 47.7 showed the slowdown is deepening. China will release it's official PMI at 9 p.m. ET. Economists polled by Bloomberg are looking for manufacturing to slow to 49.8 in July, from 50.1 the previous month. If PMI falls below the contractionary† level of 50, this will be the first time it has done so since September 2012. This is followed by HSBC manufacturing PMI at 9:45 p.m. ET. Economists are looking for PMI to slide to 47.7, from 48.2. Societe Generale analysts point out that the weakness in the Flash PMI was "broadly based, with four out of five major sub-indices deteriorating again." The employment sub-index in the Flash PMI report came in at 47.3 is at its lowest since early 2009. The employment index in the official PMI report has been below 50 for 13 straight months. With China's excess capacity problems, we will also be watching the inventory of finished goods sub-index. Earlier this month China announced that it was for now withholding industry specific data from the PMI report, on account that there isn't enough time to analyze the data. Some have said the real reason for this move was the weakness of the data. The suspension of this data is however expected to make it more difficult for economists to analyze economic data that many consider unreliable.† China has been moving to restructure steel, aluminum, cement and other sectors that are burdened by excess capacity. And Chinese premier Li Keqiang has promised a 7.5% growth floor for 2013. But some continue to worry about a hard landing and investors will be watching this data closely.

For more visit Business Insider's new Wealth Advisor vertical. Advisors Shouldn't Single Out One Asset Class For Abuse (The Capital Spectator) Consensus is that emerging market growth is now slowing and that the good times in emerging market stocks are now over. But James Picerno at Capital Spectator writes that, "The truth is that we didnít wake up today and find that what had been an extraordinary investment opportunity last night had suddenly become dirt. The real story is that as the world has become increasingly globalized, and markets have become ever more securitized, expected return for the long run generally has inched down. This is almost certainly true for emerging market stocks, but itís no less relevant for the rest of the planetís equities (and bonds, real estate and commodities). ÖThe low hanging fruit of return has been picked." He also points out that expected returns are in "flux" in shorter periods and "diversification benefits will fade through time." "Over longer stretches, however, itís going to be tough to escape the terminal slide. In a world crawling with institutions armed to the teeth with computer-based quantitative strategies, searching through every nook and crevice of markets, the long, slow descent of risk premia will yield to financial gravity. That said, itís a mistake to focus on one piece of the major asset classes and single it out for abuse."  One Advisor Shows How Social Security Benefits Could Pay For College (The Wall Street Journal) Minor children of Social Security beneficiaries can receive as much as 50% of their payment, according to Fred Cornelius of Maryland-based Burt Wealth Advisors. Cornelius told The Wall Street Journal that one client in his 70s that earned about $250,000 and decided to adopt three young children with his new wife. Since they didn't need the extra money for their daily expenses, they invested the children's social security benefits in 529-college savings plans. "This client may not be alive by the time the children go to college and this allows them to set aside money for that purpose," Cornelius told the WSJ.

The ten picked this year are ones they expect to be "household names" in wealth management soon. We picked three and highlighted REP's reason for choosing them. 1. Deborah Fuhr, partner and co-founder of ETFGI. REP picks her as someone who can traverse the vast world of ETFs, identifying the "winners from the landmines." She previously spent three years as global head of ETF research at BlackRock. 2. Craig Pfeiffer, CEO of Advisors Ahead. The average age of advisors was 49 in 2012, according to Cerulli Associates and there's been a lot of chatter about ways to draw in new talent. "Thatís the dilemma Craig Pfeiffer is trying to solve. Being on the inside at Morgan Stanley for 29 years, Pfeiffer realized that traditional broker training programsówith their low success ratesówerenít cutting it," according to REP. 3. Janet Yellen, vice chairman of Fed Board of Governors. REP has nominated her because she is one of the top contenders for the chairman of the Fed.
China's economy is decelerating significantly. And its financial system is leveraged more than most emerging economies. This cocktail of risks have some experts worried that China's economy will land hard and spiral into a financial crisis. Unfortunately, historical precedent doesn't offer much comfort. "Sustained periods of high investment enabled Asian economies to achieve faster growth, but this has typically led to banking / foreign exchange crises," warn the economists at Deutsche Bank.¬† Here are two bullets from their recent "The House View" report: "China‚Äôs near 50% investment rate is far larger than other Asian economies during their take-off periods," they add. To be clear, a financial crisis is not Deutsche Bank's base case scenario.¬† But it's a scenario that's not totally unrealistic. Business Insider, Deutsche Bank

Scott Eells/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesEarlier today, CNBC reported that George Soros had amassed a large long position in Herbalifeóthe stock that's been at the center of a huge hedge fund war ever since Bill Ackman publicly announced that he's shorting it.† According to Fox Business Senior correspondent Charlie Gasparino, Ackman's lawyers are pressing the Securities and Exchange Commission to look at possible market manipulation around Soros' Herbalife investment. From Gasparino:† Sorosí investment represents less than 5% of outstanding shares of Herbalife or securities rules would have forced his fund to disclose the size of the position with the regulators. However, if his fund purchased shares in concert with other investors, or as a ìcommon group,î that could also prompt a filing of a shared position, securities lawyers say. No such filing has been made so far. Lawyers for Ackman are prodding the SEC to investigate whether such a shared position exists and whether the leaking of Soros' position constitutes stock manipulation, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Ackman, who runs Pershing Square, revealed late last year that he's shorting $1 billion worth of the stock because he believes it's a "pyramid scheme." † Since revealing his short, a number of hedge fund managers snapped up long stakes. †Ackman's arch-nemesis Carl Icahn bought a massive stake and said that Ackman would be the victim of the "mother of all short squeezes." † And now Soros has joined the side of fund managers going long the stock. †The stock closed up more than 9%.† Since Ackman confirmed his short position, shares of Herbalife have risen more than 41%.

EM currencies appreciated by an average of 1.5% and 2.0% a year from the end of 2002 to the end of April 2013 (depending on the basket and weighting methodology). Not a horrible outcome, but curiously tepid given that this happened†during the heyday of EM investing.† Letís take a closer look at the history of currency appreciation using the JP Morgan Emerging Local Markets Index Plus (ELMI+), which tracks total returns from investing in the short-term money markets of EM countries. Using the ELMI+ we constructed an index for the spot valuation of EM currencies versus the dollar. The results, shown below, are less than spectacular. Over the period in focus, EM currencies appreciated by about 17%, or roughly 1.5% annualized. But a large portion of the gain occurred during the first 24 months of the period. Also of interest is that the US Federal Reserveís policy of quantitative easing didnít boost EM currencies as much as other risky assets after the global financial crisis. AllianceBernsteinIs Economic Theory Wrong? Economic theory didnít go wrong, but it may have been misinterpreted. Theory states that faster real economic growth, if itís the result of better productivity growth, should cause real appreciation in EM currencies. The operative word is ìrealî and this is what gets lost in the discussion. Real exchange rates reflect the value of one countryís products in terms of anotherís, taking inflation into account. Real exchange rates are highly relevant to importers, exporters and multinationals, but for developed-market stock and bond investors the relevant measure is the nominal exchange rateósimply the value of one currency in terms of another† Looking at inflation differentials and estimates of real exchanges rates helps to confirm that the theory does work. Since 2003, the cumulative increase in EM consumer inflation has exceeded US inflation by over 37%. When added to the 17% nominal appreciation above, that implies a significant real appreciation (over 50%) in emerging country currencies. (The theory would use a different inflation measure, but you get the point.)† In an attempt to support the broad conclusion, we created†real and nominal effective EM exchange rate†indexes (REER and NEER) using Bank for International Settlements data. We used the countries in the ELMI+, but used a simple equally weighted approach.† We compared this index to a US dollar REER index in the chart below. According to†this methodology, the NEER of EM currencies has appreciated by about 19%†relative to†the US dollar, similar to the nominal appreciation calculated using the returns from the ELMI+. EM REER has appreciated by 39% versus the US dollarís REER, not nearly as drastic as the real appreciation seen by simply looking at inflation differentials, but still more than twice as much as the nominal relative appreciation. AllianceBernstein Implications for Investors† If appreciation has not played much of a role in passive EM currency returns to date, we donít see this changing in the foreseeable future. We think thereís some scope for nominal appreciation in EM currencies, but itís unlikely to be broad-based. There will be winners and losers.† In fact, there are signs that past appreciation has hurt some EM countriesí export competitiveness, EM economic growth has decelerated and few if any EM policymakers are eager for a stronger currency. In fact some are acting to stem further appreciation. The case for nominal appreciation in other currencies could be much stronger. Thus, active EM currency selection is vital for success in EM investing. To make the most of the opportunity, dedicated EM currency strategies and overlay strategies should allow longs and shorts of both EM and developed currencies.† Finally, investors should have a coherent currency view that is distinct from the bond and equity-selection decisions they are making. In fact, weíd hope that, going forward, bond and equity investors will think about each of the strands of EM investing on its own merits. By identifying the best country, currency, industry, yield curve and security allocations investors are more likely to arrive at efficient, well-diversified portfolios.
REUTERS/Gary CameronFederal Reserve Vice Chair Janet Yellen addresses the 29th National Association for Business Economics Policy Conference in Washington March 4, 2013.The Federal Reserve's latest FOMC statement is being interpreted as dovish by the bond market, which is rallying in the wake of the 2 PM release. Miller Tabak chief economic strategist Andrew Wilkinson says that with today's statement, the Fed is edging away from expectations that it will begin tapering the pace of its monthly bond purchases as soon as September. Wilkinson writes (emphasis added): Some subtle changes in the format of the ensuing policy statement and on balance it appears that the central bank has edged ever so slightly away from reducing bond purchases. However, when the FOMC last issued its statement it was what Bernanke said in the press conference that mattered. Today, there is no press conference and the sense that easy money is here to stay will likely permeate investor sentiment. The economy was described as expanding at a modest pace, which we read as a slight downgrade from the June 19 statement when it used the term ëmoderateí. Bernanke was firm in his assertion that future policy change would be data-dependent and the latest statement reflects that point by noting, ìmortgage rates have risen somewhat and fiscal policy is restraining economic growthî. Also suggesting the statement is tentatively backing away from tapering sooner-rather-than-later, is inclusion of heightened concern over the outlook for inflation. This likely accounts for why James Bullard voted with rather than against the committee this month. ìThe Committee recognizes that inflation persistently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance, but it anticipates that inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term.î "This is a remarkedly dovish statement in my view with the†absence of any tapering language,"†says Tom Di Galoma, head of fixed income rates sales at ED&amp;F Man Capital Markets. "However, the bond market still†has to contend with Friday's jobs report." Eric Green, global head of rates, FX, and commodities research at TD Securities, says that after the release of today's statement, "tapering [is] a go." "The precondition for tapering is for economic conditions to firm and the FOMC upgraded those expectations in paragraph 2 in stating that 'economic growth will pick up from its recent pace'," says Green. "That replaced language stating that economic growth will 'proceed at a moderate pace'. Strong signal that preconditions for tapering are being met."

When Chapman was on the way to his first finance job interview he got in a motorcycle accident. Banged up with a suit covered in glass and blood "gushing out" of him, Chapman still went in for his interview with Salomon Brothers. He ended up getting the job.

REUTERS/Price ChambersFederal Reserve Vice Chairman Donald Kohn walks with Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke (R) as they take a brief morning break at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium in Grand Teton National Park, August 27, 2010.Today, in a meeting with House democrats, President Obama reportedly defended former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers as a candidate to replace Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke when his term expires in January, saying that Summers' critics were not giving him a "fair shake." Based on ruminations from the White House, Summers is reportedly a frontrunner for the position, along with current Fed Vice Chair Janet Yellen. Aside from Summers and Yellen, there was apparently only one other name on the tip of Obama's tongue today: Donald Kohn. "Mr Obama also mentioned by name a third person, Don Kohn, a former Fed vice-chair, as a possible candidate to replace Ben Bernanke, who retires after two four-year terms in January next year," reports the FT's Richard McGregor. Kohn sat on the FOMC from 1987-2010, serving his last four years as Vice Chair.
REUTERS/Ho NewJanet Yellen sworn in as Federal Reserve board governor, October 4, 2010.The July FOMC statement is out. Everyone wants to know about the Federal Reserve's thoughts on inflation, which is stubbornly low. "The Committee recognizes that inflation persistently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance, but it anticipates that inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term," says the statement. Below is the full text of the release: Release Date: July 31, 2013 Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June suggests that economic activity expanded at a modest pace during the first half of the year. Labor market conditions have shown further improvement in recent months, on balance, but the unemployment rate remains elevated. Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, and the housing sector has been strengthening, but mortgage rates have risen somewhat and fiscal policy is restraining economic growth. Partly reflecting transitory influences, inflation has been running below the Committee's longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth will pick up from its recent pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. The Committee sees the downside risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as having diminished since the fall. The Committee recognizes that inflation persistently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance, but it anticipates that inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term. To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee decided to continue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. Taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative. The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months. The Committee will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability. The Committee is prepared to increase or reduce the pace of its purchases to maintain appropriate policy accommodation as the outlook for the labor market or inflation changes. In determining the size, pace, and composition of its asset purchases, the Committee will continue to take appropriate account of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases as well as the extent of progress toward its economic objectives. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens. In particular, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored. In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, Chairman; William C. Dudley, Vice Chairman; James Bullard; Elizabeth A. Duke; Charles L. Evans; Jerome H. Powell; Sarah Bloom Raskin; Eric S. Rosengren; Jeremy C. Stein; Daniel K. Tarullo; and Janet L. Yellen. Voting against the action was Esther L. George, who was concerned that the continued high level of monetary accommodation increased the risks of future economic and financial imbalances and, over time, could cause an increase in long-term inflation expectations.

via CNBCActivist investor Bob Chapman, who runs Manhattan Beach-based Chapman Capital, was on CNBC's "Halftime Report" with Scott Wapner moments ago talking about Herbalife and Bill Ackman. Chapman, who has been trading in and out of Herbalife for years, has a reputation for sending vitriolic letters to company boards. He has also had some choice words for Ackman in the past. "Making money when Bill Ackman is losing money is like a ride at the circus," he said during a telephone interview with CNBC. Chapman's price target today for Herbalife's stock is $75. However, he sees the stock going to $300. Chapman told Wapner that Herbalife constitutes one of the largest positions he holds in all of his accounts. In some of his accounts, it's over 50%, he said. †He reestablished his position in the nutrition supplement seller in the low $40s. As for Ackman's massive short, he says that he's not a guy who can surrender. "I truly believe that he has a poster of the movie "300" over his bed. He's not trained in the art of surrender." And then for Ackman's press release about Herbalife's earnings yesterday, he said "Oh these are good questions to be asking of JCPenney, not Herbalife." Ackman told CNBC earlier that he has not covered a single share. Back in December, Ackman, who runs $12 billion Pershing Square, publicly revealed that he's shorting more than 20 million shares of the stock. Since confirming his short, the stock has risen more than 41%. It's hitting 52-week highs today after it was reported that George Soros had amassed a sizeable long position.
Over the weekend, Tim Carney, one of the leading proponents of "libertarian populism," took issue with my contention that libertarian populists think "middle-class entitlements are unsustainable and must be constrained." He says that claim is unfounded. So I asked Carney what he thinks about the overall shape of the federal budget, and he told me this: @jbarro @TheStalwart Federal government is way too big right now. It should focus on defense and, maybe, safety net. He added that the safety net should be principally left to voluntary organizations and the states, with the federal government as a last resort. This approach has obvious public-finance problems (well, obvious to most people except libertarians): Demand for safety-net programs moves with the business cycle ó inversely to tax receipts ó so the ability to run a deficit is key to backing them, and the federal government is much better-positioned to do that than states are. But a slash-the-federal-entitlement-state view also just isn't populist. Federal entitlements protect the masses against problems like unemployment, retirement insecurity, and poverty. Seeking to dismantle them is the opposite of defending mass interests against elites. You can frame your desire to shrink these programs in terms of a desire to cut relatively regressive taxes like the payroll tax, as Carney does. But the progressivity that is lost by cutting entitlements is far greater than any that is gained by cutting regressive taxes. Carney then allowed this: @zackbeauchamp @jbarro I agree you couldn't quickly devolve without huge disruptions. What's funny about this idea is that when conservatives propose to add means tests to entitlement programs, liberals usually justify their opposition on the grounds that conservatives intend the means tests to undermine popular support for the programs by turning them into "welfare." Conservatives generally say that's nonsense. But Carney is being explicit about means-testing as a first, achievable step on the road to a much greater dismantling of the federal entitlement state. But what is perhaps most amazing about libertarian populists is how they believe their own rhetoric. To them, the federal government is an entity that taxes the poor to enrich the connected and powerful. Therefore, any effort to shrink the federal government is putting the people ahead of the powerful. And there are lots of federal programs that are about enriching the elite. But excluding the Department of Defense, the really expensive programs are either mostly about providing benefits to the poor (Medicaid, SNAP, SSI, disability insurance) or the middle class (Social Security old-age pensions, Medicare). So you can call for abolishing the Export-Import Bank and say as many things like this about Democrats as you want: @jbarro I would be aided by the fact that they're fighting to tax the poor and subsidize the rich, while preserving Big Gov't.

Yesterday, Detroit artist Jerry Vile installed a giant can of Crisco (for international readers, a cooking oil and occasional lubcricant) front of Robert Graham's iconic statue of Joe Louis' fist. Check it out: Jerry Vile Reached by phone, Vile said he preferred to let the piece speak for itself.  Unfortunately, authorities have already removed it.
For years Brazil, Russian, India and China were the world's emerging market darlings. But concerns have grown around each of these. In China, there is a fear of a hard landing. India's growth is at a 10-year low and the rupee has weakened exacerbating its woes. Brazil has also seen an economic slowdown and rising domestic discontent. And Russia's lackluster growth has disappointed markets and the economy minister has has had to step up and say a recession isn't likely. Now, the Philippines is getting some attention as the next it emerging market. Bloomberg BRIEF's Michael McDonough, who closely watches the ASEAN economies (The Association of Southeast Asian Nations), tweeted these three charts that show not only the benefits of strong demographics in the Philippines, but its growth trajectory too. Michael McDonough via Twitter Philippines' GDP forecasts have constantly been revised higher.

drugoi.livejournal.comGoldman Sachs was the subject of a recent piece in the New York Times detailing how the investment bank uses warehouses it owns to store aluminum for clients, augmenting revenue streams from its commodities operations by charging rent to store it. The piece alleges that the bank has intentionally stretched out the time it takes for clients to get their aluminum in order to charge more rent. Goldman has, of course, defended its actions. Today, though, Bloomberg's Michael J. Moore reports that Goldman has come up with a solution: Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said it's offering end-user clients a faster way to get metal that's in warehouses as the bank laid out proposals to address concerns about limited supply. The bank is contacting clients with an offer to swap their metal stuck in queues for immediately available aluminum, the New York-based firm said in a statement. Goldman Sachs also said consumers should be prioritized over other clients in getting aluminum out of the warehouses and called for more transparency in the London Metal Exchange system. Basically, it sounds like instead of telling clients that they have to wait for delivery of their aluminum because operators are having trouble finding specific orders in the stacks and stacks of metal contained in the warehouses, they're just going to start filling delivery requests with the stuff up front.
G.e.o.r.g.e via FlickrDon't worry about him. He's just a cost.If you watch TV, you'll be led to believe that the problem with the U.S. economy is that one political team or the other is ruining the country. A sharp drop in government spending this year is, in fact, temporarily hurting economic growth, but that's not the real problem. The real problem is that American corporations, which are richer and more profitable than they have ever been in history, have become so obsessed with "maximizing short-term profits" that they are no longer investing in their future, their people, and the country. This short-term corporate greed can be seen in many aspects of corporate behavior, from scrimping on investment spending to obsessing about quarterly earnings to fretting about daily fluctuations in stock prices. But it is most visible in the general attitude toward average employees. Employees are human beings. They are people who devote their lives to creating value for customers, shareholders, and colleagues. †And, in return, at least in theory, they share in the rewards of the value created by their team. In theory. In practice, American business culture has become so obsessed with maximizing short-term profits that employees aren't regarded as people who are members of a team.† Rather, they are regarded as "costs." And "costs," as we all know, are supposed to be reduced as much as is possible (except the "costs" of the salaries of senior management and investors ó those are supposed to be increased). This view of employees was expressed succinctly yesterday by a Twitter user named Daryl Tremblay, who was appalled by the suggestion that McDonald's should increase the wages of its restaurant workers and fund this by making a bit less money. (I was arguing that McDonald's employees should not be treated as "costs," but instead as valuable members of a successful team who shouldn't have to work that hard and still live in poverty.) Here was Daryl's take on employees: They are costs. Full Stop. They don't have a stake, they hold nothing. They trade their labor for money. ó Daryl Tremblay (@DarylT) July 30, 2013 Now, Daryl is hardly alone in this view. Most senior managers and owners of big American corporations think this way these days. They regard the human beings they work with ó the human beings who create the value that pays their salaries ó as "costs" to be reduced to create "maximized earnings." Because "maximized earnings," it is now frequently said, is the only thing that any business owner or manager should care about. Whenever you suggest to folks like Daryl that it doesn't have to be this way, that some companies can and do balance the interests of shareholders with the interests of customers and employees ó and, in so doing, create a symbiotic relationship that supports all of these constituencies ó folks like Daryl call you a "socialist." This is a strange insult, because the government has nothing to do with this. But, nevertheless, "socialist" is the label you get branded with if you suggest that the senior managers and owners of America's corporations should share more of their vast wealth with the employees who create it. This view of capitalism is that it is a sort of Lord-Of-The-Flies economic system in which the only consideration should be "every man for himself." In this style of capitalism, leaders do not manage teams and organizations in a way that creates value for everyone ó customers, shareholders, and employees. Rather, in this view of capitalism, a handful of winners extract as much value as they can from hapless losers who don't have the skills, knowledge, or time necessary to "demand a raise" or "go get a better job."†† It doesn't have to be this way. There is no capitalist law that says companies have to view employees as "costs" and pay them as little as possible. Senior managers and owners can choose to share more of a company's wealth with the people who generate it. They can choose to make only reasonable profits, while still generating compelling financial returns. And they can choose to pay their colleagues living wages instead of viewing them as "costs" and extracting every penny of value from them. If American corporations were struggling to earn money these days, we wouldn't be having this conversation. But they aren't. Business Insider, St. Louis FedAs this chart shows, American corporations have the highest profits and profit margins in history. American corporations can afford to pay their employees better, hire more employees, and invest more in their future and the country's future. But American corporations aren't doing that. Instead, American corporations are choosing†to divert as much of their value as possible to their owners and senior managers.† Doing this is not a law of capitalism. It's a choice. And it is a choice, unfortunately, that is destroying America's middle class, robbing American consumers (a.k.a., "employees") of spending power, and, ironically, hurting the growth of the same corporations that are making this choice. If your customers are strapped, your company can't grow. And, right now, American companies are choosing to impoverish their customers (employees), while skimming off as much wealth as possible for themselves.

Conditions have stopped worsening, and Europeís economy may be stabilizing after a period of rapid economic deterioration. However, the deep-rooted negatives that lie not far under the surface may disappoint those expecting steady improvement, much less a powerful rebound, following the back-to-back recessions of recent years. While unemployment and fiscal conditions highlight the deeply entrenched and hard-to-resolve problems facing the Eurozone, these indicators tend to lag a recovery and may stabilize if the economies actually begin to grow again. However, the lending situation suggests stabilization and a flat pace of growth may be more likely than a return to the 2<U+2009>ñ<U+2009>4% annualized growth rates that preceded the downturn. European stocks (MSCI Europe) have climbed 25% in dollars since one year ago on July 26, 2012, when ECB President Mario Draghi turned markets around when he said policymakers will ìdo whatever it takes to preserve the euro.î Over the past year, Spanish 10-year note yields fell to 4.6% from a euro-era record 7.5% the day before Draghiís speech. Likewise, Italian yields slid more than 2 percentage points. The ECBís efforts have made it easier for countries to borrow, but that has not extended to businesses or consumers. Lending to companies and households in the euro area has contracted over the past year. In the United States, banks have continued to ease lending standards each quarter, making it easier for borrowers to access credit. But the opposite remains true in the Eurozone. Although business loans are rising at a 7% rate in the United States and housing has been a key support for the U.S. economy, the demand for business loans in the Eurozone continued to slow in the second quarter and decelerated ìsubstantiallyî for housing loans. According to the ECBís report, banks expect loan demand to drop even further in the current quarter. Banking on the Banks Banksí willingness to lend is particularly important for Europeís economic outlook. In Europe, companies are more reliant on banks as sources of financing than in the United States. According to the European Banking Federation, about 75% of European business financing comes from banks, compared to 30% in the United States. And smaller businesses are particularly affected by a banking crisis because they rely even more heavily on bank lending to finance themselves than larger companies. According to ECB and EU data, in the Eurozone smaller-sized businesses have historically accounted for three-fourths of employment (and 85% of net new jobs) and generate 60% of economic value added, much higher than in the United States. Since the onset of the European financial crisis, smaller businesses have lacked financing to retain workers and have lost jobs faster than large companies. Therefore, the difficulties that small companies face in securing financing from banks that continue to make it harder to borrow dampen hopes of a rebound in the European economy. Banks may not become more willing to lend anytime soon. Banks are likely to continue to be cautious on lending and hoard capital due to an agreement, yet to be approved, that EU finance ministers reached a month ago over the rescue of troubled European banks. The new agreement establishes the hierarchy of who should pay first when a bank gets in trouble. First, shareholders and bond owners may be wiped out. Then depositors of more than 100,000 euros will suffer losses before governments step in with taxpayer money. This means banks must maintain capital buffers at all costs, since any trouble will prompt large depositors to fleeóleaving fewer funds available for lending and lessening the willingness to make riskier loans to smaller businesses. Stabilizing but Fragile  The upbeat surveys and statistics released last week suggest that economic growth is stabilizing in Europe. This is primarily the lagged result of the ECB reversing the upward spiral of interest rates and providing stimulus over the past year in addition to an easing of some of the austere budget targets in some countries. But record-high unemployment levels in Southern Europe and rising unemployment in core Northern European countries along with unwillingness by banks to lend and worsening fiscal conditions across the Eurozone all point to lingering stagnation. In addition, while potent at averting a crisis, monetary policy can do little to fix Europeís deeper structural faults, such as weak international competitiveness and low domestic demand from an aging population. While there is no longer any reason for dire predictions about Europeís economic future, neither is there reason for much optimism. Most countries in Europe will remain economically fragile, and flat-to-weak economic growth is likely to be the prominent trend. Alternatively, the United States is poised to see positive and accelerating economic growth in the second half of 2013. As we have all year, we continue to believe U.S. stocks will outperform their international peers.† LPL Financial
REUTERS/Yuriko NakaoBoys try out Nintendo's 3DS game software at an electronic store in Tokyo.SociÈtÈ GÈnÈrale global strategist Kit Juckes offers the perfect anecdote highlighting the real problem Japanese industry ñ and by extension, "Abenomics," the experimental program of economic stimulus launched by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe ñ faces. Japanese products like the Nintendo Wii still can't compete with the likes of Microsoft's popular Xbox console, even though they are less expensive. Juckes writes (emphasis added): I have no opinion about Nintendo's share price. But the Nintendo DS is being beaten into pulp by the fashion for mobile games. The WiiU likewise, and the Wii isn't competing with Xbox and [PlayStation]. All of this is a shame for those of us who wish our children would stick to cheaper devices. And for those of us who have lost iPads and smartphones to our teens. I approve of Nintendo on grounds of cost, even if it fails on 'cool'. The good news is that the yen saves the day!! Profits are up despite falling sales. Dear Mr. Nintendo, please bolster your sales by cutting prices in time for Christmas, and give me some of your weak yen in disinflation, I deserve it! Oh and please use some of your profits to think up other cooler (and cheaper) games that can compete with the leviathans of the mobile gaming and video market. Do I like what the yen has done for the Nikkei? Oh Yes I do! Does Mr. Abe need to keep it up if he wants to avoid wasting the benefit of a weaker currency? Yes he does! A rush of monetary stimulus from the Bank of Japan and fiscal stimulus from the Abe administration can help weaken the yen, making Japanese exports more attractive from a price standpoint. What those stimulus programs can't necessarily do is restore competitiveness to Japanese industry by making Japanese products "cool" again, which is why structural reforms aimed at transforming the Japanese business culture are of utmost importance.
REUTERS/Mario AnzuoniJanet L. Yellen (L) watches before being introduced on stage at the Town Hall Los Angeles forum in Los Angeles March 23, 2010.The biggest theme driving global markets in recent months has been the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will begin to taper back the pace of its monthly bond purchases later this year as the economy improves. Primary dealers of Treasuries on Wall Street expect the Fed to announce a tapering of purchases to $65 billion a month from the current rate of $85 billion a month at the September FOMC meeting. Today's ADP report on unemployment and the advance release of second quarter GDP both sent the bond market tumbling, suggesting that it is pricing in a greater chance that the Fed announces tapering soon. If that's the case, though, it could put the Federal Reserve in an awkward position when September rolls around ‚Äì provided that the tapering timeline is still on track ‚Äì because given the tepid pace of growth reported in today's GDP release, it will likely have to downgrade its economic projections. "In light of real GDP growing by only 1.4% at an annualized rate in the first half of 2013, it is unlikely that growth in the second half will be strong enough for the Fed's 2.3 to 2.6% real GDP growth projection to be realized," says Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius. "As a result, we would expect a downward revision to the Fed's 2013 growth forecast in the September Summary of Economic Projections." In order for the Fed to continue forecasting 2.3-2.6% real GDP growth in 2013, it must expect GDP to grow 3.2% in the second half of this year. Today's GDP release was only the first estimate of Q2 GDP data. It could get revised up or down next month before the September FOMC meeting.

Eliot Professor Lawrence Summers gestures while he speaks during The Economist's Buttonwood Gathering in New York on October 25, 2012.Amid growing liberal and Democratic opposition to the possibility of Larry Summers as chairman of the Federal Reserve, President Barack Obama gave a "full-throated defense" of him to a group of House Democrats in a closed-door meeting. Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.) told reporters†of Obama's defense. According to Bloomberg, Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.) said that Obama also told House Democrats that Summers has been "unfairly criticized."† Sherman also said Obama hasn't made a decision on the next Fed chair, but that he "took a minute to stand up for Larry Summers." Politico's Ben White reported today†that Summers is still the front-runner over Janet Yellen, who has become the popular choice of Congressional Democrats. In a press conference after the meeting, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said that a House member brought up Summers, upon which Obama launched into what she said wasn't a "defense" ó but an explanation of why he thought Summers had been treated unfairly recently.
Pamela Engel / Business Insider There are multiple reports of a white van on fire near the Flatiron building in New York City this morning. The blaze has since been extinguished and traffic is moving again around Madison Square Park, but 5th is closed off between 23rd and 24th. Firefighters and police still on scene and area around the van is roped off with crime scene tape. Some reports suggest the vehicle "exploded," but this is unconfirmed ‚Äî Shimon Prokupecz of NBC New York reports that officials say that the van just "caught fire." Police Officer Douglas Alston¬†told Business Insider, "The driver got out in time" and the vehicle was occupied at the time of the fire. Another police officer said there were no injuries except for one case of smoke inhalation. Gorka Hernandez, a passerby who was in the seating area across from Madison Square Park, said that maintenance workers evacuated the area just before the van exploded.¬† "Some gas started getting under the car and there was a flame under the car,"¬†Hernandez said. "They started screaming, 'get out, get out!'" Wilson Jimenez, a sanitation worker with the Flatiron 23rd St Partnership, said he noticed the van was leaking and that there were sparks, so he first ran to tell the driver to get out. "There were people just sitting down and a school field trip was walking by," Jimenez told Business Insider. "When people saw the flames they ran." This video from Instagram user @ShannonAMay shows the scene:  May tells Business Insider that Grey Advertising Agency, located by the fire at 200 5th Ave, has asked all employees to move from the 5th Ave side of the building.

REUTERS/Yuri GripasCNBC's Scott Wapner breaks the news that legendary hedge fund manager George Soros has taken a long position in Herbalife, according to sources familiar.¬† According to Wapner, Herbalife is one of Soros' top three holdings. Herbalife's stock is ripping on the news. ¬†It hit a 52-week high of $66.26, but is now trading off those highs. ¬† Herbalife, a multi-level marketing firm that sells nutrition products, has been at the center of an epic¬†clash of hedge fund titans¬†full of drama. Bill Ackman, who runs $12 billion Pershing Square Capital Management, publicly revealed late last year that he's shorting $1 billion worth of Herbalife stock. ¬† During a 342-slide presentation at a special Sohn Conference, Ackman slammed the company calling it a¬†"pyramid scheme"¬†that targets lower income people. ¬†Ackman, who has a $0 price target, believes that regulators, specifically the Federal Trade Commission, will be induced to investigate Herbalife.¬† Shortly after Ackman presented short thesis, rival fund manager Daniel Loeb of Third Point amassed a sizeable position, which he exited for a nice profit in the second quarter. Loeb, who has a reputation for his strongly worded letters and emails, recently left a taunting message directed at Ackman on his Bloomberg Terminal about an "Herbalife Enema, administered by Uncle Carl".¬† Ackman's nemesis, billionaire investor Carl Icahn, bought a massive stake in Herbalife. Icahn thinks Ackman will be the victim of the¬†"mother of all short squeezes." And now we have Soros, who reportedly asked to pull hundreds of millions of dollars from Ackman's Pershing Square earlier this year, taking a long position in the company. ¬†(Fun fact: Ackman and Soros actually work in the same building at 888 Seventh Avenue.) So far, Ackman has lost an estimated $300 million since putting on his Herbalife short, according to Reuters reporter Katya Wachtel citing sources familiar.¬† CNBC's Maneet Ahuja reported earlier today that Ackman hasn't covered a single share of Herbalife.¬† Since December 18, the trading session before Ackman confirmed his short, the stock has risen more than 41%.

Now it could be home to America's burgeoning tech companies and their hipster employees. "Wall Street" has bucked Wall St. for surrounding areas in recent years. Hedge funds prefer the Midtown 50s or Stamford and Greenwich, Connecticut (affectionately dubbed¬†Hedgefundistan). Goldman Sachs built another tower in nearby Jersey City. The financial crisis didn't help either. Bank of America acquired Merrill Lynch and will ditch much of its office space when the lease expires, according to Bloomberg. In fact, Bloomberg reports that consolidating financial companies have left 6.3 million square feet of office space to fill, about 7% of the lower Manhattan office market. Naturally landlords are giving the area a makeover, hipsterfying FiDi into a destination for media and tech companies. From Bloomberg: Brookfield is stripping away brass and marble trims and adding bicycle parking, free Wi-Fi in public spaces and electric-car charging stations. At Merrill‚Äôs former headquarters, clear glass is replacing the imposing, dark-tinted facade built as a barrier to the public... At $47.13 a square foot, the Downtown Manhattan has the lowest rents (in addition to the most open space) in Manhattan's three major divisions. Midtown south (encompassing Chelsea, the Flatiron District, and Soho) averaged $63.44 a square foot, according to Bloomberg. At those prices, FiDi could look a lot different, and soon.
REUTERS/Toru HanaiThe debate over who should be named the next chairman of the Federal Reserve, Janet Yellen or Larry Summers, continues to heat up.¬† Veteran economist David Rosenberg has come out with a glowing endorsement for Yellen. In his latest Breakfast with Dave report, he writes that when she was president of the San Francisco Fed, Yellen was one of the only ones who saw the crisis coming.¬† "Imagine if the leadership at the Fed would have heeded her warnings instead of lining up at the Kool-Aid stand. She deserves the head job just based on this alone, let alone her CV, which, frankly, is much more applicable to the Fed Chairman role than that of Larry Summers, who was has the grand total of zero experience in the realm of monetary policy decision-making. Yellen does, and at the highest level. "See her musings ‚Ä¶at those FOMC meetings when she took on her colleagues over the housing bubble (the one that Greenspan and Bernanke never saw) ‚Äî plus she absolutely nailed the recession call in late 2007, a time when almost every economist on Wall Street was publishing about 'soft landings'." Here are some warnings from Yellen back in 2007. We've drawn on the sections that Rosenberg emphasized: FOMC meeting (March 20 - 21, 2007) "As we discussed in detail two years ago, an asset price bubble inevitably leads to unsustainable imbalances in the economy and a misallocation of resources. The extraordinary run-up in house prices in recent years led to construction and sales booms that couldn't last." FOMC meeting (June 27 - 28, 2007) "In terms of risks to the outlook for growth, I still feel the presence of a 600-pound gorilla in the room, and that is the housing sector. The risk for further significant deterioration in the housing market, with house prices falling and mortgage delinquencies rising further, causes me appreciable angst." FOMC meeting (August 7, 2007) "In terms of risk to the outlook for growth, the housing sector obviously remains a serious concern. We seem to be repeatedly surprised with the depth and duration of the deterioration in these markets, and the financial fallout from developments in the subprime markets, which I now perceive to be spreading beyond that sector, is a source of appreciable angst." FOMC meeting (December 11, 2007) "My modal forecast foresees the economy barely managing to avoid recession, with growth essentially zero this quarter and about 1 percent next quarter. I expect growth to remain below potential throughout the next year, causing the unemployment rate to rise to about 5 percent, much like in the Greenbook. ...I should emphasize that I do not place a lot of confidence in this forecast, and in particular, I fear that we are in danger of sliding into a credit crunch. Such an outcome is illustrated by the credit crunch alternative simulation in the Greenbook."

Nobel prize winning economist Milton Friedman would've turned 101-years-old today. And there are plenty of people who would've loved to have him around today to witness how the Federal Reserve is running monetary policy. Friedman, who is famous for his ideas on monetarism, was against the idea of a Federal Reserve.† However, he did support the expansion of money supply. Last year, we featured this 1979 interview with a young Phil Donahue, and we bring it to you again. Donahue challenged Friedman on the principles of capitalism, and he specifically went after the concept of greed. But Friedman's eloquent response has gone down as one of the finest defenses of capitalism of all time. "But it seems to reward not virtue as much as it does the ability to manipulate the system," said Donahue. "And what does reward virtue?" asked Friedman rhetorically. "Does a communist commissary reward virtue? You think a Hitler rewards virtue?" "The record of history is absolutely crystal clear," he said. Watch the whole clip here.

U.S. economic growth for the second quarter was 1.7%. That's better than expected, but only because the expectations were so low. In absolute terms, for an economy in mid-recovery, 1.7% is a lousy growth rate. And growth in the first quarter was revised down to a pathetic 1%. If you turn on the TV today, you'll see a parade of our elected representatives blaming each other for this. You can mostly ignore them. If you're curious who is actually responsible for our crappy economy, just look at the following charts. But, first, a basic economic equation.†Ignoring imports and exports (for simplicity), the size of our economy is the sum of the following parts: PERSONAL CONSUMPTION (Consumer Spending) + PRIVATE INVESTMENT (Business Investment) + GOVERNMENT SPENDING Right now, those three buckets of spending are adding up to a meh GDP number. So which one is to blame? Well, first let's look at the biggest component of GDP--Personal Consumption (consumer spending). Personal Consumption these days is a higher-than-average ~71% of GDP. Importantly, personal consumption has stayed at about that level for the last several years. It's actually higher than it was from 2000-2007 and much higher than it was in the halcyon days of the 1990s. So if we're wondering who to blame for our crappy economy, we can't blame American consumers. Despite high unemployment and lousy wage growth, consumers are still spending. Business Insider, St. Louis Fed So, how about government spending? Is the government doing its part? Well, here we're going to find one of the big culprits. Unlike consumer spending, total government spending (federal, state, and local) has dropped sharply as a percent of GDP--from 39% of GDP a few years ago to only 35% today. This drop in government spending is acting as a big drag on GDP growth. Business Insider, St. Louis Fed But our government--the Republicans, mostly--have declared that it is crucial that we cut government spending. Republicans insist that we have to take our medicine now (while a Democratic president can be blamed for it) or die in agony later. And Democrats are unable to persuade enough Americans that this is a mistake. So we're stuck with government spending cuts, at least for this year. So that leaves the third category of GDP--business investment. How are businesses doing? Are they investing aggressively in their future and our country? Hell, no! If you're looking for the real group to blame for our crappy GDP, you've found it: American corporations. American corporations have become so greedy and short-term focused that they're barely investing at all. Don't believe it? Here's a look at private investment as a percent of GDP: Business Insider, St. Louis Fed American business investment has increased since the depths of the recession, but it is still at a level that is normally only seen in recessions (e.g., pathetic). So, why is it that American businesses aren't investing? Well, if you listen to some of the people on TV, they'll tell you that it's the result of "policy uncertainty" or "high taxes" or "too much regulation." This might sound persuasive, but it is self-serving nonsense. The real reason American corporations aren't investing is that the folks who control and run them have become so selfish and greedy that they are focused on only one thing: Maximizing short-term profitability. When the folks who control and run American corporations get together to set future goals, for example, they don't agree to, say, hire and invest heavily for the next several years in order to produce higher earnings and stock prices 5-10 years from now. In a business and investment culture ruled by annual bonuses and quarterly earnings reports, 5-10 years from now is so far into the future that it's barely worth considering. †Instead, the folks who control and run American corporations set annual bonus and quarterly earnings targets designed to maximize profits and stock prices today. In a period in which economic growth is weak (because corporations aren't investing), the way to hit annual profit targets and get those bonuses is to "increase efficiency." And "increasing efficiency," everyone knows, is usually just a synonym for cutting costs, firing employees, and scrimping on investment. So big American corporations are maximizing their profits and letting mountains of cash build up on their balance sheets while, in the process, starving the economy and their employees of cash that would otherwise turbo-charge consumer spending and economic growth. Don't believe it? Think that "too much regulation" and "too high taxes" are really to blame? Take a look at these charts, which we also published yesterday. CHART ONE: Corporate profits and profit margins are at an all-time high.†American companies are making more money and more per dollar of sales than they ever have before. Full stop. This means that the companies have oceans of cash to invest. But they're not investing it. Because they're too risk averse, profit-obsessed, and short-term greedy. Business Insider, St. Louis Fed CHART TWO: Wages as a percent of the economy are at an all-time low. Why are corporate profits so high? One reason is that companies are paying employees less than they ever have as a share of GDP. And that, in turn, is another reason the economy is so weak. Those "wages" represent spending power for American consumers. American consumer spending is revenue for other companies. So the profit maximization obsession of American corporations is actually starving the rest of the economy of revenue growth. Business Insider, St. Louis Fed CHART THREE: Fewer Americans are employed than at any time in the past three decades.†Another reason corporations are so profitable is that they don't employ as many Americans as they used to. This is in part because companies today regard employees as "costs" and "inputs" instead of human beings who are dedicating their lives to the organizations that, in turn, are supporting them and their families. (Symbiosis! Imagine that!) As a result of frantic firing in the name of "efficiency" †and "return on capital," the U.S. employment-to-population ratio has collapsed. We're back at 1970s-1980s levels now.†Business Insider, St. Louis Fed CHART FOUR: The share of our national income that American corporations are sharing with the people who do the work †("labor") is at an all-time low. †The rest of our national income, naturally, is going to owners and senior managers ("capital"), who have it better today than they have ever had it before. Business Insider, St. Louis Fed, Bureau of Labor Statistics In short, the obsession with "maximizing short-term profits" that has developed in America over the past 30 years has created a business culture in which executives dance to the tune of short-term traders and quarterly earnings reports, instead of investing aggressively on behalf of employees, customers, and long-term owners. That's not what has made America a great country. It is not what has made some excellent American corporations the envy of the world. It's also, importantly, not the way it has to be. Want an example of a corporation that can thrive--and deliver enormous returns to its shareholders--while ignoring short-term profitability and investing aggressively for the long-term? Amazon. Here's a chart of Amazon's revenue and profits over the past ~15 years. Business Insider/Ben Evans As you can see, unlike almost every other major American corporation, Amazon has invested aggressively almost every year that it has been in business. Amazon has invested so aggressively, in fact, that it has earned almost nothing. And yet... Amazon has become the dominant global eCommerce company, and it is growing at an extraordinary rate. And, just as important, Amazon's stock keeps hitting new all-time highs. Read that again. Amazon has traded off near-term profits for long-term investment for as long as it has been in business. It has been the target of ridicule by myopic and greedy short-term investors who want it to deliver "blowout quarters" and "upside surprises." It has ignored the screams of everyone who has ever said it "couldn't make money" or "doesn't make enough money." Instead, for more than 15 years now, Amazon has calmly, quietly, and aggressively invested in the future. And it has delivered extraordinary returns to long-term investors in the process. One of the big reasons the U.S. economy sucks is that, after three decades of ever-more obsessive focus on "shareholder value," our corporations and their owners have become myopic and greedy. Instead of investing in the future, and sharing more of their vast wealth with the people who generate it (their employees), they are hoarding their cash and maximizing their short-term profitability. This business philosophy might--might--prop up their stock prices for the near-term. But it's also gutting the middle class and crippling the overall economy. And, in the process, ironically, it is constraining revenue growth for the same corporations that are trying to scrimp and save their way to maximized profitability. It's time for Americans to rethink our current business philosophy. Coming out of the malaise of the 1970s and early 1980s, we needed a "get tough" period in which we got our corporations in shape. But now we've taken this "return on capital" religion too far. And it's hurting the country. Specifically, it's time to make the goal of our corporations be to create long-term value for all of their constituencies (customers, employees, and shareholders), not just short-term profits.
CNBC Filmmaker Spike Lee just wrapped up a great and testy interview on CNBC where he was talking about his new film, which he is financing on Kickstarter, the popular crowdfunding site. The highlight of the interview was this exchange between Spike and host Simon Hobbes. Twitter At another point during the interview he said that he's been doing Kickstarter since "before there was Kickstarter" meaning, presumably, he's always financed his movies unconventionally. Watch the video below: 
The nation is captivated by Anthony Weiner ó his plucky refusal to quit (sexting), the cringeworthy press conferences he gives, his intern who wrote a tell-all column for the Daily News, and his flack who called that†intern a "slutbag" in a conversation with a reporter. All of that also means he's not going to become mayor of New York. So, Business Insider thought it would be helpful to give you a little guide to the people who might actually win the New York City mayoral race, what they stand for, and who supports them. We think the most likely candidate to win is former city comptroller Bill Thompson (D). If you don't know much about him, you're not alone. An early July Quinnipiac poll found that less than half of likely Democratic primary voters were prepared to express an opinion about him.†Thompson will probably win because, unlike most of the other candidates, few voters can come up with a reason to hate him. But City Council Speaker Christine Quinn (D) and Public Advocate Bill De Blasio (D) all stand decent chancesóand you shouldn't entirely count out ex-deputy mayor Joe Lhota (R), since the last five mayor races have been won by the candidate on the Republican line. Here's the guide: Mike Nudelman/Business Insider

A billionaire Saudi prince has been ordered by the high court to pay $10m (¬£6.5m) in commission to a British-based Jordanian woman for selling his luxurious private jet to Colonel Muammar Gaddafi. Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud, who owns the Savoy hotel in London, had given evidence in court playing down Daad Sharab's role in the $120m deal with the former Libyan leader in 2005. The prince disputed her claim that any agreement was made for a "specific commission", saying she would have been paid at his discretion. He decided not to reward her because during the protracted sale she had "moved to the Libyan camp". In his judgment, Mr Justice Peter Smith explained that the dispute turned on whose evidence he accepted. Both Sharab and Al-Waleed appeared in person but the judge said he had "overwhelmingly concluded" that he preferred Sharab's account. The ruling is an embarrassment for the prince, who is a nephew of Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah. The prince has already attracted media attention by suing Forbes magazine in London over an article published alongside its coveted rich list, which he claims underestimated his fortune by $9.6bn (¬£6.1bn). He claims he is worth $30bn. Through his Kingdom Holding Company, Al-Waleed owns significant stakes in Citigroup, News Corp and Apple, among other companies. As well as the Savoy in London, he is also the owner or part-owner of the Plaza hotel in New York and the George V hotel in Paris. Sharab, 52, said after the ruling: "Today's decision has reinforced my belief in the fairness and impartiality of the English courts. I feel a great sense of relief ‚Ä¶ and thank Mr Justice Peter Smith for drawing a line under what has been a stressful seven years of litigation. "However, it will be extremely disappointing if the prince fails to accept the decision of this court and yet again attempts to delay payment of the agreed fee of $10m." She was represented by Clive Freedman QC and Richard Waller at TLT Solicitors. Her daughter, Noor Allawy, said: "I hold Saudi Arabian citizenship and I am proud to be Saudi Arabian. However, it has been very sorrowful to see a Saudi Arabian prince fighting with my mother for seven years and standing against her in court." The customised Airbus A340 at the centre of the dispute was fitted with a double bed, silver leather sofas and a whirlpool bath. It became a symbol of the Libyan dictator's private opulence and was put on display by rebel fighters after they captured it at Tripoli airport in 2011. The court was told that Sharab was initially contacted by the prince from Cannes in August 2001. He informed her that he had two aircraft, an Airbus ‚Äì built in 1996 and purchased from the Brunei government ‚Äì and a Boeing 767, both of which he wanted to sell. Later that month she met an accountant who was said to be his personal representative at Ayoush restaurant in Marylebone. Sharab said that the following year she was instructed by the prince to begin negotiations. She set about arranging an audience with Gaddafi, whom she had known since meeting him at a business conference in Tripoli in the late 1980s. Sharab said that in April 2003 she flew to Libya and was present when Al-Waleed and Gaddafi met. Both planes had been delivered and Gaddafi chose the Airbus. She testified: "The prince told me that if I could sell the aircraft for between $100m and $110m, he would pay me the $2m commission (which had been agreed previously) but that if I was able to negotiate a sale at above $110m, I could keep anything above that $110m." In the end Gaddafi agreed to pay $120m. The final payment did not reach the Saudi prince until 2006. Sharab, who lives for part of the year in the UK, said she had received $500,000 commission from Al-Waleed for a previous deal. Gaddafi subsequently fitted out the aircraft in the colours of his Afriqiyah Airways, and it became known as Afriqiyah One. It had red and grey carpets and nightclub-style spotlights on the ceiling. In 2009 the personalised jet was used to collect the convicted Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, who was ill and had been released on compassionate grounds from prison in Scotland. It was also used by Gaddafi's son, Saif al-Islam, on jaunts around the world. Shortly before the case was originally due to be heard in 2010, Sharab visited Libya again. This time, after falling out with Gaddafi, she was arrested and held in a private compound. When Nato began bombing Tripoli in support of the uprising against Gaddafi's regime in 2011, she was transferred to prison. Eventually she was freed by rebels and allowed to leave the country. Returning to London, she had the case relisted. This article originally appeared on guardian.co.uk 
Flickr via sillyshoestringA federal jury recently awarded an Oregon woman $18.6 million over Equifax because of errors on her credit report. Her issue: she had a credit file that was mixed with that of another woman, who happened to have poor credit. So, what is a mixed credit report and how do you avoid this happening to you? If youíve got a common name, like ìJulie Millerî (the name of the woman in Oregon who sued Equifax), thereís a chance that your credit report could be confused with another consumer with the same name. Itís not enough to have a different date of birth or a different address or a different Social Security Number. Mixed credit reports, which are not very common but are very difficult to get permanently corrected, are caused when the credit bureau places information belonging to another consumer on your credit reports, and then delivers that report to a lender. If the ìotherî consumer has poor credit then the lender will consider that itís yours and could deny you as a result. And, credit scoring systems cannot distinguish between your credit data and credit data belonging to another personÖso they will consumer and ìscoreî the information even if itís incorrect. The credit reporting agencies are under no obligation to proactively investigate the information on your credit reports to determine if itís yours or if it belongs to another person with the same name.† You have to pull your own credit reports, review the information and then file a formal dispute with the credit bureaus if you find data that you believe is incorrect or belongs to someone else. In the case of Miller v Equifax, Ms. Miller filed multiple disputes over a 2 year period and provided her identification information several times but still could not get her credit file segregated from that of another consumer. She was denied a line of credit as a result of collections on her credit report. And for those of you who are new to the credit report gameÖthatís what some people might call ìdamage.î In my work as an expert witness (140+ cases as of this week) mixed files cases do not come up often and when they do itís rare that that Plaintiff (a consumer) has an otherwise clean credit report. As such, itís harder to argue that the consumer/Plaintiff has been damaged solely as a result of her mixed report data because thereís a chance he or she would have been denied credit anyway as a result of the negative and accurate information that was on the credit report. The reason mixed files are so hard to correct is because the lender isnít sending in incorrect information.† So, they cannot fix the problem because theyíre not causing it. The problem is being caused by the credit bureau inadvertently co-mingling data belonging to two consumers and placing it on one credit report. There is a simple way to correct this issue. The credit bureaus can suppress or mask the allegedly incorrect information. This causes it to be removed from the credit report AND it blocks it from being re-added down the road.

Mike Powell/Getty ImagesThe results of the July Chicago PMI survey are out. The headline index rose to 52.3 from last month's 51.6 reading, failing to reach the 54.0 level predicted by economists. The index has been volatile recently. The index surged to 58.7 in May from 49.0 before falling back down to 51.6 in June. Below is the full text of the release: The Chicago Business Barometer increased to 52.3 in July from 51.6 in June, led by gains in Order Backlogs and Supplier Deliveries, more than offsetting a second consecutive monthly decline in both Production and New Orders. While still in contraction, Order Backlogs rose in July following a record plunge in June but remain below the average seen over the past year. Supplier delivery times moved back above 50 in July having fallen to a four year low in June. The remaining three Business Activity measures which make up the Barometer fell between June and July. Production and New Orders declined to the lowest since April, while Employment eased slightly, but remained above the long-run average.¬†Inventories continued to contract and were at their lowest since November 2009. Prices Paid rose for the third consecutive month to the highest since late 2012. Commenting on the MNI Chicago Report, Philip Uglow, Chief Economist at MNI Indicators said: ‚ÄúWhile the Chicago Business Barometer ticked higher in July, declines in both Production and New Orders show just how challenging the business environment is.‚Äù Click here for the full release &gt;
REUTERSThe Federal Reserve concludes its 2-day long Federal Open Market Committee meeting this afternoon. JP Morgan's Michael Feroli noted that the Fed's post-meeting statement would likely get tweaks for today's GDP report, which would leave them 5 1/2 hours to make their final edits. As we now know, Q2 GDP crushed expectations growing at a 1.7% rate. While, the Q1 growth rate was revised lower, that effectively made the upward trajectory of growth much stronger. "Confounding expectations, US real GDP growth actually accelerated from 1.1% annualised in the first quarter to 1.7% in the second, suggesting that the recovery is gaining momentum and, at the margin, probably strengthening the Fed's resolve to begin tapering its monthly asset purchases in September," noted Capital Economics' Paul Ashworth. On top of all of this, the ADP jobs report for July beat expectations, and the June numbers were revised upward. The Fed publishes its FOMC announcement at 2:00 p.m. ET today. We'll cover it live at BusinessInsider.com.
It looks like the Treasury market is taking the threat of a September tapering of bond purchases by the Federal Reserve more seriously this morning after two better-than-expected economic data releases. Right now, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note is 8 basis points higher at 2.69%, the highest level in weeks. ADP's monthly employment report, released at 8:15 AM, estimated that 200,000 private payrolls were created in the U.S. economy in the month of June. Economists were only looking for 180,000. The first reading of Q2 GDP, out at 8:30, revealed that the economy expanded 1.7% at an annualized pace in the second quarter. The number topped the consensus estimate of 1.0% growth. Treasuries sold off sharply on both releases. Since, the market has stabilized a bit, but is starting to roll over again. Now, the market is on track for its biggest down day since the sell-off following the last jobs report release on July 5. Friday, we get the next jobs report, so the fireworks could continue depending on the outcome. The chart below shows 5-year U.S. Treasury futures. Thinkorswim
Dell's special committee just rejected CEO Michael Dell's offer to raise his bid for the company to $13.75 a share in exchange for a voting rule change, CNBC's David Faber reports. What that means is that Carl Icahn chances for gaining control of the company just shot up. The last two votes were canceled because of lower than expected turnout among shareholders. The rule Michael Dell and his group wanted to change was the counting of those absentee votes as "no" votes. Around 23% of shareholders didn't vote on the deal last time, according to WSJ, which was a big blow to the CEO's side. Now it looks like those absentees are going to remain "nays" ó good news for Carl Icahn.
Flickr / Sean GanannThe first estimate of Q2 GDP is out, and the numbers were much stronger than expected. GDP grew at a 1.7% annualized rate, which was much stronger than the 1.0% expected by economists. This was largely driven by personal consumption, which climbed by 1.8%.† Economists were only expecting a 1.6% gain. "Second quarter growth was supported by a 1.8% gain in consumption, down only slightly from a 2.3% gain in the first quarter," said Capital Economics Paul Ashworth."Together, those increases suggest that households have coped well with higher taxes." Indeed, many feared that higher payroll taxes, which came with last year's fiscal cliff dealing, would crush the consumer. That just hasn't been the case.
Core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) data in today's GDP release showed that inflation fell to 0.8% in the second quarter of 2013 from an upward-revised 1.4% in the first quarter. The lowest level on record for Core PCE inflation is 0.7%. That was in the first quarter of 2009, in the fallout of the financial crisis and the ensuing recession. Core PCE also touched 0.7% twice in the early 1960s, which is about as far back as the data go. Core PCE also hit 0.8% in the fourth quarter of 2010, but rebounded after that to 2.3% in the second quarter of 2011. Since then, it's been trending down. This measure of inflation is closely watched by the Federal Reserve, and it could lend credence to the argument that the Fed remain accommodative for longer. The central bank has said it will not raise short-term interest rates before inflation hits 2.5% and unemployment falls to 6.5%. Business Insider/Matthew Boesler, data from Bloomberg
REUTERS/Jo Yong HakIn an effort to "modernize" its account, the Bureau of Economic Analysis today revised GDP figures dating back to 1929¬†‚Äî something it does about every 5 years. Definitional and accounting changes meant that in 2012, for example, the level of current-dollar GDP was bumped up $559.8 billion. From the BEA, here is a summary of the revisions made:

This morning we got two pieces of data, both of which were decent. The ADP Jobs Report (which is a private survey designed to anticipate the official jobs report, which comes out Friday) beat expectations, The report said that private companies added 200,000 new jobs in July. Meanwhile, the GDP report for Q2 came in at 1.7%, well ahead of the 1.0% that was expected. But then, Q1 was revised down sharply. The GDP report ‚Äî because it's GDP ‚Äî will get all the headlines. But the real story is ADP today. ADP is frequently mocked for being "wrong" because on a month-to-month basis it doesn't always align that nicely with the official number. But here's what matters. The ADP report confirms that the economy in recent months has shifted to a faster clip of job creation, as not only did we get 200,000 new jobs this time, but we got 198,000 last month. If you look at the last few months of official, Non-Farm Payroll data, you can see that we've been steadily hitting the 200k mark in monthly job creation, which is above where we were in years prior. FRED Of course, one month of ADP doesn't tell the whole story, and Friday's number could be a whiff, but today's report strongly confirms this new consistent level of job creation, and that's what matters to both real people (who care about jobs, not GDP) and the Fed, which is focused on strong job creation.
The first look at Q2 U.S. GDP from the Bureau of Economic Analysis is out. Growth was 1.7% at an annualized rate in the second quarter.¬† Economists expected GDP to rise only 1.0% in Q2. Q1 GDP growth was revised down to 1.1% from 1.8%. Personal consumption growth slowed to 1.8% in Q2 from a downward-revised 2.3% in Q1, also beating economists' consensus estimate of 1.6% growth. Below is the full text of the release: Real gross domestic product -- the output of goods and services produced by labor and property¬†located in the United States -- increased at an annual rate of 1.7 percent in the second quarter of 2013¬†(that is, from the first quarter to the second quarter), according to the "advance" estimate released by the¬†Bureau of Economic Analysis. In the first quarter, real GDP increased 1.1 percent (revised). The Bureau emphasized that the second-quarter advance estimate released today is based on¬†source data that are incomplete or subject to further revision by the source agency (see the box on page 3¬†and "Comparisons of Revisions to GDP" on page 18). The "second" estimate for the second quarter,¬†based on more complete data, will be released on August 29, 2013. The increase in real GDP in the second quarter primarily reflected positive contributions from¬†personal consumption expenditures (PCE), exports, nonresidential fixed investment, private inventory¬†investment, and residential investment that were partly offset by a negative contribution from federal¬†government spending. Imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, increased. The acceleration in real GDP in the second quarter primarily reflected upturns in nonresidential¬†fixed investment and in exports, a smaller decrease in federal government spending, and an upturn in¬†state and local government spending that were partly offset by an acceleration in imports and¬†decelerations in private inventory investment and in PCE. ... The price index for gross domestic purchases, which measures prices paid by U.S. residents,¬†increased 0.3 percent in the second quarter, compared with an increase of 1.2 percent in the first.¬†Excluding food and energy prices, the price index for gross domestic purchases increased 0.8 percent in¬†the second quarter compared with 1.4 percent in the first. Real personal consumption expenditures increased 1.8 percent in the second quarter, compared¬†with an increase of 2.3 percent in the first. Durable goods increased 6.5 percent, compared with an¬†increase of 5.8 percent. Nondurable goods increased 2.0 percent, compared with an increase of 2.7¬†percent. Services increased 0.9 percent, compared with an increase of 1.5 percent. Real nonresidential fixed investment increased 4.6 percent in the second quarter, in contrast to a¬†decrease of 4.6 percent in the first. Nonresidential structures increased 6.8 percent, in contrast to a¬†decrease of 25.7 percent. Equipment increased 4.1 percent, compared with an increase of 1.6 percent.¬†Intellectual property products increased 3.8 percent, compared with an increase of 3.7 percent. Real¬†residential fixed investment increased 13.4 percent, compared with an increase of 12.5 percent. Real exports of goods and services increased 5.4 percent in the second quarter, in contrast to a¬†decrease of 1.3 percent in the first. Real imports of goods and services increased 9.5 percent, compared¬†with an increase of 0.6 percent. Real federal government consumption expenditures and gross investment decreased 1.5 percent¬†in the second quarter, compared with a decrease of 8.4 percent in the first. National defense decreased¬†0.5 percent, compared with a decrease of 11.2 percent. Nondefense decreased 3.2 percent, compared¬†with a decrease of 3.6 percent. Real state and local government consumption expenditures and gross¬†investment increased 0.3 percent, in contrast to a decrease of 1.3 percent. The change in real private inventories added 0.41 percentage point to the second-quarter change¬†in real GDP after adding 0.93 percentage point to the first-quarter change. Private businesses increased¬†inventories $56.7 billion in the second quarter, following increases of $42.2 billion in the first quarter¬†and $7.3 billion in the fourth. Real final sales of domestic product -- GDP less change in private inventories -- increased 1.3¬†percent in the second quarter, compared with an increase of 0.2 percent in the first. Gross domestic purchases Real gross domestic purchases -- purchases by U.S. residents of goods and services wherever¬†produced -- increased 2.4 percent in the second quarter, compared with an increase of 1.4 percent in the¬†first. Disposition of personal income Current-dollar personal income increased $140.1 billion (4.1 percent) in the second quarter, in¬†contrast to a decrease of $157.1 billion (4.4 percent) in the first. The upturn in personal income¬†primarily reflected sharp upturns in personal dividend income and in wages and salaries and a sharp¬†deceleration in contributions for government social insurance (a subtraction in the calculation of¬†personal income). * Personal dividend income increased in the second quarter, in contrast to a large decrease in the¬†first. The first-quarter decline in dividend income primarily reflected the accelerated and special¬†dividends that were paid by many companies in the fourth quarter of 2012. * Wages and salaries increased in the second quarter, in contrast to a decrease in the first. The¬†first-quarter decline in wages and salaries is based on preliminary quarterly census of¬†employment and wages data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. * The sharp deceleration in contributions for government social insurance primarily reflected the¬†first-quarter expiration of the "payroll tax holiday" that increased the social security contribution¬†rate for employees and self-employed workers by 2.0 percentage points. Personal current taxes increased $36.0 billion in the second quarter, compared with an increase¬†of $74.3 billion in the first. Disposable personal income increased $104.1 billion (3.4 percent) in the second quarter, in¬†contrast to a decrease of $231.5 billion (7.2 percent) in the first.

REUTERS/Carlo AllegriThe ADP jobs report is out, and the numbers are encouraging. U.S. companies added 200,000 jobs in July, which was more than the 180,000 expected by economists. Also, the June payrolls number was revised up to 198,000 from a previous reading of 188,000. "Job growth remains remarkably stable," said Moody's Mark Zandi. "Businesses are adding to payrolls in most industries and across all company sizes. The job market has admirably weathered the fiscal headwinds, tax increases and government spending cuts. This bodes well for the next year when those headwinds are set to fade.‚Äù "The ADP report, which has become more reliable recently, could influence expectations for Friday, although its misses can still be sizable," said High Frequency Economics' Jim O'Sullivan who's looking for 190,000.

This morning the hedge fund manager announced his biggest stake ever ó†9.8% in industrial gas product maker Air Products International,†according to CNBC's Maneet Ahuja. Now shares of the stock are surging in pre-market trading, they're up 4.21% and the stock has surpassed its 52 week high. Check it out in the chart below from†MarketWatch:
Screenshot Of Microsoft's Surface Launch VideoSteve Sinofsky, Microsoft's former Windows chief who was dramatically ousted last November, is banned from joining former rivals including Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google, database giant Oracle, storage company EMC or virtualisation company VMWare before 2014, new documents reveal. Sinofsky is in line for a payoff that will earn him more than $10m (¬£6.6m) according to calculations by the Guardian, covering 418,000 share options that were due to vest through to mid-2016. The agreement also bans him from trying to persuade a list of companies including IBM, Dell, Intel and Nokia from ceasing to be Microsoft customers. Microsoft also revealed that it generated just $853m from sales of its Surface tablet in the year to the end of June, following its ambitious launch last June. That compares against a $900m writedown on unsold Surfaces at the end of the last quarter, and the $1bn of sales and marketing expenses that the company recorded for its fiscal year to the end of June. By contrast, Apple has raked in $24bn from iPad sales in the same period as the Surface has been available. The revenue figure for the Surface suggests that the company sold about 1.7m of the devices between their launch in October and June 2013. That suggests a slow takeoff as the company tries to reorient itself towards becoming a "devices and services" business, as chief executive Steve Ballmer is aiming to do. The restrictions on Sinofsky's future employment are revealed along with Microsoft's official 10-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Sinofsky was ousted apparently following disagreements with Ballmer over the future direction of Windows and the company's focus on software and services. Sinofsky had been seen as an heir apparent to Ballmer's 13-year tenure as chief executive, having previously been a close confidante of Bill Gates ‚Äì and one of the people who warned him in the 1990s about the potential impact of the internet on Microsoft's software-based business. As one of the most senior people to have left Microsoft in the past year, Sinofsky's future had been the source of speculation. The SEC filing shows that he is banned from trying to poach Microsoft staff or persuade customers to go with him. He is also banned from encouraging a list of companies ‚Äì Asus, Acer, Dell, HP, HTC, IBM, Intel, Chinese PC and smartphone maker Lenovo, LG, Nokia, chipmaker Qualcomm, Samsung, Sony and Toshiba ‚Äì from ending their relationship with Microsoft. Since leaving the company officially at the end of December 2012, Sinofsky has been seen in public a number of times, begun teaching classes at Harvard University and has started writing a blog, Learning by Shipping, which offers management observations. The agreement with Microsoft includes a mutual "non-disparagement" clause, meaning that Sinosky ‚Äì a 24-year veteran of Microsoft ‚Äì is unlikely to make any criticism of his former employer's moves. Microsoft's woes with the Surface, which has managed only single-digit shares of the tablet market despite a huge advertising budget, have only added to the problems its Windows division is facing as the PC market slows down. Microsoft says the market generally shrank by 9% year on year as customers shift to tablets and smartphones, and take longer before replacing older PCs.

Richard Sunderland on flickrAs economists, investors and traders prepare for Friday's U.S. jobs report, all eyes today will be on the ADP national employment report. Economists estimate U.S. companies added 180,000 payrolls in July, down from 188,000 in June. "The ADP report, which has become more reliable recently, could influence expectations for Friday, although its misses can still be sizable," said High Frequency Economics' Jim O'Sullivan who's looking for 190,000. But that doesn't mean you should put all of your money on it. "The ADP payroll prediction series is now calculated by Moody‚Äôs Analytics, based on data supplied by ADP, the payrolls services company," expanded UBS's Kevin Cummins. "The report started using a new methodology in October, although its track record is still largely unproven, although the miss in June was quite small (-14k). The absolute value of the miss between the ADP and BLS data has averaged 39,000 since the change in methodology in October. For comparison, from January 2008 through September 2012 the average absolute miss was 81,000." But... "On a month-to-month basis, the ADP data still appear to lack reliability as a predictor when the errors change direction," added Cummins. The report will get released at 8:15 a.m. ET.

Flickr/corrine KlugToday, we get the first official look at Q2 U.S. GDP figures. Market economists predict on average that the U.S. economy grew 1.0% at an annualized pace in the second quarter after posting 1.8% growth in Q1. Personal consumption is expected to have risen 1.6% after a 2.6% advance in Q1. The main culprits for the slowdown in growth: sequestration of the federal budget earlier this year and an attendant knock to consumer spending. "The weakness in the first half of the year owes in part to fiscal tightening which resulted in a sharp drop in government expenditures and likely weighed on consumer and business expenditure," writes the U.S. economics team at BofA Merrill Lynch in a recent report. "Consumers responded with a lag ‚Äî we expect real consumption growth of 1.8% in 2Q compared to the 2.6% gain in 1Q. We also forecast slow growth in capex and a slight contraction in nonresidential structures investment." Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale economists Brian Jones and Aneta Markowska are also on the bearish side of the consensus estimate for Q2 GDP. "We expect the Bureau of Economic Analysis to report that that inflation-adjusted business activity expanded by a paltry 0.4% annualized in Q2, well¬†off the winter quarter‚Äôs less-than-inspiring¬†1.8% pace," say the SocGen economists. "Indeed, a marked slowdown in inflation-adjusted consumer spending from 2.6% to 1.4%, along with sizable drags from slower stock-building and the external sector, points to a sharp slowdown in inflation-adjusted business activity in the spring." However, many are quick to point out that the GDP release is a lagging indicator. "Our economists had long predicted weakness over Q2, and expect data to strengthen this summer," says Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale head of rates and forex strategy Vincent Chaigneau. Perhaps of greater note are the revisions to previous quarters that will accompany the Q2 GDP report. "It would be a big mistake to ignore the comprehensive benchmark revision to GDP on July 31," say BAML economists Michelle Meyer and Alexander Lin. "We think the revisions will be significant, resulting in a higher level of GDP, personal income and the savings rate." Meyer and Lin preview what to look for in the revisions included in tomorrow's report: "This has the potential to alter policymakers‚Äô perceptions of both the depth of the last economic downturn and the speed of the recovery," says Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid. "The last comprehensive benchmark revision occurred in July 2009, just as the economy was emerging from recession. Given that we have seen a steady pattern of upward revisions to nonfarm payrolls, we believe there is a decent probability that real GDP growth will be revised higher over the past couple of years."

REUTERS/Lucas JacksonActivist investor Bill Ackman has made his largest investment ever. According to CNBC's Maneet Ahuja, the activist investor is taking a 9.8% stake in Air Products International (a maker of industrial gas products). That stake is worth $2.2 billion and is reportedly his biggest ever investment. From the report: As for Air Products, "it's a great business that is undervalued," Ackman said Tuesday‚Äîciting a very diverse customer and product base, high barriers to entry, and substantial pricing power. "We have some ideas on how to add value." Some of the diverse businesses of Air Products include supplying industrial gases, performance materials, equipment and technology used in industries from steel production to food processing to electronics. Ackman is known to be on a rough streak, having famously taken a bath on JC Penney, and more recently finding himself on the losing end of a big short of Herbalife. On that last point, Ackman told CNBC that he hasn't covered a single share of Herbalife.
First of all, I think QE did cause some inflation. ¬†Contrary to popular mythology, I don‚Äôt say QE does nothing. ¬†It‚Äôs more that I just think it‚Äôs inadequate. ¬†And when we analyze the current environment and impact of QE we have to consider the counter-factual world without having had any QE. ¬† If the Fed hadn‚Äôt stepped in in 2008 to bolster the banking system we likely would have had a depression in the USA. ¬†The payments system would have seized up for months and maybe even all of 2009 and thousands of businesses would have gone under as bank defaults rippled through the economy. ¬†This would have been hugely deflationary. When the Fed stepped in to make a market in MBS in 2009 they were basically creating capital gains to the tune of billions of dollars for the banking system by announcing that all the GSE assets were worth 100 cents on the dollar. ¬†And this was in addition to their lending facilities and the other bailout programs. ¬†So QE1 had a big impact on the economy in 2009 and 2010. But what about QE2 and the subsequent programs? ¬†Why haven‚Äôt they kept the inflation train going up and up? ¬†Here, I think it‚Äôs incredibly important to separate monetary policy from fiscal policy. ¬†The tendency is for people to look at the Fed‚Äôs purchases of bonds as financing the deficit. ¬†I think that skews the reality and implies that the Fed is needed to buy the bonds (as if there would be no other buyers without QE). ¬†We know this is right because QE2 already proved it in real-time when big bond investors like Bill Gross said ‚Äúwho will buy the bonds‚Äù when QE2 ended and people like me said ‚Äúyou will buy them!‚Äù ¬†The ‚Äúmonetization‚Äù crowd was wrong as yields tanked after QE2. ¬†There was no shortage of buyers for Treasury bonds at all. ¬†So let‚Äôs just look at QE for what it is ‚Äì open market operations and not necessarily a part of fiscal policy. Now, I don‚Äôt think it should be controversial to say that spending is a function of income relative to desired saving. ¬†Inflation is an extension of spending. ¬†And if producers have pricing power due to high aggregate demand or aggregate supply shortages then prices will generally rise (I‚Äôm oversimplifying, but for the purposes of this discussion that‚Äôs sufficient). ¬†So you generally need the spending if you‚Äôre ever going to have the inflation. ¬†It‚Äôs that old demand thing. ¬†If you‚Äôve ever run a business you know that revenues and pricing power don‚Äôt exist without customers walking in the door. The problem with QE is that it doesn‚Äôt have a transmission mechanism to substantially increase aggregate demand. ¬†When the Fed buys bonds from a bank they simply swap reserves for t-bonds. ¬†The bank has the same net worth (roughly, depending on any capital gains and as mentioned previously QE1, 2 and 3 have had diminishing returns here) and the reserves sit in the interbank market (and no, they don‚Äôt get ‚Äúlent out‚Äù, that‚Äôs not how banking works). ¬†The bank might feel inclined to shift its portfolio holdings and replace lost T-bond income so it might go buy stocks or bonds of other types, but this doesn‚Äôt guarantee sustainable capital gains because there has been nothing directly attached to this balance sheet change that necessarily justifies an increase in share prices. When QE is done via a non-bank the non-bank gets deposits, sells the t-bond to the bank and the bank does their reserve for t-bond swap with the Fed. ¬†Again, there‚Äôs no change in private sector net worth and no change in incomes. ¬†So, if we go back to our original understanding of inflation (that spending and ultimately inflation, is a function of incomes relative to desired saving) then it becomes rather obvious why QE hasn‚Äôt caused high inflation. ¬†It hasn‚Äôt increased incomes. ¬†And it hasn‚Äôt increased savings (except mainly for wealthy Americans who own stocks and bonds). So, what it all really comes down to is this: 1) ¬†How much does QE impact rates which can influence lending and investment? ¬† I‚Äôd argue not that given that QE should have bolstered inflation, but it has actually fallen which has resulted in bond markets bidding prices higher (and yields lower). ¬† 2) ¬†How impactful is the ‚Äúwealth effect‚Äù and portfolio rebalancing effect? ¬† This is the meat of QE. ¬†It has powerful psychological effects, but I think the evidence of sustainable capital gains from QE is weak. ¬†For instance, why hasn‚Äôt QE in Europe supported the peripheral stock markets? 3) ¬†How much does QE help shore up bank balance sheets? ¬† QE1 probably helped a lot. ¬†The subsequent programs probably haven‚Äôt helped nearly as much. ¬† 4) ¬†How much more does the private sector spend when they swap t-bonds for cash? ¬† If the wealth effect is substantial then those in the upper class probably spend a good deal more as the value of their cash and bonds increase. ¬†Whether this can be sustained or helps the broad economy is up for debate still. ¬† 5) ¬†Does QE drive down the dollar relative to other currencies leading to more competitive trade? ¬†The USD basket is essentially flat since QE started in 2008 so the answer is definitely no. ¬† That‚Äôs all a bit oversimplified and it‚Äôs not my intention to try to prove that QE does nothing, but if you understood all of this 5 years ago you steered well clear of any hyperinflation or even high inflation predictions. ¬†In other words, it looks like QE isn‚Äôt everything it‚Äôs trumped up to be‚Ä¶.
Yesterday, President Obama talked up corporate tax reform, and one issue that The White House, as well as large corporations, would like to see addressed is cash held overseas. Large US multinationals have tons of cash parked overseas because to repatriate it would involve a big tax hit on that cash, so they leave it out there, hoping, perhaps that the law will change, or that there will be a one-day repatriation holiday. The White House didn't endorse a repatriation holiday, but instead put forth the idea of a one-time levy on foreign-held cash, after which companies could do what they please with that money. Ezra Klein has a good explainer here. There's pretty low odds of this stuff going anywhere, but just talking about foreign cash gets investors interested in who has the cash overseas that could potentially be liberated in a deal. Goldman Sachs put out a report on the matter, saying: President Obama proposed a series of economic measures today including changes to corporate taxation. Repatriation was not specifically mentioned, but market participants interpreted the ‚Äúonetime revenues‚Äù associated with the transition to a new business tax system as a sign of possible support for low-tax repatriation of foreign profits. Via that report, here are the top 10 companies with boatloads of cash parked abroad. Click the image to enlarge Goldman Sachs According to Goldman, the top 50 companies have a total of $1.3 trillion overseas.
Unemployment in Europe is still in nosebleed territories, but for the first time in ages it didn't get worse in the month of June. In the Eurozone, unemployment was stable at 12.1% (slightly beating expectations) and for the EU there was actually a dip to 10.9% from 11.0%. While not all datapoints are showing improvement, this latest report helps corroborate the notion that the European economy bottomed some time in Q2, and is now rebounding. It's not amazing by any standards, but enough numbers are showing this so as to indicate that the recession has probably ended, which is something we argued last week after some manufacturing numbers. Here's chart showing improvement on the EU line for the first time in years. Eurostat
YouTubeThe big event this week is Friday's Non-Farm Payrolls report. People are expected a number a bit south of 200K, but it's possible we could see something much stronger. And the implications are significant, since this is one of the last jobs reports before the September FOMC meeting, when the Fed is likely to start slowing the pace of bond purchases (the taper). Anyway, here's one interesting nugget that suggests that we're likely to see a strong number. Following yesterday's consumer confidence report, Morgan Stanley observes The current conditions index jumped 5 points to 73.6, high since May 2008. The percentage of respondents saying jobs are currently "plentiful" rose to 12.2% from 11.3%, and the percentage saying jobs are "hard to get" fell to 35.5% from 37.1%. That left the net result on this question 2.5pp higher at -23.3%, high since September 2008. This question matches up well with trends in actual labor market conditions over time, so these results were a positive indication for the July employment report. Our initial forecast (which we'll take a look at after the ADP report) was for a marginally slower 185,000 gain in nonfarm payrolls in July and downtick in the unemployment rate to 7.5%. Improved confidence in prospects for finding a job is probably going to continue to bring back more discouraged workers back into the labor force, slowing the decline in the unemployment rate relative to an improved pace of job growth. Remember, consumer confidence was a slight miss, although probably not anything to get excited about either way.
flickr / Pernilla RydmarkIt's a big day for the economy, as we have lots of fresh data out, and an FOMC meeting. Via Calculated Risk, here are the expectations: ï At 8:15 AM, the ADP Employment Report for July. This report is for private payrolls only (no government). The consensus is for 179,000 payroll jobs added in July, down from 188,000 in June. ï At 8:30 AM, the BEA will release the advance estimate of Q2 GDP. The consensus is that real GDP increased 1.1% annualized in Q2. This report will includes a Comprehensive Revision from 1929 through 1st quarter 2013. ï At 9:45 AM, the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for July. The consensus is for an increase to 54.0, up from 51.6 in June. ï Ar 2:00 PM, the FOMC Meeting Announcementwill be released. No change to interest rates or QE purchases is expected at this meeting. GDP will probably get all the headlines, but an argument could be made that ADP will be the most important, as it's a preview of Friday's jobs report, and Friday's jobs report has significant implications for the Fed, and what it's going to do at its September meeting.
Joe WeisenthalHow are we looking today on our call that the European recession is coming to an end? It's a split so far. First, there's one bad datapoint out of Germany. Retail sales unexpectedly slumped 1.5%, which is the worst month since December 2012. Meanwhile, Italian unemployment unexpected dropped to 12.1% from 12.2%. It had been expected to rise to 12.3%. Coupled with the recent drop in Spain's unemployment rate, there is evidence of a turn in the peripheral labor market.
dbking, FlickrMarkets are generally lower. Starting off with Asia, Japan fell 1.45% last night. The Nikkei has been wobbly lately, and Japan is riding a string of weak economic data. Europe is generally lower. Italy is down 0.6% (despite a better than expected unemployment report) and Germany is off 0.37% despite a weak retail sales number. France is off by about the same amount. US futures are just down a hair. There are four big events in the US today. They are: The ADP Jobs report (which is a preview for Friday's official jobs report), the GDP report, Chicago PMI (a regional manufacturing index) and a Fed decision this afternoon.
