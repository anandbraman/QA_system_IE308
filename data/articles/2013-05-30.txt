Â  American households have regained less than half of the wealth lost during the Great Recession (2007 to 2009), according to a new analysis from the St. Louis Federal Reserve. That's a far cry from a separate report by the New York Federal Reserve in March, which declared families had regained a whopping 91% of their losses.Â  Why the big discrepency?Â  Turns out the New York Fed hadn't accounted for two major factors: population growth (U.S. households have grown by nearly 4 million since the recession) and inflation.Â  When St. Louis Fed researchers took another look, they foundÂ U.S. households accumulated net worth totaling $66 trillion at the end of last year, down 55 percent from the peak in 2007 when adjusted for inflation and population growth. The report found that "younger, less-educated and African-American and Hispanic families lost the most." These demographics suffered for various reasons, including high levels of debt, exposure to hard-hit occupations like construction, high concentrations of wealth in housing â€” which got destroyed in the crash. Although household have beenÂ rebuilding their savings and paying down their debts in recent years,Â the recovery has been far from evenly distributed since it was largely tied to stocks. From the report: Of the total recovery of $14.7 trillion between the first quarter of 2009 and the fourth quarter of 2012, $9.1 trillion, or 62 percent, of the gain was due to higher stock-market wealth. Stock wealth is unevenly held, with the vast majority of stocks owned by a relatively small number of wealthy families. Thus, most families have recovered much less than the average amount. Therefore, the report states, any conclusion that "the financial damage of the crisis and recession largely has been repaired is not justified.â€ REUTERS/Eric ThayerA home that was damaged by Hurricane Sandy, is seen in Union Beach, New Jersey November 12, 2012.

Tumbler founder David Karp just opened up about why he sold his company to Yahoo for $1.1 billion earlier this month.   "I was not expecting to sell the company this year," 26-year-old Karp told Charlie Rose on an interview that aired Thursday. He had been working with Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer on a partnership deal for months, since November, he said. So Mayer had to sell him on the idea that Yahoo should, instead, buy Tumblr. "We knew we would working together," he said, but "when Marissa showed up in New York, she walked me down a story of how we can do even more together." Mayer wanted Tumblr because she was "looking for a future for Yahoo, a path forward and growth." She convinced Karp that an acquisition would save Karp from a painful learning curve. "This was an unbelievable opportunity to shortcut all the very hard things that we are about to be going through," he said. That's because Tumblr's business "hinges on" creative brand advertising, he told Rose. Yet, as we previously reported, some research showed that Tumblr was a ghost town for brands. Of more than 10,000 brands tracked by social media marketing company Optimal, less than a quarter had a presence on Tumblr. Those that did hardly used their Tumblr accounts. But Yahoo has "a legacy, and a huge amount of resources, around all the business stuff that Tumblr was about to go through" and "a big honkin' salesforce," Karp said. Mayer tossed in more than a billion in cash and the deal was done. Watch:
REUTERS/Shannon StapletonForeclosure and bank owned sales fell 18% in the first quarter to 190,121, according to RealtyTrac's latest report.Â  This is down 22% from Q1 2012. Foreclosure and short sales accounted for 21% of all residential sales in Q1, down form 25% in Q1 2012, and a peak of 45% in Q1 2009.Â  Meanwhile, non-foreclosure short sales were down 10% from Q4 2012, and down 35% from Q1 2012.Â  Including non-foreclosure short sales, the share of distressed sales came to 36%. The decline in foreclosure related sales is in large part because ofÂ  a decline in foreclosure activity. But the decline in non-foreclosure short sales was "surprising" according to RaltyTrac vice president Daren Blomquist, given that 11 million homeowners are in negative equity.Â  "Rising home prices in many markets are stunting the continued growth of short sales by reducing incentive for both underwater homeowners and lenders. "Underwater homeowners may be willing to stick it out a few more months or even years in the hope that they will be able to walk away with money at the closing table and without a hit to their credit rating, and for lenders a failed short sale may no longer translate into bigger losses down the road given that average prices of bank-owned homes are rising â€” at a faster pace than non-distressed home prices in many markets." Here are some details from the report: Here's a look at foreclosure sales against average foreclosure sale price: RealtyTrac
I started writing my first book, Active Value Investing: Making Money in Range-Bound Markets, in 2005; finished it in 2007; and published the second, an abridged version of the first (The Little Book of Sideways Markets), in 2010. In both books I made the case that there is a very high probability that we are in the midst of a secular sideways market â€“ a market that goes up and down, with a lot of cyclical volatility, but ends up going nowhere for a long time. Sideways markets happen not because stock market gods play an unkind joke on gullible humans but because of human emotions. Historically, sideways markets have always followed secular bull markets. At the end of secular bull markets stocks become very expensive â€“ their valuations (P/Es) get very high. Sideways markets are just a payback for all the fun and returns stock investors received during secular bull markets. In 1999, after 17 years of incredible returns, the mother of all secular bull markets ended at valuations we'd never seen before. For this reason, in my first book I argued that the present sideways market, which started then, might last longer than past ones. In the Little Book I want a step farther with the benefit of hindsight â€“ it was written post-Great Recession. I argued that the economic growth rate going forward will be lower than it was in the past, and thus this sideways market may even last longer than I originally suspected.Every so often I get an email from a reader with the question, â€œAre we there yet?â€ Are we still in the grip of a treacherous sideways market, or we are now entering into a secular bull market? I will try to answer that question as best I can in this writeup. The Sideways View of The World In early May I had the pleasure of attending and speaking at the Value Investing Congress in Las Vegas. The last time I spoke there it was May 2008 and the market was just coming off its top. (Here is a PDF of the '08 presentation, and the new presentation is here.) The S&amp;P was at 18x trailing earnings. Profit margins were at a modern-day high. They subsequently collapsed but came back to set an even higher high. The market was not cheap in 2008. It is not cheap now, either. Before I dive into my argument I need to introduce you to a very simple calculation that is at the core of my sideways argument: E + Change in P/E + Dividends = Total Return Stock price movements are driven by two variables: earnings growth and changes in the price-to-earnings ratio. Add dividends, and you have total stock returns. The dividend yield of an average stock today is 2% â€“ it is all yours to keep, so my discussion here will focus on the direction of â€œEâ€ and â€œP/E.â€ If you were to normalize profits for high margins and look at 10-year trailing earnings, in 2008 stocks were trading 66% above their historical average. They were at 30 times 10-year trailing earnings (see next chart). Vitaliy Katsenelson In all honesty, I could make the same presentation today as I did five years ago (in fact I borrowed and updated a few slides from that presentation â€“ see next chart). Market valuation is not dramatically different now from what it was then. A cyclical bear and a cyclical bull market later, the S&amp;P 500 is still at the same 18 times trailing earnings and 26 times 10-year trailing P/E, or 41% above average. (It was 60% above average in 2008.) Vitaliy Katsenelson Â (See footnote at end for a detailed explanation of the above chart.) Investors who were on the sidelines over the last few years and who are now pouring money into stocks, expecting that we are in the midst of a secular bull market, will likely be disappointed The previous sideways market of 1966-1982 had four cyclical bull markets and five cyclical bear markets packed inside it. From 1970 to 1973 the Dow went from 700 to 1,000, just to drop again, this time to 600. Four times, investors thought that a cyclical bull market had turned into a secular (long-term, 1982-1999 type of ) bull market, but their hopes were dashed as they discovered that these were just head fakes toward the next cyclical bear market (see next chart). Vitaliy Katsenelson It is when nobody wants to own stocks ever again, when valuations are below their historical average, that a secular sideways market finally dies (actually more like goes into hibernation) and the next secular bull market is born.
Below is a pretty simple chart from Morgan Stanley that illustrates a pretty important concept. Historically, when 10-year bond yields fall below 3% for an extended period of time, stocks and bond yields tend to go in opposite directions (meaning stocks and bonds rise in tandem). That's more or less been the status quo during the past few years of sub-3% 10-year yields. The last time bond yields rose above 3% â€“ all the way back in the 1950s, as the chart shows â€“ the correlation went positive. Stocks were rising while bonds were selling off, sending yields higher (think "Great Rotation"). The problem is that these transitions from one market phase to the next "can be very confusing," as Morgan Stanley puts it â€“ after all, when correlations flip from negative to positive, they inevitably pass through a range characterized by little or no correlation. Given the recent surge in stocks and some of the flirtation with rising bond yields we have seen so far in 2013, the correlation chart is worth keeping in mind.

APThe White House thinks it is unnecessary to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the IRS' inappropriate scrutiny of conservative groups, risking potential backlash from an American public that overwhelmingly supports such a measure across party lines.Â  Deputy Press Secretary Josh Earnest said on Thursday that the White House is not looking into appointing a special prosecutor, something 76 percent of Americans said they supported in a Quinnipiac poll. "And the reason for that simply is that there is a new IRS commissioner in place, Danny Werfel, who is a career civil servant, who represented â€” who served in administrations led by Republican Presidents and Democratic Presidents," Earnest told reporters aboard Air Force One. "Heâ€™s conducting a 30-day review â€” that was a review that was ordered by the Secretary of the Treasury at the direction of the President. That is an ongoing review that is taking place." "There are a lot of people looking at this from a lot of different perspectives," he added. "And weâ€™re confident that those who need to be held accountable for the wrongdoing that occurred there will be held accountable. And the President is committed to making sure that those steps are taken to make sure this doesn't happen again." As Earnest said, Congress is already investigating the matter. And Attorney General Eric Holder said the Department of Justice has opened a criminal probe. Still, numerous Republicans have called for an independent investigator to conduct a review. And the Quinnipiac poll shows that the public overwhelmingly supports that step. According to the poll, 76 percent of Americans would support such a step. That includes 63 percent of Democrats, 78 percent of Independents, and 88 percent of Republicans.Â  The poll also found that a majority of Americans (53 percent) view the IRS' targeting of conservative groups as a "scandal," while 44 percent said that members of Congress have "legitimate concerns" in their investigation of the matter.

There Are Very Few Reliable Predictors Of Stock Market Returns (Vanguard) Expected returns are an important part of asset allocation. Vanguard's chief economist Joe Davis said that in the short term, especially in the next year, there are very few reliable predictors of stock market returns. In the longer term there is somewhat more of an association.Â  "Yet we also have to acknowledge that the correlation or the association, the ability of valuations to relate with future returns, even in a ten-year horizon, is somewhat less than 50%, so 40%. So again, it can help inform and help guide what a reasonable essential tendency of returns are, but it certainly is not so definitive that it would give you one number." Vanguard Market Vane Bullish Sentiment Is At 70% And That Last Time It Was Here Was In 2007 (Gluskin Sheff) David Rosenberg says there may be "too much good (or stimulative) news priced into the stock market. Investors Intelligence shows 52.1% bulls and 19.8% bears. "That 32.3 percentage point gap can indeed be considered an extreme, and it turned out to be a bit of a yellow flag heading into last year's soggy summer." Moreover, Market Vane bullish sentiment at around 70% is right where it was in the summer of 2007â€¦ just as a reminder." Gluskin Sheff Morgan Stanley Case Against Brokers That Left For Stifel (Reuters) Three brokers that managed $229 million in client assets at Morgan Stanley's Coeur dâ€™Alene office in Idaho, quit to set up a Stifel Nicolaus office. Now, Morgan Stanley is asking as Idaho court to prevent the three brokers from recruiting other advisors from its Coeur d'Alene office. Reuters quoted a court filing from Morgan Stanley that stated that this caused ""upset, anxiety, insecurity, uneasiness and concern" at "a relatively small office." Lawyers also told Reuters that this could help separate "raiding" from routine recruitment.  The Real Damage That ETF's Have Inflicted In Investment Performance (El Cap) In recent years individuals and institutions have put $1.5 trillion into ETFs. Andrew Haigney of El CAP writes that ETFs have hurt investment performance.Â  "The real damage ETFs have inflicted on investors lies in investment performance. By embracing ETFs, active managers have wholeheartedly embraced indexing.Â  We donâ€™t have anything against indexing, in fact in most cases itâ€™s the right way to go.Â  But remember that the only reason an investor pays an active manager is to get investment returns above and beyond the index.Â  When active management strategies heavily rely on the use of ETFs, investors get stuck with indexed returns, with very little chance for relative out performance." Here's What 515 Interest Rate Cuts And $12 Trillion Will Do To The Global Credit Markets (Bank of America) "In the past 6 years, central banks around the world have cut interest rates 515 times, increased global liquidity by $12 trillion and crushed bond yields to the point that almost 50% of all global government bond market cap currently trades below 1%," writes Michael Hartnett at Bank of America.

For decades, women have worked to close the gender gap. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that currently women earn around 81 cents to the dollar.Â  But the BLS data isn't the most accurate metric to compare wages, according to new data from Payscale, released today. There's hardly a gender gap at all, actually; it's just that women choose jobs that pay less. The BLS looks more broadly at the wage data, and since men still dominate higher-paying jobs, that accounts for the discrepancy. On the other hand, Payscale looked at 40 million career profiles and controlled the wage data for education, type of work, and more â€” and found a much smaller gap. According to the report: At the individual contributor level, the controlled gender wage gap is only 2% (i.e., women earn 98% of men holding the same position), but at the executive level, the controlled gender wage gap is nearly 9%. PayScale chief economist Katie Bardaro told the Atlantic's Derek Thompson that the government "compares all weekly earnings, even though women and men do different things. We're trying to compare men and women with the same education, same management responsibilities, similar employers, in companies with a similar number of employees, [in which case] the gender wage gap disappears for most positions." The biggest discrepancy is at the top, among executives: Payscale  It's great news that the wage gap may not be quite as large as we think. But the big discrepancy at the top is still a problem, and something people like Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg is working to fix. We're headed in the right direction, but achieving equal pay at the top may just be a matter of how quickly women fill up executive offices.

Former Microsoft Windows boss Steven Sinofsky says he's good with the way things are going so far for Microsoft's Windows 8. "It’s hard for me to look at selling 100 million of something and not be happy," Sinofsky told AllThingsD Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher on stage at the D11 Conference on Thursday. Windows 8 was his baby. But no longer. He left Microsoft a month after Windows 8 shipped. The 100 million number he refers to is how many Windows licenses Microsoft says it has sold.  However, that number is probably generous, as it includes Windows 8 machines that are sitting on retail shelves and warehouses waiting to be bought. By some calculations, Microsoft has really actually sold 60 million Windows 8 licenses. Plus, Microsoft's new operating system has been widely panned for being difficult to use and has shouldered much of the blame for a struggling PC industry. Market research firm IDC reported that PC shipments fell 14% from the year-earlier quarter and called Windows 8 out for blame. IDC also says it expects Windows 8 sales to improve over time. Sinofsky thinks it will actually take years before anyone will know if Microsoft really has a dog on its hands. "You have resist the urge to pick winners and losers and who's on top because it will play out for many years," he said.

During an announcement that Tesla Motors will immediately and dramatically increase its network of Supercharger stations around the country, CEO Elon Musk said that he plans to take a road trip across the country in a Model S, recharging along the way. Because the Model S seats seven, he is taking his five young sons with him. The family will start in Los Angeles and arrive in New York, with stops in Las Vegas, the Grand Canyon, Colorado's Wolf Creek Pass, the Four Corners, Wyoming, Mount Rushmore, Chicago, and Philadelphia. "It might end up being like some Chevy Chase movie," Musk joked. Musk says the itinerary will recreate a road trip he took in college, but it also follows the corridor of Superchargers very closely: At every point he named, a station will be within range. Here's the state of the Supercharger network Tesla says will be in place by the end of 2013, with Musk's proposed route superimposed on it: Tesla Motors / Business Insider
Emerging market equities, as an asset class, is turning in the worst monthly performance since last May, losing about 2.4%, so far. The MSCI Emerging Market (free float) Index is off 5% from the high recorded on May 9 and is about 6.5% below the year's peak reached in early January. On top of the low measured inflation in the US, despite QE, the sell-off in gold, despite the claims that paper money has been debased, the weakness of emerging market equities is a shock to many investors and observers. Â  Three forces have weighed on emerging market equities most recently: Â the slowing of China, weaker commodity prices and the backing up of US yields (~60 bp in the 10-year note) weighed sentiment. Â The important point here is that external variables more than domestic reforms seems to be the main driver of flows. Â More generally, foreign equity buyers have seemed more attracted to the US and Japanese shares than emerging markets. The Financial Times reports today that "Southeast Asian equity markets are on tear. Â Ripped on the US Federal Reserve's easy money, the markets keep rising and the cash keeps coming in." Â  This is misleading and it seems to recognize the hyperbole. Â Citing data from EPFR, it notes that 3/4 of the money (~$20 bln) that has gone into non-Japanese Asian equity funds since the Fed began QE3, occurred in December 2012 and January 2013. Â  The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index excluding Japan is off 5.85% from the month's high and closed today at its lowest level since mid-April. Â  The two bourses that the FT highlights are Thailand and the Philippines. Â Yet Â foreigners have been net sellers of Thai shares this year, divesting themselves of about $735 mln worth. Â More than half of these sales took place in thus far this week (~$488 ln). Â Thailand's stock market is off about 1% this month, after losing about 3% over the past five sessions. Â  Â Â  Foreign demand for Philippine shares has held in better. Â Non-residents have purchased about $1.46 bln worth of Philippine equities this year, even though they sold about $111 mln so far this week. Â The Philippines Stock Exchange is up almost 20% year-to-date, making it the second best performer in the region behind Tokyo (despite the foreign selling Thailand's market is up 13.6% year-to-date). Outside of Japan and India, Taiwan has seen the largest foreign capital inflows into its equity market this year. Â More than half of the $4.4 bln that foreign investors have plucked down on Taiwan shares this year has come in here in May (~$2.4 bln). Â Yet Taiwan's Taiex is up 7% year-to-date and a meager 1.8% over he past month. Â  Latam American bourses have fared worse. Â ILF, the ETF which tracks the S&amp;P Latam 40 Index, has fallen 11% this year and is off 3.2% since the early May peak. Â Mexico's Bolsa is off 3.8% this month, going into today's session, which is tantamount to half the year's decline. Â The weakening economic data apparently trumps the surprise 50 bp rate cut earlier this year (and anticipation of additional rate cuts).Â Â  Brazil's Bovespa Â was essentially flat going into yesterday's session when it lost about 2.5% ahead of the anticipated rate hike by the central bank after the markets closed (a 50 bp hike was delivered, while many expected only a 25 bp hike). Â That monetary policy is going in the opposite direction of most other countries has not been lost on investors and the 10% decline in the Bovespa this year makes it among the worst performing markets (though Peru's equity market is off 22% this year).

Two days ago there was some strange trading activity before the May Consumer Confidence number came out. There was an explosion in SPY (the SPDR Sector S&amp;P ETF), the eMini (electronically traded futures) and hundreds of other stocks 1/4 second before the number came out. In trading time, that's forever. Eric Hunsader the CEO of market research firm Nanex, told Business Insider that the strange activity was most likely a case of 'banging the beehive.' That's the phrase traders use to describe what happens when a high frequency trader sends out a barrage of orders before right before a key event (like a report), impacting price and forcing everyone in the market to move their positions. It's wild stuff, and seeing it in action is even wilder. Today, Nanex posted a video of trading in the SPY ahead of the Consumer Confidence number. You can check it out below. It shows a half second before the 10:00 am announcement, slowed down for 5:39. You'll note activity explodes at 9:59:59.755. Also, just FYI, the little colorful bars are exchanges. 
REUTERS/Robert GalbraithThe U.S. housing recovery reached "two significant milestones," according to Capital Economics' Ed Stansfield. First, both CoreLogic and Case Shiller showed a double digit increase in home prices in March. Second, the number of homes listed for sale climbed to 6.3 million in April. "If we exclude November 2009, when homebuyer tax credits were distorting the market, the 6m mark was last breached back in 2007," writes Stansfield. The reason the 6.3 million figure is significant is because it compares with annualized home sales of 5.4 million. What this basically means is that in the near-term, sheer momentum will help boost home prices.Â  But prices should moderate this year because supply exceeds sales. This latter point cools concerns about a new housing bubble: "To put that into context, if the current listings/sales differential was to be sustained, end-month inventory levels would return to their long-run average level of just under 2.6m homes in the first quarter of next year. That would mean that the monthsâ€™ of unsold homes measure, a useful indicator of the short-term supply and demand balance, and thus price pressures, would rise from 4.9 to 5.7. In turn, that implies that the pace of house price gains would ease notably over the remainder of this year, dampening fears that the US housing market is again entering bubble territory." Here's a longer term look at housing supply and demand. Capital Economics

Google MapsThe co-op at 953 Fifth Avenue that belonged to Robert McKeon, the founder and chairman of private equity firm Veritas Capital who killed himself last year, has hit the market for $11.5 million, StreetEasy shows. Jed Garfield and Matthew Pravda of Leslie J. Garfield &amp; Co. have the listing for the four-bedroom, 3.5-bathroom renovated duplex. McKeon’s death at 58 made headlines when it was ruled a suicide. He died of asphyxia in September 2012 at his home in Darien, Conn., press reports show. He purchased the co-op in November 2006 for $7.3 million, according to city property records. The brief listing said the apartment includes working fireplaces and offers “both views and sophistication.” McKeon’s family recently unloaded his Hamptons estate to fellow financial mogul Steven Cohen, the founder of hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors. Cohen — who is currently listing his home at One Beacon Court for $115 million — paid $60 million for the spread on Further Lane in East Hamptons, as previously reported. McKeon’s three-acre Connecticut estate is reportedly worth $5 million, and includes five bedrooms and six bathrooms. The late financier owned another home in ski town Telluride, Colo., the Daily Mail reported. A native of the Bronx, McKeon founded Veritas in 1992. He was previously chairman and a founding partner at investment bank Wasserstein Perella &amp; Co. Garfield and Pravda did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
After completely exing out their fixed income group, UBS finally has some good news for bankers. According to Bloomberg, those who survived the culling at Switzerland's biggest bank will get a raise. Wall Street is still downsizing from the financial crisis â€” trying to pay for lawsuits, figure out which businesses to boost amid new regulation etc., so news like this is a big deal for bankers everywhere. It's possibly an even bigger deal at UBS, where the end of its fixed income business meant 10,000 lost jobs. From Bloomberg: UBS is informing staff of the move this week, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the plan hasnâ€™t been made public. The average raise for employees in its advisory and trading businesses will be about 9 percent, one of the people said. Some employees may get as much as 25 percent, two of the people said. UBS expects to keep total compensation, including bonuses, unchanged if business conditions remain the same, one of the people said. Enjoy that, people. For the full story, head to Bloomberg&gt;
Tesla Motors will immediately and dramatically increase its network of Supercharger stations around the country, the electric car company announced this afternoon. The number of stations will triple by the end of June, and by the end of 2013, Tesla owners will be able to drive from Los Angeles to New York using the stations. Tesla also plans to add ports at many stations (so more cars can charge at the same time). The maximum charge rate at the stations will go up by a third, so batteries can be charged to two-thirds capacity in 20 minutes, instead of halfway in 30 minutes. Here's the network as it stands now. Red dots indicate installed stations, gray dots are stations in progress: Tesla Motors Here's what it will be by the end of June: Tesla Motors In six months: Tesla Motors  By the end of 2013: Tesla Motors Two years out: Tesla Motors And here's an animated look at just how dramatic that increase will look:  Here's the full release: TESLA DRAMATICALLY EXPANDS SUPERCHARGER NETWORK, Delivering CONVENIENT, free LONG DISTANCE DRIVING THROUGHOUT U.s. and Canada   Thursday, mAY 30, 2013 – Tesla Motors (NASDAQ: TSLA) today announced significant expansion of the Tesla Supercharger network. Supercharging enables Tesla Model S drivers to travel long distances, for free, indefinitely. The expansion of the network builds upon the success of the Tesla Supercharger network that covers California and Nevada on the west coast and the Washington, DC to Boston region on the east coast. The Tesla Supercharger network has enabled an estimated 1 million miles of driving since going live in October 2012. Superchargers are designed for city to city travel, enabling Model S electric vehicle drivers to travel for about three hours, take a 20 to 30 minute break to grab lunch or a soda or coffee, and get back on the road charged up. For free. With the accelerated rollout of the Tesla Supercharger network, Model S drivers can expect: ·         Triple the number of Tesla Supercharger stations by the end of next month, including additional stations in California, coverage of the northwest region from Vancouver to Seattle to Portland, Austin to Dallas in Texas, Illinois and Colorado. There will also be four additional eastern seaboard stations, expanding the density of the network to provide for more convenient stopping points. ·         Within six months the Tesla Supercharger network will connect most of the major metro areas in the US and Canada, including expansion into Arizona, additional stations in Texas, Florida, and the Midwest, stations connecting Ottawa to Montreal, and across North and South Carolina into Georgia. It will also be possible to travel diagonally across the country from Los Angeles to New York using only the Tesla Supercharger network. ·         A year from now, the Tesla Supercharger network will stretch across the continent, covering almost the entire population of the US and Canada. The expansion of the network will mean that Model S drivers can take the ultimate road trip -- whether that’s LA to New York, Vancouver to San Diego, or Montreal to Miami – without spending a cent on fuel. In addition to the expansion of the Tesla Supercharger network itself, Tesla is improving the technology behind the Tesla Supercharger to dramatically decrease the amount of time it takes to charge Model S, cutting charging time in half relative to early trials of the system.  The new technology, which is in beta test mode now and will be fully rolled out to customers this summer, will allow Model S to be charged at 120 kW, replenishing three hours of driving in just over 20 minutes. ABOUT TESLA Tesla Motors’ (NASDAQ: TSLA) goal is to accelerate the world’s transition to electric mobility with a full range of increasingly affordable electric cars.

AP Photo/Denis FarrellHedge funds are known for being high powered, high performing financial firms that employ the smartest people and command the top of top dollar for their services. So it's important to keep up with what they're doing. This morning, two snippets of information about hedge funds caught our eye. If you think about them at all, you should know these facts about their performance and who's behind it. 1. 61% of all the money in hedge funds is managed by the 100 largest hedge funds, according to research firm Prequin. So if you're tracking them you're really tracking the industry. 2. Hedge fund performance has been abysmal since the financial crisis. This year they're up an average of 5% compared to the S&amp;P's 15% gain. Investors have kept putting their money in funds, though. That is, until now, according to Bloomberg: Hedge Fund Research said in April that funds saw inflows in 14 of the last 15 quarters (PDF)â€”but now there is evidence that substandard returns may finally be having an effect. According to eVestment, the $2.69 trillion industry has seen net inflows of just $5.8 billion through the first four months of the year, which it calls the slowest rate of growth to start a year on record. (The firmâ€™s database goes back to the third quarter of 2003.) The figure is also the second-worst total on record, after the start of 2009, when investors pulled out $260 billion. Just consider that a quick public service announcement.

Business Insider/Matthew Boesler, data from BloombergThe South African rand (ZAR) has had a rough go of it lately. The currency has fallen from levels around 9.00 against the U.S. dollar just three weeks ago to levels around 10.00 today. "The key negative risk from headlines out of the mining sector wage negotiations is playing out in a text book fashion – alongside plummeting gold prices and rising rates – creating a perfect storm for ZAR," write Bank of America Merrill Lynch currency strategists. The ongoing unrest in South Africa's mining sector – which relies heavily on exports of gold and other metals – is dragging down the country's economy, as worse-than-expected first quarter GDP growth figures revealed earlier this week. Today, South African President Jacob Zuma held what Jon Herskovitz, the Reuters correspondent on the ground in Pretoria, described as a "hastily convened" press conference in order to play down concerns about how wage negotiations with miners are progressing there. Zuma's presser definitely did not work – the rand is down a massive 3.3% against the U.S. dollar today alone. The weak GDP release, coupled with the latest drama in the mining sector, has sent the rand into freefall this week, but the underlying economic fundamentals have been missing from the story for a while. "Countries like Hungary, Poland, Mexico, Malaysia – you always have some positives for real money investors to base their judgment on, that basically help them to withstand volatility," says Bartosz Pawlowski, Head of CEEMEA Strategy at BNP Paribas. "In South Africa there are very few positives in terms of fundamentals, so the only reason to be buying rand at this level at the moment is the fact that it has sold off so much, which may or may not be a great reason, but it's just the level – there's nothing beneath that." Bad fundamentals. Bad headline risk. And to top it off, global financial markets have all been subjected to an earth-shaking sell-off in the U.S. Treasury market, the largest and most liquid bond market in the world. The rand is no exception. Treasury yields and the U.S. dollar have been rising ever since fears that the Federal Reserve would begin to taper back its monetary stimulus sooner than was previously thought seeped into the marketplace. The rand is a "high-beta" currency, which means its own moves against the dollar tend to be more pronounced than those in other currencies. One big reason why the rand behaves like that, says Pawlowski, is that it's much easier to "bully" the rand than other emerging market currencies. The South African Reserve Bank is in a tough spot. It doesn't have a lot of currency reserves, so they don't have the same liberty to engage in currency interventions to defend the rand's value as some other central banks – Turkey, Brazil, and Russia, for example – currently enjoy. "South Africa is one of the countries where you can be reasonably sure that there will be nobody stopping you," says Pawlowski. "So, this sort of thing adds up, and then it just becomes path dependent: stop-losses after stop-losses, and new levels, and so it goes."

ReutersWe've heard the stories from the old timers (B.C. â€” Before Crisis). Back in the day trading bonds, currencies and commodities used to make money for Wall Street hand over fist. That was then, and this is now. Fixed income, as such trading is called, is in the pits for everyone on the Street, but no one is feeling the burn worse than Morgan Stanley. According to the Wall Street Journal, that burn is leaving a scar. Morgan Stanley has decided to cull its fixed income unit and make it much smaller than its peers'. From the WSJ: During the dinner at Manhattan's fashionable SD26 restaurant, Colm Kelleher, Morgan Stanley's president of institutional securities, said the fixed-income unit would aim to pull in $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion in quarterly revenue, significantly less than the firm's peak of $3.39 billion in the first quarter of 2007, according to people familiar with the meeting. The unit generated $1.52 billion in revenue in the first quarter, excluding accounting adjustments. Morgan Stanley executives believe the lower revenue will help the firm focus on more profitable business. They are targeting a 10% return on equityâ€”a profitability yardstickâ€”across the firm. Last quarter, Morgan Stanley had a return on equity of 7.5%, well below Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s 12% and the 18% of J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co.'s investment bank. Bank analyst Mike Mayo said that he'd give Morgan Stanley's fixed income unit a D grade right now, and that he'd be pleased if they got it up to a C. That's brutal.
I listened to the interview of Christian Noyer, Governor of the Banque de France. His personal inclination is to oppose the use of a negative interest rate as a policy mechanism. He cited other cases to support his view. ECB President Mario Draghi mentioned the possibility of using a negative interest rate. That triggered the discussion. Negative interest rates are the ultimate in market distortions. They employ only a stick and no carrot. Their use tends to progress from disincentive through penalty to punishment. There is only a limited history of the use of negative interest rates. Many decades ago, Switzerland discouraged incoming Swiss-franc deposits by imposing a negative interest rate on balances placed with Swiss banks. In other words, a person deposited money in the bank, and the bank charged the depositor for the privilege of keeping it there. During the financial crisis in the US, the Bank of New York imposed a negative interest rate – a penalty – on deposits over $50 million. The bank essentially told customers to remove their money. Sweden’s central bank, the Sveriges Riksbank, also attempted a negative interest rate during the financial crisis but quickly reversed its policy. I had the opportunity to discuss the Swedish experience with the governor of the central bank at the Global Interdependence Center (GIC) meeting in Helsinki. Governor Stefan Ingves was quick to point out that benefits from negative interest rates did not seem to be observable. He did not get into the costs associated with negative interest rates, but he did affirm that it was unlikely that Sweden would use them again. In the US there is a question as to whether the existing, very low but still positive interest rates are too low. We have a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) fee in the US. It is assessed on assets of US-based banks. The FDIC fee is a formulaic approach that includes excess reserve deposits at the Federal Reserve (Fed), on which the Fed pays an interest rate of 25 basis points, or 0.25 percent. The differential between the excess reserve positive rate and the federal funds rate reflects a market that is attempting to find a clearing price of overnight liquidity transacted among and between banks. The federal funds rate is set below the excess reserve rate by market forces. A second distortion occurs in the US because Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and other Government-Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs) do not participate directly with reserve deposits at the Fed. Fannie Mae is not a bank; it has to sell its excess cash in the federal funds market at whatever interest rate it can obtain. That is how it earns something other than zero on its large excess cash flows. The buyers of Fannie Mae federal funds recycle the funds to the Fed as an excess reserve deposit. Buyers make an arbitrage profit less the cost that they incur in payments of the FDIC fee. The whole process in the US is even further distorted by the fact that US subsidiaries of foreign-owned banks are not subjected to the FDIC fee and operate with a different formula than US banks. The principle behind that rule is that the capital determinants of foreign banks are set by a different regime than for US banks. This distortion at the short end of the yield curve in these very-low-interest-rate times exacerbates difficulties in the formulation and implementation of monetary policy. In the midst of all this turbulence we now have a European brouhaha going on over negative interest rates. Our conclusion is that the likelihood of a negative interest rate being imposed by the ECB is near zero. It is not going to happen. Cooler heads will prevail at the ECB. At least we believe so. However, Europe has other serious issues with its banking system. It has not resolved the Eurozone-wide mechanism to secure insured deposits. It attempted to penalize insured depositors in the Cyprus affair and narrowly averted a disaster. It penalized uninsured depositors and is developing a system by which uninsured depositors will have a single standing and at least know the stratification of their claims on banks. That process has not yet been resolved. In the ECB and the Eurozone, we see a wounded banking system that is only slowly discussing the mechanisms of repair. Negative interest rates should not be one of them. In the US, we see distorted pricing and its impacts on our markets. These impacts are not fully understood by the general public. The public and most depositors are taking all deposits in the US for granted. They believe they are safe. However, the US is moving toward a bail-in rather than a bailout regime. The US and the FDIC in particular have affirmed that fact in documents that are diplomatically written but transparent to those who have eyes to see. At Cumberland, we are overweight banks. We believe that the supportive impacts of the Fed's bailout regime are still affecting US banks. We do not see a banking crisis in front of us in the near term, due to the huge excess liquidity provided by the Fed. It is hard to imagine how a banking crisis might occur when there is almost $2 trillion in excess reserves in the US banking system and over $5 trillion in excess banking reserves worldwide. We worry about the long term. The ranking order for depositor safety and the claims of bondholders, shareholders, and banks is a subject undergoing transition worldwide. Different jurisdictions are approaching this in different ways, and there is no global resolution yet. At this point we remain overweight in US financials, including big banks, regional banks, and insurance companies. We watch the developments and are seeing the markets improve. We worry, however, about the longer term.
Flickr/JaulaDeArdillaWomen with children should not trade stocks ... at least, not according to Paul Tudor Jones.Last week, the billionaire founder of hedge fund management company Tudor Investment set the Internet rant-o-sphere on fire when a video of him speaking at an investment symposium at the University of Virginia leaked out. Paul Tudor Jones (Getty Images)Among other impolitic statementscaught on tape, Jones was heard to have... Then, in a moment of self-reflection, Jones added: "I've probably said too much and gotten myself in trouble."Gee, Mr. Jones, Do You Think?!Well, yes, Mr. Jones. In all honesty, you probably did get yourself in a bit of hot water with the PC crowd.But that's OK. Because in the course of "opening mouth, inserting foot," you also opened the way for us to make another important observation: Maybe in the 1970s, when you first started trading stocks, people believed that women with children shouldn't trade stocks. Here in the 21st century, though, it's probably more accurate to say that no one should trade stocks. No humans, at least. Emphasis on the word "trade."These days, a person -- man or woman, childless or parent -- who wants to trade in and out of stocks isn't just competing with his fellow man (etc.). He's competing with professional traders at multinational megafirms, armed with limitless manpower, servers full of historical data to draw upon, and ranks of Bloomberg terminals to crunch the data. Any lone individual who thinks he can compete with all that, and win, is just plain crazy -- and it gets worse.You also have computers to worry about. Hedge-fund-run, turbocharged supercomputers, loaded with high-frequency trading algorithms that see a stock move and promptly execute 10,000 micro-trades on the Nasdaq at light speed ... all while you're still mousing over to the "buy it now" button.Trying to beat those odds -- whether you're a young new mom or a rich, middle-aged white guy with no kids and a degree from Wharton -- isn't just egotistical. It's downright suicidal.Play to Your StrengthsSo what's the average investor to do when faced with such long odds? Give up, log off, and resign yourself to having your savings earn 0.01 percent interest in a checking account? Hardly. Even if you can't succeed by trading stocks, you can still beat the market bigwigs by investing in stocks for the long-term. Remember: Research shows that despite all the manpower, data, and computers at their disposal, the average U.S. hedge fund still underperforms the S&amp;P 500 over both three- and 10-year historical time periods. While the "professionals" are scrabbling for pennies on the NYSE trading floor, focused on their performance minute-to-minute, they're ignoring the bigger picture.And that's where you have an advantage.If stock traders have an edge over the small investor in the short term, then over longer periods of time they're as likely as not to give up their short-term gains. Simply bybuying and holding a basic S&amp;P 500 index fund or ETF -- the SPDR S&amp;P 500 (SPY), for example -- you can short-circuit the supercomputers' advantages, and outperform the majority of hedge funds.When you get right down to it, Mr. Jones was more right than even he knew. Women with children shouldn't trade stocks. No one should trade stocks. But we can all do pretty well by investing in stocks.Motley Fool contributor Rich Smith does have kids, and doesn't trade stocks. He does, however, invest in them.
jekemp / FlickrLast September, one of the original institutional investors in the housing-to-rent strategy, multi-billion hedge fund Och-Ziff called it quits on the landlord business. The reason: "the New York-based hedge fund is looking to sell now because the returns it is generating from rental income are less than expected and it is looking to take advantage of a recent rebound in home prices in northern California." As a reminder, the REO-to-Rental subsidized investment program, which led to an epic surge in demand for multi-family housing, i.e., rental, units was, together with offshore investors parking their cash in the US for safekeeping (taking advantage of the NAR's anti-money laundering check exemptions)  and the big banks Foreclosure Stuffing, the key reason for the recent, stimulus-fueled and quite transitory bounce in house prices in assorted markets. Still, OZ's exit of the business did not spook too many of the other remaining investors who simply had no better investment options, and in a world of POMO and FOMO, they saw no choice but to become ever bigger landlords. Today, another one of the original "big boys" has called it curtains: "We just don’t see the returns there that are adequate to incentivize us to continue to invest", according to the CEO Bruce Rose of Carrington, one of the first investors to use deep institutional pockets (in this case a $450 million investment from OakTree) and BTFHousingD. Rose's assessment of the market? "There’s a lot of -- bluntly -- stupid money that jumped into the trade without any infrastructure, without any real capabilities and a kind of build-it-as-you-go mentality that we think is somewhat irresponsible." Of course, one can say exactly the same thing about virtually every other market where those gambling with "other people's money" have no choice but to ride the tide and dance as long as the music emanating from the Fed is playing. However, it is rare to see one (technically, another) voluntarily step out even as others are still locked into a market where the returns are no longer worth the effort. One such gambler is Blackstone: Blackstone Group LP (BX), the largest investor in single-family rentals, has spent $4.5 billion to amass more than 26,000 homes and continues to buy, according to Eric Elder, a spokesman for Invitation Homes, the rental housing division of the world’s largest private equity firm. Blackstone’s net yields on its occupied houses are about 6 percent to 6.5 percent, Jonathan Gray, the firm’s global head of real estate, said during a May 3 conference call with investors. That’s before using leverage from a $2.1 billion line of credit the private-equity giant arranged in March from a lending syndicate headed by Deutsche Bank AG. While about 85 percent of Blackstone’s renovated homes were leased, Gray said, “we’ve got an awful lot of homes to continue renovating.” Blackstone can have its homes: it's a different question if it will have the rental cash flow also needs to make these investments a reasonable investment. According to Carrington at least, the answer is a resounding no. And if people think the bottom will fall out of the market when the Fed pulls the curtain, just wait to see what happens to housing when the day comes that Blackstone announces it is shifting from the net buyer to net seller. Back to Carrington's rationale: Carrington, which started in 2003 as a mortgage investment fund and has managed almost 25,000 rental homes for itself and others, has been joined by hundreds of institutional and international investors buying single-family homes after prices plunged following the housing crash. The firms are building a new institutional real estate asset class from the 14 million leased single-family residences that are worth an estimated $2.8 trillion, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Even as demand for rentals rises amid a falling homeownership rate, yields are declining and companies formed to buy the homes that have gone public haven’t yet been profitable. Funds are buying property now, including homes sold by Carrington, for rents that yield 6 percent to 8 percent a year, before costs such as insurance, taxes and vacancies, according to Rose. Carrington’s model called for mid-single digit net returns on annual rents on an unlevered basis, according to Rose. While returns would vary by market, they would generally be in the mid- to high teens over the duration of the holding period, with the profit from home price appreciation. Others' experience justifies the logic: Colony American Homes Inc., a division of Thomas Barrack Jr.’s Colony Capital LLC, has found tenants for only 51 percent of the 9,931 homes it bought for $1.4 billion, according to a filing yesterday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. American Residential Properties Inc. (ARPI), a Scottsdale, Arizona-based real estate investment trust, and Silver Bay Realty Trust Inc., a New York-based single-family REIT, both reported losses in the quarter ending March 31. Owen Blicksilver, a spokesman for Colony Capital, declined to comment. Silver Bay CEO David Miller was unavailable to comment, according to Tricia Ross, a spokeswoman at Financial Profiles Inc. American Residential CEO Steve Schmitz and President Laurie Hawkes didn’t reply to e-mails seeking comment. If nothing else, everyone now knows where the incremental "bubble" demand for housing has come from: not from the distressed end user of thes properties, for whom as we showed yesterday, the disconnect between real income and new home sales has never been wider: it was all large institutions who invested OPM, and chased any upward moving price with the fervor of a rabid dog. But all things come to an end: “All the people who made money during the gold rush in California, they were selling the buckets and shovels,” Gordon said. “I think there is gold in them there hills, but you’re going to have to dig deep. And hopefully you’re going to need more than one shovel.” Carrington may start buying rental homes again when other large investors decide to sell after learning they can’t make returns that justify the prices they paid, Rose said. “We’ll sit back in the weeds for a while and wait for a couple of blowups,” he said. “There’ll be a point in time when we’ll be happy to get back into the market at levels that make more sense.” If the Chairman is serious about tapering, or even hinting of tightening at some point in the future, those blowups won't take too long. And so will the blowup in the illusion that the housing market is "recovering" on anything more than yet another cheap-money fueled bubble afforded to a select few who now have no choice but to "hot potato" properties amongst each other first on the way up, and soon, going down.
Elliot TwaroA former banker, who became mentally unstable after surviving a helicopter crash, spent millions on two strangers and his financial adviser did nothing to stop it, theÂ New York Post reports citing a lawsuit filed by the banker's lawyer brother/legal guardian.Â  According to the Post, the suit alleges that in 2010, Jeffrey Horan, who worked at Lehman Brothers and UBS, gave a New Jersey contractor a $460,000 Lamborghini and $600,000 to work on his Upper East Side apartment. The suit also alleges that Horan bought a Queens woman a $72,000 Mercedes and gave her $300,000.Â  What's more is his Bank of America financial adviser, who was aware of his mental condition, did nothing to stop it, the report said. The suit is seeking millions in damages from the two strangers, identified in the suit as Alex Gershkovich and Erika Oritz, as well as BofA, the report said.Â  According to the New York Daily News, Horan and a bunch of UBS execs were flying home from a Philadelphia 76ers game during the NBA playoffs in 2001 when the helicopter slammed into tree. Â Everyone on board, including the pilot, survived.Â  Ever since the crash, Horan started to go downhill mentally, the report said citing the suit.Â

flickr: Scripps National Spelling BeeWhen I was 11, my sister Karina went to the Scripps National Spelling Bee. She was 13. At the time she was one of the smartest people I knew. She still is. And she had to be. My family's from Pennsylvania â€” no half stepping, it's a big state and the competition is rough. The word she won on was 'gratinate'. I'll never forget it. After Karina won our regional Bee in Harrisburg, it was time to get serious for the national competition. The prep was insane. My parents are native Spanish speakers (from the Dominican Republic) so they knew they had to get her a tutor. Once they started asking around, though, they realized they needed to get her two. To get ready, Karina didn't just look up difficult words and memorize how to spell them. It was much more intense than that. She learned dead languages. She studied Greek and Latin roots. She studied them for hours. When kids hear a word they don't know at Scripps Bee, their minds race to break down how it may be spelled based on where the words come from â€” where they were born. That's why everyone asks the root of the word. It's not a stall tactic, it's a survival skill. The contestants know that Greek root words that make a Z sound are actually spelled with an X, for a simple example. So while I was practicing piano or playing soccer outside, my sister was raising the dead. Learning how to construct words she would never speak. I was in awe. She got a ton of attention, and I got to ride a limo to Washington. I wanted to be in the Bee. But it was a TON of work. I never did it. All in all, though, it has to be said that the best way to get to the Spelling Bee is simple â€” you read. You read constantly. You read everything. You don't get intimidated by a book that people say is above you reading level â€” you're a little kid, and you just crush it. That's what my sister did.
"Aggressive central bank actions in response to the bursting of one asset bubble often contribute to the creation of a new bubble," writes Michael Hartnett at Bank of America. Hartnett's referring to the Asian financial crisis, which begot the dotcom boom, which begot the recent housing and credit bubble. The recent financial crisis has prompted aggressive actions on the part of global central banks. And this has played out in surging bond prices and a collapsing yield. "In the past 6 years, central banks around the world have cut interest rates 515 times, increased global liquidity by $12 trillion and crushed bond yields to the point that almost 50% of all global government bond market cap currently trades below 1%. The stunning collapse in interest rates across debt markets in recent years is shown in Chart 3. For example, yields have dropped from 23% (Dec’08) to 5.6% today in High Yield Corporates, from 12% (Dec’08) to 4.5% today for EM $- denominated bonds and from 6% (Jun’07) to 2.6% today for Mortgage Backed Securities."

WikipediaIn honor of the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) examâ€”the notoriously hard Wall Street test happening this Saturdayâ€”we've been sharing some of the best horror stories from test-takers.Â  A commenter named Cameron gave us is a total nightmare scenario where he was in the Holland tunnel headed to New Jersey and realized he was supposed to take the test in Long Island. (Note: edited lightly for clarity):Â  "I took a company car with a fellow employee to New Jersey for level 1. He was taking the test at the Continental Arena. Midway through the Holland tunnel, I realized I was taking mine at the Nassau Coliseum. Cabbie dumped me off in Weehawken. Somehow, I called a cab service, he booked it to Long Island, and got me there just in time before doors closed. Heart attack city. I passed, I don't how, because I was shaking for the first hour of the test." Phew!Â 
U.S. Treasury bonds have sold off sharply in recent weeks, sending bond yields soaring upward. In recent days, the yield on the 10-year Treasury yield reached 2.17% – its highest levels in over a year – and is now trading near 2.12%. That puts the bonds in a bit of a "technical vacuum area" for traders charting yields, which just means it's been a while since the last time bonds were here, and there's not a lot of past experience to go off of in terms of recent action at these levels. In a note to clients, BofA Merrill Lynch technical analyst MacNeil Curry suggests traders should "STAY BEARISH" following the recent sharp move upward in yields. Curry writes: Across the US Treasury Curve, key support levels have broken. STAY BEARISH &amp; watch the monthly closes Across the US Treasury curve, 2yr, 5yr, 10yr and 30yr yields have broken key support levels, pointing to further upside in the sessions and weeks ahead. While allowing for a near-term consolidation, as 2s could struggle with 31.6bps/32bps area support, 10s are threatening to post a potential Shooting Star (warning of near-term stalling) and 30s are struggling with retracement support around 3.337%, any pullback/pause should prove temporary and corrective. Indeed, we look for the sell-off to continue, with 2s targeting 41bps, 5s to test 1.182%/1.257%, 10s to probe 2.292%/2.242% and 30s to take a run at 3.461%/3.504%. HOWEVER, the risks to this view are to the topside, as the monthly candlesticks warn that Treasuries are on the cusp of long-term/cyclical turns in trend. Indeed, all points on the curve are poised to complete Bearish Outside Months (watch the Friday close – see charts for levels), while 5s, 10s, and 30s are also on the verge of completing monthly head and shoulders bases, which would point to a return to levels not seen since 2011.

Here We Go Again On March 27, 2013, the Federal Housing Finance Administration (FHFA) announced the introduction of still another mortgage modification program.  Entitled the Streamlined Modification Program, it was intended to enable distressed borrowers to more easily qualify for a modification. Unlike the HAMP modification program, borrowers will not have to show any financial hardship whatsoever in order to qualify.  If their first lien is owned or guaranteed by either Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, the only requirement is that they be delinquent for 90 days or more and complete a 3-month trial period.  Also – they cannot be delinquent for more than two years and cannot have had two or more previous modifications. Nice deal, huh?  The obvious criticism is that it will only encourage borrowers to default in order to qualify.  FHFA’s answer is that it will minimize losses to Fannie and Freddie by reducing foreclosures.  Really? The program was supposed to begin on July 1.  But on May 12, FHFA announced that the program would become effective immediately.  Servicers are required to send modification offers to all eligible borrowers. The Failure of HAMP The government’s HAMP mortgage modification program was begun in the spring of 2009 at the height of the credit crisis.  Although they had expected it to help as many as 3 - 4 million distressed borrowers, only 816,000 permanent modifications were still outstanding at the end of March 2013. According to the latest report from the TARP Inspector General, more than 26% of all permanent modifications had already re-defaulted.  Over 1 million trial modifications had been canceled due to non-fulfillment of the terms by the borrower. As early as April 2010, the Congressional Oversight Panel reported that more than half of borrowers who had received a permanent modification under HAMP were seriously underwater.  Their average loan-to-value ratio (LTV) was 145%. Even worse, this percentage included only first mortgages.  The Obama Administration had estimated that roughly half of all at-risk borrowers were also saddled with second liens on their property.  So the true LTV for borrowers under HAMP was clearly much higher. Then in March of 2011, this same panel reported that recipients of permanent modifications were still badly underwater.  They also emphasized another serious problem.  After the modification, borrowers still had an average debt-to-income ratio (DTI) of 60%.  This meant that 60% of their total income was being spent on servicing their debts.  That debt burden was unsustainable for most homeowners. Mortgage Modification Problem Goes Well Beyond HAMP In June 2012, the credit reporting firm Trans Union issued the results of a study based on an examination of 600,000 borrowers from its enormous database who had received a mortgage modification between January 2008 and July 2011.  It found that nearly 6 out of every 10 borrowers had re-defaulted within 18 months after receiving the modification. The problem of re-defaults goes well beyond HAMP modifications.  There are roughly $900 billion securitized mortgages outstanding which are not guaranteed by Fannie or Freddie.  Take a good look at this shocking graph from TCW showing the re-default rate for loans modified in different years. TCW You can see that in the early years of modifications, nearly 80% have re-defaulted.  For the most recent years of 2010 – 2011, the percentage is already approaching 40% and headed higher. According to mortgage modification data provider HOPE NOW, more than 18 million mortgages have been either modified or provided with some so-called “workout solution.”  You can imagine what the percentage of mortgages considered seriously delinquent would be had these not occurred. Why Should This Time Be Different? The obvious question is why should the new streamlined modification program have results much different than the HAMP program or any of the others?  It will focus on the same pool of homebuyers who bought or refinanced during the bubble years of 2004 – 2007.  More than half of them own properties which are badly underwater and nearly half have second liens as well.  Is there any plausible reason to expect that borrowers who receive a modification under this program will re-default less than those with permanent HAMP modifications?  Perhaps those who dreamed up this new program really believe that the economy is strengthening.  As they see it, homeowners with a reduced mortgage burden will be less likely to default in an improving economic climate. Unfortunately, we have overwhelming evidence that underwater homeowners are much more likely to default than those who have equity remaining in the property.  As I have repeatedly shown, the number of homeowners who purchased or refinanced during the bubble years boggles the mind.  Take a look at this chart on refinancing originations during the bubble years of 2004 – 2006. Mortgagedataweb.com In these three years, 27 million mortgages were refinanced.  Regardless of whether the refinanced loan was a first mortgage or a second lien, the overwhelming majority of these properties are underwater.  That is the main pool of distressed borrowers whom the new modification will attempt to save.  The Terrible Burden of Second Mortgages To get a sense of the enormity of the problem with which this new modification program will try to grapple, you must begin to understand the second lien disaster.  In numerous articles, I have written about the burden of home equity lines of credit which has gone largely unreported by the media.  Let me briefly explain the problem.  During the crazy bubble years of 2004 – 2006, millions of homeowners took out second liens to tap the growing equity in their home.  Most were home equity lines of credit (HELOC).  In California, it was not uncommon for banks to provide HELOCs of $200,000 and up.   Some owners refinanced these HELOCs one or more times to pull still more cash out of their property.  In its 2004 report, the FDIC listed the ways in which banks were encouraging borrowers to open new HELOCs including providing automatic credit limit increases as the property increased in value.  To increase the use of existing HELOCs, banks were actually charging “nonuse fees” on lines that were open but inactive. Because qualifying standards were based primarily on the equity in the home, HELOCs were most attractive in those states where prices were rising rapidly – California, Nevada, Arizona and Florida.  Homes had become a money tree which their owners could shake almost at will. Homeowners opened an incredible number of HELOCs.  Take a look at this chart from Equifax showing the total HELOCs outstanding from March 2008 through March 2013.The green line shows that there were almost 15.5 million HELOCs outstanding in the nation at the peak. Equifax The green line shows that there were almost 15.5 million HELOCs outstanding in the nation at the peak. The lunacy of HELOC borrowing was most apparent in California.  During 2004 and 2005, a total of more than 1.4 million HELOCs were originated in California just for the purchase of homes according to figures I received from CoreLogic.  In those two years, borrowers in California would take out a HELOC to buy investment properties in other hot markets such as Las Vegas and Phoenix.  While the loans were recorded as California HELOCs because the borrower’s property was in California, the purchased home was actually in another state.  When the housing market finally began to decline in 2007, banks were very reluctant to accept this change.  They continued to shovel out millions of HELOCs.  Equifax reported that a total of 4.6 million new HELOCs were originated in 2007 and 2008.  As late as the fall of 2009, a study published by Equifax Capital Markets found that 45% of prime borrowers with securitized first mortgage loans that were still current in July 2009 also had a HELOC.  Worse yet, the average outstanding balance on these HELOCs increased steadily from roughly $83,000 in mid-2005 to $118,000 four years later. If you add in installment second liens, there are a total of roughly 15 million second mortgages still outstanding on homes throughout the nation.  I estimate that at least 90% of these properties are now underwater.  This situation is rarely discussed in the media but presents a problem that no modification program can solve. Moral Hazard Allowing or encouraging borrowers to become seriously delinquent in order to qualify for a mortgage modification has become known as moral hazard.  What sensible reason is there to eliminate the requirement that borrowers must show some financial hardship to qualify for a modification?  Doesn’t common sense tell us that some borrowers who can afford to pay their mortgage will strategically default so they can use this new program to obtain a better deal on the terms of their mortgage?  Apparently common sense does not play a role with the policy makers at FHFA. I have talked more than once to spokespersons for Fannie Mae on this moral hazard question.  Their answer is simply to give me the party line:  We are trying to help delinquent homeowners stay in their homes and avoid foreclosure.  Those investors who own these mortgages do not elicit the same concern by FHFA to get paid back what they are owed.

Less intentionally, the balloon symbolizes the sky-high cost of building the smelter and supplying it with electricity; Pinchukâ€™s growing billion-dollar debts; and the collapse of demand for the steel products Pinchuk is offering for sale in Ukraine and Russia, Interpipeâ€™s make-or-break markets. Although Interpipe remains privately held by Pinchuk, documents the company has prepared with his bankers to cover his debts, together with bank sources, reveal how strapped for cash Pinchuk is. The balloon is also going up for Pinchuk, as he tries to raise at least $143 million, perhaps ten times as much, from a claim filed in the UK High Court against two rival Ukrainian metals magnates, based on recollections of meetings Pinchuk and the others held in the Ukraine, Israel, Sardinia, and Switzerland, starting nine years ago.An unusual internet release by Pinchukâ€™s investment unit, EastOne, provides a four and a half-minute interview with Pinchukâ€™s lawyer, Oleg Mubarakshin, and a one-page text summarizing the London claim. This was filed,Â the text says, on March 12, 2013. A coordinated release of the material produced a spate of near-identical newspaper reports in the Ukraine, three in Russia, and one in London. According to the claim summary, in 2004, when Leonid Kuchma was President of Ukraine, an iron-ore mining company called Krivorozhskiy Zhelezorudnyy Kombinat (KZhRK) was privatized for $130 million. Pinchuk was Kuchmaâ€™s son-in-law. He claims that Gennady Bogolyubov and Igor Kolomoisky, two rival steelmakers and partners in the Privat banking group, agreed â€œthrough a qualifying entityâ€ to bid and buy the asset from the government. They then, allegedly, â€œundertook to transfer KZhRK to Mr Pinchuk upon being reimbursed the purchase price of $130 million plus a 10% ($13m) commission. Mr Pinchuk duly paid the full US$143 million but the asset was not transferred to him.â€ en.wikipedia.orgPinchuk says he took operational control of the mine. But in March of 2005 he was ousted by â€œpersons believed to have been acting on the instructions of the defendants [who] forcibly entered the premises of KZhRK and took control of the plant.â€ Another eighteen months elapsed, and then on September 4, 2006, the trio allegedly met together. What happened next is the core of Pinchukâ€™s lawsuit: Bogolyubov and Kolomoisky, according to Pinchuk, â€œdeclared a trust in respect of KZhRK in favour of Mr Pinchuk, and gave him various undertakings regarding its transfer. In breach of trust and contract, Mr Bogolyubov and Mr Kolomoisky have failed to transfer KZhRK to its rightful owner, Mr Pinchuk, and it appears that they may have sold approximately 50% of KZhRK to a third party in 2007.â€ Rinat Akhmetov, another Ukrainian metals magnate and owner of four steelmills, is identified by Pinchuk as the buyer of that stake in KZhRK. Pinchuk is also claiming that Akhmetov is a witness to the deal-making he undertook with Bogolyubov and Kolomoisky. Mubarakshin â€” a Moscow-trained lawyer who worked for the beer group Inbev before joining Pinchuk â€” identifies in his video clip â€œrepeated promisesâ€, and a great deal of talking. â€œFor years and yearsâ€, Mubarakshin said, â€œwe tried over and over again, but every attempt at reaching agreement failed [because] Mr Bogolyubov and Mr Kolomoisky didnâ€™t do what they said they would do.â€ White &amp; Case are the solicitors for Pinchuk, led by David Goldberg, a Russia case specialist. The barrister is Antony Grabiner QC, appointed a baron in 1999. Recently, Grabiner has been engaged to defend Rupert Murdochâ€™s News Limited against charges of illegal hacking and bribery of police. Mubarakshin was asked to identify the place where the Ukrainians met in September 2006 for the meeting on which Pinchukâ€™s contract and trust claims depend. He and the court papers confirm it was Geneva. According to the 23-page Particulars of Claim, filed by Pinchukâ€™s lawyers, what was said in Geneva was â€œan oral agreementâ€¦in part evidenced in writingâ€. There was also a handshake. But the Pinchuk group declines through its spokesman at Maitland, a London public relations firm, to make available a copy of signed documents of contract or trust which Pinchuk is alleging to have been breached. Pinchukâ€™s lawyers also reveal that Bogolyubov wasnâ€™t at the Geneva meeting, so there is no evidence that he shook hands or participated in what was said. See Section 31, page 11 of the Particulars of ClaimÂ here. Briefed independently, the Financial Times (FT) cites Pinchuk himself as conceding the evidence for his claim â€œwas mainly made verbally.â€ The FT also cautioned that â€œthe risk of a dispute centered on verbal agreements was laid bare in the case of [Boris] Berezovsky.â€ The FT report conveys doubt â€œif the case reaches trialâ€. The itemization in the court papers of the meetings Pinchuk believes will substantiate his $143 million deal refers to â€œoral agreementâ€, the terms of which allegedly depend on the recollection of witnesses. These include the principals, their employees, go-betweens, and in one meeting, an Israeli rabbi named Shmuel Kaminetskiy. Bogolyubov is not commenting, and neither is his law firm Freshfields. Independent sources believe there was a meeting in Geneva between Pinchuk and Kolomoisky. But they say there is documented evidence that it was impossible for there to have been any trust, let alone a shareholding contract, between them at the time. The sources identify a substantial claim filed in US federal court in Boston by Kolomoisky in March of 2006, charging Pinchuk with fraud, money laundering, and racketeering in relation to another Ukrainian asset, the Nikopol Ferro-Alloy Plant. In that case, Pinchuk, an American cousin of his, and a second American, along with Interpipe and associated trading companies, were accused of an elaborate asset and trading scheme, which depended in the first instance on Pinchukâ€™s closeness through his wife, Elena Kuchma, to the Ukrainian president. â€œIn 2002,â€ one of the court submissions alleges, â€œ Pinchuk, as President Kuchmaâ€™s future son-in-law, was able to exercise effective control of Nikopol. Using his family connections, Pinchuk caused Nikopol to enter into a series of self-dealing contracts clearly designed to siphon hundreds of millions of dollars of Nikopolâ€™s profits annually to entities controlled and/or beneficially owned by Pinchuk, Margulis, and/or Novack. These contracts caused Nikopol to (a) purchase raw materials (ore) at above market prices from entities related to Pinchuk, Margulis, and Novack and sell the finished product at below market prices to entities also controlled by Pinchuk, Margulis, and Novack; and (b) enter into unnecessary, profit-skimming tolling contracts, whereby Nikopol was paid a fee for processing ore, while other companies controlled by Pinchuk, Margulis, and Novack reaped the profits associated with selling the finished product on the open market.â€ The illegal scheme, alleges the Boston court claim, dated March 30, 2006, involved â€œracketeering activity, including wire fraud, and, upon information and belief, acts of bribery (in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act), money laundering, foreign travel in aid of racketeering, and illegal monetary transactions.â€ Pinchuk himself was charged with having â€œused Kuchmaâ€™s influence to extort Ukrainian officials and secure their cooperation and assistance in carrying out the schemes.â€ Privatization of Nikopol in Pinchukâ€™s favour, according to a source cited in the US court documents, resulted in Pinchuk paying $80 million for an asset reportedly worth $1 billion. Details of allegedly fraudulent trading schemes are provided in the dossier; these continued through 2004 and 2005, and followed the victorious presidential election campaign by Victor Yushchenko, who took power early in 2005. Loss to Nikopol of several hundred million dollars, plus treble damages under the US racketeering statute, were sought. The case was settled out of court, however, and the lawyers involved say they cannot comment. The new Pinchuk filing in the High Court reveals that the confidential settlement between Kolomoisky and Pinchuk occurred on November 22, 2006. In Pinchukâ€™s London filing, he claims the Boston case was directly connected to the KZhRK deal. â€œThe Defendants [Bogolyubov and Kolomoisky] sought to impose pressure on the Claimant [Pinchuk] to agree to their proposals by procuring the institution on 30 March 2006 of proceedings by certain of their companies (namely Athina, Varkedge and Wisewood) against the Claimant in Massachusetts, USA, in which spurious allegations and claims were advanced under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations Act.â€ Why in parallel, between 2004 and the meeting on September 2006, Kolomoisky and Bogolyubov would, as Pinchuk charges, trust him with shares to the KZhRK remains to be clarified. Pinchuk is now alleging that the others broke the Nikopol settlement agreement, accusing them of having â€œacted in breach of the Claimantâ€™s rights under the Constitution and the Beneficiaries Agreement in relation to the Ferroalloy Holding.â€ This claim, which has not been litigated before, is excluded from the ZhRK claim. Mubarakshin was asked why Pinchuk didnâ€™t buy the shares himself from the government. He responded through a spokesman that Ukrainian privatization rules at the time required that bidders for KZhRK had to qualify to buy the asset by holding at least 25% in the group from which KZhRK was being sold. Pinchuk didnâ€™t qualify; he claims Bogolyubov and Kolomoisky did. The record of meetings which followed over the next nine years names 15 witnesses. By attacking the record of the US court case, and opening up its confidential terms, Pinchuk is putting his credibility in the US to an unusual test. That credibility is also exposed to scrutiny in records filed at the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) bureau of the US Department of justice. These reveal that Pinchuk is currently paying an American lobbyist $40,000 per month to arrange meetings for him with high US officials, such as Hillary Clinton when she was Secretary of State. Clinton appears to have refused an attempt Pinchuk financed last year to promote a Ukrainian election endorsement by Clinton by meeting â€œwith Arseny Yatsenuk, leader of the United Opposition, during the week of September 3, 2012 regarding democratization and free and fair elections in the Ukraine.â€ Pinchuk has promoted his wealth through Forbes, which claims he is worth about $3.8 billion, based on estimates about Interpipe. According to Forbes, â€œthe majority of his wealth comes from traditional pipe manufacturing; this past year, his Interpipe launched a $700 million steel plant, the first such plant build from scratch in Ukraine since 1991. Other parts of his diversified empire have not fared as well.â€ Pinchuk refers to himself in the court documents, together with Bogolyubov and Kolomoisky, as â€œbillionaire Ukrainian businessmenâ€. Pinchukâ€™s claims unexpectedly invite an accounting of his financial position, net of debt. Interpipe says its financial report for 2012 has been delayed, and there are no IFRS interim reports since the July 4, 2012, publication ofÂ the 2011 results. An analysis of the 2011 financial report indicates that Interpipe depends on Ukraine for 36% of its revenues, 25% on Russia; it was much the same in 2010. The asset concentration is even more dependent â€“ 92% in Ukraine. The gross debt identified in the report is $1.026 billion. At page 41 of the 2011 financial report, it appears that Interpipeâ€™s banks have tried to secure themselves against the disappearance of trade proceeds by requiring Pinchuk to implement two cash pledges of $270 million and $160 million â€œarising out of certain intra-group sales contractsâ€ and between trading subsidiaries and â€œtheir ultimate customersâ€. Combined, those pledges represent 26% of the sales revenue reported for 2011. As a condition of Interpipeâ€™s bank debt restructuring terms, an override agreement with the banks also required Pinchuk to pay $65 million in fresh capital into Interpipe, plus a $40 million letter of credit â€“ see Note 17. The terms also barred payment of dividends to Pinchuk (page 41). What therefore can be Pinchukâ€™s income if he has been denied dividends from Interpipe since 2010? The evidence to answer that question is scanty, but it raises the possibility, made explicit by the Financial Times, that like Boris Berezovskyâ€™s attempt to sue in the High Court for cash from Roman Abramovich, Pinchuk is trying a similar stratagem. The 2011 financial report indicates Interpipeâ€™s earnings (Ebita) for 2010 to be $169.5 million; $255.5 million for 2011. By calculating Pinchukâ€™s â€œnet worthâ€ as of March 2013 at $3.8 billion, Forbes is in effect calculating the market value of Interpipe at $3.8 billion. Assuming the 2012 Ebita to be not less than the 2011 figure, this suggests an Ebita-market cap multiple for Interpipe of 15x. This looks to be an exaggeration. TMK, Russiaâ€™s leading pipemaker, is an obvious peer for comparison, even though it is four times larger than Interpipe by sales revenue. For TMK the ratio of Ebita to market cap is around 3.5x. The Forbes calculation of the â€œnet worthâ€ of Dmitry Pumpyansky, the control shareholder of TMK, is reported to be $2.2 billion. This Forbes calculation is a direct extrapolation from Pumpyanksyâ€™s 70% shareholding in TMK. Comparing the Forbes calculations for Pumyansky and Pinchuk, the Pinchuk number appears to be unlikely. It is evident from Interpipeâ€™s financials that Pinchuk is running an enormous financial risk on the revenue and profitability of the new EAF plant, and the capacity of the markets to absorb its products. This in turns depends on the currently depressed prospects for pipes and other steel products in the Ukraine, in Turkey, Russia and other export markets; on the reaction of rival Ukrainian consumers of the extra steel scrap Pinchukâ€™s new mill requires; and on Pinchukâ€™s efforts to hold down the price and profitability of the scrap business. According to Ukrainian sources, Interpipe currently depends on high-cost electricity supplied to Pinchuk by Akhmetov, whose testimony will be sought by both sides if the case goes to trial. The record presented so far by Pinchuk fails to identify a link to the UK for the assets in dispute, or the meetings allegedly held to settle on terms. The language the principals and their witnesses used appears to have been Russian. The little paperwork to which Pinchukâ€™s court claim refers was not in English, and according to the Particulars of Claim, it was drafted after the September 2006 meeting by Yulia Chebotaryova, an employee of Pinchukâ€™s since 1993 and currently chief operating officer of his investment unit,EastOne. Despite the acknowledgement in the court papers that Bogolyubov was absent from the key Geneva meeting in 2006, jurisdiction is held by the London court over the three Ukrainians and the Ukrainian mine, according to Pinchukâ€™s lawyer, because â€œMr Bogolyubov is based in Londonâ€ and also because â€œthe claim against [Kolomoisky] is so closely connected with the claim against Mr Bogolyubov that it is appropriate they should be heard together.â€ The claim documents submitted by Pinchukâ€™s lawyers go one step further, arguing that when the meeting was held in Geneva Kolomoisky and the absent Bogolyubov agreed to be governed by UK law. Back in 2006 that was Pinchukâ€™s idea. â€œFollowing a suggestion by the Claimant [Pinchuk], the parties orally agreed that any disputes regarding the Constitution [deal terms] would be dealt with by the English Courts applying English law.â€ Whether Pinchuk can prove that or not, his lawyers have a fall-back position. This is that Bogolyubov is domiciled in London, though a source close to the Pinchuk side conceded that this may not have been the case when the September 2006 meeting took place. A recent court caseÂ initiated by Elena Pinchuk, Pinchukâ€™s wife, may be a portent of whatâ€™s to come in London. In that case, which went through US arbitration and the courts for six years, a Cyprus company controlled by Mrs Pinchuk refused to pay a Washington landscape architect $170,000 (rounded) for work on the grounds of the family home at a former state sanatorium near Kiev. The architect counter-claimed, and by the time the affair was settled this past January, the bill for the Pinchuks came to more than $500,000.
Yes, ETFs are derivatives, but the people hustling these things will never tell you that nor acknowledge that theyâ€™re selling derivatives.Â  On the spectrum of derivatives, ETFs are relatively benign, but history tells us that all derivatives are relatively benign until something unforeseen goes terribly wrong. Most ETFs seek to mimic the investment performance of an equity index, no different than a traditional index mutual fund.Â  In a traditional index mutual fund, the fund manger buys or sells the proportionate amount of securities represented in the underlying index.Â  The price of the shares is determined by the actual value of the underlying securities the fund owns; itâ€™s pretty straight forward. But with ETFs things are far more complicated.Â  ETF share prices are derived by a complex, behind the scenes process.Â  ETF pricing is totally dependent on multiple third parties, known as Authorized Participants, or APs (generally large financial institutions).Â Â  APs engage in a continuous process of trading â€œcreation unitsâ€ directly with the ETF fund manager.Â  Using technology driven trading techniques, like high frequency trading, the APs effectively trade against the ETF all day, pocketing the discrepancies between the ETFâ€™s market price and the ETFâ€™s net asset value. Proponents of ETFs are quick to highlight how these securities have â€œdemocratizedâ€ financial markets by making it easier for individuals to invest, particularly in things like commodities.Â  When we hear these claims we canâ€™t help but recognize that democratizing a market is generally a key ingredient in the formation of an asset bubble.Â  Recall how easy it was for anyone with a pulse to get a mortgage to buy homes that they couldnâ€™t afford â€“ how did that end?Â  And just as ETFs make it easy to invest, they also make it easy to liquidate investments, just ask anyone who has owned gold ETFs over the past several months. As for commodity ETFs, investors need to forget the idea that theyâ€™re investing in real assets via an ETF.Â  Yes, the value of their commodity ETF is derived from the price of the tracked commodity.Â  In theory (at least in the short term) the ETF price should track the commodity price.Â  But make no mistake, ETFs are financial assets, they are not real assets.Â  These derivative securities allow you to track the performance, but youâ€™ll never get your hands on the underlying commodity being tracked.Â  The real damage ETFs have inflicted on investors lies in investment performance. By embracing ETFs, active managers have wholeheartedly embraced indexing.Â  We donâ€™t have anything against indexing, in fact in most cases itâ€™s the right way to go.Â  But remember that the only reason an investor pays an active manager is to get investment returns above and beyond the index.Â  When active management strategies heavily rely on the use of ETFs, investors get stuck with indexed returns, with very little chance for relative out performance. For years, active managers have vehemently denied that they shadow their respective index benchmarks.Â  They fought the case for indexing tooth and nail.Â  But ETFs have turned out to be the active managersâ€™ solution to indexing; itâ€™s a classic case of if you canâ€™t beat them join them.Â  Gone are the days when many firms would highlight the ability of their research departments, and how, through diligent research, they could deliver exceptional investment returns. Active equity management has evolved into a mindless exercise of picking sectors via ETFs, i.e., indexing.Â  Investors, seeking positive relative investment returns, continue to pay for active management, but what they need to understand is that they are just indexing with a handicap.Â  Of course active managers love indexing because they donâ€™t need to pay a team of high priced analysts just to pick ETFs. Indexing makes great sense, but what will happen to investment returns when everyone throws in the towel and just indexes?Â  In our view, when everyone crowds into the same trade, returns get muted (and we get the feeling that weâ€™re quickly heading in that direction).Â  That will be the time to abandon indexing (including ETFs) and put together good old-fashioned equity portfolios, one issue at a time.Â  Does anybody remember how to do that?
I have given a friend a task lately to come up with a consistent theory explaining recent moves in markets. I said it could be a conspiracy theory, a preposterous theory or any-other-theory as long as it provides a consistent explanation of recent moves. His reply was â€œpeople are selling what they were very long ofâ€ but then he reflected and said that it wouldnâ€™t be consistent with the equity rally. While I do not aspire to give you a comprehensive explanation, I think I have one that at least I feel comfortable with. But letâ€™s start with a snapshot of whatâ€™s going on: Now, it may well be the case that weâ€™re simply experiencing a risk-off period, although Iâ€™m not sure equity and commodities markets would agree with that fully. Neither is the UST sell-off the first thing that springs to mind when discussing the dreaded risk-off. A theory, which is a bit closer to my heart is what Paul Krugman put in his blogÂ todayÂ but again the USD is not really rallying. Alternatively, stuff like the Mexican peso shouldnâ€™t be under so much pressure in such a scenario, I reckon. I see two main forces driving the market at the moment. The first one is the Bank of Japan. In my postÂ Eddie Vedder and the Japanese carryÂ from April 13 (USD/JPY approaching 100Â ) I was being skeptical about the whole concept of yen being used to fund stuff elsewhere saying that the Japanese will probably find plenty of opportunities locally if they believe in Abenomics. However, I did also say that if anything theyâ€™d go for bonds in the US, which are looking considerably better than other global bonds on a currency-hedged basis. Similarly, if a Japanese investor wants to bet on the yen decline, then they should keep it simple and do USD/JPY rather than, say, AUD/JPY. And this is a very important point because whenever USDJPY jumps 1%, it pushes the USD index higher by almost 0.15%, thus creating the impression that the risk is off because the USD strengthens. Therefore, the previous correlation of â€œyen lower, risk higherâ€ does not work like a charm anymore. But then, if itâ€™s just a localised intervention in USD/JPY, which has very little to do with the fundamentals in the US of A then perhaps it is safe to assume that some investors have been skewing their own USD index by buying a bit more USD against the JPY and selling the greenback against the EUR? I will explain in a second why. A global bond investor, which has a WGBI index as a benchmark (thatâ€™s representative of around 3-4trn USD in AUM) has 23 countries to choose from. These include the bond behemoths like US, Germany, Japan or Italy but also smaller markets, mostly in Europe. And the way this investor looks at the world at the moment is as follows.  Â  I would like to spend a second on the EUR here. In one of my recent discussions with long-term investors an interesting theme started taking shape â€“ what if Europe is about to experience what Japan had experienced in the last two decades but in a very short period of time, say 1-2 years? The current account is very positive, the appetite for debt is relatively strong and domestic demand will stay very sluggish but at the same the ECB wonâ€™t go â€œfull montyâ€ on printing. Unless it is forced to do so, of course, like it recently happened in Japan. What if the balance of payments forces coupled by the fact that virtually every major trading partner of the Eurozone is printing money push EUR to some ridiculously high levels before the pressure on the ECB is so strong that it canâ€™t resist it anymore? So yes, the EUR would eventually crash but there would be a lot of stop losses beforehand. I will be very honest â€“ I am really struggling to get a good feel on the market at the moment. There are bond markets that I still like a lot, e.g. Italy, CEE or Russia but I think one needs to have something to offset the long rates exposure (my suggestion â€“ Turkey). I generally think emerging markets in the EU should outperform Latam and Asia due to proximity to the deflationary vortex but moves have been quite brutal there, too. On the FX, if what I wrote is correct then the theme from the beginning of the year, i.e. being long EUR/MXN, EUR/RUB or EUR/MYR should work out really nicely. And yes, I know this post wouldâ€™ve been nice to have two weeks ago but this is what I make of it all anyway. Editor's note: This post was originally published on May 29 at barnejek.wordpress.com.
China's extreme manufacturing of solar panels caused a massive supply glut, and a lot of American solar companies had it rough in 2012. This year, however, has been a different story.Â  SunPower, First Solar, and Elon Musk's Solar City have been on a tear lately, with their stock prices surging 50% - 300%. Here's their chart YTD: Yahoo In a research note today, Goldman Sachs' Brian Lee, Thomas Daniels and Britt Boril explain why: they're focusing more on projects rather than parts, and they've pulled out of Europe:Â  The key change within US solars, in our view, has been an evolution of business models to downstream, project businesses. As fundamentals have shifted away from manufacturing, supply-demand and component ASP debates toward backlog and pipelines, we believe earnings have stabilized, with visibility now firm over the next 12-18 months. Also, a geographic mix shift away from Europe toward North America and emerging markets such as Japan, India, South America, and the M. East has reduced policy risk.Â  Here's the evolution in sales data... Goldman Sachs And here's the new geographic breakdown... Goldman Sachs

Randy Son Of Robert, FlickrPending home sales climbed 0.3% month-over-month in April. This missed expectations for a 1.5% rise. On a yearly basis they were up 13.9%, beating expectations for a 13.9% rise. â€œThe housing market continues to squeak out gains from already very positive conditions.Â  Pending contracts so far this year easily correspond to higher closed home sales in 2013," said Lawrence Yun NAR chief economist in a press release. A regional breakdown showed that the pending home sales index (PHSI) increased the most in the Northeast, up 11.5% on the month, and 17.7% on the year. The PHSI fell the most in the West, down 7.6% on the month and 2.6% on the year. March's reading was revised up modestly to show a 5.9% year-over-year rise. Here's a look at how pending home sales have done since 2001: NAR
Financials are now the best performing major sector in the market this year, after a very strong week on a relative basis. Â The financial sector, as measured by XLF, is up 21.5% in 2013, while the former leader, health care (XLV), is up 18.5%. Here is the 1 year chart of XLF (courtesy of Bloomberg): I donâ€™t even need to draw the trendline â€“ thatâ€™s about as steady a trend as youâ€™ll find. Â The 50 day ma (pink) has acted as support on a couple occasions in 2013, and XLF hasnâ€™t touched its 100 (green) or 200 day (black) maâ€™s since November 2012, more than 6 months ago. So the technicals show a clear, strong uptrend, with the 50 day ma at 18.75 an obvious buy point on a pullback. Â What about the fundamentals? Hereâ€™s a quick analysis of the top components of XLF: Those 5 names make up almost 40% of the XLF ETF, and theyâ€™re all up substantially on the year. Hereâ€™s the thing about financials â€“ they look much cheaper than the rest of the market. Â Of course, thatâ€™s for good reason, given the past volatility of their earnings stream, the overhang of new regulations, and the massive leverage of their balance sheets. Â But in an environment where utilities and staples stocks are trading at 20 P/E valuations, investors are more and more willing to give this sector the benefit of the doubt, particularly when the valuation gap is so large. As long as systemic risk emanating from European banks remains subdued, financials should have the all-clear signal to continue to outperform the broader market, given the strong capital markets backdrop and their cheaper valuations than other sectors. Â In that sense, holders of U.S. financials names should keep a close eye on the price action in the European banks. Full Disclosure â€“ as a former employee, Goldman Sachs is my largest personal stock position. Â

This morning, the Bureau of Economic Analysis lowered its estimate for Q1 GDP to +2.4%, from an earlier reading of +2.5%. Among the interesting details was corporate profits after tax, which came in at -1.9%.Â  Economists were looking for +0.2%. This was the first negative reading since Q1 2012. One of the big concerns in the markets today is that stocks have trended higher even as earnings growth expectations have stagnated. While U.S. corporate profits are not the same as S&amp;P 500 corporate profits, today's report is nevertheless worrisome as the U.S. has been one of the healthier economies in the developed world. Here's the table and text from the BEA: BEA Corporate ProfitsÂ Â Â Â Â  Profits from current production (corporate profits with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments) decreased $43.8 billion in the first quarter, in contrast to an increase of $45.4 billion in the fourth.Â  Current-production cash flow (net cash flow with inventory valuation adjustment) - - the internal funds available to corporations for investment -- increased $110.9 billion in the first quarter, in contrast to a decrease of $89.8 billion in the fourth.Â Â Â Â Â  Taxes on corporate income decreased $13.6 billion in the first quarter, compared with a decrease of $4.4 billion in the fourth.Â  Profits after tax with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments decreased $30.2 billion in the first quarter, in contrast to an increase of $49.8 billion in the fourth.Â  Dividends decreased $101.7 billion in contrast to an increase of $124.3 billion. The large fourth-quarter increase reflected accelerated and special dividends paid by corporations at the end of 2012 in anticipation of changes to individual income tax rates.Â  Current-production undistributed profits increased $71.4 billion, in contrast to a decrease of $74.3 billion.Â Â Â Â Â  Domestic profits of financial corporations decreased $2.0 billion in the first quarter, compared with a decrease of $3.5 billion in the fourth.Â  Domestic profits of nonfinancial corporations decreased $8.8 billion in the first quarter, in contrast to an increase of $24.8 billion in the fourth.Â  In the first quarter, real gross value added of nonfinancial corporations increased, and profits per unit of real value added decreased.Â  The decrease in unit profits reflected an increase in the unit nonlabor costs incurred by corporations that was partly offset by a decrease in unit labor costs; unit prices were unchanged.Â Â Â Â Â  The rest-of-the-world component of profits decreased $33.0 billion in the first quarter, in contrast to an increase of $24.1 billion in the fourth.Â  This measure is calculated as (1) receipts by U.S. residents of earnings from their foreign affiliates plus dividends received by U.S. residents from unaffiliated foreign corporations minus (2) payments by U.S. affiliates of earnings to their foreign parents plus dividends paid by U.S. corporations to unaffiliated foreign residents.Â  The first-quarter decrease was accounted for by a decrease in receipts and an increase in payments.Â Â Â Â Â  Profits before tax decreased $49.8 billion in the first quarter, in contrast to an increase of $27.3 billion in the fourth.Â  The before-tax measure of profits does not reflect, as does profits from current production, the capital consumption and inventory valuation adjustments.Â  These adjustments convert depreciation of fixed assets and inventory withdrawals reported on a tax-return, historical-cost basis to the current-cost measures used in the national income and product accounts.Â  The capital consumption adjustment increased $12.9 billion in the first quarter (from -$199.5 billion to -$186.6 billion), compared with an increase of $0.5 billion in the fourth.Â  The inventory valuation adjustment decreased $6.9 billion (from -$9.2 billionÂ  to -$16.1 billion), in contrast to an increase of $17.6 billion.Â Â  Â The first-quarter changes in taxes on corporate income and in the capital consumption adjustment mainly reflect the expiration of bonus depreciation claimed under the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012.Â  For detailed data, see the table "Net Effects of the Tax Acts of 2002, 2003, 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2012 on Selected Measures of Corporate Profits" at www.bea.gov/national/xls/technote_tax_acts.xls.Â  Profits from current production are not affected because they do not depend on the depreciation-accounting practices used for federal income tax returns; rather, they are based on depreciation of fixed assets valued at current cost using consistent depreciation profiles based on used-asset prices. For more details on the effect of tax act provisions on the capital consumption adjustment, see FAQ #999 on the BEA Web site, "Why does the capital consumption adjustment for domestic business decline so much in the first quarter of 2012?".
The Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) exam is this Saturday and test-takers are probably freaking out. The CFA, which has three levels, is considered to be the most difficult test on Wall Street with fewer thanÂ 20 percent of candidatesÂ passing all three on the first try. TheÂ average test-taker also spends a solid five to six months preparing for the CFA. That's not the only reason they'd be freaking out, though. Every test-taker hopes things go smoothly and according to plan, but we've heard some crazy horror stories. We've included them here. Â Make sure this doesn't happen to you.Â 
Elon Musk says he will elaborate this afternoon on recent comments he made regarding Tesla's charging network. Here's the Tweet: Important details about the Tesla Supercharger Network to be unveiled later today at 10:30am California time At the AllThingsD conference this week, Musk said it will soon be possible to drive from New York to L.A. using Tesla's charging network. Tesla is planning "a dramatic acceleration of the Supercharging network," he said. "It'll be tripled. We'll put the map live tomorrow."
Library of Congress, Prints & Photographs Division, FSA-OWI Collection This was not a great number. Initial jobless claims spiked to 354K from 340K last week. 340K was expected. Of course, this is a volatile number, and still in the same general range. So, no reason to read too much into this.
REUTERS/Keith BedfordThe second estimate for first quarter U.S. GDP is out. Q1 GDP growth was revised down to 2.4% from the initial 2.5% estimate published a month ago. Economists were expecting the number to come in unchanged at 2.5%. Personal consumption growth, however, was revised up to 3.4% from 3.2%. The consensus estimate was for a smaller upward revision to 3.3%. Below is the full text of the release: Real gross domestic product -- the output of goods and services produced by labor and propertyÂ located in the United States -- increased at an annual rate of 2.4 percent in the first quarter of 2013 (thatÂ is, from the fourth quarter to the first quarter), according to the "second" estimate released by the BureauÂ of Economic Analysis. In the fourth quarter, real GDP increased 0.4 percent. The GDP estimate released today is based on more complete source data than were available forÂ the "advance" estimate issued last month. In the advance estimate, real GDP increased 2.5 percent. With the second estimate for the first quarter, increases in private inventory investment, in exports, andÂ in imports were less than previously estimated, but the general picture of overall economic activity is notÂ greatly changed (for more information, see "Revisions" on page 4). BOX.______ Comprehensive Revision of the National Income and Product Accounts BEA plans to release the results of the 14th comprehensive (or benchmark) revision of the nationalÂ income and product accounts (NIPAs) in conjunction with the second quarter 2013 "advance" estimateÂ on July 31, 2013. More information on the revision is available on BEAâ€™s Web site atÂ www.bea.gov/gdp-revisions. An article in the March 2013 issue of the Survey of Current BusinessÂ discusses the upcoming changes in definitions and presentations, and an article in the May SurveyÂ describes the changes in statistical methods. An article in the September Survey will describe theÂ estimates in detail. Revised NIPA table stubs and news release stubs will be available in June. FOOTNOTE.______ Quarterly estimates are expressed at seasonally adjusted annual rates, unless otherwise specified. Quarter-to-quarter dollar changes are differences between these published estimates. Percent changes areÂ calculated from unrounded data and are annualized. "Real" estimates are in chained (2005) dollars. PriceÂ indexes are chain-type measures. This news release is available on BEA's Web site along with the Technical NoteÂ and Highlights related to this release. For information on revisions, see "Revisions to GDP, GDI, and Their Major Components". ________________ The increase in real GDP in the first quarter primarily reflected positive contributions fromÂ personal consumption expenditures (PCE), private inventory investment, residential fixed investment,Â nonresidential fixed investment, and exports that were partly offset by negative contributions fromÂ federal government spending and state and local government spending. Imports, which are a subtractionÂ in the calculation of GDP, increased. The acceleration in real GDP in the first quarter primarily reflected an upturn in privateÂ inventory investment, an acceleration in PCE, a smaller decrease in federal government spending, andÂ an upturn in exports that were partly offset by an upturn in imports and a deceleration in nonresidentialÂ fixed investment. Motor vehicle output added 0.28 percentage point to the first-quarter change in real GDP afterÂ adding 0.18 percentage point to the fourth-quarter change. Final sales of computers added 0.02Â percentage point to the first-quarter change in real GDP after adding 0.10 percentage point to the fourth-quarter change. The price index for gross domestic purchases, which measures prices paid by U.S. residents,Â increased 1.2 percent in the first quarter, 0.1 percentage point more than in the advance estimate; thisÂ index increased 1.6 percent in the fourth quarter. Excluding food and energy prices, the price index forÂ gross domestic purchases increased 1.4 percent in the first quarter, compared with an increase of 1.2Â percent in the fourth. Real personal consumption expenditures increased 3.4 percent in the first quarter, compared withÂ an increase of 1.8 percent in the fourth. Durable goods increased 8.2 percent, compared with an increaseÂ of 13.6 percent. Nondurable goods increased 2.2 percent, compared with an increase of 0.1 percent.Â Services increased 3.1 percent, compared with an increase of 0.6 percent. Real nonresidential fixed investment increased 2.2 percent in the first quarter, compared with anÂ increase of 13.2 percent in the fourth. Nonresidential structures decreased 3.5 percent, in contrast to anÂ increase of 16.7 percent. Equipment and software increased 4.6 percent, compared with an increase ofÂ 11.8 percent. Real residential fixed investment increased 12.1 percent, compared with an increase ofÂ 17.6 percent. Real exports of goods and services increased 0.8 percent in the first quarter, in contrast to aÂ decrease of 2.8 percent in the fourth. Real imports of goods and services increased 1.9 percent, inÂ contrast to a decrease of 4.2 percent. Real federal government consumption expenditures and gross investment decreased 8.7 percentÂ in the first quarter, compared with a decrease of 14.8 percent in the fourth. National defense decreasedÂ 12.1 percent, compared with a decrease of 22.1 percent. Nondefense decreased 2.1 percent, in contrastÂ to an increase of 1.7 percent. Real state and local government consumption expenditures and grossÂ investment decreased 2.4 percent, compared with a decrease of 1.5 percent. The change in real private inventories added 0.63 percentage point to the first-quarter change inÂ real GDP, after subtracting 1.52 percentage points from the fourth-quarter change. Private businessesÂ increased inventories $38.3 billion in the first quarter, following an increases of $13.3 billion in theÂ fourth quarter and $60.3 billion in the third. Real final sales of domestic product -- GDP less change in private inventories -- increased 1.8Â percent in the first quarter, compared with an increase of 1.9 percent in the fourth. Gross domestic purchases Real gross domestic purchases -- purchases by U.S. residents of goods and services whereverÂ produced -- increased 2.5 percent in the first quarter; it was unchanged in the fourth quarter. Gross national product Real gross national product -- the goods and services produced by the labor and propertyÂ supplied by U.S. residents -- increased 1.5 percent in the first quarter, compared with an increase of 0.9Â percent in the fourth. GNP includes, and GDP excludes, net receipts of income from the rest of theÂ world, which decreased $30.3 billion in the first quarter after increasing $19.2 billion in the fourth; inÂ the first quarter, receipts decreased $20.8 billion, and payments increased $9.5 billion. Current-dollar GDP Current-dollar GDP -- the market value of the nation's output of goods and services -- increasedÂ 3.6 percent, or $140.4 billion, in the first quarter to a level of $16,004.5 billion. In the fourth quarter,Â current-dollar GDP increased 1.3 percent, or $53.1 billion. Gross domestic income Real gross domestic income (GDI), which measures the output of the economy as the costsÂ incurred and the incomes earned in the production of GDP, increased 2.5 percent in the first quarter,Â compared with an increase of 5.5 percent (revised) in the fourth. For a given quarter, the estimates ofÂ GDP and GDI may differ for a variety of reasons, including the incorporation of largely independentÂ source data. However, over longer time spans, the estimates of GDP and GDI tend to follow similarÂ patterns of change. Revisions The "second" estimate of the third-quarter percent change in GDP is 0.1 percentage point, orÂ $3.9 billion, less than the advance estimate issued last month, primarily reflecting downward revisionsÂ to private inventory investment, to exports, and to state and local government spending that were partlyÂ offset by a downward revision to imports and an upward revision to personal consumption expenditures. Advance Estimate Second Estimate (Percent change from preceding quarter) Real GDP.......................................... 2.5 2.4Current-dollar GDP................................ 3.7 3.6Gross domestic purchases price index.............. 1.1 1.2Â  Corporate Profits Profits from current production (corporate profits with inventory valuation and capitalÂ consumption adjustments) decreased $43.8 billion in the first quarter, in contrast to an increase of $45.4Â billion in the fourth. Current-production cash flow (net cash flow with inventory valuation adjustment) -- the internal funds available to corporations for investment -- increased $110.9 billion in the firstÂ quarter, in contrast to a decrease of $89.8 billion in the fourth. Taxes on corporate income decreased $13.6 billion in the first quarter, compared with a decreaseÂ of $4.4 billion in the fourth. Profits after tax with inventory valuation and capital consumptionÂ adjustments decreased $30.2 billion in the first quarter, in contrast to an increase of $49.8 billion in theÂ fourth. Dividends decreased $101.7 billion in contrast to an increase of $124.3 billion. The large fourth-quarter increase reflected accelerated and special dividends paid by corporations at the end of 2012 inÂ anticipation of changes to individual income tax rates. Current-production undistributed profitsÂ increased $71.4 billion, in contrast to a decrease of $74.3 billion. Domestic profits of financial corporations decreased $2.0 billion in the first quarter, comparedÂ with a decrease of $3.5 billion in the fourth. Domestic profits of nonfinancial corporations decreasedÂ $8.8 billion in the first quarter, in contrast to an increase of $24.8 billion in the fourth. In the firstÂ quarter, real gross value added of nonfinancial corporations increased, and profits per unit of real valueÂ added decreased. The decrease in unit profits reflected an increase in the unit nonlabor costs incurred byÂ corporations that was partly offset by a decrease in unit labor costs; unit prices were unchanged. The rest-of-the-world component of profits decreased $33.0 billion in the first quarter, in contrastÂ to an increase of $24.1 billion in the fourth. This measure is calculated as (1) receipts by U.S. residentsÂ of earnings from their foreign affiliates plus dividends received by U.S. residents from unaffiliatedÂ foreign corporations minus (2) payments by U.S. affiliates of earnings to their foreign parents plusÂ dividends paid by U.S. corporations to unaffiliated foreign residents. The first-quarter decrease wasÂ accounted for by a decrease in receipts and an increase in payments. Profits before tax decreased $49.8 billion in the first quarter, in contrast to an increase of $27.3Â billion in the fourth. The before-tax measure of profits does not reflect, as does profits from currentÂ production, the capital consumption and inventory valuation adjustments. These adjustments convertÂ depreciation of fixed assets and inventory withdrawals reported on a tax-return, historical-cost basis toÂ the current-cost measures used in the national income and product accounts. The capital consumptionÂ adjustment increased $12.9 billion in the first quarter (from -$199.5 billion to -$186.6 billion), comparedÂ with an increase of $0.5 billion in the fourth. The inventory valuation adjustment decreased $6.9 billionÂ (from -$9.2 billion to -$16.1 billion), in contrast to an increase of $17.6 billion. The first-quarter changes in taxes on corporate income and in the capital consumptionÂ adjustment mainly reflect the expiration of bonus depreciation claimed under the American TaxpayerÂ Relief Act of 2012. For detailed data, see the table "Net Effects of the Tax Acts of 2002, 2003, 2008,Â 2009, 2010, and 2012 on Selected Measures of Corporate Profits" atÂ www.bea.gov/national/xls/technote_tax_acts.xls. Profits from current production are not affectedÂ because they do not depend on the depreciation-accounting practices used for federal income tax returns;Â rather, they are based on depreciation of fixed assets valued at current cost using consistent depreciationÂ profiles based on used-asset prices.

GettyFormer CIA Director and retired U.S. Army General David Petraeus has joined private equity giant KKR, the firm said in a release.Â  Petraeus, who resigned from the top post at the CIA over an extramarital affair last year, is now the chairman of the newly created KKR Global Institute.Â  Here's the release:Â  Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. L.P. today announced the appointment of retired four-star General and former Director of the CIA David PetraeusÂ as Chairman of the newly createdÂ KKR Global Institute. Henry Kravis, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of KKR, stated: "I have long known and respectedÂ General PetraeusÂ and, on behalf of everyone at KKR, I welcome him to the firm. As the world changes and we expand how and where we invest, we are always looking to sharpen the â€˜KKR edge.' With the addition ofÂ General Petraeus, we are building on the work we have done to understand the investment implications of public policy, macro-economic, regulatory and technology trends globally. We are pleased to bring all of this expertise together under one umbrella, theÂ KKR Global Institute, to deliver the best of KKR's insights for our investors." Over the past several years, macro-economic and geopolitical considerations, including the heightened role of central banks following the financial crisis, new regulation and major changes in public policy, have led to KKR's increased engagement on these areas and on environmental, social and governance issues. At the same time, KKR is a global firm investing in new and emerging markets that have new risks and opportunities.Â The KKR Global InstituteÂ will be the nexus of KKR's focus on the investment implications of these issues. It will also further build on the firm's efforts to help KKR's portfolio companies expand globally, and it will periodically serve as an outlet for publishing the firm's thought leadership products, including views from portfolio managers and industry experts. As Chairman of theÂ KKR Global Institute,Â General PetraeusÂ will work withÂ aÂ team at KKR and in tandem withÂ Ken Mehlman, Global Head of Public Affairs,Â andHenry McVey, Global Head of Macro &amp; Asset Allocation. In addition to his role as Chairman of theÂ KKR Global Institute,Â General PetraeusÂ will also support KKR's investment teams in the diligence process, especially when the Firm is considering investments in new geographies. "KKR is one of the best investment firms in the world,"Â General Petraeus observed. "I am very pleased to join such a great team. I have watched KKR evolve as it adapted to the post-financial crisis world and became a go-to partner for companies worldwide. I look forward to supporting the investment teams in their pursuit of the best opportunities for clients and also being a part of a new initiative to provide additional insights to KKR's clients and companies." Ken Mehlman, a key partner in establishing the Institute, said: "For 37 years, KKR has produced strong returns for our investors by marrying deep industry knowledge with active ownership and a long-term focus. Over the last five years, KKR has established and systematized our focus on stakeholder engagement and macro-economic and geopolitical factors. These considerations are now built into our investment and portfolio management processes and with this new initiative and additional talent, we will take it to the next level." In recent months,Â General PetraeusÂ has focused his efforts on supporting returning veterans as they transition to the workforce. Among such endeavors, he currently serves on the advisory council ofÂ American Corporate Partners, an organization that connects veterans to business leaders. In addition, he will lead a seminar as a visiting professor at theÂ City UniversityÂ of New York'sÂ Macaulay Honors CollegeÂ and he is a member of theÂ University of Southern California faculty. As a Judge Wid ney Professor at theÂ University of Southern California, he will lecture part time and also mentor members of the school'sÂ Reserve Officers Training CorpsÂ program and young veterans. General PetraeusÂ holds a PhD in international relations fromÂ Princeton UniversityÂ and has taught economics and international relations at theÂ United States Military Academy at West Point. He also completed a fellowship at Georgetown University'sÂ Institute for the Study of Diplomacy. About GeneralÂ David H. Petraeus David Howell PetraeusÂ is a retired American military officer and former government official. InÂ June 2011, theÂ U.S. SenateÂ unanimously confirmed him as director of theÂ CIA, a role he held fromÂ September 2011Â untilÂ November 2012. Prior to assuming the directorship of theÂ CIA, he was a highly decorated four-star general, serving more than 37 years in theÂ U.S. ArmyÂ before retiring inÂ August 2011. A lauded combat leader and strategist,Â General PetraeusÂ was instrumental in reshaping American military doctrine through his focus on the concepts of a comprehensive civil-military counterinsurgency campaign. General Petraeus' final assignment in the military was as commander of the NATO International Security Assistance Force and U.S. forces inÂ Afghanistan. Other four-star assignments included his service as the 10th commander of the U.S. Central Command, where he was responsible for military operations in Afghanistan,Â Pakistan,Â Central Asia, theÂ Arabian Peninsula,Â Iraq, the Levant and Egypt, and his service as commanding general of the Multi-National Forceâ€”Iraq for more than 19 months. In the latter position, he commanded all coalition forces inÂ IraqÂ throughout the surge in 2007 and 2008 when violence in that country was reduced by nearly 90 percent. During that tour inÂ Iraq, he oversaw the implementation of the concepts in theÂ Army/Marine CorpsÂ counterinsurgency manual that was drafted under his direction during his assignment as commander of theÂ U.S. Army Combined Arms Center atÂ Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, between his second and third tours inÂ Iraq. Previously,Â General PetraeusÂ was the first commander of the Multi-National Security Transition Command-Iraq and the NATO Training Missionâ€”Iraq. Prior to those assignments, he was commanding general of the U.S. Army'sÂ 101st Airborne DivisionÂ (Air Assault), leading the 101st intoÂ IraqÂ in 2003 during the fight toÂ BaghdadÂ and the first year inÂ Iraq, when his division distinguished itself in the conduct of a comprehensive counterinsurgency campaign. Following General Petraeus' extensive service in theÂ Middle East, former U.S. Secretary of DefenseÂ Robert GatesÂ praised him for the critical and historic role he played in dramatically reducing the violence inÂ IraqÂ and haling the Taliban's momentum inÂ Afghanistan, writing that he had "changed the course of two wars, an unprecedented accomplishment." Earlier in General Petraeus' career, he also served inÂ Europe,Â Bosnia,Â Central America,Â Haiti,Â KuwaitÂ andÂ the United States. General PetraeusÂ earned a bachelor's degree from theÂ United States Military Academy, from which he graduated in 1974 as a distinguished cadet, finishing in the top 5 percent of his class. He later received the GeneralÂ George C. Marshall Award as the top graduate of theÂ U.S. ArmyÂ CommandÂ and General Staff CollegeÂ class of 1983. He subsequently earned an MPA and a PhD in international relations from theÂ Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International AffairsÂ atÂ Princeton University. He served as assistant professor of international relations at theÂ U.S. Military AcademyÂ and also completed a fellowship at Georgetown University'sÂ Institute for the Study of Diplomacy.
Wikimedia CommonsDave Lutz of Stifel, Nicolaus passes along the top topics about which he's chattering with clients this morning. It's been a busy morning. The topics largely revolve around Japan: Futures just leapt higher on headlines that Japan's public pension fund - a pool of over $1 trillion â€“ is shifting itâ€™s investments towards Equities. Â E-minis have recovered into the green, and EU markets, which were quite resilient overnight, are popping â€“ led by a 70bp move in the DAX. Â Most eyes overnight were in the Nikkei, which had lost 5% as the strengthening Yen slammed exporters â€“ and profit taking accelerated in the worldâ€™s best performing equity market. Â  Nikkei futures have recovered almost 3% of those losses once that headline hit. Â  Other Asian markets shrugged off the Nikkei whack, with China off small ahead of Manufacturing data â€“ and Aussie off 80bp as Iron Ore prices hit a 7M low, and Mining cap-ex is slashed in forecasts. High attention on JGBâ€™s overnight â€“ Yields were off small as the BOJ announced a ramp and shift of purchases to dampen volatility â€“ and the MoF outlined incentives to get more retail buying of JGBâ€™s. Â US 10YY is slightly higher, but just off yesterdayâ€™s lows â€“ We continue to see it sparking the rotation within equities: Â Selling Utilities, REITS and Staples (Divvy Plays), and buying Tech and Finsâ€¦ Â  The DXY is weaker, despite the Yen getting hit right now â€“ providing a natural tailwind for commodities. Â Gold is back over $1400/oz, and Lumber is showing the dead-cat bounce formation after being limit down again yesterday. Â The energy complex is under pressure, as API data last night showed inventories at 30Y highs, ahead of DOE today at 11. Â  Opecâ€™s 12 oil ministers are expected to stick to the organization's present output target of 30 million barrels a day at their Friday meeting.

And the price per watt crashed, from $76 in 1977 to about $7 in 1989. Then it leveled off. By 2000 it began to drop again, hit $4 in 2005, $2 in 2010, and a forecast $0.74 per watt in 2013 (graph). But it wreaked havoc. Business models collapsed. Funding dried up. PV companies bled red ink. In the US, a slew of them, including Solyndra, went bankrupt. Others shut down or changed course. Tens of billions in taxpayer subsidies and investor capital spiraled down the drain. In Germany, solar power was a political priority. They donâ€™t have much sun, but they have more sun than oil, the logic went. Now even Bosch Solar Energy AG is fleeing the business after burning through $3.1 billion. Same story in France, in Spain. Bloodletting everywhere. They all blamed the low prices of Chinese solar panels. Complaints that led to anti-dumping proceedings in the US and aggravated the trade war between the EU and China [my take on this debacle: Â Germany Fires Salvo In Sino-European Trade War ... AtÂ Brussels]. But solar power generators, from utilities with large-scale installations to farmers with solar panels on their barns, were ecstatic. They enjoyed subsidies, nearly free financing, and the hope that the system would more than pay for itself over the course of its 25-year life span. It would be a good deal. But it might not be. The price war that Chinese manufacturers waged was a suicide mission. Now even theyâ€™re going bankrupt, including their erstwhile number one, Wuxi Suntech, when the banks pulled the ripcord in March. Existentially threatened, they cut costs ... and corners. Defective solar panels can be costly. The New York Times described what happened to the PV installation on a warehouse roof in Southern California whose promise of a 25-year life span disintegrated along with the protective coatings on the panels after only two years, and part of it went up in smoke when defects caused two fires. â€œWorldwide, testing labs, developers, financiers, and insurers are reporting similar problems and say the $77 billion solar industry is facing a quality crisis,â€ the Times reported. But instead of tracking defects industry-wide, manufacturers hide behind confidentiality agreements that treat their name as a secret. So no one knows the extent of the crisis. And itâ€™s just the beginning: since nearly half of the 7.2 gigawatts of capacity in the US were installed in 2012 in a burst of incentive-fueled activity, most of the problems have not yet come to light. But some have: Executives at companies that inspect Chinese factories on behalf of developers and financiers said that over the last 18 months they have found that even the most reputable companies are substituting cheaper, untested materials. Other brand-name manufacturers, they said, have shut down production lines and subcontracted the assembly of modules to smaller makers. STS Certified, a French testing service, evaluated 215,000 PV modules at its Shanghai laboratory and found that defects had jumped from 7.8% in 2011 to 13% in 2012. An entire batch from one manufacturer was defective, but STS refused to identify the culprit â€“ a company listed on the New York Stock Exchange â€“ due to the confidentiality agreements. German solar monitoring firm Meteocontrol found that 80% of the installations in Europe it had examined were underperforming. SolarBuyer, based in Massachusetts, audited 50 Chinese plants over 18 months; defect rates ranged from 5.5% to a dizzying 22%. During repeat audits, it found that plants were constantly substituting cheaper materials. Ian Gregory, SolarBuyerâ€™s senior marketing director, warned: â€œIf the materials arenâ€™t good or havenâ€™t been thoroughly tested, they wonâ€™t stick together, and the solar module will eventually fall apart in the field.â€ Even Chinese insiders admit it: â€œThere are a lot of shortcuts being taken, and unfortunately itâ€™s by some of the more reputable companies, and thereâ€™s also been lot of new companies starting up in recent years without the same standards weâ€™ve had at Suntech,â€ lamented Chief Technology Officer Stuart Wenham â€“ the same Suntech that was pushed into bankruptcy in March. There are still some lucky solar developers and installers who claim that they havenâ€™t run into quality problems yet on systems installed in 2012. But theyâ€™re brand-new, with 24 more years to go. And some of the defective panels werenâ€™t made in China; all manufacturers are under pressure to cut corners in order to survive. First Solar, a US company, has reserved $271 million to account for the expense of replacing defective modules sold in 2008 and 2009. No word yet of those sold during the binge of 2012. The costs of these defects will eat further into the industry that is struggling to become financially viable. Yet, in a cruel twist, the price of solar panels must continue to drop for solar power to be competitive without subsidies. Taxpayers, stung by austerity in Europe and by the sequester in the US, are already less than enthusiastic about propping up the industry forever. At some point, it must be able to stand on its own, at still lower prices that magically allow manufacturers, and not only power generators, to thrive â€“ an illusion, for now. But waves of â€œcheapâ€ solar panels that suddenly become very expensive after theyâ€™re installed will cause more bloodletting and push the propitious date further into the future. China pops up everywhere. Aircraft maintenance was once a highly paid blue-collar job that required education, training, and manual skills. A perfect American middle-class job with healthcare, retirement, and vacation benefits; and free flights! Working for icons like Delta, American Airlines, Continental, TWA, or Pan Am! Icons indeed.

The craziness in the Japanese market continues. Today has been another wild day. In Thursday trading, the Nikkei collapsed another 5%. You might quibble with the terminology, but basically Japan has been crashing, as it fell 7% last Thursday, and has been very weak since then. Of course, this comes following an incredible surged that started last autumn, as Japan has embarked on a shock treatment course of monetary stimulus known as "Abenomics" which has enjuiced the stock market and caused the yen to dive. So things had been plunging today, and then in the last hour, Japan has gone vertical, with futures surging about 400 points. The culprit? A Reuters report about Japan's big pension fund being able to move into equities. Previously it had just been in JGBs (Japanese Government Bonds) For such a huge market, this kind of volatility is stunning. FinViz Meanwhile, this turnaround has lifted markets around the world, although for the most part, other equity markets haven't been too moved by the ructions in Japan.

The "seasonal" manufacturing activity slowdown in the US (discussed here) has arrived on schedule. It is visible not just in the Markit PMI measure, but across other national and regional indicators as well. Here are some recent news quotes on the subject: But no worries. Why bother with manufacturing when US personal consumption remains firmly above 70% of the GDP. SoberLook The conventional wisdom goes that if the consumer is happy and in a spending mood, the US economy should grow. And given the ongoing rally in housing and stocks, American consumers seem quite happy indeed. Consumer sentiment hit a post-recession high this month (chart below). Now we just have to see if this happiness translates into sales. Econoday Given these improvements in consumer sentiment, nobody seems to care much about the silly manufacturing slowdown. The consensus seems to be that the US consumer will come to the rescue once again.
C-SPANTim Duy thinks the Fed might start to taper asset purchases in September: September Looking Good A "few more months" I interpret as June, July, and August, which puts the beginning of tapering at the September FOMC meeting. I think that Fed speakers are sending pretty clear signals to prepare for a September policy change. Some big names on Wall Street don't agree. Vincent Reinhart at Morgan Stanley believes the data will push the Fed back to December. The view at Goldman Sachs is reportedly similar. To be sure, the data might cut in that direction, but I think that the bar to tapering might be lower than believed by those looking for a shift in December. We may believe the Federal Reserve's dual mandate argues for a longer period of QE at its current pace, but I am thinking that for the Federal Reserve, the dual mandate has more to do with the lift-off date from ZIRP than the end of QE. They have tended to argue for more or less QE on the basis of "stronger and sustainable" improvement in labor markets, and, given the obvious shift in tone among Fed speakers, I think we have reached that benchmark. At this point, they are just looking for a little more confirmation, in their minds erring on the side of being "too easy." A lot of data will be coming in the door over the next week and a half, culminating in the all-important employment report on Friday, June 5. I think even a moderately positive run of data will further cement a September shift. Most analysts expect some economic slowdown in Q2 and Q3 due to the significant fiscal drag over the next couple of quarters. I expect the Fed will wait and see how much fiscal policy impacts growth and employment, so - unless the data s very strong - I think the Fed will wait until at least September before they start tapering. Of course "tapering" is still very accommodative. Thursday economic releases: • At 7:00 AM ET, the BEA will release the second estimate of Q1 GDP. The consensus is that real GDP increased 2.5% annualized in Q1, unchanged from the advance report. • Also at 8:30 AM, the initial weekly unemployment claims report will be released. The consensus is for claims at 340 thousand, unchanged from last week. • At 10:00 AM, the NAR will release Pending Home Sales Index for April. The consensus is for a 1.4% increase in the index
Something's up. Everyone can tell. But nobody is quite sure what it is. Around the world, markets aren't behaving quite like they were just a week or so ago. Notably: So what's going on? Well, a big part of this is explained by Krugman, who argues that basically we're seeing a shift towards a much more optimistic outlook, that rising US equities, a rising dollar, and rising rates are all perfectly consistent with a market that sees a real recovery taking hold In a more deep and complicated look, the pseudonymous analyst Barnejek has a fabulous post on his blog trying to come up with sort of a grand-unified theory of everything that's been going on The post is titled What I Make Of It All, and he writes: Now, it may well be the case that we’re simply experiencing a risk-off period, although I’m not sure equity and commodities markets would agree with that fully. Neither is the UST sell-off the first thing that springs to mind when discussing the dreaded risk-off. A theory, which is a bit closer to my heart is what Paul Krugman put in his blog today but again the USD is not really rallying. Alternatively, stuff like the Mexican peso shouldn’t be under so much pressure in such a scenario, I reckon. I see two main forces driving the market at the moment. The first one is the Bank of Japan. In my post Eddie Vedder and the Japanese carry from April 13 (USD/JPY approaching 100 ) I was being skeptical about the whole concept of yen being used to fund stuff elsewhere saying that the Japanese will probably find plenty of opportunities locally if they believe in Abenomics. However, I did also say that if anything they’d go for bonds in the US, which are looking considerably better than other global bonds on a currency-hedged basis. Similarly, if a Japanese investor wants to bet on the yen decline, then they should keep it simple and do USD/JPY rather than, say, AUD/JPY. And this is a very important point because whenever USDJPY jumps 1%, it pushes the USD index higher by almost 0.15%, thus creating the impression that the risk is off because the USD strengthens. Therefore, the previous correlation of “yen lower, risk higher” does not work like a charm anymore. The whole thing is really required reading. Meanwhile, in an email blast to clients, SocGen's Kit Juckes also takes a stab at a bigger picture view: The Nikkei has wiped out May's gains. Unless USD/JPY collapses a couple more percentage points, we're still in for an unprecedented 8th consecutive month/month gain, but yesterday's price action in yen and Swiss franc was ugly (for a bear of both). And the Japanese sales of foreign bonds are persistent enough to force head-scratching now...  My core view  - that re-calibration of  Treasury yields leads to dollar strength, EM and commodity weakness, and a much bumpier June/August period for risk assets - isn't altered. But it's clear that bumpiness will be felt everywhere. Since 10yr note yields fell yesterday long before the Nikkei opened, I can't help suspecting they'll get more help this morning. An upward revision to GDP won't be enough to swing us the other way. It's a bearish market but not a smooth one. Nothing is quite satisfying. There are a lot of stories playing out, and perhaps there's no good explanation of it all, but it's certainly fascinating to watch the ground moving.
Japan is now down 13% from its recent highs just made last week. One might quibble over technical definitions, but after last night's 5% plunge, the Nikkei has crashed. And yet. Despite Japan being one of the biggest stories in the world and one of the biggest markets in the world, other markets just don't care. The US had a rough day yesterday, but it's basically at all-time highs still. Today Europe is doing fine. In fact, Italy is having a quite solid day, as it's currently up 0.5%. FTSE MIB The markets have gotten a hair wobblier in recent days (and the last couple of weeks) but it's amazing the extent to which Japan continues to be something of a vacuum-case.
Paul Krugman has a post out today with a simple guideline for understanding the current environment where interest rates are rising, stocks are climbing and the dollar is climbing.   He says: “I’ve been getting some questions about the recent rise in long-term interest rates. Those rates are still at levels that would have seemed absurdly low not long ago — but they are up significantly from a few months ago. What should we make of this move? … So when long-term interest rates rise, there are three main stories you hear. One is that the bond vigilantes have arrived, and are selling US debt because they now believe in the horror stories. Another is that the Fed has changed, that it may be ready to snatch away the punch bowl sooner than previously believed. And the third is that the economy is looking stronger than expected, which means that the Fed, although just as soft-hearted as before, will nonetheless start raising rates sooner than previously believed. All three of these stories would imply falling bond prices, that is, rising interest rates. But they have different implications for other markets, in particular for stocks and the dollar. Debt fears — basically, a run on America — should send stocks and the dollar down along with bonds. A perceived tougher Fed should send stocks down but the dollar up. And a better recovery should send both stocks up (because of higher expected profits) and drive the dollar higher.” He then shows this table which ties the story together neatly: Paul Krugman There’s just one huge problem with that.  Stocks don’t tend to fall when the Fed gets tougher and the dollar also doesn’t tend to rise.  Since 1954 there have been 11 major Fed tightening cycles (trough to peak Fed Funds Rate).  During those cycles the S&amp;P 500 rallied 11% on average while the broad dollar basket lost 0.5%.   So the story isn’t as cut and dry as Dr. Krugman makes it seem.  And sometimes that’s the story from the markets – there just isn’t a rational explanation for particular moves.  In my opinion, the recent moves in the bond market appear to be some mixture of economic optimism and utter confusion over QE and the future of Fed policy.  But there’s no hard and fast rule that can be applied to particular asset price moves and attempts to apply reasoning to often unpredictable and irrational market moves is futile. PS – Dr. Krugman is dead right about the bond vigilantes.  They’re not coming to attack us.  If anything, they’re going to scavenge off the communications from the Fed. PPS – I am not saying that stocks CAN’T fall if the Fed tightens.  I am simply saying that the idea that “Fed tightening = lower stocks” is not backed by strong historical evidence.
This is really getting real. Japan has been destroyed again. The Nikkei fell 5% last night, relative to Wednesday's close. This follows last Thursday's big 7% crash, and several weak days in the meantime. Remember, Japan had been on an extraordinary run starting last fall, thanks to "Abenomics", the new aggressive stimulus campaign of the new Prime Minister. But lately things have just been a disaster market wise. Among the concerns, a sharp rise in bond yields, that some fear could undermine the whole thing. As you can see on this Nikkei futures chart, the market is only back to where it was at the end of April, which still means it's had an incredible run. Still that is a startling dropoff. FinViz
