Little doubt remains at this stage that the Fed will begin slowing its securities purchases this September. The central bank under Bernanke's leadership has been highly focused on data and will consider the following 5 broad indicators to reach its decision. 1. Labor markets:¬†As Bernanke recently pointed out, with respect to labor markets the hurdle for reducing purchases is lower than for raising rates. The FOMC will be looking for improvements in demand for labor in the US and will find it in these data: ¬† While the labor situation is still terrible by historical standards, it will be sufficient for the FOMC who will be looking for steady improvements. The strength in consumer confidence (see¬†latest from U Michigan) will also be viewed as supportive of the stronger labor markets thesis.2. Money supply:¬†Once again the view will be that broad money supply's relatively steady growth of above 7% per year will suffice. 3. Economic activity:¬†While a number of indicators have been pointing to less than stellar growth, the Fed will consider (among other measures) the broadest indicator, the so-called Coincidence Index of Economic Activity. The index hides numerous problems with the economy but will nevertheless be an important data point for the central bank. And based on this indicator, the US is experiencing sufficiently steady growth. To support the steady growth thesis, the Fed will also consider surprisingly strong auto purchases and factory orders data (see Reuters story). 4. Financial stress: ¬†The Fed's own indicators point to fairly benign financial conditions. This is not surprising given the relatively tight swap spreads and credit spreads, low VIX, strong equity markets, etc. Supporting the US data on financial stress is the ECB's "Systemic Stress Composite Indicator" (below), which has declined to near record lows. Given the impact of the Eurozone crisis on US financial markets, the Fed will clearly consider that index as well. 5. Impact on interest rates:¬†Certainly with the Fed exiting treasury purchases, the demand for US government paper should will be reduced, pushing yields higher. But given the recent fiscal tightening in the US (due in large part to the sequester), treasury issuance is expected to decline - at least in the near term (chart below). The Fed will view this decline in the federal government's borrowing needs as counteracting its reduction in purchases and keeping rates under control in the near term. Obviously, an¬†exogenous shock such as a spike in oil prices could force the Fed to hold off. Also the US legislators' failure to raise the federal debt ceiling, which Bernanke called "a calamitous outcome", could take tapering off the table. Aside from such events, the Fed is likely to shave off some $15-$20bn from its monthly purchases. With Bernanke likely departing early next year, the Fed is eager to wrap up this latest round of purchases soon and focus on the more traditional policy tools such as short-term rates and forward guidance (see discussion).
Japan has come under a renewed bout of market weakness lately, and that's the story to start the week. Currently the Nikkei is off just under 2%, as the yen strengthens again. The index got roughed up on both Thursday and Friday. Nikkei.com
Stephen DreherThe Nikkei opened down -1.63 Monday morning and continues to fall. Australia's ASX 200 is off -0.10% after opening up slightly higher. Seoul's Kospi index is off -0.56%. As our Sam Ro reported, the amount of economic data coming out this week is incredibly dense: U.S. non-farm payrolls, U.S. housing data, U.S. GDP revisions ‚Äî not to mention three central bank meetings.
Thereís no denying Chinaís massive economic growth over the past decade, as the country recorded an average GDP of more than 10 percent per year. In only seven years, Chinaís economy doubled; in 13 years, it tripled. With this incredible expansion, China began to import commodities at an incredible pace. In 2000, the country imported only 70 million tons of iron ore; today, itís more than 10 times that amount, at 763 million tons. Copper imports increased dramatically too, growing from 1.6 million tons in 2000 to more than 4 million tons per year today, according to BCA Research data. And when it comes to oil demand, 17 years ago, China was a net exporter. Today, it is the second-largest importer, transporting 5.4 million barrels of oil into the country every day. Thatís why it is widely accepted that the Asian giant spurred higher commodity prices in the past decade. And if the country was the force behind the boom, then the assumption is that Chinaís lower, but still healthy growth will be a drag on commodity prices. But recent research challenges this assumption.  According to BCA Researchís Chen Zhao, what is initially an ìoutrageous propositionî may not actually be. The analyst says the fact that Chinaís consumption of industrial commodities significantly increased at the same time prices rose may have only created ìthe impression that China was the main driving force behind the commodities boom. " Consider that since the substantial growth early in the last decade, China has continued to import commodities at a remarkable pace. Since 2007, the Asian giant buys 2 times more iron ore, 1.5 times more copper and 6 times more coal from other countries.  ìThe level of Chinese commodity imports obviously reflects the size of its economy,î says BCA. So even if the growth rate has slowed down, ìthe absolute level of Chinese commodity demand continues to set new records every year.î Then whatís really driving commodity prices? If you canít entirely blame weak commodity prices on Chinese demand, what is the culprit? Take a look at the chart below. The red line plots the 10-year rolling correlation of annual returns on the Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Commodity Index (CRB) with Chinaís real GDP growth. The correlation between these two numbers has stayed close to 0.4 since the late 1990s. Now take a look at the blue line, which shows a negative correlation between the CRB and the trade-weighted U.S. Dollar. The correlation since 2010 has hovered around -0.8, implying that ìthe dollar has much more explanatory power,î says BCA.  The data confirms BCAís ìlong-term suspicion that the bull market in commodities last decade was mainly a reflection of a sustained fall in the U.S. dollar.î This isnít the only time weíve experienced this phenomenon. In the 1990s, when the U.S. economy was booming and the dollar was strong, commodity prices were weak and oil prices fell to an all-time low of $10 per barrel. Today, many emerging market economies that had no global footprint a few decades ago are now growing at a much faster pace than the developed countries. These emerging nations have young, growing populations who are moving to the cities, becoming wealthier, and consuming more goods and services. However, like I shared recently, Credit Suisse is of the opinion that prices of commodities may no longer rise and fall together in unison, emphasizing that investors will need to focus on individual commodities depending on the supply and demand factors. This is why we advocate that investors hold a diversified basket of commodities actively managed by professionals who understand these specialized assets and the global trends affecting them.

First of all, it's jobs week in America. The July U.S. jobs report comes out on Friday, and the numbers will be considered carefully as the Federal Reserve decides the course of its currently ultra-easy monetary policy. Furthermore, new U.S. housing data may begin to give us a sense of whether rising mortgage rates are affecting homebuyer behavior. Similar insights will be revealed through the July auto sales figures. Speaking of monetary policy, three of the world's most important central banks will hold interest rate meetings this week. All of this comes as every major economy around the world will publish its crucial manufacturing PMI reports. Is Europe still getting better? Is China still getting worse? Meanwhile, we're still in the middle of Q2 earnings season. Pfizer, ExxonMobil, Proctor &amp; Gamble, and Berkshire Hathaway are just a few of the companies announcing this week. Also, the U.S. will be publishing revisions to every GDP report since 1929. Top Stories Economic Calendar Market Commentary Despite the sea of uncertainty on the horizon, J.P. Morgan's Tom Lee is bullish. "With both U.S. and Europe expected to see better growth in [the second half of 2013], we believe the Street will be in a position to raise 2014E EPS," said Lee about stock market profits. "We are raising 2014E EPS to $120 (vs $117) and also raising our YE 2013E S&amp;P 500 Target to 1775 (up 3.5% vs prior 1715)." Among other things, Lee is encouraged by the pent-up demand he sees in the U.S. "As for the U.S. and to a lesser extent for Europe, this is more than ‚Äúeasing financial conditions‚Äù but a story of pent-up demand," he said. "[I]nvestment/durables spending in the U.S. remains at 60-year lows. And at a time when the age of capital- stock is near record highs. This is a formula, in our view, for obsolescence asserting itself in the form of an eventual sharp rise in spending."

REUTERS/Lucas Landau A girl stands in front of riot police while they block the road to Maracana stadium during a protest in Rio de Janeiro June 30, 2013. Tens of thousands of Brazilians have taken to the streets this month in the biggest protests in 20 years, fuelled by an array of grievances ranging from poor public services to the high cost of World Cup soccer stadiums and corruption.Last month during¬†the 2013 Confederations Cup¬†in Brazil¬†‚Äî a test run ahead of next summer's World Cup ‚Äî more than a million of Brazilians took to the streets to protest crime, corruption, failing public schools and hospitals, and high and rising prices. High prices may be the most critical factor in Brazilian unrest, according to¬†Simon Romero of The New York Times. Romero offers several striking examples: And it's been going on for years. In September 2011 we provided some examples:¬†¬† Romero writes that the stunningly high pricing can be largely attributed to "a dysfunctional tax system that prioritizes consumption taxes, which are relatively easy to collect, over income taxes." Even as Brazil benefits from¬†a decade of steady economic growth¬†fueled by¬†booming commodity exports and a consumer binge that lifted 35 million Brazilians from poverty,¬†the new middle classes ‚Äî not to mention the poor ‚Äî are being squeezed by the high cost of basic goods and services. ‚ÄúBrazil is on the verge of recession now that the commodities boom is over,‚Äù Luciano Sobral, an economist and a partner in a S√£o Paulo¬†told The Times. ‚ÄúThis is making it impossible to ignore the high prices which plague Brazilians, especially those who cannot easily afford to travel abroad for buying sprees where things are cheaper.‚Äù If that is true, the public protests will be even bigger during the 2014 World Cup across the country and the 2016 Olympics in Rio.
WASHINGTON (AP) ‚Äî Congress needs to raise the debt limit and take away the "cloud of uncertainty" about the nation's ability to pay its bills, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said in an interview broadcast Sunday. "The fight over the debt limit in 2011 hurt the economy, even though, in the end, we saw an extension of the debt limit. We saw confidence fall, and it hurt the economy," Lew said on NBC's "Meet The Press." :Congress needs to do its job. It needs to finish its work on appropriation bills. It needs to pass a debt limit." Senior lawmakers on Capitol Hill are trying to come up with must-do legislation to keep federal agencies running after Sept. 30 and prevent the possibility of a government shutdown. At issue is what is normally routine: a plug-the-gap measure to fund the government for a few weeks or months until a deal can be worked out on appropriations bills giving agencies their operating budgets for the full 2014 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1. However, some Democrats don't want to vote to continue to fund the government at new, lower levels mandated by the automatic, across-the-board spending cuts known as sequestration. And some conservatives are making a last stand against President Barack Obama's new health care law. In addition, Senate Democrats are resistant to a $20 billion spending cut sought by many Republicans. The issue has divided Republicans between those who think it's appropriate to use the threat of a government shutdown as a negotiating tactic, and those who don't. Rep. Peter King, R.-N.Y., said Republicans should be searching for ways to de-fund or repeal the Obama health care act. But he called threatening to shut down the government "terror politics" and said the strategy wouldn't work. Others have worried that the gamesmanship could cause Republicans to lose control of the House. Some observers say it's an idea doomed to fail anyway, since Obama brings both a veto pen and the White House podium to the battle. "We should not be closing down the government under any circumstances," King said Sunday on CNN's "State of the Union." Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, has taken just that tack, rounding up fellow conservatives to pledge to oppose any budget extension that funds implementation of the health care law. Sunday, he said it was unfair to implement a law that many Americans don't want and that still has wrinkles that need to be ironed out. "I understand that there's some in the Washington establishment, some from both political parties, that weren't happy with me over this," Lee said on "Fox News Sunday." ''And in this instance, I'm going to take that as a compliment, an indication that I'm doing something right." "The fact is that we can delay this bill," he added. "And if we can delay it, we can stop its consequences, at least for now." Lew maintains that the president won't negotiate over the debt limit. "The mere fact of negotiating over the debt limit, after 2011, would introduce this notion that somehow there's a question about whether or not we're going to pay our bills, whether or not we're going to protect the full faith and credit of the United States," Lew said on ABC's "This Week with George Stephanopoulos." ''Well, it's not OK to default. Congress can't let us default." "(Congress) has to stop looking for what's the last possible moment," Lew told "Fox News Sunday." ''They should get back after they take their time off in August and they should finish their work and get it done so that there's no uncertainty about America's ability to pay its bills." Separately, Lew said no federal bailout is in the works for the city of Detroit, which recently filed for bankruptcy protection. Pressed as to why the government chose to bail out big banks, the auto industry and others, but isn't assisting the city, Lew said on CNN's "State of the Union" that the government has been giving Detroit technical advice and has made resources available to help take down blighted properties through federal programs. But Lew said that the situation during the financial crisis that warranted the other bailouts was "unique," and that the current problems that Detroit has with its creditors, "it's going to have to work out with its creditors."
REUTERS/Larry DowningPresident of Shell Oil Company John Hofmeister (C) is joined by Chairman and President of BP America Inc. Robert Malone (L), and Vice Chairman of the Board of Chevron Corporation Peter Robertson as he testifies about the rising cost of gas prices before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill, May 21, 2008.PITTSBURGH (AP) ‚Äî The boom in oil and gas fracking has led to jobs, billions in royalties and profits, and even some environmental gains. But some experts say arrogance, a lack of transparency and poor communication on the part of the drilling industry have helped fuel public anger over the process of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. "It's a big issue for the industry. I have called for greater transparency. That is the only way to have an honest conversation with the public," said John Hofmeister, a former Shell Oil Co. president and author of "Why We Hate Oil Companies." As an example, Hofmeister said, some industry leaders have suggested that the fracking boom has never caused water pollution. But while the vast majority of wells don't cause problems, "everybody knows that some wells go bad," Hofmeister said. Over the last five years, advances in technology have led to a surge of drilling in states such as Pennsylvania, Colorado, Arkansas and North Dakota. Previously inaccessible deposits of shale oil and gas have been unlocked by fracking, a process in which large amounts of water and sand along with chemicals are injected deep underground to break apart the rock. One of the biggest promoters of the Marcellus Shale drilling boom in Pennsylvania says that while fracking opponents have exaggerated some risks, the industry hasn't always handled key issues well, either. Terry Engelder, a Penn State geologist, cited the highly publicized case in Dimock, Pa., where 18 families began complaining in 2009 that nearby drilling had polluted their water supply with methane gas and toxic chemicals. State environmental regulators ultimately agreed, imposing large fines on Houston-based Cabot Oil &amp; Gas Co, and temporarily banning the company from drilling in a 9-square-mile area around the town. Cabot paid the fines but denied responsibility for the contamination. Engelder said at least some of the industry's missteps have been unintentional and come from inexperience. In Dimock, the land had so many layers of rock and the drilling boom was so new that both the industry and regulators struggled to understand and explain the problems with the water wells, Engelder said. Cabot spokesman George Stark said that in retrospect, the company realized that the geology around Dimock was "highly unusual" and that pre-drilling tests for methane would have helped determine which wells had natural contamination of methane. In 2010, Cabot began holding summer picnics in the Dimock area to answer questions about the industry, drilling and local geology, Stark said. More than 8,000 people attended last week's event, up from about 2,000 the first year, he said. While many issues were at play, Engelder said, experts came to believe that the well construction techniques used in the early years of Pennsylvania's drilling boom "were just inadequate to the task" of protecting groundwater in that area. Regulations for well cement jobs were later strengthened considerably, but by that time, anger and negative publicity had started building, and the damage was done. Engelder and Hofmeister say that to the industry's credit, the drilling boom has brought many benefits. Many communities haven't had major problems and welcome the jobs and the royalty payments that can reach hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars for a single landowner. But Engelder said the industry can't just focus on positives. "There never will be a risk-free gas industry in Pennsylvania, just like there never will be risk-free driving a car," he said. Engelder said he believes the industry should work more closely with opponents and give them detailed explanations of the geology, the risks and the benefits of drilling. "I would do whatever it took to try and engage these people over a period of time," he said. But some industry critics are skeptical. "You can't change the spots on a leopard," said Jim Switzer, a Dimock resident who says drilling ruined his water. "They would spend a billion dollars to say they weren't responsible for something rather than spend a couple million dollars of taking care of who they screwed." Another drilling critic who battled Colorado's Encana Oil &amp; Gas for 10 years over its work around his property said he was angered not only by noise and pollution but also by industry attitudes. "Those people moved into our valley like a conquering army," said Thomas Thompson, who complained that the heavy equipment that accompanied drilling in Rifle, Colo., created endless dust storms that caused health problems for him and his wife. Thompson said he's never said the U.S. shouldn't develop natural gas resources, just that it should be done responsibly. After years of asking government agencies and the industry to address the problems, Thompson and his wife relocated to Texas and settled a lawsuit over his claims. The company said Thompson essentially "did not like having oil and gas activity on his property." "We realize that this is sometimes the case, particularly if an individual doesn't have mineral rights and receives no economic benefit from our presence and activity," Encana spokesman Doug Hock said in an email. "Generally, we're able to reach some sort of accommodation. In other cases, such as this one, it's not possible." Despite the anger from some critics, Hofmeister thinks many in the industry are "rather unemotional" about the opposition. "It's a big world," Hofmeister said. "The industry will move on to where it will be successful." ___ Follow Kevin Begos at https://twitter.com/kbegos
HARC.eduThe founding father of modern hydraulic fracturing, George P. Mitchell, passed away Friday at the age of 94. He led an amazing life: the son of Greek immigrants, Mitchell eventually became a billionaire. But he will be best remembered for fine-tuning the process that has transformed America's energy landscape. Despite its current ubiquity, the process remains mysterious and controversial. It involves a lot of weird, arcane equipment. And you can't see it happening since it occurs underground). There is some evidence it has contaminated water;†that spent frack fluid injected into the ground causes earthquakes; and that spilled wastewater has†neutered farm animals, though the industry vigorously disputes this.†If you've been affected by it, you're sometimes not allowed to talk about it. At the same time, the increased use of fracking has massively increased U.S. energy production. Oil imports are plummeting. The shale boom has†boosted employment. It's reducing energy costs. And many people are convinced the U.S. will soon become energy independent. And some say it's actually helping the environment by reducing emissions.† The Cynthia and George Mitchell Foundation is among the organizations trying to make sure fracking is sustainable and environmentally friendly. We recently went on a tour of a natural gas fracking site in rural Pennsylvania to see what fracking was all about.

Three years on, federal regulators are still figuring out how to implement and interpret the Dodd-Frank reform legislation. Thankfully for Wall Street, big banks and their lobbyists have been there every step of the way. This graphic from the Sunlight Foundation visualizes all active organizations and their cumulative meetings with federal regulators from June 2010 to June 2013. With 222 meetings, Goldman Sachs topped the list. JP Morgan came in at a close second, with 207 meetings. Those two banks alone participated in 50% more meetings than the top 20 most active pro-reform groups combined, according to the report. "In the 152 weeks our data cover, we find 59 weeks in which regulators met with financial sector representatives at least once every single day (Monday through Friday), and 47 weeks in which they met with financial sector representatives at least four times," writes Lee Drutman. "Financial institutions, especially the big banks, are dogged and ubiquitous. Pro-reform groups are stretched thin. Lawyers and lobbyists are also active participants, primarily representing the banks," according to the report "A number of other corporations show up frequently, most commonly in the energy and agro-business sectors, where derivatives and other market hedges are common practice."

Hedge fund billionaire Steven A. Cohen did not let the filing of criminal charges against his $14 billion SAC Capital Advisors get in the way of a party this weekend at his vacation estate in tony East Hampton, New York. The Saturday night party at Cohen's 10-bedroom home on Further Lane took place two days after federal prosecutors in New York announced the filing of a five-count criminal indictment against SAC Capital that portrayed the 21-year-old Stamford, Conn.-based fund as a breeding ground for unlawful insider trading. The lavish affair, which one source said included delivery of $2,000 worth of tuna from a local fish store to Cohen's home, was planned before the charges were filed. A person familiar with the event said the party attended by a few dozen people was intended by the 57-year-old manager to show support for ovarian cancer research, though it was not a fundraiser. On Friday, lawyers for SAC Capital entered a not guilty plea to the charges. Some in the hedge fund industry said a fierce determination to carry on business as usual was behind Cohen's decision to go ahead with the bash at his 9,000-square-foot home on a street famed for its waterfront mansions. Cohen, whose estimated fortune is $9 billion, set up shop in 1992 with just $25 million and earned a reputation as of the greatest stock traders of his generation. He built a firm that has posted a 25 percent average annual return, one of the best performance track records in the $2.4 trillion hedge fund industry, despite charging investors some of the highest fees. SAC Capital, after the indictment was announced, sent an email to employees and investors saying the firm would operate as normal. It stressed that prosecutors did not intend to take any action that would imperil the firm's ability to return some $4 billion in outside investor money by year's end. RARE MOVE RAISES QUESTIONS It's a rare move for federal prosecutors to indict a corporation, and it remains to be seen just how long Wall Street banks that lend money to SAC Capital and trade with it, will continue to do. It also remained to be seen whether Cohen, who faces no criminal charges himself, can keep his hedge fund empire together as a fully functioning firm employing nearly 1,000 people, with offices in eight cities around the globe. And it was unclear whether Cohen's more than 500 investment professionals, traders and analysts, will remain with the firm as the criminal proceeding unfolds. Investors have withdrawn most of the $6 billion in outside money the fund managed at the beginning of the year. "I would be running for the hills and looking for a job now if I were an SAC employee" said Mark Jordan, a veteran wealth management recruiter. "Who in their right mind would put money in SAC again?" A review of LinkedIn profiles for more than a dozen SAC Capital employees revealed that some have been connecting through the online networking site with Wall Street job recruiters. Up until recently, headhunters had said they were not seeing a flood of resumes from SAC employees, even after U.S. securities regulators filed a civil administrative complaint against Cohen on July 19 for failing to supervise two employees charged by prosecutors with insider trading.

Detroit recently filed for chapter 9 bankruptcy, the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history. But it was a long time coming, and it had everything to do with the once glorious U.S. auto industry. "Detroit, otherwise known as Motor City or Motown, was the center of the auto industry, making it a booming and prosperous city in the middle of last century," wrote Bank of America Merrill Lynch's Michelle Meyer. "The tide began to turn in the late 1970s/early 1980s when US automakers began to lose market share to Japanese ones. The Big Three ó GM, Chrysler and Ford ó were slower to adapt to technological changes and respond to demand for smaller and fuel-efficient vehicles." As the auto industry struggled, unemployment rose, people fled the city, and the economy shrunk while municipal spending remained high. Meyer's report included a 45-year chart of U.S. motor vehicle sales as a share of GDP to illustrate how the industry lagged the U.S. economy. "In the early 1980s the Big Three made up about 75% of total US auto sales, compared to just 45% of sales today," said Meyer. "And accordingly motor vehicle output has declined from 4.5% of GDP in the late 1960s to only 2.8% today." Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Another awesome interview from leading Wall Street career site, OneWire. This time, CEO Skiddy von Stade sits down with Glenn Hutchins, who is the Co-Founder of Silver Lake Partners. It's a part of OneWire's ongoing web series, Open Door. In the interview, Hutchins offers some solid career advice and discusses how he and his partners launched the largest technology-focused private equity firm in the world, which today manages approximately $23 billion in assets under management and committed capital. After earning both a JD and MBA from Harvard, Hutchins graduated without a full time job‚Äîdrawing some concern from both his professors and peers. Though he received offers from investment banks and consulting firms, Hutchins wanted something different. After engaging in contract work for nearly a year, he joined forces with entrepreneur Thomas H. Lee, who was restarting what became one of the first private equity firms in the country. Hutchins‚Äô impressive career has spanned both the public and private sectors, and in 1999, he co-founded the investment firm Silver Lake Partners. The idea behind Silver Lake was to establish a firm that specialized in private equity investments in large-cap technology and technology-enabled companies. Hutchins explains, ‚ÄúTechnology grows much faster than the rest of the economy and is‚Ä¶less susceptible to cyclical effects. And so you can invest with a tailwind‚Ä¶and you didn‚Äôt need as much leverage to be successful.‚Äù Since its founding, Silver Lake has invested in a number of successful technology and tech-enabled companies, including Skype, Alibaba, Avago, Seagate, and Instinet. Today, the firm is actively pursuing a highly publicized takeover of Dell. In the interview, Hutchins explains his firm‚Äôs hands-on approach to business, ‚ÄúMost private equity firms are the equivalent of the coxswain in the crew race. They sit at the back of the boat and shout, ‚ÄòStroke! Stroke!‚Äô And we get in the boat and row.‚Äù¬†

The most recent U.S. jobs report was overwhelmingly bullish. However, one detail that the naysayers pointed to was the uptick in part-time jobs and the downtick in full-time jobs. "In the aftermath of the June employment data, I have to say that rarely has such a solid report been so maligned," said Gluskin Sheff's David Rosenberg. "It got no respect -- all because full-time jobs fell while part-time jobs rose." Rosenberg argued the report confirmed that the "third act" of the economic recovery was in full swing. "What doesn't really add up with this focus on part-time employment is what the payroll data are telling us about labour income, which is now on a discernible uptrend," said Rosenberg in a note to clients earlier this week. "The aggregate wage bill has accelerated to over a 6% annual rate on both a three- and six-month basis, so it is difficult to square this with a view among some commentators that all the economy is doing is generating low-paying service sector jobs." So, despite the part-time shift, people are still getting paid more. Furthermore, the evidence suggests these part-time jobs are pretty good ones. "At the same time, a diffusion index of close to 60% would other wise suggest that, in fact, the dispersion of job creation is much wider than simply burger flippers and bell captains," added Rosenberg. Some suggest that this shift may be due to the Affordable Care Act, a.k.a. Obamacare, which would require more employers to offer health insurance or face penalties. However, the evidence for this remains unclear. Furthermore, many question the reliability of the recent part-time jobs stats. "This information, from the Household survey, which is not only notoriously volatile but also very limited in terms of sample size (60,000 households)," caveated Rosenberg. Deutsche Bank's Joe LaVorgna also raised doubts about the noise in the June numbers. "The ratio [of part-time jobs to all jobs] is currently 19.5% versus 19.6% in June 2012 and 19.8% in June 2011, although the latest reading was up from 19.2% in May," said LaVorgna in a recent note to clients. "Conceivably, this could have been due to the massive seasonal shift in the labor force that occurs among students and teachers ahead of the summer holiday. Therefore, it is probably prudent to wait another month or two to see if the ratio dips back down. Our guess is that it will since the ratio of part-time to total household employment roughly mirrors that of the unemployment rate. With the latter still high and well above estimates of full employment, an elevated share of part-time employment is not unusual." Still, like Rosenberg, LaVorgna notes that the evidence suggests the quality of jobs is improving. "[E]mployee tax withholding receipts continue to accelerate," said LaVorgna. "They grew around 6% in June which was their best June showing since 2007. Considering the fact that the level of employment is about 3 million lower today than it was then, the current growth in tax receipts is very impressive because it means that aggregate income growth may be understated. Anecdotally, this would suggest job quality, notwithstanding the very recent increase in part-time employment, is better than some analysts think." So, while the sound of a "part-time" job may not be so sexy, everything else that makes up the job description seems to be improving. And this is assuming that part-time jobs really are spiking.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. has expanded into the physical commodity markets aggressively over the past five years, first with the purchase of Bear Stearns in 2008 and most significantly with a $1.7 billion deal to buy RBS Sempra's global oil and metals business in 2010. On Friday the bank - which had become Wall Street's biggest trader in commodities - announced that it was putting the physical trading operations up for sale, quitting the business after months of intensifying pressure. The following are a selection of JPMorgan's physical trading assets and operations: ASSET: POWER PLANTS + ELECTRICTY TOLLING AND MARKETING AGREEMENTS DATE OF PURCHASE: March 2008 (JPMorgan buys Bear Stearns, including power subsidiary Bear Energy) DESCRIPTION: The bank's commodity division, known as JPMorgan Ventures Energy Corporation, has electricity trading deals with U.S. power plants and wind farms totaling almost 3,000 megawatts of capacity - enough to light up each one of Indiana's 2.8 million homes. In May the bank largely exited the Californian power market, where it has been embroiled in a market manipulation scandal, selling power interests totaling over 3,000 MW of capacity to Edison International. The bank's commodity division also has an equity interest in three entities that own power plants in the United States, including the 545 MW Kinder Jackson facility in Michigan, the 230 MW Brandywine plant in Maryland, and a 75 MW biomass plant in Florida. JPMorgan also owns interests in power plants and wind farms through its private equity arm, JPMorgan Capital Partners, and JPMorgan Infrastructure Investments Group, its asset management division. In late 2007, Bear Stearns' commodity arm, Houston-based Bear Energy, acquired the rights to more than 9,000 MW of electric power output after purchasing Williams Power Co. ASSET: Henry Bath, metals warehousing business DATE OF PURCHASE: July 2010 SELLER: RBS Sempra PRICE: Part of $1.7 billion RBS Sempra deal. DESCRIPTION: When RBS Sempra was bought by JPMorgan for $1.6 billion in 2010, it was the second-largest warehousing company in the LME's vast network with almost 100 warehouses. Since then it has been eclipsed by Goldman Sach's warehouse business Metro International and Glencore Xstrata's Pacorini, and is now the fourth largest based on the number of sheds. The company was a founder member of the LME in 1877 and issued the first LME warrant on December 20 1883. The company motto is "habere et dispertire" - to have and to share. Tracing its roots back to 18th century England, the Liverpool, UK-based company was eventually bought by Metallgesellschaft in 1986. Until then, the company had largely been a trading house and ship operator. Hollywood actress Catherine Zeta Jones is reportedly named after the Henry Bath ship "Zeta" that was captained by her great grandfather. It now has 72 warehousing locations in 11 countries. STATUS: RBS Sempra was told by the Federal Reserve it must divest Henry Bath within two years of the launch of its 2008 joint venture, and JPMorgan was believed to be facing similar pressure to divest the business. ASSET: (UBS) Commodities Canada DATE OF PURCHASE: Feb 2009 DESCRIPTION: Bought from UBS in 2009, the Calgary-based trading division helped JPMorgan gain a foothold in the heart of the Canadian oil sands industry. It trades, transports and stores natural gas, crude and power. "We provide extensive physical capabilities, specifically transport and warehousing, and specialize in trading and structuring across energy products, including oil, natural gas and power," the company says on its website detailing its Canadian operations. The bank said in 2010 that it was growing its Natural Resources Group, hiring senior oil and gas traders in Calgary. LONG-TERM TRADING DEALS: * NORTHERN TIER REFINERY: In December 2010, JPMorgan agreed to provide crude oil to Northern Tier Energy's 82,000 barrel per day (bpd) refinery in St. Paul, Minnesota. It now supplies more than 90 percent of the refinery's crude, according to Northern Tier's SEC filings, including about 10,000 bpd imported from Canada last year, EIA data show. * PHILADELPHIA ENERGY SOLUTIONS REFINERY: Last summer JPMorgan agreed to provide financing and crude supply to the 335,000 bpd refinery in Philadelphia as part of a buy-out by the Carlyle Group. Since September it has been importing some 250,000 bpd of crude from Nigeria, Chad and Azerbaijan. The deal helped the bank treble its crude imports last year to nearly 130,000 bpd, the data show, overtaking Morgan Stanley's crude and fuel imports for the first time ever.

Three years ago, former Citibanker Mike Russell turned to his friend at Bank of America, Mike Scharf, with a business idea.¬† The New Yorkers had busy lives and thus, messy apartments. They also had disposable incomes. But when you live in a non-doorman building with no cleaning service readily available, getting your home cleaned can be tough.  Cleaning services are largely found via word of mouth or direct mail advertisements. A reliable, easy to peruse database of cleaning people online didn't exist. The pair bootstrapped MyClean with the help of a $267,000 friends and family round of financing. The site makes finding and ordering a cleaning service in the New York City area as easy as ordering food on Seamless or GrubHub. Scharf and Russell had to overcome a lot to make the business work. They scrapped the original idea to outsource cleaners after clients received disappointing results and left scathing Yelp reviews. Problems with the site were tough to fix; neither Scharf nor Russell are technical. But now Scharf and Russell have created a business that sustains more than just themselves.¬† MyClean oversees every part of the cleaning cycle, from managing site orders to dispatching its workers to various locations on the fly. Scharf, the company's CEO, works with government sponsored agencies to find people who are looking for a steady paycheck, gives them training, and hires them as full-time cleaners working six days per week. MyClean now employees 125 cleaners in addition to the dozen people who oversee the entire operation. Scharf estimates his staff cleans 1,000 homes and businesses each each week. Users are loyal; 80% buy into MyClean's subscription model, which allows them to book cleaners consistently every week, two weeks or month. There's a 5-15% discount given to subscribers, who can also pick how thoroughly they want their residences cleaned. To tidy up a one bedroom, one bath in Manhattan, the going rate is $84. To get it really clean, it's $135. If your house is in really bad shape, MyClean's team will give it a deep clean, which includes a complete wipe down of the oven, cabinet shelves and more for a little over $200. Tip is not included. Cleaners can be dispatched the same day you order the service, as long as the request is in before 4:00 PM. At $135 for a thorough clean, it's more expensive than a cleaning service you could find yourself. But MyClean makes it so easy to find and book a cleaning online, many people don't mind paying a little extra.¬† MyClean isn't profitable yet; it's breaking even. But as the cleaning startup space heats up (venture-backed Exec recently launched a competitor on the west coast for example), MyClean's business is too. Under the leadership of Ken Schultz, a former lawyer who is MyClean's VP of Operations,¬†MyClean is generating $4-5 million annually. It's raking in $400,000 per month, up from $15,000 a few years ago. To continue growing the business, MyClean will be launching a mobile app and expand to more cities. Currently, the service only operates in Manhattan, Queens, Bronx and Brooklyn. Scharf's team is eying New Jersey cities where many New York City commuters live. For Scharf, a first-time entrepreneur, growing a multi-million-dollar business hasn't been predictable. When asked what's surprised him most about running a startup he replied,¬†"You have to be willing to do everything yourself and follow through."
Overstock.com CEO Patrick Byrne colorfully explained in his own words why he took out a full page ad in the Wall Street Journal mocking SAC Capital's Steve Cohen Saturday. "Cohen's life work is being destroyed," he wrote in a note to Business Insider, "I feel good.¬†Shooting SAC Capital dead and throwing all of its employees into the streets is simply civilization scraping some dog--- off its shoe. ¬†I felt it was time I spent $100k on a derisive ad in order to say that." A Federal Grand Jury indicted SAC Capital on charges of insider trading this week after years of investigation. Meanwhile, since 2005 Byrne has been saying that powerful market actors have been working to destroy his company. In 2010 he identified them as Michael Milken and SAC's Steven Cohen. Two years later, emails accidentally leaked by lawyers representing a number of Wall Street banks described how the banks were allegedly naked short-selling Overstock.com stock and advising their hedge fund clients on how to do the same. SAC Capital, as you know, is one massive hedge fund client. "Eight¬†years ago I was roundly criticized by coming out publicly and saying, in brief: A network of dirty hedge funds were practicing all kinds of dicey practices, including insider trading and naked short selling (and being serial killers of firms in the process)," Byrne wrote. "The SEC was not doing its job protecting our markets because it is a captured regulator, and this combination was destabilizing the system." He continued: "Also that the mastermind, the Napoleon of crime, so to speak, was someone I initially identified as the "Sith Lord" of all that was evil and wrong on Wall Street. In the months after, I gradually dropped broader and broader public hints that I was talking about Stevie Cohen. Of course, through all of this my claims were spun,¬†ridiculed, and mocked." If the documents leaked by bank lawyers are any indication, Overstock was not only being ridiculed by the media, but also by insiders at Wall Street banks. Naked short selling (or "failing" a stock) is the practice of shorting a stock that has never actually been borrowed. It's illegal, in part, because it creates fake supply of a stock, and in 2005 and 2006 Overstock.com claims naked short-selling created six times the actual supply of its stock in the market. Someone might choose to naked short sell a stock when the stock is a¬†negative rebate stock ‚Äî too expensive to borrow. That's why it sounded so damning when the emails leaked from banks said things like this: "We are NOT borrowing negatives... I have made that clear from the beginning. Why would we want to borrow them? We want to fail them," said one Merrill exec. Now that you're clear on that, this portion of Byrne's note will make more sense (emphasis ours): "Cohen is directly responsible for corruption in our capital markets that has cost hundreds of thousands, maybe millions of people, their jobs," he said. "Now SAC has been indicted, and Cohen's life work is being destroyed, I feel good: Shooting SAC Capital dead and throwing all of its employees into the streets is simply civilization scraping some dogs--- off its shoe.¬†I felt it was time I spent $100k on a derisive ad in order to say that." "Besides," Byrne added, "if you're not going to kick a man when he's down, when¬†are¬†you going to kick him?" So that explains that, then. 
REUTERS/Eric ThayerMeredith Whitney says Detroit will be just the first in a tidal wave of municipal defaults. Those who share a similar, if perhaps less extreme, view¬†have fingered Chicago as the next big city to go under. The city just got downgraded by Moody's, and is now having to lay off teachers. Pete Saunders, an urban planner who grew up in Detroit and now lives in Chicago, offers evidence that outcome is unlikely. Writing in Crain's Chicago Business¬†this week, he lays out three main elements that will allow Chicago to escape Detroit's fate: ¬†¬† 1) Chicago is way bigger: A report from the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis released in February¬†shows that Chicago metro area GDP in 2011 was $548 billion annually, making it the third largest in the nation after New York and Los Angeles. That makes the Chicago economy nearly three times larger than Detroit's, which checks in at $199 billion. Chicago's economy is also more diverse than Detroit's, with no one industry sector making up more than 13 percent of the metro area workforce. 2) Chicago's fiscal structure is less concentrated than Detroit's: the dozens of municipal corporations and special-purpose districts here, lacking in Detroit, meant the fiscal burden could be spread around. As a result, City Hall ends up having fewer direct responsibilities and a slightly rosier fiscal picture. 3) The two cities have fundamentally different characters in a way no one really talks about: There was a certain disposableness built into Detroit ‚Äî cheaply built homes and low-quality business districts dominate much of the city. Disposability long ago sent a message to Detroiters: As you move up, you move out. Chicago, meanwhile, was built with a sense of permanence. Chicago has a physical character that tells its residents that it is worth having, worth saving. In sum: Chicago has problems, but Detroit remains a unique mess.
Business Insider/Matthew Boesler, data from BloombergLately, it's been slow in markets. These are the dog days of summer, after all. Perhaps the best visual representation of the slowdown in activity is trading volume in the Treasury market, shown in the chart at right. Treasuries took center stage in May and June when a big sell-off there roiled markets around the world, and trading volume rose to an all-time high. This past week, trading volume is plumbing lows not seen since Christmas break. Next week, though, is bound to shake things up. "Risk events are set to pick up dramatically, threatening the summer lull," says Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale head of rates and forex strategy Vincent Chaigneau. "Risk conditions are sanguine, but exposed to renewed pressure on Treasuries." Major events include the Federal Reserve's July FOMC meeting, which concludes Wednesday; European Central Bank and Bank of England policy meetings, which conclude on Thursday; and a host of key economic data releases in the United States, including the first reading of second-quarter GDP and ADP's monthly private payroll report on Wednesday, two key reports on manufacturing from ISM and Markit and monthly vehicle sales figures on Thursday, and the headliner: the jobs report on Friday. Sprinkled in the mix are factory orders, consumer spending and personal income, initial jobless claims, regional manufacturing reports out of the Federal Reserve banks in Dallas and Chicago, Case-Shiller home prices, and pending home sales. And we haven't even mentioned global PMI day, when we get updates on the state of manufacturing in major economies all around the world. Needless to say, there will be a lot for financial markets to digest. "Our economists had long predicted weakness over Q2, and expect data to strengthen this summer," says Chaigneau. "That should start as early as this week, with the manufacturing PMI seen in the 53 region (a level not seen over the past four months) and [nonfarm payrolls] at 200,000."

Forget Gordon Gekko. Old-style City traders are being replaced by maths geniuses who use super-computers to beat the markets. But are 'quants‚Äô a force for good or evil? At seven minutes past one on the afternoon of Tuesday April 23 this year a tweet from the AP news agency in Washington was published. It read ‚ÄúBreaking: Two Explosions in the White House and Barack Obama is injured.‚Äù This was not true ‚Äì the AP account had been hacked by a shady group of technology nerds calling themselves The Syrian Electronic Army ‚Äì but within milliseconds the tweet had been noticed and flagged by trading computers on Wall Street. Programmed to scan the internet for words or phrases that might affect stock markets, the unthinking machines had immediately seized upon the tweet, noted the proximity of the words ‚ÄúObama‚Äù, ‚Äúexplosions‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhite House‚Äù and unleashed a torrent of trades. Within seconds, the Dow Jones had plunged 140 points and more than $200 billion of capital had been wiped out. A few minutes later the report was exposed as a hoax and the markets quickly returned to their pre-tweet levels. But, to many, the idea that one fake tweet could have such an enormous impact on the financial markets was incredible. Who was running Wall Street? Humans or machines? If you thought ‚Äúhumans‚Äù, you were woefully out of date. Over the past decade or so there has been a technological coup d‚Äôetat on the trading floor. The old ‚ÄúMasters of the Universe‚Äù ‚Äì the Gordon Gekko types with their slicked-back hair and $5,000 suits ‚Äì have been superseded by unbelievably powerful computers capable of analysing vast amounts of data and buying or selling shares in the blink of an eye. Today, if you visit a trading floor, instead of pumped-up men in loose ties screaming down the phone, you are more likely to see rows of studious-looking people (most of them still men) sitting in front of computer screens, quietly monitoring trades being carried out on their behalf by machines. Around 70% of the orders to buy or sell on Wall Street are now placed by software programs, and the studious-looking people, mathematical geniuses who are responsible for writing these programs, are the new ‚Äúsmartest guys in the room‚Äù. It is the age of the algorithm. Mathematicians made their first forays into the financial world in the late Sixties. Edward Thorp, a professor of mathematics at the University of California, published a book in 1967 called Beat the Market in which he laid out what he claimed was a foolproof way of making money on the stock market, all based on a system he had previously devised to beat casinos at blackjack. The blackjack system had been so successful it had forced casinos to change their rules and Beat the Market ‚Äì which had to do with selling stocks and bonds at one price and buying them back at a lower price ‚Äì proved to be even more groundbreaking. In 1974, Thorp founded a hedge fund called Princeton/Newport Partners and proceeded to make a killing on the¬†markets. At the same time, the job prospects for scientists had nosedived. Since the 1969 moon landing, the American government had cut funding for science programmes and diverted it to the war in Vietnam. ‚ÄúA generation of physicists who had gone to graduate school left with their PhDs and entered a severely depressed job market,‚Äù explains James Owen Weatherall, author of The Physics of Finance. They had to earn a living somehow, and, seeing how much money that there was to be made on Wall Street, many decided to move into finance. In Britain, the fall of the Soviet Union led to an influx of Warsaw Pact scientists. In both cases, these scientists brought with them a new methodology based on analysing data and also a faith that, using sufficient computing firepower, it was possible to predict the market. It was the start of a new discipline, quantitative analysis, and the most famous ‚Äúquant‚Äù of all was a shambling donnish maths genius with a scraggly beard and aversion to socks called Jim Simons. For those who know their physics, Simons is a living legend. A piece of mathematics he co-created, the Chern-Simons 3-form, is one of the most important elements of string theory, the so-called ‚Äútheory of everything‚Äù. Highly academic, Simons never seemed the sort of person who would gravitate to the earthy environs of Wall Street. But in 1982, he founded an extraordinarily successful hedge fund management company, Renaissance Technologies, whose signature fund, Medallion, went on to earn an incredible 2,478.6 per cent return in its first 10 years, way above every other hedge fund on the planet, including George Soros‚Äôs Quantum Fund. Its success, based on a highly complex and secretive algorithm, continued in the Noughties and over the lifetime of the fund, Medallion‚Äôs returns have averaged 40 per cent a year, making Simons one of the richest men in the world with a net worth in excess of $10billion. Of his 200 employees, ensconced in a fortress-like building in unfashionable Long Island, New York, a third have PhDs, not in finance, but in fields like physics, mathematics and statistics. Renaissance has been called ‚Äúthe best physics and mathematics department in the world‚Äù and, according to Weatherall, ‚Äúavoids hiring anyone with even the slightest whiff of Wall Street bona fides. PhDs in finance need not apply; nor should traders who got their start at traditional investment banks or even other hedge funds. The secret to Simons‚Äôs success has been steering clear of the financial experts.‚Äù Not surprisingly, old-style traders hate the quants. Not only have they pushed them off the top of the trading tree, there is also a basic clash of cultures. They are not flash and, invariably, rather awkward socially. As one anonymous software salesman who deals with hedge funds relates on a blog: ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt do small talk. When one of them picks me up from reception and we ride the elevator, I have learnt not to start chatting away about, say, the weather. They simply don‚Äôt seem to understand. They think you‚Äôre attempting to communicate something apparently important about meteorological conditions. Same thing with innocent jokes‚Ä¶ blank stares.‚Äù So what exactly do quantitative analysts do? Patrick Boyle and Jesse McDougall run a hedge fund which they operate out of an Islington town house. Their offices are next to the sort of ethical caf√© whose owners would probably be horrified at the rampant capitalism on display next door. When I meet them they are seated in a small room dominated by three computer screens. They start work at seven in the morning and end around 11 at night. ‚ÄúWe have computer screens in our kitchen and living room,‚Äù says Boyle, 37. ‚ÄúSo we can monitor the markets while having dinner and we can log in remotely if we are out in the evening.‚Äù He shows me a chart tracking his fund‚Äôs performance. The line doesn‚Äôt dip when the rest of the market dips and rises faster than the FTSE. How do they do it? ‚ÄúWe do it with maths,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWe buy stock market data and we analyse it. It‚Äôs like weather forecasting ‚Äì we can say that there is a 65 per cent probability that the market will be up between open and close, so we are able to have better than 50 per cent odds on short-term movements and over time if you call short term well, you can make money.‚Äù Who wrote the computer program they use? ‚ÄúI did,‚Äù says Boyle. How do you write something like that? ‚ÄúSlowly.‚Äù The writing of the program may be slow but the speed of transactions is super fast. Some quants specialise in what is called High Frequency Trading (HFT), which involves large numbers of trades over very short periods of time. ‚ÄúIn one millisecond the price could go up by one penny,‚Äù says McDougall. ‚ÄúYou do it thousands of times on hundreds of shares and you make money.‚Äù Boyle and McDougall‚Äôs hedge fund doesn‚Äôt do high frequency trades, so to find out more I meet Simon Jones, who was running the quants desk at a major bank up until a few months ago. He is 36 years old. ‚ÄúThe guys and women who worked with me were the best of the best. They came from all over the world: from India, Russia and China.‚Äù The job was intense and highly competitive. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs say I have noticed that the moment the Dow goes up the FTSE goes up,‚Äù says Jones. ‚ÄúThe first person to notice that and make a trade can make money but to do that means getting the data from New York to London and then getting my trading decision across the Atlantic and me buying my FTSE before anyone else does.‚Äù In this game speed is critical and that has led to what has been dubbed an arms race between firms. It has got to a point where firms have actually started moving their servers¬†nearer to an exchange to speed up connection times. In 2010, a company called Spread Networks laid a new direct cable between New York and Chicago, going straight through the Allegheny mountains, which shaved a little bit more than 1,000th of a second off the transmission time between stock exchanges. For the opportunity to use a similarly fast tube between New York and London, Jones‚Äôs old bank was asked to pay $50 million. ‚ÄúIt would have given us an advantage over others of about a six thousandths of one second,‚Äù says Jones. This focus on the shortest of short-term gains has vastly increased volatility. ‚ÄúWarren Buffett owns shares in Coca-Cola and when they go down he says 'I‚Äôm holding on to them because I think they will go back up‚Äô,‚Äù says Jones. ‚ÄúBut the HFT guy, all he cares about is the next millisecond. And when too many people start panicking about the next millisecond that‚Äôs when you have a crash.‚Äù The perfect example of such a crash took place on May 6 2010. So many shares were traded that day that the online trading section of the New York Stock Exchange temporarily froze and between 2.30pm and 3pm the Dow Jones lost and then regained nearly $1 trillion. In what became known as the ‚ÄúFlash Crash‚Äù, shares in the management consultancy firm Accenture plummeted to a fraction above zero . Apple shares went up to $100,000. ‚ÄúNone of us knew what to do or what would happen next,‚Äù says Dave Lauer, a quant who was working on a HFT desk that day. ‚ÄúIt was terrifying.‚Äù For Lauer, the Flash Crash was a wake-up call. ‚ÄúI started to see how the race to be fastest had left things in a very fragile state,‚Äù he tells me. The following year his wife revealed she was pregnant which prompted him to make a big decision. ‚ÄúI remember thinking, 'How will I explain to my future child what I do for a living?‚Äô‚Äù Lauer quit his job and last year told the Senate Banking committee that High Frequency Trading had brought the market to crisis point. The Flash Crash was partly caused by the HFT strategy of ‚Äúspoofing‚Äù; making bogus offers to buy or sell shares to flush out the intentions of rivals. On the day, an astonishing 19.4 billion shares were traded, more than were traded in the entirety of the Sixties, but hundreds of millions of them were never actually sold; they were merely held for a few thousandths of a second as traders tested the waters. Isn‚Äôt there something wrong with a system that promotes so much volatility to the benefit of no one except a handful of hedge funds? Can it be a meaningful investment of time¬†and technology? Warren Buffett‚Äôs business partner, Charlie Munger, has¬†described High Frequency Trading as ‚Äúbasically evil‚Äù. ‚ÄúI think it is very stupid to allow a system to evolve where half of the trading is a bunch of short-term people trying to get information one millionth of a nanosecond ahead of somebody else,‚Äù he said earlier this year. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs legalised front-running.‚Äù HFT is certainly of no clear benefit to everyday investors - savers in pension funds and life policies. The quants I meet don‚Äôt believe what they do is necessarily dangerous but they do voice some doubts. ‚ÄúSome of the guys who come from pure science and maths backgrounds are used to solving a problem and it works,‚Äù Patrick Boyle says. ‚ÄúThey think they can find a formula that will perfectly describe how the market moves. That is the philosopher‚Äôs stone ‚Äì it is utterly impossible.‚Äù The danger is that in only seeing numbers and patterns the human dimension is forgotten. After 16 years in the City, Simon Jones is now planning to go travelling. ‚ÄúA quant can earn up to seven figures,‚Äù he tells me, ‚Äúbut sometimes I do wonder whether I contributed positively to society.‚Äù And what does he conclude? He pauses. ‚ÄúI was working with the best of the best,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúMy bank employed the brightest engineers, chemists and scientists ‚Äì and we were all working together to get richer. The chemical and physics and health industries are worse off because of what we do because I tell you this: if there was a pay bonus structure similar to what we had in the City for curing cancer, we‚Äôd have found a cure for cancer.‚Äù I find that sad and a little bit frightening. So, I ask, quants: good or bad? Jones looks at me and says, ‚ÄúHumans just found a new way of being greedy.‚Äù

The facility was built for children to take part in after school programs in the arts, sciences, sports, computer and vocational training. U.S. GDP has been on the rise since the financial crisis, but it has been sluggish. And with corporate revenues stagnating, earnings growth is slowing significantly. However, this is no reason to be bearish about the future, argues J.P. Morgan's Tom Lee. "There is pent-up demand in the U.S.," said Lee as he cranked up his target for the S&amp;P 500. "As for the U.S. and to a lesser extent for Europe, this is more than ‚Äúeasing financial conditions‚Äù but a story of pent-up demand," said Lee addressing economic growth prospects. "As shown in Figure 8, investment/durables spending in the U.S. remains at 60-year lows. And at a time when the age of capital- stock is near record highs (see Figure 9/Figure 10). This is a formula, in our view, for obsolescence asserting itself in the form of an eventual sharp rise in spending." JP Morgan JP Morgan JP Morgan
Nicole BettsNicole BettsAt age 33, Nicole Betts was bringing home a six-figure pay packet as an expatriate property manager in Dubai. Three years on, sheís now earning $20/hour from odd jobs like buying a businessmanís birthday present for his daughter ñ and loving life. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics,†about 1 in 5 of Australian workers†were employed in casual jobs as of November. Workers unions have warned that casual workers have†little social and economic security†but for some, like Betts, casual work is a lifestyle decision. ìA few years ago, I went through a quarter-life crisis, where I felt that I was existing but not living my life,î Betts told Business Insider. ìI didnít hate my life; I just didnít love what I did.î When she decided to leave full-time employment in 2010, Betts had spent 15 years in the real estate industry, including 3 years as an expatriate with Asteco Property Management in Dubai. She worked an extra 6 months for a bit of a ìnest eggî to go travelling and returned to Australia late last year to study environments, landscape management and medical humanities at the University of Melbourne. ìThe life of an expat is very much a work hard, play hard kind of life,î Betts said. ìItís an artificial environment that was a really great experience for awhile. ìIt was really great to have stability and money, and itís a very opulent lifestyle. But I donít want to work 40-plus hours a week. I want to be able to do things that I enjoy.î Betts pays for her rent, expenses and stress-management start-up People Outside Walking by completing odd jobs on†tasks listing site Sidekicker. She charges $29/hour ñ of which Sidekicker takes a $9 cut ñ for completing jobs like making and handing out smoothies and being a ìbrand ambassadorî at marketing events. A growing market for task-based work Sites like Freelancer.com, Airtasker and Sidekicker have attracted a Australian following in recent years by offering to match up those in need of work and those in need of workers for ultra short-term tasks like administration and events. Earlier this month,†Airtasker struck a major partnership†with News Corpís CareerOne that will put Airtasker advertisements in front of some 1.3 million CareerOne job seekers a month. The deal was initiated by CareerOne: a sign that larger players have noticed a growing market for ultra short-term work. Jacqui Bull, who turned down an accounting job at Deloitte to co-found Sidekicker, said her site had attracted companies like retailers or event organisers that might otherwise have used temp agencies to fill vacancies during particularly busy times. ìWe have a one-hour minimum, so you donít have to go through the hassle of booking someone in for a few days. We also have a lower price point ñ $29 an hour is the minimum and standard, whereas temping is $38-$45,î she said. Sidekicker interviews all the casual staff it recommends to potential employers. Of the 100 or so ìsidekicksî currently active on the site, Bull said about 30% were non-Australian travellers ñ typically from the US or UK. A majority of sidekicks were aged between 22 and 30, and 95% either had university degrees or were working towards them, she said. ìWith the casualisation of the workforce, we kind of see [Sidekicker as] an interim source of income while [people] are focusing on getting their dream job,î she told Business Insider. ìThey donít want to settle [for a any old job], so they might need a couple of extra monthsí [casual] work. So many of our sidekicks work with us for 6 months, before getting a full-time job. Itís just a natural progression. ìNo one sacks an employee and gets sidekicks in; itís an additional resource for when they donít need a full-time person in the business but occasionally need a few extra hands on deck.î Former property manager Betts said doing odd jobs was a temporary measure for her, while she worked on getting her start-up off the ground. But in the long run, she said she would consider accepting the odd Sidekicker posting every once in awhile, ìThere are some Sidekicker jobs that I quite like and that are quite aligned to my values,î she said. ìEvery day is different now, and Iím constantly learning.î Now read:†In One Chart, Hereís How Many Australians Fall Into Gen X, Gen Y And Other Categories Follow Business Insider Australia on†Facebook†and†Twitter
REUTERS/Jim YoungU.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke answers questions about the inflation rate during his testimony before the Joint Economic Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, April 27, 2006.The unemployment currently sits at 7.6%.† If America adds jobs, then that rate goes down. But that's not the only thing that'll make it fall. If American's drop out of the labor force, then they can't complain about not having a job. So they aren't factored into the unemployment rate equation. In other words, if the labor force participation rate (LFPR) falls, then all things being equal, the unemployment rate will fall as well. And the LFPR has been falling. Now, the Federal Reserve had said that a 6.5% unemployment rate target would be one of the two measures it would use in guiding decisions about monetary policy. However, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has also said that the current unemployment rate may be misrepresenting the health of the job market. "If a substantial part of the reductions in measured unemployment were judged to reflect cyclical declines in labor force participation rather than gains in employment, the Committee would be unlikely to view a decline in unemployment to 6-1/2 percent as a sufficient reason to raise its target for the federal funds rate," said Bernanke in a recent testimony to Congress. For economist trying to forecast when the Fed will taper its quantitative easing program and tighten monetary policy, these comments complicate things a bit. So the fine folks over at Barclays took it upon themselves to look at any recent comments that members of the Fed have said regarding the labor force participation rate. Some commentary from Barclays' US Rates Strategy team led by Rajiv Setia: A continued fall in LFPR poses a risk to ratesGiven the Fedís increased emphasis on the unemployment rate that we have documented for the past few weeks, a continued fall in the LFPR poses a risk for rates; by our estimates, consensus expectations for unemployment assume flat LFPR. A decline in participation would cause the unemployment rate to fall at a faster pace than the Fed and consensus are presuming. ...the LFPR has dropped nearly 2% since the end of the recession, accounting for a significant part of the decline in the unemployment rate (the employment- population ratio has improved very little since the recession ended). But the implications for monetary policy, and hence the future path of rates, are very different depending on the reason behind the decline in LFPR. A view that the current low level of the LFPR is cyclical argues for a more dovish policy, while a view that it is mostly demographic argues for a more hawkish policy. Clearly, how the LFPR evolves over the next year will be critical to the rates market. Barclays
