China's "no stimulus" pledge and falling commodity prices are sending US inflation expectations to multi-year lows. Below is the 5-year inflation expectation indicator (breakeven) implied by inflation-linked treasuries (TIPS). FREDThe 5-year real rates in the US have recently turned positive, which some would suggest represents tighter monetary conditions. With real rates on the rise, the Fed will have a great deal of room to "slowroll" the rate hikes. If inflation expectations fall further, we may see a more dovish stance from the FOMC.

Al Bello/Getty ImagesYale hasn't beaten Harvard in football since 2006, but its endowment has outperformed Harvard's over the last 20 years.Yale's endowment keeps outperforming Harvard's.  On Wednesday, Yale announced that in the fiscal year ended June 30, the university's endowment earned a 20.2% investment return, topping the 15.4% returned by Harvard's endowment over the same period.  Last year, Yale's endowment grew to $23.9 billion from $20.8 billion, still significantly smaller than Harvard's endowment of $36.4 billion as of June 30.  Looking at the past performance of these endowments, however, 2013's outperformance by Yale wasn't unique.  Over the most recent 10- and 20-year periods, Yale has outperformed Harvard, and not by a meaningless amount. Yale's investment return over the last 10 years stands at 11% against Harvard's 8.9% return. Over 20 years, Yale has returned 13.9% per year, while Harvard has seen returns of 12.3%.  When looking at the composition of the endowments' portfolio, the biggest discrepancy is in allocation to private equity and hedge funds. Yale puts 30% of its invested capital in private equity against 18% for Harvard, while Yale puts 20% of its capital in hedge funds while Harvard puts about 16% of its capital in hedge funds. Conversely, Harvard has more in natural resources, plain-vanilla stocks, and bonds and cash (which are very low risk).  Here's the full breakdown of the differences in how the endowments are invested: In its annual report for 2014, Harvard said, "One factor that continues to impact our performance is a real and visible overhang from underperforming illiquid investments made during the pre-crisis era. These investments will continue to roll off over the next few years."  On Wednesday, Harvard also announced that Stephen Blyth, formerly the managing director and head of public markets at Harvard Management Co., which runs the company's endowment, to the CEO role. Blyth's appointment comes after the head of Harvard's endowment, Jane Mendillo, stepped down in June.  A 2013 study showed that from 2009 to 2013, Harvard's endowment saw the worst returns among Ivy League institutions.   Good luck, Stephen!

Thomson ReutersThe U.S. flag flies at the Burt GM auto dealer in DenverDETROIT (Reuters) - The fund to compensate for deaths or injuries linked to General Motors Co  vehicles with faulty ignition switches this week made its first cash offers to about 15 people, the office of the lawyer overseeing the program said on Wednesday. The fund will pay at least $1 million for each death claim or more if they had dependants. GM has set aside $400 million to cover the compensation costs. The total number of claims filed by Wednesday was up to 850 from the 675 claims through last Friday, including 150 death claims, said an official with the office of lawyer Kenneth Feinberg. The fund has approved 21 death claims so far. Camille Biros, deputy administrator of the fund, said that the cash offers were made verbally in the last two days, and included cases of death as well as some people who were injured. The program will continue to receive applications until the end of this year on behalf of individuals injured or killed in accidents they say were caused by the switch, which led to the recall of 2.6 million vehicles earlier this year. A problem with the switch can cause it to slip out of position, stalling the vehicle and disabling air bags. Feinberg, in an earlier interview with Reuters, said he could not be certain how many claims will end up being filed, nor how many he and his staff will determine are eligible for payments. He said that some claims arrive to his office without enough documentation, which causes a delay in the determination of their eligibility.

Scott Knuteson/USAFThe US and allied partners struck oil refineries held by the extremist group calling itself the Islamic State on Wednesday, the Pentagon said.  US Central Command said the 13 airstrikes targeted 12 oil refineries held by the Islamic State, which is also known as ISIS or ISIL. The oil refineries were located in remote areas in eastern Syria, near Al Mayadin, Al Hasakah, and Abu Kamal. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates also participated in the airstrikes, Central Command said. "We are still assessing the outcome of the attack on the refineries, but have initial indications that the strikes were successful," Central Command said in a statement. One airstrike also targeted an ISIS vehicle. The vehicle was destroyed. For ISIS, which is now the wealthiest terrorist group in the world, oil is a key source of riches. ISIS is believed to have taken control of hundreds of oil wells in Syria from both the government and moderate rebels, and the Syrian regime of President Bashar Assad has said it has lost about $4 billion in stolen oil amid the country's ongoing civil war. ISIS, meanwhile, earns as much as $2 million per day illegally selling oil, Central Command said. The group produces anywhere between 300 and 500 barrels of refined petroleum per day. "These small-scale refineries provided fuel to run ISIL operations, money to finance their continued attacks throughout Iraq and Syria, and an economic asset to support their future operations," Central Command said. According to Janine Davidson and Emerson Brookings of the Council on Foreign Relations, ISIS has access to "a volume of resources and territory unmatched in the history of extremist organizations." And according to the Brookings Institute, ISIS controls about 60% of Syria’s oil fields and several oil-producing assets in Iraq. Before these airstrikes, the US had conducted 20 strikes against ISIS-held targets in Syria since Monday. Military forces have also carried out nearly 200 airstrikes against the group in Iraq. Reuters CORRECTION: This post originally said the Syrian government claims it has lost nearly $4 million in oil revenues amid the ongoing Syrian civil war. The correct number is $4 billion.

Companies that have female directors out perform those that only have men. A Credit Suisse report found that, overall, companies with a market cap greater than US$ 10 billion that have at least one woman on the board of directors outperformed those that had no women at all by 26% for large caps over the six years leading up to 2011. "Importantly, this mix of companies would also have outperformed global equities as measured by MSCI’s ACWI," write Credit Suisse analysts Julia Dawson, Richard Kersley and Stefano Natella. In other words, this is a global phenomenon. From 2012 to June 2014, companies with at least one woman on the board have seen a 5% outperformance on a sector neutral basis. That amounts to a compound excess return since 2005 of 3.3%. Credit Suisse Credit Suisse Credit Suisse Credit Suisse FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Mark BlinchBob Lutz(R) chatting with Elon Musk in 2010 Former General Motors vice chairman Bob Lutz announced Wednesday on CNBC that he believes Tesla is "grossly overvalued" right now.  The outspoken automotive executive, who made the comment on the network's "Squawk Alley" program, echoed a sentiment expressed by Tesla-founder Elon Musk earlier this month.  Although Musk didn't go quite as far as Lutz — the Tesla CEO simply expressed some doubts about how high his company's stock has climbed in recent months. Lutz told CNBC, "Elon Musk is right. It's grossly overvalued right now," Lutz said. "When you look at it, their total production to date is still less than one day's production of General Motors or Ford, so it's filled with a lot of hype." Since Musk made his comments on Sept. 5,  Tesla stock has fallen from $286 to around $250 per share. In the segment, Lutz also cautioned that until Tesla builds a successful smaller and cheaper model with 200-300 miles of range — something it's planning to do with the upcoming Model 3 — it will remain a "fringe" brand.  Lutz — whose legendary career include executive positions at Ford, BMW, and Chrysler — maintains that the current lithium-ion battery technology being used by electric carmakers provides only limited range. If you want to travel farther, you have to go for a $100,000 Tesla, he argued — and that's a "limited market" in his estimation. .   FREE AppDownload
Cisco has no interest in buying EMC despite rumors to the contrary, CEO John Chambers says. Cisco's name had been floated around as a possible suitor after talks of a mega-merger between EMC and HP ground to halt, as reported by the WSJ earlier this week. "If Joe and I were going to do something here we would have done it a year or two ago," Chambers told people gathered for a breakfast Wednesday hosted by The Wall Street Journal. He was referring to EMC CEO Joe Tucci. That's not really surprising, though it would have been interesting if Cisco bought EMC. Although Cisco and EMC are close partners, EMCs subsidiary, VMware, has been threatening Cisco with a new technology called "software-defined networking," a new way to build networks using software and cheaper hardware. But Cisco is now in full competition mode with VMware. It spent about $1 billion to build a competing product, launched in December, and Chambers vowed to crush VMware's fledgling networking business and steal away all of its customers. Oracle's name was also floated as a possible buyer, but the company isn't interested, sources told Re/code. That's not at all surprising either. Oracle has been struggling for years to digest the last sprawling hardware company it bought, Sun Microsystems. Oracle is now focused on building a cloud business. So buying the world's biggest maker of storage hardware doesn't fit into that, even if it that purchase did include VMware, a significant player in the cloud world. HP reportedly wanted EMC mostly to lay its hands on VMware, and wanted to pay market price for EMC. But EMC wanted a premium price and the talks broke down from there, Re/code's Arik Hesseldahl reports. The deal between HP and EMC isn't completely dead, sources told Barron's. But we'll see.

Via Wikimedia CommonsHarvard's Widener Library.Harvard Management Company has named a new president and chief executive officer to head the university's investments, The Harvard Crimson reports. Incoming president and CEO Stephen Blyth is currently a HMC managing director and head of public markets, as well as a statistics professor at Harvard University. Starting on January 1, 2015, Blyth will be in charge of managing the university's endowment, which at $36.4 billion is the largest in the world. Harvard's press release notes that in Blyth's current role he is "responsible for investments in public equity, credit, and fixed-income markets, accounting for roughly 40% of the endowment and other assets that HMC invests through its hybrid model of internal and external management." HMC reported a 15.4% investment return for FY14 on Tuesday. While a .8% beat over internal projects, Harvard's returns were still outpaced by peer institutions such as MIT, Yale, and Dartmouth, which each saw returns over 19% for the year. According to The Crimson, "In his role as a professor, Blyth has taught Statistics 123: 'Applied Quantitative Finance,' a popular undergraduate course within the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, since 2009, and was awarded the Alpha Iota Prize for Excellence in Teaching in 2013." Before joining HMC in 2006, Blyth was Managing Director and head of the Global Rates proprietary trading group for Deutsche Bank's London office, according to his HMC biography. He will replace outgoing CEO Jane Mendillo, who announced her retirement in June after eight years leading the HMC. FREE AppDownload

While it continues to be known as a mecca for gamblers, visitors today are spending more money on hotels, restaurants and other businesses. Gaming has gone from 60% of revenue in 1970 to 37% of revenue in 2013. Here's an excerpt from a research note from Morgan Stanley: US regional gaming revenue experienced a period of 30 consecutive years of positive growth from 1979 to 2009 driven by the proliferation of casinos throughout the US. Even more impressive (and discussed in more detail in the section Impact of Supply Expansion in Las Vegas) is that the Las Vegas market continued to expand despite the introduction of new competition throughout the US ... In Fiscal Year 1970, Las Vegas Strip revenue was 60% gaming / 40% non-gaming. In F2013, the mix was 37% gaming / 63% non-gaming. The Las Vegas market has clearly shifted to be something else beyond just a casino market, driven by conventions, shows, hotel rooms,and savvy marketing.

Along with giving up the title of CEO, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison is also giving up a chunk of his enormous compensation. He'll get 750,000 fewer stock options, according to reports filed with the SEC. All told, Ellison will be granted 2.25 million shares as stock options in fiscal 2015. New co-CEOs Safra Catz and Mark Hurd will get a one-time option to buy an extra 500,000 shares. After activist investors complained about Ellison's huge salary in fiscal 2013 (which was not a great year for Oracle), Oracle's board in July announced they would cut his stock options. Instead of 7 million stock options, he would get 3 million. By giving up the CEO title, he's being reduced to 2.25 million. Keep in mind that Ellison is already Oracle's largest shareholder, with about a 25% stake. In July, the board also cut stock options to then-presidents Catz and Hurd. They went from 5 million shares to 2.5 million. So they've been raised to 2.75 million.  Instead of stock options, the board will offer stock tied to performance. By giving up the CEO title, Ellison will be eligible for fewer of those, too (562,500 instead of 750,000). Catz and Hurd will get a bump in the number of RSUs they can earn this year, to 687,500 apiece. Ellison has been one of the highest-paid executives for years, making him the fifth richest man in the world. In 2014, Oracle paid Catz and Hurd $37.7 million apiece and Ellison $67 million.

Daniel Goodman / Business InsiderA Bloomberg terminal.A group of financial firms led by Goldman Sachs are close to buying the instant-messaging startup Perzo Inc., according to a Wall Street Journal report. They might even announce the acquisition as early as next week. In total, 14 firms have joined together to find an alternative to Bloomberg's trader chat service.  Among the members are Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Jefferies, Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and others, according to the report. The messaging startup, Perzo, was founded by the former Microsoft and Skype executive David Gurle. That so many rival financial services companies have joined together to buy another messaging service is a strong indicator of the "discomfort some in the industry have with Bloomberg's grip on the messaging service." The Bloomberg terminals cost $20,000 a year, and banks are looking for cheaper alternatives — especially now that revenue has been "challenged" by low interest rates, according to the report. Michael Bloomberg certainly came back to helm his company at an interesting time. FREE AppDownload
ReutersStocks rallied on Wednesday, the first day of gains for the market in three days, with the Nasdaq leading percentage gains on Wednesday and the Dow adding more than 150 points. First, the scoreboard: And now, the top stories on Wednesday: 1. The latest report on new home sales showed sales rose a whopping 18% in August to an annualized pace of 504,000. This beat the 4.4% increase to a rate of 430,000 that was expected by Wall Street economists, and marked the largest beat relative to expectations for the reading since May 2010. Following the report, Michael Gapen said, "The three-month average pace of new home sales now stands at 450k, modestly above the Q2 average of 430k and the Q1 average of 431k. Inventories of new homes were broadly unchanged on the month at 203k, up 201k from last month. Against the August pace of sales, this left months’ supply at 4.8 months, down from 5.6 in June and July. Altogether, this is a much stronger report than expected and suggests housing demand has stabilized in recent quarters." 2. A report from Business Insider's Nicholas Carlson on Wednesday noted that 50% of Yahoo's outstanding shares, or about 500 million shares, have changed hands over the last four days, well above the average turnover of 8% over a four day period. Carlson unpacked a few theories as to what's behind this uptick in activity, including that Yahoo could be buying its own stock and that investors could be selling Yahoo stock to buy Alibaba. On Wednesday, Yahoo gained 2.1%, while shares of Alibaba gained 3.9%.  3. GoPro shares were up 7.6% on Wednesday, and the wearable camera company has now gained more than 170% since its IPO in June. 4. The US dollar has been rallying, which many argue is a negative for stocks and the economy, as it pressures the purchasing power of the US' international trading partners. But Goldman Sachs economist Jari Stehn wrote in a note to clients that under the firm's baseline scenario of the dollar gaining another 3%, the impact on inflation and growth is likely to be negligible.  5. Mark Dow of Behavioral Macro wrote a great summary of what's been going on in commodities market on Wednesday. Dow argued that recent weakness in commodities is just the first part of a two-part decline in the value of commodities that is likely to take shape as investors who piled into these assets during the 2004-2010 boom slowly get forced out.   6. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond shares gained more than 7.4% on Wednesday after the home goods retailer on Tuesday night reported earnings and sales that beat expectations. The company also gave a fiscal-year profit outlook that was in-line with expectations.  7. The euro continued to make new lows against the dollar, falling below $1.28 as the economic situation in the currency area continues to deteriorate. Earlier on Wednesday, the Germany's IFO business climate index fell from the prior month and missed expectations, and following that report Pantheon Macro's Claus Vistesen wrote that, "Weak growth in Eurozone trading partners, tensions with Ukraine and, possibly, a slowdown in China continue to weigh on the main German business survey index." 8. Tuesday night at sundown marks the beginning of Rosh Hashanah, the celebration of the Jewish New Year, and UBS' Art Cashin reminded us of one of the more obscure calendar-based trading rules on Wall Street: "Sell on Rosh Hashanah, and buy on Yom Kippur." Yom Kippur is set to begin at sundown on October 3.  Don't Miss: The Anatomy Of America's Finances In 10 Charts » FREE AppDownload
Wikimedia CommonsFA Insights is a daily newsletter from Business Insider that delivers the top news and commentary for financial advisors. It's The Baby Boomers — Not Millennials — Who Are Driving Stock-Market (Bloomberg) Everyone's always talking about the millennials, but so far "the Baby Boomers are still the ones really driving the bus in the stock market," Bank of America's Savita Subramanian argues. Although older people spend less, it's important to note what they are spending money on. As people age they stop spending money on discretionary items like cars, and costs like education and child care. Instead, the money is directed toward drugs and healthcare. And this year healthcare shares are up 16% this year on the S&amp;P 500, while companies that "rely on discretionary consumer spending are barely up 1 percent, the worst performance." Contrastingly, twenty years ago, health care stocks only made up 9% of the index. Saving Isn't The Most Important Thing For Financial Success (Pragmatic Capitalism) "Saving isn’t the key to financial success," Cullen Roche writes. "Investing is the key to financial success." "Investment (not the financial type you’re probably aware of with regard to buying stocks and bonds) is spending, not consumed, for future production," Roche adds. "When you invest in your future you build an intangible (or tangible) asset that (likely) makes you more valuable.  In other words, when you invest in yourself you make your future production more valuable which makes your future income more valuable which allows you to save more of your future income in the future.   Importantly, investing adds to aggregate saving because one does not dissave in order to spend on investment.  That is, when you invest you have an asset that is as valuable or more valuable than your prior savings PLUS someone else has your spending as their income." Stick With Buying Passive Funds For International Holdings (Financial Planning) Investors of actively managed funds or exchange-traded funds for their international holds aren't doing too well, and do better buying passive index funds, according to S&amp;P's SPIVA US Scorecard.  Over the past year 70% of global equity funds, 75% of international equity funds, 81% of international small-cap funds and 65% of emerging markets funds underperformed their benchmarks. Overall, active managers did "even worse over a three- or -five year period." “It gets worse over the longer term. Over the past three years, 65% of actively managed funds underperformed in the broad international category, and 61% underperformed in the emerging markets category, while over five years, 70% underperformed in the broad international fund category, and 68% of actively managed emerging markets funds underperformed their benchmarks," said Todd Rosenbluth, the S&amp;P's director of ETF and mutual fund research. However, all is not lost. Active management still did better in international small-cap. A Significant Twitter Following Does Not Reflect A Person's Credibility As A Wealth Manager (Wealth Management.com) A person's credibility as a wealth manager should not be evaluated by the number of twitter followers he has, argues Patricia Angus. "The correlation between the number of  “followers” and the quality of work is assumed to be high, despite little evidence to that effect," writes Angus. "I worry about families who are seeking good advice that’s based on education, training and experience.  With all this  “tweeting” going on, literally or figuratively, how can someone who doesn’t have the kind of filter that develops after years of experience know whether the advice he receives will be good?" she added. There's an assumption today "that by broadcasting the work you do, you're making the statement that the work has been done well." But that's not always the case. An Income Only Approach Is Great For "Peace Of Mind," But It Hasn't Been The Optimal Choice In Recent Years (Morningstar) The major benefit of the income only approach is "peace of mind," says Christine Benz. "Retirees take great comfort in knowing that if they are living off income distributions alone, they should never deplete their principal."  However, the income investment approach hasn't been the best choice in recent years because of low yields. Income-centric investors "have had a choice between two paths" in this situation. First, they could stay with high-quality securities and settle for ever-lower yields. This decision affects the standard of living because "they have been able to wring less out of their portfolios," Benz says. On the other hand, they could move into higher-yielding but also higher-risk securities, which is what many retirees have been doing. "That is why we have seen this stampede of assets into some higher-risk bond types over the past few years. We have seen pretty strong flows into high-yield emerging-markets bonds—this nontraditional bond category—all groups that have been seeing a greater level of interest in part because income-centric investors have been quite yield starved."

Note from dshort: The NYSE has released new data for margin debt, now available through August. I've updated the charts in this commentary to include the latest numbers. The New York Stock Exchange publishes end-of-month data for margin debt on the NYXdata website, where we can also find historical data back to 1959. Let's examine the numbers and study the relationship between margin debt and the market, using the S&amp;P 500 as the surrogate for the latter. The first chart shows the two series in real terms — adjusted for inflation to today's dollar using the Consumer Price Index as the deflator. I picked 1995 as an arbitrary start date. We were well into the Boomer Bull Market that began in 1982 and approaching the start of the Tech Bubble that shaped investor sentiment during the second half of the decade. The astonishing surge in leverage in late 1999 peaked in March 2000, the same month that the S&amp;P 500 hit its all-time daily high, although the highest monthly close for that year was five months later in August. A similar surge began in 2006, peaking in July 2007, three months before the market peak. Debt hit a trough in February 2009, a month before the March market bottom. It then began another major cycle of increase. Margin debt hit an all-time high in February of this year. The latest Margin Data Unfortunately, the NYSE margin debt data is about a month old when it is published. Following its February peak, real margin declined sharply for two months, -3.9% in March -3.2% in April and was flat in May. It then jumped 5.7% in June, its largest gain in 17 months. June saw a 0.9% decline, but the August number has drifted higher, up 0.6%, and is now only is 1.9% below the February peak.  Click for a larger image The next chart shows the percentage growth of the two data series from the same 1995 starting date, again based on real (inflation-adjusted) data. I've added markers to show the precise monthly values and added callouts to show the month. Margin debt grew at a rate comparable to the market from 1995 to late summer of 2000 before soaring into the stratosphere. The two synchronized in their rate of contraction in early 2001. But with recovery after the Tech Crash, margin debt gradually returned to a growth rate closer to its former self in the second half of the 1990s rather than the more restrained real growth of the S&amp;P 500. But by September of 2006, margin again went ballistic. It finally peaked in the summer of 2007, about three months before the market.  Click for a larger image After the market low of 2009, margin debt again went on a tear until the contraction in late spring of 2010. The summer doldrums promptly ended when Chairman Bernanke hinted of more quantitative easing in his August, 2010 Jackson Hole speech. The appetite for margin instantly returned, and the Fed periodically increased the easing until the beginning of tapering purchases now underway. NYSE Investor Credit Lance Roberts of STA Wealth Management analyzes margin debt in the larger context that includes free cash accounts and credit balances in margin accounts. Essentially, he calculates the Credit Balance as the sum of Free Credit Cash Accounts and Credit Balances in Margin Accounts minus Margin Debt. The chart below illustrates the mathematics of Credit Balance with an overlay of the S&amp;P 500. Note that the chart below is based on nominal data, not adjusted for inflation.  Click for a larger image Here's a slightly closer look at the data, starting with 1995. Also, I've inverted the S&amp;P 500 monthly closes and used markers to pinpoint the monthly close values.  Click for a larger image As I pointed out above, the NYSE margin debt data is a several weeks old when it is published. Thus, even though it may in theory be a leading indicator, a major shift in margin debt isn't immediately evident. Nevertheless, we see that the troughs in the monthly net credit balance preceded peaks in the monthly S&amp;P 500 closes by six months in 2000 and four months in 2007. The most recent S&amp;P 500 correction greater than 10% was the 19.39% selloff in 2011 from April 29th to October 3rd. Investor Credit hit a negative extreme in March 2011. There are too few peak/trough episodes in this overlay series to take the latest credit-balance data as a leading indicator of a major selloff in U.S. equities. But we'll definitely want to keep an eye on this metric in the months ahead. Note on the data: The NYSE website only posts the Free Credit Cash Accounts data back to 2003. The Free Credit Cash Accounts data back to 1980 is available on a fee basis from Haver Analytics. FREE AppDownload

Tesla and SpaceX are some of the most innovative companies today, making huge strides in the electric car and commercial spaceflight industries.  At the helm of both companies is CEO Elon Musk, the South African-born self-made billionaire. Musk has often been compared to the Tony Stark character as portrayed in the "Iron Man" movies. He knows how to have a good time when he's on top, and doesn't hold back when he's criticized. He's also the sexiest CEO in the world. Elon Musk is America's most badass CEO, and these photos prove it. Alex Davies contributed to this story.
Facebook/Four Seasons Resort Bora BoraThe average hotel in Bora Bora costs $855 per night. Traveling costs a lot of money, but the price of a trip can fluctuate tremendously depending on the destination. Hotels.com recently released its annual Hotels Price Index, a report on hotel prices in major destinations across the world that's based on Hotels.com bookings.  As part of this report, they found the destinations where U.S. travelers paid the most for hotel rooms—and some of the choices are surprising.  Instead of sleeping in notoriously expensive cities like Paris or London, Americans are spending more on hotel rates in places like Southampton, Bermuda and Moorea, French Polynesia. The most expensive destination on this list by far was Bora Bora in the French Polynesia, with an average price of $855 per night. FREE AppDownload
APA year ago, twins Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, who run Winklevoss Capital, gave a bullish presentation on Bitcoin at the Value Investing Congress.  They have just released the slides on the crypto-currency for the first time.  "On the day of our presentation the price of Bitcoin was $132.27. Yesterday at 4pm EDT the price was $432.26. I generally don’t like to talk about price too much....Most days I don’t check it at all, but in the context of this presentation and using the granularity of a year, I think it’s a reasonably worthy exercise. Rome wasn’t built in a day, and Bitcoin won’t be either, but I still feel very bullish about its long-term value both as a technology and an investment," Cameron Winklevoss writes. FREE AppDownload
Kevin Wolf/APNEW YORK/BOSTON (Reuters) - Your medical information is worth 10 times more than your credit card number on the black market. Last month, the FBI warned healthcare providers to guard against cyber attacks after one of the largest U.S. hospital operators, Community Health Systems Inc, said Chinese hackers had broken into its computer network and stolen the personal information of 4.5 million patients. Security experts say cyber criminals are increasingly targeting the $3 trillion U.S. healthcare industry, which has many companies still reliant on aging computer systems that do not use the latest security features. "As attackers discover new methods to make money, the healthcare industry is becoming a much riper target because of the ability to sell large batches of personal data for profit," said Dave Kennedy, an expert on healthcare security and CEO of TrustedSEC LLC. "Hospitals have low security, so it's relatively easy for these hackers to get a large amount of personal data for medical fraud." Interviews with nearly a dozen healthcare executives, cybersecurity investigators and fraud experts provide a detailed account of the underground market for stolen patient data. The data for sale includes names, birth dates, policy numbers, diagnosis codes and billing information. Fraudsters use this data to create fake IDs to buy medical equipment or drugs that can be resold, or they combine a patient number with a false provider number and file made-up claims with insurers, according to experts who have investigated cyber attacks on healthcare organizations. Medical identity theft is often not immediately identified by a patient or their provider, giving criminals years to milk such credentials. That makes medical data more valuable than credit cards, which tend to be quickly canceled by banks once fraud is detected. Stolen health credentials can go for $10 each, about 10 or 20 times the value of a U.S. credit card number, according to Don Jackson, director of threat intelligence at PhishLabs, a cyber crime protection company. He obtained the data by monitoring underground exchanges where hackers sell the information. The percentage of healthcare organizations that have reported a criminal cyber attack has risen to 40 percent in 2013 from 20 percent in 2009, according to an annual survey by the Ponemon Institute think tank on data protection policy. Founder Larry Ponemon, who is privy to details of attacks on healthcare firms that have not been made public, said he has seen an increase this year in both the number of cyber attacks and number of records stolen in those breaches.      Fueling that increase is a shift to electronic medical records by a majority of U.S. healthcare providers. Marc Probst, chief information officer of Intermountain Healthcare in Salt Lake City, said his hospital system fends off thousands of attempts to penetrate its network each week. So far it is not aware of a successful attack. "The only reason to buy that data is so they can fraudulently bill," Probst said. Healthcare providers and insurers must publicly disclose data breaches affecting more than 500 people, but there are no laws requiring criminal prosecution. As a result, the total cost of cyber attacks on the healthcare system is difficult to pin down. Insurance industry experts say they are one of many expenses ultimately passed onto Americans as part of rising health insurance premiums. Consumers sometimes discover their credentials have been stolen only after fraudsters use their personal medical ID to impersonate them and obtain health services. When the unpaid bills are sent on to debt collectors, they track down the fraud victims and seek payment.      Ponemon cited a case last year in which one patient learned that his records at a major hospital chain were compromised after he started receiving bills related to a heart procedure he had not undergone. The man's credentials were also used to buy a mobility scooter and several pieces of medical equipment, racking up tens of thousands of dollars in total fraud. The government's efforts to combat Medicare fraud have focused on traditional types of scams that involve provider billing and over billing. Fraud involving the Medicare program for seniors and the disabled totaled more than $6 billion in the last two years, according to a database maintained by Medical Identity Fraud Alliance. "Healthcare providers and hospitals are just some of the easiest networks to break into," said Jeff Horne, vice president at cybersecurity firm Accuvant, which is majority-owned by private equity firm Blackstone Group. "When I've looked at hospitals, and when I've talked to other people inside of a breach, they are using very old legacy systems - Windows systems that are 10 plus years old that have not seen a patch." KPMG partner Michael Ebert said security has been an afterthought for many medical providers - whether it is building encryption into software used to create electronic patient records or in setting budgets. "Are you going to put money into a brand new MRI machine or laser surgery or are you going to put money into a new firewall?" he said.

Zoolander, screenshotHere's the thing about fashion, it's not always wearable. What appears on the runway is not appealing on the street, or in any guys closet for that matter. But that doesn't mean that there aren't a few cool trends any guy could pick up from each season — or ways to wear them without feeling like Zoolander. Business Insider caught up with a few of our friends in the world of menswear to ask how they're incorporating trends they see from more runway-focused designers into their every day wardrobes... subtly. "You can see things that are inspiring on the street or on the run way show and integrate them in a way that's not completely in your face," said Mark Bollman, founder of Boston-based  retailer Ball and Buck.  Ball and BuckFrom Ball and Buck: The Striped Oxford Hunters Shirt, Ocean The Perfect Keychain, Lobster hook- Natural The Suede Boat Shoe, Mushroom The Upland Hat Pelican Hook Belt, Tan The 6-point Twill Pant, NavyBall and Buck is a sportier brand that mixes classic and outdoor elements with modern style. Bollman recommends taking trends and subbing them in for one or two core pieces in your outfit. Take two trends that were all over the runways this spring as an example, stripes and neon. "Neons and other bright colors that are typically reserved for the gym have spread into the everyday wardrobe like wildfire," said Bollman. "As a brand with sporting roots we like to show our sporty side by throwing our signature blaze orange upland hat on top of almost any outfit we wear. It gives a little pop of masculinity without putting off the yoga vibe. It will also protect you if you ever find yourself on the hunting field with our old Vice President." Or — if you don't have any hunting dates with Dick Cheney scheduled any time soon — you could try throwing a pair of brightly colored socks under your suit for a pop of color.  As for stripes, on the runway they're wide railroad/jail-stripes. If that doesn't make you comfortable, go for a thinner, classic Oxford stripe.  "It's about saying, would I feel comfortable wearing this in 3 years," said Bollman. In the world of men's shoes, it's all about boots and suede, says Justin Jeffers, blogger at The Fine Young Gentleman and founder of shoe and accessory line, Jay Butler. Military coats and quilted jackets — the preppy staple — are also in full effect this season. You may want to consider getting any of those items in green. "Yes, a color can be a trend. This coming season that color is green. You will see it in a variety of shades from hunter green to the ever present olive drab of military wear," said Jeffers. Jay ButlerJay Butler duffel bagAs for what guys are carrying, Jeffers says that bags are getting boxier — "a bit more voluminous; more masculine, some might argue." There are also a couple trends that you should have no problem handling, like rain coats and chunky knit scarves. You may want to be more careful with fur accents (like around the hood of your jacket) and patterns (like checks and florals). That's if you're even willing to go in that direction.  "It all depends on how much attention you want to get," said Bollman. FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersChicago Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Evans speaks during the Sasin Bangkok ForumWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve should be "exceptionally patient" in removing monetary policy accommodation, a top Fed official said on Wednesday, even if doing so means allowing inflation to modestly overshoot the central bank's 2 percent goal. "I am very uncomfortable with calls to raise our policy rate sooner than later," Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Evans said at a Peterson Institute conference on labor market slack. "I favor delaying liftoff until I am more certain that we have sufficient momentum in place toward our policy goals." The biggest risk the Fed faces is choking off the economic recovery by prematurely raising rates, he said. Rate rises, when they do come, should be "relatively shallow for some time" so as to give the Fed time to assess the ability of the economy to withstand tighter monetary policy conditions. Evans' aggressively dovish comments, coming as the Fed prepares to wind down its bond-buying stimulus next month, underscores the battle that is taking place behind the scenes on the Fed's policy-setting panel. The Fed has kept interest rates near zero since December 2008. Most Fed officials agree that rates should start to rise next year, but exactly when is a point of sharp debate, with St. Louis Fed President James Bullard calling for a March increase, and others urging a later liftoff. Evans, though he won't have a vote on the Fed's policy-setting panel until 2015, has been an influential voice at the central bank. Evans said he expects the economy to reach full employment before inflation is clearly headed back to 2 percent. Most Fed officials expect unemployment, now at 6.1 percent, to reach its long-run 5.2 percent to 5.5 percent range by the end of 2016. The difficulties that Europe and Japan have faced fighting falling inflation and outright deflation show, he said, that the Fed needs to "proceed cautiously" on rate increases. "The decision to lift the funds rate from zero should be made only when we have a great deal of confidence that growth has enough momentum to reach full employment and that inflation will return sustainably to 2 percent," he said, adding that he sees a good deal of slack in the labor market. Additionally, he argued, a surge in inflation is "not at all very likely." A modest and temporary rise in inflation, however, would be manageable, he suggested. Given that inflation has hung below the Fed's 2 percent target for years, he said, "(o)ne could imagine moderately-above-target inflation for a limited period of time as simply the flip side of our recent inflation experience — and hardly an event that would impose great costs on the economy."   (Writing by Ann Saphir; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama) FREE AppDownload
AP What’s the difference between you and Dr. Dre? About $620 million. That’s the amount the rapper-producer-entrepreneur earned before taxes in 2014, according to Forbes, which crowned Dr. Dre the "Hip-Hop Cash King." His earnings represent the highest annual total for any entertainer ever evaluated by Forbes. In fact, that figure is more than the combined earnings of everyone else on Forbes’ annual Hip-Hop Cash Kings list, which includes P Diddy and Jay Z, tied at the No. 2 spot ($60 million); Drake at No. 4 ($33 million); and DJ Khaled at No. 20 ($7 million). At one time, Death Row was the label that paid him; but most of Dr. Dre's recent earnings came from the $3 billion sale of Beats Electronics to Apple this past May. Cofounded by Dre and music exec Jerry Iovine, Beats features premium sound equipment like logo-embossed headphones and speakers as well as software and a streaming-music subscription service, and it was described as “not just a product but a category” by Forbes.  Dr. Dre first rose to fame as cofounder of the influential gangster rap group N.W.A in 1986 and then Death Row Records in 1991, where he produced rappers including the late Tupac Shakur, MC Hammer, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, and 50 Cent. (He stepped down in 1996.) Dr. Dre has also won a few Grammies, continued producing, and even acted in films like “Set It Off” and “Training Day.” Though Dr. Dre called himself hip-hop’s first billionaire shortly after the Beats deal, Forbes says a “nine-figure tax bill means that won’t happen immediately,” but it couldn’t be too far off. In any event, it doesn’t seem like anyone will be forgetting about Dre anytime soon. FREE AppDownload
172%! That's how much GoPro shares have risen since the stock made its debut on June 26, according to Bespoke Investment Group.  Excluding a couple brief pauses, the stock has gone basically straight up, from $28.65 on June 26 to more than $78.50 in afternoon trade on Wednesday. Since going public, GoPro has had just one quarterly report since going public, reporting adjusted earnings and revenue that topped expectations, but the stock fell about 13% after that report.  The post-earnings decline is basically the worst thing to happen to the stock in the last three months, and after that fall the stock has made it all that back and then some. At current prices, the company's market cap is nearly $10 billion. Here's the incredible chart of GoPro since making its debut. Google Finance FREE AppDownload
Along with his new title as CTO, Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison's tremendous pay package is also trending down. In fiscal 2014, the former CEO earned $67.3 million, mostly in stock options, according to forms filed with the SEC. Specifics are: $1 in salary, $741,384 in "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation," which most people would call a bonus, nearly $65 million in stock options, and over $1.5 million in perks. That's quite a bit less from 2013, when he was paid $78.4 million, mostly in stock options. And far lower than the year before, $96.2 million. When his 2013 pay was a revealed, activist investor group CtW Investments balked and lobbied the board to stop throwing so many stock options at him. Top proxy adviser firm Institutional Shareholder Services agreed with CtW and recommended that shareholders vote against Oracle pay packages.  Oracle's board argued back that Oracle is an unbelievably profitable company and Ellison was its kingpin. However, Ellison did try and appease them. He turn down his $1.2 million cash bonus for fiscal 2013. Despite another pay cut, Ellison is not in danger of landing in the poor house. He's Oracle's biggest shareholder, with a 25% stake, owns vast holdings in real estate and other businesses, and is the world's fifth-richest person, worth about $49 billion, reports Forbes.  New co-CEOs Mark Hurd and Safra Catz also had a pay cut in 2014 to $37.7 million apiece. They were paid $44 million each in 2013, mostly in stock options.  The SEC forms included a bunch of fun details on perks for these top execs, too. FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersCEO of AIG Robert Benmosche speaks during an interview with Reuters in the garden of his Adriatic sea-front villa in Dubrovnik(Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc  isn't AIG's biggest competitor and AIG handles all its rivals in a very effective way, former AIG  Chief Executive Robert Benmosche told Bloomberg TV. "I think his last ten years is not as good as his first 20 years - but...when you get big it's hard to continue to grow," said Benmosche, who currently serves as an adviser to the insurer. (http://bloom.bg/1sXDBie) The AIG-Berkshire rivalry heated up last year when AIG decided to stop signing new reinsurance contracts with Berkshire due to competitive reasons. The decision came after Berkshire poached senior AIG executives, and Buffett said he planned to expand his company's commercial insurance operations that compete with AIG. Benmosche, who was diagnosed with cancer in 2010, sped up his exit from AIG after he learnt in May that he had nine months to a year to live.

Earnings and expectations for future earnings are what drive stock prices in the long run. The premium investors pay for those earnings, however, fluctuate over time throughout stock market and profits cycles. And that premium is commonly measured by the price-earnings ratio. In a new research note, Fundstrat Global Advisors' Tom Lee illustrates how price-earnings ratios move during long bull markets. Specifically, he does so by taking the ratio of the price divided by the peak earnings level of the cycle. The chart may not be immediately intuitive for most people as it reflects a moving price (P) and a static peak level of earnings (E). It does, however, do a decent job of showing how high P/Es will get and how long it takes for stocks to get to that peak. Lee believes the historical patterns provide a precedent for what could be many more years of gains in the stock market. Arguably one of the more aggressive bulls on Wall Street, Lee sees S&amp;P 500 earnings peaking at $154 from the $118 level we're at today. "In Figure 4 below we have plotted the current bull market P/E using our implied peak earnings of $154 against the prior long lived bull markets," Lee writes. "The S&amp;P 500 is currently 12.9x ($154 peak) and prior bulls peaked at an average of 17x. If we apply the 17x average to our $154 estimated peak earnings we get a peak S&amp;P 500 value of 2600 at just the “average”." Keep in mind that Lee's $154 is a forecast.

University of Salford Press OfficeThe last time I taught college-level money and banking, over five years ago, the textbook I was coerced into assigning (but didn’t use) still had a section on the mechanics of how the banking system in a fractional-reserve regime could expand deposits (a component of “money”) by some multiple of cash reserves provided by the central bank. The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, one of my former employers, had published a booklet, "Modern Money Mechanics," that explained how this process played out. When I was at the Chicago Fed, this was one of the Bank’s “bestsellers.” In my undergraduate money and banking class, there were several questions on the final exam that pertained to the mechanics of this seemingly “magical” deposit-expansion process. I would be willing to wager that to this day, there still are questions on most money and banking final exams related to the mechanical process of deposit expansion in the banking system. It is a money and banking class rite of passage. Although the money multiplier is a convenient pedagogical tool, I suspect that the underlying economic significance of it is neglected in most classrooms. And that underlying economic significance is that the banking system in a fractional-reserve regime can, along with the central bank, create credit figuratively out of thin air. All kinds of credit, thin-air or not, enable their recipients to increase their current spending on something. But only thin-air credit unambiguously does not require anyone else to simultaneously decrease his/her current spending. Thus, a net increase in the supply of thin-air credit carries the strong presumption that there will be a net increase in total spending in the economy. Now, for those of you who took a money and banking class, let’s review the essence of the money multiplier. For those of you who have not taken the class, let’s catch up. Suppose that there are n separate banks in the banking system, where n is a very large number. Now suppose that the central bank purchases $100 of securities from State Pension Fund that banks at Bank 1. State Pension Fund’s deposits at Bank 1 have increased by $100. Bank 1’s reserve account at the central bank has increased by $100.  MegaCorp, who is financing some new capital equipment to be purchased from CoreCapGoods sells some new bonds in an amount of $100 to State Pension Fund. MegaCorp and CoreCapGoods both, coincidentally, bank at Bank 1. Let’s stop here to consider what has happened to thin-air credit. The central bank purchased $100 of securities from State Pension Fund, paying for these securities with funds created out of thin air. State Pension Fund then used these thin-air funds to purchase $100 of new bonds issued by MegaCorp to finance its new capital equipment purchase. $100 of new thin-air credit has been created by the central bank. Bank 1’s deposits increased by a net $100, owned first by State Pension Fund, then transferred to MegaCorp and then transferred to CoreCapGoods. Back to the money multiplier. Assume that by law, banks are required to hold as cash reserves at the central bank an amount equal to 10% of the deposits on their books. Further assume for simplicity’s sake, that banks earn no interest on their cash reserves held at the central bank. So, Bank 1 has an additional $100 of cash reserves at the central bank, but because its deposits went up by only $100, Bank 1 is required to hold only $10 more of reserves at the central bank. Bank 1 has an additional $90 of reserves at the central bank that are in excess of what it is required to hold and earn no interest. Now assume that Local Auto Dealer comes into Bank 1 in hopes of getting a loan for $90 to finance its inventory. Because Bank 1 has the capital to support new loans and the loan terms are attractive to both parties, Local Auto Dealer gets its loan, promptly writing a check payable on its account at Bank 1 to Detroit Motor Vehicles, which banks at Bank 2. The issuance of the $90 loan by Bank 1 increases thin-air credit by an additional $90. In total, thin-air credit has increased a net $190 up at this point. Bank 2 now finds its deposits up by $90 and its reserves at the central bank up by $90. But Bank 2 is required to hold only an additional $9 of reserves at the central bank (10% of the $90 in new deposits), so Bank 2 has $81 dollars in reserves in excess of what it is required to hold at the central bank. It just so happens that VentureCap walks into Bank 2 seeking a loan for $81 to fund the start-up of AppNoOneNeeds. Bank 2 has the capital to support new loans and the loan terms are agreeable to both parties, so VentureCap gets its loan of $81.The issuance of the $81 loan by Bank 2 increases thin-air credit by an additional $81. In total, thin-air credit has increased a net $271 at this point. AppNoOneNeeds deposits its $81 in start-up funds at its bank, Bank 3. With those $81 in deposits, Bank 3 also receives $81 in reserves at the central bank, of which, it only is required to hold $8.10 (10% of $81). And so on. At the limit of n banks, the initial $100 of reserves created by the central bank in its purchase of securities from State Pension Fund, will have been “multiplied” into $1,000 of new deposits in the banking system ($100/10%), $900 of thin-air credit created by the banking system and $100 of thin-air credit created by the central bank (or a net increase in total thin-air credit of $1,000). There are all kinds of real-world complications that can reduce or increase the size of the deposit and thin-air credit multiplier — complications upon which money and banking final exam questions are famous. Recipients of deposits may not want to redeposit the entire amount, preferring to hold a portion as folding money, i.e., currency. An increase in currency held by the public is a drain on bank cash reserves that lowers the value of the multiplier. In real life in the U.S., only checkable bank deposits are subject to reserve requirements. So, if an entity receives a deposit from some other entity and chooses to hold the funds as a deposit not subject to reserve requirements, the magnitude of the deposit/thin-air-credit multiplier will be increased. Even when banks are not paid any interest on reserves held at the central bank above and beyond what they are required to hold, some banks still desire to hold some “excess” reserves. To the degree that more excess reserves are desired, the magnitude of the deposit/thin-air-credit multiplier will be reduced. More importantly, in the real world, banks do not behave according to this mechanical deposit/credit multiplier process although the end result of their behavior may be approximated by it. Banks don’t sit around waiting for deposits and reserves to come to them if they have good lending prospects. If a bank is approached for a loan it wishes to make, it does not tell the prospective borrower to come back tomorrow when it might have more funds to lend. Rather, the bank funds the loan by purchasing the necessary funds in some interbank market. Moreover, if banks are constrained by capital adequacy, which they were in the last financial crisis, they cannot support new loan growth even if they have a surfeit of central bank reserves. And, because banks’ required reserves are based on their deposit levels in some previous week, the deposit/bank-credit multiplier is not at all constrained by required reserves in the current week (right, Bob Laurent?). But I digress. The point I am trying to make is that many money and banking professors spend too much time teaching their students the mechanics of the bank-deposit/bank-credit multiplier and not enough time explaining to them the important economic implication of the result of that multiplier — the banking system’s ability to create credit figuratively out of thin air. To illustrate the economic significance of thin-air credit vs. all other credit, consider Charts 1 and 2. Plotted in both charts are the year-over-year percent changes in nominal Gross Domestic Purchases (Gross Domestic Product + Imports – Exports) from Q2:1953 through Q2:2007. Plotted in Chart 1 are the year-over-year percent changes in the sum of U.S. depository institution (commercial banks, S&amp;Ls and credit unions) credit and Fed credit from Q1:1953 through Q1:2007. This credit sum is a variation of the thin-air credit to which I have referred. Thin-air credit growth has been advanced by one quarter to illustrate the effect of its growth this quarter on Gross Domestic Purchases growth next quarter. The correlation coefficient between thin-air credit growth advanced one quarter vs. Gross Domestic Purchases growth during this period is 0.61 out of a maximum possible 1.00. Plotted in Chart 2 are year-over-year percent changes in total U.S. credit outstanding excluding thin-air credit. This credit aggregate also is advanced by one quarter. The correlation coefficient between non-thin-air credit growth advanced one quarter vs. Gross Domestic Purchases growth is 0.29, less than half that of the correlation with thin-air credit growth. The Econtrarian The Econtrarian So, here is my plea to money and banking professors. Spend less time teaching the mechanics of the deposit/bank-credit multiplier. Rather, spend more time explaining how this process creates credit figuratively out of thin air and why thin-air credit creation has such an important effect on the business cycle. Who knows? Perhaps one of your students will become a Fed official and can then explain this concept to her Fed colleagues. FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Jason CohnYale wins.BOSTON (Reuters) - Yale University's endowment posted a 20.2 percent return in the 2014 fiscal year, the school said on Wednesday, besting Ivy League rivals such as Harvard and Dartmouth. The endowment value grew to $23.9 billion as of June 30, from $20.8 billion the year before, bolstered by double-digit returns in private equity, domestic and foreign stocks, and real estate, it said in a press release. Its hedge fund investments returned 9 percent, it said. The Connecticut-based university said it would maintain 20 percent of its portfolio in hedge funds and 31 percent in private equity during 2015, with real estate and equities making up most of the rest. Harvard University's endowment, the largest school endowment in the world at over $34 billion, announced on Tuesday an investment return of 15.4 percent. Much smaller endowments at Dartmouth College and University of Pennsylvania gained 19.2 percent and 17.5 percent, respectively.

Thomson ReutersMichael Lucarelli leaves the federal court building after posting bail in the Manhattan borough of New YorkA former executive at a New York investor relations firm, whose barefoot dash from news photographers last month caught the attention of Comedy Central's The Daily Show, pleaded guilty on Wednesday to insider trading. Michael Lucarelli, the former director of market intelligence at Lippert/Heilshorn &amp; Associates, pleaded guilty in Manhattan federal court to one count of securities fraud on his 52nd birthday. He faces up to 20 years in prison at his sentencing in January. He was originally charged with 13 counts of securities fraud, after federal prosecutors said he used material nonpublic information gleaned from LHA documents to trade in companies that were clients of the firm from 2013 to 2014. In August, following his arrest and initial court appearance, Lucarelli fled from news photographers in a sleeveless undershirt, leaving his sandals behind in his haste. His all-out sprint was captured by CNBC and the video clip was later featured on an episode of The Daily Show. He wore a suit and dress shoes on Wednesday and did not flinch when photographers approached him outside. Lucarelli told U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman that he would use drafts of press releases he obtained through LHA to buy shares in certain companies, selling his stock after the announcements were made public. Federal agents approached LHA in July and asked the firm not to fire Lucarelli so the investigation could proceed, Keith Lippert, a founder of the firm, told Reuters last month. Investigators obtained a search warrant for Lucarelli's office and found a draft press release from TREX Co Inc in his locked briefcase, according to the initial criminal complaint. They left the document there to avoid alerting him. During the following week, one of Lucarelli's brokerage accounts bought more than 37,000 shares of TREX, according to the complaint. The stock was sold on Aug. 4, the date the press release was made public, for a profit of nearly $90,000, prosecutors said. Lucarelli said his behavior was influenced in part by his use of pain medication for a chronic disease as well as anger at LHA for what he said was a failure to pay him what he was owed. "None of this excuses my gambling addiction to day trading," Lucarelli said, crying. Lippert did not immediately comment on Wednesday. Along with TREX, Lucarelli admitted trading illegally in FAB Universal Corp, PhotoMedex Inc, Pacific Ethanol Inc, Dot Hill Systems Corp, Lifetime Brands Inc and LCA-Vision Inc. He also agreed to forfeit nearly $1 million to the government. Lucarelli still faces a parallel civil lawsuit brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The case is the latest in a series of insider trading cases brought by Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, whose office has convicted more than 80 individuals since October 2009.     (Reporting by Joseph Ax; Editing by Tom Brown) FREE AppDownload

Commodities have been getting crushed. Here's a five-year chart of the PowerShares Broad Commodities ETF, which has been in a clear downtrend since peaking in 2011 and appears to be heading even lower. Yahoo Finance Mark Dow, one of our favorite market watchers, is out with a new post on his Tumblr page titled "Of Trends, Yields, and Metals" that addresses the recent meltdown in commodities and the sneaky rise in short-term Treasuries.  Dow writes that commodities overhyped from 2004 to 2011, and coming back from this trade has been a long, slow, and for many investors, painful, process.  Dow:  Specifically these days, I think about Chinese financial liquidation. We know there was a boom in China. We know there was a boom in commodities. And we know Chinese entities were stockpiling commodities and in many cases pledging them as collateral. They are now unwinding. They are not alone, but they’re the most salient example. My fundamental view is that commodities got overhyped and over loved over the 2004-2011 period and we’re going through a long period of mean reversion. Initially, the hype was based on emerging market economies plugging into the grid and consultants convincing slower money that it was its own asset class and a great diversifier. The second phase of the ramp came from misunderstanding QE. Now, however, we’re in the down cycle. We saw the first leg of the great commodity unwind and the second one may be upon us. The first shakeout was mostly tourist dollars getting shaken out of the gold tree. Many of the investors who bought gold as protection against QE-induced inflation were forced out over 2011-2013, as it became clear they got it wrong. The second phase, will come as higher real rates drive the wooden stake the rest of the way through, shaking out the long term money, the asset allocators and the true believers. And based on the charts above, if this is not happening now, it is likely to happen very soon. Recently, we've highlighted the decline in silver, corn, soybeans, and even oil.  Each of these commodities, of course, has specific reasons behind the weakness, but the broader reality is that as an asset class, commodities have been getting crushed, and Dow doesn't see an end quite in sight. "Again, there’s a chance that this is a big head fake and not a new trend," Dow writes. "But managing money is about pressing your bets when the odds are in your favor ... Simple money management only gives you two choices here: be short, or get the hell out of the way."

Thomson ReutersMester, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, attends the Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium in Jackson HoleCLEVELAND (Reuters) - Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta Mester said she thinks the Fed should overhaul how it communicates its policy guidance, perhaps tying its statements about monetary policy to forecasts about economic performance. In remarks here on Wednesday she said that as the Fed ends its crisis-era policies it should also move away from the type of qualitative forward guidance it has used in recent years to statements that are more directly tied to economic projections. While short of a formal monetary policy rule, Mester said such a system would give the public, investors and others a clearer sense of where monetary policy is heading based on economic performance. "I would like to see the forward guidance evolve over time to give more information about the conditions we systematically assess in calibrating the stance of policy to the economy's actual progress and anticipated progress," Mester said. Her comments come amid a broad review of Fed communications strategy led by Vice-Chair Stanley Fischer and a more immediate debate over how to change the current policy statement to pave the way for upcoming interest rate hikes and phase out language rooted in the economic crisis. Mester repeated an earlier critique - that she felt it was time for the Fed to drop as a key standing phrase that it would be a "considerable time," once a Fed bondbuying program ends this fall, before interest rates are increased. The phrase "tends to focus the public's attention on a calendar time for liftoff rather than the changes in economic conditions that will help determine changes in appropriate policy," she said. Mester, who currently votes on the Fed's main policy setting committee, did not dissent at the recent Fed meeting, and the language in the statement was left virtually untouched. The bondbuying program is set to end in October, and many analysts feel the phrase will almost certainly need to be dropped or at least modified at that point since the program it refers to will no longer exist. Whatever language emerges, the October session may be seen as the start of a countdown to the Fed's "liftoff" of interest rates, expected around the middle of next year. Mester did not indicate when she feels rates should increase. But she did say her economic projections are on the more optimistic side, with growth projected at 3 percent for the next two years, and unemployment expected to reach what she regards as a normal level of 5.5 percent by the end of 2015.   (Reporting By Howard Schneider; Editing by Andrea Ricci) FREE AppDownload
Mike Lawrie/NikeNike CEO Mark Parker Nike (NKE) is set to report earnings for its first fiscal quarter of 2015 after the closing bell on Thursday September 25. The athletic wear giant is trading near all time highs and continuing to charge forward on strong revenue in North America and booming popularity in South America and emerging markets. Estimize (Graph above from ChartIQ Visual Earnings) On Thursday analysts expect Nike to report another robust quarter. Contributing analysts on Estimize are forecasting that profits will be up 6% on a year over year basis while revenues increase by 12%. If the Estimize community’s prediction comes true Nike will have accelerated its growth on both the top and bottom line compared to last quarter. Riding on the World Cup Soccer equipment and apparel is an area of expected growth for a second straight quarter. The final stages of the FIFA World Cup carried over into Nike’s first fiscal quarter of 2015 and there should be a residual effect from Nike’s heavy advertising in the Spring. Although Adidas was the official sponsor of the World Cup, that didn’t stop Nike and Under Armour (UA) from launching aggressive marketing campaigns featuring the players they sponsor. Nike is hoping that its promotional efforts will boost sales in South America and may cut into Adidas’ market share in Europe. Margins and Share Buybacks Expanding margins and a share repurchasing program are working in unison to boostNike’s earnings per share. Last quarter Nike reported a 1.7% increase in gross margins due to more frequent direct to consumer purchases (higher margin transactions) and a higher average sales price.  Additionally Nike repurchased 12.3 million shares throughout the quarter as part of its 4 year share buyback repurchasing plan. The program still has a couple years to go but at the end of last quarter 51.9 million shares had been repurchased for approximately $3.4 billion in cash. Forces working against Nike’s bottom line include higher input costs and unfavorably exchange rates due to a strong US dollar. Sales by Region In Nike’s 4th fiscal quarter of 2014 North American sales made up 44.4% of Nike’s total revenue. By increasing its footprint in South America and Europe Nike could see that figure fall slightly. Sales in North America increased by 10% on a year over year basis last quarter, but Nike’s most flourishing region was ‘emerging markets’ which includes South America, but not China. Nike revenue’s rose by 25% in emerging markets last quarter excluding currency exchanges. Converting emerging market currencies back to US dollars adversely impacted Nike’s bottom line, lowering the net change in emerging market sales from 25% to just 9%. Nike’s total sales were up 11%, and Asia was Nike’s most troublesome region. Revenue in Japan was flat and sales grew just 2% in China, a market where Nike has much more room to expand. Nike’s brand is relatively weak in Greater China, there Nike only did $702 million in business last quarter. China could be the key to Nike’s growth in the future and the athletic wear company will need to do much better there in coming years. The Chinese citizenry represents approximately 19% of the World’s population, but Nike’s sales there make up just 9.5% of the company’s total revenue. The rising consumer class in China is a huge opportunity that Nike ought to target aggressively in the near future. Contributing analysts on Estimize are setting the bar high for Nike on Thursday. Nike’s earnings per share have been increasing by 3% to 4% over the past 3 quarters, but this quarter the Estimize community expects that rate to jump to 6%. Direct to consumer sales and strong pricing power are likely to drive profits this quarter despite the strong US dollar. Nike’s already a massive company but traders and analysts on Estimize agree that there’s plenty of opportunity ahead. FREE AppDownload
JD LasicaMarissa Mayer is suddenly working for new owners.Yahoo has new owners. Or at least half new.  Fifty percent of Yahoo shares have changed hands over the past four days. Ironfire Capital fund manager Eric Jackson says that Yahoo's average ownership turnover over four days is closer to 8%. Here are some theories as to what's going on: Yahoo is probably buying a bunch of its own stock. Yahoo had a big stake in Alibaba, selling 121 million shares during its Friday IPO. Yahoo management promised that it would use half the after-tax proceeds to buy back Yahoo shares. That would account for ~$3 billion of the $20 billion changing hands. People are probably selling Yahoo and buying Alibaba. For a long time, Yahoo stock was going up because owning it was just about the only way you could gain exposure to Alibaba. But now Alibaba is a public company. So people who owned Yahoo for Alibaba are probably now selling it and buying Alibaba. Yahoo is a juicy acquisition target. It has a ton of cash and owns big chunks of two Asian companies: Alibaba and Yahoo Japan. If you add up the value of that cash and those stakes, the number is actually bigger than Yahoo's market cap. That means Yahoo's core business, which generates nearly $5 billion in revenues every year and nearly $1 billion in profit, is being valued at close to $0 by the market. It's likely that some arbitrage fund managers are buying into Yahoo, hoping some kind of transaction goes down. Value investors believe that Yahoo is undervalued and want to bet on Marissa Mayer. It's possible that some value investors are looking at Yahoo's sum-of-the-parts valuation, seeing how little the market values the core, and buying Yahoo stock because they believe CEO Marissa Mayer will soon have the company growing again. Truthfully, all she has to do is get revenue growing again, and the market will probably apply the same multiples to Yahoo as it does to Microsoft and AOL — two other tech companies in turnaround. Right now, that would mean a boost in Yahoo's stock price. Maybe some people with money are betting that Mayer can clear a really low bar.  Yahoo is a juicy acquisition target, part two. If one of the two companies that Yahoo owns big stakes of, Alibaba or Yahoo Japan, were to buy Yahoo, they would be able to realize the full value of Yahoo's stake in themselves without having to pay taxes on it. That's another reason arbitrage investors might be buying in. Some activist could be building a stake. There is an argument to be made that Marissa Mayer is doing a poor job managing Yahoo. She could cut costs by slashing headcount. She could outsource its display business to Google. Maybe there is an activist out there who thinks the market would give Yahoo's core business a greater valuation if he or she could buy a bunch of Yahoo stock and force Mayer to make a few quick changes. If anything really dramatic is happening, we'll know soon, because you can't buy more than 5% of a public company without disclosing it.

Marko Djurica/ReutersWomen stand near an area that was recently shelled in Donetsk, eastern Ukraine, September 16, 2014. A selloff on Ukraine's dollar debt is focusing attention on a controversial $3 billion bond held by Russia, raising investor concerns that President Vladimir Putin could use the issue to trigger a cascade of defaults across Kiev's sovereign Eurobonds. The so-called bail-bond, taken out late last year by former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich, carries a clause which - given Kiev's steadily worsening finances - may enable the Kremlin to demand immediate repayment. At best, that could force Western lenders to stump up more cash for Kiev. In the worst - albeit less likely - scenario, so-called cross-default provisions carried by most Eurobonds would force payment on all Ukraine's remaining dollar bonds at once if Moscow is not paid on time. Putin, who has annexed Crimea and is widely accused of stoking a separatist revolt in eastern Ukraine, is seeking to maximize economic leverage to prevent pro-Western President Petro Poroshenko fulfilling a far reaching free trade agreement with the European Union. Under Russian pressure, the EU and Ukraine agreed this month to postpone implementation of the accord until the end of 2015 after Kiev accepted a ceasefire with the pro-Russian rebels in a conflict that has killed more than 3,000 people. At the heart of the bond issue is an unusual clause in the covenant which stipulates "total state debt and state-guaranteed debt should not at any time exceed an amount equal to 60 percent of the annual nominal gross domestic product (GDP) of Ukraine". REUTERS/Sergei Bondarenko/Kazakh Presidential Office/PoolRussian President Vladimir Putin (L) shakes hands with his Ukrainian counterpart Petro Poroshenko, as Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev (C) stands nearby, in Minsk August 26, 2014.As Ukraine's economy has shrunk and its currency has fallen, that level may already have been breached - Commerzbank analysts reckon the current hryvnia exchange rate around 13 per dollar is the trigger point. If not, debt-to-GDP will top 67 percent by end-2014, the International Monetary Fund predicts. "There is little doubt the ratio will be crossed," says Standard Bank analyst Tim Ash. "Russia will likely use this issue to make life very difficult for Ukraine." The issue is preying on Ukrainian officials' minds, Ash says, noting that Finance Minister Oleksander Shlapak told a recent conference he expects Moscow to demand early repayment. In that event, Kiev would dip into IMF money and the central bank's $16 billion reserves, Shlapak said. But even if Russia does not call the bonds, there are other ways it can use them to strengthen its position against Ukraine. Moscow was canny enough to structure the debt as Eurobonds governed by UK law and enforceable in British courts. So even without demanding repayment, the Kremlin as holder of almost a fifth of the outstanding bonds will wield huge clout if Ukraine is forced down the debt restructuring path. Because the other bonds are in relatively few hands - U.S. giant Franklin Templeton alone is believed to hold 40 percent - a debt workout without Russia could be relatively simple. Thus it would make sense for Ukraine to delay restructuring until the bail-bond expires in December 2015 - just to avoid facing Russia across the restructuring table. But it now looks unlikely Kiev can hang on that long.  "I don't think Russia wants to accelerate the bond because Ukraine does have the reserves to pay this debt. They want to be sitting at the restructuring table and have a say in the final outcome," said David Spegel, head of emerging debt strategy at BNP Paribas. "That's the reason the (IMF and EU) have been unwilling to push the restructuring issue, it's one of the biggest impediments." Putin's leverage over Kiev is not without risk for Moscow. Russian banks, some already weakened by Western sanctions over the Ukraine crisis, would take a hit of Ukraine defaults. Three big Russian institutions - Sberbank, VTB and Alfa - are among Ukraine's top banks by assets. Moody's estimated last year that Gazprombank, Vnesheconombank (VEB), Sberbank and VTB had a combined exposure to Ukrainian risk of up to $30 billion. Analysts say Russian banks also have large holdings of Ukrainian bonds though this has proved difficult to quantify. A Ukrainian default would almost certainly force losses on them. As Ukraine's finances worsen, bond markets have started to price in a debt restructuring. Many note it makes no sense for the IMF, after its Greece experience, to keep handing cash to a country without making bondholders share the pain. Gabriel Sterne, head of global macro at Oxford Economics, notes that Greece defaulted when confronted with a too-big-to-pay 12-billion euro maturity in 2012. For Ukraine, the Russian bond is the biggest payment on the horizon, not counting $5 billion or so in gas bills. "Ukraine have to admit at some point their debt is not sustainable and for me, the $3 billion payment is that point," Sterne said. "I would put odds on them not paying that bond in full." So far, there is no sign that Ukraine plans to repudiate the debt, though some have urged it to do exactly that. Georgetown University law professor Anna Gelpern has been prominent among those recommending that Ukraine refuse to honor the bond as "odious debt".  Anna Gelpern/Peterson Institute For International Economics The term refers to money borrowed by a previous regime that was either misappropriated or not used to citizens' benefit. Gelpern has also said the British parliament and courts should refuse to enforce the contracts on that Eurobond. That seems unlikely. Aside from the reputational damage caused by defaulting, courts rarely endorse the "odious debt" argument, says Spegel of BNP Paribas. Hardly any government has used it recently, not even Iraq after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein or post-apartheid South Africa, which might have had a case for doing so. "Although it was a liability taken on by Yanukovich and there are claims he may not have acted in the public interest... the fact remains that he was a democratically elected president, so the argument is unlikely to sit well with a court," Spegel said. Others point out that legal action around an odious debt appeal will take a long time and cross-defaults could be triggered in the meantime on other Eurobonds. "The easiest option for Ukraine might just be to repay early," said Ash of Standard Bank.   (Reporting by Sujata Rao; Editing by Paul Taylor) FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/William Hong The word from the ever-so-mysterious halls of Beijing is that longtime Central Bank head Zhou Xiaochuan may be on the way out. For anyone pushing for economic reform in China — who is concerned about the country's eye-popping over-250% debt-to-GDP ratio — this may be cause for concern. Zhou is a reformer, opposed to loose monetary policy.  In other words, Zhou is in favor of feeling pain now, for the short term, in order to balance the Chinese economy from one based on investment, to one more reliant on consumption. And for a moment there, it seemed like the government might be on board with Zhou. Earlier this month the country had a dismal economic data dump including the worst numbers for industrial production since 2008. According to Morgan Stanley, corporations are in even worse shape. A few years ago (or less), that might have meant it was time to turn on the money spigot — maybe lower interest rates — in order to still achieve the country's target GDP rate for the year. But as you can see from this Societe General chart, China has allowed its GDP to slow along with its industrial production. Societe Generale Instead of a full-on stimulus, China initiated some "targeted easing" in response to the bad data. It's a little bump, nothing life changing. As a result, analysts started talking about the government doing the once-unthinkable and missing its 2014 GDP rate target of 7.5%. The government is trying to tell the people of China that they should be okay with a slow down. At a recent conference, Xi Jinping indicated economic indicators were "still within a reasonable range” and that China would maintain “prudent monetary policy” and “targeted easing," Barclays reported in a recent note. The government mouthpiece, Xinhua News Agency, accused those calling for fresh stimulus after the bad data dump of "failing to clearly see the Chinese economy's new normal." Societe Generale Based on the news that Zhou is on the outs, though, it seems Chinese officials may be getting cold feet.  At a May 2014 meeting the head of the Central Bank's monetary policy said that, "Everybody seems to be interested in talking about reform, but they really fear what they are professing to love," according to the WSJ. Analysts now believe that China may miss a 2016 target to liberalize interest rates.  And while a full-on interest rate cut may not come now, Societe Generale wrote in a recent note that it could be coming in December. "...we think the central bank will have to change its language at the Q3 meeting and prepare the financial market for a lift-off. And if our outlook for growth and inflation continues to pan out, the CBC should deliver a 12.5bp cut at its December meeting, bringing the policy rate to 2%. That would still be just normalisation, as the policy rate is still far below the historical average." The problem is that "normal" may still be a problem for China's economy. Reform is about setting a new normal, not being complacent about more of the same. FREE AppDownload
ScreenshotJim Cramer. On Wednesday morning, Kyle Bass of Hayman Capital, a noted bear on central bank policy in the US and Japan, appeared on CNBC's Squawk Box. Among other topics, Bass talked a bit about the Fed's benchmark interest rate, which is currently pegged at 0%-0.25%. Bass said it's possible that rates never get back to "normal," which he sees as around 4%.  The math behind raising rates, however, is a bit daunting for the federal government, with Bass saying that for every 1% the Fed raises overnight rates, the cost for the US government to service its debt increases $150 billion.  Following these comments, Cramer took to Twitter, firing off a series of tweets venting a bit about Fed haters, hedge funds, and the idea that no matter what the Fed does, some people will always think it's wrong. The fabled "Fed Fund Rates should be at 4%" rap from Kyle Bass, like Stan Druckenmiller. Instant recession if we did this. @SquawkCNBC  I have heard endless hedge fund negatives about whatever the fed does. I find it tiresome but it is just the way it is.  More usual stuff from hedge funds: Fed's stupid policies, Bernanke didn't do any good. Hello? we would be in a Great Depression  I am simply tired of wealthy hedge fund managers telling us that the good guys in government were fools. Bernanke is a hero, not a goat  One last thought: no hedge fund manager is ever wrong. Ever. They are all brilliant and rich and always right. I should go back to the biz. All I am asking is why everyone blames the Fed for everything--but it is the President/ Congress that's the problem.. Fed doin' its best  Cramer is always animated on Twitter, and of course on the air. But it's unclear why Bass' comments really got Cramer going: is there something else about the Fed-haters that's eating Jim Cramer? FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersPeople's Bank of China Governor Zhou Xiaochuan addresses delegates at the UK-China Financial Forum at Lancaster House, in London(Reuters) - Chinese central bank Governor Zhou Xiaochuan may lose his job, the Wall Street Journal reported, in a reshuffle that follows internal battles over economic reforms. Chinese President Xi Jinping is considering replacing Zhou, the paper reported, quoting officials with knowledge of the plans. (http://on.wsj.com/1uZtmyj) The top contender to head the People's Bank of China is Guo Shuqing, a former banker and securities regulator who is currently governor of eastern Shandong province, the paper said. Xi wanted more allies in top positions in the government, military and Communist Party and personnel changes were expected around a major party meeting next month, the newspaper said, adding that no final decision had been made about the governor's job.

REUTERSStocks are rallying. In afternoon trade on Wednesday, the Dow was up 142 points, the S&amp;P 500 was up 13 points, and the Nasdaq was up 38 points. After opening slightly higher on Wednesday and then turning negative, stocks bounced off their lows and moved to session highs.  Tuesday marked the third straight losing session for the stock market, and a negative close on Wednesday would mark the first time this year stocks see losses in four straight sessions. Wednesday is a light day for the economic calender, but we did get new home sales that significantly beat expectations. New home sales rose 18% in August to an annualized pace of 504,000. This compared to expectations for an increase to an annualized rate of 430,000, with Wednesday's report marking the largest beat relative to expectations since May 2010. Also making headlines on Wednesday was a report from The Wall Street Journal that said China might push out the head of its central bank.  The SEC is also reportedly looking into certain activities in the ETF that tracks PIMCO's signature Total Return Bond Fund, with the regulator examining whether returns inside the exchange-traded fund were artificially boosted.  Among the notable stock movers was Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, up 6% after reporting better than expected earnings and revenue on Tuesday night.  FREE AppDownload

Pew Research CenterAmerica's young adults aren't rushing to tie the knot, and findings from a new Pew Research Center report suggest that couples are not getting married because 78% of single women want a partner with a "steady job." Unfortunately, with considerable changes in the labor market, the number of available employed men is a rapidly shrinking demographic. Wendy Wang and Kim Parker from the Pew Research Center write: As the share of never-married adults has climbed, the economic circumstances faced by both men and women have changed considerably.  Labor force participation among men, particularly young men, has fallen significantly over the past several decades. In 1960, 93% of men ages 25 to 34 were in the labor force and by 2012 that share had fallen to 82%. And among young men who are employed, wages have fallen over the past few decades. For men ages 25 to 34, median hourly wages have declined 20% since 1980 (after adjusting for inflation).  Over the same period, the wage gap between men and women has narrowed. In 2012, among workers ages 25 to 34, women’s hourly earnings were 93% those of men. In 1980, the ratio was less than 70%. According to the report based on census data, when millennials reach their mid-40s to mid-50s, approximately 25% of them (a record high share) will most likely still be single. FREE AppDownload
Bloomberg.comThe euro just fell below $1.28, extending the currency's ugly decline against the dollar. This comes as economic data continues to confirm deterioration in the euro area economy. Earlier today, we learned Germany's IFO business climate index fell to 104.7 in September from 106.3 in August. This was worse than the 105.8 expected by economists. "Weak growth in Eurozone trading partners, tensions with Ukraine and, possibly, a slowdown in China continue to weigh on the main German business survey index," Pantheon Macroeconomics' Claus Vistesen said. The European Central Bank has been easing policy further as economic activity stagnates and prices fall. In fact, the latest effort by the ECB to stimulate the economy flopped, and that has economists predicting even looser monetary policy. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve has been priming the market for tighter monetary policy as the US economy has continued to improve. All of this has resulted in a stronger dollar and higher US interest rates and a weaker euro and lower eurozone interest rates. In a research note to clients earlier this week, Goldman Sachs analysts forecasted that the euro would fall all the way to $1 by 2017. It's a long way from $1, but it's heading in that direction.

AP ImagesMario Draghi(Reuters) - Bank lending to private euro zone businesses needs to grow at a 3 percent annual rate on a sustained basis in order to stir inflation, according a Reuters poll of economists who say that is not likely to happen. In the latest monthly survey on European Central Bank policy taken Sept. 22-24, forecasters were also skeptical over whether the bank's latest offer of hundreds of billions of cheap cash in exchange for lending will even work. The consensus forecast is that banks will take up 175 billion euros at the next tender in December, which would take the total from two tenders to about 140 billion euros short of the 400 billion the ECB has put on offer. That echoes views from money market traders polled earlier this week and suggests that bank lending, which has been contracting for years and at last measure fell by 1.6 percent on an annual basis, is weak because of insufficient demand, not supply. "Things like this (TLTROs) are untried and untested and whilst in principle we can see it having some positive effect, it's difficult to be confident about how well it is going to work," said Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec. The ECB is not expected to announce any changes to policy at its meeting next week. It surprised markets this month by cutting its already miniscule refinancing rate to just 5 basis points, as well increasing its charge for overnight deposits to 20 basis points. But with lackluster demand for the ECB's cash, despite the lower cost of borrowing coupled with risks of deflation and weak economic growth across the region, the central bank may eventually have to buy government debt. Economists placed a 40 percent probability of the ECB buying sovereign bonds, the kind of stimulus programs undertaken by the Bank of England and U.S. Federal Reserve. The difference is the BoE has long shut its money printing press while the Fed will likely end its stimulus next month. Among its peers, only the Bank of Japan continues to buy asset-backed securities, government debt and exchange-traded funds, although inflation there is expected to stay below the central bank's target well into the future. In the euro zone, inflation rose to just 0.4 percent in August, slightly higher than July's 0.3 percent but widespread unemployment in member countries is unlikely to spur demand for goods and services, preventing a swift rise in prices. "Monetary policy is likely to have a limited impact on an economy with such serious structural problems as the euro zone," said Stephen Lewis, economist at ADM Investor Services. To arrest declining inflation and boost lending, the ECB earlier this month announced a program to buy asset-backed securities and covered bonds - a market considered fragmented and in its early stages in the euro zone. The ECB will likely spend 300 billion euros in that program over two years, the poll showed. The euro &lt;eur=&gt; has weakened just over 2 percent since the start of September as markets geared up for policy action from the ECB. That weaker exchange rate should help make imports costlier, giving a slight boost to overall inflation. Still, taken together, it means the ECB will eventually expand its balance sheet by only about half of the just over one trillion euros it lent out under the long-term refinancing operations in late 2012 and early 2013. "The one message that the crisis has taught us in terms of non-standard measures is that liquidity does not necessarily lead to lending," said Shaw at Investec. "At the end of the day, you have to have demand for that credit for those policies to work. And the extent to which firms and households want to borrow is questionable."   (Polling by Sarbani Haldar; Additional reporting by Deepti Govind; Editing by Ross Finley and Susan Fenton) FREE AppDownload
REUTERSChinese traders work at their computer terminals at the Shanghai Stock Exhange June 16, 1998.China’s economy is, at long last, undergoing a rebalancing, with growth rates having declined from more than 10% before 2008 to roughly 7.5% today. Is this China’s “new normal”, or should the country anticipate even slower growth in the coming decade? China’s rebalancing is apparent, first and foremost, in the export sector. Export growth has slowed from its 2001-08 average of 29% annually to below 10%, making foreign demand a far less critical engine of growth. Moreover, manufacturing employment and output, as a share of the total, began to decline last year. In fact, in the first half of this year, services accounted for more than half of total economic growth. It is no surprise, then, that China’s current account surplus has shrunk rapidly, from its 2007 peak of more than 10% of GDP to about 2% of GDP today. This rebalancing has helped to improve China’s income distribution. Indeed, in recent years, labour’s share of national income has been on the rise – a direct reflection of the decline in manufacturing and expansion in services. That has meant greater regional balance as well: The coastal provinces, which produce more than 85% of the country’s exports, are experiencing the most pronounced slowdown, while inland provinces have maintained relatively high growth rates. As a result, China’s Gini coefficient (a 100-point index of inequality, in which zero signifies absolute equality and one absolute inequality) fell to 0.50 in 2012, from 0.52 in 2010. Two principal factors are driving this shift. The first is the decline in global demand in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, which has forced China to adjust its growth model sooner than anticipated. The second is China’s ongoing demographic transformation. The share of working-age people (16-65 years old) in the total population has been declining since its 2010 peak of 72%. And the absolute number of working-age people has been falling since 2012. At the same time, China is undergoing rapid urbanization, with some 200 million people having left the agricultural sector in 2001-2008 to seek urban manufacturing jobs. More recently, however, the pace of migration has slowed substantially, with rural areas retaining 35% of China’s total labour force. All of this implies lower growth rates for China – though perhaps not as low as the 6-7% rates that economists like Liu Shijing and Cai Fang are predicting for the next decade. In fact, relying on China’s past growth record to predict future performance is inherently problematic, owing not only to important shifts in the labour force, but also to the fact that the speed and scale of China’s pre-2008 growth was unprecedented. For starters, it is likely that the contribution to output growth of the rising ratio of working-age people prior to 2010 was overestimated. That makes the subsequent decline in the ratio an inaccurate measure with which to determine the negative impact on economic performance. Moreover, this approach neglects the educational dividends that China will enjoy over the next 20 years, as the younger generation replaces older workers. As it stands, the rate of return-adjusted educational attainment for Chinese aged 50-60 is half that of those aged 20-25. In other words, young workers will be twice as productive as those entering retirement. Indeed, the level of educational attainment in China continues to improve. By 2020, the share of those aged 18-22 who are pursuing a college education will reach 40%, compared to 32% today. This improvement in human capital is bound to offset, to some extent, the net loss of labour. Furthermore, China’s low retirement age – 50 for women and 60 for men – provides policy-makers with considerable room to maneuver. Increasing the retirement age by just a half-year for each of the next 10 years would more than compensate for the annual decline in the labour force, which is projected to be 2.5 million workers during this period. Other trends are boosting China’s prospects further. Though investment is likely to decline as a share of GDP, it will probably take a decade for it to dip below 40% – still robust by international standards. Meanwhile, the capital stock can maintain a reasonable growth rate. Finally, China’s capacity for innovation is improving steadily, owing to rapidly increasing human capital and rising investment in research and development. By next year, Chinese R&amp;D expenditure, at 2.2% of GDP, will be closing in on advanced-country levels. Based on these trends – and assuming a constant labour-participation rate – China’s potential growth rate over the next decade is likely to hover around 6.9-7.6%, averaging 7.27%. This may be much lower than the 9.4% average growth rate in 1988-2013, but it is more than adequate by global standards. If this is China’s “new normal”, it would still be the envy of the rest of the world. FREE AppDownload

Matt Cardy/Getty ImagesThe widening wealth gap between the rich and the poor in the US is taking a toll on fast-food chains. Traffic at quick-service restaurants, which have an average check size of about $5, were flat in the year ending June 2014 compared to the same period last year, while traffic at fine-dining restaurants increased 3% over the same period, according to data from The NPD Group. The graph below illustrates the differences in traffic between high-end and low-end dining over the past three years.  The NPD Group Fast-food chains account for 80% of restaurant visits, so declining visits to those chains weigh heavily on the restaurant industry as a whole. NPD Group analyst Bonnie Riggs says restaurant operators need to give the middle class more dining options to make up for traffic declines at fast-food chains. Traffic at restaurants in which the average check size is between $10 and $20 grew just 5% between June 2011 and June 2014, while fine-dining traffic (defined as check sizes greater than $40) grew 11%. "Although the percentage of consumers identifying themselves with the middle class is shrinking, this group still represents a large segment of the population and shouldn’t be ignored," Riggs said in a release. "However, offering a good product at a fair price is no longer good enough. To attract them will take a deeper understanding of what they want when dining out." Beyond quality, affordable food, the middle class is also seeking exceptional service, atmosphere, and ambience when dining out, she told Business Insider. The share of households in the middle tier of income earners has fallen to 45% from 55% since the 1970s, according to The New York Times.  And those households in the middle tier haven't gotten a raise since 1999.  "After adjusting for inflation, US median household income is still 8% lower than it was before the recession, 9% lower than at its peak in 1999, and essentially unchanged since the end of the Reagan administration," The Times reports.

REUTERS/Aly SongGovernor of the People's Bank of China Zhou Xiaochuan.China's long-time Central Bank head Zhou Xiaochuan may be pushed out of office, the Wall Street Journal reports. President Xi Jinping is considering replacing him with someone more in agreement with him over economic reforms, according to party officials. Over the past few months there has been a distinct shift in Chinese policy. Xi has signaled that the country will no longer use economic stimulus — like infrastructural projects — and low interest rates to grow the economy. Some analysts estimate the country's debt-to-GDP ratio to be at about 250%. The government understands this is not sustainable. Reform, however, will be painful, and the economy is already showing signs of slowing down. Earlier this month the country released a slew of dismal economic data, including the lowest industrial production since 2008. China may miss its 2014 GDP growth target of 7.5% for the first time in years, and Xi has signaled that he may be OK with that. According to the Journal, the word is that Zhou may be replaced with Guo Shuqing, a former banker and securities regulator. Guo has been attending important meetings recently. Replacing Zhou, however, sends a completely different signal. He's a reformist who has tried to lay down the law on lifting government controls of the economy. He is also well-known entity on the international scene and represented China at meetings like the G20. From the Journal:  'Everybody seems to be interested in talking about reform, but they really fear what they are professing to love,' said Zhang Xiaohui, head of the PBOC's monetary-policy department, in a May 2014 meeting, according to a transcript of her remarks viewed by the Journal.

"Harold Hamm 2012 Shankbone" by David Shankbone/Wikimedia CommonsHarold Hamm was one of the Time 100 in 2012.Oil driller Continental Resources Inc. has been revising its corporate history in ways that diminish the publicly traded company’s accomplishments under CEO Harold Hamm, part of a legal strategy that might help Hamm avoid the largest divorce award in US history. Downplaying his role in Continental’s success is central to Hamm’s chances of minimizing the financial blow from his divorce, lawyers say. Under Oklahoma state law, if Hamm can show that market conditions — rather than his management prowess — drove the rise in Continental’s stock value during their marriage, he won’t have to share those gains with his estranged wife, Sue Ann. The two never signed a prenuptial agreement.   Testimony in the trial continues this week in the county courthouse here.  Hamm, 68, is a former energy adviser to Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and one of America’s wealthiest men. Sue Ann Hamm, 58, is a former lawyer at Continental. Attorneys following the Hamm divorce say a judgment could award Sue Ann Hamm about $3 billion. Reuters compared Continental’s current corporate website — www.contres.com — with a version from early this year. The analysis was done using the Internet Archive Wayback Machine, a repository of past web pages. The comparison identified 18 separate items that had been recently deleted, added, or revised. The changes included altering a claim that the company was first to “discover” an important oil field near the massive formation known as the Bakken Shale.  Wikimedia CommonsContinental Resources headquarters in Oklahoma.Another change involved adding a new claim about the company’s hugely profitable decision to shift its exploration focus from natural gas to oil. Now, the website shows the key decision came in 1985 — three years before the Hamms were married in 1988. If the shift to oil came prior to the Hamm marriage, then Sue Ann may not be entitled to reap part of the reward. Last month, Harold Hamm testified that he only recently discovered inaccurate claims on the website and ordered Continental’s staff to change them. The company also removed a notable passage from one of its U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings, key documents used by investors to evaluate firms.  In 2013 and earlier years, the annual proxy statement described Harold Hamm as “one of the driving forces” behind Continental’s success, a man who had “successfully grown the Company through his leadership skills and business judgment.” That passage was dropped in the 2014 proxy. At stake in the divorce is the $17.2 billion piece of Continental owned by Harold through his 68 percent holding in the company’s publicly traded shares. Legal experts interviewed for this article said the changes on the website appear to be part of his strategy. The purpose, they say, is to persuade the judge that the surge in Continental’s share value has had little to do with Harold’s deft management during his 26-year marriage to Sue Ann. According to state law, if the growth of Continental was “passive” — that is, owing to market factors beyond Harold’s control rather than to his skill and effort — he won’t have to share those gains. “The company may be framing Mr. Hamm’s impact as less important than it had before,” said Ilan Hirschfeld, head of the marital dissolution practice at accounting and advisory firm Marcum LLP. Hirschfeld isn’t involved in the case. A spokeswoman for Continental Resources, Kristin Miskovsky, declined to comment about the website changes or the role of Continental’s board in reviewing them. Attorneys representing the Hamms are under court order not to discuss protected information in the case. They declined to comment. FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Ammar Awad "Sell on Rosh Hashanah, and buy on Yom Kippur" is one of the more obscure calendar-based trading rules that old-school Wall Streeters watch. As he does every September, UBS' veteran trader Art Cashin tells the story in "Cashin's Comments." He writes: September Weakness And Rosh Hashanah — Tonight at sundown marks the start of Rosh Hashanah. Over 50 years ago, as I was starting out in Wall Street. I was lucky enough to be hired by a small, bright, aggressive firm where I learned unique things from some wonderful people. I thought they hired me because I was sharp, inquisitive and hard working. Some of the older salesmen, instead, used to joke that I was the "Shabbes Goy" — the only non-Jewish employee who could then man the phones on religious holidays. It was a joke (I think) but it gave an altar boy from Jersey City a chance to learn a little Yiddish and a touch of cultural traditions. The way I learned it, you sell on Rosh Hashanah and buy back on Yom Kippur. The thesis, I was told, was that you wished to be free (as much as possible) of the distraction of worldly goods during a period of reflection and self-appraisal. Later as I studied market cycles and economic cycles, I was struck that the oft-repeated September/October weakness (crop cycle/money float) often corresponded to the Rosh Hashanah tradition. Is it cultural coincidence or cultural overlap? Who knows! (And we've never had a Rosh Hashanah and a QE3.) One last note on Rosh Hashanah. My late, lamented Irish mom, tended to see everything in a Celtic perspective — even Jewish New Years.  She would say — "You better get up to the deli fast 'cause the Jewish people will be leaving early for ‘Rose of Shannon.'" Anyway, if it is your holiday, "Leshona Toyva Tikoseyvu!" Happy 5775! It's worth noting that last year the S&amp;P 500 went up by 2.11% from Rosh Hashanah to Yom Kippur.  However, historically the market does tend to drop during this time period. According to Bespoke Investment Group, it worked in eight of the previous 13 years. Bespoke Investment FREE AppDownload
ReutersTexan hedge fund manager Kyle Bass just dissed Bill Ackman big-time on CNBC.  "I would always bet on Dan Loeb any day over Bill Ackman," Bass said.  Bass, who runs Hayman Capital, was long Herbalife — a multilevel marketing company that sells weight-loss products. Bass said that one of Hayman's traders became an Herbalife distributor so they could understand the company.  "I believe it's a real business. I believe the FTC won't sue them. I believe it's not a ponzi scheme. But we just aren't involved now," Bass said.  Ackman, who runs Pershing Square Capital, has been crusading against the company for nearly 20 months. In December 2012, Ackman publicly revealed that he had a massive short against Herbalife. It's his belief that the company operates as a "pyramid scheme" that targets poor people. His thesis is predicated on regulators, specifically the Federal Trade Commission, shutting the company down. (The FTC did open a probe earlier this year.) Shortly after Ackman disclosed his short, Dan Loeb, who runs Third Point, snapped up a sizeable long position. Loeb called Ackman's thesis "preposterous." Soon after, Loeb exited his stake for a nice profit.  Bass criticized Ackman's Herbalife presentation. He said that you could "cut and paste" Ackman's old Pre-Paid Legal thesis with Herbalife and be long. In 2002, when Ackman was running Gotham Partners (his old hedge fund), he was long Pre-Paid Legal, a MLM.  After that, the show ended. The swipe was the last thing Bass said on live TV.

Wikimedia CommonsGoldman Sachs isn't worried about the effects of a stronger dollar. In a note to clients, Goldman Sachs economist Jari Stehn looks at the economic impacts of a strong dollar, which many argue is a negative for stocks and the economy, as a stronger dollar reduces the purchasing power of the US' international trading partners.  But Stehn writes that under Goldman's baseline scenario for the dollar, which sees the dollar strengthen another 3% on a broad, trade-weighted basis over the next year, the implications for growth, inflation, and Fed policy are limited.  Stehn writes: First, the growth effect of a stronger dollar is modest. Specifically, we find that the recent appreciation (if maintained) would lower real GDP growth by about 0.15 percentage point (pp) in 2015 and 0.1pp in 2016. If the dollar continues to appreciate, these growth effects become more significant at 0.25pp in 2015 and 0.3pp in 2016, as the effect of cumulative appreciation builds in outer years. Second, the inflation effect of dollar appreciation is negligible. Our simulations suggest that the effect of recent dollar strength on year-over-year core PCE inflation will be 0.01pp at the end of 2015 and 0.03pp at the end of 2016. With continued dollar appreciation, the effect is about twice as large. The intuition for a very small effect on inflation is that inflation in FRB/US depends primarily on the level of slack in the economy, not the growth rate of output. Finally, the implications of a stronger dollar for the Fed are limited. Under an inertial Taylor rule, the dollar appreciation observed to date (if maintained) would lower the warranted funds rate by 5 basis points (bp) at the end of 2015 and 15bp at the end of 2016. Continued dollar appreciation would, again, lead to somewhat larger effects. These three charts from Goldman illustrate the firm's expected — and somewhat muted — impacts of a strong dollar. Goldman Sachs Now, the important caveat is that if the dollar appreciates more than Goldman currently expects, these effects will be amplified, especially over the longer-term.  This past weekend, RBC Capital's Jonathan Golub wrote: "Conventional wisdom holds that a stronger exchange rate is likely to be a headwind for stocks as US products become less competitive abroad.

Dr. Ed's BlogDuring the previous decade, there was lots of buzz about the commodity super-cycle. In my opinion, super-cycles should last at least 20 years. If so, then the latest one in commodities wasn’t so super. I reckon it lasted about 10 years, kicked off by China’s joining the World Trade Organization in December 2001 and starting to peter out when China’s industrial production growth peaked at a record 20.7% on a y/y basis during February 2010. It was down to 6.9% last month. The proponents of the super-cycle assumed that rapidly growing demand for commodities in China would outstrip supplies for a very long time, pushing prices higher. They did rise for a while. But as they say in the commodity pits, the best cure for high commodity prices is high commodity prices. High prices stimulate capacity expansion and more output, which bring prices down, especially if the long-term demand assumptions turn out to be too optimistic.

Getty / David RyderSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc will boost staffing at its secretive Silicon Valley-based hardware unit by at least 27 percent over the next five years as it tests Internet-connected "smart" home gadgets such as a one-button device to order supplies. The plans, detailed in a little-known government document and by people familiar with the matter, signal Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos's intentions to double down on the No. 1 U.S. online retailer's hardware strategy. This is despite the lukewarm reception of Amazon's new Fire smart phone and some investors' criticism of its heavy spending on highly experimental projects. The Lab126 division, which developed Amazon's Kindle and other consumer electronics devices, plans to boost its full-time payroll to at least 3,757 people by 2019, according to the agreement reached with California in June that would give Amazon $1.2 million in tax breaks. Amazon will invest $55 million in Lab126's operations in Sunnyvale and Cupertino, the agreement posted on the California governor's website shows. This expansion comes as Lab126 tests connected-home devices that could open up a new front in its war against Google Inc and Apple Inc, two people familiar with Lab126's activities said recently. The sources requested anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the media. Technology companies see Internet-connected dishwashers, thermostats and other household devices that can "talk" to one another as ways to fuel demand for products and services. But skeptics say many of these devices cost too much for most consumers and could take years to go mainstream. Amazon is testing a simple WiFi device that could be placed in the kitchen or a closet, allowing customers to order products like detergent by pressing a button, one of the people said. Lab126 is also interested in wearable devices, the other person said. Both sources stressed that such devices may never come to market. These details shed rare light on the division at Amazon, which is notoriously tight-lipped about any unit's operations and staffing. In a statement, Amazon said Lab126 was moving "incredibly quickly" and cited the company's 2014 devices, including the Fire phone, Fire set-top box and several new tablets and e-readers. "We will continue to invent and create new features, services and products, and to support this innovation. Lab 126 is also growing very quickly," Amazon spokeswoman Kinley Pearsall said. Screenshot/CNBC Whether or not Amazon ultimately sells connected home and wearable devices, the experiments hint at Bezos' broader ambitions. Lab126 has become increasingly important to Amazon's broader aim to use devices to make it indispensable to its more than 240 million active users. Bezos is deeply involved in developing Lab126's projects, from the 2007 debut of the first Kindle e-reader to the Fire phone. The Fire phone, which Lab126 worked on for four years, debuted this summer to lackluster sales and reviews. Earlier this month, Amazon cut the price of its phone to 99 cents with a two-year contract with AT&amp;T. Amazon shares are down nearly 20 percent this year. Other tech leaders are also seeking a central place in the home. In January, Google bought Nest Labs, a smart thermostat maker for $3.2 billion. In June, Apple announced plans for HomeKit, its own framework for connecting household gadgets. Embedding households with such devices would be much more lucrative than merely selling gadgets like wireless LED light bulbs or wi-fi garage-door openers. With Lab126's experiments, Amazon envisions homes decked out with Internet-connected sensors that would allow it to tell customers ahead of time when they need to replace air conditioner filters or service their washing machines, one of the sources said. "If I walk into my laundry room and there's a big pool of water and the floor needs to be replaced, I'd love to know about it two weeks before it happens," said Ryo Koyama, CEO of Weaved, a startup working on connected-home technology. Lab126 had almost 3,000 full-time employees in its 2013 taxable year. (Reporting by Deepa Seetharaman and Noel Randewich; Editing by Richard Chang) FREE AppDownload

Via Dave Lutz of JonesTrading, here's a quick guide to what traders are talking about ahead of the market open: Good Morning! US futures are rebounding this AM, led by a 40bp pop in Russell names (IWM Ex-Divvy today). The action this week has been odd, as it feels a large global macro taking down Small exposure, but not risk – Russell Growth actually outperformed Value yesterday. Couple that with the $15B in S&amp;P futures that traded into the close yesterday (decoupled futures to cash by 45bp, a 4sd event according to MS) – we can see why illiquid equities are being manipulated heavily.

Thomson ReutersIndia's Prime Minister Modi gestures after giving a speech at his lecture meeting hosted by Nikkei Inc. and Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO) in TokyoNEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday said multinational cola giants PepsiCo &lt;pep.n&gt; and Coca-Cola &lt;ko.n&gt; should help augment fruit sales for Indian farmers by adding fresh fruit juices to their fizzy drinks. "Millions of people buy Pepsi and Coke. I have asked these companies if they can put five per cent natural juice in their drinks," Modi said on Wednesday in southern state of Karnataka. "If they can, then our farmers will make a lot of money. Our farmers will not have to throw their fruit away," he said after inaugurating a food park with a storage capacity of more than 20,000 tonnes for two dozen food processing companies. Modi's food processing minister said last month that PepsiCo should reduce the sugar content of its beverages, and asked the company to partner with the government to develop nutritious processed food for school students. The companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment. India, the world's second largest producer of fruits and vegetables, throws away fresh produce worth millions of dollars every year because of the country's lack of adequate cold storage facilities and refrigerated transport. Modi's made his pitch to the world's largest drink makers days before a trip to the United States, where he is scheduled to meet top executives from multinational companies, including from PepsiCo. The country has about 6,500 cold storage facilities and the prime minister is seeking foreign investments and technological upgrades to reduce food wastage and expand the food processing network. The U.S.-beverage companies have earlier stated that they are committed to expanding their presence in Asia's third-largest economy where a growing middle class has more to spend on processed beverages and food. PepsiCo, the maker of Pepsi-Cola, Frito-Lay snacks and Tropicana juice last year said it had plans to invest $5.5 billion in India. Coca-Cola Co in 2012 allocated $5 billion for investments in Indian market by 2020.   (Reporting by Rupam Jain Nair; Editing by Frank Jack Daniel ad Simon Cameron-Moore) FREE AppDownload

Thomson ReutersDavid Bonderman, Founding Partner, TPG Capital takes part in a panel discussion titled "Chinese Market Culture: How Well Can You Know a Company?" at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly HillsHONG KONG (Reuters) - TPG Capital founding partner David Bonderman said governments should stop legislating against Uber, the online for-hire car application which has run into multiple disputes with cab drivers and regulators in the United States and Europe. San Francisco-based Uber, which is backed by TPG, raised $1.2 billion from mutual funds and other investors in a June funding round, which valued the service at $18.2 billion at the time. Uber faces an array of regulatory and legal challenges, however, as it seeks to expand into new markets. "Governments should stay out of the way. Uber doesn't need government help particularly, but it doesn't need government interference," said Bonderman in response to an audience question about whether governments should support the business, at the annual SuperReturn private equity conference. Four-year-old Uber, which allows users to summon taxi-like services on their smartphones, has faced down regulatory scrutiny and court injunctions from its early days, even as it has expanded rapidly into roughly 150 cities around the world. A U.S. judge this month rejected a bid by Uber to dismiss a civil lawsuit that accuses the company of charging customers a 20 percent driver gratuity but pocketing most of the additional revenue instead. In Germany, also this month, a judge overturned a temporary injunction against Uber. Taxi Deutschland had sought the injunction as part of a civil lawsuit to bar the company's ride-sharing service. Such skirmishes with taxi operators and local authorities have shadowed Uber in many cities where it operates, starting in its home base of San Francisco. Active in 43 countries, Uber so far has only pulled out of one city - Vancouver, Canada. "Uber disintermediates the taxi industry and the taxi industry has its political clout in various places," said Bonderman at the conference in Hong Kong on Wednesday. He added that he believes such disputes will be resolved over time. (Reporting by Stephen Aldred; Editing by Ryan Woo) FREE AppDownload
Thomson ReutersFile photo of the logo of Volkswagen at the Frankfurt Motor ShowWOLFSBURG Germany (Reuters) - In an era of automation, robotics and spotless factory floors, you don’t expect to see car workers lugging metal along a production line. But at Volkswagen's main Wolfsburg plant earlier this year, workers had to resort to handing metal sheets to robots working on the E-Golf, said people who saw it happen. The improvisation came after the electric model failed a simulated U.S. crash test. Planners at the 76-year-old plant decided to stiffen the frame of the car. But there was nowhere to put extra robots on the crowded assembly line, they said. The worker-robot dance that ensued is just one sign that all is not well at Europe’s biggest carmaker. Relations between management and workers at VW’s global headquarters have deteriorated to a low last seen about a decade ago when VW cut about 20,000 jobs in Germany. Operating profit at the core VW brand is under pressure again, tumbling by a third in the first half of this year, due to lower sales, a weak dollar that translated into fewer euros, and spending on technology, including VW’s ambitious MQB modular production platform. When Volkswagen launched MQB in 2012, the company looked almost unstoppable. The system - meant to help VW become the biggest carmaker in the world - is designed to allow VW to build a huge variety of car sizes and shapes on a single production line, increasing flexibility while slashing assembly costs. But as the problems in Wolfsburg show, the platform can cause serious difficulties in the wrong environment. Rather than making it easy to build VW’s sprawling array of models, it has caused delays and forced overtime on some assembly lines, say company sources and production staff. The MQB problems have been caused by or have fed – it depends on who you talk to – increasingly tense relations between workers and management. Wolfsburg is a bastion of unionized labor. Together, the state of Lower Saxony, which owns a fifth of VW’s voting shares, and labor leaders have majority control of Volkswagen’s supervisory board, the powerful body that appoints and dismisses members of the management. Any important decisions, such as the building or shuttering of plants, need a two-thirds majority on the board. That makes restructuring particularly problematic. Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn has announced cost cuts of 5 billion euros ($6.43 billion), details of which are due this autumn. "We have a lot of catching-up to do with our core competitors. That is why we must now take action that is clear, effective and sometimes painful," Winterkorn told managers at a conference in mid-July. A week later, VW’s top labor representative Bernd Osterloh retorted that any such move would be difficult and that "sparks will really fly." In August, angry labor leaders forced VW to dismiss consulting firm McKinsey, which managers had hired to evaluate possible cuts without first consulting staff representatives. Osterloh feared McKinsey would lead VW into another bout of job cuts, according to a source familiar with the matter, instead of reducing research and development spending, which has surged 80 percent since 2010. His rare public attack on management signaled a serious rift in relations between management and labor. A week after Osterloh’s outburst, VW production chief Michael Macht resigned. VW will now employ Porsche Consulting, a division of its sports-car unit Porsche, to oversee the brand’s efficiency drive, according to two people familiar with the matter. VW and Porsche declined to comment. Volkswagen Wolfsburg can produce about 3,800 vehicles a day, more than any other VW plant in the world. The company will not say how many are actually being built there. But experts estimate the number is slightly more than 2,000, of which two-thirds are Golfs and the rest Tiguan compact SUVs and Touran family cars. Backed by red-hot demand in emerging markets, the Volkswagen group - brands include Audi, Porsche and Skoda – is selling almost 10 million vehicles a year, more than twice the amount when Winterkorn took over seven years ago. Sales have been boosted 81 percent to nearly 200 billion euros. But that growth masks the core brand’s flagging profitability and troubles in some overseas markets, such as the United States, Brazil and India. The VW brand’s profit margin of 2.3 percent is less than half its 6 percent long-term target. "VW's size is turning into a curse," said Stefan Bratzel, head of the Center of Automotive Management think-tank near Cologne. "Costs are beginning to get out of hand, inefficiencies keep growing and troubles are looming into focus around the world." In the past, VW was able to offset high German labor costs with economies of scale. MQB was designed to help with that. VW has said that MQB can reduce material costs by 20 percent, yielding potential annual cost savings of $19 billion by 2019, according to a Morgan Stanley estimate. The number of cars based on the system should quadruple to four million by 2016, VW said. "The Volkswagen group is fully on track with the introduction of the modular production strategy," VW wrote in an email to Reuters. "In total, there is the prospect of more than 40 different group models. So we are just at the beginning of this success story." But ongoing teething problems keep troubling production. One problem: the body shells for the top-selling Golf hatchback, which currently has 14 variants. Production has been disrupted at Wolfsburg because versions such as the electric E-Golf and the Sportsvan require different underbody fittings from the base model, sources said. VW suspended production of E-Golf models in August for fear that hundreds of holiday staffers, filling in for trained workers during the three-week summer vacation period, would struggle to cope, company sources said. As well, a faulty internet wireless network at Wolfsburg has caused robots to malfunction, the sources said. One worker at the plant said that too many automatic attempts by employees’ mobile phones to access the network overwhelm it. Other problems include a tendency of the system to stop if overheated in the summer. Resulting delays, together with bad maintenance and other flaws, are likely to cause output at VW’s key factory to remain below a planned target of almost 850,000 cars, company sources said. VW’s problems underscore a challenge faced by all German auto makers.   "Carmakers once thought that automation could rescue Germany as a location of industry," Mercedes-Benz production chief Markus Schaefer told Reuters. "But with an individualized product like what we're offering, automation is hitting its limits." Schaefer believes car plants should not exceed about 400,000 units a year. At Wolfsburg, VW is trying to build more than twice as many. REUTERS/Cesar FerrariBrazilian workers at Volkswagen's Sao Jose dos Pinhais factory disperse after attending an employee's assembly in Curitiba The power of VW’s unions is another hurdle. The works council, the body granting workers a say in corporate decisions, upped the ante recently by refusing to work some of the Sunday shifts that had been agreed for the third quarter, saying there was no point in working extra shifts when technical problems were continually causing delays and production outages. Many managers remember the fate of former VW CEO Bernd Pischetsrieder and VW brand chief Wolfgang Bernhard, who were forced out after labor rebellions put an end to a previous cost-cutting drive in 2007. The power of labor leaders to get rid of management at that time derived from a deal struck more than a decade earlier, in 1994, when the company gave job guarantees and promised further investment in German plants in exchange for pay cuts and extended working hours – a deal that at the time ensured VW's survival. Twenty years on, that means it is labor leaders at Wolfsburg who will largely determine the shape of cost cuts. VW managers in other regions have begun openly blaming Wolfsburg for the brand’s problems. VW’s U.S. chief Michael Horn said in January that changes were needed in Wolfsburg. An industry source said productivity at Wolfsburg is between 20 and 35 percent behind that of its premium brand Audi’s flagship Ingolstadt plant. Audi’s Finance Chief Axel Strotbek declined to comment on the gap, but said Audi had experience with an earlier modular construction platform and so had a headstart. VW also declined to comment on the productivity gap and said it's on course to solving the problems at Wolfsburg.  Workers, though, are bracing for more headaches. Yet another Golf variant, a performance-focused plug-in hybrid model called GTE, has been added to the crowded assembly lines this summer. Production of the Tiguan and Touran models will be switched to MQB next year. "Within such a big organization, it's fair to say that some people were made complacent by years of good results," one company official said. "The more turbulent times are back."

Thomson ReutersCEO of Air Lease Corp. Steven Udvar-Hazy rings the New York Stock Exchange bell alongside CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes Ray Conner at the Farnborough Airshow 2012 in southern EnglandISTANBUL (Reuters) - Aircraft leasing companies voiced confidence in steady jetliner demand, but warned new aviation investors that they may take a painful hit when central banks start unwinding their efforts to stimulate the economy. Deterred by poor returns elsewhere as interest rates remain at rock bottom, new money has been pouring into aviation in the hope of capturing greater profits thanks to a combination of ample liquidity and demand for jets. "Established lessors have enjoyed a positive interest rate environment but at the same time, the industry has been a magnet for money," said Steven Udvar-Hazy, chief executive of Air Lease Corp seen as a founder of the jet leasing industry. Aviation leasing companies account for up to 40 percent of aircraft being delivered and say they help to smooth swings in the market by renting out jets where demand is strongest. Many have overhauled their balance sheets to avoid new market shocks. But other investors such as sovereign wealth funds, private equity, real estate firms and non-specialist institutions are increasingly taking an interest in the $100 billion jet market. "The interest rate environment has been tremendously positive for the leasing community and airline industry," Udvar-Hazy told the Istat Europe air finance conference in Istanbul on Tuesday. "The counter-effect is that low interest rates have attracted a lot of other investors." An unofficial gauge of interest was the record attendance at this week's aviation conference, which drew over 1,000 jet traders, manufacturers and financiers to the Bosphorus. Over 40 percent polled in one session said they were attending the annual event for only the first or second time. It is Europe's version of an even larger U.S. gathering that started out three decades ago as a meeting of a group of second-hand jet sellers, which they nicknamed the "Junkdealers' Ball". Now, worldwide meetings of the International Society of Air Transport Aircraft Trading support an ecosystem with financial solutions for every part of the aircraft business, from loans for new jets to selling and leasing back their spare parts. "Five years ago, there would probably be 300 or 400 people in this room. We are closing on 1,100, so clearly there is interest in this space," said Jeff Knittel, president of CIT Transportation and International Finance &lt;cit.n&gt;. Flickr/Bjoern SchwarzEmirates Airbus A380 at Munich Airport The arrival of upgraded, more efficient airliners has sparked sales of thousands of Airbus and Boeing jets, but delegates said cheap money had helped to keep the party going. The Federal Reserve has kept interest rates near zero for more than five years, and this month said it will keep them there for a considerable time even after it ends its historic bond-buying program, which is to be wound down soon. Debt markets are not pricing in a U.S. rate rise before the second half of 2015, but aviation financiers are beginning to think about what happens when the tide turns. "The entire economy including airlines have got very used to low interest rates and no matter how (Federal Reserve Chair) Janet Yellen manages this process, I think it is going to be difficult and there will be winners and losers," said Peter Barrett, chief executive officer of SMBC Aviation Capital. The risks are not limited to financiers but airlines that have placed risky bets for aircraft, he said. "If it is a gradual, predictable rate of change I think we can all cope with it... If it is radical we are all going to have to put on our seat belts," Udvar-Hazy said. Despite recent order cancellations and instability in the Middle East and Ukraine, manufacturers and most lessors say the aircraft market itself remained strong. But they could not agree whether there was room for further growth in an industry regularly subject to external effects such as wars or epidemics. Udvar-Hazy said there was strong demand and limited availability of the industry's benchmark narrow-body jets. But Philip Scruggs, president of AerCap &lt;aer.n&gt;, the world's second-largest lessor, said the market had reached its top. Even for those confident the jetliner market will remain strong barring an abrupt rate hike or a deepening of China's economic slowdown, there are differences over how quickly Airbus and Boeing should raise production to meet that demand. Udvar-Hazy said he was worried about their ability to keep raising output without putting further pressure on their supply chains, amid shortages of items such as galleys and seats.

AP / RIA-Novosti, Alexei DruzhininIn this Tuesday, May 5, 2009 file photo, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, left, and Russian tycoon Vladimir Yevtushenkov, owner of Sistema Holding, during their meeting in Moscow.MOSCOW (Reuters) - A Moscow court adjourned on Wednesday without ruling on an appeal by businessman Vladimir Yevtushenkov against his house arrest as part of an investigation into money-laundering charges. The court will meet again on Thursday to consider the appeal by the chairman of Russia's Sistema conglomerate in a case that has shocked Russian business leaders and hit the company's share price. Judge Yuri Pasyunin said Yevtushenkov's lawyers had offered to pay 300 million roubles ($8 million) in bail to release Yevtushenkov from house arrest. He said proceedings had been adjourned to enable additional documents to be considered. Yevtushenkov was placed under house arrest last week on suspicion of involvement in money laundering over Sistema's acquisition of oil producer Bashneft. Sistema said last Friday that he had already been freed for house arrest. Investigators later denied this but the business newspaper Kommersant said Yevtushenkov had been allowed to visit his office this week. Sistema, which controls Russia's biggest mobile phone operator MTS, has described the charges against Yevtushenkov as baseless.

ITNFormer Tesco CEO Philip Clarke.What did former Tesco CEO Philip Clarke know and when did he know it? That's the most important question that will come out of new CEO Dave Lewis' investigation of the £250 million profit shortfall he announced last week, blaming the previous regime's faulty accounting, The Telegraph notes. The Financial Conduct Authority will also doubtless want to know why Clarke signed off on accounts that were declared at "risk of manipulation." And now a clearer idea of exactly what's wrong inside Tesco is emerging from the murk. It's scary because the practices disclosed at Tesco are, to one extent or another, common at other European supermarkets. Which means those grocery retailers may also have accounting skeletons lurking in their freezer sections. As The Telegraph reported, Tesco appeared to be booking as revenue promotional payments from suppliers, or credit offered to them, that it had not yet earned: One City analyst claimed that the company’s aggressive approach towards accounting for deals with suppliers was “well known” by previous management. Mike Dennis, analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, said: “This in our view is not all an accounting issue, but more a behavioural issue instilled by previous management into the trading and commercial teams to maintain a stable UK trading margin by deducting money from suppliers trading accounts, sending ‘requests’ for monies and extending credit terms where possible. ... “It’s hard to believe that this behaviour in Tesco was going on unnoticed by previous senior management as it was part of the core trading strategy to maintain group margins, and senior management were bonused on margin performance.” Reuters notes that a bunch of Tesco's competitors disclosed similar risks in their annual reports regarding judgments about how to account for supplier rebates, credit and promo payments: The auditors for all three of Britain's biggest publicly-quoted retailers - Tesco, Sainsbury's and Morrisons - told investors in their most recent annual reports that their businesses faced material risks regarding the reporting of the supplier rebates. Those at the smaller online retailer Ocado did likewise. France's Carrefour has more than €1 billion ($1.3 billion) in "outstanding receivables," Reuters adds: David McCarthy, an analyst at HSBC, said slowing sales growth at Tesco could have contributed to any inaccuracy in such calculations. "We suspect Tesco may have been booking promotional rebates based on historic precedent rather than on current volumes," he said. FREE AppDownload
Ulrich Baumgarten/Getty ImagesPARIS (Reuters) - European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi said on Wednesday that euro zone monetary policy would remain accommodative for a long period and that the goal was to push ultra-low inflation back up closer to the two percent level. "Monetary policy will remain accommodating for a long time and I can tell you that the (ECB) Governing Council is unanimous in committing itself to using the tools at its disposal to bring inflation back to just under two percent," Draghi said in an interview on French Europe 1 radio. "Interest rates will remain low because they can’t get much lower," he added. (Reporting by Mark John, Editing by Brian Love) FREE AppDownload

The Markit/JMMA flash Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) fell to a seasonally adjusted 51.7 in September from a final reading of 52.2 in August. The index remained above the 50 threshold that separates expansion from contraction for a fourth straight month. The figures could ease fears that manufacturers would scale back production as stocks of unsold goods swelled after the tax hike. The output component of the flash PMI index rose to 53.4 from a final 52.9 in August to reach the highest level in six months. The index for inventories of finished goods eased slightly to 50.2 from a final 50.9 in August. The new orders index eased slightly to 52.3 from a final 54.4 in August. The index for new export orders also fell to a preliminary 52.2 in September from a final reading of 52.8 in the previous month. Signs of rising factory output could help the economy recover from the shock of the sales tax hike to 8 percent from 5 percent. The tax increase dampened consumer spending more than many economists expected, triggering a sharp second-quarter contraction, and has taken some steam out of an expected third quarter rebound. Japan's exports have also struggled to rise as companies shift production overseas, which robs the economy of an important growth engine. Confidence at Japanese manufacturers fell the most in nearly two years in September, the monthly Reuters Tankan business confidence survey showed last week. The report raised fresh doubts about the effectiveness of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's plan to reflate the economy, which hinges on a strong pick-up in both corporate and consumer spending. The government will analyse data for July-September to decide whether to proceed with a second sales tax hike to 10 percent scheduled for late next year. The tax increases are needed to pay for rising welfare spending, but some politicians worry they will do too much damage to the economy. The final Markit/JMMA PMI for September will be released on Oct. 1.  (Reporting by Stanley White; Editing by Kim Coghill; stanley.white@thomsonreuters.com; +81 3 6441 1984 twitter.com/stanleywhite1; Reuters Messaging: stanley.white.reuters.com@reuters.net) FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Kevin CoombsA customer inside a branch of Starbucks in the Jimbocho district of Tokyo on March 15, 2007. Starbucks will take full ownership of its Japanese operations for more than $900 million, a move it said was aimed at further tapping its second-largest market. The Seattle-based company said it would buy a 60.5 percent stake that it does not already own as part of a two-step tender process expected to be completed by the first half of 2015. Japan was the first overseas destination for Starbucks when it expanded from the United States in 1996. The news, announced on Tuesday, sent shares of Starbucks Coffee Japan up 4.50 percent to 1,462 yen ($13) on the Jasdaq start-up market Wednesday morning. The Japan business, which was launched in 1996 and now has more than 1,000 locations, is a joint venture between Starbucks and Sazaby League, a Tokyo-based firm that operates a wide-range of brands from sundries and apparel to food and beverages services. Under the deal, Starbucks said it would buy Sazaby's 39.5 percent stake for $505 million, and then move to buy the remaining 21 percent held by other investors at a price of 1,465 yen per share, totalling of $408.5 million. Starbucks said the deal was aimed at further tapping the major market, including the possible launch in Japan of its Teavana tea chain. "The acquisition positions Starbucks to accelerate growth across multiple channels in Japan, including the potential introduction of new concepts," the company said in a statement. Starbucks' stores in Japan, which employ about 25,000 people, have so far held up against a recent downturn in the economy, and this month the unit raised its annual profit forecasts. For the fiscal year to March, the firm said it now expects net profit to rise 28 percent to 7.7 billion yen on sales of 137.7 billion yen. FREE AppDownload
