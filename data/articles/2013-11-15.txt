London's Heathrow is the fourth busiest airport on the planet, and it's not nearly big enough to handle the doubling in traffic the UK's Department for Transport predicts will hit by 2030. Some want to construct a third runway, but that would likely require the demolition of entire villages, as Heathrow is in a dense area outside London. There is a more outlandish idea that takes advantage of unused space: Build a new airport, and make it float on the estuary of the Thames River. One group pushing for this option, the Thames Estuary Research and Development Company (Testrad) has released new plans for its "innovative and spectacular" London Britannia Airport. It certainly is spectacular. Here's the view from the air: Thames Estuary Research and Development Company And a panoramic rendering: Testrad The interior looks awesome: Thames Estuary Research and Development Company The map includes space for future expansion: Testrad Testrad argues that a fresh airport would allow for better connections to the rest of the UK's transportation networks: Thames Estuary Research and Development Company
Peter Macdiarmid/Getty ImagesInstead of racking up debt while going to college, apprentices start earning money within their first year in the classroom. According to a recent report published by the office of Occupational Statistics and Employment Projections, enrolling in an apprenticeship program can be a cost effective way to boost earnings while gaining the job training you need. Most of these programs require apprentices to train with an experienced professional for at least¬†2,000 hours¬†as well as completing¬†classes. At the end of the program, apprentices receive¬†a nationally¬†recognized certificate of completion, either from the Department of Labor or from an approved state agency. There were more than¬†358,000 registered apprentices in more than 21,000 apprenticeship programs in 2012, according to the¬†DOL's website, mostly in¬†construction, manufacturing, and health-care industries. Popular¬†programs include electricians (four years),¬†cabinetmakers (four years), mine inspectors (four years),¬†firefighters (three years),¬†paramedics (two years),¬†pharmacy support staff (one year), correctional officers (one year),¬†and¬†dental assistants (one year). Last year, apprentices in an electrician program made an average of $23.96 per hour in their first year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This pay increases along with their experience throughout their four years in the program. Upon completion of the program, ideally, these workers will have made some money, acquired fewer student loans, have four years of work experience, and have potential contacts and references who will vouch for them. Many of the occupations that apprenticeships feed into are expected to grow at a fast rate in the coming years. For example, hiring for¬†dental hygienists¬†is projected to grow by 38% between 2010 to 2020, according to the BLS, and these professionals made an average annual salary of $68,250 as of 2010. Most apprenticeship programs are registered with the DOL and must meet certain guidelines set by the government. Expanding these programs may also help with unemployment rates, as they lessen the financial burden for those who need additional schooling or training. One such example is Germany,¬†which trains around 1.5 million apprentices per year and has a low¬†youth unemployment rate compared to its euro-zone¬†neighbors. Other countries are following Germany's footsteps, such as the U.K., which enrolled¬†more than half a million apprentices last year. Ramping up apprenticeship programs may be more difficult in the U.S., however, since they require significant cooperation between companies and the government. To apply to a program, you need to be at least 18 years of age and have a high school diploma or equivalent.
I‚Äôd like to share a personal story of an experience I had in the country that resonated. Many years ago when I was exploring a remote part of southern Luzon, I became very ill with a stomach infection.¬†I was in a small village with no hospitals around. The villagers, recognizing my plight, insisted that I rest in one of their homes. Then they found a doctor from a neighboring town to treat me. I could hardly work in the condition I was in and rested for a day and night under their care.¬†When I tried to pay them, they flatly refused.¬†This, of course, is typical of the Filipinos.¬†Their generosity and kindness should be well known by now, so our hearts go out to them at this time.¬† For now, it‚Äôs difficult to calculate the impact of Typhoon Haiyan on the economy of the Philippines, which had been expected to see GDP growth of 6.8%, higher than Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand or Malaysia‚Äôs growth projections1 this year.¬†Storm-related economic losses are expected to be in the tens of billions of dollars. In the US Northeast, Superstorm Sandy in 2012 knocked only about 1 percent off GDP; given its much-smaller economy, the economic impact on the Philippines is likely to be far more severe than that storm. However, I think the impact on growth from the typhoon should be relatively short-lived. We have seen examples of this in other countries; for example, Thailand was able to bounce back from a devastating tsunami in 2004 and floods in 2011. The Philippines should be able to rebuild, and with it, we think growth could be restored. Cash remittances sent from Filipinos working abroad, particularly in the US ,the Middle East¬†and Europe, are very important to the economy and should factor into its recovery.¬†For the first eight months of 2013, overseas workers sent home more than US$14 billion.2 From a monetary and fiscal policy perspective, I think the Philippines should have enough flexibility to respond to any fallout from the typhoon. In October, the nation‚Äôs central bank held its benchmark interest rate¬†at a record-low 3.5%, but there could be room to move lower if policymakers deem appropriate. A leader in the region, the Philippines was a founding member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), formed to accelerate the economic growth, social progress and cultural development in the region through joint endeavors, as well as promote peace and stability. For quite some time now, we‚Äôve had confidence in the prospects for the Philippines, which we still feel has significant potential. An English-speaking labor force with close US ties has given the country an edge in terms of business outsourcing and the like. President Benigno Aquino‚Äôs administration has engaged in reforms in recent years to make the country more attractive to foreign investors, and it has seen its global credit rating rise to investment grade. This recent calamity, and his ability to put the Philippines back in business, will mark a true test for Aquino, and could lead to more widespread reforms and progress which could ultimately prove beneficial for the economy. I think he, and his people, will rise to the challenge.¬† ¬† 1. Source: ‚ÄúWorld Economic Outlook,‚Äù October 2013. ¬© International Monetary Fund. All Rights Reserved. 2.

AP ImagesJP Morgan has reached a $4.5 billion settlement over mortgage-backed securities the bank sold to investors in the run-up to the financial crisis, the Wall Street Journal's Julie Steinberg and Dan Fitzpatrick report. A group of 21 institutional investors had been seeking $5.75 billion from the bank to settle all claims with JP Morgan (plus Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual, which JPM purchased during the mania of 2008). From the report: The deal, which could be announced as soon as Friday, does have some complications. It must be signed off on by several trustees overseeing the securities, including¬†Bank of New York Mellon¬†Corp., as well as needing court approval. The offer to the trustees, which were responsible for managing 330 individual mortgage-backed securities trusts, expires Jan. 15 but could be extended for an additional 60 days, said people familiar with the talks. The pact, agreed to by both sides, would resolve claims on securities issued by J.P. Morgan and Bear but not claims on securities issued by Washington Mutual. J.P. Morgan has since argued in court documents it isn't on the hook for any mistakes made by Washington Mutual before the Seattle thrift was seized by regulators. The final cost of the deal could go up if J.P. Morgan were to agree to settle over the Washington Mutual securities. According to the report, the two parties have discussed terms over the past year and finally agreed to a settlement this week. Read the full report at the WSJ¬†¬ª
REUTERS/Murad Sezer FA Insights is a daily newsletter from Business Insider that delivers the top news and commentary for financial advisors. There Hasn't Been A Great Rotation As Much As A ìSelective Rotationî (Advisor Perspectives)  The Great Rotation was a big theme at the start of the year with some talking about money rotating out of bonds and into stocks. But Eric Takaha, senior vice president and portfolio manager for Franklin Strategic Income Fund, says there hasn't been a ìGreat Rotationî as much as a ìSelective Rotation.î "Weíve certainly seen flows into the stock market, and thatís helped equity performance in 2013. If you look across the fixed income market, we have seen money coming out of some money market instruments and some of the government-related instruments. On the other hand, bank loans have had more than a year of positive inflows, week after week. Even high-yield corporate bonds have seen money coming back in of late.† "I think investors in general are distinguishing between short-term money markets and the very low yields in government bonds versus some of the other fixed income sectors that can offer a bit higher income stream. So while we have seen money going into equities and money coming out of certain fixed income products this year, overall we havenít seen a great rotation out of all of fixed income." Rosenberg: Here Are 2 Signs The Stock Market Is Getting Less Frothy (Gluskin Sheff)  As stocks headed to all-time highs and investors piled into the asset class, some started warning that it looked frothy. But Gluskin Sheff's David Rosenberg thinks there are two key signs that the stock market is getting less frothy.† 1. "First, the the IPO market is clearly cooling off so far in November, and investor bidding once the new issue hits the market has become far less aggressive." 2 "The bull-bear spread pulled back 250 basis points, which is good from the perspective of getting out of the 'danger zone' from a complacency standpoint." Three Ways Advisors Can Prepare For Market Volatility (Investment News)  Joe Duran, CEO of United Capital Financial Advisors, thinks advisors should look for opportunities in volatility. Duran thinks there are three key ways to do this. 1. "Prepare for the inevitable." Warn your clients that stock prices could fall and help them with their blind spots. 2. "Control the controllable." It is important for the client to understand that neither they nor you own the market but that you can "control their reaction to markets." 3. "Communicate. Communicate. Communicate." Communicate with clients in good times and bad. You Can Create A Portfolio With Passive Risk (Alliance Bernstein Blog) Passive investments are rarely that, according to Ashwin Alankar of Alliance Bernstein. In fact they are subject to market volatility. But he thinks there are ways to create a portfolio with passive risk. "The trick is to take a dynamic approach that aims to undo the randomness of volatility," he writes. "At the index level, the idea is to de-risk exposure to equities to when overall index volatility rises. For example, when Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke started talking about tapering the asset purchase program in May 2013, the average volatility of the S&amp;P 500 jumped from 12% to 20%. "In other words, stocks became nearly twice as risky as they were before, so a $100 investment in the S&amp;P 500 is now risking $20 instead of $12. To maintain the initial risk profile, the prudent response would be to get rid of the additional risk by moving $40ónearly half of the totalóout of the index into cash. That way, even though index volatility has nearly doubled, an investor hasnít taken on any more risk. By doing this, the varying risk of an index can be flattened to a desired constant in expectations." These Are The Top Three Criteria When Picking An Alternative Investment Provider (FA Mag)  The most important factor in picking an alternative investment provider is a high level of integrity and transparency, according to a survey of advisors by Franklin Square cited by FA Mag. Ninety-two percent of advisors said this is the most important criteria to consider. Ninety-one percent of advisors said consistent investment performance was important and 82% said a low correlation to other asset classes was important. 
REUTERS/Lucas Jackson We recently ran a depressing anonymous Quora post detailing typical days of a corporate law associate and how utterly pointless that work can seem. At best, on not-busy days, he spends†11.25 hours alone in his office proofreading and marking documents without any human interaction, except for the brief exchanges with workers in the coffee shop, the cafeteria, and document services. At worst, on busy days, the drudgery is never-ending. The anonymous lawyer describes getting into the office at 8:15 a.m. and still being there when the Asia office sent over some documents at 2 a.m. the next day. A powerful partner was copied on the documents, so our lawyer turned the documents around right away which included "such wonderful 2 a.m. tasks as adding brackets to the trailers on signature pages." Our associate only went home at 3:45 a.m., knowing clients would start emailing again at 7 a.m. It's one thing to stay late at the office if you're doing edifying, challenging work, and if you can catch your breath for a couple days after a long night, but that doesn't seem to be the case here. Our anonymous lawyer doesn't seem to get any satisfaction out of the work, noting that "it all seems completely pointless." Perhaps things would be better for this lawyer if the office were more collegial. After all, a lot of people have work that doesn't necessarily feed their souls. They can still enjoy the day if they have colleagues they like and feel like they're needed and appreciated. But that doesn't seem to be the case, either. More from our anonymous lawyer: When you add partners who scream at you (and do indeed throw objects when angry), associates who routinely backstab each other, fixed salaries and bonuses so that there is no link between pay and performance, or pay and value add, and partnership odds of roughly 1 in 25 to 1 in 50 ó as well as sometimes weeks on end in which you do not leave the office before midnight ó there are just a lot of things not to like about the practice of law. We interviewed a former lawyer earlier this year who left the practice of law, in part because of the type of nastiness that anonymous lawyer describes. She recalled that once her firm held a "diversity training" that encouraged lawyers to say hello to one another so they'd feel less alienated. The partners and senior associates didn't like the idea of saying hi to underlings, though. The entire experience, our source told us, "was just not very humanizing."

Every so often, I write about how Obamacare transfers wealth from the healthy to the sick, and while that's a just thing, we can't necessarily expect the healthy to be happy about it. When I write this, I tend to get responses from liberals arguing that transfers from the healthy to the sick aren't a policy choice; they're just an obvious characteristic of insurance: @jbarro @jbouie ALL ins works that way-good drivers pay for bad drivers; living ppl pay for dead ppl (life ins); healthy pay for sick. All insurance is a transfer to people who experience losses from people who do not.†Health insurance is special in that it is a transfer to people who have high expected losses from people who do not. Liberals think this special feature is desirable; conservatives are uneasy about it. Let's look at a simple property insurance example. Imagine a state where 50% of homes are located on the ocean and 50% are not. The oceanfront homes have a 10% chance of storm damage in a given year and the other homes have a 1% chance.†Storm damage always results in a loss of $50,000 and the insurer has a profit margin of 10%. By my calculations, oceanfront homeowners in this state will pay property insurance premiums of $5,500 and non-oceanfront homeowners will pay $550. This insurance market will, in any given year, transfer money to the homeowners hit by storms from the homeowners who escape storms. But it will not, in the long run, transfer wealth from low-risk homeowners to high-risk homeowners. Over time, homeowners on the ocean can be expected to pay 91% of all premiums and make 91% of all claims. Health insurance does not work like this. A variety of subsidies, regulations and norms conspire to ensure that people with high expected health costs†ó the equivalent of the oceanfront homeowners†ó pay premiums that are less than their expected claims. Their claims costs are cross subsidized by healthy people†ó the equivalent of inland homeowners†ó who pay far more in premiums than they can be expected to make in claims. There's a challenge with any insurance market like this: How do you get the healthy people (or the inland homeowners) to buy insurance that's a bad deal for them? In the case of health insurance, we use a pile of subsidies, regulations and norms to goad the low risks into overpaying so they can subsidize the high risks. We give out generous tax subsidies to buy health insurance, require employers to offer group health insurance on roughly the same terms across their employee populations, provide direct government health insurance to the old and the poor, and (under Obamacare) add new subsidies and penalties to push people into insurance. This stuff is all enormously expensive, but it gets most everybody covered. As insurance markets go, health insurance is totally weird. But it's not totally random. Health insurance has to be unlike other insurance for a few reasons: So, there are good reasons for health insurance to be weird, and to include transfers toward people with high expected losses. But conservatives are uneasy about using health insurance to shift the cost of expected losses for some valid reasons. 
ShutterstockCorn futures are down more than 1% after the EPA proposed lowering the amount of renewable fuel required by refiners when making gasoline. Earlier this year, we discussed how the high requirement was nudging gas prices higher by running up costs on refiners. Because of trending declines in gasoline demand, refiners aren't making enough fuel to match the amount of ethanol the government mandates they must add to their blends. As a result, the price on special dispensations, called Renewable Identification Numbers or RINs, to get around the requirements began to climb.¬† Plus, the AP's Dina Cappiello and Adam Goldman had a blockbuster report this week¬†on how the government's renewable fuels push has created all sorts of horrible unintended environmental consequences, including polluting drinking supplies and wiping out habits. So, today's news may be a net plus.
Sound confusing? Not really. Think of it this way: volatility determines much of the risk profile of any asset. So when market volatility fluctuates, the risk of a passive investment in the marketís index changes. For example, if you invested $100 in the MSCI World Index earlier this year when volatility was hovering at about 11%, you risked losing $11. Yet little more than a year earlier, when volatility was nearly 25%, the same $100 in the same index put $25 at risk. With this in mind, isnít it a misnomer to describe a fund with such variable risk as a passive investment? Donít Ignore Sector Volatility Our colleagues have written extensively on the concentration risks of investing in a benchmark. For example, in 2000, the technology sector ballooned to nearly 30% of the S&amp;P 500 Index, leaving investors exposed to the crash. However, less attention is typically paid to the volatility risks of erratic sector behavior, as illustrated in the left-hand chart below. Alliance Bernstein Blog At around the same time that indices were getting bloated with technology stocks, the risk of being in that sector shot up fourfoldóaccounting for 50% of the total index risk, as illustrated in the above index risk decomposition chart. When oil prices flare up amid Middle East tensions, the volatility of the energy sector will typically rise as well. And of course, during the global financial crisis, the financial sector accounted for more than 30% of the MSCI Worldís total volatility. In other words, you may have ditched your active manager to invest in a market capitalizationñweighted global equity index, but instead you are letting the world actively manage your money. Conventional wisdom that passively managed buy-and-hold portfolios, such as many market-cap benchmarks, yield passive investments is not entirely true. Passive management of an investment portfolio in a dynamic world results in active and variable risk-taking. Flattening the Waves Is there a way to create a portfolio that delivers truly passive risk? We think so. The trick is to take a dynamic approach that aims to undo the randomness of volatility. An ideal passive benchmark would convert the waves to a fixed straight line, as shown in the right-hand chart above. The flat lines reflect equal passive non-varying risk-taking in each sector. So if there are seven sectors in the benchmark, a flat line at about 15% yields equal risk for each sector. That may sound easier said than done. But when the passive proposition is clearly redefined, it can be achieved. At the index level, the idea is to de-risk exposure to equities to when overall index volatility rises. For example, when Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke started talking about tapering the asset purchase program in May 2013, the average volatility of the S&amp;P 500 jumped from 12% to 20%. In other words, stocks became nearly twice as risky as they were before, so a $100 investment in the S&amp;P 500 is now risking $20 instead of $12. To maintain the initial risk profile, the prudent response would be to get rid of the additional risk by moving $40ónearly half of the totalóout of the index into cash. That way, even though index volatility has nearly doubled, an investor hasnít taken on any more risk. By doing this, the varying risk of an index can be flattened to a desired constant in expectations, as illustrated below. Alliance Bernstein Blog The same exercise can be done at the sector level. When a sectorís volatility spikes, shift some of the total away into other sectors and/or cash. This will maintain a static risk profile even when one sector or another suddenly becomes more precarious. This approach may sound complex, but the good news is that it can be achieved at a reasonable incremental cost that would be slightly more expensive than a purely passive approach, yet much cheaper than an actively managed portfolio. We think thatís a small price to pay to keep volatility from spoiling your passive portfolio.
BloombergWhat are they serving on the floor of the CME? Yesterday, Tres Knippa, a futures trader and head of a shop called¬†Kenai Capital, told Bloomberg TV that Fed Vice Chair Janet Yellen should be withdrawing her name from consideration to helm the office.¬† The conversation begins with Bloomberg host Betty Liu asking what he made of Yellen's testimony, and how he will now position his assets for the rest of the trading year.¬† "Well first of all, Janet Yellen should withdraw her name from consideration," he responds, point blank.  "Or the Senate should do everything they can to block her nomination," he continued. That seems just unlikely as Yellen self-withdrawing ‚Äî or self-deporting, something Knippa may also wish Yellen would do.  The Senators were mostly cordial to her, and even Sen. Rand Paul, who plans to bring up a vote on a Fed audit bill, says she will likely get confirmed.  So who is Knippa?¬† Well, he runs a site called¬†ShortJapanDebt.com. "Long term there is a significant likelihood Japan will experience a sovereign debt crisis," it says. "As a result it is my belief there is an opportunity to trade and be net short the Japanese government bond market." This trade is known as the "widowmaker" trade, and basically numerous self-styled macro experts have been wheeled out stretchers thinking that just because Japan has a high debt-to-GDP ratio, it's inevitable the bond market will crash. We should also note Knippa at one point this spring Tweeted a link to an appearance by his "friend" Jeff Berwick, the head of DollarVigilante.com. If you're not familiar with that site, all you need to know is that its tagline is "SURVIVING &amp; PROSPERING DURING AND AFTER THE DOLLAR COLLAPSE," ALL IN CAPS. So basically, Knippa is a hard money doomer who thinks everything's on the verge of collapse. Yellen should be proud to have him as a critic.
Business at Costco is thriving. The retailer is posting gains even as competitors like Wal-Mart and Target have struggled to attract cash-strapped consumers.¬† Analysts at Trefis have pinpointed a few reasons for Costco's incredible success.¬† 1. Customers want deals. It's estimated that shoppers can save up to 55% on groceries from buying in bulk at warehouse chains, write the analysts at Trefis. Costco also keeps prices low by keeping store displays at a minimum and offering fewer items. The retailer only marks up merchandise 15%, compared with a 25% average for most grocery chains.¬† "Due to these bargains, the warehouse club industry sales have grown¬†at a higher rate than general merchandise store sales over the last decade," the analysts write.¬† 2. Costco is hyper-focused on local markets. The brand "grants its local store managers some discretion over the products that are kept in stores," the analysts at Trefis write. Demand for salsa is highest in the Southwest region of the U.S., so stores there are sure to stay stocked up, for example.¬† 3. Costco changes its brands often.¬†¬†"Customers always find something new at its stores and get a 'treasure hunt‚Äô¬†experience,'" say the Trefis analysts. The retailer occasionally offers some high-end items like Coach purses and Dom¬†Perignon champagne to further intrigue shoppers.¬†

The Pit / ScreengrabThis just over the Bloomberg, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange admits that it experienced a 'cyber intrusion' in July and that "certain customer information relating to the CME ClearPort platform was compromised." Tades and clearing, however, were not impacted. A criminal investigation into this issue is ongoing. Cyber security has been a major issue on Wall Street over the past couple of years ó they've even played out worst case scenarios.  Wonder where this falls on that scale... Here's the CME's press release on the matter: CHICAGO, Nov. 15, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- In a communication to certain customers today, CME Group confirmed it was the victim of a cyber intrusion in July, making it one of the many organizations subject to this type of crime in recent months.

Some experts believe that the tight correlation between stock prices and the Federal Reserve's growing balance sheet proves that the stock market is effectively being driven up by the Fed. In other words, they believe this correlation looks more like causation. But Bank of America Merrill Lynch's Ethan Harris thinks that's ridiculous. From his recent note: We believe this chart is an example of ‚Äúspurious correlation‚Äù‚Äîa high correlation between two series that is coincidental rather than causal. One of the big no-no‚Äôs in statistics is to correlate two trending variables, because the correlation will tend to capture the separate time trends in each variable rather than the interaction between the two variables. This is a very common problem for macroeconomic data and asset prices because the business cycle triggers long co-movements among many variables. To put the correlation in perspective, over the last 5 years the Fed balance sheet has a correlation of 0.92 with the CPI, and a huge 0.97 correlation with new truck prices. Both the population and the price of alcohol have a 0.91 correlation with the Fed‚Äôs balance sheet: taken literally the Fed is pushing people to drink, drive and have children. The fear by many is that the tapering and eventual end of QE means the end of the stock market. Then again, others argue that the end of QE would only happen when the economy is back on track, which could bolster the market.
Some of the most successful people on Wall Street, have gotten where they are in ways you might not expect. Take the case of Home Depot founder, billionaire Ken Langone. In an interview with finance career site OneWire, he explains the winding road he took to finance, and it's no standard story. His grades in college weren't conventional: "Bucknell [University] used to send out a snapshot of where you stood in your first 8 weeks of the semester, and I was literally getting an F in every subject I took. I was taking a course in basic economics, and [the professor] handed out all the papers with the grades. After the class, he announced he wanted to see me. He took the exam out and threw the paper on the desk and said 'That is the worst English I have ever read in my entire life. I had to struggle to understand what you were saying, but once I figured it out, I've never had a freshman that understood the concept of supply and demand better than you.'" And the way he got to his first job at a bond trading firm wasn't conventional either: "I decided I was going to go to Wall Street and I was introduced to some people...I met a guy who knew a bond trader at Pressprich, and he got me to meet him and the guy that ran their sales department, Jack Collin. And he said 'We can't hire you, we're like everybody else in the street, trying to control our overheads.' So I turned around and I left, and then I went back up upstairs and asked to see Jack Collin again. I said, 'What do you pay your secretary, a 150 a week? OK, pay me a 150 a week. I'll run classes three nights a week in accounting and securities analysis for your trainees. But there's one hook- you have to give me every account you're not doing business with. In 3 and a half years I was made a partner.'" Ultimately Langone founded Home Depot and turned 3,000 kids that started out pushing carts in his store into multi-millionaires.

Given the Federal Reserve's focus on U.S. economic data and its implications for policy, it's helpful to understand which parts of the economy are getting stronger and which ones aren't. Following last week's release of the first look at Q3 U.S. GDP, Barclays economists put together 22 charts breaking down by sector how the recovery has progressed over the past six years relative to other recoveries. "Despite the pickup in Q3, the recovery in GDP in the current cycle remains sub-par," write the economists in a note clients. "The weakness of consumer spending is the main reason. Consumption growth slowed in Q3 and is likely still suffering from a delayed response to tax hikes at the start of the year. The recovery in income growth and savings since then is an encouraging sign that consumer spending growth will pick up in Q4 and 2014." Thanks to Barclays for permission to run these charts.

Wikimedia CommonsInvestors have been pouring billions of dollars into stocks, leading BofA to conclude in a note earlier this month that "It's Getting Frothy, Man!" Now Gluskin-Sheff's David Rosenberg is out with a note highlighting two reasons why things might cooling down a bit. Here's Rosenberg: SOME SIGNS OF FROTH COMING OFF THE BOIL First, the the IPO market is clearly cooling off so far in November, and investor bidding once the new issue hits the market has become far less aggressive. Let's call it an encouraging development ‚Äî greed is never good (sorry, Gordon) from a contrary perspective. Second, there are still a plurality of bulls out there, but at the margin, the latest Investors Intelligence poll showed a downtick to 52.6% from 55.2% the week before, though the bear camp stayed low at 15.5% (from 15.6%). Still, the bull-bear spread pulled back 250 basis points, which is good from the perspective of getting out of the 'danger zone' from a complacency standpoint. Meanwhile, markets continue to chug along and reach new highs.
fdecomite at www.flickr.comDOWN a muddy path in a clearing in the forest of Compi√®gne, in northern France, lies a musty-smelling little museum. Amid scraps from trench life displayed in glass cabinets, the museum's chief exhibit is an old oak railway-carriage, a replica of wagon 2419D, used on this spot by Marshall Foch to sign the 1918 armistice with Germany--and then by a vengeful Adolf Hitler to secure France's surrender to Nazi forces in 1940. The modest memorial is a big and sobering reminder of the historical impulses that prompted the French to pursue the post-war European project. As President Fran√ßois Hollande prepares for the centenary of the start of the first world war next year, however, it also exposes a widening gap between those ambitions and a new French ambivalence about the European Union. As a founder-member with Germany, France has, for over half a century, put the construction of Europe and the taming of Germany at the heart of foreign policy. If the British have grown up on tabloid Euroscepticism to regard Europe as a menace to national power, the French have been taught to see Europe as an amplifier of theirs. Europe, according to the French creed, is the solution, not the problem. To any new obstacle: more Europe still. Yet four years after the start of the euro-zone crisis, with joblessness at a 16-year high and a recession-battered economy, disillusion has set in. In today's French mind, the EU has become too big, too distant, too focused on austerity and trade: a constraint, not a means of salvation. Only 41% of the French now say that they are favourably disposed to the EU, according to Pew Research, far fewer than in Germany (60%)--and fewer even than in Britain (43%). Fully 77% say that European integration has weakened their economy, more than in Spain or Italy. One in three of the French would leave the EU today, according to a YouGov poll. On the fringes of French politics, populists are surfing this sentiment with zeal. When Mr Hollande on November 12th welcomed EU leaders to Paris to discuss youth unemployment, Jean-Luc M√©lenchon, a Communist-backed firebrand, derided them as the "undertakers of the European ideal". On the far right, Marine Le Pen predicts gleefully that the EU will collapse "like the Soviet Union" under the weight of its own contradictions. Her National Front could come first in European Parliament elections next May. Even the pro-European elite is voicing its second thoughts. Fran√ßois Heisbourg, of the Foundation for Strategic Research, has just published "The End of the European Dream", which argues that the euro cannot survive without a degree of integration that is politically unrealistic. His remedy? The orderly dismantling of the single currency in order to rebuild the EU on solid ground. French ambivalence towards Europe is not entirely new. France voted by only a whisker for the 1992 Maastricht Treaty, which launched the euro, and in 2005 sprung a shock by voting against the draft European constitution. Nor is it new for French leaders, left and right, to grumble about Europe--in particular the unloved European Commission--while using its edicts to impose unpalatable reforms at home. In the past, however, such setbacks did not alter the elite's generally unshakable faith in further integration, or their confidence in their ability to shape it as they wanted. What seems different this time is that euro-antipathy is curbing France's European vision. Security policy aside, France has become, in the words of a European diplomat, "low-ambition" on Europe. It is not that the French lack ideas. They are pushing for banking union; they want a budget for the euro zone (a simpler forum to operate in, without the pesky British); and proper social transfers. But much of their Europe policy is defensive. They are prickly about criticism in Brussels of economic weakness and tried to shrug off news that GDP shrank by 0.1% in the third quarter. They dislike attempts to meddle in national policy; the commission, snapped Mr Hollande, should not "dictate" pension reform in France. They are set against any talk of a new treaty and nervous about Germany's preference for competitiveness "contracts" that would allow Brussels to intrude even more. The upshot is that France is in a state "not of retreat, but resignation" over Europe, says Thomas Klau of the European Council on Foreign Relations. This matters. Although today's more assertive Germany has outgrown the need to be handcuffed to its neighbour over the Rhine, it knows that little can get done, especially on the euro, without France. Germany may lead Europe, but it does not want to be seen to be deciding everything alone. A prot√©g√© of Jacques Delors, architect of the single currency, Mr Hollande intends to be a good European and a genuine partner. But he is caught in a pincer-hold that is partly of his own making. He is struggling to rally support among smaller countries for his sort of Europe--more solidarity, less economic oversight. At the same time, his standing at home is curbing his ability to make the case for more Europe. After various mishandled muddles and a tax revolt, Mr Hollande's authority has sunk, and his poll rating has dropped to just 21%, a record low. The result, laments a French official, is "zero political debate about Europe". Crablike, Mr Hollande is trying to do just enough on Europe, without aggravating nationalism at home. Through the 1914 centenary, he still hopes to find words to rehabilitate Europe and unite the nation. "To commemorate", he declared in a remembrance speech marked by vocabulary usually reserved for the right, "is to renew patriotism." Yet however moving the centenary events next year prove, or memorials like that in Compi√®gne remain, France's faltering faith in the European project will make it an increasingly unpredictable partner.

Lucy Nicholson / REUTERSBloomberg columnist Jonathan Weil wrote a scathing column on the way Tesla reports its earnings this morning. Headline: Are There Cockroaches Under Teslaís Hood? From the first paragraph Weil's point is clear ó Tesla's consistent issues with clear reporting and accounting suggest something is amiss.† "Sometimes Tesla acts like it doesnít know what itís doing when it comes to financial reporting," he writes. Weil points to Tesla's Q3 earnings report as example after example of this clumsiness. The company reported third quarter earnings with a declaration that it had a ìnet income (non-GAAP) of $16 million.î The the company's earnings statement discussed nonstandard metrics until the 4th page before also reporting a $38 million loss under GAAP metrics. The thing is, to the SEC this may not just be a 'whoops.' Agency regulation states that a company's financial disclosures must give GAAP numbers ìequal or greater prominenceî than non-GAAP numbers. And in Tesla's case, there was a 40% difference between non-GAAP and GAAP revenue. That is because of the way the company calculates revenue from a financing program it started back in April, according to accounting research firm CFRA's Dan Mahoney. Weil writes: Hereís how it worked. In April, Tesla started a new financing program under which customers have the option to sell their vehicles back to the company after three years for guaranteed minimum amounts. The accounting rules say Tesla canít recognize all of the revenue immediately in those instances and must account for such transactions as leases. So after Tesla takes customersí cash, it records liabilities for ìdeferred revenueî and ìresale value guaranteeî on its balance sheet. Mahoney noted two main problems with including so much of those amounts in non-GAAP revenue. Some customers wouldnít have chosen Tesla cars were it not for the financing program. So the non-GAAP revenue isnít comparable to Teslaís sales before the program began, and it may overstate the true growth and demand. Plus, by adding back the resale-value guarantee, the company ìassumes that nobody is going to return the vehicle, for purposes of the non-GAAP revenue,î he said. Not good, and what's worse, as Weil points out, is that reporting like this is fodder for investors that believe in the cockroach theory ó that when there's one problem, there's like another... and another... and another... This is a must read for anyone interested in the Tesla story at all, so check out the full report at Bloomberg&gt;
China Photos/Getty Images)Days after China wrapped up its four-day 3rd Plenum meeting, we're beginning to see some reforms trickle out. Chinese state news agency Xinhua reported that China will abolish the "laojiao" or re-education through labor system that was developed in the 1950s to hold political prisoners. China's re-education camps are notorious for their human rights abuses. Prisoners can be held in one of 300 such camps for three to four years without trial. People were sent to these labor camps for a range of 'crimes' that varied from prostitution to dissent against the Communist Party. Falun Gong practitioners have been sent to these camps. And in the case that shook the nation, Tang Hui, a mother, spent 18 months in prison for pushing for harsher punishment for the men who abducted and gang-raped her seven year old daughter. BI's Adam Taylor previously pointed out alleged torture tactics used in the†Masanjia Womenís Reeducation Through Labor Camp† in northeastern Chinaís Liaoning province, that was first reported by Lens Magazine.: Here are two personal accounts of torture from Masanjia published verbatim from Chinascope: Example one: The 2010 United Nations Report submitted to Manfred Nowak, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, included the following description in his 2010 Report: ìOn 2 September 2008, Mr. Yuís term was extended for another year. He was sent back to Masanjia Forced Labor Camp in October, and has been held in solitary confinement since then. At the camp, Mr. Yu was forced to sign a suicide letter before he was beaten, including on his head with a steel baton, hung and shocked with electric batons. As a result, he bled severely and lost consciousness for more than a week. Repeated requests by his family to visit him have been denied.î† Example two: On June 4, 2002, without any legal recourse, cause, or documentation, Ms. Wang was taken to Masanjia Forced Labor Camp. During the day, more than four collaborators participated in the torture of Falun Gong practitioners. They interrogated Ms. Wang and tried to force her to give up practicing Falun Gong. They made her squat, remain in a kneeling position, or stand still for a very long time. Typical torture methods included hanging her up by her hands, which were handcuffed behind her back, or forcing her to stand still or squat for a long time. Another time, two guards from Benxi, holding electric batons, shouted, "We will see who is tougher!" The two men tore Ms. Wang's shirt open and shocked her breasts with two electric batons for 30 minutes. Afterwards, they made her stand still for the entire night. Her breasts were disfigured and became infected. Finally, Ms. Wang gained her release. Later her family found out that the Masanjia camp staff believed that she had only two months to live. Among other reforms, China will also reduce the number of crimes subject to the death penalty. Approximately 4,000 people are executed annually in the country and a number of those executed are white collar criminals. Today's announcement also pointed out that "lawyers will play an important role in protecting the legal rights and interests of citizens and corporations in line with the law." But not everyone thinks this is definitive enough.† "While abolishing the RTL system is a big step in the right direction, the reality is that the authorities are finding new ways to punish the same types of people, including sending them to other types of arbitrary detention, such as the so-called ëbrain washing centersí and ëblack jailsí," Amnesty International said in a release.  "Without a fundamental change in policies that drive the punishment and targeting of individuals such as petitioners, human rights activists and Falun Gong members, there is the very real risk that the Chinese authorities will abolish one system of arbitrary detention only to expand the use of others." We will have to wait and see if China finally is heading towards rule-of-law.
Third quarter global smartphone sales came out earlier this week. The message was clear: Apple is getting its clock cleaned by Samsung, which is now by far the dominant smartphone maker in the world. (Samsung had 32% of the global market in Q3, the same share as a year ago. Apple, meanwhile, had only 12% of the market, down from 14% a year ago.) Yes, both companies sold more smartphones this year than last year. But Apple's sales badly lagged both Samsung and, importantly, the broader smartphone market. Apple's sales increased 23%. Samsung's increased 46%. The smartphone market as a whole, meanwhile, grew 46%. In other words, Apple's smartphone sales grew at only half the rate of the market. Apple fans have developed excuses for Apple's lagging sales. The most popular is that Apple is a "premium" gadget maker, not a hoi polloi gadget maker, and it only wants to sell its phones (and tablets) to people who can afford to pony up for them. Apple, in other words, is like BMW, not Ford. There are two big problems with this analogy. First, unlike cars, smartphones are a "platform market" ó third parties build products and services that run on top of smartphones ó and in platform markets, market share is a huge competitive advantage. Second, in emerging markets, which is where most of the growth in smartphones and tablets now is, there just aren't that many people who want to buy BMWs when many very high-quality gadgets are available for much lower prices.† The actual reason that Apple's gadget sales are now so badly underperforming the market is that Apple no longer sells products at price points that appeal to the growth segment of the market.† Apple fans can keep telling themselves that this is just fine, that Apple doesn't want or need to sell gadgets to earthlings of more average wealth, but what these fans need to recognize is that this is effectively a major change in Apple's pricing strategy. In the first few years after the iPhone and iPad launched, Apple led the market not just in product quality but in product price. The iPhone and iPad were not just way better than the competition, they also cost the same or less. Now, Apple may still have an edge in product quality (this is debatable and a matter of personal preference), but in most countries, its gadgets are considerably more expensive than the alternatives. And those alternatives ó from Samsung, Google, Amazon, and many other vendors ó are getting better and better. If gadgets were not a platform market, this wouldn't matter. But they are. And the more market share Apple surrenders in China, Brazil, India, et al, the less chance it will have to become the leading platform in these countries. †(In fact, in many of them, it's probably already too late.) The simple answer is NOT for Apple to make low-end gadgets that it considers crappy. It is for Apple to use its phenomenal profitability as a competitive weapon. Specifically, the answer is for Apple to sell some of its gadgets -ó not the latest, greatest ones, but some ó at prices that are highly competitive with local alternatives. Now that Apple has "forked" its iPhone product line into the 5S and 5C, for example, it could sell the 5C at a sharply lower price point. Instead, Apple is still charging almost as much for the 5C as the 5S. (Yes, Apple is selling the iPhone 4 at a significantly lower price than the 5s, but this phone is now old, weak, and small.) Similarly, in iPads, Apple is selling its "Mini" at prices that are radically higher than high-quality alternatives. Instead, it could sell the latest, greatest version of the Mini at a high price and other recent models at a very competitive price. Importantly, this would cost Apple nothing more than some near-term profits. And Apple has plenty of profit to spare. (In fact, it has so much profit to spare that it has no idea what to do with the cash piling up on its balance sheet.) Significantly increasing its market share in key markets around the world would make Apple's long-term competitive position much stronger. It would help Apple increase the value of its content and app "ecosystem" in these countries and, thereby, strengthen the "lock-in" of its products and services. But, instead, Apple is being shortsighted and choosing to maintain its already fantastically high profit margins at the expense of market share. Let's go to the charts: (These charts are all from BI Intelligence, our premium industry research service. You can sign up for a free trial here &gt;) First, as you can see, the global smartphone and tablet markets are still growing like mad. Here's smartphones: Business Insider And here's tablets: Business Insider And now look at Apple's growth in these markets. First, as the line in the chart below shows, Apple's iPhone sales have slowed sharply: Business Insider Apple's tablet sales, meanwhile, have hit a wall. (Yes, the new iPads will help. But it is going to be very hard for Apple to make up this lost ground.) Business Insider When confronted with these statistics, Apple fans generally point out that Apple still has a very strong position in the U.S. market and that Americans keep scarfing up Apple's top-of-the-line iPhones. That's true. Apple's market share in the United States is indeed strong, as the following chart shows: Business Insider But the U.S. is an anomaly. In most other countries, Apple is losing share fast. And that means that, at best, Apple is missing a massive opportunity. The bottom line is that, by trying to maintain its price points and super-high profit margin, Apple has radically underperformed the market for the past couple of years, especially in tablets. Because of the importance of the platform and ecosystem for long-term value, this is a shortsighted decision. Meanwhile, Google's Android has become the world's dominant smartphone and tablet platform: Business Insider Business Insider Business Insider If Apple continues to pursue its current pricing and maximize-short-term profit strategy, it may continue to increase its profits for the next couple of years. (BlackBerry and Nokia grew earnings for a couple of years after some analysts began seeing the writing on the wall.) But Apple will also continue to lose platform and ecosystem share in most of the world. Apple fans can talk all they want about how Apple is "like BMW," but in a couple of key competitive respects, it isn't. And if the gadget platform market behaves the way other platform markets have (think Windows), Apple and its fans may come to regret this short-term thinking in the end.

According to Boeing, Middle Eastern airlines will need more than 2,600 new planes in the next 20 years, a market worth about $550 billion. Air traffic in the region is growing much faster than in the rest of the world, and airlines like Etihad, Emirates, and Qatar Airways are more interested in twin-aisle planes than smaller, cheaper single-aisle ones. That's partly because of the Gulf's location, Boeing VP of Marketing Randy Tinseth said in a statement. These airlines can connect Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia with one-stop flights, so they want big planes that can move lots of passengers on lucrative routes. A lot of that $550 billion could be spent next week at the Dubai Air Show ‚Äî Reuters predicts a "$100 billion Boeing order bonanza" by Middle Eastern carriers.

Library of CongressJohn Pierpont Morgan, presumably threatening to fire his director of social media.JPMorgan had a bit of a public relations nightmare Wednesday when the #AskJPM hashtag it designated for its planned Twitter question and answer session was hijacked by a storm of users furious with the bank for its perceived role in the financial crisis of 2008. The bile lobbed at JPMorgan (click here for some of the best zingers) was so great that the bank†ultimately canceled vice chairman Jimmy Lee's online chat with the public. While the hashtag hijacking was certainly an obvious outcome to people who follow controversial brands on social media (remember McDonald's ill-fated #McDStories?), the truth is that being a bank brand on Twitter isn't exactly easy these days. Not when many Americans are still reeling from the financial collapse and†more than half of them†still feel the government hasn't done enough to punish the bankers they think are responsible for it. To top it off, financial institutions have the added challenge of trying to have casual conversations on social media while working within the legal restrictions of what they can and can't say. We talked with several social media and branding experts to get their takes on just how banks can interact with the public online without walking into a deluge of populist anger. Here's what they had to say: Sean Womack, SVP of Marketing and Production at Touchstorm: Womack says JPMorgan erred by trying to approach the open-ended forum of Twitter, in which many people talk to many other people at the same time, in the same way they are used to approaching traditional advertising, in which one brand talks to a large group of people. In his view, JPMorgan didn't totally understand that it wasn't only talking to their customers. "Twitter is like a party where you can't just show up and say it's yours and take over.†You don't walk in and say 'Hey, JPMorgan in the house! Ask me a question.' without first looking at who's†in the room.î Victor Pineiro, Strategy Director at Big Spaceship:†Pineiro says JPMorgan was likely taking its cue from the success celebrities have had doing Ask Me Anything (AMA) question-and-answer sessions on Reddit. But while these conversations sometimes win people good will for transparency, oftentimes controversial speakers find themselves in the cross-hairs in a way that didn't expect. Instead, he says, brands with less-than-perfect reputations might want to use social media in ways that focus more on adding value for the people who are already their customers than on winning over new people with conversational chatter. "You see a lot of social businesses that are more about utility than anything else. These brands are mostly about couponing, and donít tap into the conversation and feel the need to talk about the holidays coming up. I think thereís a lot of appreciation for that when people are finding these brands who try to force their way into the conversation fairly annoying.î Jamie Gutfreund, Chief Strategy Officer at Creative Artists Agency's The Intelligence Group:†Gutfreund has written extensively about the consumer behavior of millennials, a group that makes up a large portion of the Twitter audience and that she says is more likely to reject companies whose ethics don't align with their own. She pointed to American Express as an example of how a financial brand can provide value to these young people by offering discounts based around various hashtags and creating the Passion Project to help fund the creative endeavors they care about. Gutfreund says that with 75% of millennials looking to become more financially savvy, there is a huge opportunity for JPMorgan and other financial firms to cater to young adults on social media, so long as they are willing to take the time to build relationships, first.† "In this new world, if you want to connect with a younger audience, especially on social media, you really have to perceive how they feel about you. JPMorgan has not taken those steps to earn a dialogue. "They just need to take this as a learning opportunity and go back out with a little more knowledge. I commend them for making an effort, but I do hope they don't retrench and stop trying to connect because they're too burned by it."†

Associated PressJos. A. Bank Clothiers Inc terminated its offer to buy Men's Wearhouse Inc , sending Men's Wearhouse shares down as much as 11% before the bell, although Jos. A. Bank did not rule out another bid for its larger rival in future. Jos. A. Bank had said it would terminate its proposal if the Men's Wearhouse board did not engage in good faith negotiations by November 14. "(If)... we are invited by the Men's Wearhouse board to discuss our acquisition ... or if circumstances were otherwise to change, Jos. A. Bank may consider whether a new proposal to acquire Men's Wearhouse is warranted," Jos. A. Bank said on Friday. Men's Wearhouse largest shareholder, Hedge fund Eminence Capital LLC, expressed disappointment that the company's board had failed to engage in merger discussions. Eminence Capital, which owns about 10% of Men's Wearhouse, said that by allowing the deadline to expire, the company's board had confirmed it was not committed to fulfilling its basic fiduciary duties to shareholders. Jos. A. Bank offered to buy Men's Wearhouse for about $2.3 billion, or $48 per share, in cash but was swiftly rebuffed by its larger rival, which dismissed the offer as inadequate. Men's Wearhouse was founded in 1973 by George Zimmer, known to U.S. television audiences for his advertising catchphrase - "You're gonna like the way you look - I guarantee it." Men's Wearhouse, which ousted Zimmer in June, also adopted a poison pill to prevent a hostile takeover. A 100-year-old seller of men's tailored and casual clothing, Jos. A. Bank has over 600 stores in the United States, according to the company's website. Men's Wearhouse is being advised by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, JPMorgan Chase and law firm Willkie Farr &amp; Gallagher. Goldman Sachs and Financo were Jos. A. Bank's financial advisers and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom and Guilfoil Petzall &amp; Shoemake its legal advisers. Men's Wearhouse shares were trading at $45.25 before the bell. The stock last traded at $35.24 before the offer was announced on October 9. It closed at $46.12 on Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange.
With India's 10% gold import duty on top of other capital controls, the price one has to pay for gold in India has reached a record spread of 21.6% vs. what one has to pay in countries where there are no such controls or import duties. My friend Nick at Sharelynx Gold pinged me earlier today with a chart that shows the premium one has to pay to buy gold in India.

Manufacturing production rose 0.3%, its third-straight month of gains, and analysts so far are focusing on that gain: Headline #IP (-0.1% vs. +0.7%) was dragged down by utilities. More importantly, manufacturing IP was up a solid +0.3% vs. +0.1% previously Mining output fell -1.6%, the first decline in six months. Utilities fell -1.1% after having jumped 4.5% in September. The headline print matched the 2007 average and was 3.2% percent above last October. "The anticipated decline in industrial production contrasts with the strength in the manufacturing ISM index, although the details are unlikely to be as weak as the headline figure," High Frequency Economics' Jim O'Sullivan said in an advance note. "Within the report, we expect at least a modest gain in non-auto manufacturing, with offsets from autos, utilities and mining." We've mostly been back in positive territory since the recession: FRED But you can also see that the recession shunted the overall trajectory to another, slower gear: FRED¬† Click here for updates ¬ª
Zulily, a flash sales site for children's clothing and accessories, is going public today at $2.6 billion valuation. As Fortune's Dan Primack points out, the tech press has largely ignored Zulily's big day, despite it's high valuation and the fact that its shares are priced above the IPO range. Well, Primack is right. This is a pretty big IPO, especially because flash sales sites haven't been doing so hot lately. (Maybe you've heard of Fab and its recent troubles.) According to Primack, Zulily is slightly profit ble and brought in $439 million in revenue for the first nine month of the year. That's up from $202 million for the same period in 2012. Sounds like a healthy, growing business. Zulily (ZU) will start trading on NASDAQ later this morning.
Bill Ackman's hedge fund Pershing Square has taken a 9.77% stake in mortgage insurer Freddie Mac, and a 9.98% stake in Fannie Mae according to government filings. This after yesterday Bruce Berkowitz of Fairholme Capital Management announced that he and other investors were willing to buy and recapitalize Freddie Mac and its sister company Fannie Mae. "This proposal is about the future," Berkowitz said in a CNBC interview yesterday, later adding, "We are apolitical, we will do it any way government wants." And what the government wants is to wind down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ó they just may not want to do it with the help of activist money managers. This summer, Senators Bob Corker and (R-TN) and Mark Warner (D-VA) have introduced legislation to replace Fannie and Freddie with "privately capitalized system that preserves market liquidity and protects taxpayers from future economic downturns." It's called The Housing Finance Reform and Taxpayer Protection Act (S. 1217), and here's what it does:
Google ImagesWhat year is it again? Venezuela President Nicholas Maduro has announced the arrest of 100 " bourgeois" businessmen accused of price gouging, Reuters' Andrew Cawthorne and Deisey Buitrago report. "They are barbaric, these capitalist parasites!" the pair say Maduro thundered in a speech heralding the round-up. "We have more than 100 of the bourgeoisie behind bars at the moment." You'll recall "parasites" is the same word used by Vladimir Lenin to describe landowning former peasants who were subsequently killed by the thousands in Soviet Russia. The arrests come three weeks before local elections agreed to be a consensus on Maduro's administration since the 50-year-old former bus driver succeeded Hugo Chavez. Inflation in Venezuela has soared more than 50% in the past month, which Maduro blames on†a conspiracy by an amorphously defined opposition seeking to bring down the socialist regime.†In the past week, soldiers and inspectors have raided more than 1,400 shops and occupied an electronics firm and a battery manufacturer.† The government has also shut down websites showing the bolivar at 10 times the official rate of 6.3 to the dollar. Many blame an artificially overvalued bolivar for the malaise.†We've previously explained how Venezuelans were exploiting black market exchange rates. †† Maduro says he is waging "economic war." Reuters says the campaign will likely help consolidate his base among the poor and unite factions in the Socialist Party. But a prominent anti-Maduro columnist has likened the campaign to moves made by Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe. Opposition party Justice First says Maduro is producing a dystopian society. "This shows the economic chaos Maduro has got us in where prices have no logic. The government created this monster and now tries to pretend it will control it, but Venezuelans cannot be deceived by this electoral show," Justice First said.
Flickr/RednuhtInvestigators are looking into whether a cadre of traders dubbed "the cartel" or "the bandits club" rigged currency rates, the New York Times' Ben Protess, Landon Thomas Jr., and Chad Bray report. Earlier this month, we brought you the full explainer on how the alleged scheme works, but basically the idea is that forex traders might be colluding to tamper with a benchmark rate in order to increase their bottom line. From the Times: The trading group called ìthe cartel,î or ìthe bandits club,î included employees from R.B.S. and UBS, people briefed on the investigation say. It is unclear when the group was operational or if it ever crossed a legal line. The former member of the group told colleagues that individual client names werenít discussed in the electronic chat rooms. Instead, the traders occasionally discussed positions in an effort to match buyers and sellers, according to the person briefed on the group. Once again, the smoking gun for investigators might come down to incriminating instant messages. So it's no surprise that JP Morgan ó a bank currently in the penalty box with regulators ó told its employees to stop "bullshitting" over chat.† Read the full report at the New York Times†ª
">Daniel Goodman / Business InsiderThe November reading of the Empire State manufacturing index is out, and it's ugly. The regional activity index unexpectedly fell to -2.21 in November from 1.52 in October. Economists were expecting the number to climb to 5.00. "Despite the softer trend in the past few months in this index, we still view manufacturing as being on a positive trend on a national level," said Barclays' Cooper Howes. "Given the relatively small amount of manufacturing activity that takes place in the Northeast relative to other areas such as the Midwest, the recent prints in the Empire State do not yet suggest substantial downside risk to that view." From the release: The November 2013 Empire State Manufacturing Survey indicates that manufacturing conditions weakened somewhat for New York manufacturers. The general business conditions index fell four points to -2.2, its first negative reading since May. The new orders index also entered negative territory, falling thirteen points to -5.5, and the shipments index moved below zero with a fourteen-point drop to -0.5. The prices paid index fell five points to 17.1, indicating a slowing of input price increases. The prices received index fell to -4.0; the negative reading was a sign that selling prices had declined‚Äîtheir first retreat in two years. Labor market conditions were also weak, with the index for number of employees falling four points to 0.0, while the average workweek index dropped to -5.3. Despite the negative readings registered by many of the indexes for current activity, indexes for the six-month outlook continued to convey a strong degree of optimism about future business conditions.

Bloomberg TVTom Lee.Yesterday, the S&amp;P 500 closed at 1790, an all-time high. JPMorgan chief U.S. equity strategist Tom Lee's year-end target for the index was 1775. However, given his continued constructive view on the stock market, he raises his year-end target to 1825 today in a note to clients. "In our view, the case for continuing to maintain a positive stance on equities remains in place given: (i) improving economic momentum to support upward EPS revisions (pent-up demand in U.S. housing, autos, construction, capex and a recovery in the euro area); (ii) attractive relative value (particularly vs. corporate bonds), (iii) supportive monetary policy and (iv) sentiment that is not excessively bullish," says Lee. "We continue to believe that the U.S. is in a secular bull market and that remaining constructive on equities is warranted." Lee says half of the 50-point increase in his S&amp;P 500 target is driven by the tech and financials sectors. "Much of the increase into year-end (50 points) is driven by sectors with lower P/Es, which we expect to re-rate higher into YE, with half of the points coming from Technology and Financials," says Lee.†"Both trade at roughly a 10% discount to the S&amp;P 500." Despite the positive outlook, there is one threat to a higher stock market on Lee's radar. "The biggest risk to our thesis, in our view, remains the potential for a negative monetary policy surprise (more likely in the U.S. than Europe)," he says. "That is, we believe equities remain uncomfortable with the notion of asset tapering without the economy at perceived escape velocity."
First, the lay of the land: Global GDP growth is accelerating for the first time in three years, and Credit Suisse expects year-over-year growth to move from 2.7 percent in the second quarter of this year to as high as 3.75 percent by the end of next year. In the United States, housing remains relatively affordable and employment growth should boost consumer spending. Next year, euro-zone austerity measures will lessen, consumer demand should turn positive for the first time in two years and the economy should expand by 1.5 percent. At the same time, macroeconomic uncertainty is fading. The U.S. budget deficit is falling, and the European Central Bank has accepted responsibility as lender of last resort to indebted countries. Stanford University‚Äôs gauge of policy-related economic uncertainty has fallen to its lowest level since 2008 in the U.S. and since 2011 in Europe. As a result, U.S. bond yields are rising. Ten-year Treasury bond yields fell from a high of 5.2 percent in 2007 to 1.4 percent in July 2012, before reversing course due talk of Fed tapering to today‚Äôs 2.8 percent. Credit Suisse expects yields to head even higher in 2014, partly due to rising inflation expectations. Although analysts expect the Federal Reserve to start reducing its $85 billion in monthly asset purchases come January, they don‚Äôt see any actual Fed rate hikes in the offing, as they believe incoming chairwoman Janet Yellen will tolerate higher inflation to support employment growth. Finally, the fast-growing emerging markets everyone thought would drive global growth are losing their edge over supposedly stodgy developed countries. For starters, the emerging market growth advantage over the developed world should fall from 3.4 percentage points in 2012 to 3 percentage points in 2014 and 2.9 in 2015. The gap is closing partly because developed countries are healthier, which creates problems for emerging markets. What‚Äôs more, impending Fed tapering offers the prospect of increasingly competitive yields in safer environments. And while developed countries went through a painful deleveraging process during the financial crisis, Garthwaite points out, emerging markets did the opposite, and piled on the debt. Private sector debt-to-GDP levels are 10 percentage points above trend in emerging markets and 10 percentage points below trend in developed ones. ‚ÄúAt the very least, there is less scope for leverage-driven growth in the emerging world ‚Äì and it even raises the risk of financial turmoil going forward,‚Äù Garthwaite writes. With all of that in mind, here are seven investment strategies to consider: Go Overweight Equities‚Ä¶  Central bankers usually raise rates when global growth is accelerating. But with inflation either low or falling in most developed economies, there seems little danger of that this time. The European Central Bank just cut rates from 0.5 percent to 0.25 percent, and Credit Suisse expects the Bank of Japan to unleash another large monetary stimulus early next year. The four major central banks won‚Äôt raise rates until wages increase, Garthwaite says, something he doesn‚Äôt expect to happen before 2015. All of that bodes well for stocks as an asset class, as they tend to outperform bonds when growth is accelerating and inflationary pressures are low. What‚Äôs more, even if the Fed isn‚Äôt raising the Fed funds rate, the start of tapering will surely cause a spike in overall rates, which would instantly punish any and all fixed-income holdings. You‚Äôre better off in stocks. ‚Ä¶But Underweight U.S. Equities Relative to Other Global Markets. American stocks tend to do well in times of crisis and underperform their peers in boom times, Garthwaite explains. Investors know it‚Äôs relatively easy for American companies to lay off workers when they need to cut costs and that U.S. policymakers usually act more quickly to counteract economic disasters than their European and Japanese counterparts. Garthwaite points out that the U.S. non-financial stocks carry a 45 percent price-to-book premium over the global peers, near a 12-year high and well above the long-term average of 30 percent. But with the crisis over, he cautions, U.S. equities will likely underperform those in Europe and Japan. Underweight Consumer Staples, Too.  Consumer staples tend to do better than other stocks when global growth is circling the drain. By definition, everyone needs the products the sector‚Äôs firms produce, hard times or not. In fact, consumer staples equity prices tend to follow those of another asset typically regarded as safe: bonds. Although bond prices are currently falling, consumer staples are still priced for turmoil, Garthwaite says. In other words, they‚Äôre expensive. Be Wary of Gold.  A strengthening U.S. dollar should hurt gold prices, which tend to fall as the greenback strengthens. And while some investors use gold as an inflation hedge, it currently appears overpriced relative to both housing and equities. All that said, keep your eyes open. Garthwaite notes that the real federal funds rate is well below 1 percent, a threshold at which gold prices tend to rise. A continuation of easy monetary policy could also support gold prices, as the balance sheets of the four largest central banks are set to grow 16 percent by the end of next year. Set Scandinavian Stocks Aside‚Ä¶ Swedish and Danish equities, as well as the Swiss franc, provided shelter from the chaos in the rest of Europe, Garthwaite says. Now that the circus is winding down, however, they‚Äôre too pricey. ‚Ä¶But Buy Japanese Equities.  Japanese firms have the most to gain from a pickup in global growth because they were unusually vulnerable to the downturn in the first place, Garthwaite says. Rigid Japanese labor laws made it nearly impossible for firms to lay off workers during the financial crisis, but improving growth both at home (an expected 2.2 percent next year, compared to 1.8 percent this year) and around the world should improve margins. In addition, Japan relies heavily on producing machinery and transportation equipment‚Äîthe kinds of things that businesses and governments invest in when times are good. Which they are. Think About Businesses that Benefit from Corporate Spending  In addition to having historically low levels of debt, American corporations are sitting on a cash pile worth nearly 3.4 percent of GDP, compared to a long-term average of 1.2 percent. They‚Äôve been letting that money pile up, Garthwaite says, because of lingering macroeconomic uncertainty. But with confidence increasing and a capital stock older than at any point in the last 43 years, companies could well dust off their checkbooks next year, both in the U.S. and in Europe.
REUTERS/Jason LeeEarlier today, China announced that it would finally loosen its decade old one-child policy. This policy has had a disturbing affect in China in the form of skewed demographics. It's well known that China's population is aging rapidly, causing the workforce to shrink. And without siblings, children are under tremendous financial pressure as they have to care for their own aging parents. But those aren't even the most disturbing trends, wrote BI's Mamta Badkar citing a 2011 report from Nomura. "Perhaps the more alarming concern for population sustainability is the large imbalance between baby girls and boys," wrote the Nomura analysts. Here's more: "Women are bearing only 0.71 girls over their lifetime, well below the replacement figure of just over unity. In 2010, there were 51m more men than woman in the country. The sex ratio among newborns is 120 boys for every 100 girls, the highest in the world (Figure 39). At this rate, there will not be enough brides for as many as one-fifth of today<U+201F>s baby boys when they get to marrying age, heightening the risk of social tensions." Reforms couldn't come soon enough. Nomura

Big news out of China today: The country is loosening its infamous "one-child" policy. It's not eliminating the policy completely. Just creating more loopholes. Why is China doing this? In part because the existing policy has created a demographic/economic problem for the country, which is aging rapidly, even before it gets rich. These two charts from Morgan Stanley from January show how China's demographics are turning in a negative way, and how such turns frequently presage economic weakness.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Almost three months before the botched launch of HealthCare.gov, a U.S. health official expressed frustration with a main contractor working on the website, fearing quality assurance issues could "crash the plane at take-off," according to government documents obtained by Reuters. The documents were released by Republican investigators with the House of†Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee. Republican lawmakers, who have consistently sought to undermine President†Barack Obama's signature health system overhaul, are probing the law's disastrous rollout. Two series of internal emails in July between officials at the Centers for†Medicare†and Medicaid Services (CMS), including HealthCare.gov project manager†Henry Chao, describe struggles with contractors, staff shortages and software problems long before the federal healthcare website crashed on its October 1 launch and threw the rollout of Obamacare into political turmoil. In a July 16 email sent ahead of a meeting with then-prime contractor†CGI Federal, Chao describes the agency's low confidence level in the project work, from constant struggles with releases to changing delivery dates and poor quality assurance on software. "I just need to feel more confident they are not going to crash the plane at take-off," Chao says in the email, which was among several documents the Republican investigators released. Officials at†CGI Federal, the U.S. subsidiary of†Canada's†CGI Group Inc, were not immediately available for comment. In congressional testimony released October 23,†CGI Federal†blamed early website problems on another contractor's software and also said the†federal government†was ultimately responsible for the website's performance. CMS released a statement that did not directly address Chao's email but described the challenging task of building HealthCare.gov. "This is a complex project with a short timeline," CMS said. Chao, the deputy chief information officer at CMS, declined a request to speak directly with Reuters. President†Barack Obama†and administration officials have come under fire for launching a malfunctioning website, but it's not clear if officials knew the extent of the site's problems or when they knew. A day after writing the email about CGI, Chao assured a†House Oversight and Government Reform subcommitteethat HealthCare.gov would be ready on time. It is not known whether Chao learned new information to change his assessment in the intervening hours. On July 20, he distributed a video link to the testimony via email and urged CMS staff to make good on the pledge to lawmakers. "I wanted to share this with you so you can see and hear that both Marilyn and I under oath stated we are going to make October 1," Chao wrote. "I would like you (to) put yourself in my shoes standing before†Congress, which in essence is standing before the American public, and know that you speak the tongue of not necessarily just past truths but the truth that you will make happen." But HealthCare.gov, the†federal government's health insurance marketplace portal for millions of uninsured people in 36 states, crashed shortly after its launch and has been plagued by technical problems even since.

Reuters China held a huge meeting on reform last week, and the details of what was agreed to are finally coming out. For those who read Chinese, the full document is right here. A change to the country's infamous one-child-per-family law is the most headline-grabbing reform. Per Chinese news agency Xinhua, the government is loosening restrictions on its infamous one-child policy, which has been in place for decades. Xinhua Via FT Alphaville, Xinhua has a fuller description of the current law, and how things will change: China will loosen its decades-long one-child population policy, allowing couples to have two children if one of them is an only child, according to a key decision issued on Friday by the Communist Party of China (CPC). China will implement this new policy while adhering to the basic state policy of family planning, according to the decision on major issues concerning comprehensively deepening reforms, which was approved at the Third Plenary Session of the 18th CPC Central Committee held from Nov. 9 to 12 in Beijing. The birth policy will be adjusted and improved step by step to promote ‚Äúlong-term balanced development of the population in China,‚Äù it said. China‚Äôs family planning policy was first introduced in the late 1970s to rein in the surging population by limiting most urban couples to one child and most rural couples to two children, if the first child born was a girl. The policy was later relaxed, with its current form stipulating that both parents must be only children if they are to have a second child. Faisal Islam ‚Äî economics reporter at UK's Channel 4 ‚Äî puts the significance of the policy in perspective.

REUTERS/Jeff J MitchellThe story of falling gas prices is stil just modestly soaking into the media, but it's an important story. Goldman's Kris Dawsey explains what it means: †Retail gasoline prices have declined roughly 40¢/gallon since August, with regular unleaded reaching $3.20/gallon on a national average basis. This has likely been a welcome support for consumer sentiment, given negativity surrounding the recent government shutdown.† It is typical for gasoline prices to decline during this period of the year, with prices usually reaching a seasonal peak in May, declining through the summer and fall, and then hitting a trough in December. On a seasonally-adjusted basis, prices have still fallen, but the recent decline is less striking. In light of the decline in retail gasoline prices over the past year and our projections for 2014, we see a modest positive growth boost in the pipeline, perhaps in the order of one- to two-tenths. This would represent a favorable tailwind, but not a game-changer on the outlook.
REUTERS/Kim Kyung-HoonThe Great Hall of the People, where the Chinese Communist Party plenum is being held, is seen behinds red flags in Tiananmen square in Beijing November 12, 2013.HONG KONG/BEIJING¬†(Reuters) - A document purporting to detail reform plans by¬†China's ruling¬†Communist Party, including liberalizing the prices of resources and reining in some state monopolies, circulated widely on social media on Friday, helping fuel the biggest stock market rally in two months. The document appeared to be a scanned copy of part of a version of a policy statement with annotations on it. It circulated on the Twitter-like social media service Weibo and was passed around widely on the social messaging service WeChat. Reuters was not able to independently verify the authenticity of the document, but market players said that its relatively detailed language on reforms helped fuel a rally in¬†Shanghai¬†and¬†Shenzhen¬†stocks that saw the CSI300 index &lt;.CSI300&gt; post a 2 percent rise amid heavy volume. The¬†Communist Party¬†is widely expected to release a more detailed blueprint for economic reforms early next week, following a more general communiqu√© issued on Tuesday at the close of a plenary session of its elite¬†Central Committee. The relatively vague wording of the communiqu√© had disappointed the market, contributing to a fall of more than 2 percent in the CSI300 index on Wednesday. "The move up today in the A-share market was mainly driven by the leaked draft document that gave people the reform details that were lacking in the initial communiqu√©," said a strategist with a Chinese brokerage, who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to media. Another equity trader at a mid-sized brokerage in¬†Shanghai¬†said: "Compared to the communiqu√© released a few days ago, several factors exceeded expectations. So the market reacted." Calls to the publicity department of the¬†Communist Party¬†were not answered, and there was no immediate response to a faxed request for comment. The document said the government will push reforms on the pricing of water, oil, natural gas, electricity, telecommunications and transportation, and refrain from intervening in the market. The government will push ahead with exchange rate and interest rate reforms, establish a market-driven bond market and open capital markets further, while speeding up moves towards full capital account convertibility, it said. The government will also push reforms to limit various forms of state monopolies. State-owned firms must adapt to market changes, improve their efficiency and engage in fair competition, and exercise more social responsibility, it said. China¬†will encourage more state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to shift towards mixed ownership by bringing in private investors and allowing employees to hold shares in such companies, it added. It included details on giving farmers more property rights and quickening reforms of the current "hukou" or residency system, which currently hinders rural residents from making a full transition to urban dwellers - something that in turn has impeded the country's urbanization efforts. Such restrictions will be lifted in small cities and townships and gradually removed in middle-sized cities, the document said. The language in document was consistent with the overall tone of the communiqu√© issued on Tuesday, in which the party vowed to let the market play a "decisive" role in the economy and said it would create a central working group to push through reforms. Independent of the leak, the official¬†People's Daily¬†published comments by a senior party official on Friday saying the party's reform plan was "unprecedented" in an apparent bid to reassure the market about¬†Beijing's commitment to pushing for change. "Efforts will be unprecedented,"¬†Yang Weimin, vice head of the¬†Office of the Central Leading Group¬†on Finance and Economic Affairs, told¬†the People's Daily¬†in an interview. The leadership approved a "decision on the deepening of comprehensive reforms" in a 20,000-word text covering 15 areas, he said. "When reforms have entered a crucial stage, the deep water, we have to push comprehensive changes in order to deepen reforms," said Yang, who was involved in drafting reform plans.

In his latest note to clients, BTIG's Dan Greenhaus (@danBTIG) puts this amazing 2013 into some perspective. ¬†The S&amp;P 500 is now up 25.5% this year, the Russell 2000 up 31% and the Nasdaq is up 32%. Outside of the nominal returns, the nearly uninterrupted pace of appreciation has caught many off guard. Indeed, in the spring of this year with S&amp;P up by 17% or so, we remarked to CNBC‚Äôs Simon Hobbs that ‚Äúunless this is 1995 all over again, the bulk of the year‚Äôs gains are already in hand.‚Äù We subsequently backed away, raised our S&amp;P price target and, well, the rest is very recent history.

A lost generation of jobless youth in the eurozone could tear the single currency apart if nothing is done to address chronic levels of unemployment, the World Economic Forum (WEF) has warned. ‚ÄúThere is a growing consensus on the fact that unless we address chronic joblessness we will see an escalation in social unrest,‚Äù said S. D. Shibulal , chief executive oof Infosys, who contributed to the WEF's Global Agenda Report. ‚ÄúPeople, particularly the youth, need to be productively employed, or we will witness rising crime rates, stagnating economies and the deterioration of our social fabric,‚Äù he added. John Lipsky, who served as acting managing director of the International Monetary Fund during the height of the Greek crisis in 2011, said the problem was likely to get worse before it got better. He told the Telegraph: "Right now it‚Äôs hard to see any decisive move back the other way at a time in which everyone feels their circumstances are under threat and are worried about their economic future." Mr Lipsky, who contributed to the WEF report, said rigid labour laws meant existing workers were offered more attractive employment rights than their younger counterparts. ‚ÄúWe all know it's true that if it's easier to dismiss a worker when things don‚Äôt work out, that makes you more willing to take a chance on hiring somebody," he said. "I myself have had the experience of finding that restrictive practices make you very reluctant to take on the burden of an employee unless you‚Äôre absolutely sure that you can sustain them.‚Äù He said that while it was viewed as "cruel and heartless" to make it easier for employers to dismiss unproductive workers, relaxing labour laws and fostering greater labour mobility was essential if young workers were to get a "toehold in the economy". He said the rigidity of current laws meant many younger workers were hired on temporary contracts, without the same privileges and job security as permanent employees. The WEF report, which examined ten key issues that would shape the world in 2014, called on governments to work together to tackle the crisis and resist moving towards a protectionist agenda. Mr Shibulal called on governments to equip young people with the skills and training needed to cope with evolving labour market demands. The financial crisis has seen unemployment soar to record highs in some parts of Europe. The jobless rate is currently 26.6pc in Spain, while in Greece, the rate is 27.6pc. However, the youth unemployment rate is as high as 75pc in some parts of Greece. ‚ÄúA generation that starts its career in complete hopelessness will be more prone to populist politics and will lack the fundamental skills that one develops early on in their career," the report said. "This can undermine the future of European integration as the countries with the highest youth unemployment rate are on the periphery.‚Äù Meanwhile, the WEF report also warned of a rising lack of confidence in economic policies, caused by the impact of the financial crisis. A survey by the Pew Research Center found that 99pc of Greek respondents to its attitudes survey felt the situation in their country was bad. This compares to 83pc of UK respondents and just 10pc in China. Meanwhile, 95pc of Greeks said the economics system in their country favoured the wealthy, compared with 60pc of Americans and 44pc of Australians. "People put too much belief in policymakers‚Äô ability to heal the crisis," said Mr Lipsky, who currently works at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. ‚ÄúThe weakness of the recovery suggested that policymakers were either feckless or powerless." The report also said tensions in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) would be high on the global agenda next year. Cyber threats and Asia‚Äôs growing middle class were also cited among the ten trends, as was widening income disparities. 
FX / Sons of AnarchyHere are some acerbic comments from SocGen FX strategist Kit Juckes on the current world of "Central Bank Anarchy" as he puts it in an email to clients. †Once upon a time, we had a whole array of rules to help think about monetary policy -the Phillips curve, NAIRU, the Taylor Rule, even MV=PY (an identity not a rule) and Goodhart's Law (that anything a central bank targets will mis-behave like a moody teenager). But increasingly, central bankers are throwing away their playbook. In the UK and US, unemployment rate triggers chosen to frame forward policy guidance are set to be revised because they will be reached before the central banks are ready to raise rates. Even at the ECB, there is acknowledgment that the link between economic activity and inflation has ëbecome more tenuous in recent years'.††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††††† I was thinking about this as I listened to Mr Carney at the BOE Inflation Report press conference and as I watched Yellen's Confirmation Hearing for the Fed Chair yesterday. When I read Jeremy Warner in the Telegraph this morning expressing concern about the way politicians have effectively handed over the reins of macroeconomic policy-making to central bankers. I can't help thinking that we have put our faith in people who are ëwinging it'. There's a flipside view to all this, which is simply that the world's central banks have a longstanding interest in two things: Low unemployment and stable prices. And nowhere is that still being achieved. So the ongoing improvisation is what's required of them. In the meantime, markets are in the sweetspot, and are loving this "anarchy" as day in and day out, they're comforted by a global economy that offers few threats while also few reasons for central banks to tighten policy.
Bryan Bedder/GettyMarkets are pretty quiet right now. Europe is down a little bit. US futures are up a little bit (naturally). But stocks turned in a strong session in Asia. Shanghai ended the day up 1.7%. Japan ended up 1.95%, as the Nikkei went above the 15,000 threshold. Korea rallied 2%. World markets truly do feel like they're in a goldilocks stage. There are few obvious risks to the world economy, and yet there's this meme (which may be valid) that all of the world's central banks are in the mode for further easing. So, party time.
