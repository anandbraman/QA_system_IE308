REUTERS / Shamil Zhumatov It's party-time on spaceship Nursultan. KAZAKHSTAN'S capital, Astana, celebrated its 15th anniversary on July 6th with a petrodollar-fuelled party. It happened also to be the 73rd birthday of the country's strongman president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, who commissioned this epitome of surreal bombast rising from the Central Asian steppe. During the festivities, crowds gathered around Astana's architectural landmarks as the president's graven image gazed benevolently down from a bas-relief on a high white column meant to represent the country emerging from the ashes of the Soviet Union. Mr Nazarbayev has ruled this state of 17m people, scattered over a territory the size of Western Europe, with an iron fist. He is one of only two Central Asian leaders to have been in power since before the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991. Islam Karimov, next door in Uzbekistan, is the other. (They loathe each other.) Without Mr Nazarbayev, Astana would not exist. In 1997 it replaced leafy Almaty, 750 miles (1,200km) to the south near the Chinese border, as Kazakhstan's capital (though Almaty remains the bigger city). In the days when oil prices were high, the president decreed that a space-age metropolis would rise from the marshy land on the left bank of the Yesil river. The city bakes in summer and plunges to -40Â°C in winter. For the president, Astana is the site for flights of architectural fancy as extreme as the continental climate. The capital is meant both to awe his adoring public and to beam soft power across the Central Asian steppe where Kazakhstan, as the economic powerhouse, has pretensions to regional leadership. Astana has all the weirdness of Pyongyang and little of the human scale of Canberra. It is a collection of monuments and boulevards on a scale that screams "L'Ã©tat, c'est moi". The president surveys his city from his marble-clad, blue-and-gold-domed palace. The jewel in Astana's crown is usually reckoned to be a Norman Foster pyramid, the Palace of Peace and Accord. It flashes neon at night, houses an academy of Turkic studies and is supposed to promote reconciliation among the world's religions. It is one of several buildings that displays Mr Nazarbayev's obsession for hosting conventions, expositions and conferences. A study in Asian authoritarian kitsch is provided by the Bayterek tower, which is meant to represent a poplar tree holding the golden egg of the Samruk, the mythical bird of Kazakh happiness. On the observation deck, 100 metres (330 feet) above ground, visitors may lay their hand in the gilded imprint of the president's and make a wish. More visually pleasing is the Khan Shatyr ("the Khan's Marquee"), a vast transparent tent made of space-age fabric. Meant to echo the nomads that exist no more, the 35-acre (14-hectare) site houses, among other things, a shopping mall and a beach resort. It is where Mr Nazarbayev held a lavish 70th-birthday bash. The ruler is a modern-day khan himself, with a thriving cult industry. He is immortalised in statues, in films and in print as a children's fairy-tale hero. He rules Kazakhstan as a one-man show, rigging elections, muzzling the media and brooking no opposition. Yet Western leaders beat a path to his door. Britain's prime minister, David Cameron, was in Astana this month drumming up business. A former British prime minister, Tony Blair, has a consultancy contract as Mr Nazarbayev's sultan of spin. The president longs for the Nobel peace prize. He is no crude dictator. He has a popular touch, and many Kazakhstanis like the political stability and rising living standards his regime supplies. Elsewhere in the region, both are in short supply. Yet, in one of the world's top 20 oil producers, the dollars are not trickling down to everyone. In late 2011 a growing gulf between haves and have-nots came into focus when security forces opened fire on striking oil workers in the western energy hub of Zhanaozen, killing 15. The turmoil erupted just as Mr Nazarbayev was opening his latest architectural indulgence in Astana, an arch marking Kazakhstan's 20th year of independence. The contrast between Astana's spaceship cityscape and the shabby streets of Zhanaozen, with their crumbling, Soviet-era, rabbit-hutch housing, could hardly be greater. Astana's name could scarcely be more mundane: it means "capital" in Kazakh. Yet its Persian derivation has connotations of a "royal porte", and the widespread belief among Kazakhstanis is that the city will one day be renamed Nursultan, after the man who had it built. Mr Nazarbayev has modestly rejected such an idea, but does not appear to mind his capital assuming his name after he is gone. It must be the second best thing to being immortal.

A few weeks ago, we found a video undermining Rick Santelli's claim that his complaints about Fed easing "were never about inflation."Â  If you need more proof, a reader has sent us the following clip from 2009 in which Santelli warned inflation would be "stunning" (start at 4:20):  So if his argument was never Â inflation, what did it concern? In the aforementioned segment (an exchange with WSJ's Jon Hilsenrath), Santelli said his main concern had always been "gyrations ... in foreign exchange programs." Today, Paul Krugman completely dismisses that fear, in a post titled: "Fish in a Barrel, Rick Santelli Edition." He looks at the dollar's movement against major currencies, as expressed in the following chart: FRED It's true that the dollar fell sharply at the beginning of 2009, but this was as a result of the crisis fading, and the safe-haven bid coming out of the dollar (a good thing). As for the real meat of the argument, here's Krugman: See how stable the dollar was before the Fed starting QE? See how much it has plunged since? Neither do I. Not exactly gyrations.
dno1967b via www.flickr.com creative commonsBOOKS on business leadership often fail to catch readers' attention because they sugarcoat incompetence, the single most intriguing characteristic of many successful careers. This is a pity, because the people at the core of these books are often excellent subjects for study by people other than their miserable underlings. Bob Lutz's "Icons and Idiots" provides a template for a better approach. Over a long career he worked in senior positions for BMW, Ford, Chrysler and General Motors (twice). This gives him a unique vantage point when trying to explain why the car industry, which benefited from a huge domestic market in America, needed a bail-out: it was run by petty tyrants unworthy to be in charge of a lemonade stand, let alone a vast industry. Mr Lutz leavens his criticism with brief praise at the end of each appraisal, which can be ignored, or by finding virtue in character flaws, which should not be. Consider the flattery applied to his first boss at GM: "Bob Wachtler was not without a sense of humour, however racist, sexist, homophobic and speciesist it may have been." Wachtler's best feature was his ability to speak clearly: "Many times I would hear him shout," Mr Lutz writes, 'I read your stupid memo, and it's clear to me that you don't get it. I can't waste my time explaining it all again, so just rewrite the f--ing thing, and this time, recommend approval'." At least Wachtler knew something about cars and cared about producing them. Mr Lutz describes his next boss, a senior official at GM Europe, as follows: "From his lower lip, a smooth curve of ruddy fat arced gracefully down to his shirt collar." His greatest virtue, it becomes clear, is that he was too dysfunctional to undermine the people he was supposed to manage. Mr Lutz was not so fortunate in subsequent assignments. Harold (Red) Poling, a famous Ford executive, was so thoroughly obsessed with cost controls that he wrecked the market for a well-timed small truck by withholding critical funds to correct flaws in its engine. His rationale: the flaws would become obvious only after the warranty expired, thus sparing the company the cost of making repairs. Philip Caldwell, the first non-Ford to run Ford, was obsessed with senseless detail and acquiring free soap and jam from company hotels. Yes, he cared about quality, but only after reading Mr Lutz's book does that appear to be a novel, rather than inevitable, virtue. If "Icons and Idiots" suffers from a flaw, it is the difficulty of mocking the foibles of an industry whose failures so damage society. An offsetting virtue, and why even pessimists might be reassured by this book, is that it proves how bad luck was, at most, just a minor difficulty compared with the problems that were wholly self-inflicted.

Ed Giles/Getty Images Despite the chaos, the blood and the democratic setbacks, this is a long process. Do not give up hope. ROUGHLY two-and-a-half years after the revolutions in the Arab world, not a single country is yet plainly on course to become a stable, peaceful democracy. The countries that were more hopeful--Tunisia, Libya and Yemen--have been struggling. A chaotic experiment with democracy in Egypt, the most populous of them, has landed an elected president behind bars. Syria is awash with the blood of civil war. No wonder some have come to think the Arab spring is doomed. The Middle East, they argue, is not ready to change. One reason is that it does not have democratic institutions, so people power will decay into anarchy or provoke the reimposition of dictatorship. The other is that the region's one cohesive force is Islam, which--it is argued--cannot accommodate democracy. The Middle East, they conclude, would be better off if the Arab spring had never happened at all. That view is at best premature, at worst wrong. Democratic transitions are often violent and lengthy. The worst consequences of the Arab spring--in Libya initially, in Syria now--are dreadful. Yet as our special report argues, most Arabs do not want to turn the clock back. Those who say that the Arab spring has failed ignore the long winter before, and its impact on people's lives. In 1960 Egypt and South Korea shared similar life-expectancy and GDP per head. Today they inhabit different worlds. Although many more Egyptians now live in cities and three-quarters of the population is literate, GDP per head is only a fifth of South Korea's. Poverty and stunting from malnutrition are far too common. The Muslim Brotherhood's brief and incompetent government did nothing to reverse this, but Egypt's deeper problems were aggravated by the strongmen who preceded them. And many other Arab countries fared no better. This matters, because, given the Arab spring's uneven progress, many say the answer is authoritarian modernisation: an Augusto Pinochet, Lee Kuan Yew or Deng Xiaoping to keep order and make the economy grow. Unlike South-East Asians, the Arabs can boast no philosopher-king who has willingly nurtured democracy as his economy has flourished. Instead, the dictator's brothers and the first lady's cousins get all the best businesses. And the despots--always wary of stirring up the masses--have tended to duck the big challenges of reform, such as gradually removing the energy subsidies that in Egypt alone swallow 8% of GDP. Even now the oil-rich monarchies are trying to buy peace; but as an educated and disenfranchised youth sniffs freedom, the old way of doing things looks ever more impossible, unless, as in Syria, the ruler is prepared to shed vast amounts of blood to stay in charge. Some of the more go-ahead Arab monarchies, for example in Morocco, Jordan and Kuwait, are groping towards constitutional systems that give their subjects a bigger say. Fine, some will reply, but Arab democracy merely leads to rule by the Islamists, who are no more capable of reform than the strongmen, and thanks to the intolerance of political Islam, deeply undemocratic. Muhammad Morsi, the Muslim Brother evicted earlier this month by the generals at the apparent behest of many millions of Egyptians in the street, was democratically elected, yet did his best to flout the norms of democracy during his short stint as president. Many secular Arabs and their friends in the West now argue that because Islamists tend to regard their rule as God-given, they will never accept that a proper democracy must include checks, including independent courts, a free press, devolved powers and a pluralistic constitution to protect minorities. This too, though, is wrong. Outside the Arab world, Islamists--in Malaysia and Indonesia, say--have shown that they can learn the habit of democracy. In Turkey too, the protests against the autocratic but elected prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, have more in common with Brazil than the Arab spring. Turkey, for all its faults, is more democratic today than it was when the army lurked in the background. The problem, then, is with Arab Islamists. That is hardly surprising. They have been schooled by decades of repression, which their movements survived only by being conspiratorial and organised. Their core supporters are a sizeable minority in most Arab countries. They cannot be ignored, and must instead be absorbed into the mainstream. That is why Egypt's coup is so tragic. Had the Muslim Brotherhood remained in power, they might have learned the tolerance and pragmatism needed for running a country. Instead, their suspicions about democratic politics have been confirmed. Now it is up to Tunisia, the first of the Arab countries to throw off the yoke of autocracy, to show that Arab Islamists can run countries decently. It might just do that: it is on its way to getting a constitution that could serve as the basis of a decent, inclusive democracy. If the rest of the Arab world moves in that direction, it will take many years to do so. That would not be surprising, for political change is a long game. Hindsight tends to smooth over the messy bits of history. The transition from communism, for instance, looks easy in retrospect. Yet three years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, Europe was overrun by criminal mafias; extremist politicians were prominent in Poland, Slovakia and the Baltics; the Balkans were about to degenerate into war and there was fighting in Georgia. Even now, most people in the old Soviet bloc live under repressive regimes--yet few want to go back. The Arab spring was always better described as an awakening: the real revolution is not so much in the street as in the mind. The internet, social media, satellite television and the thirst for education--among Arab women as much as men--cannot co-exist with the deadening dictatorships of old. Egyptians, among others, are learning that democracy is neither just a question of elections nor the ability to bring millions of protesters onto the street. Getting there was always bound to be messy, even bloody. The journey may take decades. But it is still welcome. Click here to subscribe to The Economist

Seeking a second term asÂ New JerseyÂ governor with a possible eye to a White House run in 2016,Â Chris ChristieÂ is heavily touting his business record, as he did at the ribbon cutting of real estate firmÂ Realogy's new corporate headquarters in Madison, N.J., last month. "We made a commitment from the beginning to growÂ New Jersey's economy. The only way to do that is with the private sector," Christie said. Christie often points to his administration's "partnership" with business, including deregulation, tax cuts and incentives. (Read More:Â Worst States for Business) That year and in 2011, New Jersey finished 30th overall. In 2012, the state plunged to 41st. For 2013, it drops another spot to 42nd. To some degree, the Garden State is a victim of a changing competitive landscape, as well as a business culture embedded in the state long before Christie took over. But our study shows Christie's efforts to change New Jersey have largely been unsuccessful compared to other states. With more states than ever touting their low Cost of Doing Business, that criterion carries extra weight in ourÂ study this year. That puts old, Northeastern states like New Jersey at an instant disadvantage. Indeed, the state comes in 42nd in that key category. (Read More:Â America's Most Expensive States to Live) New JerseyÂ is quite simply one of the most expensive states to do business in. Office and industrial rents are expensive, wages are high. And with a corporate income tax rate of 9 percent on top of soaring property taxes, New Jersey has one of the highest tax burdens in the country. Christie has made a broad tax cut plan a centerpiece of his re-election campaign. But it is not just New Jersey's tax rates that are a problem. The Tax Foundation'sScott DrenkardÂ tells CNBC New Jersey's tax system suffers from some fairness issues. The already high taxes are levied on a narrow base. "Some businesses are paying full freightâ€”paying the full rate, and other businesses that are engaging in favorable activities are paying low rates," Drenkard said. (Read More:Â States Bring Renewed Swagger to Top States 2013) That unevenness in the New Jersey tax code is a direct result of a major push by Christie to boost business incentives. The state now offers at least five different corporate tax reduction programs, and Christie has awarded some $2.1 billion in subsidies since taking office compared with $1.25 billion in the prior 10 years, according toÂ New Jersey Policy Perspective, a liberal think tank. The incentives have helped Christie secure some victories, such as the Realogy corporate headquarters. The firm had reportedly been considering a move out of the state. AndÂ AllerganÂ opened a 93,000 square foot research facility in Bridgewater in September, after reportedly considering locations inÂ California,PennsylvaniaÂ andNorth Carolina. But incentives alone have not been enough to bring New Jersey in line with the national recovery. Unemployment remained above the national average at 8.6 percent in May, and the state's economy was growing at about half the national rate. Christie vowed to make his broader tax cut proposal a campaign issue after failing to pass a tax credit plan in the latest budget. Opponents argued there was not enough revenue to justify the tax cuts. (Read More:Â Categories &amp; Criteria for CNBC's Top States for Business 2013) On hisÂ campaign website, Christie claims he has already cut "$2.35 billion in job-destroying taxes." And he claims he is making New Jersey more business friendly. "The Governor has also eliminated hundreds of confusing rules and regulations that put an onerous and unnecessary burden on New Jersey businesses," the site said. New Jersey does log a solid improvement in our Business Friendliness category for 2013, but still finishes near the bottom at 41st in the category compared with 48th in 2012. The libertarianÂ Fraser InstituteÂ gives New Jersey below average marks for the fairness of its tax system, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Institute for Legal Reform's annualÂ rankingÂ of state lawsuit climates puts New Jersey at 32nd. New Jersey has a long tradition as a heavily unionized state, and Christieâ€”perhaps bowing to political realitiesâ€”has been courting many private sector unions in his re-election campaign. (Read More:Â States Battle for Business) A heavy union presence tends to work against states in our Workforce category, and Census figures show New Jersey remains among the most unionized states in the nation. But the state finishes a respectable 21st in the category this year compared with 28th last year. The higher than average unemployment rate means more workers are available, and many of them are well-educated and trained. New Jersey workers are among the most educated in the country, according to the Census Bureau. And speaking ofÂ education, New Jersey surges to the No. 1 spot in our Education category for the first time, up from fourth place last year. Class sizes are low, the state generously supports its public schools, and high school test scores are among the best in the country. For a politically ambitious governor whose state has typically struggled in our Top States rankings, that could be a small silver lining.

US fuel prices continue to rise. August NYMEX gasoline futures price cleared $3 a couple of days ago and is now at the highest level for 2013. This introduces two new challenges for the US economy: 1. Fuel prices tend to influence consumer sentiment and spending. The sentiment is not necessarily linked to how much consumers actually spend on fuel.  Rather, it's connected to the psychology of seeing a sudden spike in this index that most Americans see on a daily basis.  And improvements in US consumer sentiment have already stalled recently. Sober LookNYMEX RBOB price chart From Bloomberg: The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary index of consumer sentiment decreased to 83.9 in July from 84.1 the month prior, today’s report showed. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey called for a gain to 84.7. The gauge reached an almost six-year high of 84.5 in May.  The recent increases in mortgage rates and prices at the gas pump may have restrained consumers’ views on the economy in the next six months. This result is supported by another indicator, the Gallup U.S. Economic Confidence Index. Gallup: - ... U.S. Economic Confidence Index was -9 for the week ending July 7, on par with scores from the past month. The index has been slightly lower since reaching a five-year weekly high of -3 in late May and early June. Still, confidence has generally improved from levels Gallup has measured over the past five years. The relatively lower levels of confidence in June and early July may be a result of more volatility in U.S. stock prices and a stubborn unemployment rate. While consumer confidence remains near post-recession highs, the recent slowdown in improvements could become exacerbated by rising fuel costs in July. 2. Today we've seen the producer price index unexpectedly move up due to higher energy costs. USA Today: - A big jump in gasoline prices pushed wholesale inflation up in June by the largest amount in nine months. But underlying inflation showed only a modest gain.  Wholesale prices rose 0.8% in June compared with May when prices had risen 0.5%, the Labor Department reported Friday. It was the biggest gain since a 1% jump in September and was driven by a 7.2% surge in gasoline prices. Keep in mind they are talking about June gasoline prices in this report. Now take a look at the chart above and compare it to the levels for July. It doesn't bode well for the July headline PPI number, which could begin to eat into corporate margins.
Although the stock market has responded in a highly positive way to Bernanke’s statement of Fed policy, little has really changed, and the effects are likely to be temporary.  What set the market on fire was the Chairman’s statement that “a highly accommodative Fed policy for the foreseeable future is what is needed for the U.S. economy.”  As we explain below, however, this declaration, when examined closely, is essentially a reiteration of what he has previously stated. Bernanke has always maintained that a reduction of the amount of Fed bond buying did not constitute a tightening of policy since they would still be adding to the Fed’s balance and that this was stimulative despite the reduction. He had also emphasized previously that the bond buying program and the fed funds rate policy were not the same and that the fed funds rate would continue to be kept near zero indefinitely, or as long as needed.  The Chairman’s current statement did not alter these views.  He merely stated that policy would remain highly accommodative, basically repeating his previous views.  The important point is that nowhere in his speech or answers did he retract his previous view that tapering of the bond buying program could occur later in the year, which is what spooked the market earlier. That Bernanke chose at this time to emphasize a different aspect of the Fed’s policy is no surprise.  As we stated in prior comments, he was probably shocked by the bond market’s initial negative reaction to a second half pullback in bond purchases that threatened to reverse everything he’s been trying to do over the past three years.  Both he and other Fed members gave a series of speeches over the last few weeks that failed to stem the tide until yesterday’s statement.  Even then, long-term Treasury yields only declined by a small fraction of their sudden rise, thereby threatening the ongoing housing recovery. Furthermore, the FOMC minutes of their last meeting, released a few hours before Bernanke’s speech, gave a much more muddled picture of the members’ thinking.  In attempting to summarize the differing opinions of various Fed members, the summary used qualifiers such as “one member”, “two members”, “another member”, “a few members”, “a couple of members”, “several members”, “some members”, “many members”, and “most members”. In sum, it is apparent that there is an unusual lack of agreement among the various members about future policy. In our view, the economy remains too sluggish to reduce the bond buying program anytime soon.  GDP was up only 1.8% in the first quarter and looks even weaker in the second.  With release of the latest wholesale inventory numbers, many economists have reduced their second quarter growth rate to 1% or below.  In addition, the wheels seem to be coming off the economies of Southern Europe, increasing the likelihood of another imminent debt crisis.  Chinese exports, the key driver of the economy, dropped 3% from a year earlier, the first negative reading since November 2009.  The decline reflected lower exports to the U.S., Europe and Japan.  Despite the decline, Premier Li stated that he would not stimulate, and would emphasize long-term structural changes, indicating that he may allow short-term softness in the economy.  In sum, we think that the reduction in the Fed’s bond-buying program will come later rather than sooner.  But contrary to current market opinion, we think this will be highly negative for stocks as it means a disappointing U.S. and global economy and sharp downward revisions in earnings estimates.
