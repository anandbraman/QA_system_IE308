Thomson ReutersLogo of Deutsche Bank AG is seen in TokyoBy Supriya Kurane (Reuters) - The New York banking regulator is investigating if Deutsche Bank and Barclays Plc used algorithms on their trading platforms to manipulate foreign exchange rates, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. Benjamin Lawsky, the head of New York's Department of Financial Services (DFS), has ordered a monitor to be installed at Deutsche Bank and already has one in place at Barclays - a move that will allow him to collect greater evidence of alleged manipulation, said the source who did not want to be named. Deutsche Bank spokeswoman Renee Calabro declined to comment but cited an earlier statement on the probes. "Deutsche Bank has received requests for information from regulatory authorities that are investigating trading in the foreign exchange market. The Bank is cooperating with those investigations," Calabro said, quoting the earlier statement. Representatives at Barclays did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment outside regular business hours. A DFS spokesman declined to comment. Last month, regulators fined six major banks a total of $4.3 billion for failing to stop traders from trying to manipulate the foreign exchange market, following a yearlong global investigation. Deutsche Bank and Barclays were not among the six banks. Lawsky, who started his probe into possible manipulation of currency markets in February, chose not to coordinate a settlement with other regulators because he viewed those deals as too weak, a source told Reuters last month, an indication he's likely to go after the banks later and demand larger penalties. Reuters reported last month that the civil settlements struck between six global banks and U.S. and UK authorities set the stage for negotiations over related ongoing probes that could bear much more severe consequences.

New York (AFP) - Goldman Sachs, Wall Street's biggest dealmaker, has surpassed $1 trillion in mergers and acquisitions for a single year for the first time since the financial crisis. The US investment bank passed the closely-watched benchmark for 2014 following transactions this week, according to data Wednesday from Dealogic.  The last time a firm surpassed $1 trillion in a year came in 2007, when Goldman also breached the level.  Goldman's latest big deal was Merck's $9.5 billion takeover of Cubist Pharmaceuticals, unveiled Monday. Goldman has also worked on the $66 billion purchase of Botox-maker Allergan by Activis and the $48.5 billion acquisition by AT&amp;T of DirecTV. With 380 deals worth just over $1.0 trillion, Goldman leads the pack in global mergers and acquisitions, according to Dealogic.  JPMorgan Chase ranks second with $741 billion in deals and Morgan Stanley is third with $692 billion in deals. Barclays is the highest ranked non-US firm with $540 billion in deals, the data show The ranking does not include data for initial public offerings, an area in which Goldman is also active.   FREE AppDownload

REUTERS/Mike Blake">Thomson ReutersA Merrill Lynch building is shown in downtown San Diego, CaliforniaBy Jed Horowitz NEW YORK (Reuters) - Merrill Lynch told its 14,000 brokers on Wednesday they will get higher bonus payments in 2015 for attracting new clients and assets but eliminated pay for servicing clients with less than $250,000. The brokerage subsidiary of Bank of America Corp  will pay brokers .10 percent of new assets clients use to buy loans, banking and trust products, or put into fee-based advisory accounts. The cash bonus - half paid at yearend and half over eight years - doubles the .05 percent paid this year for such "strategic" money. Brokers attracting over $10 million of such assets get .20 percent and .23 percent for those reaching $50 million. However, bonuses in 2015 are being halved for new money put into low-profit money-market or bank accounts. Brokerage executives and headhunters scrutinize annual changes in compensation at top firms to assess how they may attract or repel new brokers and retain veterans. Merrill's emphasis on bank products could be risky, one said, because the firm has lost brokers and been criticized for bending its traditionally broker-centric culture to the parent bank's norms. "The number one reason people are leaving is the persistent pressure to 'BankofAmericanize' Merrill brokers," said Ron Eddie, president of Millennium Career Advisors. Merrill's strategy "to retain, strengthen and acquire clients and advisers is working and remains unchanged," said spokeswoman Susan McCabe. The clients being retained are changing, however. Three years ago Merrill eliminated pay for new households with less than $250,000 but "grandfathered" existing small accounts. It will now pay nothing on the grandfathered accounts, which comprised about 1 percent of client assets, or $20 billion, Merrill brokerage head John Thiel told Reuters last summer. In one exception, Merrill will pay brokers 20 percent of the fees and commissions collected from sub-$250,000 accounts if wealthier clients comprise at least 80 percent of their "client book." Merrill brokers who bring in at least two new eligible households, however, will receive a bonus of .15 percent of the new assets next year - triple the 2014 bonus. If they combine two new households with new strategic assets above $10 million, they collect .30 percent of the assets. Brokers' core pay is not changing in 2015. They will collect between about 20 percent to 48 percent of the fees and commissions clients pay Merrill, with higher producers getting the higher payouts.    (Reporting By Jed Horowitz.

Alister Doyle/ReutersA fishing boat enters the harbour at the Arctic port of Svolvaer in northern Norway March 4, 2013.New oil projects are being scrapped in Norway amid falling production and low oil prices.  Long held up as the model for managing oil abundance, Norway has painstakingly sought to prevent the problems that occur with other natural resource-based economies, such as corruption, slow economic growth, currency appreciation, and subsequently, deindustrialization.  Since 1990, Norway has diverted much of its oil earnings to a sovereign wealth fund, which has become the world's largest. The money, reaching $890 billion as of June 2014, amounts to $178,000 for every Norwegian citizen. The sovereign wealth fund helps Norway avoid some of the problems associated with the "resource curse" by investing capital abroad. But more importantly, the money is set aside to be saved and invested to help the country plan for the eventual decline of oil production, with the intention of transitioning to a more diversified economy that can take oil's place.   The early cracks in Norway's petrol-based economy are beginning to show, perhaps quicker than many predicted.   Energy analysts have explored in detail how the ongoing decline in oil prices – down 40 percent since June – might affect oil exporting countries like Russia, Iran, Venezuela, and other OPEC members. But even Norway, the model for using natural resources to build a modern wealthy economy, is not immune to the price fall.  Statoil, the mostly government-owned oil company, has seen its share price cut in half since July 2014. It is idling several offshore rigs as oil prices drop. Three rigs – the COSL Pioneer, Scarabeo 5, and Songa Trym – will be suspended until the middle of 2015 because of lower profitability. "These measures are necessary due to the overcapacity of rigs compared to the assignments we are prioritising. This situation is unfortunate, and we are doing what we can to minimise the extent of the suspensions," Statoil procurement head Jon Arnt Jacobsen said in a statement.  To make matters worse, costs of developing new fields have been steadily rising. "The boom is probably over. But we're not looking at a steep decline in investment or production," Norway's oil minister Tord Lien told Reuters in May 2014. "The costs are rising too high and too fast. The Norwegian costs have risen a little bit more than elsewhere." Since those comments, oil prices have tumbled. Norway may in fact see a steep decline in investment.  Lower oil prices could force more than $150 billion worth of investments to be put on hold worldwide, according to an assessment by Norwegian firm Rystad Energy. Statoil is deferring a decision on investing $5.74 billion in the Snorre field, an offshore oil project in the Norwegian Sea. Also, Statoil's Johan Castberg field, an estimated $16-$19 billion oil field in the Barents Sea, will be tabled for the time being. These costly projects won't generate a sufficient return given today's prices.  ReutersMap of the Arctic locating Norway's Jan Mayen Island. Locates planned or active energy facilities and regions with high probability of oil and gas reserves.But the oil price decline is only accelerating a trend that is already underway. Even with high oil prices Norway was facing a tougher future due to years of waning oil production. Since 2001, Norway's oil production has fallen by almost half, from around 3.5 million barrels per day down to about 1.8 or 1.9 million bpd in 2014.   The decline in investment is already pinching the labor market. Around 10,000 Norwegian oil workers have been laid off as the industry pares back spending, accounting for 10 percent of the sector's total workforce, the Wall Street Journal reports. Oil workers are threatening to strike unless the government steps in to stem further losses.  And the way forward is murky. Despite its best efforts, Norway's economy is overwhelmingly dependent on oil, which accounts for more than half of the country's exports. Other export industries have struggled to develop as costs are too high – a classic symptom felt in countries suffering from the resource curse.  But resuscitating the sector may be difficult. With such a high cost environment, it doesn't make sense for many companies in Norway to invest in new projects. Spending could drop by another 18 percent next year as project economics look poor.  Conversely, without investment, new production will not materialize in the coming years, leading to further deterioration for the sector as existing fields age and decline.  To be sure, Norway has its almost $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund to fall back on, so it is not as if its citizenry will be thrust into poverty anytime soon. Still, Norway may need to begin building a post-oil economy sooner than it thought.  FREE AppDownload
Live Stream / CFA InstituteAswath DamodaranWhen it comes to valuing stocks, the most reliable valuations come from imaginative number crunchers and disciplined storytellers, says Aswath Damodaran. And too often pure “numbers” people drift off into what he calls “spreadsheet nirvana.” Similarly, investors who focus purely on the narrative of a potential investment run the risk of quickly “veering from reality to fantasy.” Damodaran, who teaches valuation and corporate finance at the Stern School of Business at New York University (NYU), made these remarks at the recent CFA Institute Equity Research and Valuation Conference 2014 in Boston, where he urged attendees to bridge the gap between numbers and narratives, insisting that the best valuations are not just “a collection of numbers, but a story connected to numbers.” Damodaran acknowledged the critical role that numbers play in the valuation process, but he warned that they should be used judiciously. Due to mission creep, he thinks accounting statements have become increasingly difficult to navigate and fair value accounting has become an oxymoron, allowing for bias and the illusion of objectivity in valuations. Similarly, the emergence of Big Data as an input into sophisticated valuation models driven by “Excel Ninjas,” and the accompanying notion that “more is better,” has its limits. Adding an extra decimal place to your model’s projected operating profit margin conveys a false sense of precision with no meaningful improvement in outcomes. Analysts who focus solely on the numbers are unlikely to convince skeptics or potential investors if they have no compelling narrative. They also risk missing internal inconsistencies (that “spreadsheet nirvanna” where trees grow to the sky and margins expand forever). For Damodaran, every number in an analyst’s model should have a story behind it. If Benjamin Graham and David Dodd’s Security Analysis is the quintessential playbook for number crunchers, Damodaran suggested that storytellers look to Philip Fisher’s Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits and Other Writings for similar guidance. Humans are wired to be more receptive to stories than numbers, and in investing the ability to make a persuasive case for a stock’s valuation is critically important. “Stories connect with people while numbers don’t,” said Damodaran. Narratives generally work best with start-up firms but they can also be effective with special situations and turnaround stories. If left unchecked, however, storytellers can quickly wind up in “fantasyland,” according to Damodaran. This happens when a narrative-based valuation is not sufficiently supported by numbers. Without numbers, storytellers also have no way to measure whether the narrative is holding up over time. Damodaran prescribed a six-step process for bridging the gap between narratives and numbers and generating more reliable valuations. In sum, numbers and narratives are essential elements to an effective valuation. And number crunchers and storytellers are both prone to operating in an echo chamber, where their assumptions go unchallenged. Those who manage to bridge the gap between number crunching and storytelling are more apt to find success as investors. FREE AppDownload
Last Friday night, I attended the Bloomberg BusinessWeek 85th Anniversary Dinner. The party was held at the American Museum of Natural History, where Seth Meyers, the former Saturday Night Live star, hosted the evening beneath a massive, life-sized replica of a blue whale. The party was packed with the usual collection of highly polished New York media and business types. (The entertainment highlight of the night for me was a charming duet by Lady Gaga and Tony Bennett.) It was a great honor to be asked by Bloomberg and BusinessWeek to give an official toast during the event, along with my fellow toastmasters Henry Kissinger, Henry Kravis, and Melody Hobson. For my toast, I was asked to select the innovation that I thought created the most disruptive change during the last 85 years. I decided to speak about the microchip—because the microchip may well replace the human race. Yes, I’m being intentionally provocative here: but it isn’t just because of my nickname (“Dr. Doom”) that I’ve chosen to find the dark shadow in the silver lining of technical progress. A few weeks ago, Stephen Hawking, the greatest astrophysicist of our time, gave a provocative speech of his own: Hawking suggested that humans should start thinking about colonizing other planets, because eventually artificial intelligence and robots will replace the human race. It may sound crazy now—but what seems crazy today may not sound so crazy 25, 50, or 100 years from now. Nouriel Roubini This wave of technological innovation began in 1947 with the invention of the transistor. A little over 10 years later, the microchip appeared; and, soon after that, computers followed. From these basic roots, the rate of innovation simply exploded. We now live in a digital age where personal computers, supercomputers, robotics, and artificial intelligence are everyday features of our world. All of these new labor-saving technologies are cheap to deploy—and each will likely play a role in further automating and digitizing our economy. Without further ado, let’s take a look ahead to what many are calling the Third Industrial Revolution. Nouriel RoubiniLooking back as 2014 winds to a close, I see that a lot has changed in the world economy this year. For example, there is a new perception of the role of technology. Innovators and tech CEOs both seem positively giddy with optimism. And while it is true that some wondrous opportunities may lie ahead, there are also dangers to be wary of as we look to the future. Technologists claim that the world is on the cusp of a series of major technical breakthroughs. The excitement in this sector isn’t coming just from information technology. It’s also being generated in the fields of biotechnology, energy technology, nanotechnology, and especially from the manufacturing technologies of robotics and automation. These new manufacturing technologies have spawned a feverish excitement for what some see as a coming revolution in industrial production. This “Third Industrial Revolution” will provide many investment opportunities—such as green energy development and new kinds of direct investment in those nations most likely to benefit—as well as the potential for a steep rise in returns. These are life-changing developments, and the consensus among experts is that we will all witness their impact very soon. In the years ahead, technological improvements in robotics and automation will boost productivity and efficiency, which will translate into economic gains for manufacturers. Nouriel RoubiniIt will also benefit highly skilled workers—principally software developers, engineers, and those who work in material science and research. (If you’re a parent or a grandparent, you should encourage the younger generations to explore any talents they possess in these fields.) Consumers and individuals should also benefit from lower retail prices caused by lower production costs to manufacturers. In short, things will be cheaper. The quick growth of smart software over the past few decades has been perhaps the most important force shaping the coming manufacturing revolution. The extraordinary rise of the computer software industry has led many of the world’s best minds to focus on the challenges of developing better, smarter, more efficient computer code. As software development becomes more “glamorous,” the number of bright youngsters studying software engineering increases, creating a virtuous cycle for the software industry. In addition to software services, a number of new technologies driving the next manufacturing revolution are just now beginning to be felt. They’re like foreshocks, early tremors of the coming earthquake. On the vanguard of this revolution we find 3D printing. Sometimes 3D printing is called “additive manufacture,” because the process involves computer-controlled robots adding layers of materials to create new things. (Traditional manufacturing usually removes layers from raw material, for example the way a lathe cuts away metal.) 3D printing and related technologies will open the door to advances in manufacturing that have never before been possible: Nouriel RoubiniOn the plus side of the equation, these changes promise a great boom in productivity. Products will be created more cheaply than ever before. Early adopters of new technology will reap a windfall by perfecting the new techniques. Highly skilled jobs will be created for those educated enough to participate in the new tech-savvy manufacturing world. A few new high-tech manufacturing billionaires may be added to the ranks of the software barons of old. However, for those workers not fortunate enough to participate in the gains of the new economy, it may feel as though the whole revolution is happening somewhere else. Entire economies risk being destabilized in countries that rely on advanced manufacturing and on service sector jobs. (If you’re reading this, chances are you live in one.) But remember the dark shadows of those silver linings: with each new gain comes the potential loss of something else. We know what we have to gain from this automated future. But what, specifically, do we stand to lose? In my view, from the economic perspective, the technological forces driving this revolution tend to have the following three downside biases. That is, advances in technology tend to be: The risk is that workers in high-skilled, blue-collar manufacturing jobs will be displaced by machines before the dust settles at the end of the Third Industrial Revolution. We may be heading toward a future where factories consist of one highly skilled engineer running hundreds of machines—with one worker left sweeping the floor. In fact, the person who sweeps the floor may soon lose that job to a faster, better, cheaper, industrial strength Roomba Robot! For the last 30 years, emerging-market economies have increasingly displaced developed-market economies in the manufacturing sector as a base of production. This is a story we all know: the transition from the old industrial powers of Western Europe and North America to the new ones in Asia. But despite this shift, developed-market economies have somehow made up for those losses in their labor markets. Over the last 20 years, the overall unemployment rate in the United States has hovered around 5% on average—except during periods of economic recession, when it has spiked upward for short periods of time. In general, however, the loss of those manufacturing jobs has not caused catastrophic levels of unemployment. How? Well, the short answer is the service economy. Nouriel Roubini(Of course, this replacement of manufacturing jobs with service jobs has not been equally distributed. Some regions have suffered more than others. For example, the so-called Rust Belt in the upper Midwestern section of the United States has experienced more economic pain than most other regions. But while the local suffering has been great in those regions hardest hit, the overall trend throughout most developed-market economies is that lost manufacturing jobs have been absorbed largely by new jobs created in the service sector.) In my view, however, there’s no guarantee that this positive scenario—of service-sector jobs making up for lost manufacturing sector jobs—will continue. In fact, some of the trends mentioned earlier imply that the Third Industrial Revolution will unleash forces that threaten the relatively benign status quo. In addition to the job losses in the manufacturing sector, these trends also threaten the very service-sector jobs that have so far helped us avoid an employment crisis. To put the coming changes into context, think of what e-books have already done: with a click, you can now download almost any book for about $10 on your iPad or Amazon Kindle. Nouriel RoubiniThis is a great service and convenience for consumers. But most of the jobs in the printing and distribution of books—and soon in the newspaper and magazine industry—are already gone. (And so are tons of jobs in the pulp paper industry—though that may come as a relief to environmentalists). Yet this is all just the tip of the iceberg. The powerful forces unleashed by technology that will radically slash jobs in the future are already upon us. Industries affected will range from health care to retail, education, finance, transportation, real estate, and even government. One of the affected industries may even be your own. Think of the potential risks to service-sector jobs in the context of what I call the “Automated Checkout Economy.” Several decades ago, few people thought that low-paying jobs in the retail sector would be outsourced or eliminated. Technological progress may soon change their tune. While grocery and checkout jobs cannot be entirely eliminated, at least not quite, technology can assist in drastically reducing the number of human beings needed to fill the remaining positions. A trip into a drug store in New York City, my home for the last several years, will often reveal a single pharmacy clerk watching over four automated checkout terminals, where customers scan and pay for their own purchases. I imagine that you’ve probably seen something similar in your own town. Other low-wage and labor intensive jobs in retail, such as stocking the shelves of supermarkets with food, will soon be replaced by machines that can do those jobs better and faster than humans could. This has already begun to happen in traditional brick-and-mortar stores, while automation at online “e-tailers” has gone even further. Giants like Amazon have already built massive robot-staffed warehouses to distribute their orders. One day soon, your friendly neighborhood UPS or FedEx driver delivering those Amazon packages may even be replaced by a drone. And it may be sooner than you think. Nouriel RoubiniIn retail, the slashing of middle management jobs has already begun, as computers have become more efficient not just at crunching numbers but at providing managers with the right information at the right time. Another trend that may result in a decrease in service-sector jobs is something we might call “The Offshoring Pathway to Automation.” During the first phase of the transition to a truly globalized labor market, New York Timescolumnist Thomas Friedman and others popularized the narrative of high-skilled jobs being outsourced from developed markets to emerging markets. (Friedman’s book The World Is Flat is highly recommended reading on this topic.) While this trend continues, it supports potential for a still greater transition. Think, for example, about the process now in place for offshoring medical services. A patient in New York or London may have his MRI sent digitally to, say, Bangalore, where a highly skilled radiologist reads the scan. However, that highly skilled radiologist in Bangalore may only be paid a quarter of what a New York radiologist would earn for reading tests. It raises the question: how long before a computer can read those images faster, better, and cheaper than that Bangalore radiologist can? Such a transition is not far off. The offshoring process has already broken down reading an MRI into a series of simple steps resulting in digital output. That digital output can then easily be turned into an input in a fully automated process. This kind of transition, from offshoring to automation, may become a factor in reducing service-sector jobs in developed and emerging markets in the near future. The Third Industrial Revolution also coincides with other systemic changes taking place in the economy. Entire industries in the service sector will have to shrink massively for reasons initially unrelated to advances in technology. Let’s take two of the most obvious examples: the financial-services sector and real estate. In the years leading up to the economic collapse of 2008-‘09, market bubbles fueled huge run-ups in the prices of financial assets and real estate. With a bubble in asset prices came an explosion in compensation, causing new workers to flood into those sectors. As the last remnants of those bubbles deflate, job cuts in those industries may become inevitable. But over time, technology may allow even the jobs in real estate and finance to be first outsourced and then totally eliminated. Today, hundreds of thousands of back-office jobs in the financial sector are outsourced to India and other emerging markets. But tomorrow, a piece of computer code may be able to generate the same sophisticated analytics that some of Wall Street’s highly paid professionals now create. Real estate—which is now highly labor intensive, with a plethora of agents and brokers—is experiencing a revolution. 12 years ago, in 2002, I was able to buy my first apartment in New York without a real estate agent by using the online New York Times listings. Today, even more sophisticated online tools reduce the need even further for expensive middlemen. A revolution is also underway in education, which is also currently a very labor-intensive field. With the growth of ever-more sophisticated online courses, will we still need hundreds of thousands of teachers in the decades to come? And what will all those former teachers do to earn a living instead? It becomes possible to imagine a future where the top 100 economists in the world, for example, can provide high-quality and cheap online courses in their field. Those changes, however, would mean displacing the jobs of hundreds of thousands of other economics professors in the process. Nouriel RoubiniIndeed, in places like emerging-market Africa, where building brick-and-mortar schools is expensive and where training high-quality teachers is difficult, online courses and cheap tablet computers could gradually begin to replace traditional education, making it even more affordable. Ironically, this would lead to some unemployment, as the demand for highly educated people to fill teaching positions declines. Governments are shedding labor too, particularly governments burdened by high deficits and debts. The e-government trend can also lead to labor savings in the way in which government services are provided to the public. You can find tons of public services online and avoid spending hours standing in line in an overcrowded office just to request a few government forms. Even transportation is being revolutionized by technology. Today a friendly Uber driver or a car-sharing service like Zip Car can replace the need to buy your own car or even rent one. But in a matter of years, driverless cars—courtesy of Google and others—may render the job of a driver or chauffeur obsolete. So, whether it’s retail or finance, education, health care, transportation, or even government, a massive technological revolution will sharply reduce jobs over time. Low-skilled jobs and medium-skilled white collar jobs will be the first to go, as they have always been. In order to better understand the future, it’s helpful to take a look back at the past. During the First Industrial Revolution, which began around the same time as American independence from Great Britain, life began to shift away from agriculture toward increasing industrialization. Farmers moved to cities, and farms became industrialized. Factories became widespread. A factory owner could take a farmer, perhaps a farmer who could not read or write, and give him a job. New methods—like the division of labor—and new machines allowed that farmer to become more productive. In fact, farmers were able to generate more “output” in a factory than on a farm. But unlike modern automation, the machines needed to be run by a new generation of workers: Men and women needed to “man” those machines. Productivity increased—and so did wages. The Second Industrial Revolution, during the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th, was an extension of the first. During those years, there was an explosion in technology and methods of communication. Thanks to the telegraph, the world became “wired” for the first time. The new advances in technology, however, cut both ways. Take the case of Frederick Winslow Taylor, a major figure in the Second Industrial Revolution. Taylor, known as the father of scientific management, once wrote that the brawn required for handling pig iron was proof in itself of the intellectual unfitness of ironworkers to manage their own work. This is hardly a democratic sentiment, and it was more or less the common one. While new “scientific” methods of management increased the productivity of workers, improvements in working conditions lagged behind. (Taylor’s views didn't help matters.) Perhaps the takeaway lesson is that it’s easier to improve technical methods of production than workers’ opportunities. But despite these challenges, the Second Industrial Revolution created a higher demand for labor. As we sit on the cusp of a Third Industrial Revolution, a revolution that is both industrial and digital in nature, it’s not certain that the demand for labor will continue to grow as technology marches forward—unless the proper policies to nurture job growth are put in place. The world began to change during the first Digital Revolution—during the rise of the Internet in the late ‘90s. Then, the digital divide between those who knew how to use computers and those who didn’t led to an income gap between more-skilled workers and less-skilled workers. At the extreme, as I mentioned in my introduction, some serious thinkers are even worried about technology not only replacing humans in jobs—but actually replacing humans entirely. The implications of artificial intelligence, not just for jobs, but human life, are now being pondered by some of the best minds in technology. There used to be a science fiction term for a state where human beings were no longer able to control technology: It was called “the Singularity.” In the future, this Singularity may no longer be just science fiction. Of course, there are more optimistic sides of this story. Some of those perspectives show a much rosier picture. The green revolution in technology is a perfect example. (Jeremy Rifkin is a believer in this view. In his 2011 book The Third Industrial Revolution, he makes a case for his bullish outlook. Rifkin is optimistic about a great many things: green renewable energy, urbanization of structural power plants, hydrogen cells, and an Internet grid for power transmission and distribution.) These new technologies carry with them the promise of cleaner and more efficient energy. Nouriel RoubiniThis objective, of course, could not be more crucial. The search for green energy technology has become a global goal. The evidence of environmental damage, caused by pollution and the burning of fossil fuels, is now beyond question. To cite just one sobering example of the size of the challenge, a study by the World Health Organization (WHO) recently concluded that one in eight deaths were caused by air pollution. This is especially true in the developing world, where environmental hazards tend to be significant. As an example, air pollution in Beijing, where senior Chinese government officials live and work, has reached dangerous levels. The pollution in Beijing is now a practical threat to the Chinese economy and to China’s plans for future development. The Chinese government has begun to come down hard on its domestic polluters by enhancing the power of the state to regulate pollution. In light of the growing pressure to restrict environmental pollution, it seems reasonable to expect that there will be intensified research of green technologies. Hopefully, this research will address the environmental challenges at their root, rather than just fixing the damage of their effects. While the odds for a green technology breakthrough during the Third Industrial Revolution may be good, it seems very highly likely that serious challenges will follow in the wake of further developments in labor-reducing technologies. As more and more workers are displaced, governments will need to search urgently for new solutions to the problems of automation. During the First Industrial Revolution, some of the worst forms of winner-take-all capitalism festered in the newly industrialized cities of Europe and the United States. The rate of social and economic inequality increased rapidly. Despite the political opposition to change, a series of economic shocks ultimately convinced enlightened people in the US and Europe of the necessity of the social-welfare state. The benefits that workers take for granted in developed markets—restrictions on child labor, pensions, retirement benefits, unemployment benefits—were all created out of necessity. Enlightened social-welfare policies were ultimately vindicated, not just morally but practically. In places where social reform was not enacted, on the other hand, more destructive forms of change took place. (The most extreme case of this destruction was, obviously, the rise of Bolshevism in Russia.) Now the concern is that technology, together with other factors, is leading to a sharp rise in income and wealth inequality. There is a further risk that inequality will also lead to social and political instability. The redistribution of wealth—from labor to capital and from wages to profits—may even undermine growth. This makes perfect sense when we consider that the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few tends to reduce household consumption. In the United States, household consumption makes up more than two-thirds of our total GDP. The rise in inequality was initially the result of trade and globalization, such as jobs being offshored to emerging markets. However, the technological innovation we’re witnessing now has the potential to seriously worsen that inequality—especially when those innovations are, as we discussed earlier, capital intensive, skills biased, and labor saving. The view is even more pessimistic when you factor in the winner-take-all effects—also known as the so-called “superstar phenomenon.” Thanks to these winner-take-all effects, the top earners in any field now get the lion’s share of the compensation. After making a windfall profit, the “winners” are then able to use those riches to influence politicians and write their own legislation, which creates even more inequality. Nouriel RoubiniIn the 1930s, John Maynard Keynes had a more optimistic view of the impact of technology: he argued that eventually we could all work 15 hours a week and spend the rest of our time in leisure—like creating art and writing poetry. But in the Brave New World of labor-saving technology, it seems, 20% of the labor force will work 120 hours a week while the other 80% will have no jobs and no income. So the ideal world of Keynes may turn out to become a nightmare. Despite the rapid rate of change and the many uncertainties that lie ahead, the past can help to serve as a model for the future. Governments have a decided role to play in making that future livable—as they once understood. In that spirit, we must search for political and policy solutions to the coming challenges of the Third Industrial Revolution and promote them where we can. This is not, after all, the first time we’ve faced such problems. At the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th centuries, world leaders stepped up to the plate and came face to face with the horrors of industrialization. Child labor was abolished throughout the developed world, work hours were made humane, and a social safety net was put in place to protect both vulnerable workers and the larger (often fragile) economy.  Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers observed not long ago that we don’t yet have an Otto von Bismarck or a Teddy Roosevelt or a William Gladstone to mediate the current revolution now underway in the technology sector. The Canadian writer and politician Michael Ignatieff picked up on a similar theme in a Financial Times op-ed called “We need a new Bismarck to tame the machines.” The references to these political giants of the 19th and 20th centuries are revealing. Otto von Bismarck, the father of the unified German state, is usually credited with the creation of the modern social-welfare state in the 1880s. (He’s also credited with militarizing Germany as he unified it—but let’s stick with his good works for now.) At about the same time as Bismarck in Germany, British Prime Minister William Gladstone was reforming the most archaic aspects of the British electoral system. Ultimately, Gladstone’s work led to a great democratization and distribution of economic benefits in what was then the world’s leading industrial nation. Here in the United States, Theodore Roosevelt is perhaps best remembered for breaking up the large industrial monopolies then known as trusts. And we could also add Franklin Roosevelt to the list who, in the tradition of his older cousin, sought to reform the worst excesses of capitalism during the Great Depression. As we begin the search for enlightened solutions to the challenges that the Third Industrial Revolution presents, some of the overall themes begin to emerge. The first and most important characteristic is that the solution must channel the gains of technology to a broader base of the population than it has done so far. To make that happen, the solution must have a major educational component. In order to create broad-based prosperity, workers need the skills to participate in the wealth that capitalism generates. That is a major challenge in a world where technology is changing the labor markets at a dizzying and increasing pace. Workable solutions must address the world as it is, not as we wish it to be. The way ahead cannot be a naïve “Great Leap Forward”: it must embrace the dynamics and creativity of free markets. On the other hand, while the solutions we must pursue can leverage the ideas of enlightened capitalists, those solutions must not rely solely on the generosity of capitalists to succeed. That most fragile balance—between the freedom of markets and the prosperity of workers—must be sought and found. Make no mistake: The machines are coming. The question for us is what kind of welcome to prepare for them. This article originally appeared at Roubini's Edge.  Copyright 2014. Follow Roubini's Edge on Twitter. FREE AppDownload
Every holiday season in December, legendary economist Gary Shilling mails a bottle of fresh honey to a selected group of people who work in finance.  Shilling is a recreational beekeeper and has an apiary in the back yard of his New Jersey home. He has sent clients, colleagues, friends and experts in finance he likes a honey bottle for years. (Our deputy editor Sam Ro just got one in the mail.) We visited Shilling's home a couple of years ago and he told us all about the challenges and benefits of beekeeping. Produced by Kamelia Angelova &amp; Robert Libetti
Macroeconomics Finally Gets Interesting YouTube / John MauldinJohn Mauldin2015 may be the year that macroeconomics really becomes interesting again, if it hasn’t already. After a long period of relatively coordinated central bank policies and remarkably low volatility, the macro scene is becoming more dynamic. That’s great for those who live and die by dramatic long-term shifts in global markets, but it should be terrifying for emerging-market policymakers, currency carry traders, Texas oil men, and, frankly, the average investor. King Volatility is back on his throne. A LOT can go wrong in this kind of environment, and traditional portfolio design (sloppy combinations of active managers in a 60/40, 70/30, or 80/20 framework) will simply not let you weather a major economic storm. Think 2008. Think 1937. Think 1998 if LTCM hadn’t been dealt with and banks and nations around the world had been a lot more levered – as they are today. The potentials for disruption are enormous, and not just for markets. Let’s start with a general list of topics. But all of the above are negative tail risks. Where are the bright spots for the future? If the proper stance really is cautious optimism, how does one consciously allocate capital today? Those are nine bullet points off the top of my head, but I’m sure you could add a few. What questions are on your radar screen? I would love to hear what parts of the big picture may be missing, and please feel free to suggest reading and research. I actually do read all the replies in response to each week’s letter. Now, all of the above is going to be more than we can cover in this letter, but let’s get started. The US: A Bubble in Complacency While all the data shows that this is the weakest recovery in 75 years in terms of renewed GDP growth and employment, the fact is that the recovery keeps progressing. Yesterday’s unemployment report was relatively strong, even if a significant number of the jobs were seasonal and of the lower-paying variety. The good news for me is that the number of people classified as working part-time for economic reasons fell by 177,000. Part of the true weakness in this recovery has been the marked rise in part-time employees. Clearly, some of that is due to Obamacare. Right now, the way I see the odds, it is likely that this soft recovery will continue. For a recession to happen there would have to be some kind of shock. So what potential shocks are on the horizon? I can see several (and I’m sure if I go to Zero Hedge I will find a lot more). So where’s the downside? I have written in previous letters that much of the current recovery, as subdued as it is, is due to the remarkable energy renaissance that is being experienced in several states around the nation. At least a third of GDP growth now comes from the energy industry. An outsized proportion of job growth (and they’re good-paying jobs at that) is a direct or indirect result of increased energy production. Texas has been home to 40% of all new jobs created since June 2009. In 2013, the city of Houston had more housing starts than all of California. Much, though not all, of that growth is due directly to oil. Estimates are that 35–40% of total capital expenditure growth is related to energy. But it’s no secret that not only will energy-related capital expenditures not grow next year, they are likely to drop significantly. The news is full of stories about companies slashing their production budgets. This means lower employment, with all of the knock-on effects. Lacy Hunt and I were talking yesterday about Texas and the oil industry. We have both lived through five periods of boom and bust, although I can only really remember three. This is a movie we’ve seen before, and we know how it ends. Texas Gov. Rick Perry has remarkable timing, slipping out the door to let new governor Greg Abbott to take over just in time to oversee rising unemployment in Texas. The good news for the rest of the country is that in prior Texas recessions the rest of the country has not been dragged down. But energy is not just a Texas and Louisiana story anymore. I will be looking for research as to how much energy development has contributed to growth and employment in the US. At the very least, low energy prices are going to be a headwind for growth. Has the rest of the economy picked up enough to offset a struggling oil industry? Attention must be paid. The other thing we agreed on is that we are a little spooked by how fast the Japanese yen has fallen in the last few months. Both of us are serious Japanese bears and have been for years, but we would like to see a bit more control in the plunge of the yen, thank you very much. Or rather, <U+3042><U+308A><U+304C><U+3068><U+3046> – arigato. And it’s not like there aren’t warning signs. Doug Short over at Advisor Perspectives did a fabulous and very thorough report this week on valuations and Tobin’s Q ratio, looking into all aspects of it. Let’s just use one of his great charts, which demonstrates that the Q ratio is clearly in bubble territory, outpaced only by the tech market bubble of 2000. (And as Doug shows, further appropriate refinements in the Q ratio result in an even greater current overvaluation.)  We could also look at Shiller’s P/E ratio, which is clearly signaling overvaluation and (except during the tech bubble) has always seen significant corrections from its current valuation. Note that small-caps are already in a bear market; the somewhat (but not always) useful leading indicator of high-yield bonds is clearly falling; and the commodity sector is taking a beating. Quantitative easing has ended. If QE3 was indeed the driver of the bull market, we should find out soon. With that noted, we have a very supportive monetary backdrop, with the Fed unlikely to ease significantly for quite some time. Turmoil outside of the United States will only increase a flight to safety, which is generally supportive of a rising equity market for the currency of choice. Further, the following chart of global valuations (hat tip to my friend Barry Ritholtz over at The Big Picture) shows that they are generally well within reasonable historical levels, except in Japan and the odd country here and there. As we will discuss below, Japan has a macroeconomic environment that is extremely supportive of equities (as in the massive amounts of equities that are being bought by their central bank and by large pension funds that are selling bonds to buy Japanese equities).  The Land of the Falling Yen I got an email from Hideyuki Sano with Reuters News in Tokyo, asking me to respond to the following query: Despite its snowballing public debts, Japan has so far managed to muddle through, avoiding a major punishment by “the bond vigilantes.” Shorting JGBs has rarely been profitable, and no one seems willing to do so now with the BOJ soaking up a huge amount of them. Yet, many people think this is a disaster waiting to happen. I would like to know [your] thoughts on how the whole thing could unravel and how one should trade on this. That’s a very reasonable question. I’ve maintained for several years that I don’t think it’s practical to try to short Japanese bonds, but there are some very smart people who disagree with me. Let me see if I can lay it out for you. Japan’s opportunity to make a good decision was lost many years ago. Your debt-to-GDP is now in the 250% range, although more and more of that is being soaked up by the Bank of Japan. However, if interest rates were allowed to rise, it would not be too long until interest-rate expenses consumed an unmanageable portion of your tax revenues. Therefore, it is clear to me, at least, that the Bank of Japan and the Ministry of Finance will not allow interest rates to rise. The Bank of Japan will not only continue to monetize Japanese government current debt but at today’s rate is monetizing in the range of 7 to 8% of GDP in addition. For all intents and purposes, the Bank of Japan is the bond market. Your pension funds (and I assume banks and other institutions) are slowly divesting themselves of Japanese debt. A basic rule of markets is that you can control price or quantity but not both. Since the Bank of Japan is releasing massive quantities of yen into the market, the price of the yen is falling. It will continue to fall as long as the Bank of Japan is monetizing debt at such prodigious rates. I believe there is real potential for the yen to fall back to the rate of 200 to the dollar, which is only a retracement of about 50% from its all-time high (or at least its high in my lifetime). I have structured a 10-year options trade that would pay for half my mortgage if the yen does indeed get to 200. Arigato. By the way, since Japan is exploring brand-new territory (monetary policy-wise), it is not altogether clear how controlled the fall of the yen will be. There was a reason I bought 10-year options, as I think the odds are that this move will play out over a protracted period. But it is altogether possible that the currency market will simply throw up its hands at some point and yell “Enough!” And then the yen will fall too far too fast, and the Bank of Japan will feel it necessary to reduce its monetary easing. The question then becomes, what will happen to interest rates as a result? A drop of 10-20% from current accommodation? Probably not too much, and perhaps that would slow the fall of the yen. A 50% drop in accommodation? Shiruka (<U+77E5><U+308B><U+304B> – who knows?). One of the characteristics of unexplored territories is that there are always surprises as you come to the top of the next hill. Although I do not believe it is their intention, the Bank of Japan has effectively launched what other countries will see as a currency war. Korea? China? The rest of Asia? Germany?! They will not easily give up their rights to be competitive. You must understand this: currency wars are not logical. No one wins. The fact that the Japanese currency has strengthened against the dollar by something like 400% over the past 40+ years does not figure into the economic calculus of those countries whose businesses compete with Japan’s. That was so yesterday. I expect the situation will have a rather messy ending, Sano-san. My advice to anyone living in Japan? As much as possible, reduce your holdings of yen and move into gold or other hard assets if you want to keep your assets in Japan. Holding bonds and currency accounts will erode your buying power over time. I think the “trade of the rest of decade” will be to short the yen and to be long Japanese “intellectual property” stocks. By that I mean companies that sell technological products as opposed to products whose main costs are for materials and commodities (including energy) that must be imported into Japan. There is a reason your pension companies are rotating out of bonds and into stocks. Most individuals and businesses have much smaller accounts and can move so much more rapidly. Take advantage of the time you have. The Dollar Rises Again For the rest of the world, let me provide a few charts. As I write this letter, the yen is 121.5 to the dollar. Interestingly enough, the euro is at $1.23. Those numbers will cross in the not-too-distant future as the euro drops and the yen continues to rise. The chart below from Bloomberg shows the rise of the trade-weighted US dollar as measured by the US Dollar (DXY) Index.  With such divergence comes the major macro risk that the US Dollar Index is breaking out in a big way. To anyone who believes in technical analysis (and skeptics should keep in mind that a lot of macro and currency traders DO), it looks as though the USD is ready to break out of a 29-year downtrend that began with the Plaza Accord way back September 1985. (“To keep that in perspective, it was less than two weeks after I was born,” says Worth Wray). Raoul Pal notes that this is the biggest downward-sloping wedge in the history of fiat money, and we may be very close to a BIG dislocation if it continues.  I wrote about this in a recent letter, “A Scary Story for Emerging Markets” (which Business Insider renamed “The Dollar Plays the Villain in the Emerging Markets Horror Story”), but this drastic strengthening of the dollar could not come at a worse time for our highly levered, highly interconnected global financial system. But this letter is already long enough, so we will start there next week. Cincinnati, the Cayman Islands, and Florida I am home for the rest of the month (with perhaps a quick trip to DC being the one outing), but the calendar for next year is beginning to fill up. I see Cincinnati, Grand Cayman, and Florida on my schedule. It has been a while since I’ve been in the Cayman Islands, and this time I will take a short hop over to Little Cayman to visit my friend Raoul Pal for a few days. A brilliant macroeconomist and trader, Raoul has now based himself in Little Cayman, although he frequently flies to visit clients. He is also a partner with Grant Williams in Real Vision Television, a fascinating new take on internet investment TV. I’ll be writing more about it in the future. As I noted above, Jack Rivkin (CIO of Altregris) and I are going to be interviewing Ian Bremmer next Tuesday. We’ll be talking about the geopolitical situation all over the world and how it will affect our investments. I hope to steer the conversation to what is happening in Russia and the Middle East, with of course a nod to China; but we’ll see what Jack and Ian want to talk about. My goal is for listeners to walk away with greater clarity about the changing geopolitical landscape and an actionable perspective on global markets and the potential for diversifying investment alternatives in 2015.

Today is my granddaughter Lively’s fifth birthday, so after brunch with some of the kids we will go to her party. Her mother, Tiffani, tells me it’s a “jump party.” I’m not sure what that means, but it sounds like fun. They grow up so fast. Daughter Melissa (with a little help from her brother Chad) put up the Christmas tree and decorations today, so the house is just about ready for the holidays. Since we don’t have a fireplace in the high-rise, we’ve had to get a little creative in hanging the stockings, and every kid’s spouse and grandkid has their own stocking. I’m not quite sure how they remember whose is whose, but they do. This Christmas, it looks like all the kids will be here along with the grandkids (and maybe even a brand-new one, due right around that time). As the kids spread out and get married, it seems their inlaws want to snag them for some of the holidays, too. So my kids seem to have worked out that on either Thanksgiving or Christmas they will all be here. My writing schedule has gotten quite crowded. In addition to Thoughts from the Frontline and Outside the Box, Tiffani and I are more than halfway through a book on millionaires; Worth and I are in the home stretch of a book on China; and Worth and I are continuing to forge our way through a book on the implications of a major dollar rally in the midst of sovereign debt corrections. I am seriously considering only publishing the book on China in electronic form and for a much lower price than normal, mostly as an experiment. I literally have no idea what will happen if we do. I know that the explosive growth of e-books is beginning to look more normal, but they have already taken significant market share. I would like to know what you think. And if you have any experience publishing e-books on investing, I would like to talk to you. Have a great week. My calendar seems to have filled up, just when I am trying to spend more time reading, thinking, and writing – and in the gym, of course. And we wonder where the time goes.

Columbia Pictures/"The Social Network""The Underwriting" is being billed as a cross between "The Social Network" and "The Wolf of Wall Street." Michelle Miller, a former banker at JPMorgan, just landed a six-figure book deal based on her self-published online series "The Underwriting," a 12-part weekly serial found on theunderwriting.com.  The corporate thriller is being billed as "The Social Network"-meets-"The Wolf of Wall Street" and takes place at an online dating startup, according to the AP. Facebook.com/MichelleMiller"The Underwriting" author Michelle Miller. The story, scheduled for a May 26 release, will take on both Silicon Valley and Wall Street and explore office politics, sex, and murder at a San Francisco startup preparing for an IPO. Miller, who received an MBA from Stanford University, plans to write five books for the series; the Penguin Random House imprint has only acquired the first two books.  Lauren Weisberger, author of the "The Devil Wears Prada," says of Miller's series: Michelle Miller's debut novel reads like a salacious, ripped-from-the headlines tell-all of Manhattan's young, wealthy, and uber-successful. From the very first page, I felt like I'd met these characters in real life: Todd, the hot, rich, d-bag banker; Tara, the striver perfectionist who can't quite please everyone; Kelly, the good girl with a secret, and Josh, the creepy savant genius who just might change the world.  What do they all have in common? A certain location-based hookup app that alters each of their lives in shocking ways. Get ready to settle in-you won't be able to put down this book. Here's more from 'The Underwriting''s website:  The Underwriting initially aired on this website as a 12-part weekly serial in the spring of 2014. Episodes, which took about 30 minutes to read, were released each Wednesday, free to read for 24 hours, or available for purchase as text or audio files. The series was accompanied by DJ playlists, photography, finance tutorials and brand sponsorships, and found a global audience whose loyalty to the story and its delivery was, for its author, the stuff of much skin-tingling. "I really wanted to create a new type of publishing model," Miller told Elle magazine in March. "I wanted to create a project that mimicked the world that I was talking about, and to do that, I felt it needed to function like a start-up. So I set up an LLC, raised money from venture capitalist investors for equity, and basically, they get a piece of whatever I would’ve gotten if I had just done it as an individual writer. To me, you can invest in content the same way you can invest in an app, and maybe it works, and maybe it doesn’t." Miller told the magazine that there a few misconceptions about Silicon Valley and Wall Street: I worked at JPMorgan’s private bank in the Palo Alto office, so we were managing assets for the new wealth at Facebook and Instagram and Pinterest and other Silicon Valley tech companies. Wall Street is not as conniving and sexy as people think it is. And Silicon Valley is not as heroic and well-intentioned as it’s often written out to be. I find Silicon Valley to be a much more difficult place to work than Wall Street, especially as a woman. In Silicon Valley, there’s this general “I think I’m better than you” attitude. I also think that Silicon Valley gets let off the hook, because there’s almost this high school mentality of it’s mean to pick on the nerd, but at the end of the day, there are some really difficult personalities that don’t necessarily make for good companies or good working environments. It’s not all just broomball tournaments and free food and hoodies. There’s some real undiscussed tension that’s honestly like Wall Street 20 years ago. I mean you can look at company websites and you see the white dudes running the business, the immigrants doing the engineering, and cute girls doing HR and ad sales. That’s as much as you’re ever going to get as a girl there. Watch the trailer for Miller's "The Underwriting" series below:  FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Nacho DoceFA Insights is a daily newsletter from Business Insider that delivers the top news and commentary for financial advisors.  The BRICs Are Fizzling Out (Financial Planning) Ever since Goldman Sachs's Jim O'Neill came up with the acronym about 10 years ago to represent Brazil, Russia, India and China, the MSCI BRIC index has gained 11% annually. But that growth has been mostly front-loaded. This year, it saw an annualized return of just 1.4%. By contrast, the US broad market index when up at an annualized return of 8.5%, but saw a one-year gain of 15.6%. And since the BRIC nations have problems, investors are hesitant to really jump in. Brazil and Russia are suffering from oil problems, while China is slowing. India recently saw a surge stocks following the new government, but that leaves the shares 50% more expensive than the others. The ECB May Provide A Degree Of Stability In A Volatile World (PIMCO)  The European Central Bank is expanding its balance sheet to mitigate low growth and lower inflation, which should keep European assets supported. Additionally, as volatility and geopolitical uncertainty continues to increase, the ECB will provide a degree of stability. "In a world of relatively low government yield, European (and global) credit markets offer some attractive opportunities for higher returns. Investors may favor flexible, diversified credit strategies, which can take advantage of market opportunities and deliver return potential in the range of 4%-6%, with similar levels of volatility," writes Eve Tournier of Pimco. Goldman Sachs Has To Pay 2 Brokers $7.6 Million (Reuters)  Goldman Sachs has to pay two brokers $7.6 million after they were "wrongfully terminated" back in 2007. The brokers alleged that Goldman forced them to forfeit deferred commissions after they were fired, reports Suzanne Barlyn. "We do not believe that the law or the record remotely supports the finding on liability or the amount of damages awarded and we are considering our options, including an appeal," a Goldman Sachs spokesperson said. 3 UBS Advisers Just Left For Wells Fargo (The Wall Street Journal)  Three UBS advisers just left UBS Wealth Management for Wells Fargo. The team focused primarily on corporate retirement plans and high-net-worth families, reports Michael Wursthorn.  The team oversaw $463 million in assets, and generated $3.5 million in fees and commissions for UBS. They will be moving those assets to Wells Fargo in two offices, one in Chicago and the other in Chesterton, Indiana. Married Couples Can Employ A Combo Strategy For Social Security (Investment News)  Couples always want to beat the system, so to speak, when it comes to filing benefits. But it's important to know that both cannot file restricted claims in an attempt to collect spousal benefits while their own retirement benefits grow until they turn 70. Unfortunately, Social Security doesn't work that way. Fortunately, there is a way for couples to collect benefits together. "Depending on their age differences and benefit amounts, a married couple could employ a combo strategy where one spouse files and suspends at 66 and the other spouse, who is also at least 66, files a restricted claim for spousal benefits only," writes Mary Beth Franklin. And then, "at 70, each spouse could switch to their own retirement benefit." FREE AppDownload

Back in November, we highlighted this chart of US oil production. We called it the chart of the year.  And now, the chart of the year is even more impressive.  Mark Perry at AEI tweeted out an updated version of the chart on Wednesday after the EIA's latest status report showed that US crude output surged again during the first week in December. Crude production rose to 9.12 million barrels per day in the first week of December, the highest since 1986.  Back in November, we highlighted comments from Deutsche Bank economist Torsten Slok, who said, "The most important reason why oil prices are falling is because of the dramatic increase in recent years in US crude oil production." And this story hasn't changed. On Thanksgiving, OPEC — the 12-member oil cartel that includes oil exporters like Saudi Arabia and Kuwait — declined to curb production in an effort to combat the decline in prices.  On Wednesday, Saudi oil minister Ali Al-Naimi told reporters that market pressures push commodities up and down, up and down. "Why should I cut production?" Al-Naimi asked reporters.  Three weeks ago when we first highlighted this chart, WTI crude oil was trading at around $75; on Wednesday, WTI was near $61.  And US production, at least for now, is showing no signs of slowing down.  @Mark_J_Perry FREE AppDownload
Researchers have solved the longstanding mystery of why you always think your company's CEO is super hot and your friends just do. not. understand.* Familiarity plays a role. A team of researchers led by Kevin Kniffin at Cornell have a new paper out in Leadership Quarterly that finds that within groups, followers (or employees) find their leaders more physically attractive than the average person does. There's something of a debate in the science of attractiveness about whether familiarity with someone makes them more or less attractive to you. The authors think the two opposite conclusions might have something to do with how familiar you are with the person and how much you identify with them and perceive them as being like you (in your in-group, in sociology speak). The researchers "found that people with strong ties to a group or organization (say, a political party or a business) rate their own leaders much higher on a scale of physical attractiveness than do outsiders," according to Kniffin, who wrote up his research in the Harvard Business Review Wednesday. They tested this by asking whether leaders of a group are perceived as more physically attractive to their followers using legislative aides and political leaders in Wisconsin. Kniffin writes, "we chose legislative aides because they interact closely with legislators and they have a clear stake in the success of their leaders since the number of aide positions fluctuates as a function of which party has more power." Here's a chart of the results: The Leadership Quarterly Democrats rated Democratic leaders they were familiar with as most attractive (and Democrats they were less familiar with less attractive than even Republicans they were familiar with). The results for Republicans paralleled that of the Democrats. The caveat here is that the research was conducted "within the month following hotly contested local elections," which may have skewed the results. The authors note this is important because it can sometimes be unclear why people choose leadership roles, from an academic perspective. Responsibility is a lot of work, and depending on the group we're talking about, the monetary rewards might not be that high. From the implications section of the paper: Our article also contributes to research concerning the "ultimate" question ... of why people endure the costs of leadership since our studies suggest a non-obvious, nonmonetary benefit of being a leader (i.e., people tend to view leaders of their organizations as relatively more physically attractive). They also conclude that this might have something to do with why people develop inter-office romances. * I just made that up.

Screenshot/Bloomberg NewsBen EdelmanHarvard Business School associate professor Ben Edelman has apologized to Sichuan Garden Chinese restaurant and Ran Duan following a tense series of emails between the two parties that went viral this week. HBS associate professor Ben Edelman criticized the restaurant and Duan, who manages the connecting Baldwin Bar, for supposedly overcharging him $4 on a recent takeout dinner order. Edelman said he had alerted local Boston authorities about Sichuan Garden's out-of-date website and Duan's initial offer to only refund him $3. Here is Edelman's newest statement, via his personal website: Many people have seen my emails with Ran Duan of Sichuan Garden restaurant in Brookline. Having reflected on my interaction with Ran, including what I said and how I said it, it's clear that I was very much out of line. I aspire to act with great respect and humility in dealing with others, no matter what the situation. Clearly I failed to do so. I am sorry, and I intend to do better in the future. I have reached out to Ran and will apologize to him personally as well. Edelman had previously defended his email exchange with Duan in a statement to Business Insider:  I think the Boston.com piece totally misses the benefit that all diligent consumers provide in looking for overcharges and other errors. We all rely on trust in our daily lives — that when sales tax is added, it actually applies and equals the specified amount; that the meter in a taxi shows the correct amount provided by law and correctly measures the actual distance; that when you order takeout, the price you see online matches the amount you pay in the restaurant. We all take most of this for granted. It would be a lot of trouble to all have to check these things day in and day out. That's exactly why we should be concerned when folks fall short — because hardly anyone ever checks, so these problems can go unnoticed and can affect, in aggregate, large amounts.If you look at my other work, e.g. http://www.benedelman.org/airfare-advertising/, you'll see I've been pretty diligent in holding large companies accountable for their false statements of price and other attempts to overcharge passengers. Should all small businesses get a free pass? Some people seem to think so, I wonder if that really makes sense.Notably, though not emphasized in the Boston.com piece, the restaurant at issue knew the website prices had been "out of date for quite some time." At what point should they do something about it? I'm pleased to have at least gotten the problem fixed for the benefit of others. Sichuan Garden also released a statement on Wednesday afternoon, which you can read in full on Boston.com. In the statement, Duan writes that Sichuan Garden appreciates the support it has received from the local community and people who have reached out from all over the world: We have been overwhelmed with the response and support that has flooded our way. It means the world to know that there are still good people in this world. We have been contacted by people from California all the way to Australia offering kind words and support. I have been attempting to keep up with writing back personally and thanking each and every one of you. We have been offered donations, free services, including website services and legal advice, which I kindly denied. I just want to make clear that we are not a business in financial distress. We have been blessed with the support of our amazing community and hospitality family that has understood the value of a hard working family. Your support and kind words are more then enough.

Via Google MapsSichuan Garden's Woburn, Massachusetts location. HBS associate professor Ben Edelman criticized Sichuan Garden and restauranteur Ran Duan, who manages the connecting Baldwin Bar, for supposedly overcharging him $4 on a recent takeout dinner order. Edelman said he had alerted local Boston authorities about Sichuan Garden's out-of-date website, and Duan's initial offer to only refund him $3. In a statement to Boston.com, Duan writes that Sichuan Garden appreciates the support it has received from the local community and people who have reached out from all over the world: We have been overwhelmed with the response and support that has flooded our way. It means the world to know that there are still good people in this world. We have been contacted by people from California all the way to Australia offering kind words and support.

We have been blessed with the support of our amazing community and hospitality family that has understood the value of a hard working family. Your support and kind words are more then enough. Duan's statement also takes a dig at Edelman's public perception as a bit of a pompous academic, saying, "I just want to apologize to Harvard for all the negative association they have been linked with this ordeal." Edelman released his own statement to Business Insider yesterday, defending his actions: I think the Boston.com piece totally misses the benefit that all diligent consumers provide in looking for overcharges and other errors.

In the battle between Elizabeth Warren and the Obama administration over whether or not Wall Street vet Antonio Weiss should head to the Treasury, Warren insists that one question remains: "His supporters say, 'Come on – he's a smart investment banker, so of course he is qualified to oversee all the complicated financial work done day in and day out at the Treasury.' But his defenders haven't shown that his actual experience prepares him for this job," said Warren in a speech at the Economic Policy Institute Tuesday. Ever since Elizabeth Warren began speaking out against President Obama’s nomination of investment banker Antonio Weiss for a senior Treasury position, Weiss supporters have pointed to his 20 years of experience in finance and his leadership position at Lazard as evidence of his eligibility. Warren insists, though, that Weiss's Wall Street background isn't the real reason she is opposing him; rather, it's the kind of financial experience that he has. She wants to know how Weiss' work in international mergers and acquisitions – much of which was conducted from outside the United States – has prepared him for a domestic finance role responsible for overseeing consumer policy, government debt, fiscal reserves, and the Treasury's stability. The White House on Tuesday provided this defense of Weiss, according to POLITICO's Ben White: "He's got deep expertise in the financial markets and economic issues that are appropriate for somebody to take on the responsibility ... He's been in the field of finance for 20 years, and in that time he's overseen numerous major financial transactions across a variety of industries that have driven significant investment inside the United States. This is somebody who has very good knowledge of the way that the financial markets work, and that is critically important when you're asking somebody to take on a position in the federal government that has such a significant bearing on those markets." But Warren's not satisfied with that kind of response. "We'd all scratch our heads if the President nominated a theoretical physicist to be the Surgeon General just because she had a background in 'science,'" she said in her speech. Warren's stance is nicely summed up in this post by Georgetown professor Adam Levitin, which she quoted in her speech. He says there's an unspoken assumption that anyone from Wall Street is automatically an expert in all things financial and, he says, "that's hooey." But, while Levitin gets right to the heart of the problem that he sees with Weiss's qualifications, Warren continues to weave that concern in with other arguments about revolving doors and Wall Street boys clubs. As long as she keeps that up, it will continue to look like she's making Weiss a symbol — the embodiment of her dislike for Wall Street — and not treating him as an individual nominee.

REUTERS/ Rebecca CookThe Dow fell 268 points on Wednesday. First, the scoreboard: And now, the top stories on Wednesday: 1. Stocks took a beating. After falling early in the day on Tuesday and then turning around, stocks started Wednesday lower and took a turn for the worse in the afternoon, with the Dow losing as many as 285 points at one point. Stocks attempted to stage a rally in the last hour of trade, before falling back to session lows into the close. 2. Oil was again the lead story in the markets, as WTI and Brent crude both made fresh lows, with WTI breaking below $61 a barrel and Brent falling below $65 a barrel for the first time since 2009. At one point on Wednesday, WTI was down more than 5%. There were a number of bad headlines for oil on Wednesday, with OPEC's latest report showing a reduction in demand expectations for 2015, the US EIA's latest status report showing an unexpected increase in inventories last week, and comments from Saudi Arabian Minister of Petroleum Ali Al-Naimi that suggested a change in tone out of OPEC.  3. In an afternoon email, NYSE Floor Governor Rich Barry noted that on the floor of the NYSE, all traders can talk about is oil. "While the sell-off in crude has been a drubbing of historic proportions, we do not think it is over yet.," Barry wrote. "Look for more pain and a little more bloodletting before we see a real bottom in place. Or, to quote one esteemed market-player in expressing his views on commodity prices, 'The number of human beings in the history of mankind who could consistently and accurately predict future commodity prices is Zero.'"  4. And while the oil and equity markets were falling sharply on Wednesday, the VIX, or volatility index, spiked. The VIX climbed to nearly 20 on Wednesday, a rise of more than 20%, bringing the measure's gains to almost 50% since Friday, when it was trading closer to 11. Long-dated US treasury bonds also rallied on Wednesday, with the 10-year falling back below 2.2% to as low as 2.16%, and the 30-year extending its gains to as low as 2.82%.  5. On Tuesday, BlackRock released its 2015 investment outlook, and the firm is looking for a few main themes next year: volatility and standout US growth.  6. It was an ugly day overall for oil and gas stocks, with the some of big losers including Hess, Marathon Oil, Williams, Devon Energy, and Noble Energy, which all fell more than 4%. Some of the other notable S&amp;P 500 losers were Yum! Brands, which last night said its sales in China still continue to recover at a slower pace than expected.  Don't Miss: Jeff Gundlach's Presentation On The Changing World Of Investing »       FREE AppDownload
Since Tuesday the Argentine stock market, the Merval, has been sinking. On Wednesday it fell 7%. In the last five trading days the index is down around 13%.Google Finance Investors are losing faith that the current administration will settle with holdout bondholders — "vultures" as President Fernandez calls them — in 2015. That's when a clause in their bond contract that the Argentine government says prohibits them from negotiating with the holdouts, the RUFO (Rights Upon Future Offers) clause, expires. A lot of investors were betting that 2015 would come around, and Argentina and the holdouts — led by Elliott Management founder Paul Singer — would sit down and sing Kumbaya. Instead Argentina is coming up with more creative ways to raise cash, like a recent debt swap plan the government has announced to raise $3 billion locally. The country owes about $12 billion in cash next year, according to Bloomberg. "...a successful debt swap also aims to strengthen the government’s bargaining position with the holdout creditors as a stronger domestic liquidity position would enable the CFK administration to continue to play a hard hand and renege on the holdouts proposed claims," says Oxford Economics Senior Economist Aryam Vasquez. "In addition, if successful, the swap would provide the administration with much political capital as the CFK government has been advocating the use of local law bonds in view of resolving the debt holdout issue." The debt swap could be subtle way of letting the holdouts know that RUFO was a way for Argentina to buy time to figure out a way to raise money without going to the international market. This is less subtle: "Argentina does not need to settle with the holdouts because it already won," said Federico Tomasevich, the President of Argentine investment bank Puente. "The international community is siding with Argentina on the issue of the vulture funds. The case is closed. That isn't say we can't calmly find a give the issue a proper resolution, but that will be for the next government." That next government won't be elected until the end of 2015. Now — some investors did see this coming. Hedge fund Fir Tree Partners shut down their Argentina fund earlier this month after gains of 20%. It's a signal that they believe things are only going downhill from here. And despite what seems like signs of Argentine optimism — and cash the country borrowed from the Chinese — Fir Tree may very well have a point. Argentina's relies heavily on commodity exports like soybeans for revenue, and commodities are getting crushed. It's clear that the country's 40% inflation rate is putting Argentines on guard. They're carrying lots of cash around, afraid that a crash could come and make any pesos they have stored in the bank basically worthless (or government property).  And because they carry around all that cash, Argentina has become the robbery capital of Latin America, according to a United Nations report. Mexico comes in a distant second. So no matter what happens, 2015 won't be a cakewalk for the current regime. The economic situation is bad, and to make matters worse, an Argentine Judge is investigating President's personal business for corruption. Agents even raided the Kirchner family hotel, Hotesur. When they got to Hotesur headquarters, it was empty. Go figure. FREE AppDownload
Some blocks and neighborhoods in New York City are so full of rich people that the Census Bureau can't reveal exactly how rich they are. The US Census Bureau recently released data from the 2009-2013 American Community Survey. The survey provides an amazingly comprehensive look at the demographic, social, and economic makeup of the country. In this data set, the Census Bureau has released ACS estimates at the block-group level, which for an urban area is essentially a block, small group of blocks, or a small neighborhood.  One of the many variables the ACS investigates is household income. In New York City, there were a handful of block groups with populations of at least 500 where the median household income is higher than $250,000 per year. One was in Brooklyn, and the rest were in Manhattan.

Stocks are tumbling and oil is getting crushed on Wednesday.  So you know what that means: the VIX is soaring! The VIX, or volatility index, is up almost 50% since last Friday, rising from around 11 to almost 19 in less than four trading days.  Headlines crossing Reuters on Wednesday said the VIX, which is up more than 21% just today, is on track for its biggest percentage gain since October 9. The VIX measures expected volatility in upcoming trading sessions. Back in the summer, a big story was how low the VIX was and how volatility had completely disappeared. And while markets were shook up in the fall, the VIX has still remained historically low. But in the last few days, the VIX has come alive.  In a big way. freestockcharts.com FREE AppDownload

Congress has agreed to use federal deposit insurance, which was designed to protect the savings accounts of consumers, to cover risky trading by the nation’s biggest banks. In a small provision in the budget bill, Congress agreed to allow banks to house their trading of swaps and derivatives alongside customer deposits, which are insured by the federal government against losses. The budget move repeals a portion of the Dodd-Frank financial reform act and, some say, lays the groundwork for future bailouts of banks who make irresponsibly risky trades. “It’s both a stealth move and indefensible,” said Dennis Kelleher, the head of Better Markets, a group that argues for great oversight of banks. In a note to clients, he later called it “a sneaky, midnight repeal.” “If Wall Street gets the upside in big bonuses from its high-risk derivatives deals, then it should also have to pay the downside for any losses,” Kelleher wrote. Richard Trumka, the head of labor union AFL-CIO, said his organizations also objected to the budget provision. “Dodd-Frank forced too-big-to-fail banks to move potentially toxic speculation in derivatives out of their government-insured banks,” Trumka said in a statement. “Wall Street’s friends in Congress are trying to once again put the public on the hook for the most dangerous aspects of the financial system.” Banks make their money primarily through two activities: lending out deposits to people or companies, and speculating on the markets. Laws like the defunct Glass-Steagall act were designed to separate the two activities. The Dodd-Frank rule recaptured a small part of that separation. The budget provision, however, retracts the rule, which has been a thorn in the paw of giant banks like JP Morgan and Citigroup. That rule, passed in 2010 and called the “swaps pushout rule”, dictated that banks had to keep certain arcane, risk-taking businesses away from customer deposits: swaps in stocks, commodities, and similar businesses. Other derivatives, however, could still sit in the section of the banks protected by government backing. The derivatives business is a lucrative and concentrated one: 95% of the trading in derivatives in the US are done by the five biggest banks, Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan. The banks have made more money in derivatives because they have government backing for deposits, Kelleher said. That’s no longer in place. “The swaps pushout provision was saying US taxpayers should not be paying for risky trading activities,” said Kelleher. Customer deposits – including the savings accounts of most Americans – are heavily regulated in size and scope by the federal government. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation provides a guarantee that, even if a bank goes under, customers can’t lose all of their money. The FDIC was created in response to worries about “runs on the bank” in the 1920s and 1930s as stock-market speculation, then the Great Depression, caused financial panic and destabilized the financial system. Lobbyists for banks including Citigroup had previously tried to rewrite the provision, drafting as many as 70 of the 85 lines in one 2012 update. The budget provision is a success for lobbyists and the banks they work for, but a loss to Americans who will have to foot the bill again if banks take too much risk, said Kelleher. Derivatives, particularly in mortgages, were at the center of the 2008 financial crisis as insurers like AIG nearly collapsed under the weight of their risk. Excess exposure to derivatives created a restructuring of the financial system as investment banks like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers went out of business due to fear over their financial exposure. Others fared better, but went through intense fear in the fall of 2008: Merrill Lynch had to be sold to Bank of America to survive, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley had to forge new identities as commercial banks, which allowed the Fed to protect them. The new budget provision once again acts as a promise that taxpayers will foot the bill for risky trading and speculation, Kelleher said. “If things go wrong, [the banks] get to run to the Fed for bailouts. That’s incredibly valuable to them,” he said. The surprise in the budget move is that everyone but banks considered the matter already settled. The Dodd-Frank rule dictated that banks would have to find new homes for their risk-taking unit to prevent them from taking risks with customer deposits. Even so, mistakes occurred. A notable example of a bank making a spectacular failing bet with customer money came in 2012, when JP Morgan used its $350bn chief investment office to make the infamous ‘London Whale’ trade, which led the bank to lose at least $6bn and led to a round of congressional hearings. JP Morgan increased its risk so much on the initial trade that the trader who initiated the bet called it “idiotic”. Swaps and derivatives are financial instruments that allow speculators to make bets on the future prices of stocks, bonds and commodities. Banks and companies also use these swaps and derivatives to hedge against price rises in corn, oil, and other commodities they use regularly; airlines, for instance, regularly use derivatives to hedge the price of fuel, and McDonald’s, among others, has hedges on the price of corn.   Since the passage of the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill in 2009, banks and their lobbyists have not given up hope in pushing back regulation. “Since the beginning of the financial crisis, the political world has buffeted the financial services sector with waves of new regulation in an attempt to punish the wicked and to make sure a similar crisis ‘never happens again’,” wrote Brian Gardner, Washington analyst for Keefe Bruyette &amp; Woods. Gardner said such efforts have been met with resistance from the financial services industry: “Ever since the law was passed in 2010, industry and observers (us included) have been waiting for a ‘technical corrections’ bill to fix mistakes in the law,” Gardner, however, estimated the chances of that happening at under 60% due to “populism” that still exists in Congress, putting the largest banks “in the political doghouse”, he wrote. “We think Senate Republicans will be wary about being seen as too close to Wall Street, and will avoid making changes to Dodd-Frank that may expose them to attacks.” But Gardner echoed the hopes of many in the financial industry that yet more of Dodd-Frank’s reforms could be pulled back: “With the major pieces of the Dodd-Frank Act mostly in place and with a change in control of the Senate, we think 2015 offers the sector the first legitimate prospect for policymakers to review some of the new regulatory landscape and see what works and what they got wrong.” This article originally appeared on guardian.co.uk  FREE AppDownload
I live in Houston, which has been a huge economic beneficiary of the sustained increases in oil prices, drilling, refining and related processes. As such, the amount of wealth created in energy-related investments has been enormous and, not surprisingly, a vast majority of individuals have overweighted portfolios in energy with the expectations that"oil prices can only go up."  Of course, this sentiment is certainly understandable when you look at the performance of the energy sector versus the S&amp;P 500 since the turn of the century. (Annualized return, capital appreciation only: S&amp;P 500 3.24% vs Energy 17.71%) StreetTalk LIVE Strongly rising asset prices, and in this case commodity prices, have driven investor exuberance in the sector leading many to ignore deteriorating fundamentals, excessive leverage, and other financial diseases. However, when prices deteriorate rapidly, investment mistakes are quickly revealed. It is important to remember that we are not investors. We are speculators placing bets on the direction of the price of an electronic share. More importantly, we are speculating, more commonly known as gambling, with our "savings." We are told by Wall Street that we "must" invest into the financial markets to keep those hard-earned savings adjusted for inflation over time. Unfortunately, due to repeated investment mistakes, the average individual has failed in achieving this goal. With this in mind, this is an excellent time to review 10 legendary investment lessons from legendary investors. These time-tested rules about "risk" are what have repeatedly separated successful investors from everyone else. (Quote Source: 25iQ) 1) Jeffrey Gundlach, DoubleLine "The trick is to take risks and be paid for taking those risks, but to take a diversified basket of risks in a portfolio." This is a common theme that you will see throughout this post. Great investors focus on "risk management" because "risk" is not a function of how much money you will make, but how much you will lose when you are wrong. In investing, or gambling, you can only play as long as you have capital. If you lose too much capital but taking on excessive risk, you can no longer play the game. Be greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others are greedy. One of the best times to invest is when uncertainty is the greatest and fear is the highest. 2) Ray Dalio, Bridgewater Associates "The biggest mistake investors make is to believe that what happened in the recent past is likely to persist. They assume that something that was a good investment in the recent past is still a good investment. Typically, high past returns simply imply that an asset has become more expensive and is a poorer, not better, investment.” Nothing good or bad goes on forever. The mistake that investors repeatedly make is thinking "this time is different." The reality is that despite Central Bank interventions, or other artificial inputs, business and economic cycles cannot be repealed. Ultimately, what goes up, must and will come down. Wall Street wants you to be fully invested "all the time" because that is how they generate fees. However, as an investor, it is crucially important to remember that "price is what you pay and value is what you get." Eventually, great companies will trade at an attractive price. Until then, wait.  3) Seth Klarman, Baupost “Most investors are primarily oriented toward return, how much they can make and pay little attention to risk, how much they can lose.”  Investor behavior, driven by cognitive biases, is the biggest risk in investing. "Greed and fear" dominate the investment cycle of investors which leads ultimately to "buying high and selling low." StreetTalk LIVE “You don’t get rewarded for taking risk; you get rewarded for buying cheap assets. And if the assets you bought got pushed up in price simply because they were risky, then you are not going to be rewarded for taking a risk; you are going to be punished for it.”  Successful investors avoid "risk" at all costs, even it means underperforming in the short-term. The reason is that while the media and Wall Street have you focused on chasing market returns in the short-term, ultimately the excess "risk" built into your portfolio will lead to extremely poor long-term returns. Like Wyle E. Coyote, chasing financial markets higher will eventually lead you over the edge of the cliff.   5) Jesse Livermore, Speculator “The speculator’s deadly enemies are: ignorance, greed, fear and hope. All the statute books in the world and all the rule books on all the Exchanges of the earth cannot eliminate these from the human animal….” Allowing emotions to rule your investment strategy is, and always has been, a recipe for disaster. All great investors follow a strict diet of discipline, strategy, and risk management. 6) Howard Marks, Oaktree Capital Management “Rule No. 1:  Most things will prove to be cyclical. – Rule No. 2:  Some of the greatest opportunities for gain and loss come when other people forget Rule No. 1.” As with Ray Dalio, the realization that nothing lasts forever is critically important to long term investing. In order to "buy low," one must have first "sold high." Understanding that all things are cyclical suggests that after long price increases, investments become more prone to declines than further advances.  7) James Montier, GMO "There is a simple, although not easy alternative [to forecasting]... Buy when an asset is cheap, and sell when an asset gets expensive.... Valuation is the primary determinant of long-term returns, and the closest thing we have to a law of gravity in finance." "Cheap" is when an asset is selling for less than its intrinsic value. "Cheap" is not a low price per share. Most of the time when a stock has a very low price, it is priced there for a reason. However, a very high priced stock CAN be cheap. Price per share is only part of the valuation determination, not the measure of value itself. 8) George Soros, Soros Capital Management “It’s not whether you’re right or wrong that’s important, but how much money you make when you’re right and how much you lose when you’re wrong.” Back to risk management, being right and making money is great when markets are rising. However, rising markets tend to mask investment risk that is quickly revealed during market declines. If you fail to manage the risk in your portfolio, and give up all of your previous gains and then some, then you lose the investment game. 9) Jason Zweig, Wall Street Journal “Regression to the mean is the most powerful law in financial physics:Periods of above-average performance are inevitably followed by below-average returns, and bad times inevitably set the stage for surprisingly good performance.”  The chart below is the 3-year average of annual inflation-adjusted returns of the S&amp;P 500 going back to 1900. The power of regression is clearly seen. Historically, when returns have exceeded 10% it was not long before returns fell to 10% below the long-term mean which devastated much of investor's capital. StreetTalk LIVE “The biggest investing errors come not from factors that are informational or analytical, but from those that are psychological.”  The biggest driver of long-term investment returns is the minimization of psychological investment mistakes. As Baron Rothschild once stated: "Buy when there is blood in the streets." This simply means that when investors are "panic selling," you want to be the one that they are selling to at deeply discounted prices. The opposite is also true. As Howard Marks opined: “The absolute best buying opportunities come when asset holders are forced to sell.” As an investor, it is simply your job to step away from your "emotions" for a moment and look objectively at the market around you. Is it currently dominated by "greed" or "fear?" Your long-term returns will depend greatly not only on how you answer that question, but to manage the inherent risk.  “The investor’s chief problem – and even his worst enemy – is likely to be himself.” - Benjamin Graham This article originally appeared at STA Wealth Management.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global fund managers are most concerned about deflation in the coming year, according to Bank of America Merill Lynch. While the collapse of commodities caused by a rapid decline in China's economy was investors' biggest concern last December, deflation wasn't explicitly on their radar. "Interestingly, at the end of 2013, investors had started to become uneasy about the risk of inflation," wrote BAML's Savita Subramanian in the firm's US Equity Strategy Year Ahead for 2015. But their concerns are quite different one year later. The responses below from a separate poll question showed that investors are specifically concerned about deflation risks stemming out of the Eurozone. Bank of America Merrill LynchThe European Central Bank is struggling to fight off deflation, as several member countries have posted negative Consumer Price Index readings in recent months.  And while the US continues to post a positive CPI reading, the Federal Reserve recently expressed concern about inflation being below its 2% target. It remains something that they are watching closely in the run up to raising interest rates. Personal consumption expenditures, or PCE – the Fed's preferred measure of inflation – rose 2.2% in the third quarter. Bank of America forecasts core CPI at 1.8% for the fourth quarter of 2014 and for each quarter in 2015. Here's how Subramanian described their outlook for inflation in the US: "While other regions, such as Europe and Japan, are struggling to fight off deflation, US inflation remains in the sweet spot of 1.3% inflation, where market returns have historically been the strongest. While headline CPI may moderate and even temporarily fall below 1% due to commodity fluctuations, we expect core CPI to remain well above 1% over the next several years. Longer term inflation expectations retraced over the last few months to 1.9%." Deflation is a troubling phenomenon. While consumers might like falling prices, it encourages everyone to hold off on spending, which in turn leads to even lower prices. This causes economic activity to grind lower. FREE AppDownload
The city of Detroit was set to pay off creditors on Wednesday as it officially exits the biggest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history. Following are steps leading to the city's "rock bottom" point of December 2013, when it was declared eligible for Chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy, and milestones in the ensuing court process and bankruptcy exit. - Detroit's descent into fiscal insolvency can be traced back to the waning days of long-time Mayor Coleman Young's administration (1974-93), when the city was already deep in debt and struggling with a budget deficit. Both Young and the Michigan state treasurer raised concerns over potential bankruptcy. Moody's Investors Service cut the city's debt rating to "junk" in July 1992. - Mayor Dennis Archer's administration (1994-2001) brought a mini-renaissance, as new developments including casinos and baseball and football stadiums bolstered the city's budget. Credit ratings rose to solid investment-grade levels. - Budget deficits and late financial audits popped up during Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick's term (2002-08), prompting city officials to fret about a potential takeover by the state of Michigan. Credits ratings on some of the city's bonds fell again into the "junk" category. In September 2008, Kilpatrick left office after pleading guilty to obstruction of justice charges. Former basketball star Dave Bing won the May 5, 2009, election for mayor. - The U.S. Census reported in March 2011 that Detroit's population fell in 2010 to 713,777 - a 100-year low and a 25 percent decline from 2000. The drop threatened key tax revenue sources that were tied to a population of at least 750,000. William Wei, Business InsiderAn abandoned Detroit home. - Michigan Governor Rick Snyder in June 2011 signed legislation allowing Detroit to continue collecting income and utility taxes. Bing warned in November 2011 that Detroit faced a projected cash shortfall of about $150 million by the end of March 2012. - On Dec. 2, 2011, Michigan launched a preliminary review of Detroit's finances, citing the looming cash crunch. It found the city had a mounting debt problem with long-term liabilities estimated to top $12 billion compared with an annual budget of about $3.1 billion. - Moody's downgraded Detroit's credit ratings deeper into "junk" on March 20, 2012, triggering the costly termination of interest rate swap agreements. - In March 2012, about half of Detroit's unions accepted pay cuts and other concessions to save the city $68 million annually. In July, Bing imposed 10 percent pay cuts on workers. - In December 2012, state officials, concerned about the slow pace of reforms, launched a preliminary review ofDetroit's finances. The review team concluded Detroit had a serious financial problem, triggering a deeper probe that led to the appointment of an emergency financial manager. - An audit released on Jan. 3, 2013, showed Detroit's cumulative deficit jumped to $326.6 million at the end of fiscal2012 on June 30, from $196.6 million in fiscal 2011. - On Feb. 19, 2013 the review team concluded that Detroit faced a fiscal emergency. The report said the city was plagued by "operational dysfunction" and that it continued to deplete cash reserves and faced a cash deficit of $100 million by June 30 without significant spending cuts. Rebecca Cook /ReutersLaborer Brian Kuhn paints over graffiti on a blighted building near downtown Detroit in Detroit, Michigan, December 10, 2014.- On March 1 2013, Snyder cleared the way for a state takeover of Detroit's finances by accepting the team's fiscalemergency determination. He also said he had a top candidate for the job of emergency financial manager. - On March 14, 2013, Snyder appointed bankruptcy and restructuring lawyer Kevyn Orr as Detroit's emergency financial manager. Orr said he hoped the city would emerge from bankruptcy before his term expired in October 2014. - In June 2013, Orr unveiled a proposal that called for minimal recoveries to unsecured creditors, including the city's two pension funds and certain bondholders. Detroit also defaulted on $1.4 billion of pension debt. - Detroit filed the biggest-ever Chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy on July 18, 2013. - Detroit defaulted on more than $600 million of general obligation bonds in October 2013. - Detroit was formally declared bankrupt in December 2013, a landmark ruling by U.S. Judge Steven Rhodes, who cited the city's dismal finances and $18 billion debt. About 40 percent of the city's streetlights did not work and about 78,000 abandoned buildings littered the city.

REUTERS/ Rebecca CookThe Dow fell 268 points on Wednesday. First, the scoreboard: And now, the top stories on Wednesday: 1. Stocks took a beating. After falling early in the day on Tuesday and then turning around, stocks started Wednesday lower and took a turn for the worse in the afternoon, with the Dow losing as many as 285 points at one point. Stocks attempted to stage a rally in the last hour of trade, before falling back to session lows into the close. 2. Oil was again the lead story in the markets, as WTI and Brent crude both made fresh lows, with WTI breaking below $61 a barrel and Brent falling below $65 a barrel for the first time since 2009. At one point on Wednesday, WTI was down more than 5%. There were a number of bad headlines for oil on Wednesday, with OPEC's latest report showing a reduction in demand expectations for 2015, the US EIA's latest status report showing an unexpected increase in inventories last week, and comments from Saudi Arabian Minister of Petroleum Ali Al-Naimi that suggested a change in tone out of OPEC.  3. In an afternoon email, NYSE Floor Governor Rich Barry noted that on the floor of the NYSE, all traders can talk about is oil. "While the sell-off in crude has been a drubbing of historic proportions, we do not think it is over yet.," Barry wrote. "Look for more pain and a little more bloodletting before we see a real bottom in place. Or, to quote one esteemed market-player in expressing his views on commodity prices, 'The number of human beings in the history of mankind who could consistently and accurately predict future commodity prices is Zero.'"  4. And while the oil and equity markets were falling sharply on Wednesday, the VIX, or volatility index, spiked. The VIX climbed to nearly 20 on Wednesday, a rise of more than 20%, bringing the measure's gains to almost 50% since Friday, when it was trading closer to 11. Long-dated US treasury bonds also rallied on Wednesday, with the 10-year falling back below 2.2% to as low as 2.16%, and the 30-year extending its gains to as low as 2.82%.  5. On Tuesday, BlackRock released its 2015 investment outlook, and the firm is looking for a few main themes next year: volatility and standout US growth.  6. It was an ugly day overall for oil and gas stocks, with the some of big losers including Hess, Marathon Oil, Williams, Devon Energy, and Noble Energy, which all fell more than 4%. Some of the other notable S&amp;P 500 losers were Yum! Brands, which last night said its sales in China still continue to recover at a slower pace than expected.  Don't Miss: Jeff Gundlach's Presentation On The Changing World Of Investing »       FREE AppDownload
(Reuters) - Atlantic City is expected to slash a bond sale by 71 percent to $40 million because the multitude of uncertainties facing the city have made it difficult to borrow, a city official told Reuters on Wednesday. The struggling New Jersey gambling hub planned a mid-November bond sale of up to $140 million to refund old debt and pay for property tax appeals by overvalued casinos. But that deal is likely to be transformed to a note sale before the end of this calendar year and cut to just $40 million, Atlantic City revenue director Michael Stinson said. Four of the city's 12 casinos have shut their doors this year and another plans to close this month, due in part to increased competition from Pennsylvania and other nearby states. The closures have helped gut the city's tax base, jack up countywide job losses, and force the new mayor, Don Guardian, to plan hundreds of staff reductions through layoffs and attrition. "It's very difficult to go out to the capital markets when there are uncertain conditions affecting an issuer," Stinson said. "There are many, many uncertain issues affecting the city of Atlantic City." But the oceanfront resort town has some cards up its sleeve. It hopes to reap about $50 million by auctioning off tax liens for shuttered casinos on Thursday. The Revel Casino Hotel and Trump Plaza, both closed, and the Trump Taj Mahal, scheduled to close this month, together owe at least that much in unpaid taxes that the city desperately needs. The winning bidder pays the taxes, getting in exchange the right to foreclose if the property owner doesn't repay - with interest - within two years. If nobody buys the tax liens, the city could foreclose within six months, although the timeline could be complicated if the properties are still in bankruptcy at that time. Because of the potential for interest rates as high as 18 percent, hedge funds could be interested in the liens, Stinson said. The city may also get support from a package of bills moving forward in the state legislature. One measure, aimed at ensuring a steadier revenue stream for the city, would allow casinos to make set payments in lieu of property taxes for 15 years.   FREE AppDownload
 Remember when OPEC was a cartel that attempted to stabilize oil prices by manipulating its production? No longer. Saudi Arabian Minister of Petroleum Ali Al-Naimi made a surprising statement at a UN climate-change meeting in Lima, Peru. "Why should I cut production? You know what a market does for any commodity. It goes up and down and up and down,” Al-Naimi said, according to Bloomberg. This is interesting, as Al-Naimi is ostensibly the most powerful man in the cartel that has been manipulating the global oil market since 1960. The whole point of OPEC is to use collective action, through tightly controlling the world's oil supply, to counteract the market forces that Al-Naimi is now saying should be allowed to move freely. This comment came on the same day that OPEC lowered its demand expectations for next year to 28.9 million barrels a day, a cut of about 300,000 barrels. It's the lowest the forecast has been since 2002. OPEC gave two reasons: The first is increased production around the world (mostly coming from shale production in North America). The second is reduced demand. As technology is improving for oil extraction, it's doing the same for energy efficiency. In November, OPEC decided not to cut production despite these market forces, to the detriment of the economies of many of its poorer member countries like Venezuela, Ecuador, and Nigeria. The price of oil has been falling since June, when it was roughly $105 per barrel, with particularly steep drops in October and November. No one is sure exactly why the price slid so rapidly, but it's now down to around $60 per barrel and doesn't show any signs of recovering.  The price of oil hit new relative lows this morning. Here's the chart for WTI crude: Finviz This new stance by Al-Naimi is likely a political tactic. Saudi Arabia wants the price of oil to go low enough that American producers in the newly drilled shale basins aren't making any money. Then they might stop flooding the market, giving Saudi Arabia back its position as the world oil leader. Saudi Arabia's tactics are working, too. The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) recently reduced its forecast for production growth in 2015 by 100,000 barrels a day.     FREE AppDownload
David Ganek, the founder of now-closed hedge fund Level Global, said today's court decision to toss the insider trading convictions of two hedge fund managers is "vindication," but a lot of folks still lost their reputations and jobs.  "For the dozens of my high-integrity colleagues at Level Global who lost their jobs and their reputations because the FBI improperly raided our firm in this now-discredited fishing expedition, today's legal vindication is a reminder how prosecutorial recklessness has real impact on real people," Ganek, who now runs Apocalypse 22, said in a statement.  On Wednesday, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the insider-trading convictions of hedge-fund managers Todd Newman and Anthony Chiasson.  It was a really high-profile case. Newman, an ex-Diamondback Capital portfolio manager, Chiasson, the cofounder of Level Global, were codefendants accused of trading on inside information in Dell and Nvidia stocks. The two hedge-funders were arrested in January 2012 and convicted in May 2013. Level Global, which Chiasson and Ganek cofounded in 2003, was a Connecticut-based hedge fund that once managed around $4 billion in assets. The firm became a casualty of the government's massive insider trading crackdown. Reuters/ Mike SegarAnthony Chiasson In November 2010, the FBI raided Level Global and Diamondback. One source present at the Level Global office during the raid described it to Business Insider as "surreal."  Following that raid, Level Global closed its doors in 2011 and roughly 65 of the fund's employees lost their jobs. In 2013, Level Global agreed to pay the Securities and Exchange Commission $20.5 million to settle insider trading charges. Today's court decision is seen as "bittersweet," a former Level Global employee tells us.  "The whole thing today is bittersweet. I'm happy for Anthony [Chiasson]. He's a great guy, a good dad and husband and friend, too."  "This exoneration is good for Anthony," the source said. "But we'll never be able to get our reputations back. I think that's clear." The source explained that it's been difficult for many of the former employees to find a job, or a position equal to the one they had before at Level Global.  "A lot of people got hurt. My life had been turned upside down. Reputations are just destroyed. You can't get a job."  So even though the charges have been reversed, the saga isn't over for people who worked at Level Global. It may never be over. FREE AppDownload
 Wall Street's top-tier research departments have largely avoided the marijuana-legalization conversation because it hasn't really affected the stocks they cover. The big tobacco companies have also been tight-lipped about the issue. But RBC Capital Markets' US tobacco-research team thinks that the current progress toward legalized weed means that Big Tobacco could soon have to start answering questions about this. Here's an excerpt from a research note that was just circulated: Dialogue on marijuana mountingDuring the elections this past November, Oregon, Washington DC and Alaska joined Colorado and Washington in essentially legalizing the recreational use of marijuana. Today there are 27 states, as well as Washington DC, which have legalized marijuana in some form or have decriminalized the drug. A few additional states are slated to do the same next year. Today, for the first time ever (according to the PEW Research Center), the majority of Americans believe marijuana should be legal—a likely critical topic for the 2016 presidential election. With this quickly changing view of marijuana across the US, we believe it is only a matter of time until investors start asking questions about how it will fit into the bigger picture. And while every tobacco company management we have spoken to on this topic has been unwilling to discuss it, we believe full federal legalization of marijuana in the US would likely lead tobacco companies to reconsider this space. And by "reconsider this space," the analysts mean that big tobacco companies like Reynolds American, Lorillard, and Altria will need to start running the cost/benefit numbers soon. Here are some marijuana facts from RBC: Those second and third points are crucial because they mean more and more marijuana-friendly politicians will be voted into office to push through this legislation.

At the end of their first year at Stanford University, a half dozen students snagged an apartment-style dormitory on the third floor of Griffin House, overlooking the campus golf course. A little over a year later, in the autumn of 2014, just two were left at Stanford. The others had gone to work on their startups. They had a big advantage: Fellow roommate Chris Barber, 21, was a budding venture capitalist, already learning about the business of injecting funds into promising new firms. He funded companies run by three of his roommates. Long one of America’s elite universities, Stanford has grown into the leading alma mater, by far, for entrepreneurs receiving early-stage funding from top venture capital firms. What most outsiders don’t see: how early the investment community starts cultivating Stanford students, how committed the students are, and how deeply the VC culture has burrowed its way onto campus. At Stanford now, venture capitalists are teaching, investing in students’ startups, volunteering as mentors, occasionally even visiting the dorms. Professor-turned-VC Balaji Srinivasan visited Griffin House last autumn, shortly before he joined top venture firm Andreessen Horowitz. He was invited to discuss the emerging currency bitcoin. The dedication can come with a price. Last year social gatherings at the suite, Griffin 304, were rare. A small fridge held mostly soda, not beer. For most of the academic year, Barber was the only roommate with a regular girlfriend. One of his roommates, Jesse Leimgruber, complained that girls drain hours in the late evening, “the most productive time for a startup.” For VCs, the attraction of academia is simple: Some of the hottest tech start-ups are founded by college kids. Student-run firms that met venture capital backers at Stanford include Snapchat, the photo-sharing service. Chief executive Evan Spiegel dropped out two years ago to work on the venture. His first VC backer, Jeremy Liew, is a Stanford alumnus. Jacob Silberberg / REUTERSGoogle founders Larry Page and Sergey BrinPerhaps most famously, Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin were Stanford graduate students. They met their first investor through an introduction from Professor David Cheriton, who also ended up investing. Some on campus find the industry’s reach troubling. The students’ focus on doing business, they say, distracts from the scholarly mission of college and opens up instructors to potential conflicts of interest. The venture money also provides a temptation to drop out. “VCs can be a bad influence and are not a good role model for students,” says Vivek Wadhwa, a fellow at Stanford’s Rock Center for Corporate Governance. Faculty members who aren’t venture capitalists counter that VCs provide invaluable real-world insights. Stanford’s graduation rates have dipped somewhat in recent years. Of students who enrolled in 2009, 90 percent had graduated within five years, Stanford said, compared with a five-year graduation rate of 92.2 percent five years earlier. Some students say they are quitting to start companies. Stanford says it doesn’t track the reasons students leave. Reuters asked Stanford President John Hennessy whether there would be a conflict of interest if a Stanford instructor offered a student an implicit incentive, in the form of venture cash, to leave school. “It’s clearly at some level a conflict,” says Hennessy. “It’s not a direct conflict, but it is a worrisome issue.” Late last year, the university introduced a formal policy to govern faculty investments in student companies. If a faculty member has direct involvement in the student’s academic program, the investment requires approval, including from the vice provost and dean of research. The new policy states “The strong presumption is that such involvement would constitute a significant conflict of interest that could not be mitigated or managed and that it would therefore not be permitted.” It applies only to people with full-time positions. A Stanford spokeswoman said no requests for approval have been made by faculty members. Some investor-professors bristle at the notion they are buttressing their portfolios with projects from current students. The vast majority of junior students stick around to earn their degrees, and most don’t start companies, they point out. At the School of Engineering, the department that has done the most to welcome venture capitalists in roles such as instructor, adviser or guest lecturer, faculty members say VCs serve a valuable pedagogical purpose. “If someone wants to go deep, getting a practitioner like a venture capitalist to talk about what they do works,” says Tom Byers, an engineering professor and director of the Stanford Technology Ventures Program. “Every instructor invites a venture capitalist into their classroom in that vein.” ReutersStanford University's campus is seen from atop Hoover Tower in Stanford, California May 9, 2014.  A career in venture capital normally follows years of entrepreneurial success. Barber, the young Stanford student, got into the game early after a chance encounter at a conference. The lanky Australian computer science major had been drawn by Stanford’s reputation as an entrepreneurial hotbed. But after enrolling in the autumn of 2012, he became disenchanted with the focus on consumer companies he saw among fellow students. Inventions such as smartphone apps struck him as frivolous, relatively easy to get off the ground and creating uncertain value. Ideas for companies geared to serving businesses, by contrast, seemed to struggle to take flight. Their founders could use an experienced entrepreneur to guide them, he decided, as well as more mutual support. That summer he crashed a conference given by 500 Startups, a popular program for entrepreneurs. At lunch, he found himself sitting next to Matt Mochary, a 46-year-old who started a technology-services company in the 1990s and was now involved in the early-stage funding known as “angel” investing. Mochary learned Barber was couch-surfing and invited Barber to stay with him and his family. As he got to know Mochary, Barber decided the former technology executive could take on the role of adviser to students who wanted to create business-oriented companies. “The original idea was to meet a bunch of people students could go work with,” says Barber. “To have a network of people.” In turn, Barber let Mochary in on the earliest stage of companies imaginable - when they amount to little more than a dorm room bull-session. Mochary offered Barber a deal: The Stanford junior could invest up to $10,000 of Mochary’s cash on his own. Larger investments required Mochary’s approval. Barber would get 10 percent of any returns. Barber was to invest in two businesses set up by his room-mates: NeoReach, a marketing firm founded by Leimgruber; and an identity-verification company, BlockScore. Most enterprise startups take at least a couple of years to get off the ground, but he and Mochary say interest from bigger institutional investors in their startups is promising. By late last year, Barber had convinced Mochary to come coach his classmates. The two launched an informal course, Focus.VC, which they taught from January to April. Mochary presented major concepts such as time management and business development. Barber mastered specialized software and other startup tools, so he could help novice entrepreneurs with specifics like payroll. At the course’s end, many of the students pitched to professionals, including representatives from several top Silicon Valley firms brought in by Mochary. Four of seven companies that presented raised money from investors. Another Focus.VC and Griffin House company, BlockScore, lined up funding days beforehand. The young entrepreneurs attributed the program’s success to the coaching they got and to Mochary’s Silicon Valley contacts. “Every actual problem you’ll have, he’ll open up his network,” says Leimgruber. Mochary put in a good word for him with Founder.org, a seed fund that specializes in student-run startups. It eventually invested, drawn by Mochary’s reference and the accomplishments of the founders, said Tony Ayaz, chief revenue officer at Founder. When they weren’t in class or working on their startups, the inhabitants of Griffin 304 debated ideas long into the night. “To me, this is so much more fun than going to a party,” said BlockScore co-founder Alan Meier. “Because it’s lasting.” BlockScore helps financial-services companies verify customer identities. By last April, Meier and his Stanford partner John Backus faced a dilemma. They had to deliver a crucial computer-science assignment at the same time as writing a presentation they’d been invited to make to potential investors through an off-campus program for startups, Plug &amp; Play. They decided to divide the workload. Backus took a software-writing assignment for the computer-science class and Meier tackled the presentation. They got an A- for the computer-science project, and $2 million in venture capital funding from top firms such as Battery Ventures and Khosla Ventures. That’s an outcome most student entrepreneurs won’t reach for years. The duo felt compelled to leave Stanford to work full time on the business, which they co-founded with a more experienced entrepreneur. “It just got to a point where it was BlockScore priority, school second,” said Meier. In that decision, they joined another roommate, Ryan Breslow, who had already decided to take advantage of Stanford's leave of absence policy to work on his bitcoin company. (A sixth roommate who was due to share Griffin House had ducked out even before the year started, to work on his alternative energy company.) When Backus and Meier needed somebody to guarantee the lease on their new apartment, Mochary stepped in. BlockScore invited Barber and Mochary to invest. They also tapped another venture capitalist with close ties to Backus - his father, a partner at New Atlantic Ventures and a Stanford alumnus. The elder Backus says he has mixed feelings about his son’s ditching school for a startup. “The dad part of me says, ‘You got into Stanford, now get your degree,’” says Backus Sr. “The VC part of me says, ‘You’re doing it right.’” Down the hall at Griffin House, Leimgruber was determined to stick to his studies. The son of a Florida auto-body worker, he and his older brother, PJ, were the first two in the family to go to college. He started the company with PJ and another classmate who did not return to Stanford this semester. The Leimgrubers’ mother now works for NeoReach, which helps companies market themselves through word-of-mouth on social media. “School is my main priority. Always,” Leimgruber said in June. NeoReach eats up around eight hours of his day, he said. Its biggest investor was Founder.org, the fund that specializes in student startups. “They told us to stay in school,” Leimgruber said. “That’s a key reason we went with them.” In early August, Leimgruber almost quit Stanford. The Valley Fund, a venture-capital firm run by Stanford instructor Alex Gould and partner Steve O’Hara, offered to invest $3 million in his company. Gould has never taught Leimgruber, both say. Leimgruber thought about taking the money. He felt it would bring an obligation to leave Stanford to focus fully on the business. But he also felt every month in school carries an opportunity cost that could make the difference between developing a company worth millions and one worth billions. By December, he was “99 percent moving forward” with taking the cash. Either way, Leimgruber now says he won’t be coming back to Stanford next semester, but he expects to take advantage of the flexible leave of absence policy and return in the next few years. That means of the original Griffin House gang, only Barber will return next quarter. “It’s a great outcome,” he said about the suite and the accomplishments of his roommates. “If current freshmen or grad students are considering doing something similar, I’d strongly support it.” FREE AppDownload
 It's now undeniable that Chinese President Xi Jinping's corruption crackdown will change Macau's casino business forever. Cheung Chi Tai, a powerful junket operator, is being investigated for money laundering. The FBI had been monitoring him as an alleged member of the Triad, China's fearsome mafia, since 1992. He was once the largest shareholder of one of Macau's biggest junkets, Neptune Guangdong Group, and continues to have ties to the company. As the investigation proceeds, Cheung's assets have been frozen, according to The Wall Street Journal. In other words, Hong Kong regulators are very serious this time, and if someone as powerful as Cheung can go down in flames, no one in Macau's junket world is immune. Junkets made $30 billion for Macau last year by providing financing for casino high rollers — mostly from mainland China. That's about 70% of Macau's casino revenue, according to Reuters. Investors give junket operators money in exchange for guaranteed returns of about 1% to 2%. However, since this spring, when one junket operator stole $1 billion in cash from the pool, investors have wanted higher returns for perceived additional risk. This has already started breaking down the island's casino industry. At first, analysts were hopeful, believing that a free fall in casino revenue that started this summer would somehow find a stopping point, or that a higher volume of retail gamblers would make up for lost high rollers. But none of that has happened.  Reuters Wall Street is coming to terms with the idea that Macau's business model is "near broken."  And, after this arrest, it seems the Chinese government doesn't have a problem with that. Even as the country's economy slows, Xi Jinping is still cracking down on the powerful and dangerous people who, like Cheung, make this moneymaking system work. This will eventually have an effect on American casino companies that have made more money from Macau than from Las Vegas the past few years.  Companies such as Wynn, Las Vegas Sands, and MGM Grand have created separate subsidiaries for their Macau businesses, but they're still subject to US laws, like the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Regulators are investigating Sands over allegations of bribery in Macau, and Wynn has disclosed that it is being investigated for alleged violations of the FCPA. If found guilty, the Nevada Gaming Control Board could revoke their licenses. All these companies have ties to the junkets, of course. Some junkets have even brought revenue to Las Vegas. Cheung's Neptune is one of three Macau junkets that have been allowed to bring high rollers to Las Vegas, something Nevada regulators have been watching with mounting concern.  Wynn and MGM both used Neptune chairman, Lin Cheuk Fung, as an agent from 2005 to 2009. That means Lin arranged for wealthy gamblers to head to MGM and Wynn casinos to play. The problem is that it's not a very transparent process, and regulators don't have a full handle on who those gamblers are. "We're getting to understand the junkets and how the VIP rooms operate," Nevada Gaming Control Board member A.G. Burnett told Reuters in October. "We haven't decided whether that's offensive to the way we operate." In Cheung's case, Nevada may be much closer to coming to a decision. One of his companies has been connected to an illegal World Cup gambling ring that was busted in Las Vegas this summer. Eight people were arrested in the sting, and based on computers and cellphones that federal agents collected from the Caesars Palace villas where they stayed, Cheung's companies were helping the alleged ring settle up with gamblers. What all this means is that once-thought-untouchable junket operators need to be on their guard from now on, and Macau's VIP rooms will suffer for that.    FREE AppDownload
Screenshot/Bloomberg NewsBen EdelmanA Harvard Business School professor has finally apologized about his email to a Chinese restaurant ranting about the legality of being overcharged $4 for takeout, but he did make a good point about consumer protection. HBS associate professor Ben Edelman criticized Chinese restaurant Sichuan Garden and restaurateur Ran Duan, who manages the connecting Baldwin Bar, for supposedly overcharging him $4. Edelman said he had alerted local Boston authorities about the out-of-date menu on Sichuan Garden's website and Duan's initial offer to refund him just $3. Overwrought as his response may have seemed, he wasn't entirely wrong to call out Sichuan Garden — mostly because no one else probably would. In a statement to Business Insider before his apology, Edelman stressed "the benefit that all diligent consumers provide in looking for overcharges and other errors." Whether or not contacting local authorities was the right move, Edelman had a point. It's not likely that someone else would have called out the restaurant on having out-of-date prices on its website, which many of the customers use as a reference for ordering food. Additionally, as Edelman emphasized, Duan even said the website had been "out of date for quite some time." Many customers likely ended up paying more money than they expected to due to advertised prices that were no longer applicable. Outside of his position as a HBS professor, Edelman has established himself as an advocate for consumers. One case pitted him against an airline industry — a fight that was, in some ways, not unlike his dispute with the Chinese restaurant (though the airline industry is a less sympathetic foe than a small business). Last year, the US Department of Transportation fined American Airlines $60,000 for repeatedly misleading consumers about supposed "taxes" that were actually just airline-imposed surcharges, Consumer Traveler reports. According to the travel news website, "Though AA's actions have evidently been continuing for some time, the complaint began with a letter from Edelman to the DOT in January of last year." Edelman details his research into airline pricing practices on his personal website. As Consumer Travel notes, "Actual formal complaints submitted to DOT each year can be counted on one hand." If the airline had actually been wrongly charging consumers for a while, and no one was taking action to correct them, they likely would have continued their fraudulent practices without change. Edelman addressed his previous work with the airline industry in his statement to Business Insider, noting that he's "been pretty diligent in holding large companies accountable for their false statements of price and other attempts to overcharge passengers." With regards to Sichuan Garden, he writes, "Should all small businesses get a free pass? Some people seem to think so, I wonder if that really makes sense." Here's how Nobel-prize winning economist Alvin Roth described Edelman's relationship with the internet in a Bloomberg Businessweek article on the newly-infamous HBS professor earlier this year — "It's the Wild West out there, and Ben is the sheriff." That label could also apply to Edelman's relationship to businesses, large and small. FREE AppDownload
The magnitude of this year's oil price plunge has been unusual, making it particularly challenging for investors to assess how falling prices will impact corporate earnings and ultimately the stocks they're invested in. We can certainly expect companies to say a lot when they discuss their Q4 (Oct.-Dec.) financial results in January. For now, Wall Street's stock gurus are hacking away at their earnings growth forecasts for the energy sector. "As the price of crude oil has continued to decline during the fourth quarter (to $66.81 yesterday from $91.16 on September 30), analysts have also continued to lower earnings estimates for companies in the Energy sector in the S&amp;P 500 for the fourth quarter," FactSet's John Butters writes. FactSetEnergy sector earnings don't look good.Currently, analysts expects S&amp;P 500 energy sector earnings to plunge 14.6% to $9.49 per share in Q4, which compares to the 6.6% increase to $11.94 expected in September 30. According to Butters, this represents "the largest decline in the EPS estimate for the Energy sector during a quarter since Q1 2009." The good news is that the energy sector, while big, represents just one relatively small part of the diversified collection of big US companies in the S&amp;P 500. Indeed, analysts expect 3.4% earnings growth for the index as a whole in Q4. As far as the top line is concerned, revenues are expected to dive 13.7% in the energy sector, while the S&amp;P 500 as a whole sees a 1.5% increase. FactSetEnergy sector revenues look terrible.

Shane FerroGoodbye, debit card. A decade later, I found myself still banking at what has become Chase. There were a couple of reasons for this: I've lived in New York since I was 18, and there are branches everywhere. Even though Chase charges you to use a non-Chase ATM, it rarely presented a huge problem because there's generally one within a few blocks. I don't really use my bank account or debit card that often. Anything I can pay for with a credit card, I do, so that I can rack up airline miles (I pay off my balance in full at the end of every month). My checking-account transactions are basically limited to paying off my credit card, paying my rent, and paying my utility bills. So I only really think about my bank when I need cash. Justin Sullivan/GettyThere's a $2 fee to use any non-Chase ATM. My mom never lost access to it, so my parents could send me money automatically without having to wait for an ACH transfer or a check in the mail. This was helpful in college, when she would send me money every once in a while, but isn't really anymore — woo-hoo, adulthood! (For Christmas, I'll teach my mom to use Venmo.) The point is that Chase was, at one point, minorly convenient for me. But it's majorly inconvenient in a variety of ways: There's a $2 fee to use any non-Chase ATM, on top of whatever that machine charges you. Plus, the interest rates on my checking and savings accounts were terrible. I had always just been too lazy to close my account. Then, over the weekend, Reuters reporter Lauren LaCapra tweeted this: So Chase now charges $5 to take cash out of a non-Chase ATM. Is that aggressive or am I crazy? It turned out to be not quite true — she later clarified that this fee applies only to ATMs outside of the US. But it annoyed me at just the right time, and I decided it was time to break up with my bank. It took me a total of about 20 minutes over a couple of days. Here's how to do it, for anyone fed up with any of the big banks' hidden fees, horrible customer service, and paltry interest rates. This is a helpful list if you don't have any idea where to turn. Definitely consider a credit union. I didn't really have to choose. I've had a savings account with Ally for several years, because it has one of the best interest rates around for savings accounts (currently 0.9%). I'd already opened a checking account there as well, for some money I had wanted to segregate a while back. If you don't have an extra account, call or go to the website of the bank you choose and open one. It takes about five minutes. I like Ally because there aren't monthly maintenance fees or account minimums. Annnnd ... there are no ATM fees. None. What you get charged by other ATMs, Ally reimburses you for. Screenshot ally.com The downside is there are no physical branches, so depositing checks can be a pain (you take a photo of the check with your phone, then it takes a couple of days to clear). But at this point I deposit maybe five checks a year. It's helpful to wait until you get your new debit card in the mail before moving on to Step 2. My rent and my utility bills automatically come out of my bank account, but that's about it, so it was really easy to go onto those websites and change my direct-deposit settings. Speaking of direct deposit, don't forget how you get paid. I also had to go into Business Insider's HR site and change my payment allocations. One click and it's over! Wait on this until the other steps above are done, though, if your bank requires a minimum balance in your account. They will ask you why. They will try to persuade you to stay. Stay firm. I found that when I said "I'm leaving because I found a higher interest rate elsewhere," there was nothing they could come back at me with. The sales associate smiled. He asked me what interest rate I was getting at my new bank — was it close to 1%? I said yes, and he got to work. Some typing on a keyboard for about a minute, and it was over. I folded my debit card in half, and I was done! Instagram/videofyme      FREE AppDownload
On Wednesday, Brent crude broke $64 a barrel while WTI crude broke $61 for the first time since 2009. Both benchmark oil indexes were down more than 4%.  Brent got as low as $63.72. WTI got as low as $60.55. Here's the WTI chart from Wednesday, with the latest plunge coming after the US Energy Information Administration's latest weekly status report.  It showed that weekly crude stocks were up 1.45 million barrels, against expectations for stocks to drop by 2.2 million barrels.  In short, there was an increase in stockpiled crude inventory last week. WTI, the US benchmark oil price, was down over 5%. And as you can see in the chart below, WTI briefly cracked the $61-a-barrel mark.   FinViz And each day that oil drops, the yearly chart of WTI gets more staggering. FinViz US stocks were also falling on Wednesday amid oil's decline, with the Dow losing more than 100 points.  This morning, Reuters reported that the falling oil prices have started to affect US domestic production, with the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) cutting its forecasted growth by 100,000 barrels per day, a move linked to generally weaker oil demand.  In its latest report released Wednesday, OPEC also reduced its global demand forecast to 28.9 million barrels per day, the lowest since 2002.  Increased US production and decreased demand have been cited as the culprits for crude's rapid decline over the last several months.  Both WTI and Brent crude are down more than 35% from their June highs, putting them firmly in bear-market territory.    FREE AppDownload
Investec via @WSJeurope(Reuters) - A research note published by South African bank Investec with the headline "I can't breathe" caused an outcry on social media on Wednesday for its use of the dying words of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man killed in a police chokehold. The Investec note focused on a decision by U.S. authorities to put British bank Standard Chartered under greater regulatory scrutiny. Ian Gordon, the analyst who wrote the note, said in it that the U.S. government exerted arguably disproportionate control and influence over Standard Chartered's business. Investec's compliance department approved the note after removing a more explicit comparison with the Garner case. The note prompted some sharp criticism. Benjamin Lawsky, New York's powerful banking regulator and one of the U.S. regulators who has acted against Standard Chartered, tweeted, "Terrible. Should be disavowed with apologies by Investec." Gordon was not immediately available to comment. A spokesman for Investec declined to comment. Garner's last words before he died in July have become a slogan for nationwide protests against police violence in the United States.     (Reporting by Carmel Crimmins, Matt Scuffham and Steve Slater.

Jim Watson/ReutersHillary Clinton delivers remarks during a news conference at the US Consulate in Vladivostok, Sept. 9, 2012. All the polls show her drubbing all known opponents. All the pundits seem to regard her as a shoo-in. Even Clinton's fundraisers seem to regard their biggest challenge as persuading donors that she does not have a lock on the election, thus emphasizing the need for these donors to give. No disrespect to Mrs. Clinton, but I think this consensus is wrong. I do not say this as a political expert. I am not a political expert. I am just an American. For fun, though, I just made a bet with a political expert, former editor in chief of Slate, Jacob Weisberg, that Clinton won't win. Jacob took the bet instantly and says he is looking forward to my buying him lunch in early November 2016. To be clear: Hillary Clinton is supremely well qualified to be president. She has strong experience, she's smart and capable, and she would probably do a great job. She is widely and deservedly respected and admired. She also has deep connections and an immense and talented political machine, one that has been gearing up for her campaign for years.  But despite this, unless the Republicans shoot themselves in the foot and nominate a champion of the extreme right, I don't think she'll get the job. Why not? Four reasons, none of which are insurmountable, two of which are politically incorrect: 1. Age 2. Gender 3. Track record, baggage, wonkiness 4. Relative lack of charm and likability A few words about each: Age. If Hillary Clinton is elected president in 2016, she will be the one of the oldest president-elects ever. Only Ronald Reagan was older. According to this chart from Wikipedia, the average age of incoming presidents is 54. Hillary Clinton would be 69. Ronald Reagan was also 69. And by the end of his second term, he was viewed as very old. (I'm not saying age should be a factor. I'm just saying it likely will be.) Wikipedia Track record, baggage, and wonkiness. History has shown that experience and wonkiness are not necessarily assets in American presidential elections. On the contrary, they are often liabilities. Al Gore had tremendous experience. It worked against him in the election, as did his voting record and wonkiness. (Americans chose the candidate who had no Federal voting record — and, thus, nothing to shoot at — and the candidate they would rather get a beer with, President Bush.)  Similarly, the candidate who eventually trumped Hillary Clinton in the 2008 primaries, Barack Obama, also had limited experience. But he was more charming and better at connecting with voters than Clinton was (see below). Lastly, a Clinton candidacy will be seen as "more of the same," and, given President Obama's approval ratings, that may not be a good thing.   Relative lack of inherent charm and likability. Hillary Clinton has radically improved her public-speaking prowess and campaigning ability over the years, and millions of Americans are crazy about her. But she still struggles to forge an emotional connection with average voters. This natural magnetism was her husband's greatest strength, and it propelled him to two election victories despite other flaws. As talented and sharp as she is, Hillary Clinton does not share this strength, and it leaves her exposed to more charismatic candidates. I like and admire Hillary Clinton. I'd be happy to consider voting for her (I'm undecided). I just don't think she'll win the 2016 election unless the Republicans shoot themselves in the foot.     FREE AppDownload
Rooftop space is among the most wasted space in the country, but solar energy is quickly changing that. According to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, if all of the residential and commercial rooftops were covered with solar panels the U.S. could produce 819 TW-hr of electricity annually, or about 22% of what's consumed every year. The only change that would be necessary is turning unproductive assets into productive, power-generating assets. Across the country, rooftops are being turned into power-generating assets, and the biggest change has come in Corporate America. Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) has been the quickest to go solar, with 105.1 MW installed, on its way to being 100% renewable by 2020.   Kohl's, Costco, Ikea, and Macy's are also among the biggest commercial solar installers. It's no coincidence that they're among the largest retailers in the country, which comes with an immense amount of rooftop space. SEIAThe other trend is tech companies using commercial space around data centers to produce solar electricity to power operations. Apple has moved fastest to go solar but Intel, Verizon, and AT&amp;T are also among the top 25 solar installers in Corporate America. There are a lot of solar companies looking into the commercial space, but SolarCity(NASDAQ: SCTY) and SunPower(NASDAQ: SPWR) are two of the largest. SolarCity recently introduced ZS Peak for commercial rooftops and ZS Beam for parking lot installations. It's working with partners such as Wal-Mart, Tesla Motors, and Google for solar installations.   One company that I think has incredible potential in commercial solar is SunPower, which makes the most efficient solar panels in the world. Higher efficiency means more energy can be squeezed out of each square foot of rooftop space. When combined with the higher lifetime energy production from SunPower's panels, the cost per watt can actually be lower for customers even if the initial costs are higher. This dynamic can make for a hard sell in the residential market, but sophisticated commercial solar buyers understand the long-term production dynamics of solar panels and are willing to pay for SunPower's advantage. I recently discussed exactly that with SunPower CEO Tom Werner. Being players in the commercial solar market is big for both SolarCity and SunPower, because this is a larger market than residential solar right now. According to GTM Research and SEIA, the U.S. installed 2.15 GW of commercial solar systems in the past year ended June 2014 to 1.56 GW of residential solar. The advantage for installers is that a single contract can be for multiple buildings, meaning tens of MWs in a single deal. That compares with the typical 5 kW rooftop solar system, which is sold to each individual household. Residential solar may get a lot of the attention in solar today, but commercial solar installations that use up unused rooftop space across the country will be a growth driver for the industry and may be an even bigger market than residential. That's big news for companies that can win business from increasingly knowledgeable customers. FREE AppDownload
Reuters/ Mike SegarAnthony Chiasson, cofounder of now-closed hedge fund Level Global. "Because the Government failed to present sufficient evidence that the defendants willfully engaged in substantive insider trading or a conspiracy to commit insider trading in violation of the federal securities laws, we reverse Newman and Chiasson's convictions and remand with instructions to dismiss the indictment as it pertains to them with prejudice," the opinion said.   Newman, an ex-Diamondback Capital portfolio manager, and Chiasson, the cofounder of now-defunct hedge fund Level Global, were codefendants accused of trading on inside information in Dell and Nvidia stocks. The two hedge-funders were convicted in May 2013. Today's court decision concluded that the "jury instructions were erroneous and that there was insufficient evidence to support the convictions" of Newman and Chiasson.  "Today’s decision is a resounding victory for the rule of law and for Anthony Chiasson personally," Chiasson's attorney Gregory Morvillo said in a statement. "Mr. Chiasson has always conducted himself according to the highest ethical and professional standards in service to many of the world’s leading hedge fund investors who were his clients for years.  He is deeply gratified that the decision issued today unequivocally re-establishes his innocence under the law – consistent with what Anthony has steadfastly maintained for the duration of this ordeal."  On the other hand, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, who has been cracking down on insider trading since 2009, probably isn't going to like this.  Here's the appellate court's opinion: Appeal from the United States District Court-- Newman and Chiasson       FREE AppDownload
 Alexa von Tobel is the leadership-award-winning, New York Times bestseller-writing, presidentially-recognized young entrepreneur who founded LearnVest. Her company is an online financial planning service geared primarily at millennials, who von Tobel says face more financial obstacles than any other generation. She sat down with OneWire's Skiddy von Stade to explain why financial planning is so challenging for millennials. "If you think about my grandfather... he paid for everything in cash. You can't really make that many financial mistakes if everything is paid for in cash," she said.  But today, young people have access to credit, which can complicate things. On average, millennials rack up $30,000 in student debt and $4,000-5,000 in credit card debt before even entering the workforce, von Tobel said.  Then, their mortgages are more leveraged than ever before. And when it comes to retirement planning, defined contribution plans put the responsibility on the young person, rather than their employer. All this means it's a lot easier for young people today to make mistakes. And there's very little affordable, accessible guidance for them. "I went to Harvard twice – didn’t matter. We literally didn’t learn a minute of financial education about personal finance,” von Tobel said. That's why she founded LearnVest. But the financial challenges millennials face also present greater opportunities for wealth creation, von Tobel said. She thinks the future for millennials is bright, so long as they do a few critical things: (1) Start saving for retirement early: "It's actually a topic for your 20s, not a topic for your 40s." (2) Understand the concept of investing: That means knowing when to take risks and what that looks like. (3) Get appropriate insurance: "The basics of financial planning are critical." (4) Understand what your means really are: We often hear about living within our means, "but actually defining what your means are – that's the gap." With a little guidance, this stuff is all very doable, says von Tobel. "It's not magic – it's math."

Never look like a schlub again. (You're welcome.) Insider Picks If you're wearing shorts, you should keep your shoes casual. Sperrys and other boat shoes are generally the go-to option. You can also go for casual sneakers like Vans or Supergas — and if you are so inclined, feel free to go for a brighter color here. Last, men's espadrilles are a good choice, too. They're breathable and light so they're best for a really hot day. Sperry Top-Sider Men's Authentic Original Boat Shoes — Price: $44.99 to $95.00 Vans Classic Authentic Men's Sneaker (white) — Price: $34.04 to $69.98 TOMS Men's Classic Rope Slip On — Price: $35.60 to $99.99 Insider Picks Sometimes you need to dress up your jeans, and other times you can go super casual. If it's the former, then get yourself some oxfords. But if you're doing the whole jeans-and-tee shirt thing, high top sneakers or even some printed sneakers work.

Chukkas are also a solid option — but don't try and buy some weird color. Occasionally, if you're in a particularly casual setting, some sort of basic sneakers are a nice option too. We recommend navy colored ones, as navy pairs nicely with the casual chino.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil's state-controlled oil firm Petrobras may have to hike fuel prices, cut spending or seek a capital injection from the government next year as a widening corruption probe threatens to temporarily leave it out of capital markets. Yet any of those steps would be difficult to implement and may not be enough to fully substitute international bond markets as the company's main funding source, said one banker who helped oversee some of the company's bond offerings in recent years. Last month, Petrobras &lt;petr4.sa&gt; delayed the release of third-quarter results after auditors refused to sign off on them following allegations that it systematically overpaid for assets and work by contractors. If auditors fail to approve its annual results by April, that could trigger early repayment of as much as $11 billion of bonds and a $5.8 billion local bank loan, according to another source briefed on the situation. To be sure, few expect Petrobras to default on its debt since it would likely negotiate a solution with bondholders and banks. But global bond investors are unlikely to participate in any new Petrobras bond offering until it provides properly audited financial information, UBS Securities and Morgan Stanley &amp; Co analysts said in reports. That means the company, formally known as Petróleo Brasileiro SA, may have to look elsewhere to keep funding its five-year, $220 billion investment plan, the largest in the global oil industry. While President Dilma Rousseff could allow Petrobras to hike gasoline prices next year, she would likely resist any effort to significantly scale back the plan because it is a key part of her administration's flagship infrastructure investment program. About 68 percent of the plan's financing has already been contracted, Moody's Investors Service recently said. "Take into account the corruption investigation, the risk perception and Petrobras' ongoing financial constraints and you see how its ability to generate cash is severely imperiled," said the banker, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. The difficulties in lining up financing underpin the headwinds facing Petrobras, which only 20 months ago sold $11 billion in bonds, a record for an emerging market firm. The corruption scandal, coupled with years of rampant debt-taking, is fanning concern that Petrobras could lose its coveted investment-grade status, driving up borrowing costs. Touted by government officials in the last decade as the crown jewel of Brazil's economy, Petrobras has now become a symbol of the country's fall from grace. The company plans to publish unaudited results on Friday, though that is unlikely to assuage concerns about the impact of the corruption probe on operations and fundraising plans. "I believe that no investor will buy shares or bonds with the current headline risk, at least not without the proper audited paperwork in place," said Ulisses de Oliveira, who helps manage $400 million in emerging market debt for Galloway Gestora de Recursos in São Paulo. The refinancing hurdles loom as oil prices are tumbling, threatening to crimp revenue. Free cash flow, a measure of cash surpluses after payments to bondholders and shareholders, is expected to turn positive only by 2017, analysts estimate. Petrobras, which declined to comment for this story, has yet to set a date to publish audited results. If Petrobras does manage to secure fresh funding, it will come at a higher cost because of the added risks stemming from the corruption scandal. Petrobras' 6.25 percent bond maturing in March 2024 &lt;71647NAM1=FINR&gt; is currently yielding close to 6.5 percent, the highest level in about a year and a half. That is in the same ballpark as issuers rated below investment grade.   OPERATION CAR WASH The scandal is also putting pressure on Rousseff, who was chairwoman of Petrobras' board between 2003 and 2010. The probe, dubbed "Operation Car Wash," was launched in March when police began probing an alleged money laundering scheme. New York-based law firm Wolf Popper LLP filed on Tuesday a class action lawsuit against Petrobras on behalf of investors who bought the company's U.S.-traded shares between May 2010 and November this year. The lawsuit, which alleges that Petrobras issued misleading statements that helped hide the corruption scheme, could further hamper the company's ability to access the U.S. market. Petrobras borrows about half of its $40 billion in annual capital spending, most of that from bond investors. It typically taps bond markets early in the year, having made a first-quarter global bond offering in five of the past eight years. Even if banks and investors in Brazil shrug off the risk of extending credit to Petrobras, local loan and bond markets are too small to supply the company with the financing it needs to undertake its projects, another banker said. The company could still turn to state development bank BNDES [BNDES.UL] for credit, but it is unclear if the bank would extend enough money to Petrobras. Petrobras could pay for operations for about six months without tapping debt markets, executives said last month. BNDES declined to comment. Petrobras, the world's most indebted oil firm with $140 billion in total liabilities, has $54 billion in outstanding bonds. Net debt is above the target for leverage at 2.5 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, and above the 35 percent of equity threshold. "With the recent decline in crude prices, down more than 30 percent from mid-year levels, we expect lower cash generation and this will make the company more reliant on asset sales or debt to fund future development spending," Moody's said. Shares are down about 47 percent since the investigation began gaining momentum three months ago. Chief Financial Office Almir Barbassa renewed a pledge not to sell new equity on November 17 when he outlined plans to review Petrobras accounting. FREE AppDownload

Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has called on Russians "not to panic" and to keep their savings in rubles despite the Russian currency's sharp decline. In an annual interview televised live on December 10, Medvedev said Western sanctions against Russia over its conduct in Ukraine had contributed to the fall of the ruble, which has fallen about 40 percent against the dollar this year and has plumbed new lows frequently in recent weeks. Medvedev reiterated Russian warnings that the sanctions are also harmful to European nations, saying European countries had lost up to $40 billion as a result. He said that "according to Russian experts' calculations, Europe will lose another $50 billion next year." Russian retaliation to the sanctions has included a ban on most food imports from nations that have hit it with sanctions. Medvedev said many Russians who had bet against the ruble in the past had often lost money in the long run. He also promised that the government would index pensions and state salaries to compensate for the ruble's fall, which has also been accelerated by a decline in world oil prices -- a major Russian export. But in another sign of Kremlin concerns that Russia's economic woes are causing discontent, President Vladimir Putin lashed out at energy companies on December 9 over rising gasoline prices. He said gasoline prices had risen about 10 percent over the previous year as of December 1, while oil prices have fallen sharply. Putin said: "How can that happen? And where is the Federal Anti-monopoly Service looking?"  Medvedev gave no sign that Russia would alter its behavior as a result of the sanctions, which were imposed over Moscow's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in March and its support for pro-Russian separatists whose conflict with government forces in eastern Ukraine has killed more than 4,300 people since April. He said Crimea was Russia's "destiny" and blamed the United States for the severe tension in the relationship between the nuclear-armed nations. "The current American administration  is behaving inappropriately and unpredictably," he said. He said "the Americans" are "imposing sanctions against our country, they are trying to hammer together an unfriendly front against Russia. These are unfriendly activities, this is absolutely evident."  FREE AppDownload
 BlackRock thinks the US economy could be an outlier in 2015. In its 2015 investment outlook, titled "Dealing With Divergence," BlackRock sees the US experiencing a "pickup in growth" and improving labor markets. Financial conditions in the US are also expected to tighten.  "US growth is on an upswing," the report said. "We expect the US Federal Reserve to start raising rates in 2015 and the yield curve to flatten." But this improvement out of the US will be a divergence from the world's other major financial markets and economies. While the eurozone, Japan, and China could maybe see some improvements, the firm is cautious on them for the most part. Europe might see a "surprise upside" — but that's only because expectations are at "rock bottom." Investors could see some short-term opportunities in Japanese stocks if there is additional monetary stimulus, but overall the long-term looks risky. As for China — it's going to be a major balancing act as the country attempts to mitigate its economic slowdown. Next year, BlackRock expects that financial conditions will ease and growth will slow in the world's second-largest economy. Additionally, BlackRock is expecting volatility to be a major feature of 2015. Regional "zero-sum conflicts" in places like Ukraine and the Middle East could be problematic, and "elevated valuations and a voodoo-like belief in momentum raise the costs of mistakes." It's always hard to predict what will actually happen, especially because the two major themes — volatility and divergence — are by definition unpredictable. And as BlackRock Chief Investment Strategist Russ Koesterich said at a media briefing attended by Business Insider on Tuesday: "The odds we get it right seem remote." As the firm says in its 2015 outlook: "The main point is to have a plan: Readiness rules in 2015." BlackRock   FREE AppDownload
HSBC is reminding all its customers this holiday season that if they don't pay their mortgages, the bank will take their homes. Here's the message, tweeted by an editor at The Guardian: Merry Christmas! Pay us or we'll take your home! pic.twitter.com/g0a9uxGt3Z  It reads: "Christmas. Home made. Thanks to over 100,000 of you who trusted us with your mortgages this year." The fine print reminds people: "Your home may be repossessed if you do not keep up repayments on your mortgage." It seems that HSBC doesn't trust its customers to keep up with their mortgage payments. It's a pretty jarring sentence to include with an otherwise benign holiday message.   FREE AppDownload
REUTERS/Maxim ShemetovRussia's Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina. Russia's central bank is set to meet on Thursday, and it only has bad options. Here's a quick overview of the problem facing Russian central bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina.  In a note ahead of the report, Nicholas Spiro of Spiro Sovereign Strategy sums up the problem as follows: With inflation in Russia veering towards 10%, the central bank — which is now an explicit inflation targeter — has little choice but to raise rates aggressively tomorrow. Yet its clear reluctance to hike rates given the severity of the economic downturn makes it extremely difficult for the central bank to get any meaningful market bang for its policy buck.  The less aggressive [Thursday's] rate hike is perceived to be, the more markets will question the central bank's commitment to defending the rouble. Yet the sharper the hike, the greater the concern about the economic sustainability of tighter monetary policy. Here is the overview of Russia's problem in three charts. Inflation is surging. tradingeconomics.com tradingeconomics.com Bloomberg.com And so the problem these three charts presents is this: When inflation rises too fast, central banks raise rates to fight this increase.  Raising interest rates can be thought of as an attempt to make money "more valuable," as higher rates make it more expensive to lend money. Raising rates is also referred to as "tightening" financial conditions.  And so by raising rates, a central bank is working to curb the supply of money, as inflation is the result of too much money chasing too few goods.  But since the ruble has been collapsing, Russia's rate increases aren't having the desired effect.  The Russian government has been defiant in the face of a declining ruble and an economy that appears headed towards recession in 2015. The official word out of Moscow has been that the declining value of the ruble, the increase in inflation, and the tumbling price of oil are all things Russia can overcome. And maybe they are. But on Thursday, Russia's central bank only seems to have bad options.  And so here is Russia's problem: Damned if you do, damned if you don't.       FREE AppDownload
Dr. Ed's Blog Late on Monday, China’s securities clearinghouse banned investors from using low-grade corporate bonds as collateral for short-term financing. The move is part of Beijing’s structural reforms aimed at shoring up the financial system.  The Shanghai Composite dropped 5.4% to 2,856.27, suggesting that the recent stock bubble may be bursting already. The retail-dominated market is still up 35% this year. The Chinese have a huge savings rate. They’ve cooled off to putting their money into properties and wealth-management products. Instead, they’ve been pouring funds into the stock market. Yesterday’s FTreported: “The balance of outstanding margin loans has risen more than two-thirds since the beginning of September, to Rmb575bn, by the end of last week. Banks were themselves among the worst fallers on Tuesday with the financial sector off 7.6 per cent while energy shares dropped 7.4 per cent.”  The 7/11 WSJ reported that “China's banking regulator imposed fresh requirements on banks to keep their wealth-management product business in check, in another step to tighten its grip on a once-loosely regulated part of the shadow-banking business.” Banks must separate their wealth-management product business from retail lending business by setting up separate accounting, statistical analysis, risk management and performance appraisal systems...” Banks had until the end of September to complete the setup of the independent wealth-management departments.  Wealth-management products have been popular because they offer higher yields than deposits. But they are obviously risky. The WSJ reported that over 400 banks had a total of 13.97 trillion yuan ($2.25 trillion) in outstanding wealth-management products at the end of May.  The more fundamental problem in China is that the economy may be slowing faster than widely recognized. Last Wednesday, I reviewed the country’s imports data through October. November data were released on Monday showing that imports remain flat this year, using the 12-month moving average. That’s mirrored in China’s imports from Australia, Brazil, Japan, Taiwan, and the US. Only imports from the European Union and South Korea remain on uptrends, though they started to look toppy in November. Today's Morning Briefing: Downsides In 2015. (1) From the upbeat scenario to the downbeat risks.

Watching oil prices fall as impressively as they have over the past six months, it wouldn’t be unreasonable to predict a challenging road ahead for the U.S. oil and gas industry. Some American producers are facing particularly difficult straits, as falling crude prices threaten the financial viability of shale production, given the capital-intensive nature of hydraulic fracturing. And there seems to be little hope for a quick rebound in oil prices: after OPEC’s decision late last month to maintain current output targets, Credit Suisse cut its first-quarter forecast for Brent to $68 per barrel from $87 in October. The Dow Jones U.S. Oil &amp; Gas Index fell 7 percent the day after the OPEC announcement, for an overall 23 percent decline since June. So oil stocks may not be flashing too many “buy” signals at the moment. But there are diamonds in the rough. Consider those companies with balanced asset portfolios that include refineries, which benefit from lower feedstock costs and therefore help to offset declining revenue on the production side. The stocks of European majors are also trading more cheaply than their U.S. counterparts of late, says Credit Suisse analyst Edward Westlake, making them worth a closer look. There’s also the matter of timing. Falling oil prices notwithstanding, U.S. majors ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips are both about to see improvement, rather than deterioration, in their financial results. That’s because both are winding down the major capital expenditure phase in a handful of very large projects. ExxonMobil’s 2014 capital expenditures, for instance, are on target to come in at $37 billion, down from $42.5 billion in 2013, as the company reaches the end of its planned investment in a $19 billion LNG project in Papua New Guinea. ConocoPhillips’ capital expenditures are also due to taper off next year as it decreases investment in its Surmont oil sands project in Canada and an LNG project in Queensland, Australia. “The majors are entering a period of improved cash generation because of the timing of these mega projects,” says Westlake. Big Oil also has experience on its side. After all, it’s not the first time that major oil companies are grappling with volatile prices. Barely over a decade ago, a combination of increased OPEC supply and reduced demand sparked by the Asian financial crisis sent oil plummeting to below $20 per barrel in the late 1990s. Companies couldn’t do anything about crude prices, so they controlled what they could: their own expenses. In response, U.S. majors invested in productivity-enhancing technology and also reduced their staff. Westlake expects a similar focus on rooting out inefficiencies this time around. Majors also know how to keep their eye on the future. While oil markets are currently imbalanced in part due to the strong growth in U.S. shale, the world will need the oil and gas from shale to meet rising longer-term demand. In other words, the smart money isn’t fleeing oil stocks en masse at the moment but rather positioning itself properly within the industry. Could there be further downside? Of course. But as Lord Rothschild famously said, it’s better to buy when there’s blood in the streets. Much of the oil and gas industry is struggling right now. But those that survive the current downturn could emerge stronger than ever. FREE AppDownload
Central bank and economic divergence have been the underlying themes in my recent writings, and these are having, and will continue to have, significant influence on financial market direction. Going into 2015, how does that impact your investments, and where should you focus your attention? This is the focus of BlackRock’s 2015 Market Outlook, released today. First, some background. These last few post-crisis years could be called the Age of Recovery: The Federal Reserve and other central banks have kept interest rates extraordinarily low to try to revive their economies. In doing so, they’ve helped stocks, but the low rates have made it much more difficult for investors in need of income. In addition, a period of unusually low rates has had the predictable effect of pushing up valuations in several asset classes as investors stretch for yield. Now we are entering what we at BlackRock are calling the Age of Divergence: The U.S., U.K. and select emerging markets are getting stronger while other regions—including much of Europe—are still struggling. The result is that central banks are beginning to take different paths, with the Fed setting a course for higher interest rates and the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan doing the opposite. What does this mean for you and your investment portfolio in the New Year? One of the consequences of the diverging central bank actions is that it should lead to a stronger dollar. That has implications for the markets, such as downward pressure on both commodities and inflation. With equities, it is hard to find bargains, but we believe stocks are still the best place to be. But you’ll have to be even pickier about the stocks you select and consider expanding your investment horizons beyond the U.S. We prefer U.S. cyclical stocks, Japanese equities, and emerging markets in Asia, but are keeping an eye out for opportunities in Europe, where the looser monetary policy could help stocks, particularly cyclical companies. As for fixed income, we would still tread lightly in the bond market. Short-term bonds will bear the brunt of a Fed rate hike. Indeed, as a write in in my weekly commentary, this is already starting to happen; the yield on the two-year U.S. Treasury rose last week to over 0.65%, the highest level since the spring of 2011. Longer-term rates, on the other hand, should inch up at a gentler pace and are likely to remain low relative to their history. But all of this means finding a steady income stream will continue to be a challenge. This is the world as my BlackRock colleagues and I see it. Of course, as is always the case in financial markets, uncertainty is one of the few certainties. In particular, we believe that most of the geopolitical trouble spots throughout the world are ‘frozen conflicts’; few are likely to be reconciled over the next year. Here at home, the big risk would be a quicker tightening campaign by the Fed that takes investors by surprise. Overall, however, investors should avoid the temptation to cash out all their gains. Stocks may not march upward in a straight line, but we believe they should continue to do relatively well in 2015—and better than bonds and cash. FREE AppDownload
It was, for decades, almost an economic truism: whatever direction the unemployment rate took, wage growth went in the other.  When unemployment rose, wage growth stalled. When unemployment fell, wage growth picked up again.  Until recently.  The U.S. economy grew an impressive 3.9 percent last quarter and 4.6 percent in the previous period, and unemployment is the lowest it’s been in six years. Yet wage growth has been paltry: average hourly earnings grew just 2.1 percent in November, barely above the October inflation rate of 1.7 percent—and significantly lower than pre-recession rates that regularly topped 3 percent. This doesn’t bode well for the strength or duration of the recovery: consumers need to earn more if they’re going to spend more. Is our economy broken? Not necessarily, say Credit Suisse analysts Neville Hill and James Sweeney. For one, wage growth does tend to lag economic growth, and the length of the current lag isn’t that unusual for a post-recession environment. And in this recovery, fewer workers have been changing jobs than in the past, so most companies are hiring from the pool of the unemployed, and the result has been little upward pressure on overall wages. Companies won’t need to start hiring from their competitors until demand starts to trump supply. That’s what will cause real growth in wages again.  The good news? There are indications that we’re headed in that direction. Wages rose 0.4 percent in November compared with the previous month, greater than the meager 0.1 percent monthly increase in October. Wages and salaries also rose 0.8 percent in the third quarter, the biggest increase since 2008, according to the Labor Department’s Employment Cost Index. Also, the Fed said in its “Beige Book” report released on Wednesday that wage pressures were picking up, with employers “adjusting compensation to win well-qualified job candidates,” giving raises “to high-value, long-term existing employees,” and increasing wages for lower-skilled jobs. There is, however, the fact that some of the causes of sluggish wage growth aren’t just cyclical, but structural as well. Inflation-adjusted median household income, for example, was on a constant upswing in the final decades of last century, increasing from $42,934 in 1967 to $55,987 in the year 2000. But that was the peak: wages have been in decline ever since, with median income clocking in at $51,939 in 2013. Wages and salaries have also fallen as a share of gross domestic income, from 51.5 percent in 1970 to 42 percent last year, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. “There is an overarching downward trend in what workers get as a percentage of what’s being produced in the country,” says Dana Saporta, U.S. economics analyst at Credit Suisse. One reason for that falling share is that technological advances have allowed companies to replace workers with machines. And machines don’t earn a salary. Another: the continued outsourcing of jobs to countries where labor is cheaper. “The decline in real unit labor costs may partly reflect secular factors that predate the recession,” Fed Chair Janet Yellen said in an August speech. “If so, productivity growth could continue to outpace real wage gains even when the economy is again operating at its potential." Another factor might be the growing corporate emphasis on stock buybacks and dividend payouts, according to University of Massachusetts Lowell economics professor William Lazonick. Between 2003 and 2012, S&amp;P500 companies used 54 percent of earnings to buy back their own stock and 37 percent for dividends. That left just 9 percent for everything else, from investing in the business to employee raises. In other words, the real beneficiaries of corporate capital allocation of late have been stockholders, not low-level employees. “Stock-based instruments make up the majority of [executives’] pay, and in the short term buybacks drive up stock prices,” Lazonick wrote in September in the Harvard Business Review. The structural nature of the wage conundrum may become blurred in the next few months, according to Credit Suisse. Wage growth is expected to start accelerating, which, among other things, could give the Fed reason to start raising interest rates next year. But that will be a cyclical development. Credit Suisse still expects the labor share of national income to remain below pre-2000 levels, and that might be proof that the historic linkage between the economy and wage growth might have been permanently altered. “We expect it to turn around somewhat,” Saporta says, “but the downward trend that has been in place is likely to continue.” FREE AppDownload
TIMEThe Ebola fighters were chosen from a list that included Vladimir Putin and Tim Cook. TIME has announced its Person of the Year for 2014. The magazine awarded the coveted title to people fighting the deadly Ebola virus. From the cover story: 2014 is the year an outbreak turned into an epidemic, powered by the very progress that has paved roads and raised cities and lifted millions out of poverty. This time it reached crowded slums in Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone; it traveled to Nigeria and Mali, to Spain, Germany, and the US. It struck doctors and nurses in unprecedented numbers, wiping out a public-health infrastructure that was weak in the first place. One August day in Liberia, six pregnant women lost their babies when hospitals couldn’t admit them for complications. Anyone willing to treat Ebola victims ran the risk of becoming one. Doctors and healthcare workers have risked their lives to care for those stricken with a virus that has killed more than 6,000 people this year. The outbreak has been confined mostly to three countries in West Africa — Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia — and healthcare workers have faced a stigma from others who fear them because they've been so close to the disease. Ebola symptoms include fever, internal and external bleeding, and organ failure. It's also easily transmittable to those who don't take great precautions to avoid coming into contact with an infected person's bodily fluids. Another look: TIME TIME interviewed Ebola fighters including several doctors, nurses, caregivers, scientists, ambulance drivers, leaders of organizations , and many others. Here's what a few of them had to say.Centers for Disease Control Director Dr. Tom Frieden: “When the cases first hit, we sent in a team, and our team felt that they could control it. But there was some friction with [World Health Organization], which I had to get involved in. Essentially, people thought it was going to be controlled, and they didn’t want us there. So I had to tell WHO, ‘Let our team in, this is ridiculous.’ They wanted to do it themselves. There was resentment. They didn’t want to feel like they were dependent on the CDC. We left, and then Ebola came roaring back.”Medecins Sans Frontieres President Joanne Liu: “I remember very well the WHO saying the outbreak was under control, and it took us awhile to convince them that it was not. The wake-up call came when volunteers from Samaritan’s Purse were infected in late July. Suddenly, Ebola wasn’t such a distant reality for the Western world.”Nurse Amber Vinson: “It was hard to see a lot of the things they were saying in the news. It was emotionally taxing. The media was disappointing in some ways, because it promotes fear.”Nurse Nina Pham: “I replay it over and over again in my head how I could have gotten infected. I did everything that was recommended. It was just a shock when my chief nursing officer and a CDC officer came to see me in their full protective equipment. I knew it was not good.”Caregiver Salome Karwah: “I was in the treatment center for four weeks [and] four days. Really, what made me survive is the support from the nurses. The support from the psychosocial [team] also really helped me…. They were looking for survivors to come and work [at the MSF clinic]. I make it my duty to come. The more I interact with people, the more I will forget about my sad story. The more I share my story with people, the more I will get strong, strong, strong and stronger.”Dr. Jerry Brown: “When it all started and we had a treatment unit set up, my wife did warn me not to enter the unit. So I didn’t tell her. I had been in the unit two weeks without her knowing…. A few days later she noticed changes in the color of my boxers from the chlorine solution used for disinfection when leaving the unit. She said, ‘Ah, what is this?’ I had no option but to confess. We talked about it for some time, and then she accepted it. What she said was, ‘I can’t stop you. I realize this is something you like, so I am not going to stop you. But just be careful.’”Emory University Hospital’s Dr. Bruce Ribner: “Early on in the outbreak, I knew there were people in Africa who had Ebola, and I knew there were Americans there. I also knew that if they were transferred back to the US, there was a high likelihood that they would look at us. Our primary mission is to support CDC workers. But I was not thinking about a civilian until I got that phone call [about Dr. Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol].”Dr. Kent Brantly: “Shortly after I arrived at Emory, [my wife] Amber called from a phone outside my room. I don’t remember that conversation, I was so delirious, but she said to me, “We watched you walk off that ambulance.” I said, ‘You were watching me?’ And she said, ‘Oh, Kent. The whole world was watching you.’”Public-health educator Ella Watson-Stryker: “Guinea broke my heart. I was not prepared for the level of mortality. I wasn’t prepared to watch entire families die. I wasn’t prepared to watch entire villages die.”Nurse Kaci Hickox: "I have witnessed the devastation Ebola causes and have personally experienced the stigma that fear of this disease brings. I do want to go back to West Africa, but for now, I’m taking things day by day."Ambulance supervisor Foday Gallah: “I am going to get on that ambulance. I am going to every nook and cranny of the capital city, pick up whatsoever Ebola patient and take them to the treatment unit, and give them words of hope, of encouragement. And try to educate people about Ebola.”      FREE AppDownload

Good morning! Here what you need for know for Wednesday.  Demand For OPEC's Oil Sinks To A 12-Year Low. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries lowered its projection for oil demand in 2015 to 28.9 million barrels a day, its lowest level since 2002. "The downward revision reflects the upward adjustment of non-OPEC supply as well as the downward revision in global demand," OPEC said in its monthly market report. Oil Sinks Again. Oil prices continue to drop amid fears of a supply glut and weakening demand. US WTI crude futures fell to as low as $62.25 a barrel, and Brent crude slipped to $65.29 a barrel, which is just above the five-year low hit Tuesday. China's Inflation Slowed To A 5-Year-Low. The consumer price index rose 1.4% in November, below analyst expectations of 1.6%, and a sign of "persistent weakness in the world's second-largest economy," Reuters said. French Industrial Production Slumped. Industrial production fell 0.8% between September and October. Manufacturing output fell 0.2% after a 0.3% gain in September. US Mortgage Applications Are Up. Mortgage applications jumped 7.3% during the week ending Friday. This partially reverses the prior week's 7.3% decline. Markets Are Mixed. Europe is mostly higher after Tuesday's drubbing. Britain's FTSE is up 0.1%, France's CAC 40 is up 0.4%, and Germany's DAX is up 0.8%. Japan's Nikkei closed down 2.2%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng closed up 0.1%. US futures are flat. No Major US Data. No major market-moving economic reports are scheduled for release Wednesday. UK's Trade Deficit Sinks. The UK’s deficit on trade in goods and services is estimated to have fallen to £2.0 billion in October, compared with £2.8 billion in September. This reflects a deficit of £9.6 billion on goods, partly offset by an estimated surplus of £7.6 billion on services. The fall in the trade of goods deficit reflects a sharper fall in imports rather than a rise in exports. US Extends Scrutiny Of Standard Chartered. The British bank will face three more years of "enhanced oversight," Reuters writes, over the bank's alleged violations related to US sanctions on Iran and other countries. Oil God Is Out. Oil-trading "god" Andrew John Hall is leaving Phibro, a commodities-trading unit Occidental Petroleum purchased from Citigroup in 2009, Bloomberg News reports.

Thomson ReutersA completed house is seen behind the earthworks of a home currently under construction in BrandywineNEW YORK, (Reuters) - Applications for U.S. home mortgages rose last week as both purchase and refinancing applications increased, an industry group said on Wednesday. The Mortgage Bankers Association said its seasonally adjusted index of mortgage application activity, which includes both refinancing and home purchase demand, rose 7.3 percent in the week ended Dec. 5. The MBA's seasonally adjusted index of refinancing applications rose 13.2 percent, while the gauge of loan requests for home purchases, a leading indicator of home sales, rose 1.3 percent. Fixed 30-year mortgage rates averaged 4.11 percent in the week, up 3 basis points from 4.08 percent the week before.

REUTERS/Heinz-Peter Bader Saudi oil minister Ali Al-Naimi. The cut of about 300,000 barrels a day in expected demand comes after crude oil prices have collapsed by 40% since June. "The downward revision reflects the upward adjustment of non-OPEC supply as well as the downward revision in global demand," OPEC said in its monthly market report. The combination of slowing growth, particularly in energy-intensive countries like China, and the shale oil boom in the US has put significant pressure on oil prices over recent months. Brent crude has fallen to under $66 a barrel from a peak of $115 in June, while US benchmark WTI crude is down to $62.7 a barrel from over $107. EIABrent vs WTI crude prices in 2014. Last month OPEC decided against cutting production despite the price falls. In the statement following its decision the cartel said "although world oil demand is forecast to increase during the year 2015, this will, yet again, be offset by the projected increase of 1.36 mb/d in non-OPEC supply." What did it mean by that? Well in recent years non-OPEC supply has been increasing, meaning that OPEC's hold over global oil markets has been weakened. This means the cartel, which controls about 40% of global oil production, is having to compete much more actively on price with non-OPEC producers to maintain market share. Here's OPEC's killer chart: OPECGlobal oil demand vs non-OPEC supply. As a demonstration of this trend, output from within OPEC actually fell by 390,000 barrels a day in November because of supply disruption in Libya, after rebels seized the country's critical Sharara oil field. However, those falls were more than compensated for by increases in non-OPEC supply which has risen by 1.72 million barrels a day in 2014, about 580,000 a day more than OPEC's initial estimates, according to Bloomberg. This has left some analysts to speculate that for now OPEC is simply unable to halt further oil price slides. Bank of America's Francisco Blanch said the organization was "effectively dissolved" after failing to cut production at its latest meeting over the protests of many of its members.   FREE AppDownload

 The Ukraine economy is on the brink of collapse after the International Monetary Fund identified a $15 billion shortfall in government funding that will need to be plugged "within weeks," according to the Financial Times. The shortfall comes after Ukraine's gross domestic product fell by 5.3% in the third quarter of 2014, the State Statistics Service reported Wednesday, as the country lurches from crisis to crisis. Ukraine's GDP also dropped 4.7% in the second quarter and saw a 1.1% contraction in Q1. In short, the country is in deep trouble. Analysts are predicting a total contraction of about 7% through 2014, and the country looks set to continue its decline next year. This sharp contraction comes at an unfortunate time for the country, just before it is set to hand over $19 billion over the next three years ($7.5 billion in 2015, $4.7 billion in 2016, and $6.6 billion in 2017) in debt payments. Bank of America Merrill LynchUkraine government payment schedule. Under IMF rules, the fund is not allowed to provide capital to a donor country, even if it has already been pledged, unless it is confident that the country can meet its financing obligations for the next 12 months. This means the bailout is on hold until donors sign off on the increase in funding — but the desire for such a large increase is sorely lacking. In fact the country's recovery could still be years away, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. "In the scenario of stabilization, the recovery is likely to start only in 2017 and we project growth to be around 3-4% in 2017-19, close to its potential level. In this scenario, the debt-to-GDP ratio would rise further but would stabilize below 90% in 2017-19E, if fiscal consolidation reforms continue and UAH devaluation slows." That is, assuming that the ongoing conflict with pro-Russian rebels in the east of the country doesn't intensify and that the fragile new government is able not only to announce but also to implement thorough economic reforms and clamp down on corruption, then the economy might — just might — start to grow again at a modest pace in 2017. This is a world away from the optimistic scenarios for Ukraine that supporters of the Maidan protests in Kiev envisaged at the start of the year. Bank of America Merrill LynchUkraine debt-to-GDP. These forecasts now look wildly optimistic. The government in Kiev has effectively lost control of regions accounting for some 16% of Ukraine GDP to rebels, while the costs of fighting continue to mount. And now the country is running out of money. In response, Ukraine's central bank has been forced to burn through its foreign-currency reserves to meet government spending commitments as the economy struggles. Last week it announced that reserves had fallen below $10 billion, its lowest point in a decade, according to The Wall Street Journal. The situation is now hitting crisis point. Finance ministry officials from G-7 countries met last week to decide upon a new $4 billion loan package for Kiev, but doubts linger over the ability of the new government, which took office only last week following elections in October, to deliver on its commitments. Any new money is likely to be made conditional on the swift passing of a new budget due Dec. 20 that is likely to require significant spending cuts. Such is the scale of the problem that European Union ministers were reported to be considering petitioning Russia to roll over its $3 billion loan to Ukraine, despite EU sanctions against the country over its role in supporting the rebels. One possibility being floated is that Ukraine be allowed to begin negotiations to restructure its debts (that is, seek forgiveness of some of the debt) coupled with any new injection of funds. That way the debt sustainability question that is a potential huge stumbling block to the IMF program would at least be resolved, even if it comes at a cost to those holding Ukraine government debt. So far there has been predictably strong resistance among bondholders to this idea, but they may be on the wrong side of the argument. After all, getting some money back from Ukraine in an organized manner is better than getting nothing in the case of a sovereign default.   FREE AppDownload
This has not been a good week for Greek stocks. After Tuesday's absolute demolition, with the Athens Stock Exchange plunging 12.78% (worse than any day during the euro crisis), shares are tanking again.  The ASE is down 7.58% at 2.30 p.m. GMT, with Greece's banks once again leading the decline. National Bank of Greece is down by about 25% this week, with similar sell-offs for Piraeus Bank and Alpha Bank. Here's what the Athens Stock Exchange looks like this week: Investing.com, Business Insider Thursday, it's off the back of a speech by Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras. He's promising debt restructuring if his coalition stays in power, and markets aren't liking it. He also used the G-word, "Grexit," which terrified markets so much during the euro crisis. Samaras says Syriza, the radical left-wing group that wants to tear up Greece's bailout arrangements, is threatening the country's eurozone membership.  If Samaras can't find the votes he needs from Greek legislators in presidential elections on Dec. 17, and again later in the month, there will be parliamentary elections, which Syriza is expected to win.  At least one party, the Democratic Left, is refusing to budget and support Samaras' efforts to install a president. According to MacroPolis, the Democratic Left's 10 legislators unanimously agreed not to vote with the government. The government has 155 of Greece's 300 parliamentarians, and it needs 180 to approve Stavros Dimas, the government's candidate. Greece's government bond yields are reacting, too: Yields on the government's 10-year bonds are back above 9%, the highest in 2014 so far, barring a very brief spike in October. Bond yields are a common measurement of how risky it is to hold a government's debt. Admittedly, that's still pretty low by Greek standards: Investing.com   FREE AppDownload
BEIJING (Reuters) - The former deputy head of China's top planning agency was jailed for life on Wednesday over a bribery scandal that exposed graft at the highest levels of China's government, and ensnared several companies including Toyota Motor Corp. The sentence, handed down by a court just outside of Beijing, capped the downfall of Liu Tienan, who was sacked as deputy head of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) last year, a position that carries ministerial-level status. Liu was the first ministerial-level official to face an investigation after Xi Jinping became Communist Party head in late 2012 and launched the most aggressive anti-graft campaign China has seen in decades. Xi has pledged to take down high-ranking "tigers" and low-ranking "flies" in his fight against a pervasive problem he says could threaten the Chinese Communist Party's rule. Although the number of officials investigated for corruption has increased, the government's campaign has not targeted high-level "princelings", the privileged children of the revolutionary founders of the People's Republic of China. Analysts are divided on the motivations of Xi's campaign. Some say the drive is seen as a tool to remove Xi's opponents, while others say that it is necessary to weed out people standing in the way of his implementation of economic reforms. "Corruption is the biggest hindrance to China's reforms," said Zhuang Deshui, the deputy director of the Clean Government Center at Peking University. "In reality, the anti-corruption campaign is the fight against interest groups and to change the present distribution system of power."  Liu's trial has offered a rare glimpse into the amount of power amassed by top officials, especially within the NDRC. The agency sets policy for strategic industries, approves big investments, mergers and acquisitions, and has the authority to influence prices for everything from liquor to gasoline. The presiding judge in the court of Langfang city in Hebei province said Liu had "violated the integrity of the duties of the nation's workers". Prosecutors had charged Liu and his son, Liu Decheng, with taking 35.6 million yuan ($5.74 million) in bribes in dealings with various companies. China's crackdown on graft has extended to large companies such as drugmakers, airlines and makers of medical devices. Liu, 60, pleaded guilty to extensive bribery involving several companies including a Toyota joint venture in September. The Supreme People's Procuratorate did not respond for comment on whether the companies were being investigated. The firms could not be reached for comment. State television showed Liu breaking down into tears. He said he has been in "a state of painful remorse" during the past 10 months of investigation. "Every inquiry and every word has, in fact, been like a whip beating my soul," he said. At least two other officials at the NDRC have also been swept up in the probe into the agency including Cao Changqing, who recently retired as head of the pricing division at the NDRC, and Zhang Dongsheng, who was the head of the employment and income distribution division at the agency. The government has also launched a series of probes into the energy sector that has brought down senior officials in the National Energy Administration and state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation. Zhou Yongkang, the most senior leader targeted in a corruption probe since the party took power in 1949, had built a vast network of friends and allies in the energy sector over several decades. Last Saturday, authorities said they had arrested Zhou and expelled him from the party. In a front-page article on Tuesday, the official People's Court newspaper said "the entire (Supreme People's) Court and the police agree to firmly support the central government's decision into the handling of the Zhou Yongkangcase".

 Mastercard has enlisted the help of The Voice judge and No Doubt singer Gwen Stefani to front a new campaign that will see the credit card company reward customers for using Apple Pay, Adweek reports. Stefani fronts a 30-second TV ad (watch it below,) created by McCann XBC, which sees her standing at the top of a tall building behind a cannon, firing gifts like handbags and concert tickets at MasterCard holders who use Apple Pay. The campaign extends into the real world, with MasterCard offering some lucky Apple Pay users prizes such as a meet-and-greet with Stefani and World Series tickets. It forms the next chapter in MasterCard's long-running "Priceless Surprises" series. (Stefani, of course, once did a series of ads for HTC's Windows Phones but seems to have defected to Apple.) The campaign comes at a key time for Apple Pay. While there has been a huge wave of PR surrounding the launch of Apple Pay, which allows users to pay for items in-store by using their iPhones, Apple has not supported the payments system with much paid-for advertising. As a result, not many iPhone users have used Apple Pay, and some don't even know it's there. Only 4.6% of iPhone 6 users transacted with Apple Pay on Black Friday, one of the busiest shopping days of the year, according to a survey conducted by InfoScout. Overall, just 9% of iPhone 6 users have ever used Apple Pay since it launched on October 20. Why did Apple Pay underperform? The two largest drivers were that 31% of consumers did not realize Apple Pay was accepted within the store, and 21% simply forgot to use it. BI Intelligence/InfoScout An education push on Apple Pay is clearly needed, which this MasterCard campaign — with its added incentives of prizes — will go some way toward doing. FREE AppDownload

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said on Wednesday that Western sanctions over Ukraine were harmful for the Russian economy, but that Western economies were also affected. "(Sanctions) damage the economies and companies of the countries imposing sanctions just as much as (they damage ours)," he said in an interview with Russian media. Western powers have introduced economic sanctions against Russia over its actions in Ukraine, ranging from asset freezes to bans on access to foreign capital by Russian companies. Moscow banned certain food imports from the European Union in response. (Reporting By Alexei Anishchuk, editing by John Stonestreet) FREE AppDownload
LONDON (Reuters) - Oil major BP said on Wednesday it would spend $1 billion on group-wide restructuring in the coming year as it laid out its long-term plans for its upstream oil and gas business. The British company said as part of its program to simplify across its upstream and downstream activities and corporate functions, it expected to incur the charges over the next five quarters, including the current quarter. In light of the current outlook for oil prices, BP said it would also review its capital expenditure plans for 2015. The group said in a statement it had a strong balance sheet, with historically low gearing of 15 percent at the end of the third quarter of 2014, which provided time and flexibility to adjust to changes in the environment, including the oil price.

© AFP/File Frederick FlorinMembers of the European Parliament protest against tax havens on November 27, 2014, in StrasbourgLondon (AFP) - Dozens of companies including Microsoft, Disney and Koch Industries were dragged into the Luxembourg tax avoidance "LuxLeaks" scandal with the release of new documents by investigative journalists. The revelations increase pressure on former prime minister Jean-Claude Juncker over Luxembourg's tax policies during his 19 years in office, and come on the eve of his swearing-in as president of the European Commission. The new claims emerge from 28,000 pages of documents obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), and examined by dozens of newspapers. The first installment in November revealed hundreds of the world's biggest companies brokered secret deals with Luxembourg to avoid paying billions of dollars in taxes. The new documents detail "aggressive tax structures" brokered for major companies by accountants Ernst &amp; Young, KPMG, PwC and Deloitte between 2003 and 2011, when Juncker was in office. They contain confidential "tax rulings" from Luxembourg officials that "assure companies they will get favourable treatment for their tax-saving manoeuvres", according to the ICIJ. The reports claim internet calling business Skype, owned by Microsoft, used an Irish subsidiary to allow its Luxembourg unit to report no corporation tax over five years. Meanwhile, entertainment giant the Walt Disney Company and Koch Industries had complex arrangements to channel "hundreds of millions of dollars in profits through Luxembourg" from 2009 to 2013 and pay little tax, the ICIJ said. Canadian aerospace giant Bombardier and communications firm Telecom Italia are also named in the documents, according to Belgian newspaper Le Soir, which reported that Disney was afforded a 0.28 percent tax rate in the arrangements. British newspaper The Guardian reported the documents name major consumer goods company Reckitt Benckiser and Lycra company Invista, owned by the powerful US conservative political donors the Koch brothers. The scandal has increased political pressure to address tax avoidance, and on Tuesday investigative journalists called on Juncker to make company ownership transparent. "The 'LuxLeaks' scandal is a recent example of the kind of corrosive deals that big companies are able to extract from countries when they think no one will see," the dozens of international journalists wrote in the open letter. REUTERS/Francois LenoirLuxembourg's Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker talks to the media as he arrives at a European Union leaders summit in Brussels May 22, 2013.  The November leaks, which named companies including Apple, Pepsi, IKEA and Heinz as tax breaks beneficiaries while Juncker was prime minister, hit less than a week after he took office at the head of the European Commission. "Subjectively speaking, I have no more to answer for than others," Juncker said in an interview published on Wednesday in the French daily Liberation. "But objectively speaking, I was weakened because 'LuxLeaks' suggests I was party to manoeuvres that do not meet the basic standards of ethics and morality."  Juncker conceded in November that while he was "not the architect" of the problem, he was "politically responsible" for Luxembourg's tax practices as prime minister. The European Commission has fought back on the issue, announcing agreements on Tuesday to close loopholes and to ensure the exchange of tax information between the EU's 28 member states. "Current events require us to step up our efforts against corporate tax avoidance and aggressive tax planning on all fronts," said Pierre Moscovici, European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs, Taxation and Customs. Since June, the commission has also launched investigations into the tax affairs of Amazon and Fiat in Luxembourg, Apple in Ireland and Starbucks in the Netherlands to determine whether sweetheart tax deals could constitute illegal state aid.

Brent crude remained above $66 barrel on Wednesday, after resuming its drift downward amid a glut of oil on the market, following a short-lived reprieve the previous day when a weaker dollar had provided some support to prices. Worries about oversupply have pushed Brent down 40% since June. "Notwithstanding day-to-day movements, the fundamental picture hasn't really changed, and that is one of supply outstripping demand growth for most of the year," said Phin Ziebell, a senior analyst at National Australia Bank. "It's an incessant march downwards, and it would be interesting to see where it bottoms out, but there doesn't seem to be any sign of it so far." On Wednesday, Brent's front-month futures contract traded down 71 cents at $66.13 a barrel by 7:25 GMT (2:25 a.m. ET), after falling more than a dollar to $65.78, still above a five-year low of $65.29 touched Tuesday. On Monday alone it fell $2.88, or 4.2%, its third-largest one-day loss this year. US crude futures fell $1 to $62.82 a barrel at one point before picking up slightly to $63.08, down 74 cents on the day. These West Texas Intermediate futures also closed higher Tuesday after a fall of $2.79, or 4.2%, on Monday. US inventories rose 4.4 million barrels in the past week to 377.4 million barrels, compared with analysts' expectations of a drop of 2.2 million, according to the American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday. The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) has trimmed its forecast for domestic oil production growth for 2015 by about 100,000 barrels per day, a sign of the potential impact of lower prices and weaker-than-expected global demand growth. "In the midst of oversupply, we also look forward to see how US crude field production is affected by falling oil prices. This would be more crucial in seeing how inventories would be like moving into 2015," said Daniel Ang of Phillip Futures in a note. Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries are divided on how to respond to the global surplus and falling prices. The cartel may still hold an emergency meeting before its June gathering, Algeria's energy minister said Tuesday. Top oil producer Saudi Arabia blocked production cuts at the last meeting in November and has taken steps to shore up its market share.

PARIS (AP) — Creating jobs in France is proving harder than expected. The embattled Socialist-led government is making its second push this year to energize the labor market in Europe's second-largest economy, after a top economic official called the previous plan "a failure." Although President Francois Hollande has made cutting unemployment the cornerstone of his tenure, the jobs market is in fact getting worse. Unemployment climbed to 10.4 percent in the third quarter from 10.1 percent in the previous three months despite a package of payroll tax cuts for businesses earlier this year that was meant to encourage hiring. Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron will on Wednesday present a new bundle of policies — a "growth and activity" bill. It has sharply divided Hollande's own Socialist Party but drawn praise from France's powerful business lobby, Medef, which argues that previous efforts did not go far enough. Macron is a former Rothschild investment banker who Hollande chose to replace Socialist firebrand Arnaud Montebourg last August. Four months into the job, Macron has been thrust onto the front lines of France's effort to create jobs — and save Hollande's. "Macron's Law," as the bill has been dubbed, is a grab bag of measures aimed at boosting employment by freeing up some of France's notoriously inflexible labor rules and regulations. The measures include relaxing rules on stores' Sunday and evening opening hours; removing some restrictions on new bus lines to increase competition with national rail operator SNCF; and opening up regulated professions such as notaries and auctioneers to greater competition. The bill also calls for reforming France's complex system of labor relations boards and from five to six billion euros worth of sales from the French state's 76 billion-euro ($94 billion) holdings of corporate assets. The French parliament will only begin debating the bill next month, but it's already sparked controversy, with opponents planning to demonstrate against it when it is presented at the weekly cabinet meeting Wednesday. Owning up to his failure to meet a pledge to start cutting unemployment by 2013, Hollande said last month that if he still hasn't succeeded in the next two years, he won't run for re-election in 2017. The European Union, which has put France under surveillance along with a number of other countries for exceeding agreed limits to its deficit, forecasts France's unemployment rate to remain above 10 percent at least until 2016. Hollande has blamed a lack of economic growth for unemployment's continued rise this year — unemployment was 9. 7 percent when he came into office in 2012, and has been rising since early 2008. French economic growth is only forecast to be 0.4 percent this year, and 1 percent in 2015. Macron himself said the government's last big effort to relaunch the economy, the so-called Responsibility Pact, was a failure. The pact announced by Hollande in January aims to ease payroll taxes by up to 40 billion euros ($50 billion) by 2017. In exchange, companies were expected to hire. Business owners, however, argue the government's efforts don't go far enough to reduce labor costs, and earlier this month thousands of business owners protested in the streets of Paris and Toulouse against taxes and regulations. Business owners are not the only ones dissatisfied with the economy's handling. A survey published by French business daily Les Echos on Monday showed nine out of 10 French people disapprove of the government's economic policy. ___ Follow Greg Keller on Twitter at https://twitter.com/Greg_Keller Copyright (2014) Associated Press.
