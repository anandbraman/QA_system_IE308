And with inflation falling and the dollar stronger, analysts across Wall Street are convinced the yellow metal will continue to lose its luster. Unfortunately, this has been devastating for the gold bulls, especially those who expected easy monetary policy to send prices into the stratosphere. While gold prices were on their ascent, we heard some bullish calls from high-profile Wall Streeters that would make dotcom era equity analysts blush. For whatever reason, gold ultra-bulls argued that the precious metal would be worth multiples of where it is today.  We've heard targets from $5,000 to $46,000. With prices plummeting again (currently around $1,282/oz), we thought it would be a good time to revisit some of the wildest gold price targets we've heard in the last year.

(Reuters) - Prospective borrowers ranging from U.S. companies to county governments on Monday shelved a raft of deals to raise new capital or refinance debt as a suddenly uncertain interest rate environment dented demand. In the municipal bond market, half a dozen deals aimed at raising collectively more than $300 million were postponed, while several companies pulled plans to refinance syndicated bank loans. Corporate bonds, meanwhile, passed a fourth day with no deals brought to market, either in the risky high-yield sector or the safer investment-grade sphere. Raising capital has been challenging to say the least since last Wednesday when Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke sent interest rates soaring by outlining a plan to wind down the central bank's massive stimulus program. Known as quantitative easing and consisting of $85 billion a month in bond purchases, the program was instrumental in a rally of bonds, equities and commodities, and had driven interest rates to record lows. But since Bernanke's comments last week, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury Note has shot up 37 basis points, briefly touching a two-year high of 2.67 percent on Monday. "We need to have panic selling (in Treasuries) out of the way and a stable level on the 10-year Treasury," before the new-issue market can return, said Scott Schulte, senior investment-grade corporate bond syndicate manager at Citigroup. That needs to be followed by borrowers willing to sell bonds at higher yields than they had to under the Fed's easy-money regime. Corporate bonds had been flying off the shelves until recently as companies looked to refinance at record low rates and yield-hungry investors were ready to sign checks. Since Bernanke first floated the notion last month of a pull back from bond buying, corporate bonds have fallen hard and are now down for the year by 3.74 percent on a total return basis, according to the Barclays investment-grade index. "The level to which investment grade corporate bonds are interest rate sensitive will certainly be an eye-opener to many total return investors when they open up their quarterly statements on June 30," said Edward Marrinan, head of Royal Bank of Scotland's US research. Said CrediCorp Capital CEO Christian Laub: "What we know is that we won't see cheap financing like we did in the early half of the year." MUNI BOND SALES STALL; LOAN REFINANCINGS SHELVED Municipal issues have also slowed to a crawl, with bond sales worth $331 million postponed on Monday. That brought the total value of deals shelved since mid-June to $2.6 billion. A steep price drop in the $3.7 trillion municipal bond market has lifted yields on bonds due in 10 and 30 years to levels not seen since 2011. "Public officials do not want be the ones selling a deal at yields which result to be top of the market," said a municipal bond analyst who declined to be named. "They prefer to wait for the market to calm down and become more stable before pushing ahead with their sales." Loop Capital, a muni bond underwriter, recently cut its estimate for 2013 muni issuance to $360 billion from $400 billion, but Loop Managing Director Chris Mier said they may cut their forecast more if present conditions persist. Still, the two big munis deal of the week remain on the calendar for now: $1.3 billion each from the state of Illinois and the city of Los Angeles. In the syndicated loan market, Loan Pricing Corp, a unit of Thomson Reuters, reported that Beats Electronics, the consumer audio company founded by rapper Dr. Dre, pulled a $600 million to $650 million senior secured loan deal designed to finance a dividend recapitalization. Meanwhile, aircraft part manufacturer PRV Aerospace shelved a proposed repricing due to market conditions, sources told LPC. STOCK ISSUANCE ALSO HURT Equity capital raising is also at risk, bankers said. At least 10 initial public offerings are due to price this week and analysts said some could be postponed, while IPO activity is expected to slow in the coming weeks. Bankers remain hopeful that two of this week's biggest IPOs, a $1.3 billion offering by industrial distribution company HD Supply and a $642 million offering by technology distribution company CDW Corporation, will price. But both deals are not yet covered and are facing some pushback on valuation. "It's a nervous and anxious time this week for IPO investors," said IPO Boutique's managing director Scott Sweet. Last week, specialty retailer Five Below Incpostponed a secondary share offering citing "current capital market conditions." Further south, Azul Linhas AÃ©reas Brasileiras SA, Brazil's third-biggest airline, is considering postponing an IPO scheduled for as early as next month and expected to raise some $450 million because of market conditions. The end of the upcoming quarter, as well as the July 4 U.S. holiday contribute to the expected slowdown, but poor after market performance of recent IPOs such as perfume company Coty Incand in-flight wireless provider Gogo Incare also to blame.

But going forward, the pace of home price gains is expected to slow. Paul Diggle of Capital Economics lists three reasons, which we paraphrase here: With that in mind we will closely be watching two three key housing data points out tomorrow.Â  The FHFA house price index (HPI) and the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller home price index for April are out at 9 a.m. ET. Economists polled by Bloomberg are looking for the HPI to rise 1.1% month-over-month. The 20-city Case Shiller is expected to rise 10.6% year-over-year, and 1.2% MoM.Â  This is followed by new home sales for June at 10 a.m. ET. Economists polled by Bloomberg are looking for new home sales to rise 1.3% MoM to 460,000. For the full year, economists estimate U.S. home prices will rise 8%.
The S&amp;P 500 closed at 1,573 today, which is down over 6% from its recent all-time highs. Many have attributed much of the pullback to the hawkish tone that the Federal Reserve has recently adopted. However, stock market fundamentals have been deteriorating lately too.  Specifically, earnings expectations have come down sharply. And earnings are arguably the most important driver of stocks. In his latest note to clients, Citi's Tobias Levkovich says he is "shocked" by how negative these trends have been. The Street had become a bit too happy of late and then got upended by the Fed and the likely tapering of QE amidst some prior hopes of a delay in ending such accommodative policy, almost without spending any time looking at earnings estimates or trends less than a month before second quarter results are released. Such a thought process seems ill-founded since earnings matter the most for equities, in our opinion, and there is relatively robust statistical evidence to back up that contention. In this respect, we have been a tad shocked by the surge in negative-to-positive preannouncement trends that make 2009’s surge appear less worrisome in retrospect (see Figure 1). Upward earnings guidance has dipped as well (see Figure 2) and there has been little consternation or discussion about it. Citi Research Levkovich may be exaggerating a bit by saying "there has been little consternation or discussion about it."  Indeed, plenty of people have warned about asset prices dislocating from fundamentals. They just couldn't be heard over the deafening stock market rally. Looking forward, Levkovich doesn't think this ugly trend of negative earnings expectations to improve in the near-term. "[W]e suspect some additional estimate cuts may be in the making when company management teams provide more realistic 2H13 outlooks in the latter part of July during earnings related conference calls," he wrote. "While we envision an improving US economic backdrop assisting estimates, we are more concerned about international activity trends, with Europe, China and Brazil potentially generating disappointment, alongside commodity-driven economies that may have been banking on better business activity as well."

Diversifying Among Actively Managed Funds Within An Asset Class Isn't The Smartest Bet (Rick Ferri) "Diversifying actively managed mutual funds within an asset class is a bad thing because it decreases the already low probability for outperforming a comparable portfolio of all index funds," according to Rick Ferri. "If you canâ€™t buy index funds, then pick one active fund per asset class and hope for the best." Ferri and Alex Benke of Betterment looked at thousands of actively managed mutual funds portfolios. They compared the performance of actively managed fund portfolios to that of index fund portfolios with the same asset allocation over the same time frame. In one scenario they look at portfolios holding more than once actively managed fund in three asset classes, U.S. stocks, international assets, and U.S. Investment-grade bonds.Â  "The three-fund index fund portfolio had an 82.9% probability of outperforming the actively managed fund portfolios when only one fund was selected in each of the three asset classes. The odds increased in favor of index funds when two active funds were selected for each of the three asset classes (a total of six funds).Â  When three actively managed funds were selected for each of the three asset classes (a total of nine funds), the odds reached 91.0% in favor of index fund. The study has a margin of error of Â±1.0%." Brian Belski: Putting The Stock Market Rally In Perspective (BMO Capital Markets) "This has been one of the strongest stock market recoveries to date, yet it has also been one of the weakest economic recoveries. For instance, stocks are up about 144% from their March 9, 2009 low, almost double the average of 83% for all other bull markets up to this point in the cycle. In fact, no other post WWII bull market has shown such strong performance 53 months into the bull market (although the mid-1980s bull market was close). "On the other hand, economic data has been disappointing up to this point into the expansion (Exhibit 6). Sooner or later, the macros are going to have to improve sharply in order to justify recent stock gains, in our view. For our part, we continue to believe that the economy will continue to grow at a moderate pace in the coming years â€“ and significantly better than other major and emerging economies on a relative basis. But near term, we think stock prices have gotten a bit too far ahead of themselves."

LONDON (Reuters) - Federal Reserve policymaker Richard Fisher said on Monday he was comfortable with the rise in U.S. Treasury yields following the central bank's signal it planned to slow its support, but cautioned that a big spike would be "destructive". "I'm not uncomfortable with the current rates," Fisher told journalists after speaking at an event organized by OMFIF. "I don't think you can judge it based on a couple of days... we've had this market reaction but we have to wait and see how things settle out." Last week Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke signaled the central bank may start winding down its bond-buying program later this year and end it by the middle of 2014, when unemployment will likely be about 7 percent. His comments sent stocks tumbling and bond yields sharply up, as investors prepared for less stimulus from the Fed despite a less-than-stellar pace of economic recovery. "What personally I would be worried about is a significant spike (in U.S. yields)," Fisher added. "That would show risk of financial instability but a gradual rise over time (would not worry me)." Fisher, who heads the Dallas Federal Reserve, also said the central bank had to follow through with its signal if things panned out roughly as expected with the U.S. economy. "If the big operators detect weakness they will test it. If they pick up a scent of lack of resolve they will test it." "Collectively we will be tested. We need to expect a market reaction," Fisher added. (Reporting by Marc Jones and Francesco Canepa) Copyright (2013) Thomson Reuters. Click for restrictions

REUTERS/Paul Hackett Here's a byline you don't see everyday: Roger Waters, David Gilmour, and Nick Mason. These of course are the remaining members of Pink Floyd (original songwriter and guitarist Syd Barrett died in 2006; keys player Richard Wright in 2008). But the occasion of their "reunion" is not a gig but rather an op-ed published by USA Today about not getting proper compensation, specifically from Internet radio provider Pandora.Â  The company has been sending around a letter to artists whose music it is licensed to play asking for their support for legislation that would equalize royalty rates. Pandora pitches the legislation as a way to support up-and-coming bands by giving them greater exposure on their rapidly growing platform. Â Currently,Â satellite radio pays about 7.5% of its revenues for royalties, while Â cable TV pays about 15%. As a result of the current legislation governing Internet radio, Pandora must pay 50%. But the Floyd are calling B.S.: Of course, thisÂ letterÂ doesn't say anything about an 85% artist pay cut. That would probably turn off most musicians who might consider signing on. All it says about royalties is "We are all fervent advocates for the fair treatment of artists." And the only hint of Pandora's real agenda is the innocent sounding line "We are also fervent supporters of internet radio and want more than anything for it to grow." The petition doesn't mention that Pandora is pushing the growth of its business directly at the expense of artists' paychecks. The band is not exactly in the poorhouse. But indie artists have raised the same issue, arguing that while the figure may represent a lot for Pandora â€” which saw $125.5 million in revenues last quarter Â â€” it ends up being peanuts for most artists given the number of times a given song is played. The band claims it's ready to compromise if Pandora is in the mood to do so, but it seems clear they've recognizedÂ what sort of animal they're dealing with.

You have to hand it to The Onion, their satirical economics coverage has more than a grain of truth to it. The title to this piece is: Markets In Turmoil As Price Of Money Skyrockets To $90 A Dollar. Of course that's silly, but actually, when the price of the currency is surging, that's deflation, which actually is the big concern right now, as gold, commodities, and equities are all tumbling. The fact that central bankers seem to be throwing their hands in the air, not inclined to do anything more to stoke the economy only adds to the deflation concern.

There used to be two beautiful train stations in New York City: Grand Central Station, which still exists and is still beautiful, and Pennsylvania Station, which still exists and is, well, no longer beautiful. The reason Pennsylvania Station is no longer beautiful is that the original Pennsylvania Station was torn down in 1963.  This made room for Madison Square Garden and the new Penn Station, which is called many things, but never "beautiful." The old Penn Station was built in 1910. Historian Michael Beschloss tweeted a picture of it recently. That picture, which is from 1929, is below, along with one of Grand Central (?) with the same sun-beam effect. And there's a link to more pictures of the old Penn Station at the bottom of the page. Out with the old and in with the new makes sense sometimes. But in this case, it came at a big cost. Michael Beschloss ArchivesSEE ALSO: More Gorgeous Pictures Of Penn Station Before It Was Demolished
Marcus Nelson/Flickr Two massive pension funds are getting together to wage a proxy battle that would completely wipe out and rebuild Yahoo's Board of Directors at the company's meeting tomorrow, but it's time to get real — they probably won't get what they want. At least not exactly. Proxy battles became en vogue in 2012 as hedge fund managers, pension funds, and other big-time shareholders started demanding more from the boards of the companies in which they invested. The trend has continued into 2013, and it's true that the dissidents in these fights have been gaining more ground as time goes on. Still, proxy battles are really hard to win outright— especially at big firms with popular CEOs (see JP Morgan). Lets look at what's gone down so far this year. The biggest company to lose to a dissident during the shareholder voting process in 2013 so far has been IGT, it's the largest casino gaming machine manufacturer in the world. The dissident in the tussle was hedge fund manager Jason Ader of Ader Investments. His hedge fund owns 3% of the company, and he's also the Director of Las Vegas Sands Corp (so no stranger to the industry). As IGT's March board meeting neared, Las Vegas was abuzz with the story. Employees spoke out against the CEO, management, the company's creativity and more. Still, when it came to a vote, Ader only got 1 out of 3 people he nominated onto IGT's board. This game is not for the weak stomached. Now, Ader's victory happened at a $4 billion company with an unpopular CEO and it was quite a coup. Yahoo has a market cap of $27 billion and Marissa Mayer at the helm, so the pension funds waging a winner-take-all fight there are in for an even tougher battle. That's why, if the dissidents cause enough of a stink, they could perhaps get the company to negotiate. That's what happened last month when hedge fund manager Paul Singer waged a proxy battle against Hess (a company with a $21.7 billion market cap). According to the NYT, Hess and Singer negotiated into the wee hours of the morning before the company's scheduled shareholder meeting. From NYT: After talks that stretched to dawn Hess agreed to give its opponent, the activist hedge fund Elliott Management, three board seats in exchange for the fund’s support of the company’s slate of five directors. All told, nine new directors will join the board. Not bad, but certainly not the total victory mutual fund company Calvert and Christian Brothers Investment Services are going for. But then again, maybe removing the entire board is just a (really high) jumping off point. Who in their right mind would actually think Dan Loeb would be peacefully dislodged from a board anyway? Below, check out a table that rounds up some of the hottest proxy battles of the year, from Institutional Shareholder Services. It'll give you an even better sense of how complicated this stuff is.

Protectionism has been on the rise among both emerging and developed markets ever since the financial crisis. Countries around the world have unleashed tariffs, quotas and other restrictive trade policies in their efforts to boost their own economies. In a new report, Societe Generale's Patrick Legland points out that G8 economies accounted for 30% of all protectionist measures announced in the last 12 months. They were also the main targets of such measures, according to Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR).Â  Protectionist measures are often met with retaliation in the form of more protectionist measures.  All of this is bad news for the global economy, which is struggling to maintain growth.  Recently, the European Commission tossed anti-dumping duties on Chinese solar panels.Â  Not long after, China said it could levy taxes on luxury car imports. Considering the weakness in Europe's auto market â€” sales fell to a 20-year low in May â€” this raised concerns for Germany.Â Â  "As protectionism was one of the key factors that aggravated the 1929 crisis, the recent return of beggar-thy-neighbour policies could hamper the fragile recovery in world economies. Thus, with the end of cheap money from the Fed, one of the major threats for global growth now stems from the rise in protectionism. Moreover, the international spillover from unconventional monetary policies could increase this risk in the future." The concern is that with global central banks preparing to wind down their easy money policies, the next shock could come from global trade and protectionism. "...Global growth (and employment) is highly correlated with international trade. In the EU, which suffers from a high unemployment level, world trade represents 30 million jobs, according to the European Commission (EC). Given the persistent trade slowdown since the crisis and its impact on global growth, the G8 summit put the issue back in focus last week, with the launch of negotiations for a transatlantic trade agreement between the US and Europe." Here's a chart from Societe Generale that shows an estimate of new protectionist measures implemented each quarter: Societe Generale
Vogue / YouTube screencapHarvard economics professor Greg Mankiw has written a paper called "Defending the One Percent" which makes the case against reducing inequality as an economic policy goal. Mankiw was a top advisor to Mitt Romney, who said during the 2012 campaign that inequality ought to be discussed in "quiet rooms" but was being oversold by the Obama campaign. Like Jonathan Chait, I'm not impressed by Mankiw's paper. In particular, Mankiw totally brushes past the strongest argument for income redistribution—wealthy people have a lower marginal utility of money than poorer people, meaning they get less happiness out of an added dollar of consumption. But Mankiw made one observation that, unintentionally, got at how economists are looking at tax policy in an outdated way. Today's rich are very different from the rich in previous decades. They produce different kinds of things and probably respond differently to taxes. Mankiw writes: [I]t seems that changes in technology have allowed a small number of highly educated and exceptionally talented individuals to command superstar incomes in ways that were not possible a generation ago. Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee (2011) advance this thesis forcefully in their book Race Against the Machine. They write (p. 44), "Aided by digital technologies, entrepreneurs, CEOs, entertainment stars, and financial executives have been able to leverage their talents across global markets and capture reward that would have been unimaginable in earlier times." Paul Krugman addressed a related matter on his blog last week: [T]here is at least one important respect in which the 21st-century economy is different in a way that ought to have a significant effect on macroeconomics: the much larger role of rents on intangible assets... Consider the changing identity of the most valuable company in America... The reality is that [Apple] is basically built around technology, design, and a brand identity. There are a couple of obvious implications from this change in the nature of corporate success. One is that profits are no longer anything remotely resembling a “natural” aspect of the economy; they’re very much an artifact of antitrust policy or the lack thereof, intellectual property policy, etc. Another is that a lot of what we consider output is “produced” at low or zero marginal cost. In this environment, the traditional way in which economists estimate the economic effects of taxes does not look apt. Normally, economists model labor as something that employees sell to employers. Raise income taxes and you cut the price received by the employee, so he works less. Cut taxes and he works more. A cardiologist might behave exactly like that, doing more procedures if his taxes are cut. But Lady Gaga can't very easily decide to produce twice as many hit songs. She might only have so many good ideas. And unlike the cardiologist, producers of ideas have had big, positive pre-tax shocks to their income. Being able to sell into a global market and scale up quickly means a great idea is worth a lot more than it used to be. Even if the share of that value that is captured by the idea generator gets cut—whether through a tax increase or a weakening of intellectual property protections—creating great ideas should be more appealing than ever. This is more or less what is happening in creative industries. Piracy has undercut royalties to artists. The ease of generating cheap internet content has cut payments to writers. People who work in these industries talk about these phenomena like they are crises. But content keeps getting both better and more plentiful. Musicians and writers have gone, over the last 10 years, though shifts in their sectors that look an awful lot like big income tax increases. And it's been bad for workers in those sectors. But it's not at all clear that it's been bad for the economy or for consumers—in fact, it's probably been good. One possible lesson here is that economic shifts raising the value of ideas have made it possible and desirable to cut the share of the value from idea generation that goes to idea generators. That is, idea generators are less sensitive to taxes than they used to be. In the case of superstar high earners, we could do that by raising taxes at the top, or we could do it by directly attacking the rents and intellectual property protections that Krugman identifies. Or maybe this isn't the right approach. Maybe great ideas have become so valuable that disincentives to their creation have become drastically more costly. But that's the discussion that needs to be had—do "superstars" really need to get such a large fraction of the surplus they produce lest they slack off? Or, like rank and file musicians and writers, can we cut their earnings with near impunity?
Google FinanceAt its lowest point of the day the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down by over 250 points. Now it's down by just around 60 points. Considering all of the negatively-biased volatility in the markets lately, it almost feels like an up-day. The selling began after the People's Bank of China failed to alleviate concerns that its economy was walking into a banking crisis. China's Shanghai Composite got slammed, falling into a bear market. Meanwhile, interest rates have been surging.Â  The 10-year Treasury rate went north of 2.6% for the first time in years.
flickr/Louish Pixel Markets in the U.S. are coming off of their lows of the days. Currently, the Dow is down 110 points, or 0.7%.  The S&amp;P 500 is down 17 points or 1.0%. Earlier today, the Dow was down as much as 254 points. This comes after hawkish commentary from the People's Bank of China sent the Shanghai Composite crashing into a bear market (i.e. down 20% from its highs). However, the biggest story in the markets right now may be the tumbling Treasury security market, which sent the 10-year Treasury yield above 2.6% for the first time in years. "China entered a bear market as their market plunged another 800 Dow point equivalents, amid headlines about the severity of the "crisis" in their shadow banking system," said UBS's Art Cashin in a note to traders this morning.  "Things like that used to inspire a flight to safety into U.S. Treasuries.  No sign this morning as yield on 10 year pushes against 2.6%."

The newsroom at Business Insider These days, it seems like interns everywhere are suing their old bosses. Hey interns — cut it out. You are extremely lucky to have an internship, even if it's unpaid. Look, I feel you. I had six internships before I was officially hired as a reporter. Out of those six jobs, two of them were unpaid. So I can relate to interns like Alex Footman and Eric Glatt, two former Fox Searchlight interns who told The New York Times they had to make coffee, take out the trash, and clean up the production room on the "Black Swan" film set. Or Diana Wang, who unsuccessfully sued Hearst in 2012 for back wages from Harper's Bazaar, alleging to magazine internship website Ed2010 that "the type of work that interns were doing at Bazaar put them at risk safety-wise" by returning bags of clothes and accessories around New York City. I even had virtually the same experience as the two Condé Nast interns Lauren Ballinger and Matthew Leib who recently launched yet another lawsuit. Both were barely paid during their time at the media conglomerate, and were doing the jobs of full-time employees. A few of my "paid" internships were barely paid, too. I once received a stipend of $400 a month to live in New York City while working 45 hours a week. Another internship was a sponsored position through my college's art history program, where I received $1,000 a month while living in an MIT frat house over the summer to save money. For a year before I was officially hired full-time at Business Insider (where all interns are paid), I also served and hosted at various restaurants on weekends and the odd weeknight to supplement my income, if I had one. It was normal for me to work seven days a week, and I was exhausted. But I also recognized how fortunate I was. Not only did my parents help me financially when I was in dire straights, but they also let their grown daughter live with them for six months while she interned and saved money to move to New York City. I could afford to take unpaid internships (or virtually unpaid), learn from my coworkers, and network. So that's exactly what I did. Many internships suck. You're the lowest on the totem pole, and your responsibilities aren't always the exciting start in the industry you thought they'd be. You won't always feel appreciated. Sometimes, you might actually feel invisible.* But not every young adult has the luxury of working an internship, paid or not. In the real world, people take jobs that they don't love all the time because they need to make ends meet. And those who dream of going into creative careers are often held back because they can't afford to take an unpaid job, even if they work a second one. I strongly believe that all internships should be paid. It makes interns feel valued and gives them a financial boost, even if it's a small one. But this is not always the reality we live in. And I'm not convinced that suing huge companies (with more money and more lawyers than you) helps, apart from making a whole lot more "unpaid" internships for school credit only (which opens up a whole other can of worms, because you're paying for school while working — you are essentially paying to work). Plus, suing is a long, drawn out process that could hurt your career as well as the company you were originally so excited to join. If you have the privilege and the opportunity to take an unpaid internship — even if it means taking a second job to support yourself — do it. Learn from it. Work your hardest and impress your boss. You are investing in your future career, networking with people in your chosen field, and getting hands-on experience. And after work, grab a drink with your fellow beleaguered interns. Complain about your boss, your apartment, and your financial situation. Wish that you were paid, and loudly complain that you aren't. But leave the bitching at the bar. *If you're being sexually harassed, working inhumane hours, or are in any way being abused, you absolutely need to stand up for yourself. Ignore everything I just said and sue, sue, sue!
A statement from the People's Bank of China on Monday made it clear that Chinese policymakers are willing to take on short term pain (spiking interbank rates and a liquidity squeeze) for longer term gains (more stable economic growth). In fact policymakers have been pushing through reforms on new financing channels for some time now. Here's a quick recap: One of the biggest debates following China's leadership handover in November 2012 was whether the new leadership was committed to reform. Reforms rolled out since then have shown that policymakers are willing to rebalance their growth model and push through economic reforms, even if broader political reforms take more time to manifest.

Big state companies in industries struggling with over-capacity but with easy access to credit are borrowing funds, not to invest in their business but to lend to smaller firms sometimes at several times the official interest rate, part of an informal lending market in China that authorities are taking aim at. China's central bank increased pressure on banks to rein in such informal lending and speculative trading last week in money markets, letting short-term interest rates spike to extraordinary levels. In the $3.7 trillion so-called shadow banking market, the fastest growing area is in so-called entrusted loans, which are arranged by banks on the companies' behalf, and in bankers' acceptance notes, tradable securities that give a steady flow of cash. Issuance of entrusted loans and bankers' acceptance notes has more than doubled to 1.6 trillion yuan ($261 billion) in the first four months of this year from 636 billion yuan a year ago. "Can we use the money to expand production? Definitely not," said a deputy general manager at a state-owned steel firm in the eastern Shandong province, speaking on condition of anonymity. "We will lose more if we produce more. We can only rely on other channels," he added, noting the firm loses an average 100-200 yuan per metric ton (1.1023 tons) of steel sold. China's economic growth is widely expected to slow further in the current quarter as exporters struggle with weak global markets, making lending money an increasingly attractive business option. But there are concerns that some of the money is going into areas the government would rather it did not, for example real estate speculation, raising the risk of it turning bad while not helping the economy out of its current slowdown. Indeed, debt is shaping up to be China's biggest financial problem. The cabinet has said it would control the flow of new money into industries struggling with overcapacity. Beijing worries the shadow banking market is creating asset-price bubbles, and the central bank has tried to put a barrier in the way of it in recent weeks by declining to inject major funds into money markets. The shadow banking system has arisen because main stream banking is focused on the needs of big state-owned enterprises. Ratings agency S&amp;P has estimated that outstanding shadow banking credit totaled $3.7 trillion by the end of 2012, equal to 44 percent of GDP. Fitch has put it at about 60 percent, saying "torrid growth" has made the total of all forms of credit, including regular lending, shadow and hidden underground lending, as much as 200 percent of GDP. "This is a very, very big problem for the economy," said Wei Yao, China economist at Societe Generale in Hong Kong. "The existence of all these arbitrage efforts shows that in the real economy, there are few opportunities. You've limited all the opportunities for real growth, then you open a window in the financial markets; of course everyone goes there!" With entrusted loans, a company provides the funds but, to circumvent a ban on direct lending to other firms, it designates a commercial bank to lend the money to a specific borrower. The lender stipulates the amount, tenor, and rate of the loan, while the banks earn fees from both sides without the loans showing up on their balance sheets. The average monthly amount of new entrusted loans was 179 billion yuan in the first four months of 2013, up from an average of 106 billion yuan a month last year. The steel company manager said he borrows from banks around the 6 percent official rate, then issues an entrusted loan to a borrower at up to twice that rate. The general manager of a local government-controlled glass company in the northern province of Hebei said his company has increased the use of such practices as business slowed, lending about 30 to 40 million yuan so far this year at around 6 to 7 percent mainly to related firms. Some private companies are also cashing in. Zhejiang Longsheng Group Co Ltd, a specialty chemicals maker based near Shanghai, detailed 50 entrusted loans worth 3 billion yuan outstanding in its 2012 annual report. The company lent to subsidiaries at rates of 6 to 7 percent, but unrelated companies were charged as much as 25 percent. It said one of the loans, with a rate of 20 percent, would be rolled over as the borrower had difficulty repaying it. Companies are also buying bank acceptance notes, transferable bills issued by other banks that can be sold for cash. These companies sell the bills and use part of the cash raised to make loans and the rest to buy more bills, thus ensuring a continuous churn of funds and income. The average monthly amount of bank acceptance bills issued so far this year has more than doubled to 222.8 billion yuan compared with an average of 87.5 billion yuan for all of 2012. A chief worry is that the newly generated money is finding its way into speculative real estate, complicating China's three-year fight against a property bubble. New home prices in May rose from a year earlier at their fastest pace in more than two years. An official at the statistics department of the central bank's Dalian office, who asked not to be identified, said that among all the entrusted loans issued in 2012 in the northeastern city, about 30 percent went to the real estate sector at an average interest rate of 12 percent. Another official at the central bank's Chongqing office said finance companies and credit guarantee firms affiliated to state-owned enterprises are major issuers of such loans. "In our city, there is an estimated 50 percent or more of such loans flowing into the property sector and local government financing vehicles," said the official. "The injection of entrusted loans partially helps pull down the bad loan ratio in the property sector and local financing firms, but the risks keep brewing there and could become acute if the economy slows further."

Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Calvert and Christian Brothers Investment Services, two major US pension funds which between them manage $16bn (Â£10.4bn) of assets, have voted for every Yahoo! director to be removed from the board ahead of its annual shareholder meeting on Tuesday. Both institutional investors are known for campaigning for improvements to companies' corporate governance standards, but the revolt against Yahoo! comes as a surprise given the revolving door to its boardroom over the last few years. Ten of the company's 11 directors joined in 2012 after a major board shake-up instigated by activist investor Dan Loeb, founder of Third Point Capital, who ended up joining their ranks in May last year. The longest-standing director is Sue James, a former partner at Ernst &amp; Young, who was appointed at Yahoo! in January 2010. She is the only boardroom figure to have survived a tumultuous period for Yahoo!. The company has had four chief executives in four years, ending with Ms Meyer, who joined from Google in July last year and has been tasked with turning the ailing web business around. Last month, the 38-year-old, sealed her first major acquisition at Yahoo!, paying $1.1bn for the photo-sharing site Tumblr . She also instituted a controversial ban on staff working from home, and has discreetly cut around 1000 of Yahoo!'s 15,000 staff, according to reports. The company has made quiet moves to extricate itself from its deal for Microsoft to fuel Yahoo!'s search engine, although the two companies are still tied to a 10-year agreement. Despite the Tumblr acquisition and the operational efficiencies Ms Mayer has achieved, she still has some distance to go to set out a clear growth strategy for Yahoo!, which was once the darling of the technology industry but has now lost its place to the likes of Google and Facebook. Calvert and CBIS were unavailable for comment.

Traders are starting to wonder whether the S&amp;P 500's breakout above 1575 (its 2007 high) was just a drill â€” a "false breakout." The S&amp;P hit the high in April, and there was talk of a false breakout then, but the index just kept climbing, and everyone forgot to be scared in the middle of the party. Then, last Thursday the S&amp;P started its dramatic descent back toward 1575. Now, in this morning's market culling, the index is at 1561. "It was all a dream ..." All this is almost the equivalent of saying the market's been living a fantasy for the past couple of months, and now in the midst of all this crazy news from around the world, it's coming back to reality. Traders are starting to get worried. Take Enis Taner over at Risk Reversal, for example. He wrote in a note this morning that he believes the market has been "running on fumes" for months. Maybe other traders have been preparing for the correction that could be coming (or is here) â€” either way, this spells volatility. From Risk Reversal: Considering how many traders were watching this breakout level 3 months ago, I am confident that a lot of long-term positioning was based around the breach of 1575 to the upside. A push back below could trigger a lot of long-term sell stops. As is customary with markets, this important long-term level coincides with a very jittery international market backdrop. Should be another volatile week, to say the least. As the old trader saying goes, from failed moves come fast moves. If 1575 fails, buckle up. That said, this all could be a technical blip, meaning the dream lives on. Watch the plunge in the chart below (via Yahoo Finance): Yahoo Finance
We recently had Glenn Hubbard, dean of the Columbia Graduate School of Business, into discuss his book Balance: The Economics of Great Powers from Ancient Rome to Modern America. Hubbard's main argument is that the US must reduce its long-term deficit, and that if it's not addressed, then within 20 years the US will see a "doomsday scenario" of virtually no social spending and monstrous taxes.  
The yield on the 10-Year Treasury is up 13 basis points today, to 2.63%. Interest rates have been exploding recently — at their highest levels since August 2011. The chart below, via Bespoke Investment Group, shows just how extended we are. The 10-year yield is up to 33.3% above its 50-day moving average, the farthest it has been above its 50-day in at least 50 years. This just goes to show how quickly rates have been surging. "Talk about extended!" exclaim the folks at Bespoke. "At what point does this see at least a short-term turnaround?" Bespoke Investment
Reuters/Cathal McNaughtonA top banker with the financial institution that almost bankrupted Ireland boasted that he had picked the figure of â‚¬7bn (Â£5.9bn) they told the Irish government was needed to rescue the Anglo Irish Bank "out of his arse." Taped phone calls between two senior executives at Anglo Irish have compounded suspicions in the Republic that bankers lured the then Fianna FÃ¡il led government during the crash of September 2008 into a costly financial trap by saving the debt-stricken bank with public money. In the end the Irish taxpayer was forced to hand over â‚¬30bn to save Anglo Irish Bank from collapse and resulted in the state going cap in hand to the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the EU to save the country from national bankruptcy. The bank's audio recordings â€“ obtained by The Irish Independent â€“ are of conversations between two senior Anglo Irish managers in September 2008, John Bowe and Peter Fitzgerald. Initially the bank had asked Ireland's central Bank for â‚¬7bn to prop up its parlous finances following the Irish property crash. Critics of the bailout have insisted Anglo Irish bank executives always knew that the figure would be far higher â€“ ultimately more than four times higher. On tape Fitzgerald asks Bowe how did he arrive at the figure of â‚¬7bn to which the latter replies: "Just as Drummer [the then Anglo Irish Bank CEO David Drumm now in exile and disgrace in Boston] would say, 'picked it out my arse.'" The conversation also tends to back up the view that Anglo Irish bankers knew that â‚¬7bn would never be enough to save the bank but once they had hoodwinked the Dublin government the taxpayer would keep picking up the tab. In their exchange Bowe says: "Yeah, and that number is seven, but the reality is that actually we need more than that. But you know the strategy here is you pull them in, you get them to write a big cheque and they have to keep, they have to have support their money, you know." On the Irish government getting entrapped by Anglo, Bowe adds: "If they say, if they saw the enormity of it up front, they might decide, they might decide they have a choice. You know what I mean? They might say the cost to the taxpayer is too high. But ... em ... if it doesn't look big at the outset ... if it looks big, big enough to be important, but not too big that it kind of spoils everything, then then I think you have a chance." The two bankers are also heard laughing and joking at a time when the bank was tottering on the brink of destruction. They are heard saying they hope the bank is nationalised so "we'd keep our jobs". Bowe who was approached over the weekend about the 2008 conversations claimed the remarks were "off-the-cuff comments" and denied he was trying to mislead the state with underestimated figures. Fitzgerald released a statement through his solicitor stating that "I am not nor have I ever been aware of a strategy or intention on the part of the Anglo Irish Bank to mislead authorities in relation to the forecasted funding position of Anglo Irish Bank." Despite the pair's denials, the taped conversations at a critical time in the toxic bank's history will increase the pressure for a full parliamentary inquiry into the bank rescue deal which cost the taxpayer a further â‚¬30bn after two other debt-ridden banks, the Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Bank had to be saved from collapse. Unlike the United States, no senior Irish banker has gone to jail or been found guilty in any court so far. The leading lights in Anglo, once regarded as masters of the financial universe who kept fuelling the Celtic Tiger, are now among the most hated figures in the Republic's history. Anglo Irish Bank epitomised the rise and ignominious fall of the Celtic Tiger economy. It was the preferred lender for property speculators and builders. Among its stellar business clients was Ireland's one-time richest man Sean Quinn who borrowed hundreds of millions of euros from Anglo Irish to fund the building of a worldwide property which has since melted away. Quinn's gambling with Anglo Irish's loans resulted in him being made bankrupt and finally jailed for failing to hand over assets to the bank once it was nationalised.

MovieClips / YouTubeKill Bill Vol. 2 There's been a lot of talk about SHIBOR (China's version of LIBOR) and how it's been spiking lately, indicating that liquidity is very tight in China's banking system. Rates began spiking before the Dragon Boat festival earlier this month. While rates appear to have peaked, they remain at elevated levels. The People's Bank of China watched in silence for several days before injecting a targeted 50 billion yuan into markets last week. This inaction from the PBOC made markets very nervous. But a statement from the central bank last night stating that "overall bank liquidity conditions are at a reasonable level", and that banks should "prudently manage liquidity risks that have resulted from rapid credit expansion," caused the Chinese stock market to hemorrhage.Â  We previously noted that the central bank was punishing banks that that had taken advantage of stable interbank rates to fund their purchase of higher-yield bonds. And that Chinese policymakers are trying to channel liquidity into sectors that will help drive growth. "As such, the statement confirmed market speculation that the cash squeeze is being tolerated by the PBoC as a warning to banks to curtail their aggressive lending practices and reduce risky activities in the shadow banking market," according to Stephen Schwartz and Carrie Liu at BBVA Research. In a new report titled 'China â€” Doctor Li Keqiang's surgery,' Stephen Green writesÂ  that "via higher interbank rates, the PBoC is telling banks they need to source their own liquidity, reduce their reliance on such products [WMPs], and not expect the PBoC to bail them out when they face a cash squeeze." China's Xi-Li leadership appears committed to reforms and willing to accept slower growth and short-term hits to ensure the longer-term health of the economy. So the question on everyone's mind is how much of a liquidity crunch will the Chinese central bank tolerate. "Surgery is meant to cure, not kill, the patient â€“ and while some pain is inevitable, we firmly believe the PBoC is in control," said Green. The central bank can address a severe cash crunch through various tools. It could reverse repo transactions, cut the reserve requirement ratio, add liquidity through short-term liquidity operations (SLOs), though this tool has yet to be used. "Immediately there are gonna be convulsions, which they're going to address in the short-term with re-injections of capital," Arthur Dong, professor of strategy and economics at Georgetown University told Business Insider. "In the longer term the senior party leadership has pretty much sent the signal, and they're sending it through the PBoC as well as through their banking systems, that the day of wine and roses, the days of free and unlimited capital are over." We previously argued that some of the rhetoric comparing it to the run up in rates prior to the Lehman crisis and the freezing of interbank liquidity in the U.S. are exaggerated. Green also thinks such comparisons are "unhelpful." 'This is not a run on liquidity caused by a credit event. Instead, we believe it is a deliberate policy meant to de-risk the interbank system," he writes. What's more overall interbank lending accounts for just 8% of total banks' assets and isn't as significant in China as it is in developed markets. "Also since China's interbank market is not as important to Chinese banks' funding as in developed markets, inflicting pains here may just be an affordable experiment from the vantage point of policymaker," writes Societe Generale's Wei Yao. Markets should expect interbank rates to be elevated till July.
WikimediaThe Dallas Federal Reserve says its index surged to +6.5. Economists estimated an improvement of just -1.5 compared with -10.5 in May. The survey queries Texas manufacturers about the state's business climate. The production index hit its highest reading in more than two years, while company outlook rose to a 16-month high. Here's the full report: Texas factory activity increased sharply in June, according to business executives responding to the Texas Manufacturing Outlook Survey. TheÂ productionÂ index, a key measure of state manufacturing conditions, rose six points to 17.1, posting its highest reading in more than two years. Notably stronger manufacturing activity was reflected in other survey measures as well. TheÂ new ordersÂ index climbed to 13 in June, a level not seen since July 2011. TheÂ capacity utilizationÂ index rose to a two-year high, jumping from 6.4 to 15.3. TheÂ shipmentsÂ index advanced 12 points to 15.4. Perceptions of broader business conditions rebounded strongly in June. TheÂ general business activityÂ index rose to 6.5 after posting negative readings in April and May. TheÂ company outlookÂ index soared 20 points to 13.3, reaching its highest level in 16 months. Labor market indicators reflected steady labor demand and longer workweeks. TheÂ employmentÂ index was zero in June, suggesting no change in employment levels. TheÂ hours workedÂ index moved up to 4.8 after four months in negative territory. Price movements were mixed in June; input prices and wages rose while selling prices declined. TheÂ raw materials priceÂ index increased again this month, rising from 6.4 to 14.3. TheÂ wages and benefitsÂ index also strengthened, from 14 to 20, although the great majority of manufacturers continued to note no change in compensation costs. TheÂ finished goods priceÂ index remained negative for the third month in a row but moved up fromÂ -8.3Â toÂ -2.1.Â Looking ahead, 33 percent of respondents anticipate further increases in raw materials prices over the next six months, while 25 percent expect higher finished goods prices. Expectations regarding future business conditions improved significantly in June. The index of futureÂ general business activitysurged to 14.7 after negative readings in April and May. The index of futureÂ company outlookÂ rose sharply as well, coming in at 21.8. Indexes for future manufacturing activity also moved up. The Dallas Fed conducts the Texas Manufacturing Outlook Survey monthly to obtain a timely assessment of the stateâ€™s factory activity. Data were collected June 11â€“19, and 95 Texas manufacturers responded to the survey. Firms are asked whether output, employment, orders, prices and other indicators increased, decreased or remained unchanged over the previous month. Survey responses are used to calculate an index for each indicator. Each index is calculated by subtracting the percentage of respondents reporting a decrease from the percentage reporting an increase. When the share of firms reporting an increase exceeds the share reporting a decrease, the index will be greater than zero, suggesting the indicator has increased over the prior month. If the share of firms reporting a decrease exceeds the share reporting an increase, the index will be below zero, suggesting the indicator has decreased over the prior month. An index will be zero when the number of firms reporting an increase is equal to the number of firms reporting a decrease. Data have beenÂ seasonally adjustedÂ as necessary. This will be the first in what will be a closely watched blitz of economic data and Fed announcements set to come out this week.
Stock markets are getting pummeled around the world, possibly over fears of a Chinese credit crisisÂ and deceleration of Federal Reserve monetary stimulus. But Americans can take solace in one fact. Their stock market is in better shape than the rest of the world. This chart, via BTIG's Dan Greenhaus, shows global equity returns from their 2013 highs. The U.S. is still the top performer. Relatively speaking, at least, things could be worse. Dan Greenhaus/BTIG
Wikimedia CommonsOnce again, we have more embarrassing conversations between bankers ... The Irish Independent, a Dublin-based newspaper, has uncovered tapes of an internal phone conversation from September 2008 between two executives at Anglo Irish Bank during its bailout deal and they sound pretty scandalous.  The Irish Independent points out that the recordings show they misled the Central Bank. The executives from the recording have been identified as John Bowe (head of the bank's capital markets) and Peter Fitzgerald (director of retail banking). However, Bowe "categorically denied" that he misled the Central Bank and Fitzgerald, who wasn't involved in discussions with regulators, said he was unaware of any intention to mislead, the report said. Either way, the newly revealed recordings are still embarrassing. Here are some partial excerpts (via the Irish Independent): The two bankers begin their conversation jokingly comparing themselves to being able to walk on water and drink beer out of both hands. John Bowe: "Hello" Receptionist: "John I have Peter Fitz for you." Bowe: "Oh yeah, OK."  Bowe: "As me granny used to say, you must be therapeutic..." Peter Fitzgerald: "What does that mean? Can I work the computer is it? (Both laugh)  Bowe: "Therapeutic. Therapeutic...I was just ringing you."  Fitzgerald: "I'm ambidextrous as well. It means I can walk on land and water." (More laughter) Bowe: "You can drink, you can drink beer out of both hands..." (laughter) Then they get down to business.  Bowe tells Fitzgerald that they met with the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority (IFSRA) the previous day about getting €7 billion.  They laugh how they will never be able to pay it back.  Bowe:  "So we went down ... and we basically said. In Central, yeah. And I mean, to cut a long story short we sort of said. 'Look, what we need is seven billion euros...and we're going to give you and we're going to give you, what we're going to give you is our loan collateral so we're not giving you ECB, we're giving you the loan clause.  "We gave him a term sheet and we put a pro not facility together and we said that's what we need. And that kind of sobered up everybody pretty quickly, you know."  Fitzgerald: "Yeah." Fitzgerald: "And is that €7 billion a term?" Bowe: "This is €7 billion bridging."  Fitzgerald: "Yeah." Bowe: "So ... so it is bridged until we can pay you back ... which is never." (Both laugh) Then they joke how the regulators would need to change their underpants after hearing the terms of that deal.   Bowe: "So under the terms that say repayment, we say; 'No ...'" (laughter) Fitzgerald: (Laughing) "None...just none. Not applicable. OK and what did he say? 'I need a change of underwear?'  Fitzgerald: "Jesus that's a lot of dosh ... Jesus f-----g hell and God ... well do you know the Central Bank only has €14 billion of total investments so that would be going up 20 ... Gee..that would be seen. Bowe: (Laughing) "There was a bit of that ... there was a bit of that.  'And how would we do that? We would need to give you ... we need to ... 'Jesus you're kind of asking us to play ducks and drakes with the regulations.' And we said: 'Yeah.' We said: 'Look what we are telling you is if we get into difficulties, we have 100,000 plus lump sum depositors in Ireland all of whom would be very vocal.'"  Fitzgerald asks Bowe how he came up with the 7 billion figure.  Bowe responds that like then-CEO David Drumm, he picked it out of his "arse." Fitzgerald: "Ah we are, yeah, yeah and, em, what, how did you arrive at the seven?  Bowe: "Just, as Drummer would say, 'picked it out of my arse', you know. Em ... I mean, look, what we did was we basically said: 'What is the amount we can securitize over the next six months?' And basically say to them: 'Look our problem is time, it's not our ability to create the liquidity, the enemy is time here.'"  Fitzgerald: "Yeah."  Bowe: "So we can rebuild, in other words, we can rebuild the liquidity off our loan book, but what we can't do, we can't do it now and the balance sheet's leaking now."  Bowe tells Fitzgerald that they actually need more money than the 7 billion figure.   Bowe: Yeah and that number is seven, but the reality is that actually we need more than that. But the strategy here is you pull them in, you get them to write a big [check] and they have to keep, they have to support their money, you know."  Fitzgerald: "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. They've got skin in the game and that's the key." Bowe: "They have and they have invested a lot. If they saw, if they saw, the enormity of it up front, they might decide, they might decide they have a choice. You know what I mean? They might say the cost to the taxpayer is too high. But ... em ... if it doesn't look too big at the outset...if it looks big, big enough to be important, but not too big that it kind of spoils everything, Fitzgerald: "Yeah, Yeah."  ....

Dr. Ed's Blog Thatâ€™s quite a worry list that piled up last week. Itâ€™s remarkable that the S&amp;P 500 didnâ€™t fall more than 2.1% last week. And so far, it is down just 4.6% from its May 21 record high. This decline is attributable to the drop in the S&amp;P 500â€™s forward P/E from 14.4 on May 21 to 13.6 on Friday. S&amp;P 500 forward earnings is actually at a record high. How much more downside might there be in the valuation multiple? It depends on how much higher the bond yield might go. My assessment is that it could rise up to 3%, which would probably attract lots of buyers. If so, then the P/E might retest and find support at the 13 level, which would knock another 4.4% off the stock index from Friday's close. That would make for a 9.0% correction in the market from May 21. Today's Morning Briefing: From Pain to Gain? (1) Litany of woes. (2) Another â€œendgameâ€ correction followed by another relief rally?

ReutersTalk about an emerging market. Citigroup will open an office in Baghdad, becoming the first U.S. bank to expand into Iraq and dive into the country's oil-rich â€”Â but politically uncertain â€”Â future, the Financial Times reports. From the FT: In the past decade, the bank has been catering to investors and large companies operating in Iraq, offering products such as trade finance, cash management and investment banking services through its regional hub in Dubai, its Iraq-desk in Amman and via London. Citiâ€™s move to establish a physical foothold in the market comes as major international oil groups as well as industrial and construction companies are looking to invest in Iraq. Citigroup estimates that Iraq will turn into a $2 trillion economy by 2050, according to the report. Certainly not the first entity to land in Iraq and hope it works out, Citi's "toe in the water" strategy will lay the groundwork for an eventual full-scale shop, sources told the FT.

From @bondvigilantes, a great single slide showing how hard the Brazilian bond market has gotten crushed. Brazil is not a unique case. It's similar to other emerging markets in that it's getting whacked by a double-whammy of slowing growth (domestically and in China) and a new financial regime that's causing dollars to get sucked out thanks to higher interest rates in the US. @bondvigilantes
Executive pay for top bank chiefs dropped 10% last year, according to a report from the Financial Times. The heads of 15 banks netted $11.5 million on average in 2012, the first pay cut for the masters of the universe in three years. From the FT: Last yearâ€™s fall in pay coincides with an average drop in net income by more than a fifth across those 15 lenders. But it also comes amid a share price recovery in the sector, with all but two of the banks â€“Â BBVAÂ andÂ Credit SuisseÂ â€“ outperforming the FTSE World index in 2012. Of the 10 bankers that were in office since the beginning of 2011, only three â€“ John Stumpf atÂ Wells Fargo, Stuart Gulliver atÂ HSBCÂ and Brady Dougan atÂ Credit SuisseÂ â€“ enjoyed pay rises. JP Morgan's Jamie Dimon saw his pay package cut by a fifth last year, to a measly $18.7 million. And he can expect it to drop even further next year thanks to the London Whale episode, the FT notes. The reduction comes as chief executive pay across other sectors remained stable, indicating aÂ narrowing of the pay premiumÂ that financial services companies built up in the credit-fuelled pre-crisis years. Average pay for S&amp;P 500 chief executives serving at least two full years was $11m, a 0.3 per cent decrease according to Equilar. While investor pressure has curbed banker bonuses in America, the EU will take it one step further and legally cap rewards next year. Read the full report at the Financial Times&gt;
REUTERS/Sukree SukplangMark Mobius While China's housing market problems are similar in scale to those faced during the U.S. subprime mortgage bubble and its banks are rife with bad loans, it won't lead to another Lehman-style crash, Franklin Templeton's Mark Mobius told CNBC on Monday. Mobius said the similarities could not be denied but since Chinese banks are owned by the government, they will not be allowed to fail. Investor fears have been heightened after a credit crunch last week led to a spike in yields on inter-bank loans. Some analysts have pointed out the credit crunch was spiked by China's central bank tightening liquidity, rather than a loss in confidence among banks. (Read More: China's Central Bank Plays Hardball – Will It Backfire?) Still, nervousness led to big drop in Chinese stocks on Monday, with the Shanghai Composite tumbling 5.3 percent to its lowest levels since early December. "The perception of China is they are in the same kind of situation as the U.S., and yes it is true that a lot of loans are going to go bad, and that banks have been hiding a lot of these loans in so called trust companies," Mobius said on the sidelines of the FundForum conference of asset managers in Monaco. "We have to ask what the consequence is, what will happen as a result, and the scenario will be very, very different in China, simply because the banks are controlled by the government, so they will not be allowed to go bankrupt." As a result, Mobius said the liquidity problems faced by Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers at the height of the 2008 crisis won't happen in China. Mobius manages some $53 billion in emerging market funds and has more money invested in China than in any other market.

But not everyone agrees that China can make it through its current problems. Gordon Chang, the author of "The Coming Collapse of China" told CNBC on Monday the credit crunch was a serious problem and could lead to a "catastrophic failure" in the banking system in the next six months. "This is not so much as a liquidity crisis as a debt crisis," he told CNBC on Monday.

For the holiday quarter, he says Apple is planning to build 50-55 million iPhone units, down from an original build plan of 60-55 million units.Â  If this report is accurate, Apple's iPhone business will only grow 4.6% on a year-over-year basis during this year's holiday quarter. Continued sluggish growth will weigh on Apple's stock unless it has new products to get people excited.Â  Misek is cutting his price target to $405, down from $420 on these new iPhone build plans.Â 
AP BEIJING (AP) — An American executive said Monday he has been held hostage for four days at his medical supply plant in Beijing by scores of workers demanding severance packages like those given to 30 co-workers in a phased-out department. Chip Starnes, 42, a co-owner of Coral Springs, Florida-based Specialty Medical Supplies, said local officials had visited the 10-year-old plant on the capital's outskirts and coerced him into signing agreements Saturday to meet the workers' demands even though he sought to make clear that the remaining 100 workers weren't being laid off. The workers were expecting wire transfers by Tuesday, he said, adding that about 80 of them had been blocking every exit around the clock and depriving him of sleep by shining bright lights and banging on windows of his office. He declined to clarify the amount, saying he wanted to keep it confidential. "I feel like a trapped animal," Starnes told The Associated Press on Monday from his first-floor office window, while holding onto the window's bars. "I think it's inhumane what is going on right now. I have been in this area for 10 years and created a lot of jobs and I would never have thought in my wildest imagination something like this would happen." Workers inside the compound, a pair of two-story buildings behind gates and hedges in the Huairou district of the northeastern Beijing suburbs, repeatedly declined requests for comment, saying they did not want to talk to foreign media. It is not rare in China for managers to be held by workers demanding back pay or other benefits, often from their Chinese owners, though occasionally also involving foreign bosses. The labor action reflects growing uneasiness among workers about their jobs amid China's slowing economic growth and the sense that growing labor costs make the country less attractive for some foreign-owned factories. The account about local officials coercing Starnes to meet workers' demands — if true — reflects how officials typically consider stifling unrest to be a priority. Huairou district and Qiaozi township governments declined to comment. A local police spokesman said police were at the scene to maintain order. Four uniformed police and about a dozen other men who declined to identify themselves were standing across the road from the plant. "As far as I know, there was a labor dispute between the workers and the company management and the dispute is being solved," said spokesman Zhao Lu of the Huairou Public Security Bureau. " I am not sure about the details of the solution, but I can guarantee the personal safety of the manager." Representatives from the U.S. Embassy stood outside the gate much of the day, and eventually were let in. U.S. Embassy spokesman Nolan Barkhouse said the two sides were on the verge of an agreement and that Starnes would have access to his attorneys. It was unclear what agreement might be reached, and subsequent attempts to contact Starnes were not immediately successful. Starnes said the company had gradually been winding down its plastics division, planning to move it to Mumbai, India. He arrived in Beijing last Tuesday to lay off the last 30 people. Some had been working there for up to nine years, so their compensation packages were "pretty nice," he said. Some of the workers in the other divisions got wind of this, and, coupled with rumors that the whole plant was moving to India, started demanding similar severance packages on Friday. Christian Murck, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said he wasn't familiar with Starnes' case, but that such hostage-taking was "not a major problem" for the foreign business community. "It happened more often say 15 years ago than today, but it still happens from time to time," he said. "It rarely leads to personal harm to the managers involved, but there are cases when it has in years past." Copyright (2013) Associated Press. All rights reserved.

US equities are headed for a big fall today. And Chinese stocks cratered last night on People's Bank of China tightness. But the big story is, once again, the relentless move higher in US interest rates. Just in the middle of last week, you had investors predicting that rates on the US 10-year wouldn't surpass 2.5% in all of 2013. Today, 10-year rates have blown past 2.6% They're currently at 2.64%.

REUTERS/Bobby YipEdward SnowdenGood morning. Here's what you need to know.
From Dave Lutz of Stifel, Nicolaus, here's the super short-and-sweet version of what traders are talking about today. Equity Futures are tracking much weaker, with SPX off 90bp â€“ tracking losses overseas.Â  Germanyâ€™s DAX is off almost 2%, as EU fins are weaker due to higher yields pressuring the PIIGs spreads.Â  All eyes were on the Shanghai Composite hit for 5%+, itâ€™s worse loss in 4 years - to end at the lowest point in nearly seven months - equity traders appeared spooked by the PBoCâ€™s comments on Monday that liquidity was â€œreasonableâ€ and this contributed to bloodletting in Chinese financial stocks - The shares of midsize Chinese banks, which were the most aggressive in risky financing behavior that contributed to the current liquidity squeeze, suffered the heaviest selling.Â  The Nikkei was hit for 1.2% as the Yen broke higher against the Dollar â€“ Aussie was hit for 1.5% (China Spillover) â€“ and those Asian Peripherals like Thailand, Philippines hit for over 2%.Â  Yields globally are breaking higher, with the US 10YY at 2.65%, Some moderate leaking of PIIGs debt (Focus on Italy Bond Auction this week) -Â  There is $99bn of new Treasury debt spread across the two, five and seven-year sectors this week in what shapes as a test of investor appetite for government paper.Â  With the Yen stronger and â‚¬ weaker, the DXY is starting the week on mixed footing â€“ but commodities, specifically Industrial Ones â€“ are getting hit:Â  Copper off almost 3%, Silver off 2% (UBS cuts price forecasts) and Gold off 1% (GS Cuts Prx Forecasts) â€“ Interesting though that Crude Oil is mostly mixed â€“ and the best performing commodity over the last week has been Iron Ore, gaining 6%.
Quick heads up. Futures are crumbling more. They're near their lows of the day. FinViz Markets are as a whole getting whipped, in part due to massive carnage in China.
Shanghai shares got crushed last night, and financials were really hard hit. One culprit: The People's Bank of China is showing that it's very disinclined to step in and smoothe over tight liquidity conditions. Instead it's telling the banks to deal with their own mess. Nomura's Zhiwei Zhang passes allong the message from the PBOC in a brief note The guidance note stated that “overall bank liquidity conditions are at a reasonable level” and asked banks to “prudently manage liquidity risks that have resulted from rapid credit expansion”, “appropriately contain the pace of loans and bill financing” and “utilize the stock of money and credit to support the economy”. We believe these statements suggest that the central bank's policy stance remains tight. The decision to put this note on its website suggests the PBoC wants to reiterate its policy stance.

Screenshot via The Pruitt-Igoe Myth Paul Krugman says that the Federal Reserve may have made a historic blunder this week in signaling its intent to "taper" the pace of bond purchases, with an eye towards ending them completely sometime in 2014. By taking a hawkish turn before the economy has recovered (it's still nowhere close on employment goals, and inflation trends are going the wrong way) the Fed may have lost any credibility to restimulate should it come to that. Four days after Bernanke's guns-blazing press conference, we get another datapoint indicating that the central banks of the world are ready to say "no mas" in the fight against depression. In a speech given today, Jaime Caruana, general manager of the Bank for International Settlements (which is, as Ryan Avent characterized it, kind of the central bank to the central banks), said the following: Ours is a call for acting responsibly now to strengthen growth and avoid even costlier adjustment down the road. And it is a call for recognizing that returning to stability and prosperity is a shared responsibility. Monetary policy has done its part. Recovery now calls for a different policy mix – with more emphasis on strengthening economic flexibility and dynamism and stabilizing public finances The title of Caruana's speech is "Making The Most Of Borrowed Time," and it's filled with warnings about what happens if central banks keep stimulating for too long. Read these three paragraphs. It's basically a white flag, saying we're done here: Central banks have borrowed the time that the private and public sectors need for adjustment, but they cannot substitute for it. Moreover, such borrowing has costs. As the stimulus is sustained, it magnifies the challenges of normalising monetary policy; it increases financial stability risks; and it worsens the misallocation of capital. Finally, prolonging the period of very low interest rates further exposes open economies to spillovers that are now widely recognised. The challenges are particularly severe for the emerging market economies and smaller advanced economies where credit and property prices have been rapidly growing. The risks from such a domestic credit boom at a late stage of the economic cycle are hard enough to manage. Strong capital inflows exacerbate such risks and challenges for market participants and authorities; and they expose economies to large sudden reversals if markets expect an exit from unconventional policies, as volatility during the past few weeks seems to indicate. In short, the balance of costs and benefits entailed by continued monetary easing has been deteriorating. Borrowed time should be used to restore the foundations of solid long-term growth. This includes ending the dependence on debt; improving economic flexibility to strengthen productivity growth; completing regulatory reform; and recognising the limits of what central banks can and should do. So you have the BIS and the Fed both signaling the end is nigh for how much central banks can do at this point. It looks like a central banker strike. Meanwhile, this past week, we saw the People's Bank of China allow SHIBOR (a measure of intrabank lending similar to LIBOR) to surge, in what was seen as a tool to clamp down on speculation. Ostensibly the Bank of Japan is just in the beginning of a new era of easing, though even they're internally divided according to reports. Thanks to political gridlock (especially in the U.S.), central banks have done much of the heavy lifting in the recovery. That seems to be coming to an end. Hopefully escape velocity has been achieved.
From last night's Bedtime with BTIG note, Dan Greenhaus (@danBTIG on Twitter) points to the below chart as something that's of increasing concern to investors: Â Itâ€™s all interest rates all the time it seems. For the week, the bond market was thunderstruck as the 10 year yield rose by roughly 40 bps, one of the largest yield increases in a decade. But such an increase is not exclusive to this past week; the 10 year yield was higher in seven of the last eight weeks. What has elicited a fair bit of conversation has been not the increase but the decrease in inflation expectations. Given their relationship to stock prices (see chart below), we think this conversation is warranted. For their part, stocks dropped for the fourth time in the last five weeks although as has been repeatedly noted, the cumulative drop is a relatively tame 5%. BTIG
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's cash crunch eased further on Monday after the central bank moved to prevent the money market from seizing up, but bank stocks tanked as the authorities made clear that the days of unlimited cheap official funds are over. Chinese shares suffered their biggest daily loss in nearly four years, with financial stocks dropping more than 7 percent after the People's Bank of China (PBOC) said banks needed to do a better job of managing their cash and lending. Money market rates had soared last week when the central bank, relied on as a source of cheap cash used to finance China's vast "shadow banking" system, stood pat, letting a sharp drop in fund inflows into China and cash hoarding by some banks do the rest. The sudden tightening of cash markets, which saw some banks paying a 25 percent interest rate for cash, fanned fears that Beijing's latest attempt to steer the world's second-biggest economy to more balanced growth less reliant on credit-driven investment could backfire. Under the worst-case scenario money markets could freeze, driving weaker lenders into default in a repeat of what happened in the West after the Lehman Brothers collapse in 2008. That would hit China's overall economy, its top trading partners and the global economy at large. On Monday, however, such a scenario appeared less likely, after short-term rates eased for the second straight day, though individual bank stocks fell out of favor. In a statement published on its website on Monday, the PBOC sought to calm fears that smaller players might get cut off, by suggesting bigger institutions should play their part and keep providing funding for others. "As financial institutions, especially big commercial banks, strengthen their own liquidity management, they should at the same time play to their strengths and complement the central bank in stabilizing the market." The public statement echoed points the PBOC made directly to banks in a closed-door meeting last week, just before interbank rates first began to fall back from their peak. The overnight repo rate, a key measure of funding costs in China's interbank market, fell by more than two percentage points to 6.64 percent on a weighted-average basis on Monday, its lowest since last Tuesday. It had peaked near 12 percent last Thursday. "Panic over a liquidity squeeze appears to be fading. We are lending more money out, but I did not hear about any central bank money injection into the market," said trader at a major state-owned bank in Shanghai. SMALLER BANKS HIT The monetary authority, which drew fire for keeping the market guessing about its intentions, also made a point of telling banks they could do a better job at managing cash and controlling lending. The central bank's rebuke sent shares of medium-sized lenders, which rely heavily on interbank borrowing, reeling as investors realized that costs of funding would stay elevated. "It's much easier to borrow money today, but costs remain high. Our business is apparently affected, but mainly on side business, such as wealth management," said a trader at a mid-sized commercial bank in Shanghai. The Shanghai blue-chip CSI300 indexended down 6.3 percent. [ID:nH9N0DD04R] and the financial sub-indexfell 7.4 percent, its worst day since November 2008. Beijing has long struggled to contain the growth in "shadow banking", where banks and other institutions can bypass controls on deposit and lending rates and other restrictions by offering so-called wealth-management products and other investment products. Several observers have said the monetary authorities "benign neglect" could be the most effective way of curbing the dark side of China's borrowing spree, though recent market turbulence showed how easy it was to miscalculate its side effects. The latest developments also prompted several economists to reconsider their views on how fast China's economy can grow. Both Goldman Sachs and China International Capital Corp. (CICC) downgraded their growth forecasts for this year and next with Goldman Sachs trimming its 2013 forecast to 7.4 percent from 7.8 percent and 2014 to 7.7 percent from earlier 8.4 percent. CICC cut its full 2013 growth forecast to 7.4 percent from 7.7 percent. While the adjustments are relatively small and such a rate of expansion remains within the long-term rates targeted by Beijing, market players are worried about further turbulence. "We regard China's latest moves as credit positive for the health of the Chinese banking system overall," Moody's Investors Service said in a report. "However, the method the PBOC chose to keep the banking system short of liquidity entails risks that could have credit negative implications," it said. "Persistent money market volatility similar to that of last week could result in lasting damage to confidence in the interbank market."

We mentioned this in our initial market wrap, but it's important enough that it's worth breaking out: The yield on the U.S. 10-year bond is shooting up again. On Friday it cracked 2.5%, and Monday morning it's cracking 2.59%. That's the highest level since August, 2011. From Bloomberg: Bloomberg Meanwhile, this comes as China is crashing, and markets are generally down.
REUTERS/Aly SongPeople look at an electronic board at a Shanghai brokerage house.A few weeks ago all the talk was about Japan. Now the focus turns to China. Last week we saw a surge in short-term interbank lending rates spark fears of a credit crisis. Today: market crash. The Shanghai Composite fell 5.3%, as the saddest index in the world continues to plummet. A big contributor to this was a message from the People's Bank of China telling banks that their liquidity issues were their own problem, and that they needed to sort them out. Elsewhere in Asia, the Nikkei, which had opened up 1.4%, ended down 1.36%. Meanwhile in Europe, Italy is down 0.7%. U.S. futures are red. Also, interest rates on the U.S. 10-year are up to 2.59%. That at the Chinese decline will be today's big story. For more on the latest from the People's Bank of China, see here.
