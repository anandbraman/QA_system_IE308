APEst√©e Lauder and her husband Jo in 1972.This past Wednesday, philanthropist and cosmetics tycoon Leonard Lauder donated a cubist art collection worth $1 billion to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. That may seem extravagant, but Lauder can afford it ‚Äî Forbes estimates he's worth $8.1 billion, due mainly to the cosmetics empire founded by his mother, the late Est√©e Lauder. Her shrewd sales tactics and corporate strategy have kept the Lauders on top for over seven decades. Est√©e Lauder pioneered giving out product samples to women, encouraged them to try her scents at the department store counters, and undercut her competitors with cheaper prices and better marketing. Today, the Est√©e Lauder empire now owns 29 other big-name brands and reported sales of just over $9.7 billion to investors last year. And how the Lauders spend all that money is almost as interesting as the rags-to-riches story of how the daughter of two Hungarian Jewish immigrants left behind a beauty dynasty.

Jeff Saut Reveals The Great Secret To Investing (Advisor Perspectives) When Jeff Saut was young, his father told him that people learn "The Great Secret" when they're dying. As he grew older, Saut writes that he realized life is a "series of great secrets". One of those secrets is figuring out how to make money grow. That's why people become investors in the stock market. To learn "The Great Secret‚Äù about how to make money on Wall Street." Looking back to post World War II common wisdom was that bonds were the better asset in the long term. But in the decade that followed inflation averaged about 4% per annum while large capitalization stocks returned 16.7% per year, long-term corporate bonds 1.8% per year, and long-dated government bonds about 1.3% per year." But portfolio's continued to center on bonds for another decade before people began to seriously consider investing in stocks. Everyone dived into stocks in the mid-60s until 1968 when the Dow peaked and a long-term bear market began. With that in mind, Saut writes, "In the stock market 'The Great Secret' is when you see the crowd in the rear-view mirror, go contrary to the crowd, and then wait for the great Humble daring to think differently."  How Firms Can Retain Clients When Advisors Want To Ditch Them (The Wall Street Journal) As advisors grow, they become more selective in their choice of clients. They focus on a clients in a certain line of work, or move on to wealthier clients. But firms don't want to lose the clients. This transition is tricky.¬† Scott Mahoney at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management told the Wall Street Journal that they moves clients to different programs, and some even have "pre-approved letters" that let clients know their accounts will be handled by a new advisor. The letter could for instance say something along these lines: "During a recent review of my client database, I realized that we have not spoken in quite some time. I would like to recommend you to someone who I feel can provide you with the level of service I feel you deserve."   Tom Lee Admits His Stock Market Call Was Wrong (JP Morgan) JP Morgan's Tom Lee first took on a short term bearish tone with the stock market in January. And the following month he essentially said he was looking for a stock market sell-off. But stocks hit all-time highs in the first quarter, and Lee now he admits he was wrong. "We capitulate on our 'correction' call," he wrote in a note to clients. "A stronger bull market (than anticipated) is underway in 2013, tracking more closely with a typical 5th year than we anticipated (average 5th year gain is 19%, implying 1700 by year-end). "What went wrong with our call over the past 6 weeks, in our view, is two-fold: first, economic data, while softening, did not weaken as anticipated and more importantly, markets looked through this (the March jobs report was the final example for us) and second, the market has worked off 'contrarian sell' signals (HF beta, MF beta, AAII, etc.) without correction (digesting rather than correcting)." The Incredible Rise And Unprecedented Decline Of Gold ETFs (Business Insider) Gold entered bear market territory today.¬† But gold ETFs have seen outflows in recent weeks and analysts had warned that this is a huge negative for the commodity. Bloomberg, Business Insider Howard Marks Thinks 'Risk Consciousness' Is The Most Dangerous Thing To Neglect (Beyond Proxy)  Howard Marks told John Mihaljevic at Beyond Proxy that "risk consciousness" is the most dangerous thing to neglect.¬† "I think it is risk consciousness. I think that the great accomplishment in investing is not making a lot of money, but is making a lot of money with less-than-commensurate risk. So you have to understand risk and be very conscious of it and control it and know it when you see it. "The people that I think are great investors are really characterized by exceptionally low levels of loss and infrequency of bad years. That is one of the reasons why we have to think of great investing in terms of a long time span. Short-term performance is an imposter. The investment business is full of people who got famous for being right once in a row. If you read Fooled by Randomness by [Nassim] Taleb, you understand that being right once proves nothing. You can be right once through nothing but luck."
Bloomberg TelevisionMarc FaberEveryone's talking about today's plummeting gold prices. Marc Faber, author of the the Gloom Boom &amp; Doom Report, was on Bloomberg TV with Trish Regan and Adam Johnson to talk about it. Faber is an optimist.¬† He thinks this sell-off is presenting a buying opportunity. He also thinks we should think of gold relative to the other asset classes.  "I would just like to make one comment," he said.¬† "At the moment, a lot of people are knocking gold down. But if we look at the records, we are now down 21% from the September 2011 high. Apple is down 39% from last year's high." For what it's worth. Watch the whole interview on Bloomberg.com.¬† Here's more of the transcript courtesy of Bloomberg TV: Faber on the fall in gold prices: "I love the markets. I love the fact that gold is finally breaking down. That will offer an excellent buying opportunity. I would just like to make one comment. At the moment, a lot of people are knocking gold down. But if we look at the records, we are now down 21% from the September 2011 high. Apple is down 39% from last year's high. At the same time, the S&amp;P is at about not even up 1% from the peak in October 2007. Over the same period of time, even after today's correction gold is up 100%. The S&amp;P is up 2% over the March 2000 high. Gold is up 442%. So I am happy we have a sell-off that will lead to a major low. It could be at $1400, it could be today at $1300, but I think that the bull market in gold is not completed." "$1300. Nobody knows for sure but I think the fundamentals for gold are still intact. I would like to make one additional comment. Today we have commodities breaking down including gold. At the same time we have bonds rallying very strongly. If you stand aside and you look at these two events, it would suggest that they are strongly deflationary pressures in the system. If that was the case, I wouldn't buy stocks or sovereign bonds because the stock market would be hit by disappointing profits if there was a deflationary environment." On gold falling lower if we have a deflationary environment "Yes, I agree. That's why I said if the gold market collapse is saying something about deflation and at the same time we have this sharp rise in bond prices and the signals are correct that we have deflation, I wouldn't buy stocks because in a deflationary environment, corporate profits will disappoint very badly." On whether a deflationary environment is possible right now: "Everything is possible‚Ä¶In the economy of the cuckoo people that populate central banks, everything is possible. What you have is gigantic bubbles, the NASDAQ in 2000, then the housing bubble and then commodities in 2008 when oil went from $78 to $147 before plunging to $32 within sixth months. That kind of volatility comes from expansionary monetary policies from money-printing." "All I'm saying is that I think we're going to have a major low in gold in within the next couple of weeks. Gold, as of today, you should actually buy as a trade. I think it can rebound in the next two days by $40." On why gold will rebound $40 in the next two days: "Because we are about in gold as oversold and we were essentially during the crash in 1987. From there we have a strong rebound. All I am saying as a trader I would probably enter the market quickly for a rebound of $20 or $40. From a longer term perspective, I would give it some time. We may go lower. I am not worried. I am happy gold is finally coming down, which will provide a very good entry point." On whether investors should also stay in cash: "My argument is that you should always have in this kind of high volatility environment a fair amount of cash because opportunities will always arise again and again and if you have cash you can then buy assets at a reasonable price. I think Patience is very important in this environment. The question is, how do you hold your cash? Hopefully not with a Cyprus bank."
Jan Hatzius of Goldman Sachs had some interesting commentary on the deficit the other day. †Youíll recognize the sectoral balances chart in his work as heís one of the few analysts on Wall Street who seems to really appreciate the importance of Wynne Godleyís work. Here, he describes the 3 reasons why the deficit is about to slide in the coming years: ìThere are three main reasons for the sharp reduction in the deficit: 1. Lower spending. On a 12-month average basis, federal outlays have fallen by a total of 4% in the past two years, the first decline in nominal dollar terms over a†comparable period since the demobilization from the Korean War in the mid-1950s. 2. Higher tax rates. The increase in payroll tax rates in January 2013 has boosted federal receipts by around $120 billion (annualized), or about 0.8% of GDP. 3. Economic improvement. Although real GDP has only grown at a sluggish 2%-2.5% pace since the end of the 2007-2009 recession, this has been enough to†generate a sizable improvement in tax receipts, over and above the more recent impact of higher tax rates. Even prior to the tax hike that took effect in early 2013, total†federal receipts had grown by 7% (annualized) from the 2009 bottom, nearly twice the growth rate of nominal GDP. We expect the deficit to continue to decline and are forecasting a deficit of 3% of GDP or less in fiscal 2015. Some of this is policy-related. Sequestration has barely†started to show up in the outlay data, and the expiration of the Bush tax cuts for high income earners in 2013 is likely to reduce tax refunds and boost final settlements†in early 2014. In addition, the two parties are calling for further spending cuts and/or tax increases (although it is unclear whether these will be enacted). But the more important reason, in our view, is that there is still a great deal of room for the economic recovery to reduce the deficit for cyclical reasons. The key to this†forecast is our expectation that the private sector financial surplusñthe difference between the total income and total spending of all households and businessesñwill†decline substantially further from the 5.5% of GDP reading of the fourth quarter of 2012 toward the historical average of 2% of GDP. As a matter of accounting, this reduction must be mirrored in a drop in the federal deficit, a drop in the state and local deficit, an increase in the current account deficit,†or a combination of all three. In practice, however, we expect it to translate primarily into a decline in the federal deficit, as tax receipts rise and outlays decline (e.g. via†reductions in the unemployment rolls.) This expectation is consistent with the historical record. As shown in Exhibit 2, there has been a close inverse relationship†between the private sector balance and the federal government balance in recent decades, with a correlation in annual data of -0.72. Goldman Sachs And the conclusion from Hatzius: ìIn our view, the most important implication from the reduction in the budget deficit for the near-term economic outlook is reduced pressure for further fiscal†retrenchment. Partly for this reason, we expect the drag from fiscal policy on real GDP growth to decline sharply from around 2% of GDP in 2013 to around 0.5% in†coming years. This is a key reason for our expectation that real GDP growth will accelerate from around 2% (annualized) in Q2/Q3 2013 to 3%-3.5% in 2014-2016.î Iíd only add that itís important that the private sectorís de-leveraging is slowing and even turning into a re-leveraging to some degree. †This means the private sector is healthier than most presume and that the government deficit isnít needed to power private growth as much as it has been in the last few years. †This passing of the baton is important in understanding the future trajectory of the economy. †The decline in the deficit is as much as a result of mild government austerity as it is a sign of increased private sector health.
Bloomberg TelevisionJeremy Grantham One icy morning in February, a train pulled into Washington DC. It was loaded with environmentalists planning to handcuff themselves to the gates of the White House, in protest at the building of a 3,500km oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. Amid the hundreds of placard-carrying protesters stood a somewhat incongruous figure in a suit ñ Jeremy Grantham, a 74-year-old fund manager. "What we are trying to do is buy time," he told reporters. "Buy time for the world to wake up." Grantham ñ who occupies a legendary place in the world of finance for predicting all the major stock market bubbles of recent decades (and doing very well in the process) ñ had decided, after 15 years of low-key environmental philanthropy, to, as he puts it, "walk the walk". "I was committed to getting arrested," says Grantham, a tall, slight man, as he looks out across the City from his London office on the 15th floor of a glass-and-steel tower next to the Bank of England. He speaks machine gun-quickly in a soft, mid-Atlantic accent. "But the day before [the protest] my wife checked with the lawyer, who said, 'Don't do that!'" It turned out that being arrested would give him serious problems when it came to travelling. "I've had a green card since completing my MBA at Harvard in 1964." Grantham, co-founder and chief strategist of GMO, a Boston-based global investment group, manages $106bn (£69bn) of assets on behalf of 1,000 institutional investors, and employs 600 people, so he decided that the fallout would be too great. He was forced to stand back and watch as his daughter Isabel got arrested, alongside the actor Daryl Hannah, the US's highest-profile environmentalist Bill McKibben, and Nasa climate scientist James Hansen. So he is speaking out instead. From where he stands, this bubble, the "carbon bubble", is the biggest he's seen. "We're already in a bad place. The worst accidents are [only] 20, 30, 40 years from now." Such apocalyptic talk is often the preserve of deep-green doom-mongers ñ the kind of talk that has led many to reject environmentalism. But Grantham insists he's guided "by the facts alone". On some issues (immigration and education) he "would be considered rightwing", but with the environment, he says he calls it as he sees it. He is disdainful of those who ignore the data, or worse, misinform the public. "I find the parallels between how some investors refuse to recognise trends, and our reaction to some of our environmental challenges, very powerful," he says. "There is an unwillingness to process unpleasant data. In a bull market you want to believe good news. You don't want to hear that the market is going to go off a cliff." He finds climate sceptics ñ led by a "little army of non-scientific, persuasive loony lords", as he characterises them (a barely disguised reference to the former Conservative chancellor Lord Lawson and Ukip's Lord Monckton, both of whom promote, to varying degrees, climate-sceptic views) ñ a frustrating ideological phenomenon. "They have profound beliefs ñ as opposed to knowledge ñ that they are willing to protect by all manner of psychological tricks. So you have people who are very smart ñ great analysts and hedge-fund managers ñ who on paper know that their argument is wrong, but who promote it fiercely because they are libertarians. Anyone with a brain knows that climate change needs governmental leadership, and they can smell this is bad news for their philosophy. They are using incredible ingenuity to steer their way around facts they do not choose to accept." Grantham, who was born in Doncaster and raised a Quaker, freely admits to being a "late arrival to all this". After completing a degree in economics at the University of Sheffield in the early 1960s, he worked for a short stint at Shell before going to Harvard for an MBA. In 1977, he co-founded GMO [Grantham, Mayo, Van Otterloo]. Making his clients ñ and himself ñ wealthy filled his working days until the mid-1990s. And then he went on holiday with his children, to the Amazon. "And without thinking about it, you start talking about the logs along the side of the river and the lack of mature forests in Borneo." He smiles, seeing the risk of being accused of being driven by emotion rather than rigorous statistical analysis. "That played a role, but we didn't treat it as an epiphany." And he didn't preach. For years he has remained, Oz-like, behind the curtain of the environmental movement. He has shunned in-depth interviews and expressed his views only in quarterly newsletters published on GMO's website, where he writes of long-term risk, climate change and dwindling resources ñ not just oil, coal and natural gas, but also phosphorus and potash, whose use in modern farming methods "must be drastically reduced in the next 20ñ40 years or we will begin to starve". At the same time, he has poured an ever-larger amount of his personal wealth into his Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment, which he runs, with family input (his children are trustees) and minimal staff, out of GMO's Boston headquarters. The foundation's latest tax filing shows that in 2011 he increased the fund's coffers by $46m (£30m), bringing the total to something approaching $400m (£260m), up from $106m in 2006. Ever the wise moneyman, he has largely reinvested this money, in order to guarantee the foundation's long-term security. But he also spends around $17m annually on his chosen causes, in the process becoming, according to one magazine, the "world's most powerful environmentalist". Run your finger down the tax document and you see why. In 2011 alone, his foundation gave $1m to each of the leading US conservation charities, the Sierra Club and Nature Conservancy, as well as $2m to the Environmental Defense Fund, where his German-born wife Hannelore is a trustee and where Isabel has also worked. He is perhaps best known in the green world for funding the London School of Economics' Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment ($2.2m in 2011), and Imperial College London's Grantham Institute for Climate Change ($1.9m in 2011), but he funds climate researchers in India, too. He has written large cheques for the Carnegie Institute of Science, the Smithsonian, 350.org, WWF, Greenpeace and, keen to counter what he calls the "misinformation machine", funds environmental journalism at National Public Radio, the Center for Investigative Journalism, grist.org, Media Matters and the Yale Forum on Climate Change &amp; the Media. Until last year (when he decided investigative and environmental journalism was "dying out" due to cutbacks), he funded the world's most lucrative journalism award, the annual $80,000 Grantham prize for environmental reporting. In the past few months, however, there has been a conspicuous gear-shift in his activities. In addition to being more outspoken, he intends to support new research initiatives, particularly into "avant garde, sustainable" farming techniques. He talks of a "hybrid" form of farming that takes the best of organic farming and the best from "Big Ag". He doesn't rule out "compromises" such as genetic modification, which some environmentalists will find hard to swallow. Having said that, his interest isn't entirely selfless. "Fifteen years ago, we started a forestry division [at GMO] because I had fallen in love with land and trees, and because I realised it was a mispriced asset class. We have done extremely well in that sector, outperforming the benchmark for 15 years." Many deep-greens ñ who claim the root cause for our environmental woes is the slavish quest for economic growth ñ will recoil at the thought of a hard-boiled capitalist such as Grantham underpinning so much of the environmental movement. He is unconcerned. "Capitalism does millions of things better than the alternatives. It balances supply and demand in an elegant way that central planning has never come close to. However, it is totally ill-equipped to deal with a small handful of issues. Unfortunately, they are the issues that are absolutely central to our long-term wellbeing and even survival." More awkwardly, he insists his substantial investments in oil and gas don't contradict his green views. "We need oil. If we took oil away tomorrow, civilisation ends. We can burn all the cheap, high-quality oil and gas, but if we mean to burn all the coal and any appreciable percentage of the tar sands, or even third-derivative, energy-intensive oil and gas, with 'fracking' for shale gas on the boundary, then we're cooked, we're done for." He does think there's some cause for hope. For example, "the business mathematics of alternative energy are changing much faster [than many people] realise." Looming carbon taxes ("hopefully, in the not-too-distant future"), coupled with the increasing affordability of alternative energy, will mean that coal and oil from tar sands run the "very substantial risk of being stranded assets". There there's the "amazing" fall in fertility rates across the world ("the absolute minimum hope of survival is a gracefully declining population"). But "China is my secret weapon," he says enthusiastically. His eyes widen with excitement, and he talks quicker and quicker. "The Chinese cavalry riding to the rescue. I have very high hopes for China because they have embedded high scientific capabilities in their leadership class. They know this is serious. And they are acting much faster now than we are. They have it within their capabilities to come back in 30 years with the guarantee of complete energy independence ñ all alternative and sustainable for ever. They have an embarrassment of capital. We have an embarrassment of debt. So they can set a stunning pace, which they are doing. And they could crank it up. To hell with their five-year plans, they should move up to 25-year plans. They would have such low-cost energy at the end of it they'd be the terror of the capitalist system. Low energy and low labour, that's the ball game." But he argues that there is no reason why the west can't compete. "Anyone who says government can't do this, or can't do that, I say a pox on you; have a look at the Manhattan Project. They did remarkable things. They stuck the brightest minds out in the desert. They were herding cats with great egos, but it worked. If we did that on alternative energy, we'd be home free."

Screenshot via Bloomberg TVLegendary investor Howard Marks of Oaktree Capital Management thinks value investors need to pay attention to the macro environment. In an interview with John Mihaljevic of Beyond Proxy, Marks said that value investors need to do more than just identify a stock that is cheap but has intrinsic value. That is just "hubristic". From Beyond Proxy: ìIf you are a value investor and you invest whenever you find a stock which is selling for one-third less than your estimate of intrinsic value, and you say, I donít care about the macro, nor what I call the temperature of the market, then you are acting as if the world is always the same and the desirability of making investments is always the same. But the world changes radically, and sometimes the investing world is highly hospitable (when the prices are depressed) and sometimes it is very hostile (when prices are elevated). ìI guess what you are saying is we just look at the micro; we look at them one stock at a time; we buy them whenever they are cheap. I canít argue with that. On the other hand, it is much easier to make money when the world is depressed, because when it stops being depressed, itís like a compressed spring that comes back. "ÖI think it is unrealistic and maybe hubristic to say, ëI donít care about what is going on in the world. I know a cheap stock when I see one.í If you donít follow the pendulum and understand the cycle, then that implies that you always invest as much money as aggressively. That doesnít make any sense to me. I have been around too long to think that a good investment is always equally good all the time regardless of the climate." Marks said it is important for investors to not just be "aggressive" but†sometimes, "play defense" too. Watch the entire interview at Beyond Proxy:

Gold has erased 5 percent of its value today. It just took another big leg down after getting hit several times this morning and trading sideways for most of the afternoon. However, it's just come into some renewed selling pressure late in the day, and is now trading around $1487 (it started the day around $1560). Technically, gold is now in a bear market thanks to today's massive decline. ThinkorswimClick to enlarge
Bloomberg TelevisionJP Morgan's Tom LeeBack in January, JP Morgan's famous bull Tom Lee turned heads when he took a surprisingly bearish tone on the stock market. That was followed by a February 22 note titled "Stepping Aside Short-Term; Fade Strength and Look for Better Entry Point Around 1400-1450; Big Picture Constructive."† In other words, he was looking for a stock market sell-off. That sell-off never came.† Instead, stocks rallied and established all-time highs.† And today Lee's admitting defeat. "We capitulate on our 'correction' call," he wrote in a note to clients. "A stronger bull market (than anticipated) is underway in 2013, tracking more closely with a typical 5th year than we anticipated (average 5th year gain is 19%, implying 1700 by year-end).

Oh well. To be clear, that was just a short-term call.† This whole time, Lee has maintained a 1,580 year-end target for the S&amp;P 500. Also, it's worth noting that Lee was the most accurate strategist on Wall Street in 2012.
ImdbThis is not said man.A German man was arrested at Athens International Airport after allegedly attempting to smuggle half a ton of gold and silver out of Greece, the BBC reports. The man was trying to board a Lufthansa flight back to Germany when the¬†airline uncovered nearly 1,000 lbs. of¬†what the BBC calls silver "tablets" in a cargo container.  Customs officials subsequently found 15 lbs. of gold and about $400,000 in banknotes. It's an ironic development given Greece has long demanded further reparations from Germany over damages sustained during World War II.¬† This week, reports emerged that Greece will soon demand $261 billion in compensation, including sums taken from the Bank of Greece by German forces, the BBC says.

AP The U.S. Treasury has announced the names of 18 Russian citizens who will have sanctions imposed on them under the Magnitsky Act. According to the wording of the act, the people listed are "persons responsible for the detention, abuse, or death of Sergei Magnitsky, for the conspiracy to defraud the Russian Federation of taxes on corporate profits through fraudulent transactions and lawsuits against Hermitage, and for other gross violations of human rights in the Russian Federation, and for other purposes." Magnitsky was a Moscow-based lawyer for investment fund, Hermitage Capital, who became notorious after allegedly uncovering massive tax fraud. He died under suspicious circumstances while serving jail time in 2009. Those on the list will face visa bans and have assets frozen under the law. The list has been widely referred to as a "blacklist". Vladimir Putin's Russian government had repeatedly warned that the list would damage relations. There has even been talk of a blacklist of US officials with links to†Guantanamo Bay in response. However, the list is far shorter than the Kremlin may have feared, and does not include some of the big names that had reportedly been targeted. There had been speculation that Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov would be on the list, but his name does not appear, and no-one close to Putin was named. Josh Rogin at Foreign Policy points out that 16 of the names relate directly to the Magnitsky case. Two of the names ó Letscha Bogatirov and Kazbek Dukuzov ó are Chechen police officers who have been linked to human rights abuses. The names are as follows:
Bank of America Merrill LynchThe gold price sell-off is getting downright ugly. Down 4% today, gold is now 20% from its September 2011 high, which means it's in a bear market. We've heard some ultra-bulls say with a straight face that gold was heading for the stratosphere.¬† For whatever reason, they argued that it could be worth multiples of where it is today.¬† We've heard targets from $5,000 to $10,000. There was even a rationale for gold at $46,000/Oz. With prices plummeting, we thought it would be a good time to revisit some of the wildest gold price targets we've heard in the last year.
YahooThe biggest problem with Apple's iPhone 5 is the battery. Yes, the battery lasts for a long time if you don't actually use your iPhone. But given that the whole reason to have an iPhone is to use it, having to not use it is a bummer. Normally, I only have to be away from a power outlet for an hour or two at a time. So, although I experience considerable anxiety as I watch the battery steadily drain away while I'm out and about, I usually make it to an outlet with plenty of time to spare. (This is easy when my destination is the office or home. If I'm out in the wild, though, I have to ransack any building or meeting room or restaurant I go into for a socket. And then shamelessly stuff my charger into it.) A couple of weeks ago, though, I had to navigate around a foreign city checking out museums and riding buses and subways all day. This meant that I not only needed to use my iPhone (Google Maps!), I had to figure out a way to make the battery last 12 hours. This was a harrowing experience. The first day, I failed, and my iPhone conked out just when I needed it the most. But then, necessity being the mother of invention, I experimented. And, eventually, I figured out some simple tricks that allowed me to nurse my iPhone through a whole day. In case you should ever happen to find yourself in a similar situation, here are those tricks. I'll show you how to do them below. 1. Turn off "auto-brightness" on your screen and turn the brightness of your screen down to where you can barely see it.¬†That screen is a major battery hog. If you want your battery to last, you need to use it as little as possible, and you need to turn it down so far that it is hard to see when you do use it. Yes, this defeats the purpose of having a bright, sharp screen. But it is what it is. 2. Turn your screen off the instant you finish looking at it. If you're like me, you had no idea you could easily turn your phone's screen off. But you can! All you have to do is quickly click the button on the top of your phone that (if held down for a couple of seconds) turns your phone on and off. If you click it quickly, your screen will turn off! Then just click it quickly again to turn the screen back on. Importantly, this does NOT turn your whole phone off. Just the screen. I was astounded when I discovered this trick. So simple and handy. 3. Turn off all your apps the instant you finish using them. If you're like me, you spent your first four years of iPhone ownership not knowing that you could turn apps off when they seized up or stopped working (or when they drained your battery). But you can! And it's not too hard to do. It's also critical to do it if you want to get through the day, especially if you're using a "maps" app like Google Maps. If left to its own devices, Google Maps might suck your battery dry all by itself in an hour. So you have to turn that thing off. And while you're doing it, you might as well turn off some other apps, too. (UPDATE: I have heard from some iPhone aficionados who say that keeping apps on "in the background" shouldn't drain the battery. Other iPhone aficionados, however, dispute this, saying that it depends on the app. Until I get an official answer, when I'm trying to conserve battery life, I'll turn 'em off.) Now, there are some other truly emergency measures you can take if you need your phone to last, say, a whole weekend (like when you forget the only charge cord in the house that, because of Apple's cord-switcheroo, will charge an iPhone 5 ... which I do every other weekend). Basically, in those cases, you're going to have to use your iPhone only in short bursts and then turn it completely off for hours. But hopefully you won't ever find yourself in that¬†situation. Hopefully, you'll just occasionally need to spend a day away from a power outlet and, therefore, need to employ the basic conservation measures above. Here's a pictorial tutorial on how to do that. HOW TO TURN AUTO-BRIGHTNESS OFF AND YOUR BRIGHTNESS DOWN First, click on your phone's general "Settings" app. (The gray app icon with the gears on the front that came installed on your phone). You will see the screen below. Now click the "Brightness &amp; Wallpaper" section (red arrow). Henry Blodget / Business Insider When you see the screen below, do two things: 1) Turn "Auto-Brightness" OFF. If you don't do this, your screen will keep getting super-bright in outside light, demolishing your battery. 2) Turn your "Brightness" down by moving the slider to the left. This will be a painful and depressing thing to do, because your beautiful screen will get dim and hard to read. But better hard to read than dead. (And you can always turn it up momentarily if you're having a really tough time.)  Henry Blodget / Business InsiderHOW TO TURN YOUR iPHONE SCREEN OFF This is remarkably easy. Just click the the on/off button on the top of the phone (see below). Don't hold it down (that will turn your phone off.) Just click it. And when you want to use the phone, click it again. Jay Yarow/Business Insider HOW TO TURN YOUR APPS OFF This one's trickier. But it will pay huge dividends in protecting your battery life. First, click the HOME button on your iPhone twice in succession (The HOME button is the round physical button at the bottom of your phone when you're holding it upright.)¬† This should produce a screen that looks like this: Henry Blodget / Business Insider The apps at the bottom of that screen are the ones that are "running." Sometimes, if you're like me, you'll have a dozen or more apps running. Some of those babies are sucking on your battery even when you don't think you're using them. So let's turn them off! To turn off the apps, first put your finger on any app icon and hold it down. (Don't tap it. That will cause it to open. Just put your finger on it and hold.) Henry Blodget / Business Insider That should produce a screen that looks like this. Your app icons will now be jiggling. And they will have a little red circle with a line through them in the upper left corner. Now, tap the red circle of every app you want to close. I'll close TweetDeck. Henry Blodget / Business Insider Voil√†! It's closed! (And gone.) Henry Blodget / Business Insider Close as many apps as you can. And absolutely close your map app the instant you finish using it. That thing will kill you. So those are some simple tricks that should help you get your iPhone through the day. Now, we just have to persuade Apple to build a phone with a bigger battery!
It's been a rough day for gold. Right now, it's down about 4.1%, hovering right at the $1500 level. Earlier, it sank below $1500 per ounce for the first time since July 2011. After today's big sell-off, gold is officially in bear market territory (a bear market is typically defined as a 20% drop from the highest level of the cycle). Gold topped out at $1900.20 on September 5, 2011. The $1520 level represents a 20% decline from that peak, and the market already smashed through that to the downside earlier this morning.

Josh Hallet via FlickrDisney confirmed rumors this week that it would be laying off staff in a move to streamline its businesses.†† Mouse House cut 150 positions from several film studio divisions, nearly 2 percent of the division's 7,000 overall jobs, according to Bloomberg. Disney's studio department is made up of†theatrical distribution, home entertainment, and television. Disney announced the cuts as "part of an ongoing review to ensure that the Studiosí operational structure and economics align with the demands of the current marketplace" in a spokesperson statement.†† Last week, cuts were reported to be part of an internal audit ordered by Disney CEO and Chairman Bob Iger. The layoffs were the second round Disney made in a week after closing Lucasfilm's video game division, LucasArts, and laying off 150 staff members.† Disney acquired Lucasfilm last December in a $4 billion deal. Business Insider caught up with Jeff Gomez, CEO of Starlight Runner Entertainment, to discuss the most recent layoffs and those at LucasArts.† Starlight Runner closely tracks projects at all of the major studios. Gomez has worked on Disney's "Pirates of the Caribbean" and has served as a brand extension consultant to the company. Here's what's going on at the Mouse House:† Home theatrical sales are down Youtube/OnlyOneMovieCindA "Cinderella" re-release didn't go over well with consumers.During Disney's Q1 earning's call in February, Iger acknowledged an operating income decline in the home entertainment and theatrical businesses due to the poor retail performances of "Brave" and a re-release of "Cinderella."† "Home entertainment results faced a difficult comparison given the releases of 'Cars 2' and 'The Lion King' last year compared to 'Brave' and 'Cinderella' this year. While theatrical revenue was higher in the quarter due to the release of 'Wreck-It Ralph,' 'Lincoln' and 'Frankenweenie,' operating income declined as a result of higher distribution and film amortization costs compared to prior year."† Disney's most recent 10K SEC filing expands on this more: Lower home entertainment revenue reflected a 23% decrease from a decline in unit sales and an 8% decrease from lower net effective pricing including the impact of a higher current-quarter sales mix of catalog titles, which have a lower sales price than new releases. Significant titles in the current year included†Brave, Cinderella†Diamond Release and Marvel's†The Avengers ... As a result, Gomez says†the latest round of layoffs at the studio make a lot of sense.†† "Our mass conversion to a digital and cloud-based society is picking up steam and impacting DVD / Blu-Ray, consumer products and distribution to say the least," says Gomez. "It makes sense to move people around as a result, or to even cut staff. We last saw this at the studios not long after DVD sales peaked earlier last decade." Moving away from in-house studio films† Marvel screencapAnother factor that has affected the studio is Disney's reduced reliance on distributing less films through its own studio.†† Last September, Disney took a reported $50 million write-down on a stop-motion animation project set to debut fall 2013.† During 2012's Q4 earnings call last November, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Executive Vice President James A. Rasulo mentioned the cancellation of the film, "Cinderbiter," was responsible for 98 percent of the write-downs Q4 2012. Instead the Mouse House turns to its big three acquisitions ó†Pixar, Marvel, and, now Lucasfilm ó to deliver hits. "With Pixar, Lucasfilm and Marvel, more of Disney's key product is being developed off the studio lot and with greater autonomy," says Gomez. "This taxes the studio proper less than in the past, but pulls the focus to some of Disney's greatest strengths: marketing and distribution, consumer products, and theme parks. You can expect these divisions to be bolstered in the coming months." This year, the company will release a total of ten films. Its big hits for the year include Marvel's "Iron Man III," "Thor: The Dark World," and Pixar's "Monsters University." Four months into the year, the company has only released one movie, "Oz the Great and Powerful," with plans to release ten this year. There was a time the Mouse House was putting out triple that number of films in 2000. Last year, Disney released 18 movies. Laying off LucasArts staff Getty ImagesDisney acquired both Lucasfilm and LucasArts at the end of last year in a $4 billion deal.Gomez says the decision to rid of Lucasfilm's gaming division most likely had to do with the LucasArt's distribution record.† "Although†LucasArts†have made some great games over the years, the division's record for hits was inconsistent, which was something Disney was already familiar with," says Gomez. Plus the Mouse House doesn't need another video game division that may deliver flops.  The segment posted losses for 19-consecutive quarters.†Despite posting its†first profits in Q1 2013, Interactive is still Disney's least profitable division. Gomez adds it's highly unlikely that the LucasArts cancelled game "Star Wars 1313," which was rumored to revolve around bounty hunter Boba Fett, fell in line with Disney's line of family-friendly material. "Major projects in production like the 'Star Wars 1313' game may have been significantly afield tonally (e.g., much darker) from the kinds of films and television shows now being planned for the franchise. Fortunately we're seeing indications that some of the great talent from that division will be finding their way into movie production at Lucasfilm." Later this year, Disney is hoping for a big hit from its video game department with the release of an interactive game, "Disney Infinity," something Iger hinted can be a make or break for the Interactive division in February. "The biggest swing factor for the year, as I said in my remarks, is 'Infinity,'" said Iger. "If 'Infinity' does well, it bodes very well for the bottom line for this unit. If it doesn't do well, the opposite will be the case." The game's release date has already been pushed back from June to August of this year.
Portuguese Ministry of FinancePortugal has again moved to the forefront of the European debt crisis after its constitutional court rejected struck down parts of the country's 2013 budget.¬† According to Nomura's Alastair Newton, this amounts to 20 percent of Portugal's austerity plan. This austerity was part of a bailout deal the country agreed to two years ago. Click here to jump straight to the presentation &gt;  Portugal, which has been undertaking comprehensive labor market reform, is still far from being back on track. According to The Economist, Portugal has arguably been the "most devout in repentance."¬† However, the country is seeing increasing austerity protests. In a presentation titled "Adjusting in the euro area: The case of Portugal" Portuguese finance minister Vitor Gaspar¬†walks us through Portugal's economic crisis. "Considering the events of 2008-2010 as a simple demand-driven business-cycle fluctuation was an error of judgment that proved to be expensive in the context of the euro area sovereign debt crisis," wrote Gaspar. In addition to identifying errors, he also looks at the aftermath of the crisis and what the economy needs to do to return to¬† growth and job creation.
offbeatchina.com China's new money rich kids are getting more and more outrageous ó and creating more and more of a backlash online. The latest scandal started earlier this month after reports of a "sexy party" at the Hainan Rendez-Vous Lifestyle and Yacht Show in the coastal resort of Sansa. Shanghai Daily reported on the sordid details of the party, including allegations that one model earned 600,000 yuan ($97,000) from the sex parties, and that more than 2,000 condoms were used over 3 days. Local government officials are now investigating the reports.† The scandal escalated as members of a luxury group called the†Sports Car Club (SCC)†accused notorious a 20-year-old socialite, Guo Meimei, of offering sex for money at the party. Guo had previously set off a controversy for flaunting her luxurious lifestyle online while claiming (falsely) to work for the†Red Cross. Guo responded with a photo of 5 million yuan ($800,000) in casino chips (as seen at the top of this post), implying she didn't need the money. It was at that point that†(rumored) SCC members responded by posting photos of their bank accounts. Here's one picture doing the rounds on Weibo: Weibo via Offbeatchina The screenshot appears to show a bank balance containing 3.7†billion†yuan ó†at current exchange rates around $597 million. According to OffBeatChina, the owner of this bank account is believed to be 19 years old. Another user responded by posting a screenshot of their own account: Weibo via Offbeatchina It's a little hard to make out, but that bank account appears to have over 9.9 billion yuan†ó†$1.5 billion. These screenshots may well be fakes, but they've certainly stirred a lot of hatred online, where they became part of the highest trending topic on Weibo. "I'm not surprised hearing something like this," one Weibo comment quoted by Shanghaiist says, "but it is really quite disgusting for a bunch of rich, bored fuerdai [second generation rich] to show-off their fancy lives like this." As new money pours into China, stories of outrageous rich kids are getting more and more prevalent. While outrage online is largely directed at the spoiled sons and daughters of newly-mminted entrepreneurs, politicians' families have faced criticism too. Notably last year†the fabulous life of Bo Xilai's playboy son was scrutinized and a tragic $1 million Ferrari crash ruined the political ambitions of the young driver's father.
">APThe big story today (and actually for awhile) is the collapse in gold, which has just fallen below $1500/oz. If you look on Twitter, or anywhere else econ types chat, there's a lot of glee over this news. Why should the decline of a relatively irrelevant commodity creating such a reaction? There's two reasons for this: The latter point is the most significant. To respond to the economic crisis, economists and mainstream policy makers have favored highly unusual policy measures (massive Fed balance sheet expansion, massive stimulus, etc.). These ideas are usually based on years of traditional economic research (Keynesianism, monetarism, etc.). All of these ideas have been slammed by heterodox types like Austrian economists, who have warned of hyperinflation, and gold going to $10,000. So the collapse in gold is not about gold, but about vindication for a large corpus of belief and economic research, which has largely panned out. It's great that our economic elites know what they're talking about, and have the tools at their disposal to address crises without creating some new catastrophe. Things aren't great in the economy, but the collapse/hyperinflation fears haven't panned out, and the decline in gold is a manifestation of that.
Instagram StarshineFINANCIAL DISTRICT ‚Äî A new shoe-shine shop in the Financial District is banking on the "ultimate" formula for cleaning up scuffed wingtips: polish, buff ‚Äî and skimpy shorts. Like the¬†Hooters¬†of the shoe-shine world,¬†Star Shine NYC, at 40 New St., employs beautiful, young, scantily clad women to offer a professional service ‚Äî with a view. Co-owner Kevin White Jr., 30, said he and his dad, who both live in Queens and work in finance, had bounced around the idea of an upscale shoe-shine spot run by attractive women for some time, and finally decided to make the move. ‚ÄúWe thought it could be a successful twist,‚Äù said White, who opened the store three weeks ago. ‚ÄúFinance guys are so busy and stressed, this is a chance to unwind and relax. It‚Äôs definitely an upgraded shoe-shine experience.‚Äù Despite the little black shorts and tight tank tops sported by all the female employees, White said the store, which features large leather chairs and flat-screen TVs, is meant to have a classy atmosphere. White also hopes to start serving beer and wine in the store in the next couple of months. ‚ÄúAll the young ladies have undergone professional training ‚Äî this is an upscale place,‚Äù White said. ‚ÄúMany of the women are students or just out of college. Even my sister, a college student, is working there.‚Äù The store's location, on a short, narrow street between Exchange Place and Beaver Street, doesn‚Äôt get lots of foot traffic, but White said word of mouth, along with the women passing out fliers on Wall Street in their uniforms, has been drumming up business. On Wednesday morning, one man, already a repeat customer, was getting his black shoes polished by 19-year-old Kaya Santiago, a¬†Westchester Community College¬†student, in the otherwise empty shop. ‚ÄúThey do a good job,‚Äù said the Wall Streeter, who asked his name not be used because his boss didn‚Äôt know he was taking an early-morning break. ‚ÄúAnd yes, it helps that they are very pretty ‚Äî but the prices are a little high if you don‚Äôt get the discount.‚Äù The regular price for a shoe shine, which takes about five minutes, is $7, though the store is offering up a $4 deal for customers who come in before 11 a.m. Star Shine is also offering its services outside of the shop. If patrons gather 10 or more people in need of a shoe shine, the girls will come to them. Plus, the women are also setting up booths at corporate events and parties. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been surprised by how many corporations have been reaching out to us,‚Äù White said. The women have already booked gigs at events for financial advisors and brokers, as well as at a software trade show at the Javits Center. As for the women, the two working Wednesday said they‚Äôve enjoyed their shoe-shine jobs so far. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs actually fun,‚Äù Santiago said. ‚ÄúEveryone‚Äôs been nice, and it's something to do while I'm in school. "And the tips can be good, usually." More from DNAinfo.com:
The 300 / YouTubeNot a fun day for commodity investors. A big part of the commodity complex is coming under heavy selling this morning, especially in energy and metals. (Gold just sank below $1500 an ounce for the first time since July 2011.) Clearly, the economic data have not been encouraging today, and the tone in the market is decidedly "risk-off" (i.e., time to sell). Here's a quick run-through of the latest damage: Soft commodities are holding up in spite of the sell-off in metals and energy. Corn is up 0.8%, wheat is 1.6% higher, and soybeans are up 0.4%.
Markets are in the red today, but the real story is how bad commodities are doing. Gold is getting crushed. Copper is getting crushed. Silver is getting crushed. This is something that trader Mark Dow has been writing a lot about, that the prospect for equities are much better than the prospect for commodities. Here's a chart (via Stockcharts.com) of the S&amp;P ETF vs. the CRB commodities index going back a couple of years. Stocks are winning big time. Paper (stocks) is crushing rock (commodities).

Gold has taken three sharp declines this morning: once around 5 AM ET, again around 8:15, and then again around 10:30. Despite¬†weaker than expected retail sales figures¬†and plummeting consumer confidence in the United States, it's down 4.5%, trading near $1494 per ounce. (Silver is also getting slammed ‚Äì it's fallen 5.4 percent this morning.) The shiny yellow metal hasn't traded below $1500 since July 2011. Meanwhile, oil is getting whacked for the second straight day. It's off 3 percent. The chart below show's this morning's action in the gold market. ThinkorswimClick to enlarge
Overshadowed by Japan's ambitious monetary policy experiment, the heightened tensions from the Korean peninsula and the nearly 1/3 increase overall cost of the Cypriot adjustment (not to mention the collapse of the Bitcon Bitcoin), China was the source of a three surprises.¬† First, Fitch became the first major rating agency to cut¬† China's local currency rating since the late 1990s.¬† The A+ rating is the lowest of the major agencies and is in line with its foreign currency rating.¬† It cited domestic debt levels and credit expansion as the impetus for its move.¬† The outlook is stable.¬†¬† One of the reasons Fitch did not cut China's foreign currency rating was due to its massive currency reserves.¬† This is the second surprise.¬† China reported its reserve rose by $128 bln in Q1, the most since Q2 2011 and nearly as much as 2012 as a whole (~$130 bln).¬† The stabilization of China's reserves had been seen as a constructive development and officials heralded as evidence that the economy was finding a new balance.¬† The new surge in China's reserves is therefore, arguably, signaling renewed tensions. It is tempting for some observers to see the growth of China's reserves to be a sign of the hot money fleeing the QE in the US and Japan, and can cite the grind higher in the yuan, which posted new 19-year highs against the dollar today.¬†  However, the story, as usual, is more complicated and that brings us to China's third surprise this week:¬† a $880 mln trade deficit instead of the $1.5.4 bln surplus the Bloomberg consensus had forecast.¬†¬† What was particularly striking about the Chinese trade figures was that exports to Hong Kong jumped 98%.¬† Exports from special economic zones rose more than 300%.¬† Exports to Taiwan rose 45, though Taiwanese figures showed a 1.2% decline in imports from China. ¬† These largely over-looked details suggest something else may be going on.¬† Hidden in these trade figures could be China's businesses financial machinations.¬† Specifically, some Chinese companies may be overstating exports to repatriate more money into China bypassing the government's controls.¬† The idea here is that the trade account may be hiding some capital account adjustments.¬†¬† Hot money had been thought to have flowed out of China after Q1 12, but in the¬† the first two months of this year, some estimates suggest the hot money returned with vengeance--to the tune of $125 bln, which does not count the funds concealed in the trade figures.¬†¬† Maybe it is the low yields and deteriorating credit quality that is encouraging Chinese companies to bring funds home.¬† Maybe expectations of yuan appreciation is behind the decision.¬†¬†¬† It most likely is not Japanese money.¬† Japanese interest in the yuan is minimal and Japanese investors have been busy repatriating money.¬† In fact, as we noted, last week Japanese investors sold, on a net basis, the most amount of foreign bonds in a year.¬† Nor are Americans the featured or marginal buyer of the yuan and Chinese assets.¬† America's current account deficit means that the US is a net importer of capital, not an exporter.¬† Moreover, when American do invest overseas they typically¬† prefer equities over fixed income and often chase returns.¬† The Chinese stock market is a an under-performer, with the Shanghai Composite off 2,75% and compared with an almost 12% rise in the S&amp;P 500 this year.¬†¬†        Read more posts on Marc to Market ¬ª
Two years ago, I tried to hack BitCoin. I failed. This was very exciting. It is a fairly open secret that almost all systems can be hacked, somehow.¬† It is a less spoken of secret that such hacking has actually gone quite mainstream.¬† Everybody hacks ‚Ä¶ sometimes.¬† But I am not here to discuss the raging question that is ‚Äî what do we do about the fact that we‚Äôve built a global economy on a system optimized for moving pictures of cats? They really are very cute. Seriously though, as an engineer and as a hacker (and I promise you, these are two very different things), BitCoin surprised me.¬† Here was a system with the following properties: By all extant metrics in security system review, this system should have failed instantaneously, at every possible layer.¬† And, to be fair, it has failed at other layers ‚Äì BitCoin thefts have occurred, in the meta-code that surrounds the core technology itself. But the core technology actually works, and has continued to work, to a degree not everyone predicted.¬†Time to enjoy being wrong.¬† What the heck is going on here? First of all, yes.¬† Money changes things.¬† A lot of the slop that permeates most software is much less likely to be present when the developer is aware that, yes, a single misplaced character really could End The World.¬† The reality of most software development is that the consequences of failure are simply nonexistent. ¬†Software tends not to kill people¬†and so we accept incredibly fast innovation loops because the consequences are tolerable and the results are astonishing. BitCoin was simply developed under a different reality.¬† The stakes weren‚Äôt obscured, and the problem wasn‚Äôt someone else‚Äôs.¬† They didn‚Äôt ignore the engineering reality, they absorbed it and innovated ridiculously. Bitcoin reflects an entirely alien design regime. (To geek out a bit, in the context of actual security paranoia, C++ is actually a great choice.¬† It allows for clean infrastructure, and if you know what you‚Äôre doing, you actually know what you‚Äôre doing.¬† Modern languages like JavaScript and Ruby are great, in that they do a huge amount for you under the surface, but then you don‚Äôt actually know what they‚Äôre going to do.¬† Ruby got burned pretty badly recently when some systems listening on the network were a little too ‚Ä¶ friendly.¬† Engineering is a game of tradeoffs.¬† So, of course, is business.) But all that was obvious two years ago, when my fifteen point list of obvious likely bugs was systematically destroyed by a codebase that quite frankly knew better.¬† What is obvious now? BitCoin is actually an exploit against network complexity.¬† Not financial networks, or computer networks, or social networks.¬† Networks themselves. To be quite specific:¬† BitCoin is a rejection of the regulation of monetary flows.¬† The cost of regulating any network actually goes up exponentially with the number of nodes that must be monitored (you need a hierarchy of systems to perform ‚Äòguard labor‚Äô to make sure systems are behaving within declared parameters). ¬† But the cost of adding yourself to the BitCoin network is not exponential.¬† Yes, the cost increases over time.¬† BitCoin has something called a Blockchain, which is a list of all transactions that have ever occurred, ever.¬† You can think of this as an account ledger, containing the content of every account, everywhere. It‚Äôs a lot of data, and it gets bigger every day, and every first class participant of BitCoin must have all of it in order for the system to work. You‚Äôre probably thinking, there‚Äôs no way that can work.¬† Eventually, that becomes too much data, and BitCoin eventually devolves into the present state of affairs with specially invested institutions forming ‚Äúthe banking community‚Äù.¬† That is what I thought, as well.¬† We are right, but we are wrong.¬† The system fails, but when?¬† Storage and bandwidth are themselves getting hilariously inexpensive.¬† You can‚Äôt just ignore time (like all those other programming languages).¬† My mistake two years ago was thinking too much like an engineer, and not enough like certain Business Insider readers. BitCoin operates in a domain that is Too Big To Regulate.¬† I predicted the number of systems monitoring Bitcoin transactions would fall ‚Äî and it did, by about 75% last time I checked.¬†  What‚Äôs important to realize is that it‚Äôs not the size of the base that matters.¬† It‚Äôs the fact that, if it was truly threatened, the cost to add more nodes ‚Äî people participating in the Bitcoin experiment ‚Äî is much lower than the cost to prevent the addition of new nodes. There‚Äôs just a deep network of ‚Äúhearts and minds‚Äù that can keep that BitCoin Ledger alive. That all being said, BitCoin has not actually won the day.¬† There have been some major thefts ‚Äì the BitFloor grab at 24,000 BTC, the Linode cloud robbery at 46,703 BTC, even the single user-steal at 25,000BTC.¬† But BitCoin‚Äôs profoundly cool design allows one to track the thieves. When $50K of BitCoins is stolen today, and is $500K of BitCoin five years from now, every last cent of that filthy lucre can be monitored with acute cryptographic precision until the end of time.¬†  And indeed, as far as I‚Äôve seen none of the stolen BitCoin have actually been spent in any way.¬† There‚Äôs actually an entire ecosystem around BitCoin ‚Äì web sites, ‚Äúmining pools‚Äù, and the like ‚Äì all of which would have to stamp their approval on a transaction involving the obviously stolen funds, none of which have seemingly been asked to.¬† And that‚Äôs interesting, because possession of stolen property is and will forever be a criminal offense, and nothing is more provably stolen than the cryptographic taint of a transaction with money from a stolen account. CONCENTRATION OF AUTHORITY? I actually have no idea what will happen when these chickens come home to roost.¬† Right now, everyone wins ‚Äì hoarding BitCoins is probably the optimum strategy even if you didn‚Äôt steal them, people who were robbed move on with their life in normal circumstances, and the ecosystem can pretend things are better now.¬† The ‚Äúofficial truth‚Äù of what money has changed hands is really in the hands of less than five or ten organizations, and that‚Äôs being generous.¬† It‚Äôs somewhat the case that if those actors really anger people, the flareup could create a sort of cryptographically enforced uprising whereby a new set of actors takes majority control of ground truth. But the power of the masses is only shrinking.¬† BitCoin made a technical choice during its initial design that allowed some people to do far more work than others, simply by having a graphical accelerator or even by designing custom hardware.¬† This is the precise capability that large financial actors and nation states have above and beyond the private sector‚Äôs capacity to produce, and it‚Äôs not obvious that even the BitCoin developers have the political ability to override a technical choice that would also harm the technology‚Äôs largest (public) players. I provide these details to make it clear ‚Äì the BitCoin experiment is not complete, there is actually quite a bit of interesting work to be done and it‚Äôs not at all clear what the future holds for the technology. ¬† Much thanks to Michael Tiffany and Ash Kalb, with whom many of these issues were discussed.
Oil is taking a beating this morning, along with other commodities like gold and silver. It's been on a steady downtrend since yesterday, but the selling has really accelerated this morning amid several U.S. economic data releases that missed economists' consensus estimates. Most notably, retail sales unexpectedly contracted in March, and consumer confidence plummeted as well. WTI crude oil futures are down 2.6 percent today, near $91.10 a barrel. "It looks like the ship is being abandoned," Addison Armstrong, director of market research at Tradition Energy, told Bloomberg's Mark Shenk. "This is the second day in which we've seen strong selling accompanied by high volume in both WTI and Brent." ThinkorswimClick to enlarge
Max Raskin of Bloomberg BusinessWeek has a killer story on Bitcoin millionaires. The best part is a hilarious, gut-wrenching lede about how one of them lost $200,000. Raskin: Many people have lost some data while reformatting a computer hard drive. Jered Kenna lost more than that. In 2010 he erased from his computer 800¬†Bitcoins that have been worth more than $200,000. Kenna isn‚Äôt upset: He has plenty more. He says he bought his first batch of virtual currency, 5,000¬†coins, at 20¬¢ each. On April¬†10, Bitcoins traded for as much as $258 each, according to Tradehill, a Bitcoin exchange in San Francisco, before plunging more than $100. Like other enthusiasts, Kenna shrugs off the volatility. While he won‚Äôt disclose his total holdings, he says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy to be considered a member of the Bitcoin millionaires‚Äô club.‚Äù More here &gt;&gt;

We've been writing quite a bit about the Bitcoin phenomenon lately, and how the value of the digital currency has been crashing lately. The reason we're talking about it is not because Bitcoin is that important (it's not) but because it's a fascinating chance to watch a mania form and dissipate in real time. Manias like this don't come around that often, and for many of the great historical ones there isn't such great real-time data. But a look at a chart going back several months is just a classic, classic bubble chart: A slow build, then a huge parabolic spike, and then in an instant: it's gone. Via ClarkMoody: Clarkmoody.com
The S&amp;P 500 closed at an all-time high yesterday. Meanwhile, market watchers continue to look for a top.¬† At the very least, people are looking for a 5% pullback or a 10% correction before the rally resumes. Earlier this morning, we got an ugly retail sales report that showed consumers unexpectedly pulled back in March.¬† Sales fell 0.4% during the month.¬† Excluding autos and gas, sales were down 0.1%. U.S. stock market futures fell sharply into the red. So, is this the top? Here's a look at Dow futures this morning. FinViz

Flickr / dfbphotosThe March reading of producer prices is out. The headline price index fell by 0.6% largely due to falling gas prices. However, this drop was much more dramatic than the 0.2% decline expected. Excluding food and energy, prices rose 0.2%, which was right in line with expectations. Year-over-year, producer prices climbed by just 1.1%. This is good news for those hoping for prolonged easy monetary policy. Last year, the Federal reserve said it would use an inflation rate threshold of 2.5% to guide monetary policy.
Bitcoin, the controversial virtual currency, is watching its market value crumble. It has fallen to $60 this morning. Just Wednesday, it topped $266 before a dramatic plunge sent it to $120. Then, Thursday, Mt. Gox ñ the world's largest Bitcoin exchange ñ†halted trading for 12 hours in an attempt to "cool down" the market. When trading reopened last night, Bitcoin instantly plunged another 35% to $78. Now, at $60, Bitcoin has lost 77% of its value from Wednesday's high. bitcoin.clarkmoody.com Mt. Gox has been dealing with trading lag issues in recent weeks as popularity of the virtual currency has soared. Some of these trading lags have been caused by "distributed denial of service" attacks, wherein hackers use large groups of computers to flood a website with bogus connections, preventing legitimate users from connecting and causing the site to crash. One analyst says hackers are doing this to force Bitcoin prices down so they can scoop them up on the cheap. The lag that sent Bitcoin traders into a selling panic on Wednesday, according to Mt. Gox, was not the result of a DDoS attack, but was instead due to the rapid influx of new users in recent days.
Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesA sign is posted in front of a Wells Fargo Bank branch in Oakland, California.Wells Fargo Q1 financial results are out. Earnings came in at $0.92 per share, which was much stronger than the $0.89 expected. However, the bank's net interest margin, which is the money it makes on deposits, was 3.48%.† Analysts were looking for 3.53%. Banks have struggled to keep their net interest margins wide in this low interest rate environment. ìWells Fargo delivered outstanding first quarter 2013 results for our shareholders,î said CEO John Stumpf. ìQuarterly earnings and EPS increased at double-digit rates compared with first quarter 2012, while loans and deposits demonstrated continued growth in a challenging economic environment. In addition, expenses continued to decline as we improved efficiency across the franchise, and returns on assets and equity increased and remained among the highest in our industry."
 REUTERS/Mario AnzuoniGood morning. Here's what you need to know.
Earnings and revenue were both stronger than expected. CEO Jamie Dimon also had some nice things to say about the economy. "We are seeing positive signs that the economy is healthy and getting stronger," he said. "Housing prices continued to improve and new home purchases are also starting to come back." But he also had some bad news: Dimon added: ìThe exception is that loan growth across the industry has been softer this quarter, although year-on-year growth remained strong. Small businesses remain cautious about the recovery and fiscal uncertainty, and are not investing their capital.†However, companiesí balance sheets are much stronger than they were before the financial crisis and small businesses remain well positioned to invest in growth once they decide to.†With approximately 2 million small business customers...î Fiscal uncertainty has been a major hindrance to growth.† Dimon had much to say about this in his annual letter to JP Morgan shareholders earlier this week. Here's an excerpt: Good public policy could create even stronger growth ñ uncertainty has become the norm. Political gridlock and the inability to craft and pass even a ìbaby bargainî (although we all would have preferred a ìgrand bargainî) have left the future fiscal situation untenable and future tax poli- cies unclear. Then you add in a debt ceiling crisis and fiscal cliff scenario ñ you get my point. Confidence, which usually is the secret sauce for the economy, for both indi- viduals and companies, gets eroded. All this is impeding our ability to grow as fast as we could and should. The solutions actually are well-known. What we need is good old-fashioned collaboration and compromise. Growth will lead to more jobs and, we hope, more prosperity for all.
Library of CongressJP Morgan's Q1 financial results are out. Earnings per share came in at $1.59, which is higher than the $1.39 analysts were looking for. Revenue came in at $25.8 billion, which was a tad higher than the $25.7 billion expected by analysts. Management also said it would crank up its dividend by 27% to $0.38 per share. From CEO Jamie Dimon: ‚ÄúWe are seeing positive signs that the economy is healthy and getting stronger. Housing prices continued to improve and new home purchases are also starting to come back. We also saw strong performance in our credit card portfolio, with net charge-offs remaining near historic lows, another sign that consumers are healthier and more confident. As a result, we reduced the allowance for loan losses in Consumer &amp; Community Banking in the first quarter by a total of $1.2 billion and are likely to see further releases. Credit conditions were also favorable across the wholesale loan portfolios.‚Äù See JP Morgan's earnings announcement at Yahoo Finance.
Flickr / SiskoDebate about the prospect of a currency war has been raging for months, and a recent pledge by the world‚Äôs 20 largest economies not to devalue their currencies has done little to calm the rhetoric. The ultra-loose monetary policies of the United States, Japan and Britain have depressed the values of the dollar, yen and sterling, angering emerging market economies whose currencies have strengthened as a result of the measures and sparking accusations of currency manipulation. But are central bankers in the major economies really down in the trenches waging war over the value of their respective currencies? Credit Suisse says no. In a recent report entitled ‚ÄúReports of a Currency War Have Been Greatly Exaggerated,‚Äù Credit Suisse Head of Global Commodities Strategy Ric Deverell and Anezka Christovova, a currency strategist at Credit Suisse, argued there was no evidence of ‚Äúsubstantial manipulation‚Äù in the past year by the G4 economies, which include the U.S., EU, Japan and Britain. Any talk suggesting otherwise, the report said, was ‚Äúmuch ado about nothing.‚Äù ‚ÄúIn our view, what we are primarily seeing is a move to increasingly experimental monetary policies aimed at boosting domestic demand,‚Äù Deverell and Christovova said in reference to the massive asset-buying programs of the United States and Japan. Policymakers have had to resort to these ‚Äúnon-conventional policies‚Äù because lowering interest rates to near zero in response to the global recession failed to revive their stricken economies. ‚ÄúWhile this has had an impact on exchange rates, it has not been the focus,‚Äù they said, adding that in ‚Äúreal effective terms,‚Äù the dollar, yen, euro and sterling were within 10 percent of the 30-year average. ‚ÄúThere is little evidence that current exchange rates are substantially out of equilibrium,‚Äù Deverell and Christovova explained. ‚ÄúBased on the Credit Suisse fair value model, the (Chinese) RMB is the only currency significantly undervalued at present.‚Äù It is not only emerging market currencies that have been appreciating in value. Despite deep economic problems in the euro zone, the euro had been strengthening before the bailout of Cyprus was announced, fuelling fears that a strong currency could hurt European exporters and further delay the region‚Äôs recovery. The euro began rising again once Cypriot banks reopened, and continued as Japan announced its most recent stimulus. The main reason for the euro‚Äôs strength, according to Credit Suisse, had been the reduction in the size of the European Central Bank‚Äôs balance sheet as euro-area banks began repaying emergency loans to the ECB. The ECB balance sheet is shrinking just when the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan (BOJ) are expanding theirs through their respective asset-buying programs, putting upward pressure on the euro. Credit Suisse expects the euro, which has been trading around $1.28, could reach $1.40 in the next year, as the Fed buys $85 billion in assets a month and the BOJ recently announced it would accelerate government bond purchases to nearly ¬•84 trillion this year, the equivalent of 17 percent of GDP. However, the bank noted that downside risks to the euro were building as European economic conditions deteriorated. The latest Markit composite purchasing managers‚Äô index, which measures activity in the manufacturing and services sectors, came in at 46.5 in March, compared with 47.9 in February, indicating further contraction in those industries. Markit chief economist Chris Williamson said the data suggested the euro zone recession was ‚Äúdeepening.‚Äù European Central Bank President Mario Draghi on Thursday did not rule out an interest rate cut at the ECB‚Äôs policy meeting next month, and he left open the door to the use of ‚Äúnon-standard measures‚Äù to revive the economy, such as bond purchases. With the major economies expected to continue their quantitative easing programs for the duration of 2013, Credit Suisse warned that emerging market policymakers, especially those who intervene to fix exchange rates, a process known as a dirty float, were ‚Äúunlikely to be passive bystanders.‚Äù In a report entitled ‚ÄúThe ‚ÄòReal‚Äô Currency Wars,‚Äù Credit Suisse said it expected to see ‚Äúmany dirty floats getting even dirtier over the coming year.‚Äù

This was down 1 percent month-over-month. Certain housing markets have recovered well and economists are getting increasingly bullish about the national housing recovery. But housing is a local story and many continue to suffer from an extremely high foreclosure rate.¬† "Although the overall national foreclosure trend continues to head lower, late-blooming foreclosures are bolting higher in some local markets where aggressive foreclosure prevention efforts in previous years are wearing off,‚Äù said Daren Blomquist, vice president at RealtyTrac in a press release. We drew on RealtyTrac's report to highlight the 14 metros with the highest foreclosure rate. Note: The metros are ranked by foreclosure rate i.e. 1 in every X homes received a foreclosure filing. We picked the 14 metros with the highest foreclosure rate from all the metros measured by RealtyTrac.

Werner Kunz / FlickrIt'll be a busy morning for both earnings and economic news today.† Banking giants Wells Fargo and JP Morgan will announce their Q1 earnings first. Here's a roundup of the economic news from Calculated Risk's Bill McBride:
CNBCIn further evidence of growing exuberance over prospects for Japanese stocks, U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs late Thursday upgraded its 12-month target for both Japanese benchmarks - the Nikkei and Topix - on expectations of bumper earnings growth. It increased its target for Nikkei to 16,000 from 15,000 and for the Topix to 1,350 from 1,250 earlier, which marks a near 20 percent upside from current levels. "Last week's announcement by [Bank of Japan] Governor Haruhiko Kuroda was the most credible attack on deflation that Japan has seen in a very long time, there's prospect for Japan to exit this liquidity trap and get its domestic economy back on its feet," Kathy Mitsui, chief Japan strategist at Goldman Sachs told CNBC on Friday. (Read More: BOJ Throws In Kitchen Sink in War With Deflation) For the Topix, Mitsui forecasts earnings per share growth of 54 percent in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2014 and 23 percent in following year, driven by expectations of stronger gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the world's third largest economy and continued weakness in the yen. The bank expects the yen to weaken to 105 against the U.S. dollar by the end of the year, and to 110 in 2014. Gains in the Topix - which has risen almost 60 percent since mid-November when Prime Minister Shinzo Abe unveiled in his bold election campaign to boost the economy with expansionary fiscal and monetary policies - have largely be driven by foreign investor inflows. Japan's equity markets have seen $60 billion in foreign inflows over this period, which has also pushed the Nikkei up over 55 percent. And, while this will continue to be a major force for the country's stocks, Mitsui said, there is also potential for domestic retail investors to increase their participation in the market. (Read More: Uniqlo Shrugs Off Row, Picks China for Biggest Store) "Retail investors are gradually beginning to sniff around looking at higher yielding names. There is going to be a time when some domestic money, particularly retail and mutual fund money begins to trickle in again," she said. Betting on Consumption  As Japanese corporates experience an upswing in profits, Mitsui expects companies will begin to share the fruits of their recovery with workers, providing a boost to consumption. There has been anecdotal evidence of some corporates in the auto and retail space beginning to offer bonuses, she said, adding that this trend will likely become more widespread by next year. Based on expectations of increased spending, Goldman recommends investing in department stores, luxury property developers, high-end housing equipment companies, and travel and leisure firms. (Read More: Demand Up 50% on 'Abenomics,' Says Property Head) "Those areas are going to see the light of day finally as the economy emerges from an environment of falling to rising prices," she said. Key Risk to Forecast  Mitsui, however, cautioned that the bank's forecast isn't without risks, identifying policy implementation as a possible hurdle for the market. "The investor base has raised their expectations for 'Abenomics.' He started with the first two prongs of his growth strategy - the fiscal stimulus and now the monetary stimulus is coming through - but the third leg of that still remains structural reforms," she said. (Read More: 'Abenomics' Gamble: How to Tell If It's Paying Off) "But there are some good signs, he [Abe] bit the bullet by overcoming fierce opposition by the farm lobby to agree that Japan will enter the Trans Pacific Partnership [talks]," Mitsui said referring to the U.S.-led trade negotiations with Asia Pacific economies.
The move of the S&amp;P 500 into new all-time highs is based on neither the economy, nor earnings, nor value, but almost completely on the blind faith that the Fed can single-handedly flood the market with enough funds to keep the illusion going.¬† In this sense the similarity of the current stock market to the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s or the housing bubble ending in 2007 is glaring. Although first quarter GDP growth looks as if it could come in at 3%-to-3.5%, the economy was clearly losing steam in March.¬† The NFIB small business survey slipped in March, and is just two points above its lowest point of the past year and three points lower than a year ago.¬† The breakdown indicated lower sales, weak expectations and historically low plans to hire.¬† March payroll employment dropped sharply to only 88,000 while the ISM manufacturing index declined to its lowest level since August with drops in new orders, employment and export orders.¬† The March ISM non-manufacturing index declined to 51.3 from 54.2 a month earlier, the lowest point since December.¬† Real consumer spending has been growing at a mediocre 2% rate over the past year despite growth of only 0.9% in real disposable income over the same period.¬† This was accomplished mainly by decreasing the savings rate to only 2.6% in February, compared to rates of 7%-to-11% in more prosperous times.¬† With employment growth diminishing and the negative effects of the January tax increases and the sequester yet to kick in, consumer spending is likely to slow markedly in the period ahead.¬† While March year-over-year comparisons may benefit from an earlier Easter, the reverse will probably be true in April.¬† Keep in mind, too, our over-riding theme that consumers, still burdened with most of the debt built up in the housing boom, are in no shape to jump-start their spending. Investors have also apparently forgotten the January tax increases and the sequester.¬† The combination is likely to reduce GDP growth by 1.75%.¬† First quarter GDP would have to grow 3.6% just to maintain the 2% trajectory of the past two years.¬† Subtracting 1.75% from the 2% leaves very little room for growth.¬† Corporate earnings, too, are no longer behind the rise in the market.¬† S&amp;P 500 operating earnings were up only 0.4% in 2012 with the third and fourth quarters down from a year-earlier.¬† The consensus is looking for a 15% rise in 2013 earnings, a number we regard as highly unrealistic given the substantial headwinds facing the economy.¬† We note that year-ahead earnings forecasts have historically been extremely inaccurate, and have usually erred by being too optimistic. In addition the market is actually substantially overvalued.¬† Those who believe that the market is either undervalued or reasonably valued use year-ahead estimates of operating earnings.¬† In our view this method of valuation is flawed.¬† As we stated above, the estimates are usually wrong, and mostly on the high side.¬† Furthermore, the use of operating earnings is not compatible with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).¬† Historically, the use of GAAP earnings always results in significantly higher P/E ratios than operating earnings.¬† Another distortion occurs as a result of the volatility of earnings over the business cycle.¬† The P/E at peak earnings are almost always lower than the P/E at trough earnings.¬† Therefore the use of P/E ratios at periods of high earnings tends to show misleadingly low P/E ratios.¬† The way to solve this distortion is to smooth earnings over a longer period that includes one or more complete business cycles.¬† Our estimate of smoothed trailing GAAP S&amp;P 500 earnings is about $81, resulting in a P/E ratio of 19.6 at current levels.¬† Other estimates of smoothed earnings by Robert Shiller and Ned Davis result in even higher P/E ratios than ours. In sum, the lack of support from the economy, earnings or valuation leaves the Fed as the only game in town.¬† Although the old adage says ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt fight the Fed‚Äù, it did pay to fight the Fed in 2001 and 2002 and again from late 2007 to early 2009.¬† In our view, the Fed can only try to offset the tightness coming from the fiscal side, but cannot get the economy growing on a sustainable basis.

Eurozone countries are falling like dominos.But bailouts‚Äîfunded by taxpayers in other countries‚Äîkeep banks from collapsing, governments from defaulting, and investors from incurring well-deserved losses. Bailout money that no one has. And so it's borrowed. Borrowing is pain free, and easier than collecting taxes. Until it‚Äôs impossible. Hence a debt crisis. In the US, we talk about ‚Äúrevenues‚Äù instead of taxes. President Obama‚Äôs budget is circulating, and it has that word in it, causing heart palpitations and conniptions left and right. But how do countries stack up against each other when it comes to taxes? In the graph below, the 34 countries of the OECD are ranked by the amount of taxes they collected from all sources in 2010‚Äîincome, consumptions, assets, etc., at local and national levels‚Äîas a percent of GDP. Denmark, perched precariously at the top of the list, extracts nearly half of its GDP in taxes, followed by Sweden, followed by 10 of the 17 Eurozone countries‚Äîplus Hungary. We used to live in Belgium and can confirm that much of what you earn is taken. While it may be a tax haven of sorts for rich foreigners with unique tax problems who get taxed to death in their own countries, Belgium is a tough place for people who make and spend their money there! And there are disparities: France confiscates 42.9% of its GDP in taxes‚Äîand that was before a slew of tax increases were passed in 2012. Germany takes 36.1%. Yet, France‚Äôs deficit is ballooning while Germany had a nearly balanced budget in 2012. The bailed-out debt-crisis countries are all in the lower tax-extraction category: Spain (32.3%), Portugal (31.7%), and Greece (30.9%)‚ÄîGreeks at all levels, particularly independent professionals such as doctors and lawyers, and of course the elite, have figured out how to avoid paying taxes. Then there‚Äôs Ireland (27.6%). Bailed-out Cyprus isn‚Äôt on the list because it isn‚Äôt a member of the OECD; in 1995, its application was vetoed by Turkey. However, in 2010, Cyprus was the second richest country in the Eurozone! With its 10% corporate income tax and other tax advantages, it would have one of the lower tax burdens. Alas, these five countries that have relatively low tax burdens now expect taxpayers in other countries‚Äîcountries that have much higher tax burdens‚Äîto bail them out. Hapless taxpayers in Belgium, for example, are tasked to pay twice: once to keep their own governmental apparatus greased and to bail out their banks, such as Dexia; and a second time to bail out countries whose taxpayers refuse to do it themselves. The graph shows the ranking of the 34 OECD countries (data from the OECD via the Center for Tax Justice). And who is near the very bottom?  The biggest fiscal basket case of them all, the real one, the one that is blowing up in slow motion right now, Japan, whose gross national debt will exceed 240% of GDP by the end of this fiscal year, has given its people and companies a free ride for years. All manner of huge subsidies and handouts for Japan Inc. on top of a welfare state par excellence for the people add up to a majestic tab. The way they‚Äôve paid for much of the tab, given the relatively light tax burden of 27.6%: borrowed and printed money. Near the very bottom of the list, in third place, is the US (includes federal, state, and local taxes). Among OECD countries, only Mexico and Chile have a smaller tax burden. Over the last thirty years, taxes in the US have ranged from a high of 29.5% of GDP in 2000 (capital gains!) to a low of 24.2% in 2009. The noble rank of 32 out of 34 was first achieved in 2009, after a long uneven progression from 16 out of the then 24 OECD countries in 1979. If Congress could just hold spending down to that level! But that‚Äôs the hard part. Cutting taxes, any idiot can do that. As the value of a Bitcoin soars and dives and soars and dives even more in mega-percentages, and as perfectly sane people wonder what the heck it is and then suddenly jump on the bandwagon with both feet, a computer security researcher and software developer pokes around in its ugly innards. Read.... Bitcoin:¬†Bait-And-Switch?
Mt. Gox, the world's largest Bitcoin exchange, reopened at 10 PM ET Thursday following a 12-hour trading halt. The virtual currency plunged to $78, instantly losing 35% of its value from where it was when trading was halted earlier in the day ($120). From Wednesday's intraday peak of $266, Bitcoin had lost 70% of its value. After a few wild swings tonight, Bitcoin is now trading around $97¬†(down 19 percent from before the trading halt and 64 percent off Wednesday's high). bitcoin.clarkmoody.com Note: This chart has no x-axis, but it shows Bitcoin prices from April 9 through today. Earlier today, Mt. Gox halted trading, saying the market needed to "cool down" after a massive sell-off yesterday that at one point resulted in a 61% decline from the virtual currency's peak intraday price of $266. The problem, according to the exchange, was a massive influx of new users in recent days, causing the trading platform to lag, which sparked a sell-off among skittish traders. Trading tonight has been volatile. Bitcoin has been trading below $100 on smaller, less liquid exchanges while the Mt. Gox exchange has been closed.
