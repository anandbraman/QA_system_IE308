Chinese data disappointed markets again in May. Here's a quick round-up: Business Insider The key takeaways: Bottomline: Most economic indicators missed expectations. The latest data continues "to paint a picture of soft domestic demand and general growth deceleration," according to Yao.

The GuardianEdward Snowden.The fact that former National Security Agency employee Edward Snowden decided to go public with his grievances against the U.S. government is certainly brave and bold.  People can and will accuse Snowden of many things. But no one will ever accuse him of not having the guts to stand up for what he believes. Whether or not Snowden should be regarded as a "hero" for exposing what he believes is horrible intelligence gathering abuse by the U.S. government, however--as some are already suggesting he should be--remains to be seen. Snowden has certainly made some startling claims about the scope of the U.S. intelligence and surveillance programs. Most notably, Snowden claims that, as a 29 year-old security contractor, he had both the legal authority and the technological ability to "wiretap anyone — from you or your accountant, to a federal judge, to even the President." If that's true, that is indeed very startling. Snowden also claims that the National Security Agency now intercepts and records almost all global communications, and that these recorded communications can be easily accessed:  "...the vast majority of human communications are automatically ingested [by the NSA] without targeting. If I wanted to see your emails or your wife's phone, all I have to do is use intercepts. I can get your emails, passwords, phone records, credit cards." Now, the NSA--or FBI, DOJ, or even your local police department--have always been able to get access to all of this information for U.S. citizens, provided they have a warrant from a judge allowing them to do so and provided you or your service providers have retained these records. But what seems new, based on Snowden's description, is that the government is now maintaining its own records of all this information and, if I understand Snowden correctly, can now access and use any of it without a warrant. If that's true, it's certainly worth asking whether we really want the government to be able to do that. It's also worth asking whether the the government really does have the legal authority to do that--or whether it has gone way beyond what the lawmakers intended. But, I, for one, would like some confirmation that what Snowden is saying is true before I denounce the government.  And some of the other things that Snowden has said have certainly made me wonder whether he isn't just viewing all this from a philosophical perspective that mainstream Americans might consider, well, extreme. Asked why he decided to leak classified information to the media, for example, Snowden said the following: "I don't want to live in a society that does these sort of things … I do not want to live in a world where everything I do and say is recorded. That is not something I am willing to support or live under." Asked whether surveillance might help deter or prevent terrorism, Snowden appeared to suggest that we shouldn't pay so much attention to terrorism:  "We have to decide why terrorism is a new threat. There has always been terrorism. Boston was a criminal act. It was not about surveillance but good, old-fashioned police work. The police are very good at what they do." Asked whether he sees himself as "another Bradley Manning," the U.S. Army private who sent a boatload of classified U.S. documents to Wikileaks, Snowden expressed nothing but admiration for Manning: "Manning was a classic whistleblower. He was inspired by the public good." To address these statements in reverse order... Bradley Manning may have been "inspired by" his own personal view of the "public good." But, personally, I'm not convinced that what Bradley Manning did was actually good for the public. I don't think it was terrible for the public. And it was certainly interesting to read some of those diplomatic communications. But I didn't see anything in them that made me think they were so important that they were worth Manning violating his professional duty, breaking the law, and risking a lifetime in jail to make them public.  (And, for what it's worth, I do think that some things should be classified.) I agree that we worry a lot about terrorism relative to many other dangers, but I am also happy that there has not been another 9/11 since 9/11, and I wish the FBI had stopped the deranged Tsarnaev brothers before they allegedly killed four innocent people in Boston and maimed a few dozen others. I understand that the authorities will never be able to eliminate terrorism entirely, but I am glad that they've limited it as much as they have. And, lastly, although I don't relish the thought of having the government intercept and record all of my communications, I want to find out whether it's actually true that the government is doing this before I freak out about it. Also, because I am not a terrorist, because this country has a well-developed legal system, and because I do not instinctively regard all government employees as evil power-hungry scumbags, I would also like to believe that, even if the government is recording all of my communications, this won't necessarily wreck my life. All of which is to say... I'm not yet ready to pronounce Edward Snowden a "hero." I understand that he means well. And I understand that he may think he's a hero. But he hasn't persuaded me of that yet. SEE ALSO: Edward Snowden Claims He Had Mind-Blowing Power As A Low-Level Spy
Some people think that even though the economy has been slowly but surely growing, most of the new jobs that have been created have been "bad" ones — low-wage gigs in the retail and service sectors. But High Frequency Economics' Jim O'Sullivan says that's not the case. In a new note, he compares the rate of earnings growth to the increase in wages as measured by the employment cost index, which is evenly weighted across all sectors, and finds they've been on the same track. If only bad jobs were being created, the former measure would be falling further. Here's the chart: HFE And here's his full take: One part of the May employment report that was weaker than expected was the flat reading for average hourly earnings. Despite that weakness, the change from a year ago was stable at 2.0%, which is around where the trend has been since 2010. Year-over-year gains averaged 2.0% in 2011, 1.9% in 2012 and 2.0% in Q1 of this year. While not strong, the pace has not been any weaker than the pace for wages in the fixed-weighted employment cost index—the ECI.  That pattern disproves the widespread impression that mainly “bad” below-average-wage jobs are being created. Average hourly earnings would be declining relative to wages in the ECI if job growth were disproportionately weighted toward below-average-wage jobs. That has not happened. If anything, the data show the opposite pattern.   
Internshipmovie.comOwen Wilson and Vince Vaughn make Google's internship look pretty fun in "The Internship," which opened on Friday, and the movie is surprisingly accurate. Google remains the best internship program in America, according to ratings by interns at career site Glassdoor. In terms of pay, Microsoft interns earn the most, with anÂ average monthly base pay ofÂ $5,869. JP Morgan is the highest-rated financial company on the list and made the biggest improvements, jumping nine spots, compared to last February. To qualify companies have to be currently hiring interns and have at least 20 intern reviews posted on Glassdoor.
APHey, "direct access" sounded much more exciting and scandalous. Can we put that back?As the actual details of the government's data collection under its "PRISM" intelligence program are emerging, the hysteria that followed the initial reports is, justifiably, dying down.  Thanks to vehement, explicit denials by America's big technology companies, it is becoming clearer that the government does not, as the initial reports stated, have "direct access" to the central servers of Google, Facebook, Yahoo, et al — access with which the FBI and National Security Agency can spy on any of hundreds of millions of global users any time they feel like it. Instead, it seems clear that, as in ordinary legal processes, the government frequently requests specific user data from these companies, and, after a legal review, if the companies deem the requests to be lawful, the companies are making the data available to the government. Based on the companies' statements, as well as many follow-on news reports and our conversations with technology industry sources, the hullabaloo about "direct access" appears to stem from a misunderstanding about what "direct access" actually means. What the companies appear to be doing is delivering electronic data that the government has requested — after the companies review the request to make sure the request is legal. Once the companies have delivered the data, the government can access the data on a server, and query it however the government wants. But this does not mean the government has unfettered "direct access" to the companies' central servers and billions of users, as the initial PRISM reports implied. Given the volume of the information that the government is collecting, it's certainly reasonable to consider whether American laws are appropriate and whether the necessary checks and balances in place — or whether we are focusing too much on "security" and not enough on "privacy." And, as ever, it's also worth making sure that the government is following the laws. Importantly, however, these questions have nothing to do with the technology companies. Even the Washington Post has revised its story about government spying and no longer claims that the FBI and NSA are "directly tapping into the central servers" of the big tech companies.* So, as the reality of the process by which the tech companies make legally requested information available to the government becomes clear, the debate should shift to the laws and government behavior. Is the secret FISA court that approves specific information requests under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act being too permissive in its approvals? Is the government following the law? Should the FISA oversight or laws be changed? Those questions are worth asking. But it seems highly misleading to continue to suggest that America's biggest technology companies are secretly in cahoots with government spies, are providing direct access to central servers, and are selling out billions of users worldwide.  * The Post's original story stated as an unqualified fact that Google, Facebook, et al, were allowing the government to "tap directly into the[ir] central servers" to spy on their users. After the story was published and the companies issued immediate and categorical denials, the Post revised its story significantly. Now the "direct access" claim is tied to a government document that some people say is being misinterpreted. And even the Post has now explained that the government is merely receiving electronic deliveries of requested data that the government can then query and analyze (just as the government does in any investigation): According to a more precise description contained in a classified NSA inspector general’s report, also obtained by The Post, PRISM allows “collection managers [to send] content tasking instructions directly to equipment installed at company-controlled locations,” rather than directly to company servers. The companies cannot see the queries that are sent from the NSA to the systems installed on their premises, according to sources familiar with the PRISM process. Crucial aspects about the mechanisms of data transfer remain publicly unknown. Several industry officials told The Post that the system pushes requested data from company servers to classified computers at FBI facilities at Quantico. The information is then shared with the NSA or other authorized intelligence agencies. [Our guess is the Post will soon be further revising that last sentence to clarify that it is not "the system" that pushes the requested data to the FBI servers, but the companies. And that would mirror how any company provides requested data to the government — by sending it to them or putting it on a server where the government can get it.] According to other reports, such as the one The New York Times filed yesterday, the companies haven't even given the government access to shared delivery servers on their premises. So, the more details that come out, the more it sounds as though the tech companies are just providing the government with standard electronic delivery of requested data.
Flickr/jking89A good internship can lead to a job, great references, and valuable experience. A bad internship can turn out to be a waste of time and money for everyone involved.

REUTERS/Laurent Dubrule It's okay to spy on the queen of the Netherlands. She's a "foreigner!"As the actual details of the government's "PRISM" intelligence program begin to emerge, the hysteria that followed the initial reports is dying down. Thanks to vehement, explicit denials by all of America's big technology companies, it is becoming clear that the government does not, as the initial reports stated, have "direct access" to the central servers of Google, Facebook, Yahoo, et al--access with which the FBI and National Security Agency can spy on any of hundreds of millions of global users anytime they feel like it.

And, as ever, it's also worth making sure that the government is following the laws. Those are important questions, but they have nothing to do with the technology companies. So, as the reality of the process by which the tech companies make legally requested information available to the government becomes clear, the debate should shift to the laws and government behavior. From a high-level perspective, in other words, the PRISM program seems to operate pretty much the way one would expect it to operate. The government collects as much electronic communications data as it can--because electronic communications are the way almost everyone communicates these days. And when the government sees behavior that arouses its suspicion, it asks the FISA court for permission to request specific user data from companies under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. And then government reviews this data to see whether further investigation is warranted. One thing that is interesting--and, to many people, offensive--about the way the U.S. government is defending the PRISM program, however, is by reassuring people that the program can only be used to spy on "foreigners." The U.S. government appears to assume that, once people realize that PRISM is focused on "foreigners," they won't care what the government does. And maybe, unfortunately, the government is right about that--at least in America. But most people in the world--and most of the billions of users of Facebook, Google, Yahoo, and other major Internet services--won't likely be so sanguine. That's because these people do not happen to be Americans. They happen to be "foreigners." And that means that they are included in the group of ~7 billion non-Americans that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act apparently gives the U.S. government considerable freedom to spy on. If all ~7 billion "foreigners" in the world were likely to be potential terrorists, and the 300 million Americans were not potential terrorists, this logic might make sense. But as recent events in Boston have shown, Americans can also be potential terrorists. And most of the ~7 billion "foreigners" targeted by PRISM, meanwhile, are law-abiding folks who would never dream of blowing up planes or killing innocent people. These "foreigners," moreover, also constitute the vast majority of the users and customers of Google, Facebook, Yahoo, and other American tech companies. So the idea that these companies would voluntarily and happily allow the U.S. government to spy willy nilly on these "foreigners" is both outrageous and offensive. What this renewed focus on U.S. government intelligence programs has revealed, in other words, is not just the concern that these programs may now be going too far. It is that some Americans still don't appear to appreciate that we live in a highly globalized world--a world in which assurances that massive American spying programs are only focused on "foreigners" won't come as much comfort to the billions of customers who have helped make some of our companies the most powerful and richest in the world.
Alex Jones, radio host and owner of Infowars.com, appeared on the BBC's Sunday Politics show today to talk about the Bilderberg Conference â€” the secretive gathering of the world's political and financial elite currently taking place in Watford, England. Jones is always an over-the-top guest (as we saw in this interview with Piers Morgan last year), but this time he was extra wild â€” even by his own standards. By the end of the segment, Jones was shouting about how the euro was a Nazi plot and the government is trying to poison people through the water supply. Host Andrew Neil, a legend in British journalism, was reduced to laughter by Jones' outbursts, finally telling him "you're the worst person I have ever interviewed" and informing viewers "we have an idiot on the programme today." You can watch below (the interview begins around 4 minutes in):  Jones is not well-known in the U.K., so the British press appear to have been taken by surprise. Writing at the Telegraph, Tim Stanley wonders why Jones acts so crazy: Two theories. One, heâ€™s in this for the money. According to Neil, as soon as the camera was off he reverted to a perfectly normal, non-ranty human being. What he does is a performance designed to get listeners for his tawdry show â€“ notice that throughout the segment he keeps shouting out his website address. Alternatively, perhaps Jones is actually part of the New World Order conspiracy? Maybe he gets his orders from the Queen of England and her partner in crime Bush/Soros/Ming the Merciless and the whole act is about making us laugh at something we ought to be scared of. Perhaps theyâ€™re all a bunch of lizards and they like to get together every Halloween to eat mice. At the New Statesman, Helen Lewis worried about Jones' popularity: If you're tempted to dismiss Jones as a fringe crank, it's sobering to remember that he claims more than two million listeners for his radio show, and more than 250 million views for his YouTube videos. However, many people were simply entertained. Political blog Guido Fawkes called it "TV gold." Not content with the scene he had created during the show, Jones apparently had more planned. In a video that appears to have been recorded on a phone and posted to his website, Jones confronts another guest on the show â€” British Labour party politician (and Bilderberg member) Ed Balls. "Why can't you guys talk about Bilderberg?" Jones asks politely, before Balls is escorted away: 
ReutersThe latest lending data out of China missed expectations. New outstanding loans fell to 667 billion yuan, from 793 billionÂ yuan in April. This was also short expectations of 815 billion yuan. Outstanding loans were up 14.5% in May, down from 14.9% in April. Total social financing (TSF) â€” financing available to the economy from the financial sector â€” fell to 1.190 trillion yuan, down from 1.747 trillionÂ yuan in April. This was shy of expectations for 1.6 trillion yuan. TSF eased to 22.1% in May, from 22.3% the previous month.Â  Meanwhile, M2, a broad measure of money supply, was up 15.8% in May, down from 16.1% in April. "These lower than expected credit data will likely trigger market concerns about monetary tightening when economic momentum stays weak," wrote Bank of America's Ting Lu.Â  "However, after going through the data details, we believe that the seemingly disappointing headline new loan and TSF data reflect that those arbitrage activities were being squeezed by tougher regulatory rules, which is actually good for the health of Chinaâ€™s financial system." Concerns of a Chinese credit crisis Total Social Financing is a Chinese measure of credit growth that includes â€” outstanding bank loans, trust and entrusted loans, bankersâ€™ acceptance, and corporate bonds. In their annual Article IV review of the Chinese economy published late last month, the IMF warned about the growth in total social financing.Â  "The rapid growth in total social financingâ€”a broad measure of creditâ€”raises concerns about the quality of investment and its impact on repayment capacity, especially since a fast-growing share of credit is flowing through less-well supervised parts of the financial system." BAMLThe main bear argument on China now is that it is taking more and more credit growth, to deliver less and less economic growth. The People's Bank of China's 2013 financial stability report also warned of the "perils of bad loans." The bad loan balance was at 1.07 trillion yuan at the end of 2012. Defaulted loans of commercial banks was up 46% from the start of the year to 528.1 billion yuan. And analysts warn that companies' ability to repay loans is declining. We also saw a liquidity squeeze last week, ahead of the Dragon boat festival. Of course some argue that with the state backing banks and companies, a crisis is unlikely. But this has raised concerns about long-term growth and the health of China's financial system.

Kapell was one of the subjects of a piece on magnets on CBS Sunday Morning. Magnetic Poetry turned refrigerator owners around the world into creative writers. However, refrigerators have been changing. According to CBS, more than 30% of refrigerators sold in 2012 had stainless steel doors. Magnets don't stick to these. Kapell told CBS the stainless steel fridge boom cut his sales in half. And it's not just the stainless steel hurting his business.

Wikimedia Commons Banzai! Banzai! Banzai!   I shot an Arrow into the air It fell to earth I know not where….                          -  Henry Wadsworth Longfellow As kids, not knowing that we were being politically incorrect on so many levels, we would shout “Geronimo!” when we were playing war or getting ready to do something reckless. (For those not familiar, Geronimo was a rather fearsome Apache chief who plagued Mexico and the American cavalry.) Sam Houston and his fellows cried, “Remember the Alamo!” as they rode down upon Santa Ana at San Jacinto. The British went to battle with “God Save the Queen [or King]!” Confederate soldiers took up the rebel yell as they charged live bullets and fixed bayonets. Every good war movie has its own memorable moment of the battle charge. In Japan, the term Banzai! literally means “ten thousand years” and can be used to wish someone long life and happiness. But during World War II, “Banzai!” was shouted in battle. It was the Japanese equivalent of "Long live the king!" – but to soldiers on the other side it came to mean a suicidal, hell-for-leather attack. If the central bankers of the world think they're hearing a battle cry of “Banzai!” from the lips of their Japanese brethren, they may not be far from wrong, because the Japanese are indeed on a mad charge to fight deflation at all costs. As with all good suicidal charges, at least in legend and lore, once the cry has gone up and the thundering charge has begun, there can be no turning back. For the last three weeks, I have been making what I personally think is a rather strong case that the Japanese have embarked on what may be simultaneously the most outrageous, intriguing, and desperate monetary policy experiment by a major economic power in history. (Those letters are here, here, and here). The Japanese are rapidly coming to their own Endgame, the end of their ability to borrow money at interest rates that are economically rational. If interest rates on Japanese bonds rise to a mere 2.2%, 80% of tax revenues will go just to pay the interest on their debt. At a 245% debt-to-GDP ratio, they are in desperate straits, and they know it. And desperate times call for desp erate measures. To get to where they want to go, to grow their way out of their deflationary problem, the Japanese need both inflation and real growth. Real growth can come from massively increased exports, and inflation can even come from an increase in export prices. Both results can be obtained by weakening the yen. As I have shown, they need to devalue the yen by 15-20% a year for many years in order to break through to the other side. That should be easy, at least in theory. Inflation, Milton Friedman famously said, is “always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.” If you want to create inflation and devalue your currency, just print more money. A second shift in the print shop is in order, and if that doesn’t produce the desired results a third shift can be arranged, and then you can run full tilt on weekends. And soon maybe it will be time to build another print shop. But that is the theory. In practice it may be harder for Japan to grow and generate inflation than it might be for other major nations. Today we'll focus on Japanese demographics. While the letter is full of graphs and charts, it does not paint a pretty picture. The forces of deflation will not go gently into that good night. But first, a couple of quick notes. At the end of the letter, there is a link for Mauldin Circle members to the first crop of videos from my recent Strategic Investment Conference (co-hosted with Altegris Investments). These videos highlight some of our most popular speakers, including Kyle Bass, Niall Ferguson, Mohamed El-Erian, Lacy Hunt, and David Rosenberg. The final batch of videos will be ready in a few weeks. (If you are already a member of the Mauldin Circle in the US, you should have been sent that link.) Second, yesterday in New York we taped our video webinar in which I was joined by John Hussman, Barry Ritholtz, Mohamed El-Erian, Kyle Bass, and David Rosenberg. It was quite a day, and you can join us (for free) when the event goes live on Tuesday at 2 PM EDT. Click right here to register.  And now, let’s shout “Banzai!” together as we dive right into Japanese demographics.   The Demographics of Doom Creating inflation is the goal, but Prime Minister Abe and Bank of Japan Governor Kuroda face a very difficult task. Unlike in Zimbabwe, Argentina, and a host of other countries with defunct fiat currencies, in Japan it is not simply a matter of racking up untenable amounts of debt and then printing tons of money. If it were that simple, inflation would be rampant in Japan, for the Japanese have borrowed more than any country in modern history (relative to their size). And while their efforts to create inflation have been futile, it is not for lack of trying: the Japanese have been actively pursuing quantitative easing for many years. Carl Weinberg of High Frequency Economics, writing in the Globe and Mail, gives us a very succinct summary of the Japanese dilemma: The National Institute of Population and Social Security Research projects that Japan’s working-age population will decline over the next 17 years, to 67.7 million people by 2030 from 81.7 million in 2010. We select 2030 as the endpoint of today’s discussion because almost all the people who will be in the working-age population by 2030, 17 years from now, have been born already. Immigration and emigration are trivial. The 17-per-cent decline in the working-age population is a certainty, not a forecast. It averages out to a decline of 0.9 per cent a year. In addition, these official projections show a rise in the population aged over 64 to 36.9 million in 2030 from 29.5 million in 2010. If the labour-force participation rate stays constant, we estimate the number of people seeking work in the economy will fall to 56.5 million by 2030 from 65.5 million today and 66 million in 2010. What happens when a nation’s population declines and the proportion of working-age people decreases? In the first, simplest, level of analysis, the production potential of the economy declines: Fewer workers can produce fewer goods. This does not mean GDP must decline; productivity gains could offset a decline in the labour force. Also, an increase in the labour-force participation rate could mute the effect of a declining working-age population. However, even if the labour force participation rate were to rise to 100 per cent by 2030 from 81 per cent today (which it cannot, because some people have to care for the old and the young, and some are disabled or lack adequate skills or education), there would be fewer workers available in 2030 than there are today. With fewer people working, the burden of servicing the public-sector debt will be higher for each individual worker. We project that the debt-to-GDP ratio and the debt-per-worker ratio will grow unabated over the next 17 years and beyond. Also, the rise of the ratio of retired workers to 32 per cent of the population from 23 per cent means that people who are still working in 2030 will have to give up a rising share of their income to support retirees. The disposable income of the declining number of workers will fall faster than the decline of production and employment. Overall demand of workers will decrease – with their disposable income – faster than output for the next 17 years at least. Demand will also fall as new retirees spend less than in their earning years. Based on demographic factors alone, the decline of aggregate demand between now and 2030 will exceed the decline of output, creating persistent and widening excess capacity in the economy. Prices must fall in an economy where slack is steadily increasing. In addition, advancing technology will likely increase output per worker in the future. With overall demand and output falling, productivity gains will lower labour costs and add to downward pressure on prices. Disinflation and deflation are the companions of demographic decline. Andrew Cates, an economist for UBS, based in Singapore, published a penetrating study on the relationship between inflation and demographics this week. He notes that countries with older populations tend to have lower inflation. That is not what the textbooks suggest, but it's what the data reveals: Since ageing demographics will now start to feature more prominently in the outlook for many major developed and developing countries this is clearly of some significance for how inflation might evolve from here. By extension it could be of greater significance for monetary policy settings and the broader outlook for global growth and financial markets as well. Let’s first look at the evidence. In the chart below we show average inflation levels over the last 5 years plotted against the 5-year change in the dependency ratio. The latter is the ratio of the very old and the very young to the population of working age. A shift down in that ratio implies that the population in a given country is getting younger (and vice versa). The chart therefore shows that those countries that have been getting older in recent years have typically faced very low inflation rates and, in the case of Japan, deflation. In the meantime those countries that have been getting younger in recent years, such as India, Turkey, Indonesia and Brazil, have faced relatively high inflation rates. Cates looks not just at Japan but takes a more global view. However, Japan does stand out in this chart. (I do not have a link, as this work is just available from UBS for now.) I added the red box to highlight Japan:  And while correlation is not causation, the following graph of inflation vs. population growth in Japan does make you think.  And let's throw in one more chart from Mr. Cates. He notes that textbook economics suggests that a falling workforce tends to put upward pressure on wages (labor is just an input resource on the supply side), and thus one ends up with cost-push inflation: This, though, ignores other factors that are arguably of some relevance in the domestic inflation-generating process. Demographic influences for example will influence an economy’s natural demand for consumer durables, its housing stock and broader credit aggregates. The latter is certainly borne out by the reasonably close correlation that exists between credit and ageing in the chart below.  Finding Japanese Optimists As negative as all of the above sounds, you can find those who think the Japanese economy can turn itself around, that inflation can be drummed up, and that Japanese interest rates – even given the amount of monetization they are contemplating – will not rise. Seriously. Bloomberg News did a survey of five former Bank of Japan officials, all of whom believe that “any gains in government bond yields will be contained over the next two years.” Four of the five also don’t think 2% inflation is possible. Even with a wide-open printing press. You can decide for yourself whether Abenomics can accomplish 3 or 4% nominal growth. Just go to this story with an interactive graph from Reuters Breakingviews). (The screen shot included below is just intended to tantalize you to head over there.) Play with variables in the graph and decide what you think is possible. If you start with today’s trends, potential GDP growth is much less than 1%.  But what if, like Andy Mukherjee at Breakingviews, you get more optimistic? Japanese women participate in the labor force at just 63%, about the lowest female participation rate among developed nations. What if the participation rate of women rises dramatically because of the 250,000 new daycare jobs Abe has promised? And what if older people decide to work longer? And maybe men will do more (even though they have one of the highest participation rates now). And the unemployment rate could drop by, say, 40%. If you make such assumptions then you can get to a 1.5% growth rate (which, as I showed last week, is not anywhere near enough!). Abe has bet big that creating inflation will encourage people to no longer postpone spending in hopes that things will get even cheaper. Never mind that that is not how older people think. And those are the people in Japan with money to spend. Abe's program is yet another case of operating on the basis of textbook economic theory rather than the reality that is staring you in the face.  An aging population means that someone has to take care of parents as they get older. And in Japan (as in many other places) that responsibility usually falls to the women, which lowers the female participation rate. And where will they get those 250,000 daycare workers? And who is going to pay for them? Abe also promises that by 2020 the Japanese government will be running a surplus and that deficits will be down to the rate of nominal GDP growth within a few years. Which programs will get cut to pay for those daycare workers? And what about the serious need for nursing-home workers? There are far more old people in Japan than there are toddlers. While we are on the matter of promises, Abe also says he will enter into free-trade agreement talks with the rest of Asia and the US and open up the Japanese economy. All this while his currency is plummeting 15% a year, upsetting his neighbors and drastically changing the terms of trade? Now he wants to play nice in the global-trade sandbox? I wason Bloomberg with Tom Keene this morning. One of the other guests, talking about Japan’s opening up free-trade talks with the US, mentioned rice, which Japan famously protects, as a potential bargaining chip. “So,” I responded, “Japan decides it wants to drop the value of the yen by 50% and then open up its rice trade?” I was not impressed. I am a fairly big proponent of free trade, but Japan’s getting religion on free trade now, when they are on the brink of crisis, seems a tad disingenuous. I Shot an Arrow… into My Foot Abe has proposed an economic reform package comprising “three arrows”: aggressive monetary easing, labor and other structural reforms (which will be politically very difficult to achieve) intended to induce private-sector growth-promoting investment, and a flexible fiscal policy (whatever that means – I guess, since it's "flexible," it means whatever he decides it means).  He gave a speech this week on those reforms, and the market promptly threw up. The “reforms” he touted were more of the same old same old. At dinner on Wednesday night, Art Cashin modified the opening line from the old Longfellow poem: “I shot an arrow into the air… and it landed in my foot.” Not that I think Abe had much choice. He has a critical election next month. Touting a policy that allows employers a freer hand in firing workers is not likely to win over many voters, but he must get serious about reform if he is to have any hope of limiting the disaster he faces. I truly do feel sorry for retirees in Japan. I am reminded of that wonderful Japanese movie from the '50s, The Ballad of Narayama. It depicted ubasute (å§¥æ ¨, "abandoning an old woman"), a custom allegedly practiced in Japan in the distant past, whereby an infirm or elderly relative was carried up a mountain or to some other remote, desolate place and left there to die. While not as straightforward, the last 20 years of policy choices are producing results that are going to feel to the elderly as if they have been abandoned. It's just a much more protracted approach and one that is not so personally intimate as that depicted in the movie.  Gentlemen, They Offer Us Their Flank My friend the serious raconteur Bill Bonner tells the story of the Battle of the Marne in   WWI, relating it to inflation. Quoting (with a few edits): What's remarkable about inflation is that there is so little of it. It makes us think this [inflation/deflation] story may have a twist. You remember the famous German general von Kluck, from whom we get the expression, "You dumb kluck"?Von Kluck was chasing the French down the Marne in 1914. Victory appeared close at hand; the French were pulling back. Von Kluck, who had orders to attack Paris, decided instead to pursue the French army. He was convinced they were beaten.All he had to do was keep the pressure on ... and they would surrender.Some of his field commanders, however, noted that they were picking up very few prisoners. Normally, an army that is beaten throws off many discouraged and confused soldiers. Since there were so few, the commanders reasoned that the French army was still intact; it was merely retreating in good order and could turn and surprise the Germans at any time.The commanders were right. France's aging general, Gallieni, who was in charge of the Paris garrison, realized that the Germans were making a fatal mistake. By pursuing the troops down the Marne, rather than attacking Paris, they exposed themselves to a counterattack from the city itself."Gentlemen," he is said to have remarked to his staff, "They offer us their flank."The French accepted the offer: they attacked. Using thousands of taxicabs, they quickly moved troops to the Marne Valley and caught the Germans unprepared. The Battle of the Marne turned the German army around and ultimately cost them the war. Banzai! Banzai! Banzai! The Japanese are charging the deflationary battle lines, crying "Banzai!" This attack is all or nothing. I think the Japanese are offering us investors their flank. This week’s action in the markets showed us that this battle will not be one-sided. It will often get ugly. But I want to keep reiterating what I have been saying for a long time: shorting the Japanese government is the trade of the decade. That is the largest position in my personal portfolio, and it is going to get larger, as I intend to fully swap the mortgage I just took out this week into yen. As I said to Tom Keene this morning, it is my intention (more accurately styled as hope) to let Abe-san and Kuroda-san pay for a large chunk of my new apartment through their policy of destroying the yen. I have to admit to feeling good when the yen backs up like it has this week, since that gives me a chance to get my trade on at a better entry. Will I succeed? Time will tell, but I am joined by Japanese public pension funds that have announced they will reduce their holdings of local bonds while increasing their share of both domestic and, in particular, foreign equities. No time frame was provided in the data I saw, although indications are that they have already started. (Hat tip Kiron Sarkar.)        It is time to close this week’s letter, but these are topics we'll need to return to. But before we go, I want to include one more table I came across while researching this topic. It is a comparison of the dependency ratio among developed countries. This is the ratio of retired and people under 16 compared to the work force. As it turns out, Japan is not in last place. France, Italy, and Hungary have worse demographics. This chart fairly screams for an entire future letter.  The Strategic Investment Conference Videos The first group of videos from the 2013 Strategic Investment Conference is now available!

I finally closed on my mortgage on the new apartments, and construction to turn them into one apartment begins Monday. I will at last move out of the hotel and into a temporary place next week, although given my schedule for the next few weeks, I will not be home until July to enjoy it. I go to Monaco in about ten days for a speech at GAIM, then I have a few days off before I go to Nicosia, Cyprus, where I am beginning to schedule meetings and may deliver a public speech at the university there. Then I will overnight in some spot on my way to the coast of Croatia, where I will spend the weekend with that brilliant and wicked-funny Irish economist David McWilliams and his family before dashing off to Geneva and then returning home. It is time to hit the send button. I had to get up at 3:30 AM Texas time to be with Tom Keene (I am not sure there is another man I would do that for), and it is now officially a very, very, very long day. It has been a good week, although having to have make-up applied every morning for four straight days has given me additional sympathy for the distaff side of the human race. When was the last time you talked to strangers (or your daughters) about toner color and blending a base foundation? The world has taken me through far different turns than I once imagined it ever would. But it is all fun.

Flickr/Mary Kay GThe most closely followed economic report in the world is arguably the Bureau of Labor Statistics' employment situation report, aka the jobs report. On Friday, the monthly jobs report told us that U.S. companies added 175,00 new jobs and the unemployment rate ticked up to 7.6%. Markets move and policymakers mobilize on this report, which contains what amounts to be pretty inaccurate numbers. In his new US Economics Weekly report, Deutsche Bank's Joe LaVorgna reminds his clients that the jobs report gets revised many times. Substantial revisions are the norm rather than the exception. The monthly nonfarm payroll figures are revised at least seven times. It happens twice in the two months immediately following the initial release and then once every year during the annual benchmark revision, which extends back five years. This means the final results often look very different from what was initially reported. We have found that the average monthly revision to nonfarm payrolls without respect to sign has historically averaged 90k. Additionally, a one standard deviation move from the initially reported number and the final payroll figure is 113k. These are substantial differences, especially considering the fact that financial markets often react to surprises which are often much smaller relative to the consensus forecast. In the chart below, we show the current change in nonfarm payrolls compared to its initially reported value. "As a general rule of thumb, payroll revisions tend to be upward during economic recoveries/expansions and downward during economic recessions," added LaVorgna. "Since the economy grows much more often than it declines, revisions on balance are positive." Deutsche Bank
Reuters/China DailyThe latest batch of economic data from China suggest that growth continues to be sluggish.  Let's walk through each of them.  First, industrial production climbed 9.2% on the year, slightly below expectations for a 9.4% rise. Industrial production in May was led by heavy industries, with steel products up 11.3% year-over-year (YoY), up from 8.1% in April. Auto production slowed to 15.7%, from 18.3%, according to Bank of America's Ting Lu.  Second, fixed asset investment (FAI) was up 19.9% on the year, and year-to-date FAI was up 20.4% on the slightly below expectations for a 20.5% gain. Remember FAI is a good gauge of a country's investment activity.  A breakdown of FAI activity showed that manufacturing FAI eased to 16.5%, from 17.9% because of "sluggish" external demand. Railway FAI slowed significantly to 24.2% YoY, from 62% in April. But year-to-date railway FAI was up 24.5%, compared with -41.6% last year for the same period. Planned investment, which is a leading indicator of FAI eased to 15.4%, from 17.9%. And finally, property FAI fell to 19.4%, from 23.2% the previous month.  For the month of May, Lu writes that the 2.9% fall in producer prices could cause real FAI to rise a bit.  Third, retail sales climbed 12.9% on the year, in line with expectations. Industries impacted by the government's crackdown on corruption, like the restaurant industry saw revenue rise 9.2%, from 7.9% in April. Gold and jewelry sales were up 38.4% because of weakness in gold prices.  Fourth, consumer prices were up 2.1% and producer prices fell 2.9%. What does all of this mean? Lu writes that the latest data suggests that Q2 GDP growth will be 7.6 - 7.7%, and quarter-over-quarter growth should be 1.8%.  But the government, that is looking for about 7.5% growth for 2013, is unlikely to announce new stimulus and is expected "maintain the current accommodative fiscal and monetary policy."
BRIDGEWATER, N.J. (AP) â€” A series of unorthodox decisions by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie points to a simple political calculation for a potential presidential campaign: long-term gain beats short-term pain. Christie last week refused to appoint a fellow Republican to complete the full 17 months of the late Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg's term. Instead the governor scheduled a special election for October and named the state's attorney general, Republican Jeff Chiesa, to serve in the interim. A week earlier, he made his second post-Superstorm Sandy appearance with President Barack Obama along the Jersey shore. Last summer, Christie's keynote address at the Republican National Convention focused heavily on his own record instead of the party's nominee, Mitt Romney. In each case, the Republican reaction has ranged from sharp criticism in public to muted carping in private, with insiders suggesting that Christie is proving himself to be a shrewd politician who puts his own political career first over his party's needs. Republican Dick Armey, a former U.S. House majority leader from Texas, said Christie's Senate race decision was "debilitating stupidity." The complaints are remarkably reminiscent of Democrats' concerns with Obama over the years. Not that Christie seems to care about the gripes. "There's no political purpose. The political purpose is to give the people a voice," he said last week, shrugging off GOP criticism from Capitol Hill over the Senate election schedule. All this came just a few months after Christie disclosed that he had undergone secret weight-loss surgery, which addressing both a political and health vulnerability, just days after lashing out against critics of his weight. Christie has shown he's willing to take some heat from fellow Republicans now for actions that could benefit him in the future, perhaps for a 2016 presidential campaign. Outside of Obama, few other political leaders can command attention like Christie, and he has used it forge a bipartisan, tell-it-like-it-is reputation that has helped him generate high approval ratings during his first term and bolster his re-election chances. Christie's approach, however, carries some risk. He could alienate the very Republicans he would need to win a presidential primary campaign, when the electorate is filled with conservative stalwarts who don't look kindly on working across the aisle. These high-profile moments create the impression among Republican donors and insiders that Christie's own political self-interest trumps the needs of the party. "He's playing the long game," said Hank Sheinkopf, a New York-based Democratic strategist. He suggested that Christie's crossover appeal could make him a formidable figure but Republicans might not be as forgiving if the governor's re-election campaign fails to produce a sweeping victory. "He has to hope that his numbers are so high in the fall that it offsets anger from national Republicans," Sheinkopf said. "It doesn't injure him if he wins very big and wins big with Democrats. If not, then his brand is tarnished." Christie's defenders say he was a loyal soldier to Romney during the campaign and simply put his state first after Sandy struck. They say that a quick Senate special election was in the state's best interests and that he's focused on his re-election race, not 2016. Even so, Christie seems to be betting that a landslide victory against state Sen. Barbara Buono, a relatively unknown opponent in Democratic-tilting New Jersey, will help him make the case that if Christie does run for the White House, he has the ability to reach a diverse set of voters. A big victory in New Jersey could help him argue that he could reach women, Latinos and black voters, who have flocked to Obama, and untangle Washington's gridlock after Obama's two terms. "What we want to do is to create a whole new coalition, not just of Republicans but of independents and of right-thinking Democrats," Christie said Tuesday during a GOP primary night party in Bridgewater. "Not just of people in the suburbs but of people in the cities. Not just of people of wealth but of people who aspire to wealth. We can do it together and we will do it together." In the week ahead, Christie is scheduled to hold events that underscore his ability to reach voters outside the typical Republican electorate, unlike Romney, who struggled to win over non-white voters. Friday will offer a telling contrast. While a group of potential GOP presidential contenders court evangelicals at Ralph Reed's Faith and Freedom Coalition conference, Christie will attend the Clinton Global Initiative America meeting in Chicago with former President Bill Clinton, creating images that can only enhance his standing with moderate voters and Democrats back home. That appearance is all but certain to further irk Republicans. Many were annoyed by Christie's decision to call for a special election in October to fill Lautenberg's Senate seat, even though the governor goes before voters three weeks later. The move helped Christie avoid being on the same ballot as Newark Mayor Cory Booker, the likely Democratic Senate nominee who could compel his party to turn out and weaken Christie's vote totals, and it could help Republicans campaigning for seats in the Legislature. Republicans had hoped to have another vote in the Senate until November 2014 but Christie's decision left Republicans scrambling to find a candidate in a compressed time period. Chiesa will be a placeholder until October. When asked about the special election's $24 million cost, Christie said he didn't know the cost "and I quite frankly, don't care." Kentucky's Mitch McConnell, the top Republican in the U.S. Senate, begged off pointed criticism, saying he wouldn't "question the path that he has chosen." But some conservatives teed off more directly on Christie, with Rush Limbaugh suggesting the governor might seek the Democratic nomination for president. "You talk about slap in the face," Limbaugh said. Christie defended his decision, saying holding the election at a later date would have generated lawsuits from Democrats and voters should have a "voice and choice" on their next senator. "I will not permit the insiders and a few party elites to determine who the nominee of the Republican party and the Democratic party will be," he said. ___ Follow Ken Thomas at http://www.twitter.com/AP_Ken_Thomas Copyright (2013) Associated Press.

IMDB / Warner Bros.The Perfect StormBMO Capital's Brian Belski has increasingly sounded alarms as the stock market blew past his once-bullish targets. In his latest note to clients, Belski reiterates his thesis that the big investors are only buying into this rally now because they've been missing out. He believes this will only make things worse for everyone else should things turn south in a big way. "[W]e continue to believe that most institutional investors are not prepared for a potential period of market weakness," wrote Belski. "Therefore, we believe investors should prepare for more back-and-forth action this summer -- not just up and not just down -- as the market sifts through what is likely to be choppy fundamental and economic data in the coming months." Here's more from Belski: The VIX Index is up almost 5 points since mid-May. We believe one of the primary reasons is that economic data have been increasingly disappointing lately. Our analysis shows that periods of decelerating economic data typically coincide with periods of and higher market volatility, which in turn usually equates to poor stock market performance. For instance, we found that the average annual return of the S&amp;P 500 is significantly weaker during periods of increasing VIX levels, particularly during the period where it increases toward its longerterm average of roughly 20 since 1990. BMO Capital "[G]iven all of the above, the market is likely stuck in a frustrated and choppy trading range for at least several more months, unless the economic environment (and job growth in particular) begins to pick up more steam and quick," said Belski. "As a result, investors should continue to employ stock picking strategies relative to more passive or indexing strategies." Belski continues to have a 1,575 year-end target for the S&amp;P 500.
andrew mace-- via flickrMore than half the global population lives in cities, according to a new report from Citi and the Economist Intelligence Unit. And they account for 80% of GDP. In the next 30 years, nearly all growth is expected to come from cities. Cities in North America and Europe will continue to be the world's most competitive till 2025. But major cities in emerging markets like Brazil to India boosted their global competitiveness. A few major takeaways from the report: The report takes into account metrics like economic growth, human capital, financial maturity, and global appeal. We've picked out a few key categories from the report to highlight the world's most competitive cities.
