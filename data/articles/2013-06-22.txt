REUTERS/Jason ReedThe most important story in the world is the change of direction in U.S. interest rates, which coincides with the change in tone out of the Federal Reserve. On Wednesday the Fed indicated that so long as its economic projections come to pass, it plans to slow down on Quantitative Easing later this year, with an eye towards totally ceasing bond purchases sometime in 2014. The markets puked on the news, and interest rates shot up, a move that was exacerbated by Bernanke himself saying he was not worried about the rise in rates. According to Paul Krugman, it's possible this will end up as a "historic" mistake. If the economy recovers, then fine, whatever, the Fed will get away with it. But let's say things sputter out again, and it becomes clear that more easing is necessary. Sure, the Fed can ramp back up QE, and step on the gas pedal again. And the Fed has indicated that it retains this ability. The problem though is that by acting like a traditionally responsible central bank (trying to avoid inflation and bubbles pre-emptively) it can no longer commit to being irresponsible, which is what many have argued is necessary to truly avoid a deflation trap. There's a widespread belief that what's needed is for the Fed to somehow signal that even if inflation runs hot, that it won't step off the pedal until the economy is at full potential output again. By acting pre-emptively just when things seem to be OK, the Fed has blown that tool. Says Krugman: So what if recovery stalls, and inflation expectations fall even further? Can the Fed turn on a dime, and send a credible message that it really isnâ€™t so conventional-minded, after all? Itâ€™s hard to believe; having already shown itself inclined to start snatching away the punch bowl before the party even starts, it has arguably already given away the game. I know that the latest had overwhelming support on the FOMC; Iâ€™m surprised and a bit shocked by that, and worry that we may have seen incestuous amplification at work. I really hope that the real economy recovers at a pace that makes my fears groundless. But if it doesnâ€™t, I fear that the Fed has just done more damage than it seems to realize.

May monthly data reported this past week included the Index of Leading Indicators, up 0.1 and showing no imminent recession, the Empire State and Philly manufacturing indexes, both of which improved, consumer prices up slightly, housing starts and existing home sales up, and permits down. The 6 month trend in housing is up, but at a more muted pace than over the previous year.  Prof. Geoffrey Moore identified 4 long leading indicators, which take over a year to feed into the general economy: bond interest rates, real M2 money supply, housing permits, and corporate profits after taxes. Three of the four (using purchase mortgage applications as a reasonable proxy for permits) are updated in our look at the high frequency weekly indicators, so let's start with them: Interest rates and credit spreads     Interest rates for corporate bonds had generally been falling since being just above 6% in January 2011, hitting a low of 4.46% in November 2012. Treasuries previously were at a 2.4% high in late 2011, falling to a low of 1.47% in July 2012, but in the last few days have retreated back to that high. Spreads have varied between a high over 3.4% in June 2011 to a low under 2.75% in October 2012. After being close to that low 6 weeks ago, interest rates have backed up significantly. Housing metrics  Mortgage applications from the Mortgage Bankers Association:     Refinancing applications have decreased sharply in the last month due to higher interest rates. Purchase applications have also declined, although they continue their slightly rising YoY trend established earlier this year. Housing prices Housing prices bottomed at the end of November 2011 on Housing Tracker, and averaged an increase of +2.0% to +2.5% YoY during 2012. This week's YoY increase made yet another 6 year record.  Real estate loans, from the FRB H8 report:     Loans turned up at the end of 2011 and averaged about 1% gains YoY through most of 2012.  In the last several months the comparisons have completely stalled, although this week was positive. Money supply M1     M2     Real M1 made a YoY high of about 20% in January 2012 and had generally been easing off since, but recently has increased again.  Real M2 also made a YoY high of about 10.5% in January 2012.  Its subsequent low was 4.5% in August 2012. It increased slightly in the first few months of this year and has stabilized since. Employment metrics American Staffing AssociationIndex Initial jobless claims   Tax Withholding   In the 6 weeks month, the ASA has deteriorated to being negative compared with last year. After having a great 20-day comparison several weeks ago, for the third time in a row this week tax withholding had a relatively poor YoY comparison. Initial claims remain within their recent range of between 325,000 to 375,000, and have flattened out just as they have in the last 3 springs and summers. Transport Railroad transport from the AAR       Shipping transport   Rail transport has been both positive and negative YoY in the last several months. This week it was positive. The Harpex index has been improving slowly from its January 1 low of 352. The Baltic Dry Index increased sharply this week and is close to a 52 week high. Consumer spending     Gallup's YoY comparisons remain extremely positive, as they have been for the last half a year.  The ICSC varied between +1.5% and +4.5% YoY in 2012, while Johnson Redbook was generally below +3%. The ICSC has trended towards the lower part of its range recently, but Johnson Redbook has been close to the high end of its range. Oil prices and usage     The price of a gallon of gas, after declining sharply in March and April, rose again in May, steadied in early June, and has declined for the last week. The 4 week average for gas usage remained slightly negative. Bank lending rates   The TED spread is still near the low end of its 3 year range.  LIBOR rose slightly from its new 3 year low established last week. JoC ECRI Commodity prices   Noteworthy this week is the continuing spike in interest rates, as well as the decline in mortgage activity. Both of these are long leading indicators and so raise a warning flag for next year. The third long leading indicator, however, real money supply remains positive. The only other outright negative indicator is temporary staffing, which has been problematic for over a month.  Positives included strong consumer spending once again. More positives included house prices, YoY purchase mortgage applications, overnight bank rates, both rail and shipping transport, and gas prices. Jobless claims and commodity prices rate as neutrals this week.  The sharp rise in interest rates is definitely of concern, but it hasn't lasted long enough to seriously signal a recession next year. Housing is weakening but still positive. In terms of coincident indicators of the economy, consumer spending is still quite positive, and initial jobless claims, while trending sideways for the last month or so, show no signs of rolling over.  Have a nice weekend.
Fasten your seatbelts. And expect lots of turbulence. If that was the message Ben Bernanke was trying to deliver when he said the Federal Reserve could soon start scaling back its massive stimulus program for the U.S. economy, it's safe to say investors received it loud and clear. In fact, the sell-off in stocks, bonds and commodities that rippled around the globe after Bernanke's remarks looks to some like the dawn of a new period of volatile, disorderly trade - a stark change from the calm that prevailed since the Fed began its most recent bond-buying program last autumn. "When market regimes shift, they rarely do so in an orderly fashion - look at equity prices collapsing at the end of the dot-com bubble or the height of the financial crisis," said Stephen Sachs, head of capital markets at exchange-traded fund issuer ProShares in Bethesda, Maryland. "It usually gets violent. We're going to face that in interest rates now." Indeed, the bond market is at the epicenter of the financial market earthquake that Bernanke unleashed. Benchmark yields, which Fed easing had driven to record lows, surged to near two-year highs and are expected to keep climbing as traders come to grips with the prospect of the Fed ending bond purchases by mid-2014. The aftershocks have rattled markets from Tokyo to Sao Paulo, and assets that had been top performers plunged. U.S. credit markets were hammered, with the gap between junk bond yields and Treasuries hitting their widest so far this year, while global equity markets lost $1 trillion on Thursday alone. The brute force of the decline caught some by surprise, since Bernanke warned in late May that the Fed could slow its bond buying later this year. Even so, watching long-term interest rates rise 0.4 percentage points for the week - the biggest move in more than 10 years - after trading for months near record lows was a wake-up call. "People live in denial all the time," said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at investment management firm Fort Pitt Capital in Pittsburgh. "The thinking part of people's brains understood that rates would have to go up sometime. But they weren't ready to be told that reality starts now." That goes for companies who now face higher funding costs and investors who had borrowed money cheaply to trade. Investors had been funding trades in riskier markets by borrowing in the stable, low-interest-rate U.S. debt market. But the cost to borrow rises with higher rates and with increased volatility - both of which appear to be here to stay, at least for now. Dan Fuss, vice chairman of investment management firm Loomis Sayles &amp; Co, which manages $191 billion in funds, said: "Leverage is coming out of the market. These market moves reflect that, but when you get sharp moves like this a lot of people get nervous. That can contribute to more selling." Bond investors hoping to play "follow the Fed" forever face an even more frightening reality. As Zane Brown, a fixed income strategist at asset manager Lord Abbett &amp; Co noted, a return to a more normal level of interest rates would result in a zero total return over the next five years for investors benchmarked to the popular Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index. Investors pulled $15.1 billion out of taxable bond funds in the first three weeks of June, according to Lipper, a Thomson Reuters service. That is the biggest three-week outflow from the funds since October 2008, at the height of the financial crisis. "HYPER-SENSITIVE" All of this has left traders and investors scrambling to protect themselves in anticipation of a volatile summer. Trading in interest-rate futures contracts spiked to a record in late May when Bernanke first broached the subject of winding down stimulus. It soared again this week, when some 12.8 million contracts changed hands on Thursday, according to CME Group, well above May's daily average of 7.9 million. Volume in S&amp;P 500 index options rose to 2.3 million contracts on Thursday, a new one-day record, while overall options volume of 33.3 million contracts made it the busiest day since Aug. 9, 2011, four days after Standard &amp; Poor's stripped the United States of its top credit rating. Since Bernanke has insisted that winding down bond purchases depends on continued economic improvement, traders now have to assume nearly every economic data release will have the potential to whipsaw financial markets. "Across the board, we have seen people paying up for insurance in the options market," said J.J. Kinahan, chief strategist at online brokerage firm TD Ameritrade. "The market is going to be hyper-sensitive to anything that the Fed says, and the three major reports on employment, retail sales and housing will continue to dominate the eyes of the market." The CBOE Volatility Index, a gauge of anxiety on Wall Street, jumped 23 percent on Thursday to 20.49, the first time this year it has exceeded 20, an often-used dividing line between calm and stressed markets. It closed at 18.90 on Friday. Signs of concern about high-flying assets like emerging markets can be seen in the options market, where more than 1.35 million contracts in the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets exchange-traded fund traded on Thursday - 82 percent of which were put options, generally used to protect against losses. The Merrill Lynch MOVE Index, a measure of expected volatility in the U.S. Treasury market, rose to 103.7 on Friday; that index sat at 50 in early May, a multi-year low. The uncertainty the Fed has sowed by telling markets they are on their own means the days of almost uninterrupted gains that have prevailed since late last year are over. And that brings problems of its own for investors and the market. For one thing, violent price swings make investors more vulnerable to big losses, prompting them to sell assets simply to reduce their value-at-risk (VaR) levels, a statistical method for quantifying portfolio risk over a given period of time. Rack up enough of these forced liquidations and it is not hard to see how a sell-off in one market can spread quickly to other assets and other parts of the world. Bob Lynch, head of G10 FX strategy at HSBC, said this was a factor driving the bond and equity sell-off in late May "and could be an important input driving financial assets lower in the current environment." "It is too early to tell if the market reaction to the Fed is just noise or the beginning of a greater sell-off in U.S. equities," said Mike Tosaw, portfolio manager at RCM Wealth Advisors, an investment advisory firm in Chicago. "Over the course of the last month, we have been taking money off the table in the stock market and keeping the cash for the time being. Early next week, we plan to evaluate if this is a buying opportunity in stocks or if we need to run for the hills."

Here's a great chart from SoberLook showing how fixed income assets — which for many investors are viewed as the "safe" part of their portfolio, have just gotten murdered this month. SoberLook The chart was brought to our attention by @fullcarry on Twitter, who made this observation yesterday in regards to the fixed income selloff in the wake of the Fed's Wednesday announcement. This reaction actually justifies what the Fed did. This week the Fed made only vague hints about tightening (really not much new) at yet these assets got utterly smoked, which is a strong indication that the love for fixed income assets was getting out of control. The Fed reminded everyone that "safe" is not necessarily so fare. If the economy stays humming, and the Fed can inject some caution into markets, that will be a big win. We'll see how it goes.
antwerpenR via flickr Creative CommonsThe U.S. has finally charged former Booz Allen employee Edward Snowden with espionage for leaking U.S. intelligence documents and secrets. But that doesn't mean the U.S. is close to apprehending him. Snowden remains a free man in Hong Kong, Lana Lam of the South China Morning Post is reporting. And, while he hangs out in a "safe place," Snowden is now sharing more U.S. intelligence secrets with the Chinese (and world) through the South China Morning Post. According to the SCMP, Snowden has documents showing how the U.S. has systematically targeted and hacked computers in Hong Kong and mainland China. These attacks included: Although it's probably healthy for Americans to be reminded that their government does many of the same things that people accuse China of doing, it's hard to argue that these new leaks help America. When he first revealed himself as the National Security Agency leaker two weeks ago, Snowden cast himself as an American patriot. Americans needed to know what their government was up to, Snowden suggested, because, in Snowden's view, the privacy rights of Americans were being violated. In the weeks since revealing himself, however, Snowden's moves have suggested that his actions aren't motivated by loyalty to his country, but, instead, by a personal view of how the world should work. By explaining to the Chinese how the U.S. is hacking their computers, and revealing that the U.S. spied on world leaders at a G20 summit, Snowden is making clear that he is basically against spying of any kind. By giving U.S. secrets to the Chinese, Snowden is also, presumably, looking out for himself. If he can prove his value to the Chinese government, presumably, Snowden will increase the chance that the Chinese government will refuse to extradite him. While some people will no doubt agree with Snowden's idealistic view of the world, others will justifiably regard it as an extreme position that doesn't take into account reality. And Snowden's recent actions, which, if nothing else, will embarrass the United States, hurt Snowden's case that he's an American hero and that "anyone" would have done what he did after discovering how the U.S. was trampling on basic privacy rights. In short, Snowden is gradually destroying the initial support he had built up among Americans. And a majority of Americans now want him thrown in jail.

Carla Dauden, YouTube The big new story of the past week: Brazil erupted in protest. By the end of the week, as many as 2 million people may have come out. Ostensibly the protest was about a hike in bus fare, but it was actually about a lot more. Carla Dauden is a film director, and director of photography, who made a short six-minute video titled No, I'm Not Going To The World Cup, to explain what's really happening in the country where she was born. In it she explains that everyone she meets tells here that they're going to go to next year's World Cup, and that when people talk about Brazil, they usually hit on a few stereotypes, like Brazil's attractive people, its love of soccer, and how everyone loves to dance. Carla Dauden, YouTube But the reality is that Brazil has serious social infrastructure and public service problems, and it's hard to justify the enormous expense on The World Cup. Carla Dauden, YouTube And that's just the start of the frustration. Watch the whole video to grasp the entire situation.  (via Beyond Brics)
REUTERS/Jason LeeAll the chatter in China this week has been about a credit crunch in China. On Thursday, the SHIBOR, or Shanghai Interbank Offered Rate, the benchmark interest rate used in lending activities between banks,Â  surged to 13.44%. The overnight repo rate hit 25%.Â  After the central bank reportedly intervened with targeted injection of 50 billion yuan into the market, interbank rates fell from their highs on Friday, but nevertheless remained at elevated levels. But how concerned should we be about the rise in interbank rates? In terms of markets, SHIBOR might not be as important as interbank rates of developed markets, Morgan Stanley's Richard Xu wrote in a research note on Thursday. He pointed out that the total balance of both official interbank lending and over the counter interbank lending, in which rates are directly affected by SHIBOR, represents only around 8% of total bank assets. Â SHIBOR's impact on the real economy is also limited.Â  "We estimate that rates of ~12% on credits to the real economy (such as discounted bill rates) are more directly affected by SHIBOR. The rest â€“ including loans, corporate bonds and interbank NSCA â€“ are affected in a milder way. Despite the 150â€“300bps surge in SHIBOR this month, rates on the aforementioned types of credit increased ~20â€“80bps during the same period." In an excellent piece, FT Alphaville's Kate Mackenzie writes the Chinese central bank has been talking about controlling risks in the banking sector for some time. A meeting of China's State Council saw top policymakers emphasize that the financial system needs reform and that credit should be channeled towards industries with that could drive economic growth. From Mackeznie: "It all suggests this is a very deliberate move to direct Chinaâ€™s credit into more effective investments â€” things that will actually make some kind of return, rather than requiring debt rollovers and the like." We have previously reported that the central bank seems committed to "punishing" banks that had taken advantage of stable interbank rates to fund their purchase of higher-yield bonds. In other words, much of this is calculated, even if the silence on the part of the PBoC has everyone on edge. For now there hasn't been a bank run at the retail investor level, according to Credit Suisse's Dong Tao. Large state owned enterprises are still flush with cash, though smaller businesses are "struggling with liquidity." Tao thinks Shibor has peaked though rates will remain elevated. He also thinks the duration of these elevated rates are more important than the rate spikes. "The longer this lasts, the more likely that some banks may face serious liquidityÂ  issues and that would further undermine the creditability between banks, creating a chain reaction," he wrote. "It is our view that draining interbank liquidity at the interbank market could cause unintended consequences, at a time at which duration and risk mismatch among the banks are severe, account receivables in the corporate sector are surging, and the inflow of FX reserves is decelerating sharply." So, there definitely is good reason to be worried about risks in China's financial system, and the spiking interbank rates definitely point to a liquidity squeeze. But this suggests that comments in recent days comparing the surge in SHIBOR to the spike in rates in the run up to the Lehman crisis, were overstated.
For years, North Korea has been crushed by a communist command economy producing little besides mass starvation. More recently, the plight of North Korea’s economy has been exacerbated by harsh, foreign economic sanctions – which only seem to have driven the regime to double down on its nuclear ambitions.  Following North Korean supreme leader Kim Jong-il’s death in December 2011, many around the world had high hopes that his successor (and son), Kim Jong-un, would launch economic and political reforms. Unfortunately, in the year and a half since he assumed power, the new supreme leader has not delivered on his advertised economic reforms, and misery continues to grip all but those in North Korea’s communist upper class.  During the past few months, North Korea has been the subject of outsized news coverage. The recent peacocking by the Supreme Leader – from domestic martial law policies to tests of the country’s nuclear weapons capabilities – has successfully distracted the media from North Korea’s economic woes. Indeed, behind the saber-rattling, the missile tests, and the basketball games with Dennis Rodman, is an economic story – one with important geopolitical implications, not only for North Korea, but also for China. North Korea’s Hyperinflation  For years, North Korea’s currency, the won, has been officially pegged to the U.S. dollar. That said, exchange controls and a plethora of associated regulations and harsh penalties have rendered the won inconvertible. This, of course, has given rise to a healthy black market for foreign currency. North Korea’s monetary dysfunction has been accompanied by severe inflation problems.  In 2009, the North Korean government attempted to address these problems by implementing a phony currency “reform” program, which it promptly bungled. The so-called reform was actually just a currency redenomination program, which arbitrarily lopped two zeros off every won note. North Koreans were given less than two weeks to exchange all of their won for new notes. And, the government set limits on the quantity of old won a family could exchange for new won. For those North Koreans who had saved a few too many won, the redenomination program was effectively a wealth tax program, too.  It should come as little surprise that Pyongyang’s bungled currency reform sparked a panic in North Korea’s primitive, underground markets for goods and services. These markets, which developed out of necessity during the famine of the 1990s, primarily exist to counteract shortages that result from state control of agriculture. Indeed, the United Nations has estimated that 50% of the calories consumed by North Koreans come from food purchased in these underground markets. The price of rice, for example, promptly skyrocketed during this period (see the accompanying chart).   Daily NK To gauge the inflation temperature in cases such as North Korea’s, we must obtain black-market exchange-rate data. Black-market exchange rate data for the won are collected by Daily NK, a Seoul-based news service. With the bungled currency reform, the demand for hard currency accelerated, as more and more merchants in the underground markets required transactions to be conducted in hard currency. In consequence, the value of the won plummeted on the black market (see the accompanying chart). Daily NK So, what happened to the overall price level in North Korea in the wake of the currency reform? Well, black-market exchange rate data allow us to reach a reliable estimate of North Korea’s inflation rate. As the accompanying chart shows, the 2009 panic sparked an inflation surge in North Korea. Daily NK As the chart illustrates, the inflation rate implied by the change in the black-market exchange rate proves quite accurate, as it tracks closely with the inflation rate implied by changes in the price of rice. Thus, we can conclude that the inflation crisis that began in 2009 quickly accelerated into hyperinflation, which occurs when the monthly inflation rate exceeds 50%. It was not until mid-January 2011 that North Korea’s hyperinflation episode finally came to an end (see the accompanying table).  Daily NK During the hyperinflation period, many North Korean consumers began to exchange their ever-depreciating won for more stable foreign currencies, such as the Chinese yuan and the U.S. dollar, in a desperate attempt to preserve their wealth and purchasing power. Although North Korea is no longer experiencing hyperinflation, elevated rates of inflation continue to plague the country’s economy. Indeed, I estimate that North Korea experienced an annual inflation rate of 116% in 2012. As a result, the won’s popularity continues to decline. North Korea’s “Dollarization” It is not surprising, therefore, that the Chinese yuan and U.S. dollar are now being used more widely in North Korea than the won. According to Daily NK, North Korean markets along the Chinese border now conduct approximately 80% of their transactions in Chinese yuan. Markets farther from the border are said to conduct approximately 50% of their transactions in U.S. dollars. This confirms that North Korea is experiencing a phenomenon that goes hand-in-glove with elevated inflation – “spontaneous dollarization.” This phenomenon of voluntarily dumping the domestic currency in favor of a stable foreign currency (not necessarily the U.S. dollar), has been widespread in recent years, despite the fact that Pyongyang has criminalized the circulation of foreign currencies on the black market. After years of runaway inflation, many have simply lost faith in the North Korean currency. North Korean workers involved in trade with China typically request their pay in Chinese yuan. And, when a foreign currency isn’t available, a commodity will do. One of the more curious examples of this can be found in the Kaesong Industrial Complex, which until recently was jointly operated by North and South Korea. For a time, workers used a South Korean marshmallow cookie treat, the ChocoPie, as sort of unofficial currency within the complex. The dollar “exchange rate” for a ChocoPie (which costs about 25 cents in South Korea) reached nearly $10 in Kaesong before management ceased giving workers their bonuses in ChocoPies. This should be “déjà vu all over again” for anyone who has read R.A. Radford’s 1945 classic, “The Economic Organisation of a P.O.W. Camp.” So, the North Koreans are proceeding down the path to dollarization, as people often have in other inflation-ravaged countries, such as Zimbabwe. In mid-November 2008, Zimbabwe’s hyperinflation reached an annual rate of 89.7 sextillion percent – that’s roughly 9 followed by 22 zeros. Finally, after over a year and a half of hyperinflation, the people of Zimbabwe simply abandoned the Zimbabwe dollar and began to exclusively use the U.S. dollar and a smattering of other currencies from neighboring countries, such as the South African Rand, the Botswanan pula, the Mozambican metical and the Zambian kwacha. This brought an immediate end to Zimbabwe’s hyperinflation, and inflation rates quickly returned to single digits. Shortly after this “spontaneous dollarization” of the economy, the Mugabe government was forced to accept the demise of the Zimbabwe dollar and officially dollarize the economy. Although North Korea’s hyperinflation is dwarfed by that of Zimbabwe (the second-worst in history), the example of Robert Mugabe’s Zimbabwe is telling. If spontaneous dollarization and the official acceptance of that reality can occur in Zimbabwe, it can occur anywhere.   “Yuan-izing” North Korea For the time being, it is doubtful that the North Korean government will allow the use of foreign currency, let alone officially dollarize the North Korean economy. That said, in much of North Korea – particularly in areas near the Chinese border – unofficial, spontaneous dollarization is already a reality. Perhaps the official use of the U.S. dollar is out of the question, but it is clear that the North Korean economy and currency are dysfunctional. So, why not yuan-ize the North Korean economy?  Far Fetched? Not really. After all, it is estimated that China accounts for more than half of North Korea’s foreign trade and the lion’s share of its foreign direct investment. Although the Jinping regime publically expresses disapproval of North Korea’s belligerent antics, China continues to increase its trade and investments in North Korea. More importantly, China continues to develop the region along its border with North Korea, working around the clock to build bridges, highways, power links, and high-speed rail lines in China’s northeast. Regardless of the rhetoric coming out of Beijing, China is clearly pursuing a regional development and economic integration strategy, centered on establishing sea access via the North Korean port of Rason.  The official adoption of the yuan by North Korea would certainly be a boon for China, but what about North Korea? Well, for starters, yuan-ization would put an end to North Korea’s inflation woes, at least creating the potential for domestic economic growth. It would also facilitate increased trade with China and perhaps other countries, as well.   This would seem to run counter to the current U.S. policy stance against North Korea. But, consider the efficacy of sanctions against North Korea thus far. The North Korean regime has proved perfectly willing to let its people starve while it pursues nuclear capabilities. There is no evidence that continued elevated inflation will have any sort of destabilizing effect on Kim Jong-un’s regime; just look at Zimbabwe, where Robert Mugabe still holds power years after the country’s hyperinflation crisis.  For China, yuan-ization and economic reforms in North Korea, similar to the ones that China itself is undergoing, would result in a much less combative and dangerous neighbor. No wonder the Chinese are pushing for increased integration of China’s Northeast region and North Korea. Indeed, it is possible that economic integration with a relatively more liberal China might help North Korea’s economy begin to emerge from the stone age, towards something at least resembling a market economy. 
Business Insider / Sam Ro I woke up on a recent Thursday morning and, as usual, I caught up on some news for about an hour, and then jumped in the shower. Like some amateur, I got soap in my eye while washing my face. That sucked. But things only got worse from there. While I was brushing my teeth, toothpaste and spit spilled out of the side of my mouth.Â  And that's when I realized something was seriously wrong. I started making some facial expression in the mirror, and the left side of my face was not moving. I was clearly in shock because my first thought was that the mirror was broken. But as soon as that ridiculous thought left my mind, panic set in as I concluded I must be having a stroke. However, that didn't make any sense either because as far as I could tell, everything else was working fine. Thank god for the the internet, because a google search for "left side of face not moving" yielded a dozens of pages that said this was not a stroke and that this was not the end of the world. But they all said to seek medical attention right away. I paged my doctor and left a message that my face wasn't moving. Immediately, he called back and told me to come in as soon as possible. Business Insider / Sam RoBell's Palsy My doctor and the internet both told me I had Bell's palsy. Bell's palsy is a disorder of the facial nerve, or cranial nerve VII.Â  Damage to this nerve causes weakness and sometimes complete paralysis of the facial muscles. Symptoms start suddenly, but sometimes take two to three days to appear. According to the U.S. National Library of Medicine, around 30,000 to 40,000 Americans get it every year. Almost everyone you'll talk to will tell you that they know or knew someone who had it. George Clooney, Pierce Brosnan, and Carnie Wilson of Wilson Philips are a few famous people who've had it. The causes are unclear. Some believe it's a middle ear infection. Some believe a virus is sometimes involved. It's not life-threatening, which is a good thing. And for most people, it's not permanent. The chief concern is damage to the eye because the eyelids usually don't close all of the way and tear production is affected.Â  My doctor prescribed me with a heavy dose of prednisone (steroids) and valacyclovir (anti-viral) for a week. He also ordered me to get lubricating eye drops to protect my eye. He also referred me to a neurologist, who I saw a week later. Ultimately, they both said I'd just have to give it time. Maybe a month or two before I'd notice some significant improvement. The Reality Food doesn't go in my mouth without hitting my face because my lips don't open all of the way. Food also falls out of my mouth because my lips don't close all of the way. Also, I bite my lips all of the time. It's exactly like when you come back from the dentist and your face is still processing the Novocaine. Except, you can feel everything. But that's not too too bad, because I can afford to lose some weight. My arms, legs, and everything else work fine. I sound really weird when I talk, and I laugh like a pirate. Think Dr. Zoidberg from "Futurama" or Kramer in that one episode of "Seinfeld." Ultimately, things could be a whole lot worse. I still wake up every morning thinking that this whole thing was just some weird nightmare. But for now, my optimism is reinforced by tiny improvements. Here's what my face is doing today, 16 days in. 
4 Rockin G RanchAn investor is selling his awesome ranch outside Boulder, Colorado for $16.9 million, the WSJ reports. There's really no downside on this one. The ranch is called 4 Rockin G Ranch and is 144 acres of gorgeous land with a killer 4 bedroom, 5 bathroom main house. Yes, there's a pool. Yes, there's guest house (and a guest cottage). Yes there are horse stables â€” gym, sauna, we could go on. Bill Fandel of Telluride Sotheby's Realty has the listing.
You may have heard on your car radio or on television last night after you came home from work that the stock market had a bad day, dropping about 2.5%. Probably the newscaster said something about it being a reaction to the Federal Reserve Bank's announcement that it expects to "taper" its purchases of long term bonds in the near future. While the daily gyrtions of the stock market are not worth getting excited about, IF the "taper" happens, it likely will affect you. Let me explain why.  First of all, let's put the stock market decline of the last two days in perspective. Here's a daily graph of the S&amp;P 500 since the beginning of this year: The Bonddad Blog Note that the market rose almost 20% since January 1. Even with the 5% selloff over the last 2 days since Bernanke confirmed that the Fed intends to start "tapering" soon, it is still up over 10% for the year.  While I don't presume to read traders' (or trading computers') minds (see Barry ritholtz' note this morning about ex post facto rationalizations), generally speaking there is concern that the "taper" of long term bond purchases will cause bond yields (the percent of interest paid on them) to rise. When bond yields rise, the market price to purchase or sell those bonds falls. When most traders expect prices to fall in the future, what do they do? They sell the assets now, causing prices to fall immediately, rather than in the future! That's exactly what has happened over the last month, as shown in this graph of the yield on the 10 year US treasury bond for the last year (keep in mind that yields going up means prices going down): FRED This is a sharp move, although as we'll see in the next graph, from a longer-term perspective, it is little more than a blip. That being said, there's a pretty good chance that last summer's low in long term interest rates may be the lowest you will ever have seen in your whole life.  The reason average Americans should care about the "taper" is that higher interest rates on bonds also means higher interest rates on things like mortgages. One of my constant points on this blog for the last several years has been that households' refinancing of their mortgage debt at lower and lower rates has put more money in their pockets for spending and for paying down debt. This next graph is an update of one from Mortgage News Daily that I've run a number of times over the last couple of years, comparing the amount of mortgage refinancing (yellow) with mortgage interest rates (blue): The Bonddad Blog The graph starts in 2008 at the depths of the recession. Note that refinancing was at its low ebb. Since then and especially in late 2011 and 2012, with record low mortgage rates refinancing has boomed. At the far right of the graph you can see the last month's spike in mortgage rates, and the steep decline in refinancing back to mid-2011 levels.  Simply put, the more the "taper" causes interest rates to rise, the less refinancing of mortgages we will see. We'll probably also see a decline in the amount of purchases of new homes as well, since purchasers will also be faced with higher mortgage rates.  And mortgage refinancing has been one of the most important reasons why the economy has continued to move forward in the last few years, despite the stagnation in real wages, which is what is show in this next graph of average hourly wages divided by consumer prices to give us "real hourly wages": FRED Real hourly wages have improved over the last 12 months, but they are still below where they were all through 2009 and 2010.  So average Americans should care about the "taper." To the extent it causes interest rates to rise, interest rates you pay on any new debt are likely to go up. Refinancing of old debt will pretty much vanish. Further, at 7.5% unemployment, it is unlikely that real wages are likely to appreciate significantly, to say the least! Interest sensitive sectors of the economy, like home building, will likely deteriorate. With manufacturing already stagnant, the likelihood of falling into a new recession next year increases greatly (remember that interest rates are a long leading indicator, and increases tend to take a year or more to be felt in the real economy).  Finally, let me point out that in the above analysis, I am being like the Ghost of Christmas Future in "A Christmas Carol." I am not showing you what will be; only what might be. All of those bonds I mentioned above, being sold by traders? Other traders bought every single one. There are some people who think the upward move in interest rates is overdone, and they see a buying opportunity. In other words, there is no certainty that the Fed "taper" will cause interest rates to move higher than they already have. Even more importantly, Bernanke premised the "taper" on unemployment moving to 7% or below. If the economy slows because of anticipated or real higher interest rates, we won't see unemployment moving under 7%, and then the Fed is likely to reconsider and not "taper" at all! In other words, it could be a self-unfulfilling prophecy.  But the ultimate conclusion remains that average Americans are deeply and negatively affected by rising interest rates (not to mention what it means for interest paid on new national debt). If the "taper" means a rise in those rates, average Americans should be aware and should care.
REUTERS/Marcos BrindicciDemonstrators carry a banner made of Brazilian national flags during a protest against the Confederations Cup and President Dilma Rousseff's government, in Recife City June 20, 2013.BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) — Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff spoke about her generation's struggles in battling a dictatorship during a prime-time speech meant to connect with the nation's youth who have energized widespread and at times violent anti-government protests. The 10-minute address ended Rousseff's much-criticized silence in the face of the protests. She promised to make improvements in urban transportation and to battle corruption, but offered few details as to how that will happen. The leader added she would soon hold a meeting with leaders of the protest movement, governors and the mayors of major cities. But it remained unclear exactly who could represent the massive and decentralized groups of demonstrators taking to the streets, venting anger against woeful public services despite a high tax burden. Rousseff said that her government would create a national plan for public transportation in cities — a hike in bus and subway fares in many cities was the original complaint of the protests. She also reiterated her backing for a plan before congress to invest all oil revenue royalties in education and a promise she made earlier to bring in foreign doctors to areas that lack physicians. "I want institutions that are more transparent, more resistant to wrongdoing," Rousseff said in reference to perceptions of deep corruption in Brazilian politics, which is emerging as a focal point of the protests. "It's citizenship and not economic power that must be heard first." The leader, a former Marxist rebel who fought against Brazil's 1964-1985 military regime and was imprisoned for three years and tortured by the junta, pointedly referred to earlier sacrifices made to free the nation from dictatorship. "My generation fought a lot so that the voice of the streets could be heard," Rousseff said. "Many were persecuted, tortured and many died for this. The voice of the street must be heard and respected and it can't be confused with the noise and truculence of some troublemakers." Edvaldo Chaves, a 61-year-old doorman in Rio's upscale Flamengo neighborhood, said he found the speech convincing. "I thought she seemed calm and cool. Plus, because she was a guerrilla and was in exile, she talks about the issue of protests convincingly," Chaves said. "I think things are going to calm down. We'll probably keep seeing people in the streets but probably small numbers now." But Bruna Romao, an 18-year-old store clerk in Sao Paulo, said Rousseff's words probably wouldn't have an impact. "Brazilians are passionate," she said. "We boil over quickly but also cool down fast. But this time it's different, people are in full revolt. I don't see things calming down anytime soon." Trying to decipher the president's reaction to the unrest had become a national guessing game, especially after some 1 million anti-government demonstrators took to the streets nationwide Thursday night to denounce everything from poor public services to the billions of dollars spent preparing for next year's World Cup soccer tournament and the 2016 Olympics in Brazil. The protests continued Friday, as about 1,000 people marched in western Rio de Janeiro city, with some looting stores and invading an enormous $250 million arts center that remains empty after several years of construction. Police tried to disperse the crowd with tear gas as they were pelted with rocks. Police said some in the crowd were armed and firing at officers. Local radio was also reporting that protesters were heading to the apartment of Rio state Gov. Sergio Cabral in the posh Rio neighborhood of Ipanema. Other protests broke out in the country's biggest city, Sao Paulo, where traffic was paralyzed but no violence reported, and in Fortaleza in the country's northeast. Demonstrators were calling for more mobilizations in 10 cities on Saturday. The National Conference of Brazilian Bishops came out in favor of the protests, saying that it maintains "solidarity and support for the demonstrations, as long as they remain peaceful." "This is a phenomenon involving the Brazilian people and the awakening of a new consciousness," church leaders said in the statement. "The protests show all of us that we cannot live in a country with so much inequality." Rousseff had never held elected office before she became president in 2011 and remains clearly uncomfortable in the spotlight. She's the political protege of former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, a charismatic ex-union leader whose tremendous popularity helped usher his former chief of staff to the country's top office. A career technocrat and trained economist, Rousseff's tough managerial style under Silva earned her the moniker "the Iron Lady," a name she has said she detests. While Rousseff stayed away from the public eye for most of the week, Roberto Jaguaribe, the nation's ambassador to Britain, told news channel CNN Friday the government was first trying to contain the protests. He labeled as "very delicate" the myriad demands emanating from protesters in the streets. "One of our ministers who's dealing with these issues of civil society said that it would be presumptuous on our part to think we know what's taking place," Jaguaribe said. "This is a very dynamic process. We're trying to figure out what's going on because who do we speak to, who are the leaders of the process?" Marlise Matos, a political science professor at the Federal University of Minas Gerais, said before Rousseff spoke that answer wasn't good enough. "The government has to respond, even if the agenda seems unclear and wide open," she said. "It should be the president herself who should come out and provide a response. But I think the government is still making strategic calculations to decide how to respond. What I'd like to see as a response is a call for a referendum on political reform. Let the people decide what kind of political and electoral system we have." Social media and mass emails were buzzing with calls for a general strike next week. However, Brazil's two largest nationwide unions, the Central Workers Union and the Union Force, said they knew nothing about such an action, though they do support the protests. A Thursday night march in Sao Paulo was the first with a strong union presence, as a drum corps led members wearing matching shirts down the city's main avenue. Many protesters have called for a movement with no ties to political parties or unions, which are widely considered corrupt here. Several cities have cancelled the transit fare hikes that had originally sparked the demonstrations a week ago, but the outrage has only grown more intense. Demonstrations for Saturday have been called by a group opposing a federal bill that would limit the power of prosecutors to investigate crimes. Most protesters have been peaceful, and crowds have taken to chanting "No violence! No violence!" when small groups have prepared to burn and smash. The more violent demonstrators have usually taken over once night has fallen. The unrest is hitting the nation as it hosts the Confederations Cup soccer tournament, with tens of thousands of foreign visitors in attendance. Carlos Cardozo, a 62-year-old financial consultant who joined Friday's protest in Rio, said he thought the unrest could cost Rousseff next year's elections. Even as recently as last week, Rousseff had enjoyed a 74 percent approval rating in a poll by the business group the National Transport Confederation. "Her paying lip service by saying she's in favor of the protests is not helping her cause," Cardozo said. "People want to see real action, real decisions, and it's not this government that's capable of delivering." ___ Barchfield reported from Rio de Janeiro and Brooks from Sao Paulo.

This week we put together our quarterly feature on the most important charts in the world based on the suggestions of many of Wall Street's brightest investors, economists, and analysts. Given the recent turmoil in markets, the contribution from SocGen's Kit Juckes was very timely. He titled it: The Bubble With No Name (Yet). It demonstrates that each of the last big bubbles have been characterized by periods where the Fed Funds rate has been held well below year-over-year nominal GDP growth. He argues that this time around is no exception, and that that a desire to curb whatever bubbles are building up suggests that the baby steps the Fed took this week were exactly appropriate. BI
Flickr / Tambako the Jaguar The U.S. economy is in recovery mode right now. Sure, investors have been spooked by Fed taper talks, the Bank of Japan's unprecedented economic experiment, persistent jitters out of Europe, and concerns of a credit crisis in China. But by in large, investors should be pleased with the way things are going domestically, according to a new report from Joseph Quinlan, Chief Market Strategist for U.S. Trust. We walk you through U.S. Trust's 10 theses that show "what's right with America." 1) The U.S. economy is the largest and most productive in the worldÂ - The U.S. accounts for one-fifth of global GDP with only 4.5% of the world's population. America's economy is nearly twice the size of China's in nominal dollars. Plus, the U.S. is one of just a few developed countries with real GDP higher than it was before the crisis, according to the report. U.S. Trust 2) The U.S. leads the world in manufactured goods -Â Nominal manufacturing output totaled $1.9 trillion in 2012, a rise of 27% from 2009. Employment in the sector has increased by 500,000 workers since 2010, according to U.S. Trust. U.S. Trust 3) The U.S. is among the largest exporters of goods and services -Â Exports since the recession have taken off. In 2012, total exports totaled $2.2 trillion, nearly a 40% rise from 2009 levels, according to the report. U.S. Trust 4) Foreign investors still love the U.S.-Â U.S. Foreign Direct Investment inflows in the post-crisis years racked up $736 billion. That's 15% of the global total, according to U.S. Trust. And while people talk about investment in China, America is still on top by a landslide. U.S. Trust 5) America has the top global brands - In 2008, eight out of 10 of the world's top brands were American. U.S. Trusts 6) The U.S. is the world leader in technology -Â People still flock to America to become tech innovators. The U.S. is home to the major social media players and beats out other countries in spending levels. U.S. Trusts 7) America has the world's best collegesÂ - American college kids fill their minds with kegs worth of knowledge at some of the world's best universities. Six out of the top 10 universities in the 2012Â Quacquarelli Symonds World Rankingsâ€™ were American. U.S. Trusts 8) The U.S. dollar is king -Â It's the world's reserve currency. From the U.S. Trust report: "The greenback accounted for roughly 62% of global central bank reserves as of the fourthÂ quarter of 2012, according to the IMF, a share down slightly from 2008 but relatively constant over the post-crisis years." It crushed the beleaguered Euro. U.S. Trusts 9) The U.S. has one of the most competitive economies -Â In the latest competitiveness survey from the World Economic Forum, the U.S. slipped to seventh place, down two spots, according to the report. Still, U.S. Trust guesses America will head north on the list in the future. U.S. Trusts 10) America is in the middle of an energy Renaissance -Â Much to the chagrin of some environmentalists, U.S. domestic oil production is in revival mode. It exceeded imports for the first time in 16 years, according to the report. Thanks to "fracking" that unlocked shale in North Dakota, Oklahoma, and Texas, the U.S. has seen a major surge in production, the report notes. U.S. Trusts Â 
NASA Here's how you know we had a huge week in the market: Research analysts start using blogger terminology in their notes. George Goncalves, the top interest rate strategy at Nomura, has a note out titled "The Fed's Big Bang Moment, Reversible?" and it starts like this: An epic week, to say the least, as markets re-priced to what some are calling the start of a new hawkish Fed world order. And it gets better: Unless one believes in time-travel, one cannot reverse the Fed‘s big bang moment. Given the rules changed, we need to respect the shift, take a step back and re-analyze our views for now. So what exactly happened this week to prompt such talk of "epic" moves? Well if you were only going to look at one chart, it would have to be the yield on the 10-year US bond. As you can see on this chart via Bloomberg, the yield has been rising since the beginning of May, but in the last week it went vertical, with interest rates ending at 2.53%. Bloomberg So what's this new "hawkish" Fed all about. Essentially what happened was, Bernanke made it clear that the "taper" (the wind down of bond purchases) is on. Assuming the economy stays on forecast, the taper will start later this year, with a goal of having it wrapped up sometime in the middle of next year. It was his certainty that this is indeed the plan (as he even put some hard numbers next to the QE thresholds) that seemed to spook the market the most. In a note published right after the Bernanke press conference, Goldman's Jan Hatzius identified 5 reasons why you could characterize Bernanke as hawkish. We summarize in bullets: So the view from Wall Street is that we got regime change this week. For the first time since the crisis, we got hints of the Fed actually wanting to turn the corner. It may be awhile before the Fed actually does turn the corner. But clearly the Fed wants to, and thus the "epic" week Goncalves is referring to above.
Short-term borrowing rates in China have soared to record highs as credit seizes up, prompting fears that the countryâ€™s liquidity squeeze may be spinning out of control. The Shibor overnight lending rate in Shanghai spiked violently to 29pc, with wild moves in seven-day and one-month money. The central bank refused to intervene to calm markets, apparently determined to purge excess from the credit system. China Securities Journal, a voice of the regulators, said: â€œWe cannot use a fast money supply growth as in the past, or even faster, to promote economic growth.â€ â€œI am extremely concerned about China,â€ said Lars Christensen from Danske Bank. â€œThey are overdoing it and are on the verge of making the same mistake as the Fed and the European Central Bank before the Lehman crisis in 2008, when they failed to see how much the economy was slowing.â€ Mr Christensen said the world now risks a â€œperfect stormâ€ as the Fed prepares to taper its bond purchases (QE) at the same time as tightening the spigot of worldwide dollar liquidity. The twin effects are cascading through emerging markets, pummelling commodity exporters such as Brazil, South Africa and Russia that sell to China, but also tripping up Turkey, Ukraine, Hungary and others that rely on external funding. â€œEverything is being hit indiscriminately,â€ said Neil Shearing from Capital Economics. The Turkish lira and the Indian rupee both fell to record lows as investors pencilled in Fed tapering for September. â€œThe party is over,â€ said Ceros Securities in Istanbul. Fed chairman Ben Bernanke has brought forward his QE exit by lifting the unemployment target from 6.5pc to 7pc. He dismissed the looming threat of deflation as a â€œtransitoryâ€ effect. Brazilâ€™s real weakened to a four-year low of 2.26 against the dollar, down 15pc since April, while the cost of credit default swaps gauging risk in Indonesia and Vietnam jumped more than 40 points. The Kremlin said Russian companies may have to delay bond issues, but denied immediate credit stress. The latest country moving onto the radar screen is Poland, where construction crashed 28pc in May, â€œPoland is suddenly stalling, something we havenâ€™t seen in almost two decades. The central bank has been way too hawkish,â€ said Bartosz Pawlowski from BNP Paribas. Benoit Anne from Societe Generale said the â€œsecond legâ€ of the emerging market sell-off is just starting, warning that there is a â€œlong wayâ€ to go before investors wake up to the full impact of Fed tightening. Latin Americaâ€™s debt crisis of the early Eighties and East Asiaâ€™s crisis in the Nineties were both triggered by turns in the US credit cycle, though emerging markets have ample foreign reserves to defend themselves this time. Mr Shearing said the BRICS quintet will be much weaker than assumed over the next two years for their own structural reasons, but there is now the risk of a â€œmutually reinforcingâ€ effect as dollar stimulus drains away. The latest ructions in China came after premier Li Keqiang omitted mention of the liquidity strains in a speech this week, instead dwelling on rampant excess in the shadow banking system and overcapacity in obsolete areas of the economy. Though Deutsche Bank said the unwinding of hot money inflows disguised by over-invoicing may also be to blame. Mr Liâ€™s comments were a signal that the new leadership intends to prick the credit bubble, even though the hard line has already led to industrial recession. Chinaâ€™s HSBC manufacturing index fell sharply in June, dropping further below the â€œboom-bust lineâ€ to 48.3. Zhiwei Zhang from Nomura said Beijing aims to crack down on a plethora of trusts, wealth products and offshore vehicles intended to evade loan curbs. These have accounted for half Chinaâ€™s credit growth over the past year. It is willing to â€œtolerate short-term painâ€ to wean China off over-investment, and is less worried about social instability now that its workforce has begun to contract and the rate of migrants from rural areas is slowing. The strategy is to tighten before the Fed winds down QE in order to â€œavoid two negative shocks occurring simultaneouslyâ€, but this may be hard to manage given the scale of the boom. â€œWe expect a painful deleveraging process in the next few months. Some defaults will likely occur in manufacturing industry and in non-bank financial institutions,â€ he said. Fitch Ratings said total credit has jumped from $9 trillion to $23 trillion over the past five years, surging from 125pc to 200pc of GDP. This is a bigger rise than in any of the major bubbles worldwide over the past half century. China has the firepower to cope with any crisis and will not let the state banking system collapse. Keeping growth on track now that credit has reached saturation point is a tougher challenge. 
The France that I see as I look out from the bullet train today is far different from the France I see when I survey the economic data. Going from Marseilles to Paris, the countryside is magnificent. The farms are laid out as if by a landscape artist – this is not the hurly-burly no-nonsense look of the Texas landscape. The mountains and forests that we glide through are glorious. It is a weekend of special music all over France, and last night in Marseilles the stages were alive and the crowds out in force. The French people smile and graciously correct my pidgin attempts at speaking French. I have found it diplomatic not to mention that I think France is in for a very difficult future. Why spoil the party? But for you, gentle reader, I will survey the economic landscape that I see on my computer screen. It shows a far different France from the one outside my window, one that resembles its peripheral southern neighbors far more than its neighbors to the north and east. The picture is not all bad, of course. There is always much to admire and love about France. But there are a lot of hard political choices to be made and much reform to be undertaken if this beautiful country is to remain La Belle France and not become the sick man of Europe. This week, in what I think will be a short letter, we'll look at a few of the problems facing France.   Yesterday (June 20) the French called a Grand Summit of businesses, unions, and government officials to address the needed reforms to make France more competitive and its national budget more sustainable. Debt and deficits are high and rising as the country rolls into yet another recession in response to President Hollande’s hard left turn last year. One of the key issues is a very controversial plan to reform pensions. Stratfor notes: France spends roughly 12.5 percent of its gross domestic product on pensions, more than most almost any other Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development member. (For reference, Germany spends about 11.4 percent of its GDP on pensions, and Japan spends roughly 8.7 percent.) [Note: elsewhere we find that France has a comprehensive social security (sécurité sociale) system covering healthcare, injuries at work, family allowances, unemployment insurance, and old age (pensions), invalidity and death benefits.  France spends more on ‘welfare' than almost any other EU country: over 30 per cent of GDP as a total entitlement cost. As a reference, that would be about $5 trillion in the US.] The fact that an increasingly larger proportion of France's population qualifies for pensions factors into the debate. In 1975, there were 31 workers paying contributions for every 10 retirees; today, there are 14 workers paying contributions for every 10 retirees. As the baby boomers from the 1950s and 1960s begin to retire in the next decade, the pressure on France's coffers will grow substantially. The deficit of the French pension system is projected to double between 2010 and 2020, when it will exceed 20 billion euros. It is hard for Americans to understand just how much it costs to support the average French worker (or to be self-employed). From Paris Voice: Total social security revenue is around €200 billion per year and the social security budget is higher than the gross national product (GNP), i.e. social security costs more than the value of what the country produces. Not surprisingly, social security benefits are among the highest in the EU. Total contributions per employee (too around 15 funds) average around 60 per cent of gross pay, some 60 per cent of what is paid by employers (an impediment to hiring staff).  The self-employed must pay the full amount (an impediment to self-employment!)  However, with the exception of sickness benefits, social security benefits aren't taxed; indeed they're deducted from your taxable income.  Equally unsurprisingly, the public has been highly resistant to any change that might reduce benefits, while employers are pushing to have their contributions lowered. And of course, almost the first thing that Monsieur Hollande did when he took office last year was to return the retirement age at which you qualify for a pension back to age 60 from the extremely controversial 62 that his predecessor, Sarkozy, had barely managed to push it to. Sarkozy’s “reforms” were greeted with massive protests, and Hollande used them to engineer a sweeping election victory for the Socialists. (I put “reforms” in quotes because nowhere else would a retirement age of 62 be seen as draconian, nor would the rest of the changes Sarkozy pushed through.) Hollande faces a whole series of problems. Ambrose Evans-Pritchard notes: The IMF’s Article IV Report on France published before the elections draws up the indictment charges: a state share of GDP above 55pc (or 56pc this year), higher than in Scandinavia, but without Nordic labour flexibility. One of the rich world’s highest life expectancies but earliest retirement ages, a costly mix. Just 39.7pc of those aged 55 to 64 are working, compared with 56.7pc in the UK and 57.7pc in Germany. “French workers spend the longest time in retirement among advanced countries,” [the IMF] said. (the London Telegraph) France has the highest tax and social security burden in the Eurozone and the second lowest annual working time. There has been a sharp rise in unit labor costs, making France even less competitive. These developments have not gone unnoticed in Germany. A report by one of the conservative political parties there (the FDP) said, “French President Francois Hollande was trifling with reform, scarcely making a dent on the sclerotic labour market. Which is true of course. Hollande was elected in May 2012 on a campaign to preserve the status quo and protect the privileges of the French.” (Ambrose Evans-Pritchard, the Telegraph) Not helping is the fact that France had a very anemic “recovery” after the Great Recession (never more than 1% a year) and is now back in full recession. Which means that tax revenues will go down, not up, and that deficits will swell. Maulidin And things are likely to get even worse. Charles Gave notes that French manufacturing is plummeting, and this has always led to further losses in GDP. The chart below from GaveKal shows the French Business Climate Survey advanced forward 9 months and the highly correlated GDP number, which follows. The IMF is now predicting a 2% annual recession in 2013, which means rising unemployment and very tepid 0.8% growth in 2014, not enough to really spur employment. GaveKal You can read a half a dozen reports and analyses of the French predicament, and they will all mention “labor rigidities” as being part of the problem. There is a high minimum wage cost, and it is hard to let employees go in difficult times, which discourages businesses from hiring young, inexperienced workers. New business start-ups, the source of real job growth, have fallen as a result of the relentless assault by the bureaucracy on entrepreneurs, not to mention the impredations of the tax-man. Corporate profit margins are thin in France, and companies are leaving for locales that afford them more-attractive cost options. Debt servicing costs as a percentage of GDP have plunged in France from 3% in 1995 to 2% (today) even as the total amount of debt has risen four times. Low interest rates can be a thing of beauty if you want to lower costs, but when interest rates rise (and they would with a vengeance in the not too distant future if the ECB were not ready to step in, as the market clearly expects it to do) they can cripple a government already burdened with too large a deficit and unwieldy commitments. But without real reforms, how long will it be before the market sees France as another problem child, like Italy and Spain? Austerity is a four-letter Anglo-Saxon – or even worse, Teutonic – word in socialist France, yet the market at some point is going to want to see a move toward sustainable budgets. Government bond investors are not philanthropists. They look for the least risk they can find. A realistic assessment will soon be made that France is no longer in the least-risky category. Compounding Hollande’s problems is a growing disenchantment with the whole European project in France, the putative home of the movement for integration. Mauildin No European country is becoming more dispirited and disillusioned faster than France. In just the past year, the public mood has soured dramatically across the board. The French are negative about the economy, with 91% saying it is doing badly, up 10 percentage points since 2012. They are negative about their leadership: 67% think President Francois Hollande is doing a lousy job handling the challenges posed by the economic crisis, a criticism of the president that is 24 points worse than that of his predecessor, Nicolas Sarkozy. The French are also beginning to doubt their commitment to the European project, with 77% believing European economic integration has made things worse for France, an increase of 14 points since last year. And 58% now have a bad impression of the European Union as an institution, up 18 points from 2012. (Tyler Durden, Zero Hedge) And Stratfor adds: Hollande thus faces a dilemma: He could try to push for comprehensive reforms unilaterally, but that would be incredibly unpopular, at least in the short term. Otherwise, he could try to enact diluted reforms, which would be more palatable for French citizens but ultimately would be ineffective at reducing the costs of the French pension system. Hollande's problem is shared by many Western European leaders, who have responded to the ongoing economic crisis by implementing painful reforms in their welfare states. The problem is that countries consider the welfare state one of the defining economic, political and social features of postwar Europe and a symbol of economic prosperity. The French have a long and rich tradition of fighting for their civil and social rights, and the notion of a social contract between rulers and the constituents is a key feature of French politics. For the French – not to mention the Italians, Spanish or Germans – a generous welfare state is an acquired right, a part of the social contract in Europe. But what one group may see as an acquired right another will see as a tax burden, excessive cost, and unwanted risk. This is not just a French problem, of course. Governments everywhere have promised far more than they can ever deliver. And when a program gets prohibitively expensive, adjustments will be made. It goes without saying that when you cut a promised benefit to people who are already retired or soon will be, they will not be happy. In July, 2012 Hollande called the first Grand Summit to solve the very same problems that were still facing at the latest one. As there is not yet a true crisis, no imminent cliff to fall over, I doubt that anything of substance will get done. Which means there will be yet another conference in the future as the stress intensifies. Hollande is now down to a 30% approval rating. True reforms would anger his base, and a lack of them will lead to even lower ratings by the markets. He has no standing within his own party to force a compromise; and as elections draw closer, fewer and fewer within his party will want to be seen in a photo op with him. France is on its way to becoming the new Greece. In 20 years, the Harvard Business School will do a case study on what not to do when faced with a massive fiscal crisis. France and Hollande will be Exhibit #1. I am in Paris this weekend, meeting with my Mauldin Economics partner Olivier Garret in his home country. (He now lives in Vermont, so he still resides in a socialist state.) I fly to Cyprus on Monday morning, where I will have a series of meetings with local businessmen and officials for two days. I speak Wednesday evening at 6 pm at the Central Bank, through the auspices of the University of Cyprus and the Cyprus Chamber of Commerce, on the topic of "Currency Wars and Quantitative Easing." Then I leave irrationally early the next morning for Split, Croatia, where I will spend a night before being gathered by the rogue Irish economist David McWilliams for a few days of relaxation and laughter. It is impossible to keep from laughing for very long around David, even when he is telling you that you are doomed. He has Irish gifts in abundance. On Sunday I fly to Geneva, hoping my bags get there with me, to have meetings and face yet more deadlines; but I'll also get to enjoy an encore al fresco dinner with Herwig van Hove and friends. I see that several mutual friends will be there, chief among them Louis Gave, who will be in town for a different set of meetings. I remember (I think it was two years ago about this time) that Herwig hosted another dinner party where Louis’s father, Charles, was in attendance and in rare form. I remember there were 16 people present, all involved in the investment business in one way or another. Charles and I were at the center of the table facing each other, bantering back and forth, with me serving as the straight man for Charles. It was a gorgeous summer evening and the table was relaxed, with the wine and food matching the magnificence of the weather. We were debating the valuation of the euro, and I asked for a poll of the group as to whether they thought the euro would be higher or lower the next year. The show of hands had 11 voting lower, 7 thinking higher, and one abstention. (Yes, that is 19 votes for 16 people, but there were a number of economists present, who evidently felt compelled to vote in both directions, presumably using different hands, at least.) I will remember the next moment all my life. I had noticed that Charles did not vote. I asked him about that, and he answered in that authoritative tone of voice that sounds to me exactly like what the voice of God should sound like, punctuating the air with his finger for emphasis, “John, that is an absurd question. The euro will not exist in a year.” I will remind Louis and the table of that moment and ask the same question if Herwig will allow me – and I'll report back. I am in the midst of designing a new abode. Since it has been a very long time and I've undergone a few personal reinventions since I last owned a home, I have never really collected much in the way of art. And while I am not in a hurry to do so, I now find myself with an opportunity to discover some special pieces that I will enjoy seeing and sharing on a regular basis. I have “placeholder” pieces that can suffice while I patiently look, but I am currently seeking one special piece to hang over my dining room table. I am not looking for a chandelier, but rather a light that is art in and of itself. The apartment is a floor-to-ceiling glass high-rise, ten-foot ceilings, very open; and the table is glass. The overall theme is contemporary modern. When you walk in, almost the first thing you will notice after the view is that one piece of art suspended over the dining room table. Except that I don’t know what it is yet. Since my readers obviously have exquisite taste,  it seems reasonable to ask you. I am very open to suggestions. It is time to hit the send button as there is a music festival near here that needs my attention. Although last night I ended up in an Irish pub in Marseilles, listening to old ballads as I read and thought. Have a great week and spend a few moments with friends. They always pay the best dividends. Your planning on seeing a few museums analyst, John Mauldinsubscribers@MauldinEconomics.com Copyright 2013 John Mauldin. All Rights Reserved.
