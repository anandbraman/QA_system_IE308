ReutersAsian markets are mostly down after the FOMC released minutes of its October meeting. The minutes showed that the Fed is planning to taper its $85 billion monthly asset purchase program "in coming months." And that the FOMC sees "several significant risks," to the economy in the future. Chinese stocks were down ahead of the HSBC Flash PMI reading that showed that manufacturing hit a two-month low. Japanese stocks are however up as the yen weakened against the greenback. Here's a look at how the markets are doing:
REUTERS/Bobby YipHSBC China flash PMI fell to a two-month low of 50.4 in November.This missed expectations for a modest decline to 50.8, and was lower than 50.9 the previous month. The latest manufacturing report showed that export orders fell, suggesting a weaker external environment. A reading below 50 suggests contraction. "Chinaâ€™s growth momentum softened a little in November, as the HSBC Flash China Manufacturing PMI moderated due to the weak new export orders and slowing pace of restocking activities," said HSBC's chief China economist, Hongbin Qu in a press release.Â  "That said, this is still the second-highest PMI reading in seven months. The muted inflationary pressures should enable Beijing to keep policy relatively accommodative to support growth." Here's a look at the sub-indices of the PMI report: Markit Economics Here's a look at how China's manufacturing PMI has shaped up: HSBC/Markit Economics The Flash PMI number is released about a week before the final number and is based on 85-90% of PMI survey responses each month.
In an interesting twist, Google has introduced a debit card, it announced on Wednesday. Google has been trying to gain traction in the mobile payments business with Google Wallet, a smartphone app. You link a bank account or credit card to it and it transfers money into the Google Wallet. Then you can pay for stuff by waving your phone in front of a device that reads the Wallet, at places that accept payment that way. But what if you want to pay for something at a place that doesn't accept Google Wallet? What if you want to use an ATM? So Google bucked up and created an old-fashioned way to deal with this, a debit card. It's free for Google Wallet users, although it's only available in the U.S. It's accepted at all the places that accept MasterCard. Another bonus: this debit card charges no annual or monthly fees. It sort of defeats the purpose of using your smartphone as a wallet but it also makes sense that Google would do this. It needs to take baby steps to encourage people to move away from their usual payment methods in favor of a smartphone app.
Bitcoin has a lot of potential and a long way to go, Bobby Lee, co-founder and CEO of BTC China, said Wednesday. "In terms of its value, I wouldn't worry too much about how many percent it's been up year to date because ... if you look at the five-year history of bitcoin, it literally started at zero," he said. Bitcoin's value in U.S. dollar terms has been up more than 4,100 percent year to date. Bitcoin ended the day at $542.40. On CNBC's "Fast Money," Lee said that bitcoin had a big hill to climb. (Read more: Bitcoin goes to Washington—and Brooklyn) "For it to be a true worldwide asset class, it would have to have a very, very large circulation value to account for the global population," he said. Lee noted that gold, with a 170,000 tons in circulation, equals less than 1 ounce per person on earth. (Read more: Meet the Subway franchise owner who accepts bitcoin) "If you compare it to that, bitcoin is a fraction of what it could become in terms of a global asset class," he said. "As we get to a future utopian society, if bitcoin were really to take hold in this society, then the total circulation value would have to be in the trillions, and to get from zero to trillions is going to be a bumpy ride." Lee admitted that there was little to stop someone from creating another digital currency but argued that the open-source bitcoin was "already way in the lead." (Read more: It doesn't jingle, but bitcoin value soars) Regulation would likely be needed for bitcoin exchanges, he added, to prevent such instances such as the alleged disappearance of an estimated $4 million worth of bitcoin from a Chinese exchange. "That issue is with the exchange," Lee said. "You know, it's probably run by some unscrupulous people who ran away or disappeared so far. That's why bitcoin exchanges probably need to be regulated, so that it doesn't happen again in the future." —By CNBC's Bruno J. Navarro.

For advisors to "take away clients from other advisors" and "thrive" in times of crisis, they need to do seven key things.Â  1. Get more face-to-face time with potential and existing clients. 2. Place themselves in situations where their "conversation can serve as a segue into offering a second opinion." 3. Know their message in advance. 4. Be assertive. 5. Meet with CPAs and attorney and warn them about red flags they should be watching for. 6. Maintain a work-life balance 7. Maintain a social and business relationship with a client or prospective client.

Emerging Market Stocks Are Still Way Cheaper Than US Stocks (BlackRock) BlackRock thinks emerging market stocks still look cheap â€” considering their potential for growth and improved corporate profits â€” especially when compared with U.S. stocks. "Despite the recent emerging market stock rebound, EM equities were still trading at a 36% discount to U.S. stocks, and below their three-year average valuation, as of October 10, 2013, as measured by price-to-book ratios."

HOWARD MARKS: Investing In A Diversified Portfolio Is At The Heart Of Prudent Investing In High Bonds (Advisor Perspectives) When asked if it makes sense to own individual bonds over bond funds Howard Marks, CEO of , said "probably, because the bond fund never pays off." "On the other hand, it is very hard for individuals to make those choices. It is very hard to know enough about enough bonds to have an intelligently diversified portfolio. We have approximately 140 names in our portfolios; that is a lot safer than going out and buying 10. The people picking those 140 bonds are experts, and that is a lot safer than some novice buying the 10. If you combine the lack of diversification in individually bought bonds with the lack of expertise, then you really get in trouble if you try it yourself. An emphasis on investing in a diversified portfolio has always been at the heart of prudent investing in high bonds."
Twitter The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced this week it is opening an investigation into the three Tesla Model S fires over the past two months, stoking the flames of a controversy of whether or not electric cars are safe. In response, Tesla CEO Elon Musk wrote a blog post pointing out that no one in any of the fires had been injured, and that each had been caused by an unusual, high-speed accident. (He also said Tesla requested the investigation, which the NHTSA denies.) But when you look at the numbers, it's clear that Musk is right to complain about all this attention: Vehicle fires are quite common, so it's unfair to go crazy when they happen in electric cars, too.Â  According to the Department of Transportation, in 2010, Americans drove 2.999 trillion miles. That year, there were 308,745,538 people in the country, and .78 vehicles per person, for a total ofÂ 240,821,520 vehicles â€” the vast majority of which are powered by gasoline. So for the U.S. in 2010, that makes 1 fire for every 1,305 vehicles, and 1 fire for every 16.26 million miles driven. Now let's look at Tesla. According to Musk, there are about 25,000 Model S cars on the road worldwide, and they have driven over 100 million miles (we'll round that down). There have been 3 fires.Â  So for Tesla, that makes 1 fire for every 8,333 cars, and 1 fire for everyÂ 33.3 million miles driven.Â  The numbers stand with Musk.
There is a great entrepreneurial story behind Domino's Pizza (NYSE: DPZ). The company was founded in 1960 by two brothers who borrowed $900 to pay for their first store and used a Volkswagen Beetle to deliver their first pizzas. Today there are more than nine thousand stores around the world, with more than four thousand of them located abroad. Since 2008, Domino's Pizza has experienced massive international store growth, beating the growth rate of competitors Yum! Brands (NYSE: YUM) — which owns Pizza Hut — and Papa John's Pizza (NASDAQ: PZZA).  However, Domino's future in 2010 looked quite bleak. Strong competition, harsh criticism over the taste of its pizzas, and low consumer satisfaction levels were playing against the company's revenue. That's when management decided to adopt a surprising market strategy: admit that its product was awful. The company spent millions in creating a new pizza from the crust up, expanding its menu offering, and advertising the process. The results have been amazing. Between 2000 and 2013, America's customer satisfaction index score for Domino's Pizza increased from 69% to 81%. More importantly, the company's revenue has also improved significantly. How exactly did Domino's Pizza manage to turnaround its business, though, and what are the company's plans to keep delivering growth revenue in the future? Source: Domino's Pizza Investor Relations. Domino's amazing turnaround was a result of extensive efforts to improve the company's processes and menu offerings by introducing new recipes, using mobile technology to attract new customers, and improving supply chain management. As a result, the company not only improved its top line performance but also became the fourth largest e-tailer in the U.S. Domino's main competitive advantage has always been the ability to deliver pizza quickly. In order to implement fast service, however, the company had to rely heavily on frozen, pre-made ingredients. This allowed employees to assemble pizza in record times, but it also had a negative effect on quality. Because of poor quality control, most customers started to recognized Pizza Hut as the best-tasting pizza and relied on Domino's only for quick delivery. The first task for J.Patrick Doyle, who became the CEO of Domino's in 2010, was to change the company's core pizza recipe. Domino's tested dozens of cheeses and sauces before determining the final ingredients of its new pizza. It carried out blind taste tests with 1,800 random pizza consumers, coming out on top and beating both Pizza Hut and Papa John's by a wide margin. To market its new pizza, the company implemented an honest marketing campaign that apologized for its old pizzas. To attract new customers, the company developed mobile apps with great user experience, allowing customers to design their own pizzas. To protect its core competence, management began revamping the company's online tracking system to minimize delivery time. The results were astonishing: at the end of the first quarter of 2010, the company posted a 14.3% increase in revenue. Furthermore, since these changes were implemented the company's stock has risen a whopping 400%. Domino's Pizza strategy worked because it focused on building new competitive advantages without losing old ones like its fast delivery service. This strategy allowed the company to deliver great results despite increasing competition. Notice that the world's third-largest pizza company, Papa John's, is trying to capture market share from Domino's and Pizza Hut by differentiating its pizza with natural ingredients and by offering diversity in its topping options. With 80% of its locations in North America, the company has plenty of growth opportunities available in emerging markets where it is planning aggressive expansion. This expansion is being facilitated by reducing the investment needed to open a franchise restaurant to roughly $200,000. On the other hand, Yum! Brands recently experienced a tough quarter due to poor sales in China. The company's top line performance and customer confidence were particularly affected by a breakout of avian flu and bad publicity on poultry issues.  Although the environment remains competitive, Domino's long-term focus on building competitive advantages has allowed the company to develop an economic moat. It not only offers an interesting value proposition, but also has plenty of growth opportunities available since its presence in international markets is still very limited. This is especially the case if compared with Yum! Brands. 
The company authorized a $1 billion share buybackÂ and said it sees low Q1 growth. It also declared a divided of $0.25. Earnings beatÂ estimates at $0.89.Â Analysts were expecting $0.75. Revenues came in at $1.05 billion versus $964 million consensus. K-Cup sales were up more 18% YOY. The company continued to project double-digit revenue growth long-term.

This morning's release of new CPI figures showed that, once again, we're seeing pretty tepid inflation. Consumer price inflation fell to 1.0% year over year in October from September's 1.2% rate, well below the level at which the Federal Reserve would consider changing monetary policy. And as interest rate strategist Vincent Foster pointed out on Twitter, excluding the deflationary period of 2008-2009, this 1% print is the lowest year-over-year CPI reading since 1965.

REUTERS/StringerPeople play with pigeons at a park in Wuhan, Hubei province, April 10, 2013.Can money buy happiness? If the Chinese growth story is to be believed, the answer is no.  Despite their per capita income being nearly 20 times what it was in the late '80's, the Chinese have experienced a decline in life satisfaction. China’s growth model has not been completely "happy," according to the Oxford Companion to the Economics of China ,write Shenggen Fan of the IFPRI, Ravi Kanbur of Cornell University, Shang-Jin Wei of Columbia University and Xiaobo Zhang of Peking University.  They believe there are four reasons for this:  1. The relative wealth effect:  As income increases, people's aspiration primes to a new target. Relative deprivation is a widespread phenomenon. For example, when seeing neighbors suddenly getting rich, one may feel relatively deprived and less happy even though his own income does not change at all." 2. While the Chinese economy has done well overall, there is a large rural-urban gap in income: "The large rural-urban gap in income and access to public service has been a defining feature of the contemporary Chinese economy, generating a major source of resentment for rural residents. Although during the reform period, health indicators have improved, their rural-urban gap has widened." 3. The higher education gap between rural and urban populations has widened: "Thanks to the nine-year mandatory education law introduced in 1986, illiteracy rate has largely been eliminated in both rural and urban areas (Li, entry in this volume). However, the access to higher education has widened. In the late 1970s, most of the college students came from rural areas. However, the share of rural student dropped to only 10% in elite universities in recent years. There is an emerging trend that many rich families send their children abroad for college, even high school education. The number of studying abroad has increased at an annual rate of 25% in the past decade. Of course, the share of studying abroad among rural families was much lower than their urban counterparts." 4. The state of the environment hasn't helped:  "Some undesirable outcomes of growth negatively affect people's life satisfaction. Environment problems and food safety are now among the top concerns of urban residents. The heavy smog in Beijing in early 2013 highlighted the seriousness of the problem. The pollution index in Beijing exceeded the safety threshold for 19 days out of 31 days (Washington Post, 2013). Two Chinese cities command the top spots in the lists of the world's ten most polluted places. Air pollution has become a national problem." Read the entire paper at NBER »
The auto industry has become so globalized, you can find the same Ford in Detroit and in Beijing. So it's not surprising that Americans' taste in passenger vehicles has become a bit homogenized.Â  To find how much difference there is in our car-buying habits, we asked Kelley Blue Book to pull the data from the start of the year to find the best-selling ride in each state. Not surprisingly, Ford F-Series family of trucks dominated the list, coming in at number one in more than 30 states. But Americans elsewhere have different tastes: Florida and Maryland went for the Toyota Camry. Hawaii liked the Toyota Tacoma. Oklahoma bucked the geographic trend â€” the most popular car there is the Nissan Altima sedan. Here's the full map, you can click to enlarge. Mike Nudelman / Business Insider

By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk's domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System's account over the intermeeting period. The Committee considered a proposal to convert the existing temporary central bank liquidity swap arrangements to standing arrangements with no preset expiration dates. The Manager described the proposed arrangements, noting that the Committee would still be asked to review participation in the arrangements annually. A couple of participants expressed reservations about the proposal, citing opposition to swap lines with foreign central banks in general or questioning the governance implications of these standing arrangements in particular. Following the discussion, the Committee unanimously approved the following resolution: "The Federal Open Market Committee directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to convert the existing temporary dollar liquidity swap arrangements with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, and the Swiss National Bank to standing facilities, with the modifications approved by the Committee. In addition, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to convert the existing temporary foreign currency liquidity swap arrangements with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, and the Swiss National Bank to standing facilities, also with the modifications approved by the Committee. Drawings on the dollar and foreign currency liquidity swap lines will be approved by the Chairman in consultation with the Foreign Currency Subcommittee. The Foreign Currency Subcommittee will consult with the Federal Open Market Committee prior to the initial drawing on the dollar or foreign currency liquidity swap lines if possible under the circumstances then prevailing; authority to approve subsequent drawings of a more routine character for either the dollar or foreign currency liquidity swap lines may be delegated to the Manager, in consultation with the Chairman. The Chairman may change the rates and fees on the swap arrangements by mutual agreement with the foreign central banks and in consultation with the Foreign Currency Subcommittee. The Chairman shall keep the Federal Open Market Committee informed of any changes in rates or fees, and the rates and fees shall be consistent with principles discussed with and guidance provided by the Committee." Staff Review of the Economic Situation In general, the data available at the time of the October 29-30 meeting suggested that economic activity continued to rise at a moderate pace; the set of information reviewed for this meeting, however, was reduced somewhat by delays in selected statistical releases associated with the partial shutdown of the federal government earlier in the month. In the labor market, total payroll employment increased further in September, but the unemployment rate was still high. Consumer price inflation continued to be modest, and measures of longer-run inflation expectations remained stable. Private nonfarm employment rose in September but at a slower pace than in the previous month, while total government employment increased at a solid rate. The unemployment rate edged down to 7.2 percent in September; both the labor force participation rate and the employment-to-population ratio were unchanged. Other recent indicators of labor market activity were mixed. Measures of firms' hiring plans improved, the rate of job openings increased slightly, and the rate of long-duration unemployment declined a little. However, household expectations of the labor market situation deteriorated somewhat, the rate of gross private-sector hiring remained flat, and the share of workers employed part time for economic reasons was essentially unchanged and continued to be elevated. In addition, initial claims for unemployment insurance rose in the first few weeks of October, likely reflecting, in part, some spillover effects from the government shutdown. Manufacturing production expanded modestly in September, but output was flat outside of the motor vehicle sector and the rate of total manufacturing capacity utilization was unchanged. Automakers' schedules indicated that the pace of light motor vehicle assemblies would be slightly lower in the coming months, but broader indicators of manufacturing production, such as the readings on new orders from the national and regional manufacturing surveys, pointed to further gains in factory output in the near term. Real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) rose moderately in August. In September, nominal retail sales, excluding those at motor vehicle and parts outlets, increased significantly, while sales of light motor vehicles declined. Recent readings on key factors that influence consumer spending were somewhat mixed: Households' net worth likely expanded further as both equity values and home prices rose in recent months, and real disposable incomes increased solidly in August, but measures of consumer sentiment declined in September and October. The recovery in the housing sector appeared to continue, although recent data in this sector were limited. Starts and permits of new single-family homes increased in August, but starts and permits of multifamily units declined. After falling significantly in July, sales of new homes increased in August, but existing home sales decreased, on balance, in August and September, and pending home sales also contracted. Growth in real private expenditures for business equipment and intellectual property products appeared to be tepid in the third quarter. Nominal shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft rose modestly, on balance, in August and September after declining in July. However, nominal new orders for these capital goods continued to be above the level of shipments, pointing to increases in shipments in subsequent months, and other forward-looking indicators, such as surveys of business conditions, were consistent with some gains in business equipment spending in the near term. Nominal business expenditures for nonresidential construction were essentially unchanged in August. Recent book-value data for inventory-to-sales ratios, along with readings on inventories from national and regional manufacturing surveys, did not point to notable inventory imbalances. Real federal government purchases likely declined as federal employment edged down further in September and many federal employees were temporarily furloughed during the partial government shutdown in October. Real state and local government purchases, however, appeared to increase; the payrolls of these governments expanded briskly in September, and nominal state and local construction expenditures rose in August. The U.S. international trade deficit remained about unchanged in August, as both exports and imports were flat. Available measures of total U.S. consumer prices--the PCE price index for August and the consumer price index for September--increased modestly, as did the core measures, which exclude prices of food and energy. Both near- and longer-term inflation expectations from the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers were little changed, on balance, in September and October. Nominal average hourly earnings for all employees increased slowly in September. Foreign economic growth appeared to improve in the third quarter following a sluggish first half, largely reflecting stronger growth estimated for China and a rebound in Mexico from contraction in the previous quarter. Growth also picked up in the third quarter in the United Kingdom, and available indicators suggested an increase in growth in Canada and continued mild recovery in the euro area. Economic activity in Japan appeared to have decelerated somewhat from its first-half pace but continued to expand, and inflation measured on a 12-month basis turned positive in the middle of this year. Inflation elsewhere generally remained subdued. Monetary policy stayed highly accommodative in advanced foreign economies. In addition, the Bank of Mexico continued to ease monetary policy, citing concerns about the strength of the economy, but central banks in certain other emerging market economies, including Brazil and India, tightened policy and intervened in currency markets in response to concerns about the potential effect of currency depreciation on inflation. Staff Review of the Financial Situation On balance over the intermeeting period, longer-term interest rates declined and equity prices rose, largely in response to expectations for more-accommodative monetary policy. In addition, financial markets were affected for a time by uncertainties about raising the federal debt limit and resolving the government shutdown. Financial market views about the outlook for monetary policy shifted notably following the September FOMC meeting, as the outcome and communications from that meeting were seen as more accommodative than expected. Investors pushed out their anticipated timing of both the first reduction in the pace of FOMC asset purchases and the first hike in the target federal funds rate. The path of the federal funds rate implied by financial market quotes shifted down over the period, as did the path based on the results from the Desk's survey of primary dealers. The Desk's survey also indicated that the dealers had revised up their expectations of the total size of the Committee's asset purchase program. Concerns about the fiscal situation and somewhat weaker-than-expected economic data releases also contributed to the change in expectations about the timing of monetary policy actions. Five- and 10-year yields on both nominal and inflation-protected Treasury securities declined 30 basis points or more over the intermeeting period. The reduction in longer-term Treasury yields was also reflected in other longer-term rates, such as those on agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and corporate securities. Short-term funding markets were adversely affected for a time by concerns about potential delays in raising the federal debt limit. The Treasury bill market was particularly affected as yields on bills maturing between mid-October and early November rose sharply and some bill auctions saw reduced demand. Conditions in other short-term markets, such as the market for repurchase agreements, were also strained. However, these effects eased quickly after an agreement to raise the debt limit was reached in mid-October. Credit flows to nonfinancial businesses appeared to slow somewhat during the fiscal standoff amid increased market volatility; however, access to credit generally remained ample for large firms. Gross issuance of nonfinancial corporate bonds and commercial paper, which had been particularly strong in September, slowed a bit in October. In September, leveraged loan issuance was also robust. Commercial and industrial (C&amp;I) loans at banks continued to advance, on balance, in the third quarter at about the pace posted in the previous quarter, and commercial real estate (CRE) loans at banks rose moderately. In response to the October Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS), banks generally indicated that they had eased standards on C&amp;I and CRE loans over the past three months. Developments affecting financing for the household sector were generally favorable. House prices posted further gains in August. Mortgage rates declined over the intermeeting period, although they were still above their early-May lows. Mortgage refinancing applications were down dramatically compared with May, but purchase applications were only a bit below their earlier level. Some large banks responding to the October SLOOS reported having eased standards on home-purchase loans to prime borrowers on net. In nonmortgage credit, automobile loans and student loans continued to expand at a robust pace, while balances on revolving consumer credit were again about flat. In the municipal bond market, issuance of bonds for new capital projects remained solid. Yields on 20-year general obligation municipal bonds decreased about in line with other longer-term market rates over the intermeeting period. Bank credit declined slightly during the third quarter. Growth of core loans slowed, primarily because of a sizable decline in outstanding balances of residential mortgages on banks' books. Third-quarter earnings reports for large banks generally met or exceeded analysts' modest expectations. M2 grew moderately in September. Preliminary data indicated that growth in M2 picked up temporarily in early October amid uncertainty about the passage of debt limit legislation; deposits increased sharply as institutional investors appeared to shift from money fund shares to bank deposits, and as money funds increased their bank deposits in anticipation of possible redemptions. These inflows to deposits were estimated to have reversed shortly after the debt limit agreement was reached. Foreign stock prices rose, foreign yields and yield spreads declined, and the dollar depreciated against most other currencies. A large portion of these asset price changes occurred immediately following the September FOMC announcement. In addition, yields and the value of the dollar fell further after the debt ceiling agreement was reached and in response to the U.S. labor market report. Mutual fund flows to emerging markets stabilized, following large outflows earlier this year. Staff Economic Outlook In the economic projection prepared by the staff for the October FOMC meeting, the forecast for growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) in the near term was revised down somewhat from the one prepared for the previous meeting, primarily reflecting the effects of the federal government shutdown and some data on consumer spending that were softer than anticipated. In contrast, the staff's medium-term forecast for real GDP was revised up slightly, mostly reflecting lower projected paths for the foreign exchange value of the dollar and longer-term interest rates, along with somewhat higher projected paths for equity prices and home values. The staff anticipated that the pace of expansion in real GDP this year would be about the same as the growth rate of potential output but continued to project that real GDP would accelerate in 2014 and 2015, supported by an easing in the effects of fiscal policy restraint on economic growth, increases in consumer and business sentiment, further improvements in credit availability and financial conditions, and accommodative monetary policy. Real GDP growth was projected to begin to slow a little in 2016 but to remain above potential output growth. The expansion in economic activity was anticipated to slowly reduce resource slack over the projection period, and the unemployment rate was expected to decline gradually. The staff's forecast for inflation was little changed from the projection prepared for the previous FOMC meeting. The staff continued to expect that inflation would be modest in the second half of this year, but higher than its level in the first half. Over the medium term, with longer-run inflation expectations assumed to remain stable, changes in commodity and import prices expected to be relatively small, and slack in labor and product markets persisting over most of the projection period, inflation was projected to run somewhat below the FOMC's longer-run inflation objective of 2 percent through 2016. The staff continued to see a number of risks around the forecast. The downside risks to economic activity included the uncertain effects and future course of fiscal policy, concerns about the outlook for consumer spending growth, and the potential effects on residential construction of the increase in mortgage rates since the spring. With regard to inflation, the staff saw risks both to the downside, that the low rates of core consumer price inflation posted earlier this year could be more persistent than anticipated, and to the upside, that unanticipated increases in energy or other commodity prices could emerge. Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants generally indicated that the broad contours of their medium-term economic projections had not changed materially since the September meeting. Although the incoming data suggested that growth in the second half of 2013 might prove somewhat weaker than many of them had previously anticipated, participants broadly continued to project the pace of economic activity to pick up. The acceleration over the medium term was expected to be bolstered by the gradual abatement of headwinds that have been slowing the pace of economic recovery--such as household-sector deleveraging, tight credit conditions for some households and businesses, and fiscal restraint--as well as improved prospects for global growth. While downside risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market were generally viewed as having diminished, on balance, since last fall, several significant risks remained, including the uncertain effects of ongoing fiscal drag and of the continuing fiscal debate. Consumer spending appeared to have slowed somewhat in the third quarter. A number of participants noted that their outlook for stronger economic activity was contingent on a pickup in growth of consumer spending and reviewed the factors that might contribute to such a development, including low interest rates, easing of debt burdens, continued gains in employment, lower gasoline prices, higher real incomes, and higher household wealth boosted by rising home prices and equity values. Nonetheless, consumer sentiment remained unusually low, posing a downside risk to the forecast, and uncertainty surrounding prospective fiscal deliberations could weigh further on consumer confidence. A few participants commented that a pickup in the growth rates of economic activity or real disposable income could require improvements in productivity growth. However, it was noted that slower growth in productivity might have become the norm. Business contacts generally reported continued moderate growth in sales, but remained cautious about expanding payrolls and capital expenditures. Manufacturing activity in parts of the country was reported to have picked up, and auto sales remained strong. Reports from several Districts indicated that commercial real estate and housing-related business activity continued to advance. In the agricultural sector, crop yields were healthy, farmland values were up, and lower crop prices were increasing the affordability of livestock feed. Wage and cost pressures remained limited, but business contacts in some Districts mentioned that selected labor markets were tight or expressed concerns about a shortage of skilled workers. Reports from the retail sector were mixed, with remarks about higher luxury sales and expectations for reduced hiring of seasonal workers over the upcoming holiday season. Uncertainty about future fiscal policy and the regulatory environment, including changes in health care, were mentioned as weighing on business planning. Participants generally saw the direct economic effects of the partial shutdown of the federal government as temporary and limited, but a number of them expressed concern about the possible economic effects of repeated fiscal impasses on business and consumer confidence. More broadly, fiscal policy, which has been exerting significant restraint on economic growth, was expected to become somewhat less restrictive over the forecast period. Nonetheless, it was noted that the stance of fiscal policy was likely to remain one of the most important headwinds restraining growth over the medium term. Although a number of participants indicated that the September employment report was somewhat disappointing, they judged that the labor market continued to improve, albeit slowly. The limited pace of gains in wages and payrolls, as well as the number of employees working part time for economic reasons, were mentioned as evidence of substantial remaining slack in the labor market. The drop in the unemployment rate over the past year, while welcome and significant, could overstate the degree of improvement in labor market conditions, in part because of the decline in the labor force participation rate. However, a few participants offered reasons why recent readings on the unemployment rate might provide an accurate assessment, on balance, of the extent of improvement in the labor market. For instance, if the decline in labor force participation reflected decisions to retire, it was unlikely to be reversed, because retirees were unlikely to return to the labor force. Furthermore, a secular decline in labor market dynamism, or turnover, might have contributed to a reduction in the size of normal monthly payroll gains. Finally, revised data showed that the historical relationship between real GDP growth and changes in the unemployment rate had remained broadly in place in recent years, suggesting that the unemployment rate continued to provide a reasonably accurate signal about the strength of the labor market and the degree of slack in the economy. Available information suggested that inflation remained subdued and below the Committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent. Similarly, longer-run inflation expectations remained stable and, by some measures, below 2 percent. Financial conditions eased notably over the intermeeting period, with declines in longer-term interest rates and increases in equity values. Financial quotes suggested that markets moved out the date at which they expected to see the Committee first increase the federal funds rate target. It was noted that interest rate volatility was substantially lower than at the time of the September meeting, and a couple of participants pointed to signs suggesting that reaching-for-yield behavior might be increasing again. Nevertheless, term premiums appeared to only partially retrace their rise of earlier in the year, and longer-term interest rates remained well above their levels in the spring. A few participants expressed concerns about the eventual economic impact of the change in financial conditions since the spring; in particular, increases in mortgage rates and home prices had reduced the affordability of housing, and the higher rates were at least partly responsible for some slowing in that sector. One participant stated that the extended period of near-zero interest rates continued to create challenges for the banking industry, as net interest margins remained under pressure. Policy Planning After an introductory briefing by the staff, meeting participants had a wide-ranging discussion of topics related to the path of monetary policy over the medium term, including strategic and communication issues associated with the Committee's asset purchase program as well as possibilities for clarifying or strengthening its forward guidance for the federal funds rate. In this context, participants discussed the financial market response to the Committee's decisions at its June and September meetings and, more generally, the complexities associated with communications about the Committee's current policy tools. A number of participants noted that recent movements in interest rates and other indicators suggested that financial markets viewed the Committee's tools--asset purchases and forward guidance regarding the federal funds rate--as closely linked. One possible explanation for this view was an inference on the part of investors that a change in asset purchases reflected a change in the Committee's outlook for the economy, which would be associated with adjustments in both the purchase program and the expected path of policy rates; another was a perspective that a change in asset purchases would be read as providing information about the willingness of the Committee to pursue its economic objectives with both tools. A couple of participants observed that the decision at the September FOMC meeting might have strengthened the credibility of monetary policy, as suggested by the downward shift in the expected path of short-term interest rates that had brought the path more closely into alignment with the Committee's forward guidance. Participants broadly endorsed making the Committee's communications as simple, clear, and consistent as possible, and discussed ways of doing so. With regard to the asset purchase program, one suggestion was to repeat a set of principles in public communications; for example, participants could emphasize that the program was data dependent, that any reduction in the pace of purchases would depend on both the cumulative progress in labor markets since the start of the program as well as the outlook for future gains, and that a continuing assessment of the efficacy and costs of asset purchases might lead the Committee to decide at some point to change the mix of its policy tools while maintaining a high degree of accommodation. Another suggestion for enhancing communications was to use the Summary of Economic Projections to provide more information about participants' views. During this general discussion of policy strategy and tactics, participants reviewed issues specific to the Committee's asset purchase program. They generally expected that the data would prove consistent with the Committee's outlook for ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and would thus warrant trimming the pace of purchases in coming months. However, participants also considered scenarios under which it might, at some stage, be appropriate to begin to wind down the program before an unambiguous further improvement in the outlook was apparent. A couple of participants thought it premature to focus on this latter eventuality, observing that the purchase program had been effective and that more time was needed to assess the outlook for the labor market and inflation; moreover, international comparisons suggested that the Federal Reserve's balance sheet retained ample capacity relative to the scale of the U.S. economy. Nonetheless, some participants noted that, if the Committee were going to contemplate cutting purchases in the future based on criteria other than improvement in the labor market outlook, such as concerns about the efficacy or costs of further asset purchases, it would need to communicate effectively about those other criteria. In those circumstances, it might well be appropriate to offset the effects of reduced purchases by undertaking alternative actions to provide accommodation at the same time. Participants generally expressed reservations about the possibility of introducing a simple mechanical rule that would adjust the pace of asset purchases automatically based on a single variable such as the unemployment rate or payroll employment. While some were open to considering such a rule, others viewed that approach as unlikely to reliably produce appropriate policy outcomes. As an alternative, some participants mentioned that it might be preferable to adopt an even simpler plan and announce a total size of remaining purchases or a timetable for winding down the program. A calendar-based step-down would run counter to the data-dependent, state-contingent nature of the current asset purchase program, but it would be easier to communicate and might help the public separate the Committee's purchase program from its policy for the federal funds rate and the overall stance of policy. With regard to future reductions in asset purchases, participants discussed how those might be split across asset classes. A number of participants believed that making roughly equal adjustments to purchases of Treasury securities and MBS would be appropriate and relatively straightforward to communicate to the public. However, some others indicated that they could back trimming the pace of Treasury purchases more rapidly than those of MBS, perhaps to signal an intention to support mortgage markets, and one participant thought that trimming MBS first would reduce the potential for distortions in credit allocation. As part of the planning discussion, participants also examined several possibilities for clarifying or strengthening the forward guidance for the federal funds rate, including by providing additional information about the likely path of the rate either after one of the economic thresholds in the current guidance was reached or after the funds rate target was eventually raised from its current, exceptionally low level. A couple of participants favored simply reducing the 6-1/2 percent unemployment rate threshold, but others noted that such a change might raise concerns about the durability of the Committee's commitment to the thresholds. Participants also weighed the merits of stating that, even after the unemployment rate dropped below 6-1/2 percent, the target for the federal funds rate would not be raised so long as the inflation rate was projected to run below a given level. In general, the benefits of adding this kind of quantitative floor for inflation were viewed as uncertain and likely to be rather modest, and communicating it could present challenges, but a few participants remained favorably inclined toward it. Several participants concluded that providing additional qualitative information on the Committee's intentions regarding the federal funds rate after the unemployment threshold was reached could be more helpful. Such guidance could indicate the range of information that the Committee would consider in evaluating when it would be appropriate to raise the federal funds rate. Alternatively, the policy statement could indicate that even after the first increase in the federal funds rate target, the Committee anticipated keeping the rate below its longer-run equilibrium value for some time, as economic headwinds were likely to diminish only slowly. Other factors besides those headwinds were also mentioned as possibly providing a rationale for maintaining a low trajectory for the federal funds rate, including following through on a commitment to support the economy by maintaining more-accommodative policy for longer. These or other modifications to the forward guidance for the federal funds rate could be implemented in the future, either to improve clarity or to add to policy accommodation, perhaps in conjunction with a reduction in the pace of asset purchases as part of a rebalancing of the Committee's tools. Participants also discussed a range of possible actions that could be considered if the Committee wished to signal its intention to keep short-term rates low or reinforce the forward guidance on the federal funds rate. For example, most participants thought that a reduction by the Board of Governors in the interest rate paid on excess reserves could be worth considering at some stage, although the benefits of such a step were generally seen as likely to be small except possibly as a signal of policy intentions. By contrast, participants expressed a range of concerns about using open market operations aimed at affecting the expected path of short-term interest rates, such as a standing purchase facility for shorter-term Treasury securities or the provision of term funding through repurchase agreements. Among the concerns voiced was that such operations would inhibit price discovery and remove valuable sources of market information; in addition, such operations might be difficult to explain to the public, complicate the Committee's communications, and appear inconsistent with the economic thresholds for the federal funds rate. Nevertheless, a number of participants noted that such operations were worthy of further study or saw them as potentially helpful in some circumstances. At the end of the discussion, participants agreed that it would be helpful to continue reviewing these issues of longer-run policy strategy at upcoming meetings. No decisions on the substance were taken, and participants generally noted the usefulness of planning for various contingencies. Committee Policy Action Committee members saw the information received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that economic activity was continuing to expand at a moderate pace. Although indicators of labor market conditions had shown some further improvement, the unemployment rate remained elevated. Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, but the recovery in the housing sector slowed somewhat in recent months, and fiscal policy was restraining economic growth. The Committee expected that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth would pick up from its recent pace, resulting in a gradual decline in the unemployment rate toward levels consistent with the Committee's dual mandate. Members generally continued to see the downside risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as having diminished, on net, since last fall. Inflation was running below the Committee's longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations were stable, and the Committee anticipated that inflation would move back toward its objective over the medium term. Members recognized, however, that inflation persistently below the Committee's 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance. In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members generally noted that there had been little change in the economic outlook since the September meeting, and all members but one again judged that it would be appropriate for the Committee to await more evidence that progress toward its economic objectives would be sustained before adjusting the pace of asset purchases. In the view of one member, the cumulative improvement in the economy indicated that the continued easing of monetary policy at the current pace was no longer necessary. Many members stressed the data-dependent nature of the current asset purchase program, and some pointed out that, if economic conditions warranted, the Committee could decide to slow the pace of purchases at one of its next few meetings. A couple of members also commented that it would be important to continue laying the groundwork for such a reduction in pace through public statements and speeches, while emphasizing that the overall stance of monetary policy would remain highly accommodative as needed to meet the Committee's objectives. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee decided to continue adding policy accommodation by purchasing additional MBS at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month and to maintain its existing reinvestment policies. In addition, the Committee reaffirmed its intention to keep the target federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and retained its forward guidance that it anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored. Members also discussed the wording of the policy statement to be issued following the meeting. In addition to updating its description of the state of the economy, the Committee considered whether to note that the effects of the temporary government shutdown had made economic conditions more difficult to assess, but judged that this might overemphasize the role of the shutdown in the Committee's policy deliberations. Members noted the improvement in financial conditions since the time of the September meeting and agreed that it was appropriate to drop the reference, which was included in the September statement, to the tightening of financial conditions seen over the summer. Members also discussed whether to add to the forward guidance in the policy statement an indication that the headwinds restraining the economic recovery were likely to abate only gradually, with the federal funds rate target anticipated to remain below its longer-run normal value for a considerable time. While there was some support for adding this language at some stage, a range of concerns were expressed about including it at this meeting. In particular, given its complexity, many members felt that it would be difficult to communicate this point succinctly in the statement. In addition, there was not complete consensus within the Committee that headwinds were the only explanation for the low expected future path of policy rates. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: "Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability. In particular, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to 1/4 percent. The Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain such conditions. The Desk is directed to continue purchasing longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of about $45 billion per month and to continue purchasing agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of about $40 billion per month. The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency mortgage-backed securities transactions. The Committee directs the Desk to maintain its policy of rolling over maturing Treasury securities into new issues and its policy of reinvesting principal payments on all agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities. The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability." The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: "Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September generally suggests that economic activity has continued to expand at a moderate pace. Indicators of labor market conditions have shown some further improvement, but the unemployment rate remains elevated. Available data suggest that household spending and business fixed investment advanced, while the recovery in the housing sector slowed somewhat in recent months. Fiscal policy is restraining economic growth. Apart from fluctuations due to changes in energy prices, inflation has been running below the Committee's longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth will pick up from its recent pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. The Committee sees the downside risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as having diminished, on net, since last fall. The Committee recognizes that inflation persistently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance, but it anticipates that inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term. Taking into account the extent of federal fiscal retrenchment over the past year, the Committee sees the improvement in economic activity and labor market conditions since it began its asset purchase program as consistent with growing underlying strength in the broader economy. However, the Committee decided to await more evidence that progress will be sustained before adjusting the pace of its purchases. Accordingly, the Committee decided to continue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. Taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the Committee's dual mandate. The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability. In judging when to moderate the pace of asset purchases, the Committee will, at its coming meetings, assess whether incoming information continues to support the Committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective. Asset purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee's decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the Committee's economic outlook as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens. In particular, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored. In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent." Voting for this action:Â Ben Bernanke, William C. Dudley, James Bullard, Charles L. Evans, Jerome H. Powell, Eric Rosengren, Jeremy C. Stein, Daniel K. Tarullo, and Janet L. Yellen. Voting against this action:Â Esther L. George. Ms. George dissented because she did not see the continued aggressive easing of monetary policy as warranted in the face of both actual and forecasted improvements in the economy. In her view, the cumulative progress in labor markets justified taking steps toward slowing the pace of the Committee's asset purchases. Moreover, market expectations for the size of the purchase program had continued to escalate despite that progress, increasing her concerns about communications challenges and the potential costs associated with asset purchases. It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday-Wednesday, December 17-18, 2013. The meeting adjourned at 12:05 p.m. on October 30, 2013. Notation VoteBy notation vote completed on October 8, 2013, the Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the FOMC meeting held on September 17-18, 2013. Videoconference meeting of October 16On October 16, 2013, the Committee met by video-conference to discuss issues associated with contingencies in the event that the Treasury was temporarily unable to meet its obligations because the statutory federal debt limit was not raised. The meeting covered issues similar to those discussed at the Committee's videoconference meeting of August 1, 2011. The staff provided an update on legislative developments bearing on the debt ceiling and the funding of the federal government, recent conditions in financial markets, technical aspects of the processing of federal payments, potential implications for bank supervision and regulatory policies, and possible actions that the Federal Reserve could take if disruptions to market functioning posed a threat to the Federal Reserve's economic objectives. Meeting participants saw no legal or operational need in the event of delayed payments on Treasury securities to make changes to the conduct or procedures employed in currently authorized Desk operations, such as open market operations, large-scale asset purchases, or securities lending, or to the operation of the discount window. They also generally agreed that the Federal Reserve would continue to employ prevailing market values of securities in all its transactions and operations, under the usual terms. With respect to potential additional actions, participants noted that the appropriate responses would depend importantly on the actual conditions observed in financial markets. Under certain circumstances, the Desk might act to facilitate the smooth transmission of monetary policy through money markets and to address disruptions in market functioning and liquidity. Supervisory policy would take into account and make appropriate allowance for unusual market conditions. The need to maintain the traditional separation of the Federal Reserve's actions from the Treasury's debt management decisions was noted. Participants agreed that while the Federal Reserve should take whatever steps it could, the risks posed to the financial system and to the broader economy by a delay in payments on Treasury securities would be potentially catastrophic, and thus such a situation should be avoided at all costs. --------------- EARLIER:Â Heads up! We are minutes away from the minutes from Federal Open Market Committee's October meeting. The wording of the statement released at the end of that meeting on October 30 was little changed from that of the statement released at the conclusion of the September FOMC meeting. In September, the FOMC surprised market participants by refraining from announcing a first tapering of its quantitative easing program â€” under which the Federal Reserve buys $85 billion of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities each month â€” justifying its decision on the grounds that economic data had not improved enough to warrant tapering. Following the September decision, the consensus expectation for the timing of the first tapering announcement was pushed all the way out to the March FOMC meeting, especially in light of the government shutdown that spanned the first half of October. Notably absent from the October statement, however, was any acknowledgment from the FOMC that the shutdown would weigh on the economy, such that a tapering announcement would be pushed back even further. This omission from the statement, along with subsequent economic data releases that largely suggested the economy shrugged off the shutdown in October, has brought a tapering announcement at either the December or January meetings back into the discussion. Today's release of the minutes of the October meeting could shed more light on how close the FOMC is to tapering.
REUTERS/Mike BlakeEarlier this morning we saw that existing home sales fell 3.2% in October to an annualized pace of 5.12 million units. Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist, pointed out that sales had fallen in part because of erosion in purchasing power and low inventory that were causing home prices to climb. Deutsche Bank's Joseph LaVorgna pointed out that the "quality" of existing inventory also weighed on sales. But he attributed the fall in existing home sales to rising mortgage rates as well. The 30-year fixed rate stands at 4.35%, according to the latest Freddie Mac survey, but mortgage rates have been running up since May and the 30-year was as high as 4.58% in August. Finally, NAR and LaVorgna pointed to the impact of the upcoming Qualified Residential Mortgage rules that "will require a lot more time, documentation and scrutiny to process loans," according to NAR.Â  "Lenders may be hesitating in order to ensure compliance with the new measures which take effect in January of next year," said LaVorgna. "In general, lending standards for anything other than prime mortgages remain relatively restrictive."
Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesA 61-year-old has filed a lawsuit claiming Bank of America lost his mortgage payment and then harassed him so much he had a heart attack, WSOC-TV Charlotte reports. After his mortgage was lost, John Stecher allegedly started getting calls from bank employees who warned him that his "credit history would be negatively impacted." They also said he was "in jeopardy of foreclosure," according to the lawsuit. Stecher says he finally went to the bank and begged the manager to find his payment. He then became short of breath and had to be rushed to the hospital, according to WSOC-TV. He was in good health before that day, and his doctors blamed the attack on stress, the lawsuit alleges. His lawyer, Paul Goodson, told the TV station that his client is suing for "any amount to get their attention to pay more attention to their customers and their own mistakes." Bank of America had no comment on the suit, according to WSOC-TV.
M. Wells Steakhouse, the new Long Island City restaurant opened by chef Hugue Dufour and spouse Sarah Obraitis was bound to be different â€” that's what the duo is known for. And M. Wells is different. So different, that it requires a different review for two kinds of steak eaters â€” those who just love a good cut at any restaurant, and those who love steakhouses. After all, Doufour himself said that he was worried about opening a steakhouse. â€œPeople have strong opinions," he told New York Magazine. He couldn't be more right. I'll start with the basics. The restaurant is located in an old garage not far from MOMA PS1, but the vibe is warm. Not the old timey warmth you get from a steakhouse but the warm feeling you get when stepping into a room of friends you can wear t-shirts and sneakers with.  Now â€” to the steak eaters. This restaurant is different, but you will like it. You will like the open, bustling kitchen. You will like that the most expensive cocktail is a $15 â€” most are $10. You will like that the grilled lobster comes with sauce on it (we definitely did). Absolutely try the bone marrow and escargot. Absolutely try M. Wells' baked potato side dish bubbling with cheese and bacon. Absolutely try the 'beef butter', a fatty, almost spreadable cut of meat that tastes like a savory steak dessert. You will love all of that. Stay away from the foie gras gnocchi, though (sorry, it had so much promise, we know). The gnocchi itself is too thick, and the foie gras doesn't stay inside from bite to bite. Above all of that, the steak is excellent. We had the Chateaubriand for two. There was a ton of charred, delicious flavor on the edges. It was juicy and it was worth a trip to Queens. Now â€” to the steakhouse purists. The major problem with M. Wells is the choice of side dishes. A true steakhouse lover needs creamed spinach, yearns for macaroni and cheese, and will savor a fresh beefsteak tomato in their dreams. You will find none of that on M. Wells' menu as it is. The oysters were amazing, yes, but it's debatable whether steakhouse purists will want their lobster sauce decided for them on a seafood platter (though that's likely something one can request). What a steakhouse purist will like, though, is that any request will come easy. M. Wells' service is friendly and attentive (major shouts to Aaron, our server, who without our asking let us try a great Burgundy Pinot Noir). Steakhouse lovers need a waitstaff that memorizes their name, address, birthday, and social security number. M. Wells has the potential to deliver that for its regulars. And again, the steak was delicious â€” that's the bottom line here. But if you're a steakhouse purist, and you don't come into this spot with an open mind, you're going to have a side dish-sized hole in your heart when you leave M. Wells. That's the word.
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus released a draft proposal yesterday for reforming the U.S. corporate tax code. In it, he proposed lowering the current corporate rate from 35% to less than 30% (he didn't specify an exact rate). In a perfect world, we would eliminate the corporate income tax altogether. Here's why: 1. Corporate taxes don't collect much revenue. Here's a look at how much revenue we get as share of GDP over time:  We collect around 2 percent of GDP in revenues from the corporate income tax each year. That's not nothing ($320 billion), but it's not much given that after-tax corporate profits were almost $2 trillion in 2012. Here's what what you're thinking:Â Eliminating more than $300 billion in revenue would leave a gaping hole in the budget. That's why reforming the entire tax code is so important. In addition to eliminating the corporate income tax, we would... 2. ...tax capital gains and dividends at the normal tax rates. One of the reasons that there is a special exemption in the first place is due to double taxation. Corporate profits are taxed once and then the dividends and capital gains to shareholders are taxed yet another time. Whenever anyone proposes eliminating this exemption, executives start yelling about double taxation. And they're right! However, if we eliminate the corporate tax, which we've already shown collects considerably less revenue than its 35% rate implies, we can tax capital gains and dividends as normal income. This won't make up all of the lost revenue, but there are other ways to get there. We can raise the payroll tax cap, implement a carbon tax or a number of other different things. 3. One of the best reasons for doing this is that the corporate tax is not necessarily progressive. Research is mixed on who actually pays the corporate income tax - shareholders or employees. After all, the tax ultimately comes from someone's wallet. Most economists agree that at least some of it is passed on to workers. Some believe that workers actually pay the majority of it. If we replaced the corporate tax with taxes targeted at the wealthiest individuals, we could actually make the tax system more progressive. 4. Corporations also waste huge amounts of resources funneling money into tax lawyers and lobbyists to find ways to reduce their tax bill. Eliminating the corporate income tax would allow these companies to invest those resources back into the company where they can be put to better use. 5. The current system disadvantages new firms. Right now, U.S. corporates pay the highest tax rate in the world at 39.6% once state taxes are factored, but U.S. companies have gotten particularly good at paying a much lower rate. However, new companies are not nearly as well versed is corporate tax law. In order to compete with current firms, those companies must invest not just in their development, but also in lawyers to reduce their tax bill as well. Without them, they may not be able to compete. The combination of a high corporate rate and a huge number of loopholes is an impediment to new firms. 6. It can also make our financial system safer. This comes from Megan McArdle. Since debt payments are deductible, this incentivized firms to finance investments using debt over equity. Doing so inherently makes them risky. Getting rid of the corporate income tax would remove this incentive. We can make our tax system more progressive, our economy more competitive and more efficient, and our financial system safer by eliminating the corporate income tax and replacing the lost revenue with taxes aimed at high earners. It also should have political appeal on both the left and right since the left will support the increased progressivity and the right the elimination of the tax altogether.
As stocks in the U.S. have been hitting all-time highs, some are wondering if there is a major correction coming. BlackRock chief investment strategist Russ Koesterich points out that emerging market stocks still look cheap â€” considering their potential for growth and improved corporate profits â€” especially when compared with U.S. stocks. From BlacRock: "Despite the recent emerging market stock rebound, EM equities were still trading at a 36% discount to U.S. stocks, and below their three-year average valuation, as of October 10, 2013, as measured by price-to-book ratios." Earlier this year, BlackRock's Jeff Shen and Rodolfo Martell argued that "for investors who want to develop their portfolios, the developing world is an unmatched source of potential." Koesterich likes emerging market stocks over the next three to five years. BlackRock
Goldman Sachs / YouTubeGoldman Sachs just released itsÂ 10 market themes for 2014, and now the bank's top economists are holding a conference call with clients about their forecasts for next year and beyond. Chief economist Jan Hatzius explained that Goldman Sachs' 2014 growth forecast for U.S. GDP is 2.9%, above the consensus estimate. While the "repeated false starts of the past few years" serve as a reminder of how difficult economic forecasting can be, Hatzius says he believes that this time around we have a "clear reduction in the fiscal drag by about one percentage point."Â  Basically, Hatzius says that if the private sector can perform like it has this year, 2014 will be stronger given the "ease" of public drag. On the topic of interest rates, Hatzius highlighted the fact that the Yellen Fed will continue to look to employment figures before making major monetary policy changes. And U.S. employment is still "far too low." Check out the chart: Goldman Sachs There has been "some fiscal relief in Europe," with the recession there ending. But Hatzius noted that incremental reduction in fiscal drag in 2014 will be slower in Europe than in the U.S. On emerging markets, Goldman's Dominic Wilson says that 2014 will show some modest growth after the slowing we've seen recently. But growth acceleration will not be as sharp as in developed markets. Wilson said that we'll see more differentiation among EM nations in 2014. But the more an EM country is tied into developed markets in terms of exports and the like, the more it will benefit from 2014 growth. After a severe downgrade in the market's views on China this year, Wilson says that some new signs of stability there may reassure investors. Wilson also believes that equity markets have not yet priced in the kind of growth we'll see in 2014 (in part, that's because Goldman's growth view is above consensus). But Wilson argues that the market won't really "believe" the recovery until it "sees" it â€” perhaps from the kind of GDP readings Goldman thinks will happen.
Flickr/ToastyKenGoldman Sachs economic team is out with its own listicle, the Top Ten Market Themes for 2014. The 10 points "represent a broad list of macro themes from our economic outlook that we think will dominate markets in 2014." Here they are, with the key quotes pulled from the note. 1. Showtime for the US/DM Recovery Our 2013 outlook was dominated by the notion that underlying private- sector healing in the US was being masked by significant fiscal drag. As we move into 2014 and that drag eases, we expect the long-awaited shift towards above-trend growth in the US finally to occur, spurred by an acceleration in private consumption and business investment. 2. Forward guidance harder in an above-trend world Despite the improvement in growth, we expect G4 central banks to continue to signal that rates are set to remain on hold near the zero bound for a prolonged period, faced with low inflation and high unemployment. In the US, our forecast is still for no hikes until 2016 and we expect the commitment to low rates to be reinforced in the next few months. 3. Earn the DM equity risk premium, hedge the risk  Over the past few years, we have seen very large risk premium compression across a wide range of areas. While not at 2007 levels, credit spreads have narrowed to below long-term averages and asset market volatility has fallen. Even in a friendly growth and policy environment such as the one we anticipate, this is likely to make for lower return prospects (although more appealing in a volatility-adjusted sense). In equities, in particular, the key question we confront is whether a rally can continue given above-average multiples. We think it can. Â  4. Good carry, bad carry Our 2014 forecast of improving but still slightly below-trend global growth and anchored inflation describes an environment in which overall volatility may justifiably be lower. Markets have already moved a long way in this direction, but equity volatility has certainly been lower in prior cycles and forward pricing of volatility is still firmly higher than spot levels. In an environment of subdued macro volatility, the desire to earn carry is likely to remain strong, particularly if it remains hard to envisage significant upside to the growth picture.Â  5. The race to the exit kicks off 2013 has already seen some EM central banks move to policy tightening. As the US growth picture improves â€“ and the pressure on global rates builds â€“ the focus on who may tighten monetary policy is likely to increase. As we described recently (Global Economics Weekly 13/33), the market is pricing a relatively synchronised exit among the major developed markets, even though their recovery profiles look different. Given that the timing of the first hike has commonly been judged to be some way off, this lack of differentiation is not particularly unusual. But the separation of those who are likely to move early and those who may move later is likely to begin in earnest in 2014.Â  6. Decision time for the â€˜high-flyersâ€™ A number of smaller open economies have imported easy monetary policy from the US and Europe in recent years, in part to offset currency strength and in part to compensate for a weaker external environment. In a number of these places (Norway, Switzerland, Israel, Canada and, to a lesser extent, New Zealand and Sweden), house prices have appreciated and/or credit growth has picked up. Central banks have generally tolerated those signs of emerging pressure given the external growth risks and the desire to avoid currency strength through a tighter policy stance. As the developed market growth picture improves, some of these â€˜high flyersâ€™ may reassess the balance of risks on this front.Â  7. Still not your older brotherâ€™s EM...  2013 has proved to be a tough year for EM assets. 2014 is unlikely to see the same level of broad-based pressure. The combination of a sharp downgrade to expectations of China growth and risk alongside the worries about a hawkish Fed during the summer â€˜taper tantrumâ€™ are unlikely to be repeated with the same level of intensity.Â  8. ...but EM differentiation to continue 2013 saw countries with high current account deficits, high inflation, weak institutions and limited DM exposure punished much more heavily than the â€˜DMs of EMsâ€™, which had stronger current accounts and institutions, underheated economies and greater DM exposure. This is still likely to be the primary axis of differentiation in coming months, but in 2014 we would also expect to see greater differentiation within both these categories.Â  9. Commodity downside risks grow Last year we pointed to the ongoing shift in our commodity views, ultimately towards downside price risk. The impact of supply responses to the period of extraordinary price pressure continues to flow through the system. And we are forecasting significant declines (15%+) through 2014 in gold, copper, iron ore and soybeans. Energy prices clearly matter most for the global outlook. Here our views are more stable, although downside risk is growing over time and production losses out of Libya/Iran and other geopolitical risk is now playing a large role in keeping prices high.Â  10. Stable China may be good enoughÂ   Expectations of Chinese growth have reset meaningfully lower as some of the medium-term problems around credit growth, shadow financing and local governance have been widely recognised over the past year. Some of these issues continue to linger: the risks from the credit overhang remain and policymakers are unlikely to be comfortable allowing growth to accelerate much. But the deep deceleration of mid-2013 has reversed and even our forecast of essentially flat growth (of about 7.5%) may be enough to comfort investors relative to their worst fears.Â 
London forex dealers are texting client orders to day traders in nearby towns to make possibly illegal personal prop bets, Bloomberg's Ambereen Choudhury, Liam Vaughan &amp; Gavin Finch report. The dealers would transmit details of the orders to individuals who'd rented trading desks in towns like Kent and Essex an hour outside London. The dealers also used instant messaging. Once armed with the clients' positions, the day traders would make bets on currency directions, and would split any profits in cash with the dealers.  One of the sources said he'd witnessed a day trader hand over a cash-filled envelope to his corporate counterpart in the parking lot of an Essex bar. Bloomberg cites three unnamed traders who had witnessed the practice over the course of several years.  "[This] shows the extent to which dealers would go to circumvent rules designed to stop them from profiting at the expense of clients, and how alleged wrongdoing in the foreign-exchange market stretched beyond the trading floors of London’s financial district to unregulated day traders in Essex and Kent," Bloomberg writes. “It’s almost impossible for banks to have a lid on it –- unless they find a way of controlling all forms of communication out of the trading floor,” they quote Tom Kirchmaier, a fellow in the financial-markets group at the London School of Economics, as saying. Bloomberg says regulators are already probing the issue. The practice echoes the rigging of worldwide benchmark interest rates through traders illicitly sharing their positions.

Let's assume you think the stock market is about to stumble, and stumble badly. How can you see the top coming? Some argue the top is already staring everyone in the face. The Dow Jones industrials were up 21.15 percent for the year as of Thursday's close, with the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index up 25.6 percent and the Nasdaq Composite Index up some 31.6%. Since the 2009 market bottom, the Dow is up 143 percent, with the S&amp;P 500 sporting a 165-percent gain. The Nasdaq, meanwhile, has jumped 213 percent. But that doesn't necessarily mean a top is near. In fact, the Dow produced gains every year from 1991 through 1999. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq were up eight of those nine years. But by the end of that run, it was clear to a lot of people that trouble was brewing, thanks to what can only be described as insanity in tech stocks. The dot-com bubble sent the Nasdaq soaring nearly 86 percent in 1999 alone, and 571 percent between the end of 1994 and 1999. Anyone with even a hint of an idea could launch an IPO. The aftermath, as we all know, was horrible. The Nasdaq peaked in March 2000 and then fell 78 percent over the next two years. It's still more than 1,000 under its 2000 peak. Besides huge gains, a number of indicators can suggest -- but not guarantee -- that a slump is just around the corner. Here are some of the most useful: Relative Strength Indexes. A relative strength index is an esoteric measure of momentum, but it's watched carefully. You can find them in the charting tools of most major websites. A 14-day RSI is the most common measure. If it is above 70 or 75, the stock or index is likely overbought. If it is below 30, it's oversold. When the market peaked in in late 1999 and the first quarter of 2000, the Nasdaq's RSI reached as high as 86. That was a screaming sell signal. After the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks the Nasdaq's RSI fell to as low as 15.4 -- a screaming buy signal, but not a perfect buy signal. The Nasdaq actually fell an additional 26 percent before a bottom held in October 2002. On Thursday, the RSIs for the Dow and S&amp;P 500 were about 66, close to an overbought level. Moving Averages. These are simple ways to look at price compared with a longer trend. 50-day and 200-day moving averages are useful. The first offers a quick sense of investor confidence. The 200-day moving average (some prefer a 150-day average) suggests longer-term direction. A stock moving 10 percent or more above its 200-day moving average is suggest an overbought condition. If a stock or index falls below its 200-day moving average, it is bearish. In March 2009, the Dow, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq were all trading 30 percent or more below their 200-day averages, clear buy signals. On Thursday, the Dow closed nearly six percent above its 200-day average, with the S&amp;P 500 9.4 percent higher than its 200-day average. The Nasdaq finished 13.2 percent above its 200-day average. The Nasdaq is saying it's getting toppy. Price to Earnings Ratios. The standard price earnings ratio measures a price of a stock against earnings. The higher the P/E ratio, the pricier the stock or index. It makes sense. You can look at the price-earnings ratios for indexes as well. The Dow was trading at 17.8 times the past four quarters of earnings of its 30 components, according to The Wall Street Journal on Friday. That was up from 13.7 times its earnings a year ago. The S&amp;P 500 is trading at 18.7 times earnings. The Nasdaq-100 Index is trading at 21.5 times earnings. At the very least, the ratios are signaling that stock prices are rich. Take a look at Robert Shiller's "Cyclically Adjusted Price Earnings ratio" or CAPE. Shiller, a co-winner of this year's Nobel Prize for Economics, looks at the level of the S&amp;P 500 compared with a 10-year average of its price earnings ratio adjusted by the annual change in the consumer price index. (Whew!) But here's why people are paying attention to it. Shiller's data goes back to the 19th century. As of Nov. 1, his CAPE index was at 24.4. How high is that? Before the dot-com bubble burst in 2000, the index had hit 43. It was at 27 in 2007, before the market crash, and it was above 31 in 1928 and 1929, before the great stock market crash hit. The Bond Market Will Have its Say. When Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke suggested this past spring that the Fed might taper its big bond-purchasing program, interest rates promptly moved higher. Housing activity slowed, the economy seemed to lose its early-year mojo and stocks struggled. Pushing rates higher wasn't Bernanke's intent, but often you can't control how traders view a policy change. The Fed and interest rates will play a dominant role in how stocks and the economy perform in the next year. If the 10-year Treasury jumps to, say, 3.5 percent, stocks could be pressured. The 10-year Treasury yield was 2.71 percent on Friday, up from 1.63 percent on May. The yield was at four percent as the crash year of 2008 began. Housing Isn't the Problem. A good argument to suggest a crash is not imminent is housing starts. The Commerce Department tells us that starts hit a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.27 million units in January 2006, just as the housing bubble was peaking. In August 2013, the starts rate was 891,000 units; that is, single-family homes, townhouses or apartments. Yes, housing has been recovering: Starts are up roughly 20 percent from a year ago. But the U.S. market is nowhere near a bubble. The iShares Dow Jones U.S. Home Construction exchange-traded fund (NYSE: ITB), which tracks home builders, jumped 12.9 percent in the first quarter, but worries about economic softness have trimmed the gain to around seven percent. Never Underestimate Oil Prices. The 2008-2009 recession wasn't due just to the real estate bust and the near-collapse of the banking system. The economy, especially the auto makers, were badly hurt by soaring gasoline prices. The national average price of gas topped $4.11 a gallon in July 2008 as crude oil hit $147.27 a gallon. While gasoline today averages about $3.20 a gallon nationally, it nearly reached $4 in the spring of 2011 and early 2012 -- and hit $3.80 in 2013 as crude oil climbed higher on Middle East tensions. Gas-price increases are a tax on consumers, and they responded by trimming spending elsewhere. Gas prices are now at two-year lows, and consumer discretionary and airline stocks have been among the year's top performers. Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX), Best Buy (NYSE: BBY) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL) are three of the top four S&amp;P 500 performers this year.
CNBC/ Brian Steel It's time to settle this once and for all â€” Bloomberg, CNBC or Fox Business? What do you actually watch? Everyone in finance watches TV all day, whether its simply on silently in the background or it's front and center in the middle of breaking news. Because of that, the battle between networks for Wall Street's eyeballs is fierce. Recently, the talent war intensified with money honey Maria Bartiromo leaving her home of 20 years, CNBC, for Fox News. There are some markers of how well Fox Business and CNBC are doing, like Nielsen ratings, but Nielsen doesn't track Bloomberg. Plus, Bloomberg is streamed on terminals, computer screens, phones, and tablets all over the world. In short, we want to hear from you, so Business Insider created a short survey to get a sense of what the Street is really watching. Vote now, and we'll share the results soon. Be honest, this is important:
Bloomberg TelevisionHoward Marks is the founder and chairman of Oaktree Capital Management, a Los Angeles-based firm with approximately $80 billion of primarily fixed-income and distressed assets under management. The "illuminated" edition of his, book, The Most Important Thing, was recently released. It contains comments from notable investors, including Christopher Davis, Joel Greenblatt, Paul Johnson and Seth Klarman. I spoke with Mr. Marks on November 15 at the University of Virginia Investment Conference in Charlottesville, VA. In your book you make the following observations about cycles: â€œRule number one, most things will prove to be cyclical. Rule number two, some of the greatest opportunities for gains and loss come when people forget rule number one.â€ At this time, are people forgetting rule number one in either the equity or the bond market? Tied into that, in your last memo in August, The Role of Confidence, you wrote that we were in the middle ground of the valuation cycle. What has changed since then? That is still true. Markets go up and down, and at the bottom theyâ€™re cheap, and then they rise to fair and then rich. We are in the middle range with regard to U.S. stocks. They have come a long way from the lower range a year and half ago. They are probably up 45% on the S&amp;P from there. I thought they were very cheap at that time, and now they are at fair to full value. Full does not mean over-priced. I think theyâ€™re somewhere in the upper part of the fair territory. All bonds are expensive since interest rates are being held artificially low by the Fedâ€™s bond-buying program. One of these days, I hope, the government will stop holding interest rates down and rates will go up a moderate amount. If the 10-year today is 2.7%, my guess is it is going to go to 3.5% to 4%, but not to 6% right away. Bonds in general are rich. Credit spreads within the bond universe look okay. You are a proponent of second-level thinking. Can you give a short explanation of what that means for the benefit of our readers? It mainly means that you have to understand how securities are valued and how money is made. If you take a simplistic approach you canâ€™t succeed. Second-level thinking says that you have to think different from and better than the crowd. If you think the same as the crowd youâ€™ll have average results. How is money made? If corporate profits grow 6% a year, itâ€™ll be easy to make 6% a year in stock market. But to make more, or to outperform others, you have to think different and better. Money is made when the crowdâ€™s expectation of the future turns out to have been too low, when reality exceeds perception. Obviously, if you are going to make money to an above average extent, you have to see when the crowdâ€™s thinking is off. By definition, if you think like the crowd you canâ€™t know when the crowd is off. As I say in the book, the first-level thinker says, â€œThis is a good company, you should buy the stock.â€ The second-level thinker says, â€œThis is a good company, but not that good. You should sell it because it is up on expectations.â€ Let me give you examples, to see your second-level thoughts on some topics. We will start with high-frequency trading. There are a lot of things that I think canâ€™t work, and yet somebody makes money with most of them. Maybe not enough people make money to refute the belief that these things are random, but somebody makes money. Can you hire a computer to tap into the flow of trading information and make a superior return? You should not be able to, because that should be capable of being arbitraged away, but I understand some people do. They probably make it by finding some tiny abnormality and leveraging it up. If we are talking about a tiny abnormality, then it should not have a profound effect on the market itself. So I donâ€™t worry about it, but then again I am not in equities. Fracking and the so-called energy revolution? I donâ€™t follow it. I donâ€™t have any primary information. A lot of smart people think it is going to move us into the direction of energy sufficiency for a while, and importantly increase our efficiency in manufacturing, and give us an edge. I am not willing to bet the ranch on this producing a brand-new era, but it sounds like a positive. It would be a plus for the stocks that are affected â€“ if it is not already in the price. The first-level thinker says, â€œWhen we reach energy sufficiency, stocks are going to go up.â€ The second-level thinker says, â€œSince we are going to be better off in the future than we are, I will buy some stocks today.â€Â  That bids stocks up and that is how future events are discounted today. Quantitative easing? I may be in the minority on that, because I donâ€™t think it is a big deal, in a sense. There was an article in the papers within the last week talking about fears of quantitative easing. My question is: What are you afraid of? People are concerned that tapering quantitative easing will have two effects.Â  Number one, they are concerned that the economy will slow if we stop simulating it, and number two, they are afraid that interest rates will go up. On the first, I believe a Yellen-led Fed will be a dovish Fed, which is interested in producing growth. I donâ€™t think they are going to remove the patient from the breathing machine until theyâ€™re sure he can breathe for himself. If the fear is that growth will slow, the Fed is going to do everything it can to make sure that in the environment in which they remove QE, the economy will grow on its own. Number two, if people are afraid interest rates will go up, my answer would be, â€œYes that is right; get used to it, because todayâ€™s interest rates are artificially low.â€ Herb Stein, the great economist said, â€œIf something cannot continue it will stop.â€ Artificially low interest rates cannot continue forever. They will stop. Rates will probably rise. If you agree with that, and I think it is all true, then it means that you have to accept that it is going to happen.Â  What is the difference when it happens? People say it will happen in December or March. What is the difference between the two if it is going to happen? I am never very fixated on timing of events. When I was an equity analyst you would get reports and they would say things such as, â€œI like it for the long term not the short term, or I like it for the short term not the long term.â€ How do you know? If you think somethingâ€™s going to go up, how do you know whether it is going to happen in the short term or the long term? Either you like it or you donâ€™t, it seems to me. If you think interest rates are going to go up, what does it matter whether they go up in December or March? If you think they are going to go up in March, wouldnâ€™t it be stupid to plan on holding bonds from now until February in the expectation that you are smart enough to avoid the effect in March? Number one, it may happen in February instead and surprise you. And number two, if it happens in March it may be anticipated in February, bringing markdowns while youâ€™re holding. So I just donâ€™t see the big deal. Read the rest at Advisor Perspectives Â»
APMax BaucusSenate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus (D-MT) has been working diligently in recent months in anticipation of an overhaul of the U.S. tax code. In recent weeks though, momentum for tax reform has slowed considerably with Republican leadership asking Baucus's counterpart in the House, Dave Camp (R-MI), to put his legislation on hold. Nevertheless, Baucus is moving ahead with his plans and yesterday released a draft proposal. Here's what's in it: Corporate Tax Rate - Reduce to under 30%, from current 35%- Prevents companies from shifting income from intangible property to low tax jurisdictions
REUTERS/Brian SnyderTapering is "on the table" for the next FOMC meeting, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said today at Bloomberg's "The Year Ahead: 2014" conference. If the Fed sees a strong November jobs report, the central bank might decide to taper its $85 billion a month asset purchasing program at its next meeting. The question, Bullard said, is whether the jobs pickup is sustainable. Bullard said that QE is working as effectively as it ever has, adding that he didn't buy the argument that QE has diminishing returns. In terms of his overall economic outlook, Bullard said that things are looking better, with GDP "revised up some."
YouTube/Consumer ReportsTesla is down 4% to $120.85. The stock is falling as Barclays' analyst Brian Johnson lowered his price target on the stock to $120 from $141. Moreover, Johnson pointed out that a look back at other high profile investigations and recalls suggest that sales could fall 10-20%. Tesla's stock has been taking a beating after there were three fires on its Model S sedan since October.Traders also punished Tesla after the company missed analyst expectations on vehicle deliveries of the Model S in its Q3 earnings report. CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly defended Tesla's record saying the fires were not spontaneous but took place after collisions with foreign objects. The National Highway Traffic Administration has opened a probe in Tesla's battery fires. The stock is well off its September 30 closing high of $193.37. Musk has previously said he thinks the stock is overvalued. Here's a look at how the stock has been over the last 5 days.Google Finance
REUTERS/Tobias Schwarz With the Dow Jones industrial average flirting with 16,000, hedge fund managers that focus on betting against stocks see a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make money on what they see as an epic equity bubble. "This is it. It's the bottom of the ninth and we're about to hit a home run," said John Fichthorn, co-founder of Dialectic Capital Management and an expert on shorting stocks. "I believe this is the best opportunity I will see in my life as a short seller." Virtually every other so-called short-biased hedge fund agrees, practically jumping up and down to alert investors of the opportunity to make money when the stock market falls significantly. The question, of course, is when and if the managers can survive as businesses long enough to see the big returns they are so convinced are coming. Several hedge funds that focus on betting against the market have decided to shut down recently. They include Russell Faucett's Barrington Partners, Jaime Lester's Soundpost Partners and, as previously reported, Marc Andersen and Eliav Assouline's Axial Capital Management, a Tiger Management seed. Faucett, Lester and a representative for Axial declined to comment. The average short-biased hedge fund is down 16.87 percent this year through October, according to institutional investment data provider eVestment. The funds gained an average of 10.40 percent in 2007 and 31.97 percent in 2008, but lost 22.81 percent in 2009, 12.94 percent in 2010 and 13.17 percent in 2012 (they did rise 1.21 percent in 2011). "The past several years have been challenging for short-biased funds, owing primarily to quantitative easing and the resulting surfeit of liquidity-creating valuation distortions," said Scott Schweighauser, president and portfolio manager at $9 billion fund of hedge funds Aurora Investment Management. "That being said, Aurora believes that investors are now incorporating the view that QE will soon diminish, and are, therefore, recalibrating their own expectations with more realistic cost-of-capital assumptions," added Schweighauser, a longtime short allocator. "We think that this will lead to robust dispersion amongst equities, and great alpha opportunities for investors' long and short portfolios. We are seeing much better returns coming from our short-biased managers in the last six to eight weeks, reflecting this new market dynamic." Beside poor performance, short-biased hedge funds were slammed by the collapse of one of the their biggest allocators: Common Sense Investment Management. Virtually all investors fled the once-$3.2 billion fund of funds Common Sense after the arrest of founder Jim Bisenius for soliciting a prostitute. Common Sense was forced to request its money from all its hedge fund managers by year-end as a result of its investors requesting their capital back. Common Sense had for years been a top allocator to short-biased hedge funds and earned a reputation for thoughtful selection of hedge fund managers, especially small short-biased start-ups hungry to prove themselves. Common Sense had money with the three firms shutting: Axial, Soundpost and Barrington, according to people familiar with the situation. And the Portland, Ore.-based firm also had money with many remaining short-focused firms, including Fichthorn's Dialectic, Matt Kliber's Gracian Capital and Dave Davidson's SC Management, according to the people. "Common Sense was the straw that broke the back of the marginal short-selling fund. They were the most thoughtful guys left in the fund of funds space in terms of allocating to smaller short-focused managers," said one of the fund managers who Common Sense redeemed from. Davidson had Common Sense as a client since 2004 and, like others, lamented the fallout from the personal transgressions of one individual. "They're great investors with a great team," he said. Common Sense did not respond to a request for comment. Shorting has also been a brutal game of late. Two of the most high-profile bets against companies—Pershing Square Capital Management's short of Herbalife and Greenlight Capital's move against Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, appear to have lost both firms significant money on paper so far. Some of the most heavily shorted stocks have even outperformed equity indexes this year. They include Tesla Motors, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Netflix and Best Buy. While shorts have been costly, many hedge fund managers have performed well by putting more money in their longs than their shorts. For example, David Einhorn's Greenlight is up 11.8 percent for the year through September and Bill Ackman's Pershing Square is up 8.1 percentthrough October despite its short losses.Performance for the largest short-biased hedge fund firm, Jim Chanos' $6 billion Kynikos Associates, was unavailable. The firm didn't respond to requests for comment. Another firm that has done well is Kerrisdale Capital Management. Sahm Adrangi started the firm in July 2009 with less than $1 million and made his name shorting Chinese companies like China Education Alliance and Advanced Battery Technologies. The firm now manages approximately $300 million and is up about 20 percent this year through mid-November, according to an investor. The fund has been an average of 80 percent net long this year, according to Adrangi. "I think shorting is a difficult way to make money over the long run. It can be done but it's a tougher way to generate wealth over the long term in most markets, especially over the last four years," Adrangi said.Despite the struggles, short-focused managers couldn't be more excited about the opportunity. "The quantity and quality of short signals, especially in large caps, have not been this robust since late '06 or early '07—the period that preceded the last recession," said Kliber of Gracian, which focuses on large companies to avoid the high cost of borrowing associated with many shorts. "The evidence of revenue strain and earnings risk among large companies is not fully reflected in consensus estimates." Another is Davidson of $50 million SC Management. "Since the 2009 lows, we're in (Fed Chairman Ben) Bernanke's grand experiment of QE, which hasn't created the job or wage growth desired. Financial assets have benefited, but now it's time for investor caution," said Davidson. His fund is down 25 percent this year but gained 55 percent net of fees from 2000 to 2012, including a return of 59 percent in 2008. Fichthorn of Dialectic echoed those themes. "You don't see these price to sales multiples on unprofitable businesses ever in history," he said. "It's a bubble—regardless of what the (Fed Open Market Committee) says. After all, they missed and/or caused the last three bubbles." "Everything would give you the indication that shorts are being forced out of the market just as we're going through the second Internet bubble," Fichthorn added. "Social media, three-dimensional printers, service software businesses, Chinese Internet companies, you name it—the valuations are completely unsustainable and disconnected with reality, which presents an amazing opportunity for the patient short seller." At least one manager is launching a new short-focused hedge fund. Bill Fleckenstein shut a short-biased fund in 2009 because he believed the shorting opportunity was over, but now plans to launch a fund in early 2014 with Wesley Golby, formerly a portfolio manager at S Squared Technology. "Once the markets begin to react to consequences of all this money printing, then it will be like shooting fish in a barrel from the short side," Fleckenstein said. Fleckenstein said companies in sectors like three-dimensional printers and social media are drastically overvalued. He believes that a good indicator for the beginning of a market correction will be when 10-year U.S.Treasury note yields rise to 3 percent from their current level of about 2.69 percent.It's not clear what investors think. Some say alternative investors are still bullish. "The current mood among professional investors remains decidedly risk-on," said Daniel Celeghin, a management consultant on alternative investing with Casey Quirk. "Dedicated equity short-selling strategies have not been too popular, as most investors prefer to pay a premium fee for managers who make the timing call for them, and not for a fairly static market exposure." That irks short sellers. "It's shocking to me that long-term investors aren't taking a long-term view of their books," said Fichthorn. "No one is positioned for a down market. You can see it in exposures."One indicator of that risk-on mindset is the recent launch of various long-only private funds from Tiger Global and Coatue Management, for example. Others think investors are finally warming to short sellers. For example, data tracker eVestment has slightly more money flowing to short-biased hedge funds in recent months, a reversal from outflows for the rest of the year. "Anyone with a brain I think can tell that there's a tremendous opportunity setting up on the short side," Fleckenstein said. "Exactly when that's going to happen and will you be able to capture it well are different issues. But there's just no doubt about it. If you think that all this is all going to end well and there isn't going to be a spectacular collapse at some point in the coming year, plus or minus, then you really are naïve." Dialectic—which manages almost $600 million overall with about half in a short strategy—was up 37.9 percent in 2008 and 21.36 percent in 2011 but fell 26.29 percent in 2012 and is down 21.13 percent this year through October, according to a person familiar with the fund. Dialectic declined to comment on its returns.As the equity markets continue to hit record levels, time will tell if the shorts are right and if investors believe them. "Short selling as a strategy is like an umbrella," Gracian's Kliber said. "People don't think they need one until it starts to rain and they get wet." 
REUTERS/Sonali Paul Deere shares are up 3.7% this morning after the farming equipment giant reported better-than-expected earnings and revenues in line with expectations for their fiscal Q4. As usual, they've published a presentation that provides a snapshot of the global agricultural sector.  With a couple of exceptions, it's looking pretty weak — Deere projects global sales will decline by 6% next year as commodity prices decline, which will in turn hit farm income and dampen demand for equipment. Remember, however, that farming looks at the economy a bit differently than consumers. If prices are falling because there's too much supply, as Deere is projecting in several parts of the world, that means lower prices for end users.   Anyway, we've pulled the most important slides. 
REUTERS/Kai PfaffenbachBloomberg News is reporting that the European Central Bank may take the deposit rate into negative territory (from its current 0.0% level) if more monetary easing is needed in the eurozone, and the euro is plunging. Right now, the euro is trading around 1.3480 against the dollar versus levels around 1.3540 prior to the report crossing the wires (down 0.4% on the day). Bloomberg News correspondents Jana Randow and Jeff Black have the scoop: The European Central Bank isÂ considering a smaller-than-normal cut in the deposit rate ifÂ officials decide to take it negative for the first time,Â according to two people with knowledge of the debate. Policy makers would reduce the rate for commercial lendersÂ who park excess cash at the ECB to minus 0.1 percent from zero,Â said the people who declined to be identified because the talksÂ arenâ€™t public. It would be the first time the central bank hasÂ adjusted interest rates by less than a quarter of a percentageÂ point. The concept, which has been discussed by GoverningÂ Council members, doesnâ€™t yet have a consensus, the people said. The upshot, according to Randow and Black: "Policy makers hope that the measure, obliging banks to payÂ to hold a liquidity cushion, would prompt them to lend cash toÂ companies and households instead, the people said. At the sameÂ time, a negative deposit rate also risks curbing banksâ€™ profitÂ as loan rates fall while the institutions may be unable to passÂ negative rates onto depositors." ECB president Mario Draghi said at the ECB's November policy meeting that the central bank was "technically ready" to take the deposit rate negative.

REUTERS/Jessica RinaldiExisting home sales fell 3.2% month-over-month in October to an annualized pace of 5.12 million units.  This was worse than expectations for a 2.9% month-over-month to an annualized pace of 5.14 million units. This was the second straight monthly decline.  September's number was left unchanged to show a 1.9% MoM fall to 5.29 million units the previous month. "The erosion in buying power is dampening home sales," Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist said in a press release. "Moreover, low inventory is holding back sales while at the same time pushing up home prices in most of the country. More new home construction is needed to help relieve the inventory pressure and moderate price gains." The national median existing-home price was up 12.8% on the year to $199,500. Meanwhile, the median time for homes on the market was 54 days, up from 50 days the previous month.  Housing inventory fell 1.8% to 2.13 million units for sale at the end of the month. This represented a 5 month supply at current sales pace. The share of distressed sales in existing home sales was unchanged at 14% in October. This is up from 12% in August, but is well down from 27% in 2012, which is an encouraging sign for the market. Here's a look at the regional breakdown:Â  Pending home sales, considered a leading indicator for future existing home sales, have been falling sharply. This suggests that existing home sales will be ticking lower. Existing home sales account for a larger share of the market than new homes.
APEvan Spiegel, Snapchat boss.Last week, news broke that a ~2.5 year old company called Snapchat had rejected an all-cash $3 billion takeover offer from Facebook. Predictably, the cat-calls and howls of indignation began. Snapchat and its investors were obviously delusional idiots, Twitter pundits agreed. And arrogant! How else could they pass on a crazy offer from a "desperate" Facebook? Snapchat doesn't even haveÂ revenue. Even aÂ one billion dollar offer for a company like that was "insane," let alone a three billion-dollar offer. If anyone needed confirmation that we're right back in a "tech bubble," this was it. Well, as we pointed out last week, this insta-consensus around startling valuations is nothing new in the tech world. People said exactly the same thing when the revenue-less Facebook was first valued at tens of millions of dollars. Then they said it again when the still revenue-less Facebook was valued at hundreds of millions. And then billions. And then tens of billions. And they said the same thing when Twitter was first valued at tens of millions... And Pinterest. And Google. And Amazon. And, basically, every other successful Internet company that has burst on to the scene and grown rapidly over the past 20 years. Because, despite the phenomenal success of these companies â€” and their demonstrated ability to attract users first and build a business later â€” some observers can't seem to fathom that this is a proven way for amazingly successful and valuable companies to be built. But it is. So instead of reflexively howling about the "obvious stupidity" of any executive or investor who passes up a big offer for a revenue-less company, it makes sense to ask what the insiders might be seeing that outside observers aren't. We were curious about that with respect to Snapchat, especially because $3 billion is indeed a very large amount of money. So we asked a couple of insiders. And now we know. Before we explain, though, let's put that $3 billion in context. Back in the mid-1990s, when I was a Wall Street analyst, I once read a research report by one of the best Wall Street tech analysts of the era, a former basketball star named Bill Gurley, who at that point worked for legendary tech banker Frank Quattrone at DMG Technology Group. Gurley has since gone on to become a legendary venture capitalist at Benchmark. And as fate would have it, he's actually a big investor in Snapchat. In his research report, Gurley was attempting to make sense of the valuation of a small but fast-growing tech company that was trading at a stratospheric multiple of earnings (150X, or something). And in the context of the report, Gurley laid out what I have ever since referred to privately as "Gurley's Law." Gurley's Law is this: At some point, every successful tech company will trade at a normal earnings multiple â€” say, 20X-25X earnings. (Gurley used 30X in the 1990s, but the 1990s were unusual). Importantly, Gurley's Law does not mean that any young tech company that is trading at a multiple higher than 20X-25X is "overvalued." Tech companies can grow earnings super-fast, so, as an analyst, you have to be careful not to be too conservative in your earnings projections. (See the mistake everyone made with LinkedIn as an example of this.) But if you find yourself thinking that your favorite little tech company will always trade at, say, 100x earnings or 200x earnings, you're probably hallucinating. (With companies that aren't making money, and don't plan to make money for a good long while â€” Amazon, for example â€” you can also use Gurley's Law with revenue multiples.)Â  The point is that, some day, when the company's growth has slowed to the more normal mature rate experienced by, say, Google and Apple, the multiples on the company's stock will also be normal. So when you're trying to think about what valuation is "fair" for your favorite little company, you would do well to remember that. The other technique that Mr. Gurley taught me was to use a company's valuation to "back into" the implied financial performance that the market was expecting from the company at a given price. And that's what we're going to do with Snapchat. Like Twitter, Facebook, and other social networks, Snapchat has no content costs. So let's assume that, eventually, it will have at least a 50% operating profit margin, and a 35% margin after tax. That means that, for every $3 of revenue, Snapchat will likely earn $1. So how many dollars of profit would Snapchat have to generate to justify a $3 billion valuation? Using Gurley's Law, and a reasonable mature earnings multiple of 25X (way lower than Facebook's current multiple, similar to Google's current multiple), we can estimate that Snapchat would have to earn about $120 million of profit to justify a $3 billion valuation. At a 35% profit margin, Snapchat would have to generate about $350 million of revenue to produce that profit. So, for Snapchat's $3 billion valuation to be reasonable, you have to assume that Snapchat will some day generate, say, $500 million of revenue and $200 million of profit (there's a time-value of money and a discount rate that need to be factored into the valuation. For simplicity's sake, we'll just use numbers than are bigger than the actual revenue and profit numbers we need.) Could Snapchat ever generate $500 million of revenue? Business InsiderAlready, more photos are shared on Snapchat than on Facebook.Well, Facebook is currently generating $8 billion of revenue (annualized), LinkedIn is generating $1.2 billion, and Twitter is already generating $600 million. So if Snapchat becomes a major global social platform in the future, it is perfectly reasonable to think that the company can someday generate $500 million of revenue, if not a lot more. But how? What will Snapchat sell to generate that revenue? According to one insider we spoke with, here are Snapchat's basic plans. The company will experiment with these products and then, when it has found the best ones, hit the gas.
In a research note today, Goldman economistÂ Sven JariÂ Stehn takes a deeper look into the supply side effects of lowering the Fed's unemployment threshold. The Fed has said that it will not raise rates until unemployment hits 6.5% or inflation rises to 2.5% (the Evan's rule). Two weeks ago, the Fed economists released two studies about the effects of lowering that unemployment threshold to 6.0%. In the wake of those papers, Goldman's top economist, Jan Hatzius, predicted that the Fed will do just that along with tapering in March. In today's note, Stehn examines the supply-side effects of lowering the unemployment threshold. Here are the findings:Goldman Sachs In each of the four graphs, the three curves show the current 6.5%/2.5% threshold, a lower 6.0% unemployment threshold and a new curve that represents the Fed using the total employment gap rule. The total employment gap is made up of the unemployment gap (current unemployment minus structural) and the participation gap (current participation minus trend) to offer a full understanding of slack in the labor market. This includes supply-side effects. Under this new rule, the Fed would not raise the Federal Funds rate until mid-2016 when unemployment hits around 5.5%, though there is no exact threshold. The rule also allows inflation to rise at a quicker pace than either the 6.5%/2.5% or 6.0%/2.5% thresholds allow.
US ambassador to China says he will step down early next year to rejoin family in SeattleBEIJING (AP) â€” U.S. Ambassador to China Gary Locke, who oversaw the handling of potential crises over the flights to U.S. diplomatic missions by a persecuted legal activist and a high-profile police chief, said Wednesday he will step down early next year. Locke, the first Chinese-American to hold the post, said he informed President Barack Obama earlier this month of his decision to rejoin his family in Seattle. Locke, 63, known for his affable, non-confrontational style, placed a high priority on improving embassy efficiency and facilitating bilateral trade at a time when exchanges are growing rapidly. Yet his time as ambassador witnessed two of the most delicate diplomatic episodes between the countries in years that had the potential to severely complicate relations. In February 2012, Wang Lijun, the police chief in the western city of Chongqing, fled to a U.S. consulate in southwest China with information about the murder of a British businessman, setting off China's biggest political scandal in years. Wang's intentions were unclear and he was taken into Chinese custody the next day after leaving the consulate on his own. Yet his flight led to the removal and subsequent sentencing to life imprisonment for corruption of Chongqing's leader, Bo Xilai, formerly one of China's most powerful politicians. Just two months later, and days before then-U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton visited Beijing, blind legal activist Chen Guangcheng escaped house arrest and was given shelter in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, where he remained for six days. Locke spent hours each day with Chen and was photographed holding his hand as they entered a hospital, earning plaudits from the overseas human rights lobby. Chinese officials later allowed the activist and his family to leave the country to study in New York. Locke, who is married with three children, took up the post in August 2011 after serving as U.S. commerce secretary and two terms as governor of Washington State. In a statement, Locke listed increased U.S. exports to China, the promotion of Chinese investment in the U.S., and a reduction in waiting times for visas as major accomplishments of his time in office. The speeding up of visa issuance to just three to five days from the previous 70-100 days "significantly increased" Chinese business and tourism to the U.S., he said. During his tenure, embassy officials "advanced American values" by meeting with religious leaders and human rights lawyers and visiting Tibetan and Uighur ethnic minorities in Tibet and Xinjiang, Locke said. Shi Yinhong, an expert on China-U.S. relations at Renmin University, said Locke kept relations steady despite tensions over China's South China Sea territorial claims, its fraught relations with Japan, its increased military capability and its support for Syria's embattled government. "He actually seldom, if ever, openly attacked China over those issues," Shi said. "He took a very cautious attitude. I think that was the right attitude to take, because otherwise he'd be adding fuel to the fire." Locke created a buzz among ordinary Chinese even before he arrived in Beijing via a widely circulated photo of him wearing a backpack and trying to use a coupon to buy coffee at Seattle's airport. Many Chinese Internet users pointed out the contrast with Chinese bureaucrats, who routinely have aides carry their bags and attend to minor tasks. This modest style irked the Chinese leadership. There was no hint of that on Wednesday, though, when a Foreign Ministry spokesman was asked what China thought of him. "Mr. Gary Locke has made active efforts in fostering China-U.S. communication and cooperation," Hong Lei said. "We would like to pay tribute to him." ___ Associated Press researcher Zhao Liang contributed to this report. Copyright (2013) Associated Press. All rights reserved.

A strong October retail sales report has definitely set the tone for markets this morning. S&amp;P 500 futures rose into positive territory following the release and are now trading up 0.2% at 1788. Meanwhile, 30-year U.S. Treasury futures are now down 0.3%, and the yield on the 10-year note is 2.74%, up 3 basis points from yesterday's close. The dollar also initially spiked against the euro and the yen on the release of the retail sales report, but those moves are being faded. Also released at 8:30 were October consumer prices, which rose 1.0% year over year â€” in line with expectations, but down from September's 1.2% annual inflation rate. The charts below show the moves. From left to right across the top are S&amp;P 500 futures, the dollar-yen exchange rate, and the euro-dollar exchange rate. From left to right across the bottom are gold futures, 30-year Treasury futures, and WTI crude oil futures. Thinkorswim
ChinaFotoPress/Getty ImagesAdvance October U.S. retail sales data are out. Total sales rose 0.4% in October, better than consensus estimates for a 0.1% advance. September's figure was revised to 0.0% from -0.1%. Excluding autos, sales rose 0.2%, better than the 0.1% consensus estimate. September's number was revised to 0.3% from 0.4%. Excluding both autos and gasoline, sales rose 0.3%, also better than the 0.2% consensus estimate.Â September's number was revised to 0.3% from 0.4%. The retail sales control group number, which feeds into GDP calculations, rose 0.4%, better than the 0.3% consensus estimate.Â September's number was revised to 0.3% from 0.4%. "The stronger retail sales figure was driven by solid performance of furniture (1.0%) and electronics (1.4%) sales during the month," says Gennadiy Goldberg, a strategist at TD Securities. "Clothing sales and eating &amp; drinking also rose 1.4% and 1.0%, respectively. We believe the stronger performance of these categories may have been a factor of consumers using the savings from lower gasoline prices to finance additional purchases or of retailers clearing inventories. If the former is true, with gasoline prices likely to remain contained in the near-term, we may see stronger consumption trends persist over the next few months, helping to lessen the anticipated impact of the government shutdown on Q4 growth expectations."Â   Click here for the full release Â»
REUTERS/Choi Dae-woongThe new consumer price index inflation numbers are out. In October, CPI fell 0.1% from the previous month after rising 0.2% in September. Economists were expecting a 0.0% print. CPI fell to 1.0% year-over-year from September's 1.2% reading, right in line with economists' expectations. CPI excluding food and energy came rose 0.1% in October from a month earlier, and the year-over-year growth rate was unchanged from September at 1.7%, also in line with consensus estimates.
Scott Olson/Getty ImagesShares of JCPenney are headed higher in pre-market trading following the release of Q3 earnings results this morning. The embattled retailer reported an adjusted loss of $1.81 per share in Q3, which may not compare with the consensus estimate for a $1.74 loss per share, as it includes a $0.73 loss per share on tax valuation allowance. Revenues came in at $2.78 billion, below the consensus $2.80 billion estimate. Despite a 4.8% drop in same-store sales in Q3, the company believes same-store sales trends will improve in Q4. In October, same-store sales were up 0.9%. Currently, shares are up 7.7%. Below is the full text of the release: Sales Performance Continues to Improve as Company Makes Strides toward a Path to Profitable Growth PLANO, Texas, November 20, 2013 --Â J. C. Penney Company, Inc. (JCP) today announced financial results for its fiscal third quarter ended November 2, 2013. Highlights include: Achieved positive comparable store sales in OctoberÂ  Comparable store sales and gross margin improved sequentially throughout the quarterÂ  Sales on jcp.com increased 24.5% for the quarterÂ  Repaid $200 million from revolving credit facilityÂ  Opened 30 new Sephora inside JCPenney locations, bringing total to 446Â  Myron E. (Mike) Ullman, III, Chief Executive Officer of JCPenney, said, "Our strategies to reconnect with customers are beginning to take hold, and this became increasingly clear as the quarter progressed. This is the result of the tremendous efforts of the associates across our Company to restore the merchandise customers want and deliver an unmatched shopping experience. Â We are proud of the Company`s October sales performance, encouraged by the early weeks of November, and believe we are making strides toward a path to long-term profitable growth." Financial Results For the third quarter, JCPenney reported net sales of $2.78 billion compared to $2.93 billion in the fiscal third quarter of 2012. Comparable store sales declined 4.8% for the quarter, which represented a sequential improvement of 710 basis points when compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2013. The quarter ended with a positive 0.9% comparable store sales gain in October. In addition, sales results improved sequentially each month within the quarter. Online sales through jcp.com were $266 million for the quarter, up 24.5% versus the same period last year and reflecting sequential increases through the quarter. Women`s apparel, men`s apparel and fine jewelry were the Company`s top performing merchandise divisions. For the third quarter, gross margin was 29.5% of sales, compared to 32.5% in the same quarter last year. Â Gross margin for the third quarter was negatively impacted by lower clearance margins due to the overhang of inventory from the first two quarters of the year, higher levels of clearance units sold, as well as the Company`s transition back to a promotional pricing strategy as compared to last year`s strategy.Â  Notwithstanding, gross margin did improve sequentially throughout the quarter. SG&amp;A expenses for the quarter were approximately $1 billion, down 1.9% from the previous quarter and down 7.5% from the third quarter of 2012. Operating loss for the fiscal third quarter of 2013 was $401 million. Â The Company incurred $46 million in restructuring and management transition charges, as follows: Home office and stores: ($6) million;Â  Store fixtures: $10 million; Â  Management transition: $3 million; andÂ  Other: $39 million, including $36 million relating to the return of shares of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia previously acquired by the Company.Â  In the third quarter, the Company`s recognized tax benefit was $11 million reflecting a significant reduction in tax benefits typically recognized from federal and state loss carry-forwards due to the recognition of a tax valuation allowance of $184 million during the quarter. This resulted in an effective tax rate of only 2.2% for the third quarter compared to 41.7% in the third quarter of 2012 and negatively impacted earnings per share by $0.73. For the third quarter, the Company incurred a net loss in the amount of $489 million or $1.94 per share. Â This reflects: ($0.73) of loss associated with the tax valuation allowance;Â  ($0.18) of restructuring and management transition charges;Â  ($0.04) for primary pension plan expense; andÂ  $0.09 of benefit on the net gain on the sale of a non-operating asset.Â  Adjusted net loss for the quarter was $457 million, or $1.81 per share, excluding the restructuring and management transition charges, primary pension plan expense, and net gain on the sale of a non-operating asset. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures is included in the schedules accompanying the consolidated financial statements in this release. The adjusted net loss of $1.81 per share includes the $0.73 of loss associated with the tax valuation allowance. Cash Flow and Financial Condition Operating cash flow was a use of $737 million, reflecting net operating losses and an increase of $592 million in inventory, which includes our typical seasonal build in inventory in preparation for the holiday season. Financing cash flow was a source of $557 million, reflecting the net proceeds from the Company`s equity offering of $786 million.Â In addition, financing cash flow included a voluntary repayment of $200 million principal amount under the Company`s revolving credit facility. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the third quarter were $1.227 billion. The Company`s total available liquidity, which includes cash and cash equivalents as well as the availability under the Company`s revolving credit facility, was $1.71 billion at quarter end. Total debt at the end of the quarter was $5.612 billion, including $650 million outstanding on the Company`s revolving credit facility. In the third quarter, the Company paid $161 million in capital expenditures. Accrued and unpaid expenditures were $102 million at the end of the quarter. Mr. Ullman continued, "The spirit and determination of our associates has enabled us to maintain our momentum going into the fourth quarter. We are committed to building on our progress by winning this holiday season. Â The continued strong support of our domestic and international suppliers has helped ensure our merchandise assortment is outstanding. Furthermore, our new marketing campaign, which launched this week, will help remind customers that JCPenney is the destination for great holiday gifts that fit their budget."

REUTERS/Jonathan ErnstGood morning! Here's what you need to know.
WikipediaAircraft maintenance workers in India found 24 gold bars worth $1.2 million stashed aboard a commercial jet, NBC News contributor Alexander Smith of reports. Two bags  stash were found  in a compartment in the bathroom on a  Jet Airways Boeing 737 that had traveled from Mumbai to the Thai capital Bangkok before returning to Kolkata. Airport director BP Sharma told NBC News that the 53 pounds of gold appeared to have originated in the United Arab Emirates. India is the world's largest consumer of gold and smuggling has become rampant. In October four men were arrested for stashing 70 lbs of gold biscuits in the lavatory of an Air India flight. Smith notes: "Much of India's vast gold consumption is hoarded or offered to the gods."
Twitter/Slade SohmerWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Up to 40 percent of the technology needed to run the new Obamacare health insurance marketplace has not yet been built and will not be ready when insurance companies start sending in bills when coverage begins January 1, the project manager of HealthCare.gov told the U.S. Congress on Tuesday. The missing "back-end" technology may not be ready until mid-January, Henry Chao, deputy chief information officer for Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, told a House of Representatives oversight subcommittee. If the business functions are not in place on time, it could create havoc with a system through which billions of dollars in federal tax money will flow to subsidize coverage for consumers who otherwise could not afford it, insurance industry officials said. The first payments are due in mid- to late January. The disclosure added to an atmosphere of uncertainty that has engulfed President Barack Obama's signature domestic policy achievement since HealthCare.gov crashed soon after its October 1 launch. The absence of the back-end technology behind health care marketplaces that have sprung up in all 50 states and the District of Columbia does not prevent consumers from enrolling for coverage through market portals such as HealthCare.gov. Administration officials said the technology was set aside in the run-up to Obamacare's October 1 rollout, so that CMS could concentrate on the consumer features of the troubled federal website, HealthCare.gov. Obama's Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act requires most Americans to be at least enrolled in health coverage by March 31 or pay a penalty. CMS spokeswoman Julie Bataille told reporters that technology for those functions would not be needed until January. "The back-end financial management systems are something that we do not believe are essential until 2014 and we'll roll those out in those timeframes," Bataille said on a conference call with reporters. But a program needed to confirm the identities, subsidy levels and coverage choices of individual plan enrollees would have to be in place in December, if coverage is to begin on time on January 1, said an insurance industry official who asked not to be named. A CMS official warned as early as July that the financial management project was short staffed, weeks behind schedule and the target of a bureaucratic tug-of-war over resources and priorities, according to internal CMS emails. "The upshot is that the (financial management) build appears to be way off track and getting worse," said a July 8 email from Jeffrey Grant of the CMS unit, Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight. The document, provided by Republican investigators in Congress, said staff had been transferred to other projects leaving only one highly skilled developer.

REUTERS/Issei KatoIt's kind of quiet on the economic data front, but last night Japanese trade data came out, and it showed that the trade deficit was much bigger than expected. The weakening yen cuts both ways when it comes to trade. On the one hand, companies that sell in foreign lands benefit from selling in foreign currencies and converting back into a weak currency. But the flipside of that is that parts (and raw materials) are much more expensive when they have to be sourced from abroad. So if your conception of Abenomics â€” Japan's big economic experiment which has seen a weakened yen as part of aggressive monetary policy â€” is that it's just about making exports more competitive, you're totally wrong. It's not a beggar thy number/currency war move. If Abenomics is to work â€” and there are signs that it is â€” it works by stoking inflation expectations so that people domestically spend rather than horde cash. Japan has famously seen years of deflation, which encourages savings and discourages investment. So don't get real hung up on the trade numbers, and make a conclusion about Abenomics. That's not the game. The game is about domestic demand.

AP(Reuters) - President Barack Obama's HealthCare.gov site is riddled with security flaws that put user data of millions of people at risk and it should be shut down until fixed, several technology experts warned lawmakers on Tuesday. The testimony at a congressional hearing could increase concerns among many Americans about Obama's healthcare overhaul, popularly known as Obamacare. Opinion polls show the botched rollout of the online marketplace for health insurance policies has hurt the popularity of the effort. The website collects personal data such as names, birth dates, social security numbers, email addresses and other information that criminals could use for a variety of scams. In a rapid "yes" or "no" question-and-answer session during a Republican-sponsored hearing by the House of Representatives Science, Space and Technology Committee, Republican Representative Chris Collins of New York asked four experts about the security of the site: "Do any of you think today that the site is secure?" The answer from the experts, which included two academics and two private sector technical researchers, was a unanimous "no." "Would you recommend today that this site be shut down until it is?" asked Collins, whose party is opposed to Obamacare and has sought to capitalize on the failures of the website since it opened for enrollment on October 1. Three of the experts said "yes," while a fourth said he did not have enough information to make the call. "The privacy and security of consumers' personal information are a top priority," White House spokesman Jay Carney said after the hearing. "When consumers fill out their online marketplace applications they can trust that the information that they are providing is protected by stringent security standards." HealthCare.gov allows consumers to shop for insurance plans under Obama's Affordable Care Act, which passed in 2010 and mandated that Americans have health insurance. It also created new marketplaces to buy and sell policies. The portal has been bedeviled by technical glitches and reports of security bugs, although officials say they are making progress with repairs and that it should be accessible to the "vast majority" of consumers by November 30. "The Obama administration has a responsibility to ensure that the personal and financial data collected by the government is secure," said Representative Lamar Smith, the Texas Republican who chairs the House science panel. "Unfortunately, in their haste to launch the HealthCare.gov website, it appears the administration cut corners that leaves the site open to hackers and other online criminals," he said. The experts said the site needed to be completely rebuilt to run more efficiently, making it easier to protect. They said HealthCare.gov runs on 500 million lines of code, or 25 times the size of Facebook, one of the world's busiest sites. "When your code base is that large it's going to be indefensible," Morgan Wright, CEO of a firm known as Crowd Sourced Investigations, said in an interview after testifying at the hearing. "Do you want to defend the Great Wall of China or a very small line?" David Kennedy, head of computer security consulting firm TrustedSec LLC and a former U.S. Marine Corpscyber-intelligence analyst, gave lawmakers a 17-page report that highlights the problems with the site and warned that some of them remain live. The site lets people know invalid user names when logging in, allowing hackers to identify user IDs, according to the report, which also warns of other security bugs. Avi Rubin, director of the Information Security Institute at Johns Hopkins University and an expert on health and medical security, said he needed more data before calling for a shutdown of the site. "Bringing down the site is a very drastic response," he told Reuters after the hearing. But he would not use it because he is concerned about security bugs that have been made public, he said. In written testimony, Kennedy said it would take a minimum of seven to 12 months to fix the problems with the site shut down, given the site's complexity and size. In October, a September 27 government memorandum surfaced in which two Department of Health and Human Services officials said the security of the site had not been properly tested before it opened, creating "a high risk." HHS spokeswoman Joanne Peters said then that steps were taken to ease security concerns after the memo was written, and that consumer data was secure. Peters said on Tuesday the government has been making improvements to the site as it has learned of specific problems. In late October technicians fixed a security bug in the password reset function, she said.

Way back in 2005, I posted a graph ofÂ the Real Estate Agent Boom. Here is another update to the long term graph of the number of real estate licensees in California through August 2013.The number of agents peaked at the end of 2007 (housing activity peaked in 2005, and prices in 2006).Â The number of salesperson's licenses is off 32.4% from the peak, andÂ is down 3.3% year-over-year.Â  However, in August, licensees increasedÂ slightlyÂ month-to-monthÂ for the first timeÂ since early 2007.Brokers' licenses are only off 8.4%Â from the peak,Â but are still slowly declining (down 1.1% year-over-year, and down slightly month-to-month). This might be the bottom (or near the bottom) for real estate licensees in California, but so far there is no sign of a new bubble in real estate agents!Â  Calculated Risk
TOKYO (AP) — Japan's trade deficit nearly doubled in October, as growth in imports outpaced robust increases in exports to the U.S. and China, the Finance Ministry reported Wednesday. A weakening in the Japanese yen over the past year has helped exports, but it has also increased the cost in yen terms for imports, especially of oil and natural gas to help offset the loss of generation capacity from nuclear plants idled after meltdowns in 2011 at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear power plant. A 68 percent increase in costs for imported crude oil in October helped push the trade deficit up 96 percent over a year earlier to 1.09 trillion yen ($10.9 billion), the preliminary customs data showed. Imports surged 26 percent year-on-year to 7.2 trillion yen ($72 billion), while exports climbed nearly 19 percent to 6.1 trillion yen ($61 billion). It was the 16th straight month of deficits, which also reflect lackluster demand for exports thanks to a slowdown in growth in China and other developing economies. In yen terms, Japan's vehicle exports jumped 24 percent over a year earlier. Exports of chemicals, machinery and electronics also rose at a double-digit pace. But the offshoring of much of Japan's manufacturing is increasing the costs for industrial components such as semiconductors and optical lenses, further eroding net export growth. Imports of electronics rose 28 percent. Trade trends over the past year illustrate the challenges Prime Minister Shinzo Abe faces as he seeks to reinvigorate the economy with a combination of lavish spending, monetary easing and economic reforms that so far have yet to materialize but are meant to sustain growth in the longer run by improving Japan's waning competitiveness. The weaker yen has fattened the bottom lines, especially in yen terms, of many major companies who earn a large share of their profits overseas. But it also has raised costs for energy and for many other imports of both industrial and consumer goods. Abe has vowed to restore Japan's "monozukuri" manufacturing sector, to help restore the country's economic power and retain relatively well-paying jobs that have supported strong consumer demand in the past. But Japanese corporations continue to move operations overseas, seeking lower costs and proximity to faster growing markets. "The shrinking of manufacturing industries is inevitable because of the growth in the newly industrialized countries," Yukio Noguchi, an adviser to the Institute of Financial Studies at Tokyo's Waseda University. "The Abe government tries to prevent the shrinking of the manufacturing industry, but this is mistaken because this cannot be done," Noguchi said. The United States remained Japan's biggest export market, with shipments rising 26 percent from the year before to 1.16 trillion yen ($11.6 billion), while exports to China climbed 21 percent to 1.15 trillion yen ($11.5 billion).

YouTubeCiti's FX analyst Steven Englander provides the most detailed, forensic, Kremlinology of Ben Bernanke's speech last night to figure out what it means for the debate out when the Fed will scale back asset purchases. Englander writes: The comments by Yellen and Bernanke have to be seen in the context of the key phrase in the last FOMC statement: “In judging when to moderate the pace of asset purchases, the Committee will, at its coming meetings, assess whether incoming information continues to support the Committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective.” The word ‘ongoing’ seemed closer to ‘maintaining’ rather than ‘accelerating’ and that was viewed as somewhat hawkish relative to expectations. Now consider Fed Chairman Bernanke’s speech this evening. The key phrase “When, ultimately, asset purchases do slow, it will likely be because the economy has progressed sufficiently for the Committee to rely more heavily on its rate policies,” is marked as dovish below because it seems to imply that there is a high bar to the beginning of tapering.  Moreover, ‘ultimately’ does not sound like soon, so Bernanke may be trying to echo Yellen for the sake of unity, or it may signal that the beginning of tapering is pushed into the distance. However he does seem to be making a strong case that the Fed’s issue with financial markets was more the market’s advancing of rate hikes, rather than the backing up of rates: “In particular, it appeared that the FOMC's forward guidance for the federal funds rate had become less effective after June, with market participants pulling forward the time at which they expected the Committee to start raising rates, in a manner inconsistent with the guidance.” So it sounds as if they are drawing a distinction between a backing up of long-term yields which is ok, and a pushing forward of FOMC hikes which certainly was occurring in August and early September but which is certainly not the case now.
This is a cool chart from Morgan Stanley.  It shows why the world's biggest markets have rallied this year. In the case of US and European stock markets, it's largely about higher PEs, whereas in Japan it's largely about higher underlying earnings. Emerging markets, obviously, have seen declines on both the PE and EPS front. Morgan Stanley
I know I am a few days late commenting on the latest from Jeremy Grantham, but this note really is a must read.  Grantham is really on point here.  I’ve added a few of the highlights in case you don’t feel like reading the entire thing (you can read the entire note here). Grantham doesn’t yet think there’s a bubble in equities: “In equities there are few signs yet of a traditional bubble. In the U.S. individuals are not yet consistent buyers of mutual funds. Over lunch I am still looking at Patriots’ highlights and not the CNBC talking heads recommending Pumatech or whatever they were in 1999. There are no wonderful and in<U+FB02>uential theories as to why the P/E structure should be much higher today as there were in Japan in 1989 or in the U.S. in 2000, with Greenspan’s theory of the internet driving away the dark clouds of ignorance and ushering in an era of permanently higher P/Es.” He really hates EMH and Stocks for the Long Run: “The folly of Rational Expectations resulted in <U+FB01>ve, six, or seven decades of economic mainstream work being largely thrown away. It did leave us, though, with perhaps the most laughable of all assumption-based theories, the Ef<U+FB01>cient Market Hypothesis (EMH). … (There is only Jeremy Siegel doing his usual, apparently inexhaustible thing of explaining why the market is actually cheap: in 2000 we tangled over the market’s P/E of 30 to 35, which, with arcane and ingenious adjustments, for him did not portend disaster. This time it is unprecedented margins, usually the most dependably mean reverting of all <U+FB01>nancial series, which are apparently now normal.)” He is very clear that it’s not currently a bubble, but says the bubble is coming: “I would think that we are probably in the slow build-up to something interesting – a badly overpriced market and bubble conditions. My personal guess is that the U.S. market, especially the non-blue chips, will work its way higher, perhaps by 20% to 30% in the next year or, more likely, two years, with the rest of the world including emerging market equities covering even more ground in at least a partial catch-up.” And who’s to blame?  Of course, QE and the Fed Chief: “And then we will have the third in the series of serious market busts since 1999 and presumably Greenspan, Bernanke, Yellen, et al. will rest happy, for surely they must expect something like this outcome given their experience. And we the people, of course, will get what we deserve. We acclaimed the original perpetrator of this ill-fated plan – Greenspan – to be the great Maestro, in a general orgy of boot licking. His faithful acolyte, Bernanke, was reappointed by a democratic president and generally lauded for doing (I admit) a perfectly serviceable job of rallying the troops in a crash that absolutely would not have occurred without the dangerous experiments in deregulation and no regulation (of the subprime instruments, for example) of his and his predecessor’s policy.” And when it blows up we’ll all get a chance to praise Janet Yellen for “fixing” it all: “At this rate, one day we will praise Yellen (or a similar successor) for helping out adequately in the wreckage of the next utterly unnecessary <U+FB01>nancial and asset class failure. Deregulation was eventually a disappointment even to Greenspan, shocked at the bad behavior of <U+FB01>nancial leaders who, incomprehensibly to him, were not even attempting to maximize long-term risk-adjusted pro<U+FB01>ts. Indeed, instead of the “price discovery” so central to modern economic theory we had “greed discovery.”” Still, Grantham says the prudent investor should realize that stocks are badly overpriced now: “In the meantime investors should be aware that the U.S. market is already badly overpriced – indeed, we believe it is priced to deliver negative real returns over seven years – and that most foreign markets having moved up rapidly this summer are also overpriced but less so. In our view, prudent investors should already be reducing their equity bets and their risk level in general. One of the more painful lessons in investing is that the prudent investor (or “value investor” if you prefer) almost invariably must forego plenty of fun at the top end of markets. This market is alreadyno exception, but speculation can hurt prudence much more and probably will. Ah, that’s life. And with a Fed like ours it’s probably what we deserve. “ And what are the big risks for the market?  Grantham provides a dose of economic reality and an unhappy historical point: “What can go wrong for the market? There is a slow and for me rather sinister slowing down of economic growth, most obviously in Europe but also globally, that could at worst overwhelm even the Fed. The general lack of <U+FB01>scal stimulus globally and the almost precipitous decline in the U.S. Federal de<U+FB01>cit in particular do not help. What are the odds in the next two years? Perhaps one in four. … Hot off the press, for a less serious moment at our client conference comes the latest update (or data mining, if you prefer) of the… ta da…Presidential Cycle. Since October 1977 when GMO started, 36 years have passed. In that time – when logic and experience say you stimulate to help the next election – the third year has been over 1½ times the other three added together and years one and two, when you should be tightening, have been commensurately weak. For the weakest <U+FB01>ve cycles, the average of years one and two was negative but for three cycles it was strong, even very strong. These three cannot be blamed totally on the Greenspan-Bernanke regime’s tendency to overstimulate, but mostly they can. Bearing in mind that for us Presidential years run October 1-September 30, these three two-year returns were 1996, +48%; 1984, +43%; and 2004, +19%. Now, this is the scary part. 1996 ended in the 2000 crash, 1984 in the crash of 1987, and 2004 in the <U+FB01>nancial crash of 2008. In the current cycle we are already up 19% with a year to run! Of course, it may turn out to be a very strong two years and all will be well. Who knows?” Great thoughts.  Always very thought provoking.  There’s a reason why I think Grantham is a must read….
Tiago Fioreze/Wikimedia CommonsIt's a quiet morning, and markets aren't doing much of anything. US futures are up a tad. Europe is flat. Asia was mixed This entire week has been pretty quiet, and obviously today is no exception. Last night, Bernanke gave a speech on monetary policy that was fascinating, but obviously not majorly market moving.
