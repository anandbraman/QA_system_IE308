REUTERS/Jason ReedThis afternoon, Larry Summers announced he was withdrawing his name for Fed Chair. Now, the Wall Street Journal's Damian Paletta reports Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner, who'd previously expressed reluctance to take the position, is holding firm and will not seek the nomination. That leaves current Vice Chair Janet Yellen and Yellen's immediate predecessor, Don Kohn, as the lone, known candidates. We've profiled both â€” Yellen remains the favorite thanks to her position supporting current policies, and has the backing of 200+ academics. Kohn, a lifelong Fed official, would likely face a smoother confirmation hearing. But Capital Economics' Paul Ashworth says it's likely President Obama will now delay his appointment, and could even search for an as-yet unnamed candidate.
REUTERSPresident Clinton is applauded by members of his White House staff engaged in budget negotiations in the White House Rose Garden (May 16, 1997). UPDATE: The U.S. Senate confirmed Janet Yellen to become the 15th chair of the Federal Reserve on Monday, Dec. 6, 2014. It's looking increasingly likely that Ben Bernanke will no longer be the Chairman of the Federal Reserve at this time next year. In an interview Monday, President Obama said Bernanke hasÂ "already stayed a lot longer than he wanted or he was supposed to." When asked about his intentions regarding plans for the future, Bernanke has not said much, though the Fed chairman has decided to skip this year's Jackson Hole summit of world central bankers in August, where he would normally be responsible for delivering the keynote address. In recent years, the Jackson Hole keynote has been an important stage for signaling big shifts in U.S. monetary policy, a key driver of economic dynamics not only in America, but around the world. This year, the most important signal from the keynote may not be in the contents of the speech, but in who is delivering it in Bernanke's place: Federal Reserve Vice Chairwoman Janet Yellen, who is widely tipped as the frontrunner to replace Bernanke when his term expires in January. If Obama does select Yellen to replace Bernanke, she will become the first woman ever to chair the Federal Reserve, putting her in arguably the most powerful policy-making role in the world. And of course, unless you follow the Fed, you've probably never heard of her. (Global financial markets have reinforced the notion that the Fed chair is all-powerful in recent weeks: as fears that the Fed will begin slowing the pace of its monetary stimulus have seeped into the marketplace, U.S. government debt has sold off dramatically, causing major reverberations in virtually every market around the world. Because U.S. monetary policy is so influential, economist David Beckworth, for example,Â has referred to the Fed as a "monetary superpower.") By every account, Yellen is a thoughtful and brilliant economist, which has allowed her to rise to where she is today. "Ms. Yellen climbed the Fed ranks by being methodical rather than iconoclastic," writes Wall Street Journal reporter Jon Hilsenrath in a recent profile of the Fed vice-chairman. "She shows up at policy meetings with carefully crafted statements. Those who work with her say she arrives at the airport hours early." "[Yellen]Â is very low-key, but impresses people quickly with the depth of her understanding and the sincerity of her views," said fellow Berkeley professor Andrew RoseÂ in 1994, describing her as "collegial, persuasive and effective." She has also worked with the academic elite of the economics sphere her entire career. Her mentor at Yale, where she received her Ph.D. in 1971, was Nobel-Prize winning economist James Tobin, whose legacy is enshrined in today's economics textbooks.Â After graduating from Yale, she taught at Harvard for five years.Â Then, she did a two-year stint (1976-1978) as a staff economist at the Federal Reserve, where she met her husband, fellow economist and future Nobel Prize winner George Akerlof. After the Federal Reserve, Yellen was faculty at the London School of Economics for two years. Then, in 1980, she accepted a position at the University of California, Berkeley, where she stayed until her appointment to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors in 1994 by President Bill Clinton. Months before his April 1994 nomination of Yellen, Clinton had selected one of Yellen's long-time colleagues at Berkeley's Haas School of Business, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, to chair the Council of Economic Advisers (making Tyson his top economist at the White House). According to an L.A. Times report on Clinton's 1994 nomination of Yellen, Tyson was "deeply involved in the selection process for filling the Fed vacancies." The report went on to assert that "Yellen, who would succeed Republican Wayne Angell on the board, also fulfills the Administration's desire to name a woman or a minority to offset the appointment of [Alan] Blinder, a white male, to be Fed vice chairman." (Tyson herself was reportedly tapped by Clinton over then-World Bank economist Larry Summers because Summers and Clinton's vice president, Al Gore, didn't see eye-to-eye on issues related to environmental economics.) So began Yellen's long career in monetary policy-making, which has already been momentous in reshaping the directives that have emanated from the central bank and driven major changes in the global economic landscape. One of the defining moments for Yellen that crystallized both her economic views and her character traits came two years into her tenure on the FOMC. In a recent profile of Yellen, New York Times correspondent Binyamin Appelbaum tells the story: In July 1996, theÂ Federal ReserveÂ broke the metronomic routine of its closed-door policy-making meetings to hold an unusual debate. The Fedâ€™s powerful chairman, Alan Greenspan, saw a chance for the first time in decades to drive annual inflation all the way down to zero, achieving the price stability he had long regarded as the central bankâ€™s primary mission. ButÂ Janet L. Yellen, then a relatively new and little-known Fed governor, talked Mr. Greenspan to a standstill that day, arguing that a little inflation was a good thing. She marshaled academic research that showed it would reduce the depth and frequency of recessions, articulating a view that has prevailed at the Fed. And as the Fedâ€™s vice chairwoman since 2010, Ms. Yellen has played a leading role in cementing the central bankâ€™s commitment to keep prices rising about 2 percent each year. Inflation has become one of the biggest stories in economics recently as annual inflation rates have been declining and seem stuck persistently below the Fed's 2.5% threshold for tightening monetary policy. Today's consumer price index release revealed that core price inflation remained stubbornly unchanged at 1.7% in May. Persistently below-target inflation readings have provided support for the argument that the Fed should continue with its controversial bond-buying program aimed at providing monetary stimulus to the economy. As arguably the most dovish member of the FOMC â€“ meaning she tends to focus on unemployment concerns rather than keeping inflation at bay â€“ Yellen has undoubtedly had a big role in shaping the course of current policy. Yet Yellen's record shows that she has not always argued for easy monetary policy and higher inflation, despite her dovish tilt. Later in 1996, the economy was expanding, labor markets were tight, but core inflation was on a steady downward trend. At the September 1996 FOMC meeting, though, Yellen argued, "IÂ conclude that the risk of an increase in inflation has definitelyÂ risen, and I would characterize the economy as operating in anÂ inflationary danger zone." While Yellen ultimately supported then-Chairman Alan Greenspan's decision to leave interest rates unchanged, she couched her decision by saying, "I find myself very close to the margin andÂ would also have been quite willing to support an upward adjustment ofÂ 25 basis points today, had you proposed that." In 1996, Yellen's argument rested on the thesis that the labor market was too tight. To be sure, things are much different now â€“ the unemployment rate remains stubbornly elevated around current levels at 7.6%, and concerns over inflation appear to be all but dead at this point. And given the Fed's current policy stance â€“ committed to unprecedented monetary easing until signs of improvement in the labor market re-emerge â€“ perhaps it's just as accurate to say that Yellen has already become the most powerful woman in history. Taking over the chairmanship in January would cement it.

Australia's ASX 200 is 0.25% higher. Korea's Kospi is up 1.08%. Japan is closed for a holiday. "Larry Summersâ€™ withdrawal from the race for Fed chair will likely be interpreted by markets as bullish for US interest rate curve trades, duration more generally, and risk assets (including credit and equities)," wrote PIMCO's Mohamed El-Erian for Business Insider. "It may also impact the manner in which the outcome of this weekâ€™s important Fed policy meeting is interpreted by markets." This is is Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) week, so you'll want to keep it here for all your Fed coverage.Â 
REUTERS/Brendan McDermidEveryone is weighing in on Larry Summers' announcement that he is withdrawing his name for Fed chair. The latest is from The New York Times' Paul Krugman, who adds a personal note along with some punditry in a post called "Freedom Is Just Another Word For Nothing Left To Lose." First, he says President Obama must now pick Janet Yellen — in his opinion, she is simply the best candidate: "... it’s really, really hard to see how Obama can justify not picking Janet Yellen at this point. Nobody else is as qualified; any other choice would look like spite." He goes on to say that he feels bad for Larry Summers: "Just a personal reaction: I’ve known Larry for all our adult lives, and looking at this sad play I realize how lucky I am to have reached a place where I’m no longer in the rat race. Obviously I’m plenty combative, and in a way still ambitious too; I do track my Twitter followers, wonder how each column will do on the most-emailed list, and all that. But there are no promotions I’m seeking, no honors I desperately desire that I don’t already have." Very Zen of him.
With Summersâ€™ exit, Janet Yellen regains her well-earned status of front runner. So, absent new news on other candidates, markets will likely interpret this as significantly increasing the probability of broad policy continuity at the Fed. This would be seen as being particularly supportive for the front end of the Treasury curve. Immediate beneficial effects would also be felt by other segments of fixed income and equities. In thinking about the market implications of the Summersâ€™ news (and recognising that it is still premature to completely rule out other candidates), we should also remember that the Fed may well be on the verge this week of a taper in its monthly purchases of market securities. Given the still-tepid nature of economic growth and job creation, Fed officials may also look to reduce the possibility of disruptive market reactions by evolving the forward guidance component of their experimental policy stance. Yellenâ€™s renewed front runner status would be viewed by markets as moderating the expected pace of additional taper, as well as increasing the scope for more aggressive use of forward guidance (the credibility of which would be enhanced, other things being equal, by the higher probability of Yellenâ€™s appointment). This would provide additional support to curve trades and duration more generally. Bottom line: Expect some pretty significant market moves on Monday.
Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers has withdrawn his name from contention to succeed Ben Bernanke as Federal Reserve chairman. Now, lots of people think President Obama will (or, in the case of our Josh Barro, as well as 200+ economists, should) pick current Vice Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen. But Capital Economics' Chief U.S. Economist Paul Ashworth thinks the administration may not end up doing so. In a new note, he writes that the mechanics of getting Yellen through the Senate — as well as the president's own possible preference — does not bode well for her candidacy. The Obama administration has shown little, if any, enthusiasm for Yellen ... so we're not convinced she will necessarily get the nod. Summers candidacy was sunk by the opposition of many Senate Democrats, which would have made it hard, if not impossible, to get his nomination confirmed. Nominating Yellen now could make Obama look weak, kowtowing to the Democrats who have been openly campaigning for her. Instead, it now seems former Fed Vice Chairman Donald Kohn, Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner, or some as-yet-unknown candidate all arguably have an equal shot: Instead, it's possible that there will now be a delay in the nomination process, while the administration seeks a new candidate. We know Obama has already interviewed Ex-Fed Vice Chair Donald Kohn and we wouldn't rule out the administration seeking to change Tim Geithner's mind. All things considered, Yellen is probably now the favourite, but not the near-certainty that many will proclaim her to be. Bernanke steps down in January.
REUTERS/Stefan WermuthLarry SummersEarlier today, we learned that former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers withdrew himself as a candidate for the next chairman of the Federal Reserve. Summers was long considered one of the top two or three candidates to fill the seat that's expected to be vacated in January by current Chairman Ben Bernanke. Summers was considered more hawkish than the favorite, current Fed Vice Chairwoman Janet Yellen. "Stocks should do very well," tweeted PIMCO's Bill Gross. Currently, the dollar is falling, and U.S. stock index futures are exploding higher. Dow futures are up 165 points. S&amp;P 500 futures are up 17.8 points.Â  These numbers suggest that U.S. stocks will open up by around 1% on Monday. On Saturday, President Obama released a statement saying that the U.S. and Russia have "concrete step toward the goal of moving Syria's chemical weapons under international control so that they may ultimately be destroyed." Markets may be encouraged by falling probability of a military strike on Syria. Here's a look at S&amp;P futures via FinViz. FinViz
REUTERS/Jason ReedDonald Kohn, Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, speaks at the Symposium on Interest Rate Risk Management in Arlington January 29, 2010. Larry Summers is out for next Fed Chair. So who will replace Ben Bernanke? Many think the momentum will now swing to current Fed Vice Chair Janet Yellen. But back in July, former Fed Vice Chair Donald Kohn's name was floated alongside Â Yellen's. Yellen remains the favorite, and is also slightly more well known, thanks to her standing among academics. So we wanted to give you the low-down on Kohn. For more on the possible candidates, see here.
REUTERS/Price ChambersFederal Reserve Vice Chairwoman Janet Yellen, who should be the next person to chair the Federal Reserve.Like almost everybody who doesn't actually work at the White House, I didn't want Larry Summers to be the next Federal Reserve Chairman, and this afternoon I've gotten my wish. Well, actually I've only gotten part of my wish. What made a possible Summers pick so objectionable is that Janet Yellen exists. She's already the vice chairwoman of the Fed. She's a key architect and proponent of the Fed's appropriately accommodative monetary policies. Her selection would reassure financial markets that easing would continue as appropriate. And she doesn't have Summers' track record of undermining his initiatives by unnecessarily alienating people. To capitalize on all those upsides, the president now has to actually pick Yellen. Other possible picks, like former Fed Vice Chairmen Donald Kohn and Roger Ferguson, are qualified but would add unnecessary uncertainty about the direction of monetary policy. Berkeley Prof. Brad DeLong, a frequent Summers collaborator who was one of his few high-profile boosters from outside the administration, was critical of Summers opponents on the grounds that they might be creating a monster. DeLong likes both Summers and Yellen. But with Summers out, DeLong figured the president was likely to pick not Yellen but someone like Kohn or Ferguson, and therefore get a monetary policy worse than he would expect from either Summers or Yellen. I am more hopeful. At first, I interpreted the White House's prolonged Summers flirtation as a signal that the president had a problem with Yellen. But the flurry of anonymous quotes over the last month from senior officials and former senior officials suggested that the president is simply enamored of Summers and his crisis-management abilities. If the Summers gambit was about desperately wanting Summers, it doesn't have to have been about desperately trying to avoid Yellen. In fact, Yellen is now the only widely discussed candidate for Fed Chair whom Barack Obama has already appointed to a senior position: He made her the Fed Vice-Chairwoman just three years ago. (That trumps Ferguson's service as a member of the President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness.)Â Yellen was confirmed on a Senate voice vote, her nomination having been passed out of committee by 16-7. So I think we have every reason to believe that President Obama likes Yellen (though not as much as he likes Summers) and that the Senate would confirm her (though some hard-money Republicans would vote no). Plus, unlike with Summers, Obama can count on Democrats to stick up for Yellen against Republican obstruction. Obama should nominate Yellen, and I think it's likely that he will. The last remaining step is for him to do so.
REUTERS/Price ChambersJanet YellenBombshell weekend news: Larry Summers has withdrawn from consideration to be the next Fed Chair, citing a difficult Senate confirmation process. So who could get it? The favorite for sure is Janet Yellen. She's the current Fed vice chairwoman, and a clear continuation of the current regime. She's a brilliant economist, who is supported by the vast majority of academic economists. Over 400 top-names signed a letter on her behalf last week. She's generally regarded as being "dovish" meaning more willing to tolerate inflation risk if it means getting unemployment back to normal, though throughout her career she's been flexible and adaptive. If nominated, she would be the first woman to lead the Federal Reserve. The other possibility that Obama has publicly floated, in addition to Yellen and Summers, is Donald Kohn. He was also a Fed vice chairman (through 2010) and would also likely be seen as a continuation of Bernanke. According to Charlie Gasparino, Kohn has received support from Tim Geithner, who has advised Obama during this process. Speaking of Tim Geithner, Obama apparently wanted him, according to reports. The fact that Obama was so into Larry Summers, despite the opposition, is a strong sign that for the position the president was eager to have a trusted loyalist, and not bring in an outsider around whom he had less familiarity. Geithner fits the bill, but according to reports, he has resisted any overtures, and is happy in the private sector. Still, anything's possible. Another name that was discussed a lot early on was Roger Ferguson. Ferguson is the President and CEO of TIAA-CREF and was the on the Fed from 1997-2006, service as vice chairman before Donald Kohn. As Matt O'Brien at The Atlantic has explained, he is highly qualified and would likely cut a Bernanke-esque policy path. ULTRA WILD CARD: Former Bank of Israel chief Stanley Fischer. This is the monetary policy wonk's dream because he's basically been the professor to everyone these days who matters. Probably no chance it will happen.
SAUL LOEB/AFP via GettyPresident Barack Obama has released a statement on Larry Summers' stunning withdrawal of his name from consideration to be the next chair of the Federal Reserve Board.  Here's the statement: "Earlier today, I spoke with Larry Summers and accepted his decision to withdraw his name from consideration for Chairman of the Federal Reserve. Larry was a critical member of my team as we faced down the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, and it was in no small part because of his expertise, wisdom, and leadership that we wrestled the economy back to growth and made the kind of progress we are seeing today. I will always be grateful to Larry for his tireless work and service on behalf of his country, and I look forward to continuing to seek his guidance and counsel in the future." Summers' withdrawal letter to Obama noted the expectation of an "acrimonious" confirmation process, amid growing opposition from the liberal wing of the Democratic Party.  Four Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee — which must first confirm the Fed Chair nomination before it goes to the full Senate — had already said they opposed Summers' candidacy. Democrats' preferred candidate is Janet Yellen, the current Fed vice chair.
The big news right now is that Larry Summers is withdrawing his name from candidacy for Fed Chair. Summers withdrew from consideration in a letter to President Obama citing the likely acrimonious nature of any Senate nominating process. Of the candidates to replace Bernanke, Summers was seen as the most "hawkish", meaning not inclined to use monetary stimulus to boost the economy. With Summers out, the likely next chief (perhaps Yellen) would be relatively more dovish, and as such the U.S. dollar is weakening on the news. Here's the dollar vs. the yen. XE.com

ShutterstockWhat do hedge funds do, and how do they make money? These are questions everyone wants answers to. And most people would like those answers to not be too technical. Reddit user gadela08 who claims to be a hedge fund insider provides a brief, crystal clear explanation of how hedge funds operate. 1) On securities research and analysis Here are the Redditor's key points: That last bullet includes testing legal limitations. Here's exactly what the Redditor said (emphasis added): We maintain open contact with over 40 different brokers in various markets. Every day, these guys send me hundreds of emails and text messages over bloomberg telling me as much as they legally can about what kind of flows they're seeing. When they buy a large block of securities from a client, they let me know what they just bought and offer me a structured trade for those products so they clear the risk off their books. sometimes they call me to tell me interesting or urgent news about a particular trade that i currently have on that I may have missed in the news that morning. This gives you a sense of how the big players can have an edge over mom-and-pop. 2) On the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) The EMH more or less argues that the all available information is already priced into the market. And therefore, it is basically impossible to beat the market. However, many dispute this theory and believe it's a mistake to take it too seriously. Another Redditor identified six ways a trader could theoretically take advantage of inefficiencies. We paraphrase here. Again, all this just goes to show that mom-and-pop are likely to have a disadvantage relative to the big players. Read the whole thread at Reddit.
REUTERS/ Robert GalbraithJanet Yellen, vice chair of the Board of Governors of the U.S. Federal Reserve SystemIn the middle of the night this past Friday, the price of gold quickly dropped on a report in the Japanese business newspaper Nikkei that the White House had decided to appoint Larry Summers as the next Fed chair and that the announcement would likely be made next week. The White House later denied the report, but the implication of the market's reaction is clear: Larry Summers is viewed as the "hawkish," tight-money alternative to Janet Yellen, and as such, that should mean a strong dollar and weak gold. But this hawkish vs. dovish dichotomy is not really that useful. At least in the current context, neither is expected to have a meaningful impact on the future of Quantitative Easing (the wind-down process of which is likely to begin before either would take the top job) and both would likely extend zero interest rates for a long time. So what makes Yellen the superior choice? In a post in July, Cardiff Garcia made the case for Janet Yellen, and included one sentence which has really stayed with us: Not that Yellen can predict the twists and turns of the economy with perfect clarity â€” nobody can â€” but rather she has consistently shown a deep early understanding of the underlying pressures building in the economy and the scale of their potential consequences. This is true. In the late '90s, Janet Yellen was worried about the economy overheating. This was thoroughly discussed in Lawrence Meyer's book, "A Term At The Fed." In the mid-2000s, Yellen was worried about the housing bubble, and the impact of a bust. Post-crisis, Yellen has recognized that inflation is the least of our problems, and that everything the Fed does should be oriented towards addressing the unemployment problem. (Hence the "dovish" reputation.) This shows a flexibility of thought and an ability to recognize what the key issues of the moment are that would make her a prime Fed chair. Yes, Yellen seems to believe in the power of monetary policy to address the current malaise a bit more than Summers does, so that's one reason to call her dovish. But Yellen's excellent understanding of "underlying pressures building in the economy" is what makes her stand out.

Most market economists expect the Federal Reserve to finally announce the tapering of its monthly purchases of $85 billion worth of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed bonds this Wednesday at 2:00 p.m. ET, the conclusion of its two-day Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. These large-scale asset purchases, also referred to as quantitative easing (QE), have been intended to keep interest rates low to stimulate the economy. However, not every economist has a September taper announcement is their base-case scenario. "We see a very close call, with a higher probability of tapering later this year (our base case is December) than at the September meeting," said Bank of America Merrill Lynch's Michael Hanson. "While we expect the Fed to taper at one of the next three FOMC meetings, we see good reasons to be patient: recent data have, on balance, underperformed; the Fed needs to reduce its over-optimistic forecasts; and downside risks have re-emerged." Indeed, it could appear contradictory if the Fed announced a taper while downgrading its economic outlook. And we'll get explicit details of their outlook at the conclusion of the FOMC meeting. From Hanson: In addition to the statement, an updated Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) will be released at 2 PM ET on Wednesday. We look for 2013 growth forecasts to be revised lower — another factor that makes us skeptical of a quick or large taper. They also may reduce the unemployment rate forecasts for this year or next on the continued drop in participation. We anticipate slightly slower 2016 growth than in 2015 as the output gap narrows, and unemployment and inflation closer to, but not at, their longer-run levels. Participants also will give their projections for the end-2016 fed funds rate target, and markets are likely to pay careful attention to this guidance. Excluding hawkish outliers, we expect a wide spread with an average around 2% to 2.5% — again, a sign of a gradual exit. Should we get a taper announcement on Wednesday, Hanson believes it will be a taper-lite scenario, which is expected by many. "[I]f the FOMC were to decide to reduce their purchase pace in September, we would look for a “token taper” of $10 - 15 bn, in conjunction with dovish language signaling the Fed’s intent to undertake a gradual, data-dependent policy toward ending QE3," said Hanson. "We also see a decent chance that the Fed could taper more in Treasuries than MBS in this first move, although our base case is a balanced reduction." We'll cover the announcement live at BusinessInsider.com.
eBayMichael "Sugar" Ray Richardson was the star of the Knicks during the 1981-82 season.In the early 1980s, the FBI concluded that it “seemed to possess very credible information that three members of the New York Knicks were shaving points as a favor to their cocaine supplier,” according to FBI documents. The documents are published in the new book Larceny Games: Sports Gambling, Game Fixing and the FBI by Brian Tuohy. The FBI has confirmed the authenticity of the documents cited by Tuohy to The New York Post. Ben Golliver of Sports Illustrated reports that, according to the book, an FBI informant told the bureau that “one of the largest [drug] dealers on the East Coast” increased his bets on the Knicks from $300 per game to $10,000 per game during March 1982. Most of those bets were reportedly successful. The informant said that the unnamed dealer was receiving “inside player information not known to the general public,” such as key players sitting out, from unnamed Knicks players during the 1981-82 season. Tuohy writes that Knicks players even began betting against themselves. From the FBI documents (via "Larceny Games"): “Source further stated that at this point, he believes that the players must be betting against the Knicks to lose. … Source observed heavy betting by [redacted] toward the latter part of the NY Knicks season, on the Knicks to lose certain games. In each case, the Knicks did lose, or failed to cover the point spread on the game.” Golliver notes that the 1981-82 Knicks finished with a 33-49 record, losing eight of their final nine games. Tuohy notes that the FBI's investigation continued for years but charges never materialized because of a lack of confessions and physical evidence. The Post caught up with the team’s leading scorer, Micheal "Sugar" Ray Richardson, who was banned for life in 1986 for violating the league’s substance abuse policy after struggling with a cocaine addiction.  When asked about the point-shaving allegations, the four-time NBA All-Star told the Post: “Hell no! We never did anything like that.” Check out the book &gt;
APMaking the case for new infrastructure developments, President Barack Obama on Sunday said that new developments in technology couldn't account fully for the vast need for improvements in the country's roads and bridges. Obama said in an interview on ABC's "This Week" with George Stephanopoulos that the U.S. is grappling to deal with some economic trends that go "beyond Washington" — for example, the use of ATMs in banks and online travel-booking sites that have led to a decline in bank tellers and travel agents. One area that Washington could spur growth, five years after the financial crisis, is through further investment in infrastructure, he said. Here's Obama: So there's a whole bunch of stuff that’s happening in the marketplace. But if we have policies that make sure that our kids are prepared for higher skilled jobs. If we have policies that make sure that we’re rebuilding our infrastructure, because a robot can’t build a road. And we need, you know, new ports and a smarter electricity grid, if we’re making investments, to make sure that research and development continues to happen here. If we have tax breaks for companies that are investing here in the United States as opposed to overseas, all those things can make the situation better. It doesn’t solve the problem entirely, but it pushes against these trends.  And the problem that we’ve got right now is you’ve got a portion of– Congress who– whose policies don’t just– wanna– you know, leave things alone, they actually wanna accelerate these trends. Obama isn't exactly averse to the use of robots and machines across the economy. In 2011, he announced the National Robotics Initiative, a $70 million program that allows for the "development and use of robots" that work alongside and "in close cooperation with" people. It appears that these latest comments were a new plea for investment in infrastructure. Obama's comments on the economy comes before the next few weeks in Washington are expected to be consumed with budget battles. One will come over the bill to keep the government funded and avoid a shutdown, and the other will come over the need to raise the nation's debt ceiling. Obama will deliver remarks in the Rose Garden to mark the five-year anniversary of the financial crisis, the White House said. He's also expected to mention the budget debates.
ShutterstockIt seems like life on Wall Street is better on the buy-side. People who work at hedge funds tend to get a bigger salary and better hours as opposed to investment banking.

With a few exceptions here and there, crises in government funding don't simply arrive on the doorstep unannounced. Their progress toward the eventual Bang! moment is there for all the world to see. What final misdeed triggers the ultimate phase of the crisis is less predictable, but the root cause is almost always the same: debt. And whether that debt is actually borrowed or is merely promised to the populace, when the market becomes worried that the ability of the government to fund its promises is suspect, then the end is near. Last week we began a series on what I think is an impending crisis in the unfunded pension liabilities of state and local governments in the United States. To talk about the situation using the word crisis can seem a little hyperbolic. The problems are distributed throughout the country, yet not every city or state has significant unfunded pension liabilities. And even those that do can muddle through for very long time before a smoldering problem explodes into an actual crisis. Think Detroit. You could see the crisis building for years and years in the media before it finally reached the breaking point. And Detroit was not the first city to go bankrupt, though it has been the largest. But unless significant action is taken to alleviate the problem of debt, we are going to see even larger cities and then whole states enter a crisis period. And as we will see from the data, we are not talking insignificant states. This week we continue our series on the unfunded liabilities of states and cities. Note: this letter will print a little longer than most, as there are lots of charts and graphs. As we discussed in last week's letter on state pensions, official estimates of accrued liabilities understate funding shortfalls by conveniently assuming unrealistic investment returns into perpetuity. While official estimates report state-level unfunded liabilities across all 50 states at only $1 trillion today, the unfunded liability burden jumps to over $4 trillion if we discount those liabilities at more reasonable expected rates of return. John Mauldin In case you were wondering, the $4.1 trillion funding shortfall includes only state-run pensions, meaning that funding gaps at local levels of government are not included. We went to great lengths this past week to calculate the total pension gap at both state and local levels across all fifty states, but we were told the data does not exist â€“ at least not in one place. Many cities and counties invest their funds with state pension plans rather than managing them separately, but the best estimate I could get was that if you included all the separately managed city and county pensions, it might increase the total amount by anywhere from 10 to 20%. Even without another $500 billion to $1 trillion in unfunded pension liabilities, the implications of this gaping hole in the available pension research are truly mind-blowing, considering that, in extreme cases such as we are seeing in Detroit, local unfunded liabilities may become obligations of the states for purely political reasons. So we are stuck looking at the problem from a state-run-pension perspective, knowing that the actual shortfall could be even larger. If anyone knows of better sources for this data, I would really appreciate hearing about them. The Aggregate or the Particular? It may be tempting to look at aggregate pension shortfalls at the national level, but these shortfalls really amount to a state-by-state issue that will ultimately force troubled states to (1) increase taxes, (2) cut public services, and/or (3) reduce retirement benefits for current and already retired public employees.Â Cities and counties like Detroit (or Chicago?) that manage their own pensions and are underfunded will confront the same set of choices. Making matters even more complicated, not all states can legally cut public employee retirement benefits. Illinois, Alaska, Louisiana, Hawaii, Michigan, Arizona, and New York (shown in red below) all have clauses in their state constitutions that protect public employee defined-benefit pension plans. While most states can reduce pensions to address their budget deficits, these seven must first amend their state constitutions. As you can see, several of these states are at the bottom of the pack in terms of funding ratios, but Illinois is the most vulnerable. (Funding ratios use the more conservative model suggested by Moody's and GASB, as we talked about last week.) John Mauldin At only 24% funded, according to Moody's new methodology, Illinois is the single-most underfunded state in the union â€“ the worst of an entire basket of bad apples. This week will focus primarily on Illinois, but we will cast our eye around the country in coming weeks. The state of Illinois's five state-level pensions (TRS, SERS, SURS, JRS, &amp; GARS) report current accrued liabilities at $146 billion, but the state has set aside only $63 billion to cover future benefits. According to these official estimates (which are already a year old), the $83 billion shortfall in unfunded liabilities leaves the stateâ€™s pensions only 43% funded, on average. Unfortunately, the real numbers are far worse. According to Moody's new methodology, which discounts future liabilities using the more reasonable rate of return on high-grade corporate bonds (about 4% today), current accrued liabilities tally to more like $272 billion. These figures drop the official 43% funding ratio to only 24%. John Mauldin John Mauldin Official estimates of accrued liabilities understate funding shortfalls by assuming unrealistic investment returns into perpetuity. Over the past five- and ten-year periods, the five Illinois state pensions have discounted (underreported) their future liabilities by assuming rates of return between 7.0% and 8.5%. Every one of the state pension plans has significantly underperformed its return goals; and as we demonstrated last week, the next decade may be even more difficult from a returns perspective. Expecting more than an average of 4% nominal returns in the coming decade, given today's starting point, requires a large dollop of optimism. When you look at the plans' five-year returns, note that these funds had the benefit of a 140% US bull market over the last four years, and their ten-year returns had the benefit of two bull markets and just one bear market (though it was a savage one). John Mauldin The Illinois Policy Institute estimates the state pensions would need to earn a compound annual return of 19% from now through 2045 to make up the funding gap, while the markets may offer no more than 4% through the mid-2020s. Not even David Swensen at Yale can generate that kind of alpha. To reach their expected returns in a low-return environment, investment managers of these pensions would need to deliver 300 to 450 basis points of alpha, which would place them among the finest asset allocators in the world. Their recent track record suggests otherwise. I seem to remember that it was only a few years ago that I was writing that pension funding shortfalls in Illinois were a mere $50 billion. The plans' continued lackluster performance has now made the problem much worse,Â and any additional underperformance will lead to even larger funding shortfalls. Nothing But Bad Choices To ease their shortfall, Illinois is going to have to find an additional $82 billion over the next ten years, if you believe their optimistic return projections. The more realistic projection suggests they will need to find $210 billion. That works out to $8-$10 billion a year for the next ten years. Of course, every year they continue to underfund and underperform makes that number bigger, but let's be charitable and assume the problem won't get worse. Let's analyze what these numbers mean. Illinois is projecting approximately $35 billion of revenue for fiscal year 2014. Of this, 74% comes from individual income taxes (45%), sales taxes (21%), and corporate taxes (8%). The state of Illinois increased individual and business income tax rates in January 2011 to their current levels. These tax rates are set to roll back in January 2015 unless lawmakers vote to make them permanent. (Source: http://watchdog.org/94230/in-il-pension-reform-may-mean-tax-increase/) The first line below is individual, and the second line is business income tax rates. Pre-January 2011 Tax Rates Current Tax Rates Planned Tax Rates (After January 15 Drop) 3% 5% 3.85% 4.3% 7% 5.25% Having to vote to make already high tax rates permanent will make it difficult to then vote for even higher taxes (or at least one would think so). Let me quote directly from Gov. Pat Quinn's speech when he delivered the 2014 fiscal year budget. (Emphasis mine.) But this is also an honest budget that reflects our fiscal challenges â€¦ pays down the backlog of bills â€¦ and addresses funds that have been under-appropriated for too long.Â There are no gimmicks or fake numbers in this budget.Â This budget holds the line on discretionary spending, while fully meeting our skyrocketing pension obligations. Inaction on comprehensive pension reform has left our state with less revenue for our most important priorities.Â Without pension reform, within two years, Illinois will be spending more on public pensions than on education.Â As I said to you a year ago, our state cannot continue on this path. Pension reform is hard.Â But we've done hard things before. Maybe it's something in the water that makes Illinois politicians really good with rhetoric, but their math is a little hard for this Texas country boy to get his head around. The governor talks about a hard-fought agreement that saves $900 million over three years on pensions, but I look at this budget and can't seem to find the part about fully funding skyrocketing pension obligations. Pension contributions are planned to increase by $929 million, from $5.1 billion in FY2013 to $6.0 billion in FY2014. This falls short of the annual pension payout by $2 billion, meaning that unfunded liabilities will get worse every year until there is a fix. This shortfall could become a massive problem over time if the state government cannot significantly increase revenues to cover at least the growing annual payouts (or cut spending on public services or restructure pension liabilities). The state of Illinois projects that annual pension payouts will increase from $8 billion today to around $15 billion by 2022, to $20 billion by 2030, and to $30 billion by 2045. That is a total of $632 billion for pension benefits between now and 2045. For which the state of Illinois has set aside something like 10% of that total. How could anything possibly go wrong? (Source: http://illinoispolicy.org/uploads/files/Pension_debt_more_than_doubles.pdf) John Mauldin If the state were to increase individual income tax rates to cover these outlays, we would expect to see individual income tax rates rise from the current 5% to 12.5% by 2045. The longer Illinois waits to increase pension contributions, the bigger the unfunded liabilities will be and the higher tax rates will need to climb to make up for the shortfall. It may be painful to face the funding shortfall today, but the cost will balloon to enormous proportions in just a few years if lawmakers delay. Note again that the Illinois state constitution does not allow the state to reduce pension benefits. I will grant the governor this: looking at the budget, there have been significant cuts in many areas of spending. But the "easy" work has been done. While pension contributions made up roughly 6% of operating expenditures in 2008, they account for 19% today. That number will grow dramatically if left unchecked. Looks like we are already starting to see the fallout from recent education cuts: http://www.progressillinois.com/quick-hits/content/2013/06/26/cps-blames-deficit-il-pension-crisis-protesters-blast-budget-cuts-boar. Going back to the original proposition, the state of Illinois needs to find an additional $20 billion a year to adequately fund its future pension obligations, or it is going to be digging an ever deeper hole every year. But where do you find an extra $20 billion a year in a $35 billion budget? This is the sort of situation that is typically described by politicians as "somebody else's problem," but to our children it will be their problem. Promises Made, Promises Broken There are other states besides Illinois that have significant unfunded pension liabilities. As this letter is already getting a little longish, I will leave you with just a taste of what we will cover next week. There are several ways besides the absolute numbers that you can look at unfunded liabilities. You could divide the total liabilities by the number of people in the state, giving you the debt on a per capita basis. In a fascinating report, a group called State Budget Solutions did that work for us. Quoting: The states with the largest unfunded liability per person are Alaska ($32,425), Ohio ($24,893), Illinois ($22,294), Connecticut ($21,378) and New Mexico ($20,530). On the other hand, the states with the smallest unfunded liability per person are Tennessee ($5,676), Indiana ($6,581), North Carolina ($6,874), Nebraska ($7,212) and Arizona ($7,688). Another way to look at the debt problem is as a percentage of each state's gross state product, similar to the national GDP. That breaks down as follows: John Mauldin Yes, there are states worse than Illinois, depending on how you view the data. Next week we'll get into this a little deeper. I would like to invite those of my readers who have done the research on their particular city, county, or state to send me their data. If we get enough, we'll create one larger data set and post it. Unfunded liabilities have the potential to become just as big a problem as subprime credit or European sovereign debt. The problems are mounting, and while in most areas they can be dealt with today, the longer the solutions are put off, the less possible they will be. Either taxpayers will have to pay more, or benefits will have to be changed, or other services that people expect from local governments will have to be severely curtailed. That is the range of choices. None of them will sit well. One group in Illinois proposes, as a partial solution, to freeze all cost-of-living adjustments for current retirees, to abandon defined-benefit plans for current employees in favor of defined-contribution plans, to raise the retirement age, and to take other drastic steps. Last year a number of liberal cities in California, including San Jose and San Diego, voted to alter their pension plans rather than increase taxes. There comes a time when taxpayers simply say "No more!" On the other side of that equation are people who worked all their lives in expectation of a specific pension payout when they retired. To them a deal is a deal. There is no surer way to upset me personally than not to live up to a deal that has been agreed upon. The anger of government employees when threatened with the loss of their benefits is something I can readily understand. But I also get the plight of taxpayers who see political favors bought and sold using their money. And I get more than merely frustrated with politicians who pile financial commitments on the shoulders of our children so that they themselves don't have to figure out how to pay for them. I think most people feel the same way about these matters, but here are no good solutions. Ask Detroit. They put off the hard decisions, and now they're in bankruptcy court. The bankruptcy manager has threatened retirees with a far larger cut in their pensions than they might have negotiated a few years ago. City services have been cut, roads go unrepaired, most of the streetlights don't work, and there is not nearly enough money to cover fire and police services. That's what happens when you don't make the hard choices today. They become tomorrow's bad choices and next year's disastrous choices. Ask Greece. The Bull's in Charge Last week I participated in a great webinar, "How Long Can the Bull Run? A Discussion on Long/Short Equity," with members of the investment team at Altegris.Â We engaged in a robust discussion on the equity markets and provided a much-needed perspective on the role that a long/short equity strategy can play in a well-diversified portfolio. We talked about some strategic moves investors can make now, whether their long-term outlook is bullish or bearish. My old friend Matt Osborne, one of the founding partners of Altegris, inserted a recent cover from Barron's magazine into his PowerPoint presentation. I am sure I saw a little mischief in his eyes, and I'm pretty sure he did it just to tweak me. I had just outlined a rather cautionary viewpoint, laying out the case that hedging at this point might prove useful, and Matt thought he should remind me that the consensus is still quite bullish. I thought a very interesting discussion ensued. "The Bull's in Charge!" indeed. John Mauldin I was reminded of a recent graph from my friend John Hussman, which features three other Barron's covers. Some would say a Barron's cover like these is an invitation to the gods of the market to have a good laugh. I, however, am of the belief that these deities have no sense of humor whatsoever. Be that as it may, here is John's graph. I'll let you note the dates. John Mauldin If you want to continue to participate in the equity markets but are looking to lower your volatility and risk, I advise you to look closely at the long/short equity products Altegris offers.Â If you would like to view the webinar, you can see the entire replay here. Denver, Toronto, New York, Chicago, and Tucson I've spent the last few days in North Dakota speaking for BNC Bank. My hosts were exceptionally gracious. The first morning, I was picked up in Rapid City, South Dakota, by Loren Kopseng, who flew me up to Watford, North Dakota, after which we flew rather close to Mount Rushmore. Loren preferred to fly lower so that he could survey the terrain. I'm not sure just how low we flew, but I could almost read the numbers on the ear tags of the cattle. Loren grew up in that part of the world as a poor kid in the Badlands and knew the story of every ranch and town we flew over. It seemed that he had a cousin or knew a friend's cousin on pretty much every piece of property in that part of the state, as well as most of their history and gossip going back into the late 1800s. It was a fascinating six hours. I love that sort of stuff. Watford itself is the closest thing to a boomtown that I've ever experienced. It has visibly grown since the last time I was there, in November. Lying smack dab in the middle of the Bakken oil fields, it was a sleepy little town of less than 2,000 people just a few years ago, and now they are having to make plans to accommodate 8,000 to 10,000 just a few years from now. Mobile homes, campers, "man camps," and new hotels and apartments are sprouting everywhere. There are scores and scores of new businesses springing up all over the region just to serve the oil workers and the drilling rigs. Loren had a dozen stories about business startups, and the variety of businesses popping up is simply amazing. Who knew you could throw up a prefab metal warehouse just to house campers and charge up to $1500 per month for a parking spot? The guy was leasing out the warehouses as fast as he could build them, and it looked like there was a line of campers waiting for th e spots in the next new building. There are actual depressions in the asphalt roads from the tires of all the trucks running over them. You can stand at the top of the rise in the center of Watford, look back down the road for a mile and a half, and see nothing but trucks and more trucks lining up at the stoplights, ferrying water for fracking and hauling oil back from the wells to be put into rail cars and shipped to whoever pays the highest price that day. Millions of dollars' worth of natural gas is being flared into the air, waiting for a pipeline to gather the gas. You can see those flares in nighttime satellite photos. We stood near one of the larger ones and felt the immense heat. I reported last year that they were using up to 30 fracking pipes or "jewels" in a well. Today, advancing technology has taken the number to more than 40, and Loren thinks they will soon top 50. Five or six years ago they were using just one. The technology is changing rapidly, and the amount of oil being recovered is remarkable. That same technology is being applied to source rock in the Permian Basin, and it appears that the second-largest oilfield in the world might be in West Texas. The oilmen I talked to up in North Dakota are convinced from the drill results they are getting that there are four completely different levels of oil beneath the Bakken. Most of the sites that have been drilled are going to be drilled again over time, going deeper and farther more cheaply and with greater recovery. Those who predict this will be a short-lived field are going to be proven very wrong. Next week I go to Denver for a speech and dinner with my friends at Altegris Investments. The following week I'm off to Toronto, where I will have dinner with David Rosenberg and Louis Gave before speaking at Louis's conference. From there I'll go to New York for meetings and another presentation for Altegris. The next week sees another speech in Chicago (if I am allowed into the state after this week's letter), before I head to Tucson for the Casey Summit, October 4-6. As usual, they have an all-star lineup of speakers, including my friends Ron Paul, Lacy Hunt, Don Coxe, and of course Doug Casey. It is late and time to hit the send button. I started this letter on the plane back from Minneapolis yesterday. Your humble analyst can occasionally be less aware than he should be of what is going on around him, and I realized as I got off the plane that I had left my billfold on a table in a sandwich shop back in Minneapolis. I've left credit cards before but not an entire billfold. Fortunately, I have three miracle workers who help me out of jams (Mary, my personal assistant, who also schedules my speaking engagements; Shannon, who handles the money and operations; and Myra, who handles my travel). I texted them as I got off the plane. No, I didn't know the name of the place where I had left the wallet, and I wasn't exactly sure where it was, just somewhere along Terminal E. A few minutes later Shannon had the name of the shop, and Myra worked her magic and got some very helpful person from American Airlines to rescue my billfold and drop it in a FedEx package. All done before I even had time to get home. I really should learn to pay attention to these things. Have a great week. Mine will be much better now â€“ thank you, ladies.

PBS NewshourAndrew LoProfessor Krugman writes: Heads They Win, Tails We Lose Many years ago MIT’s Andy Lo made a simple point (weirdly, I haven’t been able to track down the paper) about the distortion of incentives inherent in financial-industry compensation. Suppose you’re a hedge fund manager, getting 2 and 20 — fees of 2 percent of investors’ money, plus 20 percent of profits. What you want to do is load up on as much leverage as possible, and make high-risk, high return investments. This more or less guarantees that your fund will eventually go bust — but in the meantime you’ll have raked in huge personal earnings, and can walk away filthy rich from the wreckage. But surely, you say, investors will see through this strategy. They can’t consistently be that stupid or naive, can they? Hahahaha. Andy Lo's article was published in the Financial Analysts Journal in 2001: Risk Management for Hedge Funds: Introduction and Overview. An online copy is available here. Jim Hamilton at Econbrowser has a nice summary from 2005: Hedge fund risk [L]et me tell you about one fund I do know about called CDP, which was described by MIT Professor Andrew Lo in an article published in Financial Analysts Journal in 2001. 1992-1999 was a good time to be in stocks-- a strategy of buying and holding the S&amp;P 500 would have earned you a 16% annual return, with $100 million invested in 1992 growing to $367 million by 1999. As nice as this was, it pales in comparison to CDP's strategy, which would have turned $100 million into $2.7 billion, a 41% annual compounded return, with a positive return in every single year. Of course the strategy would eventually go bust, but the managers would be rich!!!
Jay YarowBob Seawrightâ€™s excellent post on the Most Dangerous Ideas got me thinking â€“ what really is the most dangerous idea in finance and economics today? In my opinion, this is an easy one. Â The most dangerous idea in the USA is this idea that the USA has â€œrun out of moneyâ€ or that our government cannot afford to do certain things. Iâ€™ve explained this many times before, but this is a myth that just wonâ€™t die. Â  Hereâ€™s my previous explanation as to why the myth of governmentÂ insolvency is indeed dangerous: â€œThe USA has an institutional arrangement in which it is a contingent currency issuer. That is, while the Treasury is an operational currency user (meaning it must always have funds in its account at the Fed before it can spend those funds) it has the extraordinary power to tax and issue risk free bonds that the public will always desire to hold so long as inflation is not extraordinarily high. In addition, even in a worst case scenario, the US Treasury can always rely on the Federal Reserve to supply the funds necessary to fund its spending. Â Therefore, the US government can be thought of as a contingent currency issuer who can issue the funds to spend. Â This makes it very different from a household.â€ Itâ€™s just impossible for the US government to run out of money. Â In fact, the real threat in the USA is not running out of money, but creating too much money! Â In other words, when politicians talk about the debt ceiling and how we â€œcanâ€™t affordâ€ this or that theyâ€™re getting everything backwards. Â  Now, itâ€™s important to get the context of this discussion correct. Â When I say that the USA canâ€™t run out of money I am not saying that the government can just spend money like crazy or that there is no constraint at all. Â I am just saying that the US governmentâ€™s printing press doesnâ€™t ever break (which should be rather obvious). Â Hereâ€™s the most crucial piece: â€œOf course, this means the constraint for the government is different from that of a household or business who can really â€œrun out of moneyâ€. Â The US governmentâ€™s constraint is not that it will run out of funds, but that it could supply too much liquidity to the private sector thereby causing inflation. Â So the US governmentâ€™s real constraint is inflation and not solvency. Â This is a vastly different issue than the one the US media usually harps on with regards to the budget deficit and the US governmentâ€™s ability to â€œaffordâ€ its spending.â€ I donâ€™t know about you, but the data seems to confirm that inflation is not very high and aggregate demand is way too low. Â If anything, the government could run much higher budget deficits (for instance, by cutting everyoneâ€™s taxes) and while that might induce some inflation, it might also put more money in peopleâ€™s pockets which would help generate higher corporate revenues, more hiring and a stronger overall economy. Â  What a tax cut wonâ€™t do is cause us to eventually â€œrun out of money.â€ Â But Congress sure thinks it will. Â And thatâ€™s a dangerously misguided understanding of the monetary system we have.

The economy is still plodding along at barely above â€œstall speedâ€, falling short of forecasts by the Fed and most Wall Street strategists and economists.Â  Employment has increased by an average of only 160,000 a month over the last six months with an unusually high proportion of new jobs in low paying segments of the economy.Â  Although initial unemployment claims have dropped significantly, businesses are still reluctant to hire. GDP grew at an average annual rate of 1.8% in the 1st half, and, according to Moodyâ€™s Analytics, is tracking at a rate of only 1.4% in the 3rd quarter, based on results released to date.Â  In addition, with wages rising at a tepid rate, and household savings rates historically low, the ability of consumers to spend remains restrained at best.Â  Capital expenditures are also being held back by continuing excess capacity and too much vacant office space. Despite the economic weakness, the Fed appears committed to start the process of tapering back quantitative easing (QE).Â  Journalists close to the Fedâ€™s thinking now believe that the FOMC is likely to begin the tapering process at next weekâ€™s meeting, although the cutback may be minimal at the start.Â  The key takeaway, though, is that a stimulus program that was previously open-ended, with an implied â€œputâ€ under the market, now appears to have a finite end.Â  That makes a big difference in the way investors perceive the program, as is evident by the soaring yields in bond rates since Bernanke first mentioned the possibility of tapering in May. All of this is happening at a time of unusual political uncertainty.Â  Although the market has breathed a sigh of relief over Putinâ€™s proposal to defuse the Syrian crisis, the outcome is still in great doubt as both Russia and Syria are attaching conditions to their plan, and the process of eliminating chemical weapons and verifying their removal are exceedingly difficult.Â  In addition the rest of the Mid-East is still a tinder box ready to explode at any time. Washington is also facing a standoff between the White House and the Republican base over the Federal budget and the debt limit that, once again, threatens to shut down the government or result in further spending cuts in a fragile economy.Â  The market is assuming that the impasse will be settled at the last minute.Â  While that is more probable than not, whatever compromise gets us to a solution is also likely to have negative consequences for the economy and market.  In sum, with the market already selling at close to 20 times cyclically smoothed reported earnings, the vulnerability to a severe decline seems similar to that of early 2000 and late 2007.
