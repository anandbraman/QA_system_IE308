Unemployed herdsmen are among those who have turned to gold mining in an effort to eke out a living.

These miners, referred to as ninja miners because they often work at night, and because they carry green pans that resemble the shells of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, dig with the most rudimentary tools. They also aren't given a license because the government says they destroy the environment. Some 100,000 people are said to work in the unregulated mines and earn as little as $8 a day, according to the BBC. Ninja miners are constantly shoved onto smaller pieces of land by mining giants. Most recently locals have been protesting Oyu Tolgoi, a copper-and-gold mine that is the biggest foreign-investment project in the country.

U.S. Stocks Will Probably Fall (The Wall St. Journal) The Dow recently hit the 14,000 mark, and stocks are near pre-recession levels. Some experts are worried that the U.S. stock market is starting to look expensive and advisors are bracing themselves for a pullback. "Stocks look pretty frothy at this point, and technically speaking, the market seems poised for about a 4% retrenchment," Gregg Schriro, a portfolio manager at United Asset Strategies, told the WSJ. Persistent political turmoil could exacerbate such a fall especially with blue-chip stocks. The Dow Could Be Stuck Around 14,000 For Some Time (LPL Financial) In the past, whenever the Dow has passed a round number benchmark, like 12,000 or 13,000, it's always taken it close to a year, to hit the next round number benchmark, said LPL Financials' Jeff Kleintop, in a note. "For each of these round numbers (11,000, 12,000, and 13,000) the Dow has crossed in the past few years, it has taken the better part of a year for the market to break free of a period of ups and downs after reaching the milestone before beginning to move toward the next one. The current levels on the index may linger for six or more months." LPL Financial  The Stock Market Will Dip And Rally A Bit More, Before It Plunges (Nomura) The stock market could see a few more dips and rallies before it plunges, said Nomura's Bob Janjuah in a note. "There is not yet sufficient leverage in risk-on positioning in my view. I think we need at least another round or two of ëbuying the dipí before we can consider positioning to be at extreme enough levels to set up the conditions necessary for a major sell-off (25% to 50%) as opposed to a minor correction (5% to 10%)." "...A weekly close at a new all-time high would I think lead to the final parabolic spike up which creates the kind of positioning extreme and leverage extreme needed to create the conditions for a 25% to 50% collapse in equities over the rest of 2013 and 2014, driven by real economy reality hitting home, and by policymaker failure/loss of faith in 'their system'." Bond ETFs Are An Accident Waiting To Happen (TF Market Advisors) "The growing use of ETFs by institutions is a key part of that self-reinforcing feedback loop. "...A now regular occurrence is a bond trader gets ìliftedî in the morning or sells bonds and is left short. That trader waits all day hoping to find a seller of those bonds. At the end of the day, rather than lifting an ìegregiousî offer, or going home short, they will buy some ETFs to cover the market risk. Of course the next morning, everyone sees the spike in the ETF and views it as a sign that the market got really strong into the close, so they try to buy more bonds. This behavior first became noticeable in the credit markets with the creation of CDS indices but is now occurring with more frequency in the ETF space. "The 'arbitrage' community also plays a role in these loops, especially when quoted bond ìpricesî donít reflect the reality of where the bonds would trade." This is really risky, said Tchir, as this loop could break at anytime, causing the corporate bond ETF market to fall, but it is unlikely that this will happen soon. "I donít see anything to trigger this loop right now. Europe is doing some things to reduce risk. The Fed is pumping money into the system," he said.

Examiner.comChipotle's fourth quarter earnings release is out. Click here to refresh for LIVE updates &gt; The company reported earnings of $1.95 per share, right in line with expectations. Revenues came in at $699.2 million, also right in line. Same-store sales also matched expectations, up 3.8 percent in the fourth quarter. Remember ‚Äì Chipotle pre-announced these results in mid-January, so they shouldn't come as a surprise. The company says it sees 2013 sales growth unchanged or in low single digits. Shares are up over 5 percent in after-hours trading. Below is the full text from the release: DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE: CMG) today reported financial results for its fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2012. Highlights for the fourth quarter of 2012 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2011 include: Highlights for the twelve months ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the prior year include: ‚ÄúDuring 2012, we remained focused on our mission to change the way people think about and eat fast food. We're rewriting the fast food rules, sourcing more and more sustainably raised ingredients and respecting farmers, the environment, animals, and ultimately our customers. Our food culture has always set us apart from other fast food restaurants by using great quality ingredients and preparing food using classic cooking techniques in open kitchens on display for all to see. People appreciate these things and we‚Äôll continue to stay focused on them,‚Äù said Steve Ells, Founder, Chairman and Co-CEO of Chipotle. Results for the fourth quarter 2012 Revenue for the quarter was $699.2 million, up 17.2% from the prior year period. The growth in revenue was the result of new restaurants not in the comparable base and a 3.8% increase in comparable restaurant sales. Comparable restaurant sales growth was primarily driven by the impact of increased traffic. During the quarter we opened 60 new restaurants, bringing the total restaurant count to 1,410. Food costs were 33.5% of revenue, an increase of 130 basis points driven by higher commodity costs. Higher commodity costs were primarily driven by increases in beef costs including steak and barbacoa, and to a lesser extent by increases in the cost of salsa ingredients and dairy. Restaurant level operating margin was 24.6% in the quarter, a decrease of 150 basis points from the prior year period. The decrease was primarily driven by higher food costs. G&amp;A costs were 6.2% of revenue, down 20 basis points from the prior year period due to favorable sales leverage. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2012 was $61.4 million, or $1.95 per diluted share, compared to $57.5 million, or $1.81 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2011. Results for the full year ended December 31, 2012 Revenue for the full year of 2012 was $2.73 billion, up 20.3% from the prior year period. The growth in revenue was the result of new restaurants not in the comparable base and a 7.1% increase in comparable restaurant sales. Comparable restaurant sales growth was primarily driven by increased traffic as well as the impact from menu price increases, most of which were taken in 2011. During the full year, we opened 183 new Chipotle restaurants, bringing the total restaurant count to 1,410. Restaurant level operating margin was 27.1% for the full year 2012, an increase of 110 basis points from the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by the impact of leverage from higher restaurant sales partially offset by higher food costs. G&amp;A costs for the full year 2012 were 6.7% of revenue, 10 basis points higher than the prior year. The increase as a percent of revenue was driven by higher non-cash stock based compensation expense and the biennial All Managers' Conference, partially offset by the positive impact of comparable restaurant sales growth. Net income for the full year 2012 was $278.0 million, or $8.75 per diluted share, compared to $214.9 million, or $6.76 per diluted share for 2011. Our Board of Directors has also approved the investment of up to an additional $100 million, exclusive of commissions, to repurchase shares of our common stock. This repurchase authorization, in addition to up to approximately $80 million available as of February 5th for repurchases under previously announced repurchase authorizations, may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time. ‚ÄúOur empowered restaurant teams once again were able to attract more people into our restaurants, creating positive comparable sales at Chipotle despite a sluggish economy and the roll off of our price increase. We feel confident in our continued ability to drive sales growth in 2013 through a combination of new restaurant growth and our top performing, empowered restaurant teams creating an extraordinary dining experience for our customers,‚Äù said Monty Moran, co-CEO of Chipotle. Outlook For 2013, management expects the following: The following definitions apply to these terms as used throughout this release: Comparable restaurant sales represent the change in period-over-period sales for the comparable restaurant base. A restaurant becomes comparable in its 13th full calendar month of operation. Average restaurant sales refers to the average trailing 12-month sales for restaurants in operation for at least 12 full calendar months. Restaurant level operating margin represents total revenue less restaurant operating costs, expressed as a percent of total revenue.

Click here for the full release &gt; ---------------- ORIGINAL:¬†Minutes away from Chipotle Mexican Grill's fourth-quarter 2012 earnings report, expected out just after the closing bell at 4 PM ET. Analysts expect the fast-food chain to report earnings of $1.95 per share (matching company guidance) down from $2.30 in Q3. Sales are expected to come in at $699 million, down slightly from $700.5 million in Q3 and just below company guidance of $699.2 million. Chipotle pre-announced this release in mid-January, which is where the guidance numbers above come from. The stock fell 5 percent on the news, but has since rallied 3 percent above the level it was trading at before the pre-announcement. BofA Merrill Lynch analyst Joseph Buckley, Andrew Charles, and Gregory Francfort say this is because Chipotle faces short-term headwinds but has a relatively brighter long-term outlook. In a note to clients, they write: Sentiment has shifted more positively, in our view, just two weeks after the pre-announcement of disappointing 4Q 2012 results. The pre- release seemed to clarify near term issues and enable investors to focus on the company‚Äôs long term growth metrics. Near term results are likely to remain challenging until Chipotle raise prices to deal with higher food costs. Management acknowledged a greater probability of raising menu prices in mid-2013 following the margin/cost driven 4Q disappointment.  Chipotle‚Äôs appealing long term attributes include low-to-mid teen percentage unit growth with the ability to more than triple the domestic core brand restaurant count, outstanding new unit economics, and two promising nascent businesses in ShopHouse and the international business. We also think more aggressive share repurchases in 4Q (473,000 shares at an average cost of $284 per share) is reassuring to investors. On same-store sales figures, Deutsche Bank analysts Jason West and Justin Marshall say buy-side investors are a bit more bullish than the sell side. In a note to clients, they write: Our buy side survey of CMG SSS suggests the buy side is slightly above the sell side on 2013 comps, though the gap is marginal. Our survey (~20 responses) avg‚Äôd +2.3% for 1Q13, +3.9% for 2Q13, +5.0% for 3Q13, and +5.3% for 4Q13. ~40bps above Consensus Metrix on avg. (+1.3%, +3.6%, +4.8%, +5.0% for 1Q-4Q13) Both forecasts seem to assume modest (~2%) menu pricing in 2H13, consistent w/ our expectation. These forecasts also embed a gradual decline in 2-yr. comp trends over the course of 2013. We will have Chipotle's full Q4 2012 earnings release at 4 PM ET.

AP ImagesStocks recovered most of yesterday's losses. First the scoreboard: Dow: 13,979, +99.2, +0.7 percentS&amp;P 500: 1,511, +15.5, +1.0 percentNASDAQ: 3,171, +40.4, +1.2 percent And now the top stories:
Earlier, I wrote about what Dell was likely to do now that it is taking itself private. I suggested that Michael Dell and his private-equity backers would coin money, in part by paying themselves a huge one-time dividend with the cash sitting on Dell's balance sheet. I also bemoaned the fact that Michael Dell had to take his company private to coin this money instead of executing his plan as a public company and sharing the loot with his current shareholders. More broadly, I complained that too few public-company management teams (like Dell's) have the balls to tell short-term public-market investors to take a hike and implement long-term strategic plans. And that is indeed a bummer. But it's also the reality. Most public-company management teams are so cowed by Wall Street's short-term demands that they sacrifice the vision and cojones that enabled them to build big public companies in the first place. And then they just manage their companies from quarter to quarter while avoiding the tough, ballsy decisions that separate great companies from good ones. Anyway, Dell has decided to go private. So the questions are: Earlier, I speculated about what a generic private-equity firm might do with Dell after taking it private. I have since spoken with sources familiar with the specific Dell situation. So I have some better information. Here's what the sources told me: The private-equity firm backing Dell, Silver Lake, has a long history of investing in troubled tech companies, and it has posted excellent returns over the years. Silver Lake's target investment time horizon is about 5 years, which is about 100-times longer than the time horizon of the typical public-market investor. So Silver Lake is willing to depress Dell's earnings and cash flow for a couple of the years while investing heavily to transform the company--thus, hopefully, creating a more valuable Dell over the long term. (Public market investors and wimpy management teams take note: Your obsession with quarterly performance creates the opportunity for firms like Silver Lake to come along and buy your companies on the cheap, thus coining money for their private-market investors. In short, your quarterly earnings obsession is ruining companies and destroying value. So grow a pair, tell Wall Street to be patient, and focus on creating value for the long term!)

This will hurt profit margins but make the company's solutions more attractive to customers. And given that the focus is now on "solutions," they'll be looking to sell the hardware at closer to cost and then make money on add-on software and services. 
One of the most controversial stories of the economic recovery has been the historically high corporate profit margins. High and rising profit margins have caused corporate profits to surge even as GDP inched only modestly higher.¬† And these expanding margins are largely attributable to companies freezing hiring or cutting their workforces.¬† This explains why unemployment has remained persistently high. So, have profit margins topped out? Analysts don't think so.¬† In fact, analysts expect margins to continue to climb through at least 2014. Here's some commentary from Goldman Sachs' David Kostin, who expects margins to level off: Bottom-up consensus currently forecasts net margins will rise to 9.3%. In contrast, our top-down forecast suggests margins will remain in the narrow band of 8.7%-8.9% where they have hovered for the past two years. However, with 51% of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 having reported 4Q 2012 results, margins appear to have slipped on a trailing four-quarter basis to 8.5%. ...earnings are far more sensitive to changes in margins than GDP or sales growth. A 50 bp shift in margins equals $5 per share. Our current EPS forecast of $107 and $114 for 2013 and 2014, respectively, represents annual growth of about 10% and 7% and assumes trailing four- quarter margins creep from 8.5% in 2012 to 8.9% in 2013 and 9.0% in 2014. Here's a chart of the forecasted margin trajectories. Goldman Sachs
BusinessWeekMany commentators are freaking out about a new Barron's headline celebrating the arrival (actually return) of the Dow Jones Industrial Average passing 14,000. We'll refrain from singling any one out. But the belief is that the following from¬†Barron's means the market is about to tank:¬†"We told you so. In October, we predicted the Dow would pass its 14,165 record by early this year. Now we're just 1% short. Expect a breakthrough soon. Here's what happens after that." More generally, there are people who get nervous any time there's an article talks about a new bull market, or how everyone's into stocks, or how we've just breached a new era. Basically, there are a lot of people who reflexively get negative, just because people have turned bearish. As Josh Brown has noted, this so-called "headline" or "magazine cover" risk is total nonsense. A magazine cover is just a magazine cover. A headline is just a headline. A big benchmark is just a big benchmark. We went through the history of the Dow, from the 1960s to today, to prove why this is complete hogwash. (Many thanks to Barry Ritholtz¬†and, again, Josh Brown for digging up some of the "deader" of the dead trees...)
APComing up on March 1st is the automatic implementation of sequestration cuts. These cuts uniformly and bluntly cut each and every government program by the same percentage across the board. The reason these cuts are going into effect is that Congress was unable to reach an agreement following the 2011 debt ceiling crisis, and their failure to compromise has led to a situation that both parties regret.¬† The sequestration cuts will have a devastating impact on the economy. The austerity program is estimated to cause the loss of a baseline 1 million jobs, shaking an already fragile recovery to its core. Impacted the most by the austerity cuts will be middle class families and working class people in the manufacturing industry. The cuts are expected to delay a full recovery by a year and potentially initiate a recession. However, several members of Congress have produced a plan that balances the way the U.S. pays down the deficit, removing the austerity cuts in lieu of loophole closures. Moreover, the plan involves additional infrastructure investments in roads and schools designed to stimulate the sluggish recovery rather than hamstring it.¬† The issue? It's a very long shot to pass. Actually, it has zero chance. Democratic progressive Representatives Keith Ellison and Raul Grijalva have sent out a new budget plan "The Balancing Act" as an alternative to sequestration, Greg Sargent at WonkBlog reports. The plan has three phases of deficit reduction, two of which have already occurred. This becomes a $3.3 trillion deficit reduction over the long term.¬† But the most important part is an injection of stimulus into the economy in the form of infrastructure spending and other aspects of the American Jobs Act.¬† This is paid for by cutting $278 billion in defense and re-purposing it for domestic investment with the intention of creating jobs domestically.¬† The $948 billion sequestration replacement is comprised of closing certain loopholes and decreasing deductions. Over time, these would cancel out the ten year automatic austerity package of sequestration:¬† (Via Greg Sargent)

Wikimedia CommonsThe Canadian government has begun to phase out the penny, saying it's too expensive to produce the coin. Besides its "excessive" production value, Canada has long cited the significant handling costs for the nation's retailers and environmental considerations that lessen the penny's worth. The country, which produced its last pennies on Monday, estimates the move will save taxpayers about $11 million a year. The potential savings have enticed U.S. officials to consider the possibility as well. Cash transactions in Canada will now be rounded to the nearest 5-cent mark. The penny's retirement will have no effect on payments made by checks or credit cards. For example, if the total price of coffee and a sandwich is $4.92, a customer that was paying in cash would owe $4.90, according to the Royal Canadian Mint. But those using another method of payment would pay $4.92, and the pennies would be tallied electronically. The cost of the metal that goes into a penny has surged in recent years, making the coin's production more expensive than its face value. In the U.S., it now cost 2.41 cents to make every penny, which is made mostly of zinc. The penny has cost more than its face value since 2006. Although the U.S. has conducted significant research into alternatives for the penny, the U.S. Mint says it still needs more research before it can make a decision to either change its composition or do away with it altogether. Any new materials for the penny would need to simulate the current look and durability of the nation's most circulated coin. sbomkamp@tribune.com -- Twitter: @SamWillTravel ___ (c)2013 the Chicago Tribune Visit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.com Distributed by MCT Information Services

MSNBCThe Bipartisan Policy Center ó an independent group with a long track record of accurate prognostication ó has confirmed that they expect massive job losses across the board if Congress is unable to avert the sequester.† The prediction isn't without immediate evidence, either. The contraction in GDP last week was largely attributed to decrease in government funding allocated to manufacturing in the defense sector, which has seen a substantial cut as a result of the Budget Control Act of 2011 mandatory spending caps and the gradual end of overseas conflicts.† Here's the key quote from the Bipartisan Policy Center emphasizing how bad sequestration could be in the short term: CBO estimated a decline of 0.7 percent in 2013 gross domestic product (GDP) growth because of the ripple effect of the sequester cuts on smaller businesses and on government personnel. For an economy that already suffers from chronic unemployment and very slow expansion, the sequester could push the nation into sub-2 percent GDP growth for 2013 and perhaps 2014. [...] Our estimate of approximately one million lost jobs due to sequester remains our base case if a full sequester occurs as scheduled on March 1. As it stands, the ball is in Congress' court when it comes to averting the across the board cuts. The President spoke today about the need to avert sequestration, and Senator Patty Murray, the chair of the Budget Committee has explained how deeply the cuts could shake an already fragile recovery.†
Courtesy of CSPANRepublican House Majority Leader Eric Cantor will lay out a new vision for the GOP in a highly-anticipated speech at the American Enterprise Institute Wednesday, part of an ongoing push to reshape the party in the wake of last year's embarrassing election losses.† The speech ó which has been billed as a major shift in the GOP's domestic agenda ó largely avoids major policy pronouncements. Instead, Cantor echoes other Republicans in calling for an expanded conservative agenda that goes beyond the relentless battles over spending cuts and balanced budgets. Significantly, that includes a new push for school vouchers, Medicaid and Medicare reforms, workforce training initiatives, and limited immigration reforms. As we've previously pointed out, the 'shift' Cantor is pushing for is rhetorical, rather than substantive. His speech is not an attempt to moderate conservative policies, but rather soften the tone of the party's message within the framework of movement conservative principles.† Read the full text of the speech below:† Thank you Arthur. Arthur, youíve been an inspiration for me, and so many of my colleagues.The work of Arthur and his colleagues at AEI has demonstrated an incredible understanding of how conservatism leads to better lives for us all. Your insight and commitment in this vein has only begun to pay dividends. I really appreciate your counsel and friendship.†In Washington, over the past few weeks and months, our attention has been on cliffs, debt ceilings and budgets, on deadlines and negotiations. All of this is very important, as there is no substitute for getting our fiscal house in order. There is no greater moral imperative than to reduce the mountain of debt facing us, our children and theirs. The House Republican Majority stands ready for President Obama and his party to finally join us in our efforts to tackle the big problems facing America.But today, I'd like to focus our attention on what lies beyond these fiscal debates. Over the next two years, the House Majority will pursue an agenda based on a shared vision of creating the conditions for health, happiness and prosperity for more Americans and their families. And to restrain Washington from interfering in those pursuits.†We will advance proposals aimed at producing results in areas like education, health care, innovation and job growth. Our solutions will be based on the conservative principles of self reliance, faith in the individual, trust in the family and accountability in government. Our goal ñ to ensure every American has a fair shot at earning their success and achieving their dreams.It is my hope, that I can stand before you in two years and report back that our side, as well as the President's, found within us the ability to set differences aside, to provide relief to so many millions of Americans who simply want their life to work again.†In so many countries throughout history, children were largely consigned to the same station in life as their parents. But not here. In America, the son of a shoe salesman can grow up to be President. In America, the daughter of a poor single mother can grow up to own her own television network. In America, the grandson of poor immigrants who fled religious persecution in Russia can become the Majority Leader of the U.S. House of Representatives.†In America, in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, two bicycle shop mechanics gave mankind the gift of flight. The Wright brothers flew only 22 feet, 18 feet in the air, but they performed a miracle. As a result, only 66 years later, this great country of ours put a man on the moon and brought him back. We can do an enormous amount. Thatís who we are.The Wright brothersí father, Milton, first inspired his sons with a toy helicopter. But he never wanted Orville and Wilbur to fly together, for fear he would lose them both. In 1910, seven years after the boysí first flight, Milton gave them permission to fly together, the only time they ever did, and it lasted six minutes. Later that day, Orville took 82-year-old Milton on the only flight of his life. It lasted seven minutes, rising 350 feet, while his elderly father shouted: ìHigher, Orville, higher.îWhat a great commentary. In America, we do have higher expectations for our nation. Since our founding, we believed we could be the best hope to mankind. That hope led generations of immigrants to risk everything, to endure a tough journey to our shores, looking for a better future.†The driving motivation for millions of immigrants passing by Lady Liberty in New York Harbor was the generation that came after them. And because of that hope ñ those high expectations ñ coupled with a determination to see them come true, every generation since has had it better off than the one before. Until now.†Lately, it has become all too common in our country to hear parents fear whether their children will indeed have it better than they have. And for all of us parents, that is a scary thought. Let's face it. It has gotten a lot tougher to raise a family here in America. Our goal should be to eliminate this doubt gripping our nationís families, and to restore their hope and confidence so that parents can once again see a better tomorrow for their children.†Together, my wife Diana and I raised our three children, Evan, Jenna and Mikey, and we couldn't be more proud of the young adults they have become. Our nest is now empty, but I understand the pressure all parents are under, and the trying times they go through.†Parents working, saving for school, paying for braces, helping with homework and going from one after-school activity to the next. It's not easy.That's why we worry so much. Where can you find an affordable home in a good neighborhood to raise your kids? Which health care plan can I afford that allows you to see your doctors? Will the children make it through high school and get into a college of their choice, and if so, can you afford it? What about a career? Will that be available to them? These are real life concerns. This is what keeps parents awake at night fearful that life won't work out the way they hoped.During the last several years with the stagnant economy, too many mothers and fathers have had to come home, walk into the kitchen and tell their families they didnít have a job anymore. How does a family like that save for a rainy day, when it just got tough to even make it through the next month?†These families are desperate to wake up in the morning and have the nightmare over. The best way to restore their hope for the future and to heal our country is by making opportunity a reality for them and everyone. This comes with a growing economy, business expansion and start-ups creating jobs.†Just like parents, Washington must start showing care for the generations ahead while leaving the parenting to the parents.†Government policy should aim to strike a balance between what is needed to advance the next generation, what we can afford, what is a federal responsibility and what is necessary to ensure our children are safe, healthy and able to reach their dreams.†Opportunity and the belief in a better tomorrow start with an education system that works. In an 1822 letter, Thomas Jefferson wrote: ìI look to the diffusion of light and education as the resource to be relied on for ameliorating the condition, promoting the virtue, and advancing the happiness of man."With an eye toward Mr. Jeffersonís vision, since 1965, the federal government has poured hundreds of billions of dollars into improving schools in low-income areas ñ over $15 billion just last year. And frankly, the results have not matched the investment.†Joining us here today is Joseph Kelley and his family. A heroic Dad, Joseph worried that the public school wasnít helping his son. Rashawn flunked the first grade, and by fifth grade was three years behind on most subjects. The school actually put him in special education classes. Joseph would try and sit in on classes in order to help Rashawn, but was met with hostility, and even had to obtain a court order so Rashawn could have a tutor.†Violence was so prevalent in Rashawnís schools that eight D.C. police officers patrolled it on a daily basis. Mr. Kelly heard of the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program and dedicated himself to making sure Rashawn and his three sisters could gain access to a school that would put them on a path to graduation, and college ñ an opportunity he himself did not have.Within two years at a private school, Rashawn caught up to his classmates, and is now a student at the University of the District of Columbia. And his sisters, Domonique, Shakeyta and Rhunetta, are attending the Preparatory School of DC and are on a similar path to opportunity.†I visited this school yesterday, and it is impressive. The kids are in a safe environment, with great teachers, terrific administrators, small class sizes and a mission that every kid succeeds.No one should deny Rashawn and his sisters this opportunity. Joseph Kelley, nor any parent, should have to wait for failing school systems to get their acts together. Throughout the country there are promising signs that we can bring schools and parents together to improve our educational system.†San Francisco Public Schools adopted a funding mechanism according to whatís termed a "weighted student formula." Under this policy, the more students a school attracts, the more money that school, its administrators and teachers receive. Low-income students are weighted heavier in the funding formula as are children with disabilities, and those learning English as a second language. So, there's incentive for schools to seek the more vulnerable population, and reasons for schools to differentiate themselves and excel.†Imagine if we were to try and move in this direction with federal funding. Allow the money we currently spend to actually follow individual children. Students, including those without a lot of money or those with special needs, would be able to access the best available school, not just the failing school they are assigned to.†And their options ought to include not just public schools or private schools, but also charter schools. A competitive environment, where schools compete for students rather than the other way around, gives every child from the inner city of Washington to the streets of Los Angeles, an equal chance at a greater destiny.†One of our priorities this year will be to move heaven and earth to fix our education system for the most vulnerable. And when those children graduate from high school, we must expand their choices and college should be a viable option. In 1980, the average cost of college was roughly $8,000 a year. Today, it is over $20,000, and less than 60% of the students who enroll in a four-year program graduate within six years. Clearly, something is broken.†According to President Obamaís former jobs council, by 2020 there will be 1.5 million jobs without the college graduates to fill them. While there is a persistent unmet demand of 400,000 to 500,000 job openings in the health care sector alone. Recent reports indicate there are not enough applicants with the skills necessary to fill the jobs in the booming natural gas industry in America.Suppose colleges provided prospective students with reliable information on the unemployment rate and potential earnings by major. What if parents had access to clear and understandable breakdowns between academic studies and amenities? Armed with this knowledge, families and students could make better decisions about where to go to school, and how to budget their tuition dollars. Students would actually have a better chance of graduating within four years and getting a job.†Helping students realize opportunity and a career, while keeping tuition costs low makes common sense. Senators Rubio and Wyden have a proposal that they unveiled here at AEI, which addresses this goal. I look forward to working with them and Chairman John Kline in pursuing legislative action in the House.Over the course of this Congress, we will also work to reform our student aid process to give students a financial incentive to finish their studies sooner. We will encourage entrepreneurship in higher education, including for-profit schools. And we will fix the way we subsidize education by making the costs more transparent to parents, students and the millions of taxpayers who help pay some of the bill. We owe it to them.†A good education leads to more innovation. Throughout our history, American colleges and universities have served as the crucible for the world's innovation. They are a big part of why the United States remains the destination for the world's best and brightest. Investment in education leads to innovation, which leads to more opportunity and jobs for all. Our problem? The investment we make is not yielding maximum returns.†Each year our colleges and universities graduate approximately 40,000 foreign nationals with Masters and PhDs, many of whom are then forced to leave the country because there are not enough visa slots in our immigration system to permit them to stay. So rather than being able to invent things here in America, grow businesses or start one on their own, they do all of those things somewhere else.†Fiona Zhou is here today. She is earning her Masterís degree at the George Washington University School of Engineering and Applied Science. Originally from China, sheís been in the U.S. for five years, studying operations research in the systems engineering department. Sheís pretty smart. She would like to stay here and invest her talents in America, and maybe even start her own company. But she has seen too many of her friends with advanced degrees have to go back home despite sharing her same dreams and aspirations.†Last year, the House passed the bipartisan STEM Jobs Act which helped fix this problem. We will act again in this Congress, and we hope the Senate chooses to join us this time. I look forward to Fiona realizing her dreams and our country reaping the rewards of her hard work and talent.Whether itís college or the cost of daycare, making life work for more families means reducing the economic insecurity plaguing so many working moms and dads. Over the last 20 years, the world has changed. It used to be that one could make a career out of working for one company. Today, the average worker stays at his or her job for barely four years.†Median income in 2010 was about the same as it was in 1997. Experts correctly point out that this statistic ignores that many working families are getting more benefits like health care from their employer and not just wages.†But, explaining that rising health care costs are depressing take-home pay is little consolation to a working mom. Her grocery bills are higher, her kids' school needs are more expensive, rent is up ñ and now, she's just trying to get by. And getting by is not the American Dream.†As job markets are changing, more skills training and education are needed. Federal jobs training programs ought to make it easier for Americans who are out of work or who are changing careers to get the skills they need.†Yet today, the federal government has a patchwork of over 47 different overlapping programs that are not dynamic or innovative enough to meet the needs of employers or potential employees. We can fix this, and we should be able to muster bipartisan support to do so.If you're a working parent, you know thereís hardly ever enough time at home to be with the kids. Too many parents have to weigh whether they can afford to miss work even for half a day to see their child off on the first day of school or attend a parent-teacher conference.†Federal laws dating back to the 1930s make it harder for parents who hold hourly jobs to balance the demands of work and home. An hourly employee cannot convert previous overtime into future comp-time or flex-time. In 1985, Congress passed a law that gave state and municipal employees this flexibility, but today still denies that same privilege to the entire private sector. Thatís not right.Thereís a police officer at home in my district, her name is Vicki. She is working a tough job, with long hours, while raising her children. Her life is made a little easier because as a local government employee, she is permitted to work some extra hours and save it up for a sick day or a school event.Imagine if we simply chose to give all employees and employers this option. A working mom could work overtime this month and use it as time off next month without having to worry about whether she'll be able to take home enough money to pay the rent. This is the kind of common sense legislation that should be non-controversial and moves us in the right direction to help make life work for families.†Another step we have to take is on taxes. There is a lot of talk about taxes in Washington right now. For most families, tax preparation is hard and it is time consuming ñ this time of year especially. Think about what theyíre going through.†What tax form are you supposed to fill out, is it more beneficial to file jointly as a married couple or separately? Is a truck or gas mileage deductible or are you forgetting something that the IRS gives you credit for?†In 1935, the Form 1040 was accompanied by a two-page instruction booklet. Today, taxpayers must wade through over 100 total pages of instructions. Just filling out a W-4 at a new job is confusing. You shouldnít need a worksheet to know how many dependents you have. Chairman Dave Camp and his committee are already underway in the effort to responsibly rewrite our nation's tax laws.As in education policy, health care and all else, tax reform, should reflect the priorities of working families and the future they're trying to shape for their kids. If nothing else, we must stop putting special interests ahead of our working familiesí best interests.Loopholes and gimmicks benefitting those who've come to know how to work the system in Washington, are no more defensible than the path of wasteful and irresponsible spending we've been on for decades. Working families should come first. Everyone agrees a fairer, simpler tax code would give us all more time.†In our attempt to make the tax code simpler, we must continue to demonstrate support for young parents who invest in having kids and raising a family. They are America's most valued investors.†In 1997, a Republican Congress created the child tax credit specifically to help ease the financial burden of families raising children. In 2001, it was expanded. Such a policy helps to limit the size of government and results in fewer Americans looking to the government for support.†Leading up to April 15th, families will be besieged by concerns over their taxes. But itís health care and a concern for a healthy family that always worry parents most. Most Americans have come to expect the best health care in the world. But thereís no doubt our current system is too expensive and too complicated.†President Obamaís health care law resulted in higher premiums and costs for families, and has made access to quality health care and innovation tougher. If we want to reverse this trend, we should start by choosing to repeal the new taxes that are increasing the costs of health care and health insurance, like the medical device tax.†With us today is Erin Shucosky. Erin has been a clinical nurse for 30 years in Baltimore. She spent the past ten years coordinating the research on a study to approve new replacement discs to treat patients suffering from crippling neck and back pain. Over time, Erin discovered she suffered from the very condition her work aimed to treat. On her days off, Erin would spend time at her daughterís lacrosse tournaments barely able to move, and would then go home and spend most of her time there with an ice pack on her neck. So she went in for surgery and got those new disc replacements. Erinís in a cervical collar today, but thankfully sheís on the mend.†The new medical device tax in ObamaCare makes it harder for researchers to develop these innovative devices in the U.S. and thus makes it harder for patients like Erin to get the care they need.†ObamaCare has unnecessarily raised the costs of our health care. Even those who have pre-existing conditions could get the coverage they need without a trillion dollar government program costing us all more. And thatís only the tip of the iceberg when we talk about health care reform.Many families, like mine, are dealing with the challenges presented by aging and very sick parents. They rely on Medicare for relief. In 1965 the federal government created Medicare modeled after the standard Blue-Cross Blue Shield insurance plan commonly available at that time. In the past 50 years both health care and health insurance have changed dramatically, but the government and Medicare have not kept pace.†Medicaid isnít doing any better. Under the Medicaid system the rules are set in Washington, but much of the bills are paid in our state capitals. Collectively states are spending more on Medicaid than they do on K-12 education. And states donít have the flexibility to innovate in order to lower costs and provide better care.As a result, in many cases, patients have been swallowed up by the system, and have become an afterthought. These programs are broken, and many patients are going without proper care. That's not fair to the people who depend on these programs. Weíve got to fix them.We can modernize Medicare so it isnít so complicated for seniors or health care providers and make it easier for them to get the care they need in a cost effective manner. We should begin by ending the arbitrary division between Part A, the hospital program, and Part B, the doctor services. We can create reasonable and predictable levels of out-of-pocket expenses without forcing seniors to rely on Medigap plans.†Seniors who choose to receive their health care treatment through a group of doctors and hospitals working together to control costs, should share in the savings through lower Medicare premiums and out of pocket costs. This is both cost effective and good for seniors.We can provide states more flexibility with respect to Medicaid that will allow them to provide better care for low-income families in a way that ultimately lowers costs. Options for states should include streamlining the process for determining eligibility, and allowing them to offer health coverage through patient-directed health care or flexible benefit programs. And we must make it faster and simpler for states to gain approval of federal waivers to modify their Medicaid programs.Long term, controlling health care costs will require smarter federal investments in medical research. Many of todayís cures and life saving treatments are a result of an initial federal investment. And much of it is spent on cancer research and other grave illnesses.†One of the most courageous people I know is a young girl from Richmond named Katie. Iíve known Katie for many years. Katie was diagnosed with a brain tumor just after her first birthday. This is every parentís worst nightmare. For years, she went through different treatments and therapies with little success. At age 7, she and her parents headed to St. Jude Childrenís Hospital in Memphis. She had a positive radiation treatment and is doing well today, but this month she will again travel back to St. Jude as she often does.Katie became a part of my congressional officeís family and even interned with us. We rooted for her, and prayed for her. Today, she is a bright 12-year-old that is making her own life work despite ongoing challenges. Katie is down here in the front row. Katie, thank you for being here with us.†Prayers for Katieís recovery help. But we also must pray that scientists and researchers find cures to these diseases so our parents and grandparents donít leave us too soon, or that children like Katie are not robbed of a healthy life.†There is an appropriate and necessary role for the federal government to ensure funding for basic medical research. Doing all we can to facilitate medical breakthroughs for people like Katie should be a priority. We can and must do better.†This includes cutting unnecessary red tape in order to speed up the availability of life saving drugs and treatments and reprioritizing existing federal research spending. Funds currently spent by the government on social science ñ including on politics of all things ñ would be better spent helping find cures to diseases.Scientific breakthroughs are the result of and have helped contribute to America's being the worldís capital of innovation and opportunity in nearly every field. For this and many other reasons, people across the globe want to become a part of our country. We must never diminish that desire, or worse, become a place that is no longer desirable.†It's no secret that there are more than 11 million people here illegally, many of whom have become part of the fabric of our country. They, like us, have families and dreams.While we are a nation that allows anyone to start anew, we are also a nation of laws, and thatís what makes tackling the issue of immigration reform so difficult. In looking to solve this problem soon, we must balance respect for the rule of law and respect for those waiting to enter this country legally, with care for the people and families, most of whom just want to make a better life, and contribute to America.A good place to start is with the kids. One of the great founding principles of our country was that children would not be punished for the mistakes of their parents. It is time to provide an opportunity for legal residence and citizenship for those who were brought to this country as children and who know no other home.Iím pleased that many of my colleagues in both chambers of Congress on both sides of the aisle have begun work in good faith to address these issues. And Iím pleased these discussions make border security, employment verification and creating a workable guest worker program an immediate priority. Itís the right thing to do for our families, for our security, and for our economy.There are some who would rather avoid fixing the problem in order to save this as a political issue. I reject this notion and call on the President to help lead us towards a bipartisan solution rather than encourage the common political divisions of the past.A sonnet by Emma Lazarus, ìThe New Colossus,î was placed at the Statue of Liberty in 1903. Parts of it read: ìHere at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand A mighty woman with a torchÖFrom her beacon-hand Glows world-wide welcomeÖI lift my lamp beside the golden door!îThe message of this sonnet should sound familiar to most of us. The image of the Statue of Liberty blended with the stories of our immigrant past serve as humble reminders of who we are as a country. It's the reason I'm able to stand here before you.†Like so many of their generation living in Eastern Europe at the turn of the last century, my grandparents fled the vicious anti-Semitic programs of the czars of Russia to come to America. Widowed at a young age, my grandmother raised her two sons in a tiny apartment atop a grocery store she and my grandfather had opened.†With little but her faith, thrift and hope for a better tomorrow, my grandma worked seven days a week to ensure my dad and uncle could realize the promise of this great country. And today, my children and I stand as proof of the possibility to what may have seemed to her like an impossible dream.†To uphold this legacy of those whoíve come before us, Washington will need to make choices. And in a divided government, these choices are often tough. We in the House Majority remain committed to making those tough choices and stand ready to lead with this president.†"Higher" ñ Milton Wright once shouted from the air. ìHigher.î Making life work for more working people, and all who want to work, is the best way to a future of higher growth and more opportunity.Thank You.
Nobel prize-winning economist Paul Krugman stopped by our studio recently to share his views on a number of critical topics--including the deficit. Krugman is not saying that "deficits don't matter." What he is saying is that our current deficit just is not a critical issue and does not need to be addressed right now. Watch below. Produced by Business Insider Video
APPresident Barack Obama urged Congress today to avoid the looming across-the-board cuts set to kick in March 1 as a result of the sequester, saying they will be damaging to potential economic growth in 2013. "Our economy is headed in the right direction. And it will stay that way as long as there are no self-inflicted wounds," he said. The latest wound identified by Obama was the sequester, whose cuts are†expected to amount to $1.2 trillion over 10 years ó including $85.3 billion in fiscal year 2013 alone. House Republicans have pledged a willingness to let the sequester take effect, though they would prefer to allocate the array of spending cuts differently. Obama said that the economy is poised for success this year,†but that the uncertainty from the "effects that political dysfunction can have" threatened to hold back any steps forward. He said that if Congress can't come to a broad budget agreement by March 1, it should delay the sequester by a few months to avoid the harmful consequences. "If Congress can't act immediately on a bigger package by the time the sequester is set to go into effect," they should delay the "damaging effects" of the sequester, Obama said.† Obama called for a "balanced mix" of spending cuts and tax reform. He emphasized ó twice ó that the proposals put forward during negotiations with House Speaker John Boehner on the fiscal cliff "are still very much on the table." He repeated, for emphasis, that they were "on the table." Those proposals included some cuts to Social Security. In a statement earlier on Tuesday, Boehner flatly rejected an assertion that new revenue would be part of a deal to avert the sequester. ìPresident Obama first proposed the sequester and insisted it become law," Boehner said in a statement provided by his office. "Republicans have twice voted to replace these arbitrary cuts with common-sense cuts and reforms that protect our national defense. We believe there is a better way to reduce the deficit, but Americans do not support sacrificing real spending cuts for more tax hikes. The Presidentís sequester should be replaced with spending cuts and reforms that will start us on the path to balancing the budget in 10 years."
Goldman Sachs economist Jim O'Neill is retiring. Just over ten years ago, O'Neill introduced the world to the BRICs in a paper titled Building Better Global Economic BRICs. In that paper, which came out in 2001, he said that Brazil, Russia, India, and China would become hugely important economically and financially. And he was dead on. Here's the statement from Goldman's Lloyd Blankfein and Gary Cohn: After nearly 20 years of outstanding service, Jim O'Neill, chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, has decided to retire from the firm later this year. Jim is an influential economist and thought leader, and is regarded as an expert in the worldís foreign exchange and bond markets. Importantly, he has identified revolutionary economic trends, defining the concept of the BRICs which has become synonymous with the emergence of Brazil, Russia, India and China as growth opportunities of the future. Jimís BRIC thesis has challenged conventional thinking about emerging markets and, as a result, has had a significant economic and social impact. More recently, his book, The Growth Map, captured his perspectives on the growth markets of today and the future. Jim joined Goldman Sachs in 1995 as a partner in the roles of co-head of Global Economics Research and chief currency economist. He was named head of Global Economics, Commodities and Strategy Research in 2001. In 2006, Jim joined the firmís European Management Committee. In 2010, he took up his current role as chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, and since then he has strengthened our research discipline and enhanced communication among investment professionals across asset classes. In each of his roles at the firm, Jim has served our clients by formulating views on global economic and market themes and helping them to be positioned for the most significant investment opportunities. Jim is involved in a number of non-profit organizations. He is chairman and a founding trustee of the London-based charity SHINE and also serves on the board of Teach for All and a number of other charities specializing in education. Jim has been the recipient of many awards, including an honorary doctorate in 2009 from the Institute of Education, University of London, for his educational philanthropy. He is also a member of the board of the Itinera Institute and has been on the board of Bruegel since its creation. Jim is a member of the UK-India Round Table and the UK India Business Council, and is also chairman of the Greater Manchester Local Enterprise Partnership Advisory. He previously served as a non-executive director of Manchester United before it returned to private ownership in 2005. We wish Jim and his family all the best in the years ahead. Lloyd C.

CBOThe CBO has just published its Budget and Economic Outlook. The big headline: the CBO expects the U.S. budget deficit to fall to $845 billion this year.¬† This would be the first reading under $1 trillion in five years. They also estimate that the deficit falls to $616 billion in 2014 and as low as $430 billion in 2015. They assume unemployment rates of 8.0 percent in 2013 and 7.6 percent in 2014.¬† They also assume GDP growth of 1.4 percent in 2013 accelerating to 3.4 percent in 2014. Here are the CBO's long-term budget projections: CBO And here are the economic projections: CBO Download the full report here. Below is the CBO's statement:======================== Economic growth will remain slow this year, CBO anticipates, as gradual improvement in many of the forces that drive the economy is offset by the effects of budgetary changes that are scheduled to occur under current law. After this year, economic growth will speed up, CBO projects, causing the unemployment rate to decline and inflation and interest rates to eventually rise from their current low levels. Nevertheless, the unemployment rate is expected to remain above 7¬Ω percent through next year; if that happens, 2014 will be the sixth consecutive year with unemployment exceeding 7¬Ω percent of the labor force‚Äîthe longest such period in the past 70 years. If the current laws that govern federal taxes and spending do not change, the budget deficit will shrink this year to $845 billion, or 5.3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), its smallest size since 2008. In CBO‚Äôs baseline projections, deficits continue to shrink over the next few years, falling to 2.4 percent of GDP by 2015. Deficits are projected to increase later in the coming decade, however, because of the pressures of an aging population, rising health care costs, an expansion of federal subsidies for health insurance, and growing interest payments on federal debt. As a result, federal debt held by the public is projected to remain historically high relative to the size of the economy for the next decade. By 2023, if current laws remain in place, debt will equal 77 percent of GDP and be on an upward path, CBO projects (see figure below).  Such high and rising debt would have serious negative consequences: When interest rates rose to more normal levels, federal spending on interest payments would increase substantially. Moreover, because federal borrowing reduces national saving, the capital stock would be smaller and total wages would be lower than they would be if the debt was reduced. In addition, lawmakers would have less flexibility than they might ordinarily to use tax and spending policies to respond to unexpected challenges. Finally, such a large debt would increase the risk of a fiscal crisis, during which investors would lose so much confidence in the government‚Äôs ability to manage its budget that the government would be unable to borrow at affordable rates. The federal budget deficit, which shrank as a percentage of GDP for the third year in a row in 2012, will fall again in 2013, if current laws remain the same. At an estimated $845 billion, the 2013 imbalance would be the first deficit in five years below $1 trillion; and at 5.3 percent of GDP, it would be only about half as large, relative to the size of the economy, as the deficit was in 2009. Nevertheless, if the laws that govern taxes and spending do not change, federal debt held by the public will reach 76 percent of GDP by the end of this fiscal year, the largest percentage since 1950. With revenues expected to rise more rapidly than spending in the next few years under current law, the deficit is projected to dip as low as 2.4 percent of GDP by 2015. In later years, however, projected deficits rise steadily, reaching almost 4 percent of GDP in 2023. For the 2014‚Äì2023 period, deficits in CBO‚Äôs baseline projections total $7.0 trillion. With such deficits, federal debt would remain above 73 percent of GDP‚Äîfar higher than the 39 percent average seen over the past four decades. (As recently as the end of 2007, federal debt equaled just 36 percent of GDP.) Moreover, debt would be increasing relative to the size of the economy in the second half of the decade. Those projections are not CBO‚Äôs predictions of future outcomes. As specified in law, CBO‚Äôs baseline projections are constructed under the assumption that current laws generally remain unchanged, so that they can serve as a benchmark against which potential changes in law can be measured. Federal revenues will increase by roughly 25 percent between 2013 and 2015 under current law, CBO projects. That increase is expected to result from a rise in income because of the growing economy, from policy changes that are scheduled to take effect during that period, and from policy changes that have already taken effect but whose full impact on revenues will not be felt until after this year (such as the recent increase in tax rates on income above certain thresholds). As a result of those factors, revenues are projected to grow from 15.8 percent of GDP in 2012 to 19.1 percent of GDP in 2015‚Äîcompared with an average of 17.9 percent of GDP over the past 40 years. Under current law, revenues will remain at roughly 19 percent of GDP from 2015 through 2023, CBO estimates. In CBO‚Äôs baseline projections, federal spending rises over the next few years in dollar terms but falls relative to the size of the economy. During those years, the growth of spending will be restrained both by the strengthening economy (as spending for programs such as unemployment compensation drops) and by provisions of the Budget Control Act of 2011 (Public Law 112-25). Although outlays are projected to decline from 22.8 percent of GDP in 2012 to 21.5 percent by 2017, they will still exceed their 40-year average of 21.0 percent. (Outlays peaked at 25.2 percent of GDP in 2009 but have fallen relative to GDP in the past few years.) After 2017, if current laws remain in place, outlays will start growing again as a percentage of GDP. The aging of the population, increasing health care costs, and a significant expansion of eligibility for federal subsidies for health insurance will substantially boost spending for Social Security and for major health care programs relative to the size of the economy. At the same time, rising interest rates will significantly increase the government‚Äôs debt-service costs. In CBO‚Äôs baseline, outlays reach about 23 percent of GDP in 2023 and are on an upward trajectory. The deficits projected in CBO‚Äôs current baseline are significantly larger than the ones in CBO‚Äôs baseline of August 2012. At that time, CBO projected deficits totaling $2.3 trillion for the 2013‚Äì2022 period; in the current baseline, the total deficit for that period has risen by $4.6 trillion. That increase stems chiefly from the enactment of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (P.L. 112-240), which made changes to tax and spending laws that will boost deficits by a total of $4.0 trillion (excluding debt-service costs) between 2013 and 2022, according to estimates by CBO and the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation. CBO‚Äôs updated baseline also takes into account other legislative actions since August, as well as a new economic forecast and some technical revisions to its projections. Current law leaves many key budget issues unresolved, and this year, lawmakers will face three significant budgetary deadlines: Budgetary outcomes will also be affected by decisions about whether to continue certain policies that have been in effect in recent years. Such policies could be continued, for example, by extending some tax provisions that are scheduled to expire (and that have routinely been extended in the past) or by preventing the 25 percent cut in Medicare‚Äôs payment rates for physicians that is due to occur in 2014. If, for instance, lawmakers eliminated the automatic spending cuts scheduled to take effect in March (but left in place the original caps on discretionary funding set by the Budget Control Act), prevented the sharp reduction in Medicare‚Äôs payment rates for physicians, and extended the tax provisions that are scheduled to expire at the end of calendar year 2013 (or, in some cases, in later years), budget deficits would be substantially larger over the coming decade than in CBO‚Äôs baseline projections. With those changes, and no offsetting reductions in deficits, debt held by the public would rise to 87 percent of GDP by the end of 2023 rather than to 77 percent. In addition to those decisions, lawmakers will continue to face the longer-term budgetary issues posed by the substantial federal debt and by the implications of rising health care costs and the aging of the population. The U.S. economy expanded modestly in calendar year 2012, continuing the slow recovery seen since the recession ended in mid-2009. Although economic growth is expected to remain slow again this year, CBO anticipates that underlying factors in the economy will spur a more rapid expansion beginning next year. Even so, under the fiscal policies embodied in current law, output is expected to remain below its potential (or maximum sustainable) level until 2017 (see figure below). By CBO‚Äôs estimates, in the fourth quarter of 2012, real (inflation-adjusted) GDP was about 5¬Ω percent below its potential level. That gap was only modestly smaller than the gap between actual and potential GDP that existed at the end of the recession because the growth of output since then has been only slightly greater than the growth of potential output. With such a large gap between actual and potential GDP persisting for so long, CBO projects that the total loss of output, relative to the economy‚Äôs potential, between 2007 and 2017 will be equivalent to nearly half of the output that the United States produced last year.  CBO expects that economic activity will expand slowly this year, with real GDP growing by just 1.4 percent. That slow growth reflects a combination of ongoing improvement in underlying economic factors and fiscal tightening that has already begun or is scheduled to occur‚Äîincluding the expiration of a 2 percentage-point cut in the Social Security payroll tax, an increase in tax rates on income above certain thresholds, and scheduled automatic reductions in federal spending. That subdued economic growth will limit businesses‚Äô need to hire additional workers, thereby causing the unemployment rate to stay near 8 percent this year, CBO projects. The rate of inflation and interest rates are projected to remain low. After the economy adjusts this year to the fiscal tightening inherent in current law, underlying economic factors will lead to more rapid growth, CBO projects‚Äî3.4 percent in 2014 and an average of 3.6 percent a year from 2015 through 2018. In particular, CBO expects that the effects of the housing and financial crisis will continue to fade and that an upswing in housing construction (though from a very low level), rising real estate and stock prices, and increasing availability of credit will help to spur a virtuous cycle of faster growth in employment, income, consumer spending, and business investment over the next few years. Nevertheless, under current law, CBO expects the unemployment rate to remain high‚Äîabove 7¬Ω percent through 2014‚Äîbefore falling to 5¬Ω percent at the end of 2017. The rate of inflation is projected to rise slowly after this year: CBO estimates that the annual increase in the price index for personal consumption expenditures will reach about 2 percent in 2015. The interest rate on 3 month Treasury bills‚Äîwhich has hovered near zero for the past several years‚Äîis expected to climb to 4 percent by the end of 2017, and the rate on 10-year Treasury notes is projected to rise from 2.1 percent in 2013 to 5.2 percent in 2017. For the second half of the coming decade, CBO does not attempt to predict the cyclical ups and downs of the economy; rather, CBO assumes that GDP will stay at its maximum sustainable level. On that basis, CBO projects that both actual and potential real GDP will grow at an average rate of 2¬º percent a year between 2019 and 2023. That pace is much slower than the average growth rate of potential GDP since 1950. The main reason is that the growth of the labor force will slow down because of the retirement of the baby boomers and an end to the long-standing increase in women‚Äôs participation in the labor force. CBO also projects that the unemployment rate will fall to 5.2 percent by 2023 and that inflation and interest rates will stay at about their 2018 levels throughout the 2019‚Äì2023 period.
The big rally in European risk assets like stocks took a breather late last week. Citi strategist Robert Crossley is watching flows in sovereign bond markets, and he warns that problems are surfacing in Europe. In a note to clients titled "Cracks starting to appear in Europe," Crossley looks at demand for European sovereign debt ‚Äì which just turned negative for the first time in three months. Although the drop in demand has been led by a retreat from safe-haven investments in "core" sovereign debt ‚Äì like that of Germany ‚Äì the issue is where the money has been going. Certain sovereign debt markets in the euro periphery ‚Äì Spain, for one ‚Äì have been the big winners. Demand for the periphery remains positive, notes Crossley, but that could change pretty quickly: Although demand for peripherals has fallen, like the core, it remains positive. It is this cumulative yield-seeking positioning that concerns us in the current environment where the risk-on mood is turning and investors are reassessing the risk-reward of risk positions with the wash-out of carry trades in short-dated EUR swap forwards, a strengthening FX rate, and risks surrounding comments coming from the forthcoming ECB meeting. Sure enough, there is one market in particular that has Citi particularly wary: Spanish sovereign debt. As the chart below shows, and as Crossley characterizes it, "buying has been disproportionately large in Spain" over the past month as investors have embraced the risk rally full-stop. Citi Research "That flow," Crossley writes, "makes us very wary of the potential for the current risk-off mood to gather damaging momentum." As Crossley hinted, much will turn on Draghi's response at Thursday's ECB press conference to any questions about the recent strength in the euro and the corresponding sell-off in short-term and safe-haven interest rate investments. Morgan Stanley interest rate strategist Laurence Mutkin agrees. He writes in a note to clients, "Our economists doubt [Draghi will] lean heavily against the rise in rates, but we hope he'll avoid the mistake his predecessor made in blithely characterizing the rise in EONIAs after the 1y LTROs‚Äô expiry in 2010 as being no more than evidence of the improving health of the banks."

Things are looking bad for Argentina's economy ‚Äî central bank reserves are at 2007 lows due to capital flight, inflation is heading up, and the IMF is ready to punish the country for manipulating economic statistics. This is not the time when, as a Minister of the Economy, you want to get caught coming back from vacation in Uruguay with your family. But that's just what happened to Vice Finance Minister Axel Kicillof, a young father, and his wife as they were taking the Buquebus shuttle home from beach spot Colonia del Sacramento in Uruguay, La Nacion reports. You can check the video out below courtesy of infobae.com. It's only about 6 minutes long but La Nacion reports that the heckling lasted for about a half an hour. If you don't speak Spanish, what the crowd is saying is a collection of... "Thief, thief, thief! (Ladron!)" and the chanting is "Caradura!", which doesn't have a direct translation in English but is what you call someone who has a lot of nerve ‚Äî in a bad, bad way. Things get really interesting around 5:00 when Kicillof carrying his son and with his wife (wearing stripes) boards the shuttle and the crowd gets closer to him and shouting louder. 
It turns out that the biggest financing market is not in corporate bonds or even mortgages. It's trade receivables. According to the Receivables Exchange, $11 trillion of trade receivables is originated by small and mid-size businesses and another $6 trillion by large corporations, for a whopping total market size of $17 trillion. As US money market funds are squeezed by new regulation, the types of commercial paper (CP) these funds can buy is limited to the top-rated corporations and banks. The smaller or lower rated firms have limited or no access to the CP markets. And banks sometimes have a limited appetite to finance corporate receivables on their balance sheets. By opening up receivables financing to end-users directly, the exchange effectively creates an alternative to CP or money markets for investors to park their cash. The receivables term tends to be quite short (typically under 2 months), but there is clearly credit risk associated with these transactions. Many of these firms are smaller and/or sub-investment-grade or unrated - so credit work needs to be done prior to investing. One way to mitigate the risk is by pooling these receivables (effectively disintermediating money market funds) to create diversification which is what the exchange allows investors to do (see presentation below).

‚ÄúAnyone who does not understand that the price of every stock and every bond is being artificially altered by the fact that interest rates are being manipulated by the Federal Reserve should not be risking any money in the markets.‚Äù‚ÄîMichael Lewitt, The Credit Strategist ‚ÄúWho is afraid of currency wars?‚Äù asks Gavyn Davies in the FT (see here). I have known Gavyn for 25 years and have to confess that he is way out of my league intellectually. He is one of the smartest people I have ever met and, thankfully, also one of the humblest. He rarely gets things wrong so, when I occasionally disagree with him, it always makes me slightly uneasy. In his latest post in the FT, he makes the valid point that the currency war debate has flared up yet again following newly elected Japanese Prime Minister Abe‚Äôs decision to change tact and openly bully his own central bank into action. Yet Gavyn ‚Äì and he is certainly not alone in that regard ‚Äì ignores one important aspect in his argumentation and that has to do with what actually drives exchange rates. Just because a currency is depreciating doesn‚Äôt mean it is subject to manipulation. A quick look at chart 1 makes it pretty clear that the recent weakening of the yen is just a tiny blip on the curve (a rising bar equals a weaker yen).  Over the past 52 weeks USD/JPY has moved from a low of about 76 to a shade below 93 today. Towards the end of the great equity bull market in the late 1990s USD/JPY was close to 150. 15 years earlier, at the beginning of the same bull market, one U.S. dollar would cost you over 250 yen. For political leaders all over the world to openly attack Japan now that the yen has given back just a tiny fraction of those massive gains of the previous three decades, is simply preposterous.  Before anyone accuses me of being hopelessly naive, let me make one thing very clear. I have no doubts whatsoever that, given the economic and fiscal predicament many governments find themselves in at the moment, currency manipulation (as in ‚Äúlet‚Äôs manage it down‚Äù) is on most political agendas. They probably all want to do it, but they can‚Äôt all succeed in doing it, at least not simultaneously. There is however an altogether different, yet poorly understood, reason why currencies may depreciate¬†over time (in the following I shall ignore all the trivial reasons why exchange rates move, such as interest rate and inflation differentials, etc.). Bloomberg, Business Insider ¬† It all begins with the outlook for bond yields which, if you believe various commentators, is extremely bleak. In fact, tracking down a bond bull these days is almost as hard as stumbling across snow clearing equipment anywhere near a UK airport on a snowy day. In truth, I cannot recall ever having encountered as much bearish sentiment when it comes to the outlook for bond prices, as I see in the markets today. The low yield environment, or so the argument goes, is bound to end in tears as the bond vigilantes eventually gain the upper hand and punish governments for their profligate spending. The question I will be asking in the following is: could this argument possibly be flawed?  Accounting identities matter  Now, let‚Äôs remind ourselves of a couple of general misconceptions. Firstly, the notion that foreigners can pull out of, say, UK assets just because they lose faith in UK economic policy is fundamentally flawed. National income accounting principles assure that net foreign capital inflows into the UK will always equal the UK current account deficit (the flow identity). For precisely the same reason, the total stock of UK assets held by foreigners must equal the sum of all past deficits (the stock identity). These two principles are accounting identities and will always be valid, whatever country you look at. So long as a country runs a current account deficit, foreigners will accumulate claims on it whether they wish to do so or not. Likewise, countries that run a surplus will accumulate claims identical to the size of the surplus.  The second mistake is the failure to recognise that when foreigners become disenchanted with Her Majesty‚Äôs Government, they can be ‚Äòappeased‚Äô either through higher bond yields or through reduced currency risk. In plain English, the bond market is not the only adjustment mechanism. Whilst we all sit and wait for bond prices to fall out of bed, the currency may in fact take the brunt of the adjustment.  Hence the question investors should really be asking themselves is under what circumstances will bond yields rise and under what circumstances will the currency weaken? This has little to do with currency wars and much more to do with an¬†economic theory developed by James Tobin (amongst others) back in the 1970s and 1980s. Let‚Äôs have a crack at it. How the theory works The first factor to consider is asset preferences. Let‚Äôs assume that foreign investors have become disenchanted with UK bond yields which they consider to be unattractively low. As a result, they wish to sell their UK gilts and invest the proceeds in UK equities instead (remember, they cannot ‚Äòexit‚Äô UK assets altogether due to the accounting identities discussed above). Assuming domestic investors‚Äô asset preferences remain unchanged, virtually all the adjustment will take place in the currency markets. The logic is straightforward. Since domestic investors‚Äô asset preferences are unchanged, the moment they observe falling bond prices and rising equity prices, they will take advantage of those price moves and reinstate what they consider to be the equilibrium between bond prices and equity prices. As a result, under the circumstances described above, the currency bears the brunt of any adjustment necessary to appease foreign investors. By the same token, should domestic and foreign investors become disenchanted at the same time, bond yields will rise whereas the currency will only be modestly affected.  Precisely the same argument can be put forward as far as inflation expectations are concerned. Should these change simultaneously for domestic and foreign investors, bond yields will rise. Should foreign investors change their inflation expectations for the worse whilst domestic investors remain more sanguine, the currency will take most if not all of the impact.  The third dynamic to consider is trade and hence the current account deficit. Assume for example that foreign investors‚Äô asset preferences have begun to affect the exchange rate. This may in turn have an effect on the trade deficit over time, as the weakening currency is likely to favourably impact the level of competitiveness. Then again, the more the trade deficit improves as a result of the weakening currency, the more bond yields may rise over time due to the law of supply and demand of funds. Why? Because the improving trade deficit leaves fewer pounds in the hands of foreigners to be invested in UK assets.  Finally, consider the savings rate. It may or may not change as a result of the above but let‚Äôs assume for argument‚Äôs sake that total domestic savings increase by an amount equal to the improvement in the trade deficit. If that were to happen, the supply/demand argument in the previous paragraph falls away, as the falling demand from foreign investors due to the improving trade deficit will be offset by increased demand from domestic investors due to the growth in savings. In this case, bond yields will be unaffected.  Could currencies soak up most of the pressure?  When Tobin put his ideas into economic theory, he had no reason to suspect that, in 2008, the world would very nearly be overwhelmed by the most dramatic economic crisis since the Great Depression. Nor could he foresee that, as a result of that crisis, a fifth dynamic would enter the frame, namely that of central bank policy.  Over the past few years monetary policy has become largely synonymous with asset price manipulation, mainly executed through regular bond market interventions. This has only reinforced my belief that, before this crisis is well and truly over, foreign exchange rates are more likely than bond yields to endure a period of extreme volatility, and any investor who positions himself for a major bear market in bonds may end up thoroughly disappointed. Chart 2 below illustrates very well that, despite¬†the recent weakening of the yen, currency volatility remains at very suppressed levels. This may be about to change. Bloomberg, Business Insider ¬† Consider the economic reality and the options available to policy makers. A mountain of debt so huge that it almost defies belief. Under normal circumstances, the best prescription for debt elimination is economic growth but, in the current environment, it will be next to impossible to engineer enough of it to solve the problem through growth alone.  The most effective tool at policy makers‚Äô disposal may be a ‚Äòcontrolled‚Äô rise in inflation (I use inverted commas because, once the inflation genie is out of the bottle, there is always a risk that policy makers lose control) combined with artificially suppressed bond yields, in effect setting the stage for negative real yields for a sustained period of time. Japan has already moved its inflation target to 2%. It won‚Äôt be long before the first central bank drops its inflation target altogether ‚Äì if not explicitly then implicitly ‚Äì and begins to prioritise growth over inflation.  Negative real rates (low funding costs on existing debt combined with modestly higher inflation) will do the job over time, as long as investors are cognisant of the fact that ‚Äòover time‚Äô means many years. There are no easy solutions.  Recapitalising the banks  The added advantage of this strategy is that the banking system will be able to recapitalise itself without the use of tax payers‚Äô money. Well, not entirely correct. There is no explicit use of tax payers‚Äô money in this model; however, zero rate interest policy is enormously damaging to all those people who rely on their savings to take them through retirement, but that is a story for another day.  The recapitalisation of the banking sector has been made possible through an undertaking that central banks will keep policy rates low for an extended period of time. This permits banks to engage in a virtually risk-free carry trade by borrowing at the short end of the curve and investing at the long end ‚Äì levered up many times. No appetite for ‚Äònuclear‚Äô options  So, in summary, expect various measures of economic stimulus, expect the bond market to be manipulated through regular interventions and expect inflation to drift higher. I believe that will be the core ingredients of economic policy for years to come. It is a high risk strategy. Not only may the inflation genie be let out; it is also a strategy that encourages reckless investor behaviour and thus repeated asset price bubbles, but what are the alternatives? The Austrian school of economics advocates wholesale bank closures and other ‚Äònuclear‚Äô solutions, but I see no political appetite for such drastic methods.  This leads me to make the first two predictions of 2013:  (i) ¬†public spending, and thus government deficits, will stay high for much longer than generally perceived, and  (ii) ¬†the combination of monetary and fiscal policy currently being pursued in the U.S., Europe and Japan, is likely to lead to big changes in exchange rates over the next few years.  This begs the question: Since not all currencies can simultaneously depreciate in value, which ones are likely to appreciate and which ones will most likely depreciate?  Let‚Äôs do a little detour by reviewing how the world‚Äôs major currencies have actually performed over the past twelve months. Charts 3 a-d, which I have borrowed courtesy of Zero Hedge, provide a graphic illustration of the performance of each of the four currencies (you can see the whole study here).  If the chart is predominantly green, the currency being reviewed has depreciated in value against most other currencies in the world over the past twelve months. On the other hand, if it is mostly red, the currency has been strong over the past year. Now look at the four charts.  The charts pretty much speak for themselves. The yen has weakened against all other currencies, explaining the coordinated attack on Abe and his much trumpeted Abenomics. Meanwhile, to the horror of the political leadership in Europe, the euro has defied all logic and outpaced all other major currencies over the past year. This is really the last thing Europe needs with almost half of the eurozone countries in dire economic trouble, again explaining why leading European politicians such as German finance minister Wolfgang SchaÃàuble have been particularly outspoken. The Absolute Return Letter The Absolute Return Letter The Absolute Return Letter The Absolute Return Letter ¬† Conclusion  Now to the $64 million question: Knowing that not all currencies can depreciate, which ones are likely to fall from here and which ones should gain in value?  The easy one first. Acknowledging the fact that most Asian currencies are artificially low (a point I have made repeatedly in the past), over time, I would expect Asian currencies in general to gradually appreciate in value against all four currencies in our analysis, i.e. USD, GBP, EUR and JPY. As the economic crisis deepens, and it will, those four currency blocks will be prepared to use increasingly desperate measures to stop the systematic manipulation of exchange rates happening across Asia. Eventually, they will succeed.  As far as the four currencies in our analysis are concerned, I strongly suspect that JPY will prove the weakest link. There are at least a couple of reasons for that. The fiscal problems in Japan are well documented and shall need no further substantiation other than to say that the weaker the fiscal outlook - and it is extraordinarily weak in Japan ‚Äì the higher risk premium bond investors should demand, all other things being equal.  However, the situation in Japan cannot be directly compared to that of Europe and the U.S.; Japan has been running a sizeable current account surplus for decades and, as a result, does not have to rely on foreign investors to finance its deficit as the U.S. and many countries in Europe do. Japan‚Äôs current account may be about to take a turn for the worse, but let‚Äôs not confuse ‚Äòstocks‚Äô with ‚Äòflows‚Äô. Japan still enjoys the second largest foreign exchange reserves in the world (behind China) and will not have to rely on foreigners to finance its deficit for some time to come.  This obviously assumes that domestic investors continue to support the bond market. In that context I note that Japanese banks have effectively taken control of the Japanese bond market with more than 40% of all JGBs now in their hands, and with the combined holdings equal to 9 times their tier one capital (chart 4). You can argue that this is a disaster waiting to happen. On the other hand, you can also argue that the banks simply cannot afford not to continue their support of the Japanese bond market. Anything else would be suicidal. The Absolute Return Letter ¬† Going back to the original discussion, this leads me to conclude that, as long as asset preferences of Japanese investors remain unchanged, the exchange rate more so than the bond market should take the brunt of the adjustment that is likely to come¬† Japan‚Äôs way. I would not be at all surprised to see USD/JPY at 120-130 a few years from now.  This is very bullish for Japanese exporters and is the key reason we have recently increased the allocation to Japanese equities in our clients‚Äô portfolios. Meanwhile the currency risk has been hedged in order not to give all the gains away again.  The other extreme to me is the U.S. dollar which I see as potentially the strongest of the four. USD is a very ‚Äòpolitical‚Äô currency, partly because it is the world‚Äôs primary reserve currency and partly because so many other currencies around the world are linked to it, whether directly or indirectly. Given all the economic problems facing Japan and countries all over Europe, a substantial depreciation in the value of the greenback would be completely unacceptable.  All of which leaves the two major European currencies ‚Äì EUR and GBP. Being a much smaller currency, of the two, sterling is the easier one to manipulate. If you add to that the fact that the UK gilt markets are heavily dominated by UK pension funds who are captive investors, the chances are that the adjustment process in the UK will take place primarily through the currency markets which implies that EUR may very well outperform GBP over time, but it is not a straightforward call.

GettyPresident Barack Obama will formally ask Congress today to avoid the looming across-the-board spending cuts of the sequester set to start kicking in March 1, The White House said this morning. Obama will make a statement at the White House at 1:15 p.m. today, urging Congress to avoid the sequester with a short-term plan that involves "tens of billions" of dollars in spending cuts and tax revenue. The cuts of the sequester are¬†expected to amount to $1.2 trillion over 10 years ‚Äî including $85.3 billion in fiscal year 2013 alone. Last week, the White House slammed the possible implementation of the cuts ‚Äî which House Republicans have become more willing to do lately ‚Äî as "bad policy." "The fact is the sequester was designed ‚Äî defense cuts, nondefense cuts, half and half; both of them onerous, both of them¬†bad¬†policy¬†‚Äî specifically to compel Congress to avoid the implementation of the sequester by doing the responsible thing and coming up with $1.2 trillion in additional deficit reduction in a balanced and appropriate way," White House press secretary Jay Carney said last week. Boehner immediately pushed back at reports that the President would look for new revenue in a deal to avert the sequester. ‚ÄúPresident Obama first proposed the sequester and insisted it become law," Boehner said in a statement provided by his office. "Republicans have twice voted to replace these arbitrary cuts with common-sense cuts and reforms that protect our national defense. We believe there is a better way to reduce the deficit, but Americans do not support sacrificing real spending cuts for more tax hikes. The President‚Äôs sequester should be replaced with spending cuts and reforms that will start us on the path to balancing the budget in 10 years." An aide to House Speaker John Boehner slammed Obama's planned statement on Twitter: Don't look now, America, but your president is proposing yet another "short-term fix" for the economy and the spending problem. The White House has frequently said that it doesn't want the cuts. At a presidential debate in October, President Barack Obama firmly¬†declared that sequestration "would not happen."¬† Sequestration would force the Pentagon to slash spending 16.3 percent across the board in fiscal year 2013 alone. Last week, a surprising GDP report that showed the economy shrinking for the first time in three years blamed a 22 percent reduction in military spending.

Late last night the Department of Justice filed a case against rating agency Standard and Poor's for allegedly defrauding investors by knowingly giving toxic mortgage backed securities positive ratings. You can check out highlights from the complaint (including an S&amp;P parody of The Talking Heads' 'Burning Down the House' here). The government poured over 20 million S&amp;P e-mails and instant message conversations to construct this case, and it's attorney Floyd Abrams, of Cahill Gordon &amp; Reindel who will have to answer for all of them in the company's defense. He started (publicly) this morning on CNBC. Abrams' argument against the government's case is simple ‚Äî S&amp;P did not knowingly deceive investors because they actually believed their ratings. "...the ratings that were issued were believed by the people that issued them," he told CNBC's David Faber. "The government has to show that S&amp;P literally disbelieved their ratings." Abrams went on to say that it wasn't just S&amp;P that believed the housing market was solid, other ratings agencies did too (after all, two had to agree on a product's rating for that rating to stick). Not only that, but the Federal Reserve and then-Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson were bullish on housing as well, Abrams explained. From CNBC: "The government read 20 million pages of e-mails and you the see best they could call out of it... an organization trying to come up with answers when answers were hard to come by." Faber asked Abrams if the U.S. government may be going after S&amp;P (and not other ratings agencies like Moody's), because of S&amp;P's downgrade of the U.S. government's bonds. It's a sinister idea, and Abrams didn't buy it... completely. "Is it true that after the down-grade the intensity of this investigation increased? Yeah, but we don't know why... certainly no on in government has come to me and said it." Pretty interesting stuff. If you're waiting for the trial, though, it'll be years away. In the meantime, Abrams will be trying to keep this case out of Court at all. Watch the full video below: 
As we all know, the Groundhog Day tradition holds that when a groundhog emerges from its burrow on February 2, if the groundhog sees its shadow the cold winter weather will continue for six more weeks. If not, spring will come early. This Groundhog Day, when looking at the Dow Jones Industrial Average (Dow), we are seeing shadows of what took place in each of the past three years as a new milestone was reached. As a result, the current levels on the index may linger for six or more months. The Dow closed at 14,000 on Friday for the first time since October 2007. For each of these round numbers (11,000, 12,000, and 13,000) the Dow has crossed in the past few years, it has taken the better part of a year for the market to break free of a period of ups and downs after reaching the milestone before beginning to move toward the next one. LPL FinancialFigure 1 If this pattern of the past few years, seen in Figure 1, repeats in 2013, now that we have crossed the 14,000 milestone in early February, the Dow may remain around that level nearly all year and not break free above that level until December again this year. Milestones Why might the Dow soon take a break after reaching 14,000 on Friday? These are fundamental reasons why a pause may be in store. But there is also a psychological reason why it tends to take some time to move beyond market milestones that are especially true this time. This milestone has extra significance, since Dow 14,000 marks a return to the stock market peak reached in October 2007, and lies just 1% below the all-time high of 14,164.53 on October 9, 2007. On that same day, the S&amp;P 500 index‚Äîa broader measure of the stock market than the Dow‚Äîreached 1,565.15. The S&amp;P 500 recently breached the 1500 milestone and has seen that milestone two times before, in October 2007 and March 2000; both times marked the ceiling for the stock market and the beginning of long and steep declines. As the stock market again nears the level that has defined the ceiling for the stock market during the past 13 years, market participants may show signs of caution. The Bull Is Not Dead The bull market is not likely to be over; if so, stocks would be ending a bull market with the S&amp;P 500 priced at the lowest multiple of earnings at a bull market peak since WWII [Figure 2]. However, a pause with some ups and downs around the recently reached milestone may be in store. The dips may make for attractive buying opportunities for investors who have been underinvested in stocks in recent years relative to their long-term target allocation. LPL FinancialFigure 2 These days, when someone refers to Groundhog Day, it is more likely they are referring to the classic Bill Murray movie where he is stuck in time and forced to repeat the same day over and over again‚Äîuntil eventually being able to move beyond it. This past weekend, ‚ÄúPunxsutawney Phil,‚Äù the world‚Äôs most well-known groundhog, saw his shadow and predicted more of the same winter weather in the weeks ahead. As Bill Murray‚Äôs character, Phil, said: ‚ÄúThis is one time where television really fails to capture the true excitement of a large squirrel predicting the weather.‚Äù It may be that we repeat the pattern of the past few years and wake up each day to a stock market stuck right around 14,000 for a while before we can move beyond it.
This has been an occasional theme for us, but after some conversations last week, think it warrants a deeper look. The various parties interacting in the market have become more correlated and the relationships more intricate. The growing use of ETFs by institutions is a key part of that self-reinforcing feedback loop. A now regular occurrence is a bond trader gets ‚Äúlifted‚Äù in the morning or sells bonds and is left short. That trader waits all day hoping to find a seller of those bonds. At the end of the day, rather than lifting an ‚Äúegregious‚Äù offer, or going home short, they will buy some ETFs to cover the market risk. Of course the next morning, everyone sees the spike in the ETF and views it as a sign that the market got really strong into the close, so they try to buy more bonds. This behavior first became noticeable in the credit markets with the creation of CDS indices but is now occurring with more frequency in the ETF space. The ‚Äúarbitrage‚Äù community also plays a role in these loops, especially when quoted bond ‚Äúprices‚Äù don‚Äôt reflect the reality of where the bonds would trade. To understand how the feedback loop can create problems, particularly in a down market, it is worth going back to seeing how credit traded in the ‚Äúold days‚Äù like 2007. Bond Sell-Offs in the ‚ÄúOld Days‚Äù Joey, the trader at a big market maker sends out a run on ShmoGo bonds. It is early in the morning, nothing much going on, futures a bit lower, but nothing that made the trader put much effort into the generic bond run. A client sees the run, and wants to sell. They call the trader directly, asking him to refresh the ShmoGo 7‚Äôs. Joey immediately guesses the client is a seller, so rather than ‚Äúrepeating‚Äù the 99.5/100.5 market from the run, quotes the bonds 99/100. The client is a bit annoyed as he clearly hoped to sell at 99.5. The client that proceeds to explain that everyone and he means ‚Äúeveryone‚Äù is 99.25 bid, won‚Äôt the trader take a couple at 99.25 to save him from having to call around? By this time, the customer‚Äôs salesperson has gotten involved and clearly thinks this is generous of the client, since the trader just flaked on the price and pushes the trader. Now feeling trapped and getting sucked into buying bonds he doesn‚Äôt want, the trader protests a little, asking what the client is doing with their overall position. The trader knows the client has a big block of these bonds and is legitimately concerned that if the client is exiting, then this purchase of a couple million will end very badly. The client insists they are just ‚Äútrimming‚Äù the name. ShmoGo‚Äôs are a core part of our strategy, we still love the name, but are just lightening up to cut back from an aggressive overweight to a more normal position. At this stage, trader finally accepts and buys $2 million ShmoGo 7‚Äôs at 99.25. By this time, it‚Äôs off to the morning meeting. The trader brings up the ‚Äúaxe‚Äù of having to move some ShmoGo 7‚Äôs at 100. They spend a half hour going through axes that are unlikely to be filled and listening to a couple research people drone on about some other company that looks cheap and another that is lucky not to be filing tomorrow. Meanwhile, finally back on the desk, having missed some weak economic data at 8:30 while in their meetings, futures have declined a bit more. There is a slight ‚Äúrisk-off‚Äù feeling. Sales are on the phones with their clients. Senior sales figuring out what their clients want to do and how to get it done, and junior sales trying to flog the morning axes, not completely aware that non of the bids are likely to be there now that the weakness has accelerated. A little while later a salesperson asks the trader where he is on the ShmoGo 7‚Äôs. The trader, a little exasperated by now, shouts out that he can offer them at par, and asks just under his breath, ‚Äúweren‚Äôt you at the morning meeting?‚Äù This gets a little chuckle from the entourage of traders around him. Sales is less impressed, but they were expecting this. The respond with, ‚Äúokay, that‚Äôs what I thought, but my guy is telling me that‚Äôs pretty generic as its is 99/100 everywhere, and he thinks he could get the bonds at 99.5‚Äù. The trader asks the salesperson if their client is a buyer, and after a brief pause while the salesperson checks with the client, he gets the answer that no, they aren‚Äôt a buyer, were just giving some color.
Well, the Dell deal is finally official. With the help of private-equity firm Silver Lake and a boatload of new debt, Dell has announced a deal to take itself private for $24 billion. Dell's public shareholders will get $13.65 a share, which is a considerable premium over the $10 that the stock was trading for last summer. But it's a disappointment for long-term Dell shareholders who have seen their investment go nowhere but down over the past 13 years. And, at some level, it's also probably galling for those shareholders ó knowing that Michael Dell and Silver Lake would never do this deal if they didn't think they could coin money by doing it. Which they undoubtedly will. To be clear and fair: Dell is explicitly allowing other potential buyers to make alternative bids in case someone wants to cut a better deal for Dell shareholders. And that's a smart and fair thing to do. But whether or not someone else offers to pay a dollar or two more a share to Dell's current shareholders, Michael Dell and Silver Lake obviously think they can wring a lot more value out of the company than that. And, as a result, this deal is yet another indictment of the way our public markets work. Why should Dell have to go private to allow Michael Dell to do the things necessary to create a lot more value for shareholders? Why can't Michael Dell just do these things now, for Dell's public shareholders? The answer, presumably, is that Michael Dell doesn't feel like he can do these things under the scrutiny of the public markets. Given that Dell going private is pretty much a fait accompli at this point, we might as well speculate about what Michael Dell and his private-equity partners will do when the deal closes: That's standard private-equity operating procedure. When these techniques are done well, they actually improve companies, in addition to coining money for private-equity investors. When they're done badly, of course, they gut companies and overload them with debt, so that they collapse within a year or two of being sold back to the public markets. There's nothing wrong with the good part of that. But if that's what Michael Dell and his private-equity backers plan to do with Dell when they buy it ó if that's the way to generate an awesome return for shareholders ó it's too bad that they couldn't just do it now, for Dell's current shareholders. Now, to be clear, Michael Dell is not selling his stock, so he is assuming a lot of risk here. If he wanted to cash out, he could do that now, and just leave Silver Lake to take all the risk and get all the upside. But given that Dell has $15 billion in cash, the conclusion of both parties is probably that the risk isn't all that great. SEE ALSO: Dell Going Private For $13.65 A Share
Even if you're bored of hearing about pre-crisis financial industry shenanigans, the government's complaint against rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's (S&amp;P) is worth your while. The Justice Department alleges that S&amp;P had full knowledge that the ratings it was stamping on Residential Mortgage Backed Securities (RMBS) were too high, and the DOJ has collected e-mails and instant messages that corroborate that assertion in the most embarrassing and damning way possible. Analysts even made a fun song about the destruction of the U.S. mortgage market, to the tune of Talking Heads classic, 'Burning Down The House.' But first, on March 1st 2007, David Tesher, the Managing Director of S&amp;P's Cash CDO (Collateralized Debt Obligation) Group held a meeting in which he explained to analysts that the RMBS market was about to die a grizzly death. He went on to explain that the issuers of these rates (banks) were trying to close deals as quickly as possible. † After this meeting, two analysts had an instant message exchange lamenting that a market crash would mean a "grumpy" Managing Director and grumpy bankers (page 70):  † Sounds† like a bit of an understatement, no? That said, it's not as if analyst were lost on the conflict of interest in rating these instruments and getting paid by the banks they were rating them for. They talked about it amongst themselves. Here's the famous "it could be structured by cows" and we would rate it line between two analysts in April of 2007 (page 80):  † At a certain point, the only people these analysts could really commiserate with were the clients that they were rating these securities for ó Wall Street bankers. Here's a July 2007 conversation between an analyst and his client in which he says that the entire system is completely insane (page 99).  † All this doesn't mean that no one at S&amp;P was having fun, though. In March of 2007 one analysts (referred to as "Analyst D") wrote a little ditty about the collapse of the mortgage market set to the tune of the Talking Heads Song, 'Burning Down the House.' Of course, Analyst D was asked to hold off on e-mailing the song (and the attached video performance) but he kindly offered to perform the song in anyone's cubicle upon request.   All singing, all dancing financial collapse. If you have that video, please send it over to Business Insider. Until then, you can make do with the original (somehow): 
Months after speculation of a cash crisis at JCPenney, bond investors are accusing the company of defaulting on its debt.¬† Lawyers who say they represent half of the holders of a tranche of JCPenney bonds due in 2037 sent the company a letter alleging that it breached a bond agreement,¬†Sapna Maheshwari at Bloomberg reported.¬† JCPenney has filed a lawsuit¬†to combat the accusations and alleges in a separate statement that the investors "intended to create self-interested trading opportunities in the market." The company's rebuttal complaint states that it has been exposed to¬†‚Äúto imminent, irreparable harm,‚Äù and that the claims could put the company at risk of demands for payment on upwards of $2.8 billion. Bond lawsuits aside, JCPenney's sales have declined considerably since CEO Ron Johnson took over a year ago.¬† JCPenney has struggled to find a concrete strategy or marketing plan, leaving customers confused. The company just laid off about 1,000 people.¬† There have been rumors of a cash crisis at JCPenney since at least November.¬† "JCPenney may have to raise capital or consider removing itself from the public markets (getting certainty of value for shareholders instead of staying public and hoping the turnaround brings to surface unrealized value)," Brian Sozzi, chief equities analyst at NBG Productions, said.

Julia La Roche for Business InsiderHundreds of young professionals, including a bunch of Wall Street traders and a Sports Illustrated swimsuit model, partied last night at a swanky rooftop hotel in downtown Manhattan. It was all for charity, though. Autism Speaks to Young Professionals (AS2YP) hosted one of its popular charity galas at¬†Ph-D at the Dream Hotel. ¬† With tickets starting at $100, guests imbibed cocktails, enjoyed hors d'oeuvres and listened to a DJ, while raising funds and awareness for autism ‚Äî a disorder that affects one in every 88 children. We checked out the event last night and have included highlights in the slides that follow.¬† We also ran into a bunch of floor traders at the event. For many of them, autism hits really close to home. ¬† "They're a supportive group. I have a child with autism and I really don't have to ask twice. People come out to support us," Danny Ryan, AS2YP co-chair and NYSE senior floor official told Business Insider. The NYSE traders have a reputation for supporting each other through challenging times.¬† Ryan told us that just last month when a NYSE floor trader was badly injured in the ferry boat accident in the Financial District, they held a small event to raise some money. Even traders who haven't been on the floor in a decade came down to contribute. ¬† "It's a family. Guys really, really do feel like we take care of our own. As a father of a child with autism, it's very comforting knowing that when you're going through this battle you're trying to do things to help others. These guys will always have your back. I'm very lucky." ¬† While AS2YP events are a way for young professionals to get involved in charity early on and raise funds, it's much more about educating the next generation of parents.¬†"I'm a parent of a nine-year-old son with autism," committee member Phil Quartuccio, managing member of Illustro Trading said. "It's absolutely not about fundraising at this level, it's awareness." ¬† This is AS2YP's fourth year hosting these galas. ¬†If you missed it last night, we've got all the photos you need right here.¬†

El PaisSpain is in the middle of a major government corruption scandal, with the governing People's Party (PP) accused of running a secret accounting system for kickbacks from big businesspeople. The scandal allegedly goes all the way to the top, with El Pais publishing handwritten notes that appear to show Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy having received almost $340,000 in undeclared money over almost 10 years. The documents have led to widespread calls for Rajoy to resign. However, PP officials have repeatedly denied the El Pais documents. In an interview aired on 13tv last night in Spain, the man at the center of the scandal, former treasurer Luis B√°rcenas, said he had done nothing wrong and had earned his money legally. According to a transcript of the interview published on El Economista, B√°rcenas suggested that the handwritten checking accounts were a forgery, created by "someone close to the party". He said he would be ready for a calligraphy test to certify that it is not his handwriting. On the same show, PP secretary general Mar√≠a Dolores de Cospedal that some "half-truths" appeared in the documents. The allegation that someone linked to PP could have faked the notes seems to tie in with Rajoy's own bizarre admission that some part of the scandal is in fact true. From El Pais yesterday: ‚ÄúI repeat what I said Saturday: everything that has been said about me and my colleagues in the party is untrue, except for some things that have been published by some media outlets.‚Äù On Tuesday morning El Pais reported that it has handed over the handwritten notes to anti-corruption police, and the PP is demanding that they be analyzed to prove their authenticity. Whether the donations were actually illegal is actually a matter of debate. The BBC notes that until 2007, Spanish political parties were allowed to receive anonymous donations, while El Pais says that as all donations were under 120,000 euros they may be exempt from tax charges. However, in a country that has suffered badly since the 2008 crisis, any hint of corruption involving Spain's once booming construction industry would be extremely damaging for the PP. The party has threatened El Pais with legal action over the publication. Speaking to 13tv yesterday, Cospedal said the newspaper had created "great social alarm" with a "photocopy of a photocopy of something nobody can verify."
At the press conference following the 24th German-Spanish government consultation, he‚Äôd stand next to her, illuminated by her glory. He‚Äôd brag about implementing structural reforms, cleaning up the bailed-out banking sector, and moving Spain forward. He‚Äôd point at yields on government debt trending down toward normalcy. No, Spain wouldn‚Äôt need another bailout. All due to his excellent governance. Merkel would endorse him with her benevolent smile. It would cement his political position in Spain. She‚Äôd rave about how the country has emerged from the debt crisis thanks to his tireless, bold, and courageous work in tightening the belts of his people. But instead, Spanish stocks took a nosedive. Yields jumped. And the press conference turned into a slugfest about the corruption scandal in Spain. The scandal burst into the open when El Pa√≠s published documents, allegedly handwritten by Luis B√°rcenas, the ex-treasurer of Rajoy‚Äôs conservative People‚Äôs Party (PP). According to these ledgers, leading members of the PP had been paid bribes for years, with Rajoy receiving about ‚Ç¨25,000 per year. B√°rcenas himself is up to his neck in hot water; it was discovered that he had ‚Ç¨22 million in Swiss bank accounts. The opposition has called for Rajoy‚Äôs head. So Merkel and Rajoy were confronted with questions about the scandal‚Äîand Merkel with a blast from her past, a reference to the ‚Äúblack money affair‚Äù of the 1990s when her party, the CDU, under Chancellor Helmut Kohl, used an elaborate system of Swiss bank accounts to hide illegal political contributions. The scandal broke in late 1999 with the arrest of CDU treasurer Walther Leisler Kiep for tax fraud. It ballooned relentlessly. After a few weeks, even Kohl‚Äîby then no longer chancellor‚Äîadmitted to the ‚Äúblack accounts.‚Äù It led to an investigation by a parliamentary committee. Turns out, Kohl had used the funds to support candidates who sided with him. Numerous corporations and politicians were tangled up in it, including current Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch√§uble. In short, a press conference from hell. Merkel emphasized that the B√°rcenas scandal had not been part of their discussion. Instead, they‚Äôd talked about educational and health policies and renewable energy. And Rajoy, she said, explained his successes in implementing structural reforms and fighting unemployment.... Alas, Spain‚Äôs unemployment rate hit 26% in December, leaving 5.97 million people unemployed, up from 5.27 million when Rajoy took office in late 2011. Youth unemployment surged to 55.1%. On Monday, more bad news: the number of people receiving unemployment compensation jumped in January to the historic high of 4.98 million‚Äîup from 2 million in 2007. And the number of employed people dropped by 263,243. El Pa√≠s declared morosely, ‚Äúthe labor market begins the year with the destruction of 8,500 jobs per day.‚Äù Nevertheless, Merkel had the ‚Äúgreatest respect and admiration‚Äù for what Rajoy has implemented in terms of structural reforms. It would take time for them to do their magic, she conceded, and youth unemployment was ‚Äúdepressingly‚Äù high. Yet she was ‚Äúconvinced‚Äù that the Spanish government, ‚Äúwith Mariano Rajoy as head,‚Äù would be able to resolve the problems. ‚ÄúGermany will support him with all its power,‚Äù she said. But wasn‚Äôt she worried about Rajoy‚Äôs loss of authority? Merkel dodged; she‚Äôd already said everything, she said. ‚ÄúWe will continue to work well together,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúWe have a very trusting relationship.‚Äù¬† Rajoy spent his time furiously defending himself. ‚ÄúI have the same desire, the same hope, strength, and courage that I had when I arrived to overcome one of the most difficult situations of the past 30 years,‚Äù he said. His ability to lead the government has not been weakened. His party has a ‚Äústable majority‚Äù and ‚Äúclear goals‚Äù and would continue the reform efforts. And no, he would not resign. But the questions kept coming. Rajoy had initially denied all B√°rcenas-related allegations in their totality. But some of the elements in those documents inconveniently turned out to match reality. So why were these elements true but not those relating to him and other members of the party leadership? Yes, some things were true, he conceded, but ‚Äúnothing that refers to me and my colleagues in the party is true.‚Äù He was flailing to avoid the dire fate that befell George Papandreou, the conniving prime minister of Greece, and Silvio Berlusconi, the scandal-prone prime minister of Italy. Under pressure from Merkel‚Äôs Eurozone clan, they were sacked in November 2011 and replaced by unelected technocrats. Merkel‚Äôs support suggests that replacing Rajoy isn‚Äôt on the table just yet, though Spain is sinking deeper into its crisis that started with a pricked real estate and credit bubble, morphed into a debt crisis, a banking crisis, an economic crisis with an unemployment fiasco, and now into a confidence crisis that is sending tremors through the most important institutions of the Spanish democracy.

ElvertBarnes via FlickrThe January reading of the ISM non-manufacturing (services) index fell to 55.2 in January. But this was a tad higher than the 55.0 expected by economists. Any number above 50 signals expansion. From ISM: ...This indicates continued growth at a slightly slower rate in the non-manufacturing sector. The Non-Manufacturing Business Activity Index registered 56.4 percent, which is 4.4 percentage points lower than the seasonally adjusted 60.8 percent reported in December, reflecting growth for the 42nd consecutive month. The New Orders Index decreased by 3.9 percentage points to 54.4 percent, and the Employment Index increased 2.2 percentage points to 57.5 percent, indicating growth in employment for the sixth consecutive month.

With each month, the US economy becomes steadily more automated. In January the US economy added just 4,000 manufacturing jobs, and the net increase since July is zero. Yet last month, manufacturing activity rose by its fastest rate since April, according to the Institute for Supply Management. The difference boils down to robots, which pose an increasingly nagging paradox: the more there are, the better for overall growth (since they boost productivity); yet the worse things become for the middle class. US median income has fallen in each of the last five years. He also notes that the effects of technology are only just beginning to be felt in education and healthcare ñ the two most labour-intensive areas of the US economy that both suffer from productivity stagnation: Online education is beginning to spread.

Italy is suddenly back in turmoil. The economy is crappy again and the stock market tanked 4.5% yesterday. The scary part is that there's an election coming up in just under 20 days, Silvio Berlusconi could return to power. Here's how it got to this, and why Europe is so scared. In late 2011, Italy's controversial PM Berlusconi was basically forced out of office by rising Italian yields. Bloomberg Berlusconi's departure and the entrance of ECB-favorite technocrat Mario Monti was welcomed by markets. Italian borrowing costs quickly fell, helped in part by the ECB 3-year LTRO program, which eased funding for banks. Mario Monti has helped get things under control on the sovereign debt front, but the economy still stinks, and people are angry that an unelected technocrat has done what it takes to deal with bondholders, but hasn't done anything to improve the real economy. Today's horrible services PMI report in Italy is a good reminder of how bad things are. Italy is holding an election on February 24-25, and the favorite is leftist Pier Luigi Bersani. Wikimedia Commons He started the election with a big lead in the polls, but the gap against Berlusconi's conservative party has been narrowing. Nomura Why has Berlusconi's party been rallying? Bloomberg explains: Former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has cut the lead of front-runner Pier Luigi Bersani to 5 percentage points in the countdown to Italian parliamentary elections Feb. 24-25. Berlusconi is tapping into public anger over a banking scandal at Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA and soaking up the popular adulation over the signing of striker Mario Balotelli to Berlusconiís Milan soccer team. Monte dei Paschi is a bank that's closely associated with Italy's left. People hate bailouts. And yes, people like that Silvio Berlusconi signed footballer Mario Balotelli to his soccer team. Berlusconi even had an amazing quote comparing Balotelli to Mario Monti: "Balotelli is the better Mario. He scored two goals, and made Germans cry. Monti scored a property tax, and made Italians cry." (Via Alberto Nardelli) ESPN The belief is that the leftist Bersani is still going to win the election, but what if he doesn't? JPMorgan's Alex White muses that if Berlusconi wins, Italian borrowing costs could rise, the ECB would need to step in and backstop the country, and that that would create political problems and anger in Germany: †But, what ifÖ..? Like us, European policymakers have (so far) regarded a Berlusconi victory as a tail-risk event, but they are now increasingly focused on the need to prepare for such a potential outcome. Concentrating their minds is a possible worse-case scenario, the ëbadí trajectory which we lay out below. We also lay out a more likely trajectory of events as we think they might unfold if Berlusconi were to win.†† A bad trajectory The worst fear for regional policymakers is that a Berlusconi victory, if managed poorly, results in heavy market pressure on Italy - ultimately forcing it to seek an ESM-ECCL package as a precursor to activating the OMT. German MPs would then be forced to vote on a support package that opened the door to ECB intervention for Italy with all of their moral hazard questions remaining unanswered (and with a Berlusconi Government the recipient of any support). Voters in Germany would be left asking serious questions about the OMT (effectively being faced with the evidence of what the ECB commitment can mean) and punish the Chancellor accordingly. Add in the (currently rather remote) fear of Draghi being further damaged by the MPS scandal and there is a risk of a very damaging hit to sentiment and to the prospects of Chancellor Merkelís reelection. We think this is unlikely to happen; but it is the scenario that policymakers are focused on avoiding. We thought the February 24-25 election was going to be boring. Now we're excited.

The final price is $13.65 a share. The deal is valued at $24.4 billion. Company founder Michael Dell is taking the company private in partnership with private equity firm Silver Lake. According to the release, the buyout will be funded by a big consortium. Dell and Silver Lake are going to finance it along with Microsoft which is kicking in $2 billion as a loan, according to the release. Other financing will come from BofA Merrill Lynch, Barclays, Credit Suisse and RBC Capital Markets. Microsoft's involvement in the process is particularly noteworthy. The reason Dell is going private is that its business of selling Windows-based PCs has not been going well. If, as a private company, Dell wanted to initiate a radical change and break away from its reliance on Microsoft, that would appear less likely with Microsoft's involvement. And from Microsoft's perspective, it is likely to upset its partners. Remember, the entire PC industry is in decline. This isn't a Dell-only problem. If HP is on the cusp of going to out of business, will Microsoft rush in with billions of dollars to bail it out? At $13.65 a share, Dell says in the release it's buying the company for a 25% premium over the stock's closing price before news leaked of a potential buyout. We expect there will be multiple shareholder lawsuits over this deal. Just a year ago, the stock was trading at ~$17.66 a share. Today, Dell and Silver Lake want to buy the whole thing for considerably less. Dell has a 45-day "go-shop" period where the board can look for a better deal. Why is Dell going private? In general, the real reason a company goes private is that its backers think the market is undervaluing it. It also believes that it can fix things up, then re-enter the public markets at a higher valuation delivering a big return, in this case, for Michael Dell and Silver Lake. In the release Dell explained the move, saying, "We can deliver immediate value to stockholders, while we continue the execution of our long-term strategy and focus on delivering best-in-class solutions to our customers as a private enterprise. Dell has made solid progress executing this strategy over the past four years, but we recognize that it will still take more time, investment and patience, and I believe our efforts will be better supported by partnering with Silver Lake in our shared vision." Here's the release, we're updating this post as we go, so more to come. Dell Inc. today announced it has signed a definitive merger agreement under which Michael Dell, Dellís Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, in partnership with global technology investment firm Silver Lake, will acquire Dell. Under the terms of the agreement, Dell stockholders will receive $13.65 in cash for each share of Dell common stock they hold, in a transaction valued at approximately $24.4 billion. The price represents a premium of 25 percent over Dellís closing share price of $10.88 on Jan. 11, 2013, the last trading day before rumors of a possible going-private transaction were first published; a premium of approximately 35 percent over Dellís enterprise value as of Jan. 11, 2013; and a premium of approximately 37 percent over the average closing share price during the previous 90 calendar days ending Jan. 11, 2013. The buyers will acquire for cash all of the outstanding shares of Dell not held by Mr. Dell and certain other members of management. The Dell Board of Directors acting on the recommendation of a special committee of independent directors unanimously approved a merger agreement under which Michael Dell and Silver Lake Partners will acquire Dell and take the company private subject to a number of conditions, including a vote of the unaffiliated stockholders. Mr. Dell recused himself from all Board discussions and from the Board vote regarding the transaction. A Special Committee was formed after Mr. Dell first approached Dellís Board of Directors in August 2012 with an interest in taking the company private. Led by Lead Director Alex Mandl, the Special Committee retained independent financial and legal advisors J.P. Morgan and Debevoise &amp; Plimpton LLP to advise the Special Committee with respect to its consideration of strategic alternatives, the acquisition proposal and the subsequent negotiation of the merger agreement. The Special Committee also engaged a leading management consulting firm to conduct an independent analysis, including a review of strategic alternatives for Dell and opportunities for the company as a public entity, and thereafter engaged Evercore Partners. The merger agreement provides for a so-called ìgo-shopî period, during which the Special Committee ñ with the assistance of Evercore Partners ñ will actively solicit, receive, evaluate and potentially enter into negotiations with parties that offer alternative proposals. The initial go-shop period is 45 days. Following that period, the Special Committee will be permitted to continue discussions and enter into or recommend a transaction with any person or group that submitted a qualifying proposal during the 45-day period. A successful competing†bidder who makes a qualifying proposal during the initial go-shop period would†bear a $180 million (less than 1 percent) termination fee. For†a competing bidder who did not qualify during the initial go-shop period,†the termination fee†would be $450 million. Mr. Mandl, lead director of Dellís Board of Directors, said: ìThe Special Committee and its advisors conducted a disciplined and independent process intended to ensure the best outcome for shareholders. Importantly, the go-shop process provides a real opportunity to determine if there are alternatives superior to the present offer from Mr. Dell and Silver Lake.î Mr. Dell said: ìI believe this transaction will open an exciting new chapter for Dell, our customers and team members. We can deliver immediate value to stockholders, while we continue the execution of our long-term strategy and focus on delivering best-in-class solutions to our customers as a private enterprise. Dell has made solid progress executing this strategy over the past four years, but we recognize that it will still take more time, investment and patience, and I believe our efforts will be better supported by partnering with Silver Lake in our shared vision. I am committed to this journey and I have put a substantial amount of my own capital at risk together with Silver Lake, a world-class investor with an outstanding reputation. We are committed to delivering an unmatched customer experience and excited to pursue the path ahead.î "Michael Dell is a true visionary and one of the preeminent leaders of the global technology industry," said Egon Durban, a Silver Lake Managing Partner. "Silver Lake is looking forward to partnering with him, the talented management team at Dell and the investor group to innovate, invest in long-term growth initiatives and accelerate the company's transformation strategy to become an integrated and diversified global IT solutions provider." Following completion of the transaction, Mr. Dell, who owns approximately 14 percent of Dellís common shares, will continue to lead the company as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and will maintain a significant equity investment in Dell by contributing his shares of Dell to the new company, as well as making a substantial additional cash investment. Dell will continue to be headquartered in Round Rock, Texas. The transaction will be financed through a combination of cash and equity contributed by Mr. Dell, cash funded by investment funds affiliated with Silver Lake, cash invested by MSD Capital, L.P., a $2 billion loan from Microsoft, rollover of existing debt, as well as debt financing that has been committed by BofA Merrill Lynch, Barclays, Credit Suisse and RBC Capital Markets (in alphabetical order), and cash on hand. There is no financing condition. The transaction is subject to other customary conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals, in addition to the Dell stockholder approvals described above. The transaction is expected to close before the end of the second quarter of Dellís FY2014. For further information regarding all terms and conditions contained in the definitive merger agreement, please see Dellís Current Report on Form 8-K, which will be filed in connection with this transaction. J.P. Morgan and Evercore Partners are acting as financial advisors and Debevoise &amp; Plimpton LLP is acting as legal advisor to the Special Committee of Dellís Board of Directors. Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. is acting as financial advisor and Hogan Lovells US LLP is acting as legal advisor to Dell. Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz is acting as legal advisor to Mr. Dell. BofA Merrill Lynch, Barclays, Credit Suisse and RBC Capital Markets (in alphabetical order) are acting as financial advisors to Silver Lake, and Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett LLP is acting as legal advisor to Silver Lake.
Casey Research via YouTubeRichard RussellLegendary Dow theorist Richard Russell says investors should approach the latest dow theory buy signal with trepidation. In brief, Dow theory says that when the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Dow Jones Transportation Average move in tandem, up or down, the rest of the market will move with it. If one is making a new high, while the other is not doing well, you should be skeptical of the durability of the rally. We told you about a developing Dow theory buy signal a couple weeks ago ó the Dow Transports hit a high, catching up with Dow Industrials, which had also hit a high. † But Russell warns that Dow theory doesn't operate in a bubble.† There's another element to consider: the Relative Strength Index, or RSI. From King World News: It seems so easy -- all the Dow has to do is climb another 174 points, and eureka, it's at a new record high, and at the same time it has confirmed the new record highs in the Transportation Average. † Wait, note that RSI is at its severe overbought zone for the first time in almost two years. †In the last five years, RSI has signaled overbought five times. †At the bottom of the chart we see the 89-day rate-of-change (this is momentum). Here's the chart via King World News: Richard Russell/King World News With markets near there all-time highs, it'll be interesting to see which market experts will be proven right and which ones proven wrong.

Goldman's Alec Phillips has a great note out about the coming decline in government spending. It turns out, we're about to see a period of spending declines that is historically very rare. It's all about the sequester and the decline in war spending. In addition to sequestration, two other factors are likely to reduce real federal consumption and investment (i.e., the components of federal spending that is counted toward GDP in the national accounts) over the next few years:¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Spending caps enacted in 2011. In addition to establishing the sequester, the Budget Control Act of 2011 also established spending caps that have already taken effect. These are expected to reduce real yoy spending growth by $20bn in 2013 and by another $10bn in 2014. Unless Congress designates spending as "emergency," spending above the caps results in across-the-board cuts similar to but separate from the across the board cuts set to take effect March 1.¬†¬†¬†¬† Reduced war spending. Congress appropriated roughly $160bn in 2010 and 2011 for overseas military operations; this has been reduced to around $100bn for 2013. The President's most recent budget proposed to cap war spending going forward, which it estimated would reduce war-related spending by around $30bn in 2013, and by $50bn to $60bn in 2014. Although some war spending ends up being accounted for as transfer payments to the rest of the world--for example, when the US government reimburses foreign powers for joint military operations--the majority of it shows up as federal consumption and gross investment.¬†¬† Sequestration, spending caps, and reduced war spending will together reduce real federal consumption and gross investment by 11% over the next two years. This is a large decline in historical context, but it is not without precedent. This would mark the third decline in the last 50 years; the first occurred around 1970, after Vietnam War spending had peaked, followed by another around 1990 as military spending declined following the end of the Cold War and multiple rounds of spending caps were enacted.

The Globe and MailThe last time we heard from Nomura's bearish Bob Janjuah was back in November when he warned that stocks could experience "a parabolic spike powerful enough to take S&amp;P ‚Äì briefly ‚Äì into the 1500s, before resuming the longer-term march over the rest of 2013 and 2014 to the 800s." Last week, the S&amp;P 500 went above 1,500 for the first time since 2007. Janjuah reminds us of that call in his note this morning.¬† However, he also cautions that we are likely to see a few more corrections and rallies before we could see the mega-plunge.¬† From his note: The number of times I have heard from clients that ‚Äòwith central banks in full QE mode, financial market risk asset prices can ONLY rally‚Äô can now almost be described as a cacophony. The key word here is ‚Äòalmost‚Äô. I don‚Äôt think investors are yet ‚Äòfully‚Äô positioned. We are ‚Äònot there yet‚Äô. There is not yet sufficient leverage in risk-on positioning in my view. I think we need at least another round or two of ‚Äòbuying the dip‚Äô before we can consider positioning to be at extreme enough levels to set up the conditions necessary for a major sell-off (25% to 50%) as opposed to a minor correction (5% to 10%). Janjuah's primary longer-term concerns revolve around "wasteful government largesse" and central banks' unconventional efforts to support the financial system and stimulate the economy.¬† Here's an excerpt: ...Future generations will and indeed already are beginning to pay (chronic youth unemployment in the Western world is the current channel) for what I see as deeply depressing policy settings and failed policymaker thinking, which persists with the idea that some form of debt-fuelled asset price elevation will lead to real wealth creation, which in turn will fix all our ills... Here's his outlook: As can be inferred from the above, in the medium term (2 quarters +/- 1 quarter), and as per the route map in my previous notes, I think risk can rally further. I continue to believe that the S&amp;P500 can trade up towards the 1575/1550 area, where we have, so far, a grand double top. I would not be surprised to see the S&amp;P trade marginally through the 2007 all-time nominal high (the real high was of course seen over a decade ago ‚Äì so much for equities as a long-term vehicle for wealth creation!). A weekly close at a new all-time high would I think lead to the final parabolic spike up which creates the kind of positioning extreme and leverage extreme needed to create the conditions for a 25% to 50% collapse in equities over the rest of 2013 and 2014, driven by real economy reality hitting home, and by policymaker failure/loss of faith in ‚Äòtheir system‚Äô "Enjoy the dips," he writes. "And good luck for 2013 and beyond." SEE ALSO: The Stupidest Reason To Sell Stocks &gt;

The Wall Street consensus is that Treasury yields are headed higher in 2013. That's big news because it could mark the end of a three-decade bull market in bonds. Strategists expect those higher yields ñ driven by an upturn in economic growth ñ to cause bond investors, who after three decades aren't used to seeing negative returns, to reallocate toward equities. Hence, a "Great Rotation." The prospect of higher yields has the government bond market on edge, but it's also sparked some intense analysis of what could happen to corporate debt markets if rates rise. The rumblings from a few firms in notes to clients are that not everyone is going to come out a winner. To put it another way, rising rates could wreak serious havoc on corporate debt markets. BofA credit strategist Hans Mikkelsen describes how it could unfold in what he describes as the "biggest risk" to the market in a note to clients: In our view, a disorderly rotation out of bonds ñ characterized by higher interest rates and wider credit spreads ñ is the biggest risk for investment grade corporate bond investors this year. The key problem is that, with the rise of bond funds and ETFs, individual investors now have a means to trade illiquid corporate bonds in a much more liquid manner. When interest rates rise and NAVs decline, we are concerned that redemptions will lead to a situation where too many illiquid underlying corporate bonds come out of funds ñ especially as dealers have little capacity to act as buffer in the new regulatory environment. Forced selling ñ and no one to take the other side of the trade. †"But we have never seen a disorderly rotation," writes Mikkelsen. So, how that sort of scenario would pan out is uncertain. We have seen two big moves out of bonds spurred by rising interest rates, in 1994 and in 1999, but the picture is radically different now, thanks to the rise of mutual funds in the corporate bond market. Federal Reserve Flow of Funds, BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research Mutual funds and ETFs, whose investors are typically going to head for the exits if they observe negative returns, have accounted for a big portion of the buying in recent years as investors across the spectrum have searched for yield. Thus, a decent share of the market is exposed to forced selling by these funds. In comparing today's set-up to 1994 and 1999, Mikkelsen writes: However, what is different this time is that, following continued declining interest rates and quantitative easing, bond fund assets under management have expanded significantly. Moreover, the share of corporate bonds in mutual fund fixed income assets has increased to 42% from 24% in 1994 and 31% in 1999. Hence, mutual funds and ETFs now own 19% of the corporate bond market (high grade and high yield), up sharply from 9% and 10% in 1994 and 1999, respectively. Thus, if we were to experience outflows from bond funds of the magnitude seen in 1994 and 1999, the impact on corporate bonds this time would be much more severe. On top of the illiquid nature of the instruments being used to trade corporate bonds and the growing share of the market held by those instruments, there may be another massive, secular headwind for credit markets to contend with if things really pan out for the American economy. The "Great Rotation" itself. Huge January flows into equity funds weren't a sign of the Rotation, but it still exists as a prediction for the latter half of 2013 or 2014 if U.S. economic growth picks up as market economists expect. So, here is what the "Great Rotation" looks like from the credit perspective, according to Mikkelsen: Moreover, following the extended declines in interest rates, and associated outsized fixed income total returns, households now hold more than 13% of their financial assets in fixed income ñ at the upper end of the historical range and†sharply above the low of 8% we saw more than 30-years ago in the early 1980s before interest rates began their secular decline. This higher fixed income allocation to us is a direct result of the extended environment of declining interest rates ñ when interest rates start increasing, we look for households to reduce allocations to fixed income. This, despite the underlying bond friendly demographics. Of course householdsí percentage allocation to fixed income automatically declines when stock prices increase ñ but there is reason to suspect that households will play a more active role in rebalancing out of bonds, into stocks as interest rates increase. Combine the "Great Rotation" with a corporate bond market uniquely vulnerable to rising interest rates and credit markets may have a tough go of it this year or next. Mikkelsen thinks 10-year Treasury yields would have to keep rising past 2.5 percent and on toward 3 percent in 2013 in order for a sell-off in credit like the one described above to occur. "Timing is obviously also important," he writes, "as the disorderly scenario requires a fairly rapid, as opposed to slow and drawn out, increase in rates." Citi strategist Stephen Antczak, on the other hand, writes that if 10-year yields rise "anywhere near what our economists expect†(again, 2.5% by year end)," that total returns in bond funds could be negative, which would create a forced selling situation.

YoutubeAswath Damodaran, NYU's legendary valuation expert, recently argued that there was a 90 percent chance that Apple was undervalued.¬† This comes in the wake of Apple shares' breathtaking plunge from recent highs. In a new blog post, Damodaran thinks that management can learn a few things from the recent market volatility, and he offers some advice. "I know... I know... All of this will make Apple a more boring company," he writes. But if Apple can incorporate these tips, the stock may regain respect in the markets. Here are his four tips verbatim. Emphasis ours: Despite offering recommendations that would make the company "boring," Damodaran thinks Apple could become exciting again by going for "creative destruction in new markets." "I am sure that my airline experience would be better on Apple Air, my hotel stay more comfortable at Apple Hotels and my tax money better spent with Apple Government," he half-jokes.

Wikimedia CommonsThe break is over. It's that time again to shift our attention back to the US fiscal situation. Nomura's America's Morning Comment notes the confluence of events (sequester, budget, debt ceiling, new budget outlook) that will begin to dominate. Attention may start to shift back to the US as the pieces of the upcoming fiscal policy negotiations begin to fall into place as the strong European data quell yesterdayís euro area political concerns. Yesterday, President Obama signed into law the debt ceiling extension bill that will extend US borrowing capacity through mid-May. Yesterday was also the statutory deadline to submit a budget request set out in the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921, a largely symbolic deadline which carries no enforcement or penalty mechanism. Still, Speaker Boehner used the deadline to propose the introduction of a bill that would require the President to submit a balanced budget. House Republicans will be discussing the measure in a closed conference this morning followed by a media briefing with the partyís leadership.† Separately, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) will be releasing its semi-annual budget and economic outlook report today which will be the subject of a House Budget Committee hearing tomorrow. Meanwhile, the House and Senate Democrats will be holding policy retreats this week where we expect leaks and press reports to provide insight into the partyís strategic approach to the upcoming sequestration and budget negotiations. The CBO report and news flow out of both partiesí leadership may begin to shift market attention back toward the unresolved, and still contentious fiscal policy debates.
Good morning. Here's what you need to know.
Wikimedia/Presidenza della Repubblica and Wikimedia/ESMTItalian stocks are rallying over 1% today, but the upcoming election in Italy (Feb 24-25) is getting lots of talk. In a note, Nomura's geopolitical guru Alistair Newton explains the two facts about the polls that have people so worried. Looking at a range of polls: Bene Commune was standing between 34% and 37% a week ago and is now 33-36%: Mr Berlusconi‚Äôs Il Popolo della Libert√† was 28-29% and is now 28-32%; and Con Monti per l‚ÄôItalia remains around 13-14%. Nevertheless, taking account of some possible bias in the polls: -- Bene Commune‚Äôs lead over Il Popolo della Libert√† is narrow enough to be coming close to statistical margin of error; and, --Perhaps more significantly, the combined Bene Commune/Con Monti per l‚ÄôItalia vote currently looks to be right on the edge or possible just below what would be required to secure a majority under the different electoral system which prevails for Italy‚Äôs upper house. So the lead of the top-tier liberal party is diminishing, and the size of the possible coalition between that party and the Monti coalition is getting too small, perhaps, to form a secure majority. So why did Bene Commune start to drift lower in the polls? It all start with, what else, a troubled bank: However, any advantage which this offered Pier Luigi Bersani and his left of centre Bene Commune coalition at the outset may be being eroded by the Monte dei Paschi affair given the bank‚Äôs close association with the left in Italian politics. Furthermore, political opponents are claiming that Mario Monti's unpopular property tax was brought in to pay for the Monte dei Paschi bail-out a few months ago: whatever the rights and wrongs of this claim, it does appear to be sticking in some quarters and may be damaging the prospects of Mr Monti‚Äôs Con Monti per l‚ÄôItalia too. So there you have it. A bank weakens, a bailout happens, a tax is levied, Berlusconi promises to reverse the tax. And voila: You have yourself a race.

Most analysts covering Apple continue to be relentlessly optimistic on the stock, despite its lackluster earnings announcements and precipitous price decline. Even after slashing his price target by $100 to $660, Goldman Sachs analyst Bill Shope says the stock is a "buy." In fact, at Goldman Sachs, Apple is now the most undervalued stock of the ones covered by Goldman's analysts. Goldman's David Kostin recently published a list of 40 stocks with the most upside opportunity relative to the Goldman analyst price targets. Here's the top 10.

Once again. Another fabulous economic report out of Germany, even as its peers remain week. This time its German services PMI. Here's the report, which shows the fastest rise in activity since June, 2011. 
kevinpoh via flickr Creative CommonsItalian non-manufacturing PMI was horrible this morning. From the report: Italy‚Äôs services workforce shrank at a survey-record pace in January, as business activity also decreased at an accelerated rate. New work levels fell more slowly, however, with firms increasing in confidence about growth in output over the coming year. Elsewhere, there was dip in cost inflation from December‚Äôs four-month high, while output prices fell at a modest and slightly slower pace. January saw Italy‚Äôs service sector output contract at a faster rate, as highlighted by the seasonally adjusted Markit/ADACI Business Activity Index ‚Äì which is based on a single question asking respondents to report on the actual change in business activity at their companies compared to one month ago ‚Äì falling from December‚Äôs post of 45.6 to 43.9 in the first survey period of the year. This latest reading was the lowest since last July, and signalled that the sector‚Äôs ongoing sequence of contraction extended into a twentieth straight month.
This is exactly the type of story that makes people deeply suspicious about the sustainability of the Chinese growth model. Dinny McMahon and Colin Murphy at WSJ have a great story about how large corporations, even loss-making ones, are borrowing more and more thanks to the willingness of state-backed banks to keep lending to them. They note, for example, a Chinese shipbuilding company called China Rongsheng Heavy Industries Group Holdings Ltd, which only received 2 orders in the first half of last year, and which is losing money, and yet has seen its debt grow 6x in a few years to $4.5 billion, thanks to loans from China Development Bank and Bank of China. The stock has not had a good run over the last 5 years. Here's a chart via Bloomberg.  According to the article, which cites a standard chartered research report, corporate debt in China is now around 129% of GDP. In a report from BofAML, analyst Winnie Wu said that China was mass-producing Zombie Companies being kept alive by the state. Our Matthew Boesler summarized her take: Although there have been a few high-profile restructurings in China, the bankruptcy landscape has been pretty quiet. Wu says she was actually surprised by the latest data on bad loans from the CBRC because they seem to be massively understating the problem: "The NPL formation seemed to be surprisingly low, given the recent news related to bad debts: Zhongjiang Group, which reportedly filed for bankruptcy, had 3bn loans from CCB. Jade Cargo, an airline which reportedly entered liquidation in June, had 3bn loans from BOC. Rongsheng, the largest private shipbuilder, had 18bn in loans banks are nervously watching. In the troubled solar sector, the top 10 players collectively had 111bn of debts. The relatively few cases seem to suggest that the amount of potential risky loans may be much higher than the reported NPLs." Meanwhile, bad loans in Wenzhou, a city in China's Zhejiang province known in financial circles as ground zero of China's ominous shadow banking system,†recently surged to a 10-year high. Wu calls Zhejiang "an early reflection on China's economic challenges," making it important to keep a close eye on. Wu implies that NPL numbers are being held down ahead of a major leadership transition in the Chinese government that takes place at the beginning of next year in order to ensure social stability, but says it should cause concern "that more 'zombie companies' are being made in the economy." This chart should give you a feel of how 2012 was a gigantic year for bond issuance. BofA/ML
flickr/marcelgermainQuick note: Yesterday there was a jump in Italian borrowing costs, thanks to political fears (the stock market got clubbed as well). In addition to a jump in the Italian stock market, which we mentioned earlier, there's a nice improvement in borrowing costs. Yield on the Italian 2-year is down from 1.77% to 1.67%, a pretty substantial gain. Spain is seeing improvement as well.
With the sharp selloff we've seen to far in February, this is a really intriguing note from BTIG's Dan Greenhaus, about the odds that the market never falls below its January lows for the rest of the year. He writes: With the S&amp;P 500 gaining by over 5% in January, yet still hovering around 1,500 in the face of a meaningful pickup in bullish sentiment despite todayís selloff, we wondered yet again whether January usually provides the low for the year. It certainly does happen; since 1970, a day in January was the absolute low for the S&amp;P 500 roughly 37% of the time including each year from 1995 through 1999 (see table below). However, since 2000, January has been the low just once, in 2012, and one could have bought the index last year at basically the same price on June 1st as on January 1st. Further, each year of the recovery -- 2010, 2011 and 2012 -- saw a meaningful equity declines of at least 10% and in two cases, nearly 20%. So given the internal ìconcernsî weíve been highlighting weíll stick with our ìpauseî thesis. At some point, weíll be ready to press ìplayî again but not before further excesses diminish. Here's his table. Since 2000, only last year saw the lows of the year happen in January. And as he notes, there's been a big decline midway through every post-recovery year. 
YouTubeMarkets are higher in Europe today. They're not dramatically higher, but in the green. Italy is up 0.8%, Spain is up 0.5%, Germany is up about 0.2%. Remember, yesterday Italy fell 4.5% on political concerns. The big news so far today: A very strong Chinese non-manufacturing PMI report, and the Reserve Bank of Australia keeping rates steady.
