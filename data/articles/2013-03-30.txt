AP / Louis LanzanoA few years ago I walked around David Stockman’s backyard. I was admiring his stone walls. We fell into a conversation about rocks and masons. David has a good eye for stone, and he knows the proper way to lay it up (A balance of symmetry and chaos, with the least amount of mortar possible).  I was pleased to learn that he holds stone masons (all artists) in much higher regard than lawyers, bankers and politicians. My kinda guy. We talked about the macro/micro issues at length — Stockman knows the numbers and the history. He has an interesting perspective on the global economic scene. I thought about the meeting later. I concluded that Stockman was not just passionate about the state of affairs — he was out-raged. I wondered why. Stockman is still out-raged. His new book, The Great Deformation, is his opportunity to vent some of that emotion. He does a pretty good job of it. There are a dozen “names” who will cringe reading it. Bruce Krasting This is a history book. It’s a detailed account of the key events since the Depression that have shaped modern finance. I love history, and I’m familiar with those events. Stockman’s spin on financial history makes for a very good read. There’s something for everyone. For example, were you troubled by the bailout of AIG, and TARP? If so, you’ll love this chapter: Paulson’s Folly – The needless Rescue of AIG and Wall Street Do you worry that Bernanke has overplayed his hand with monetary policy? Stockman rips him apart: The Bernanke Bubble: Last Gift to the 1 Percent or  How the Fed Brought the Gambling Mania to America’s Neighborhoods Do TV talking heads influence Fed policy? Stockman says “yes.” The Rant That Shook the Eccles Building: How the Fed Got Cramer’d Worried about U.S. indebtedness to foreign central banks? That’s covered in: Monetary Roach Motels Stockman puts meat on the bones to some old stories. A few examples: Nixon took the USA off of the gold standard in 1971. The motivation and timing was Nixon’s burning desire to win the 1972 elections. He devalued the dollar for a short-term boost to the economy. Tricky Dick rigged the global currency markets to achieve his ends. That makes Watergate look like small beer. Very high stakes poker was played. Nothing new today. During WWII the Fed capped long-term interest rates at 2.5 percent. To hold that level, the Fed bought up all the supply (A slightly different version of today’s QE). The rate cap continued until 1951. How it ended (and the secret fight between Truman and the Fed) is history worth studying. This is a window into what will happen when the Fed is forced to end the current QE. Not surprisingly, it was 5 percent inflation that ended cheap money in 1951. How do you think Bernanke’s QE will end? A central element of the US economy is Roosevelt’s New Deal — Stockman shreds it: The payroll tax has become an anti-jobs monster In truth the trust funds are both meaningless and broke. The fast approaching day of reckoning is thinly disguised by trust fund accounting fiction. There’s plenty of one-liners; a few of the many I found amusing: On George Kaiser‘s “loss” in Solyndra: (How not to make friends in Tulsa) by essentially “shorting” Uncle Sam, George Kaiser stands to harvest a 4.6 times return on his sham investment to “rescue” Solyndra On Elon Musk (How not to make friends in SoCal) That a megalomanical promoter like Elon Musk could walk off with half a billion in taxpayer money, blown in less than four years, and make himself the toast of Hollywood in the process is powerful evidence that the putative conservative parted has vacated the ramparts of the US Treasury. On Bernanke (“befuddled academic“) and Janet Yellen (“career policy apparatchik“): (How not to make friends at the Fed): these hired hands keep the carry trades well lubricated and generate continuous  opportunities for speculators to extract vast economic rents from deformed financial markets Bernanke is the godfather of the debt zombies. On former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, and the AIG bailout: in one of the most egregious derelictions of duty every recorded, Paulson and his posse of Goldmanite hotshots hastily and blindly shielded these behemoths (the TBTF banks) from even a dollar of loss on their AIG insurance policies. On economists: New Deal revivalists Like Paul Krugman are essentially telling fibs and peddling historical legends is not offensive merely because it distorts the distant past. These legends actually compound the deformations of the present by rationalizing policies that cannot succeed and will only bury the nation deeper in debt. Glenn Hubbard was of the opinion that the Wall Street-coddling policies of the Greenspan-Bernanke era had been a roaring success. The preposterous Fred Mishkin headed the posse of debt-bubble deniers who dominated the Fed’s supporting cast. In a major study he concluded that the only bubbles in Iceland were those welling up from its famous hot geysers. Keynes fancied himself a dandy, of course, and would never have been caught wearing the equivalent of Gandihi’s loom. But when it came to nations and their unwashed masses, it is not at all surprising  that he thought the nationalistic and autoartic Nazi Germany was the most likely candidate for early adoption of his program.   My only disappointment with The Great Deformation is that there is very little in the way of what could be done, versus what is being done. Stockman does offer up a few thoughts of what might be considered. These will get more than a few eyebrows raised on Wall Street and in D.C.: - Abolish deposit insurance, strangle the Fed and shrink the banks. - Adopt a Super Glass-Steagall. Abolish bailouts. - Eliminate the Electoral College and establish strict term limits. - A balanced budget, eliminate economic subsidies, shrink the federal government. - Impose a 30 percent tax on wealth to reduce debt to 30 percent of GDP (assumes a $10T tax on the top 10 percent — think Cyprus on steroids) - Eliminate income taxes and replace it with consumption taxes. This is all blue sky stuff. It sounds alright, but it’s not feasible for the U.S. to consider any of these measures. Stockman acknowledges that his list will never see the light of day,  “They would never be adopted in today’s regime of money politics, fast money speculators, and Keynesian economics”. Stockman sees nothing but trouble ahead for the U.S. He realizes that the changes that are needed to avoid the big fall are simply not in the cards. Now I understand why he’s so out-raged.
Business and labor groups have cleared a major hurdle in the path to overhauling the nation's immigration system, according to multiple reports, clearing the way for comprehensive immigration reform legislation to be introduced when Congress is back in session. According to the reports, the powerful business and labor groups reached a deal on a guest-worker program for low-skilled immigrants. New York Sen. Chuck Schumer mediated the deal between AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka andÂ Tom Donohue, the head of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.Â  A guest-worker program had been the biggest hurdle toward comprehensive immigration reform. Labor unions have been against too broad of a guest-worker program, fearing that it would take away jobs from Americans.Â  The agreement means that the so-called bipartisan "Gang of 8" Senators could introduce immigration legislation when Congress reconvenes in April.Â  The New York Times has more details on the program: The agreement resolved what the pay level should be for low-skilled immigrants â€” often employed at hotels and restaurants or on construction projects â€” who could be brought in during labor shortages. Labor groups wanted to ensure that guest workers would not be paid any less than the median wage in their respective industries, and the two sides compromised by agreeing that guest workers would be paid the higher of the prevailing industry wage as determined by the Labor Department or the actual employer wage. Under the deal, guest workers would be allowed to pursue a path to citizenship and to change jobs after they arrived in the United States. Two of the Senators in the so-called "Gang of 8" â€” Schumer and Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) will be on "Meet the Press" Sunday morning.Â

APChristian Gerhartsreiter in court in 2008.A 52-year-old German immigrant by the name of Christian Gerhartsreiter is on trial this month in Los Angeles for the 1985 murder of California man John Sohus. While Gerhartsreiter is little known, many have heard of his alter-ego, Clark Rockefeller. Rockefeller was the subject of Lifetime movie, "Who is Clark Rockefeller?" and a fantastic 2009 Vanity Fair profile. His case may be the most unbelievable case of fraud in modern America. Now, if Gerhartsreiter is found guilty in Los Angeles, it may include a grisly double murder too. In the 1990s, Gerhartsreiter, who is believed to have snuck into the country as a teenager, managed to convince many of New England's elite that he was the moneyed son of George Rockefeller and Mary Roberts. He was so convincing that he managed to marry Sandra Boss, a high-earning Mckinsey executive with degrees from Stanford and Harvard Business School. The couple had a child together, living entirely off of Boss' salary,Â said to be in the range of $2 million a year. The couple eventually separated; Boss became suspicious of her husband's identity (she hired a private detective who confirmed he wasn't a Rockefeller) and his behavior was increasingly bizarre. Gerhartsreiter responded by putting his $800,000 divorce settlement in gold coins and abducting their daughter. After an international manhunt, he was caught and sentenced to jail in 2009 for the kidnapping and assault and battery, with the jury rejecting the defense of insanity. The court case revealed some other tall tales by Gerhartsreiter, according to the Boston Globe, Â including "hisÂ work with the international Trilateral Commission; the blame he bore for the collapse of the Asian financial markets; and that he ended seven mute years as a child with the word 'woofness.'" ABC News had more details from an FBI profile, noting that Gerhartsreiter "does not use metal utensils, will not eat bread unless it is white Pepperidge Farm with the crusts cut off, and that he met Sandra Boss at a Clue party where she was dressed as Scarlett O'Hara and he was Colonel Mustard. The two fell for one another while speaking Klingon, the language spoken by some on the TV series 'Star Trek."" After that trial's publicity, Gerhartsreiter was traced back to Germany, where his birth parents said they had not seen him since 1978. Gerhartsreiter refused to accept this, instead claiming former actress Ann Carter had raised him (a claim she later denied). The new trial in Los Angeles began earlier this month and relates to another time in Gerhartsreiter's life and another identity â€” Christopher Chichester. John Sohus and his wife disappeared in 1985 in San Marino. Sohus' alcoholic mother told friends that the pair had gone on a top secret mission for the government. Nine years later human remains were found under the Sohus' home â€” the remains appeared to belong to John Sohus, and he appeared to have been bludgeoned to death, hacked to pieces, and put into plastic bags. His wife's remains have not been discovered. For decades the case was unsolved, but as more details come out about Gerhartsreiter's past, he has emerged as a clear suspect. A "Christopher Chichester" was known to have rented a guest house from Sohus' mother at the time. The same man later tried to sell witnesses anÂ Oriental rug that appeared to have a bloody stain on it, according to the Los Angeles Times, and had the victim's truck after his death. One piece of Sohus' body was found in a plastic bag stamped with the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. Gerhartsreiter studied at the university during the time that that logo was in use. This week the court heard testimony from a girlfriend who lived in New York with Gerhartsreiter during the late 1980s that he acted bizarreÂ when a police officer attempted to contact him about the murder. Gerhartsreiter â€” then living as Christopher Crowe â€” apparently dyed his hair black and his eyebrows blonde. Gerhartsreiter's ex-wife, Boss, is expected to testify in the case, which may well bring out more details. Gerhartsreiter may never testify in the trial himself â€” defense lawyers are refusing to say if he will or not, according to the Boston Herald â€” so jurors were shownÂ an August 2008 interview of Christian Gerhartsreiter on NBC's "Today", wherein he offers an oblique denial. The denial comes around 11 minutes into the video below, but the entire interview is fascinating to watch â€” for example, the moment whereÂ Gerhartsreiter puts on a Scottish accent and recites Robert Burns.  One big problem with the murder case is that events took place so long ago, at least two witnesses have failed to recognize Gerhartsreiter in court, the Los Angeles Times reports, and a lot of the evidence in the case is circumstantial at best. Gerhartsreiter's defense rests upon pointing the blame towards John Sohus' wife Linda, arguing that she was more physically capable of killing her husband in such a violent manner (at 6 feet tall, Linda was almost a foot taller than Gerhartsreiter). While nearly everyone agrees that Gerhartsreiter is an unusual guy, convicting him of murder may be a much harder task.
Getty ImagesWe're going to need a bigger acronym. In the beginning, it was just the "Greek debt crisis". Then markets realized Portugal, Ireland, Italy, and Spain were in bad shape too, and the PIIGS (or GIIPS) were born. But now Cyprus and Slovenia have run into trouble as well, giving us the ... SIC(K) PIGS? At this rate, we're going to have to buy a vowel soon, assuming Estonia doesn't end up needing a bailout. The euro crisis is entering its fourth year, and, sorry world, this won't be its last. Now, its long periods of boredom have gotten a bit longer, and its moments of sheer financial terror a bit less terrifying, ever since the European Central Bank (ECB) promised to do "whatever it takes" to save the common currency. But, as Cyprus and Slovenia show, the battle for the euro isn't over yet. Not even close. Here's the Cliff Notes version of the euro crisis. The euro zone doesn't have the fiscal or banking unions it needs to make monetary union work, and it's not close to changing that. In the meantime, the euro's continuing flaws continue to suck countries into crisis. And their politics get radicalized. Most recently, Cyprus was forced to accept a bailout and bail-in, because its too-big-to-save banks made some horrendously bad bets on Greek bonds. Slovenia looks like it could next on the euro-bailout tour, because, as Dylan Matthews of the Washington Post points out, its too-big-to-save-ish banks made some horrendously bad bets on its own companies. Now, banks make bad bets all the time, but those bad bets can bankrupt you as a country if you don't have your own central bank. Like euro countries. Of course, this "diabolic loop" between weak banks and weak sovereigns isn't the only problem in euroland. The common currency has plenty of other flaws. Here's why the euro, as it's currently constructed, is a doomsday device for mass bankruptcy. (How's that for solidarity?). 1. Too Tight Money The euro zone isn't what economists call an "optimal currency area". In other words, it was a bad idea. Its different members are different enough that they should have different monetary policies. But they don't. They have the ECB setting a single policy for all 17 of them. That's a particular problem for southern Europe now, because their wages are uncompetitively high relative to northern European ones, and the ECB isn't helping them out. There are two ways to fix this intra-euro competitiveness gap. Either northern European wages rise faster than normal while southern wages stay flat, or northern European wages grow normally while southern European wages fall. It's the difference between a bit more inflation or not -- in other words, between looser ECB policy or the status quo. Now, it might not sound like it really matters which option they choose, but it very much does. Falling wages make it harder to pay back debts that don't fall, setting off a vicious circle into economic oblivion. The ECB apparently prefers pushing more and more countries into oblivion with too tight money than risk anything resembling more inflation. 2. Too Tight Budgets Austerity has been a complete disaster. It's actually increased debt burdens across southern Europe, because it's reduced growth more than it's reduced borrowing costs. And now northern Europe is getting in on the act. France (which is really somewhere in between "southern" and "northern") just missed its deficit target, and is set to slash more; the Netherlands has put through contentious tax hikes and spending cuts, even as its economy has shrunk; and even Germany is contemplating new budget-saving measures. In other words, the euro has become an austerity suicide pact.3. Too Little Trade Excluding Germany, just over half of all euro trade is with each other. But with bad policy pushing southern Europe into depression and northern Europe towards recession, euro zone countries can't afford to buy as much stuff from each other. That adds a degree of difficulty to recovery for southern European countries that need to export their way out of trouble. As you can see in the chart below from Eurostat, intra-euro zone trade has stagnated the past few years after rebounding from its post-crash depths. The euro zone's weak links are dragging the rest down -- but only because the rest refuse to pull the weak ones up. The Atlantic 4. Too Much Financial Interconnection Other country's problems can quickly become your own if your banks own their bonds. Especially if your banks are bigger than your economy. That's the lesson Cyprus learned the very hard way after its banks loaded up on Greek debt in 2010, only to get wiped out a year later. The Financial Times has a great infographic (that you should play around with) on which country's banks are exposed to which other country's debt across the euro zone. As you can see below, any kind of Italian restructuring would be tremendously bad for French banks. The Atlantic The euro is the gold standard minus the shiny rocks. Both force countries to give up their ability to fight recessions in return for fixed exchange rates and open capital flows. But giving up the ability to fight recessions just makes it easier for recessions to turn into depressions. And that puts all of the pressure on wages to adjust down when a shock hits -- the most painful and destructive way of doing things.But the gold standard had an even bigger design flaw than creating depressions. That was perpetuating depressions. Under the rules of the game, countries short on gold were supposed to raise interest rates, which would push down wages, and push up exports. More exports would mean more gold, and then lower interest rates. But there was an asymmetry. Countries needed gold to create money, but countries didn't need to create money if they had gold. During the Great Depression, the U.S. and France sucked up most of the world's gold, but didn't turn it into money out of fear of nonexistent inflation. Countries that needed gold needed to push down wages even more to make their exports competitive -- not that there were any booming markets for them to export to due to the self-inflicted economics wounds of the U.S. and France. Instead, the depression just fed on itself. The euro suffers from a similar asymmetry. Debtor-euro countries are to cut wages and deficits, but creditor-euro countries aren't forced to increase wages and deficits. Perversely, the opposite. In other words, northern Europe isn't doing enough to offset the demand destruction in southern Europe. And it's sinking them all. Even worse, this slow-motion collapse is turning loans that would have otherwise been good into losses -- losses that force bailouts and faster collapses. But, to be clear, this isn't only a problem for the periphery. As the U.S. and France found out in the 1930s, it's generally not a good idea to force your customers into bankruptcy. That just creates depression without end -- until the gold (or euro) standard ends. It's no coincidence that the countries that ditched the gold standard first recovered from the Great Depression first. History doesn't need to repeat, or even rhyme. Europe doesn't have to keep crucifying itself on a cross of euros, the gold standard of the 21st-century. The euro's northern bloc could decide to let the ECB do more. Or it could decide to start spending more. Or not. Eurocrats seem content to do just enough to keep everything from falling apart, and nothing more. It's one part inflationphobia, and another part strategy. Indeed, it's how they try to keep the pressure on the southern bloc to push through unpopular labor market reforms. But doing enough today eventually won't be enough tomorrow if the southern bloc doesn't have any hope of recovering within the euro. The politics will turn against the common currency long before that. By that point, Europe won't need an acronym anymore. 
REUTERS/Yannis BehrakisThe deal has been struck, and now, Cypriots say, the betrayal is sinking in. Nick Squires reports on how the islanders are goin to need the luck of the gods to avoid plunging off an economic cliff. As she counts another day's paltry takings and frets about how to pay the rent, Dimitra Charilaou knows she is a tiny cog in the machine that drives Cyprus's once thriving economy. She owns a small hole-in-the-wall electrical supplies shop squeezed between a kebab joint and a dodgy-looking nightclub adorned with photos of blonde East European women in the old town of Nicosia, the island's capital. But multiply her predicament by 850,000 â€“ the population of this former British colony - and it is clear that the island that claims to be the birthplace of Aphrodite, and which has streets named after Greek heroes like Odysseus, is going to need the luck of the gods to avoid plunging off an economic cliff in the wake of last week's controversial bailout deal. Picking out a â‚¬10 note from her cash till, Mrs Charilaou, 59, told The Sunday Telegraph: "This is what I've earned today. My rent is â‚¬500 a month, how am I going to pay it? The retail business is bleeding, everybody is shutting down. "Today it's Cyprus, tomorrow it will be Italy. It will be a domino effect. We use to live peacefully, we had jobs. Now they have changed our lives." Last week the sun shone over Nicosia, whose old town is a tangled warren of narrow lanes, Byzantine churches and colonial bungalows with wooden verandas. But dark economic clouds are looming over Cyprus in the wake of the bail-out struck with Brussels, in which the country's two biggest banks are to be restructured and depositors hit with a "levy" of up to 80 per cent of their savings above â‚¬100,000. In a move that was seen to have crossed the Rubicon regarding the guarantee of savings within the eurozone, customers have had their accounts frozen; exactly when their money will be confiscated in the "haircut", as it is euphemistically known, is expected to be announced this week. So far there has been none of the violence that has hit neighbouring Greece, where masked protesters hurling stones have frequently clashed with riot police shooting tear gas in cities like Athens and Thessaloniki. Conventional wisdom has it that Cypriots are more restrained than their Greek cousins â€“ calmer and more "British" in fact, reflecting their 80-year history as one of the strategic lynchpins of the Empire, before they gained independence in 1960. But there are fears that all that could change and that some Cypriots could suddenly snap when they realise just how grim their future looks, as the financial and banking sector withers, the economy contracts by up to a quarter and unemployment soars to 25 per cent. "I wouldn't be surprised if someone took a gun and went after whoever is responsible for all this," said Marios Georgiou, a 45-year-old civil servant who stands to lose 40 to 50 per cent of his savings, held in the two banks targeted in the bail-out, Laiki and Bank of Cyprus. "I ask you, is this fair? Is this legal? It cannot be. People can't believe it. We have been in a struggle with the Turks for 40 years, but it took the EU just one day to come here and take all our money." Sipping a coffee at a bar between tourist boutiques selling postcards and sunglasses, Kyriacos Loizides, 53, a businessman, said: "Next week there will be huge demonstrations. I think there will be violence and killings. People will take revenge against the people who created this scandal, this tragedy. "Cyprus will become like Greece, where people throw yoghurt and tomatoes at politicians whenever they see them. We feel that soon everybody will be beggars here." The stories of financial ruin have been trickling out all week â€“ the elderly man who emigrated to Australia, worked hard for 35 years and now faces losing almost all of the â‚¬800,000 nest-egg he deposited in a Cypriot bank on his return; the wholesaler who was unable to pay the â‚¬1 million needed for a huge consignment of seafood fish that arrived in the port of Limassol, and which ended up rotting on the dockside. A drastic reform of the banking system was the condition imposed by the troika of international lenders â€“ the European Bank, the European Commission and the IMF â€“ in exchange for granting Cyprus â‚¬10 billion in emergency funding. The deal, hammered out during marathon talks with Nicos Anastasiades, the newly-elected president of Cyprus, averted the risk of the country going bankrupt and crashing out of the euro. But Cypriots feel it was a betrayal by their EU partners and reserve particular opprobrium for Germany's Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and its finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble. Berlin is being widely blamed for wanting to impose its standards of fiscal austerity and probity on Cyprus and of trialling a debt reduction model that could be applied to other struggling countries along the Mediterranean littoral. One Cypriot newspaper said the troika had "pillaged our economy and desecrated our sovereignty", while another railed against "the EU vultures". "Mrs Merkel and Dr Schauble decreed that the Cyprus economic model was not acceptable," Jim Leontiades, an analyst, wrote in the Financial Mirror, a Cypriot newspaper. "No other eurozone country has been required to remodel itself and destroy its main industry." Germany, for its part, was reluctant to spend taxpayers' money on bailing out the large number of Russians who had money in Cyprus's banks, some of it from shady provenance. But the introduction of the capital controls was unprecedented in the 14-year history of the euro, with analysts saying that it was the sort of thing that usually happened in Africa or Latin America. "It's criminal, what they have done," said Carmen, 34, a Romanian businesswoman who has lived in Cyprus for two years. "Never have I heard of a country robbing its citizens' bank accounts like this. There will be trouble for the government over this. If you live by fire, you die by fire." Facing a drastic contraction of the economy, many Cypriots say their only hope now is the development of huge reserves of natural gas which were found beneath the seabed of the island's exclusive economic zone, two years ago. In the bars and coffee shops of Nicosia, where locals puff on hookah pipes packed with fragrant tobacco, there is constant talk that the billions of euros to be earned from the gas could be the salvation of Cyprus. But exploration is still at an early stage and the gas may not come on tap until 2018 or 2019. And exploiting it will only exacerbate Cyprus's already tense relations with Turkey and the northern, Turkish-occupied portion of this divided island. Cyprus has been split since Turkey invaded the north in 1974, after an attempted coup in the Greek part of the island raised fears in Ankara that the island was about to unify with Greece. Hopes of a breakthrough in peace talks in 2004 were dashed after Greek Cypriots rejected a peace plan brokered by then-UN Secretary General Kofi Annan. Turkey is deeply unhappy about the prospect of Cyprus exploiting the gas without its consent, saying that the resources also belong to Turkish Cypriots. It also lays claim to parts of Cyprus's EEZ. "It is not acceptable that the Greek Cypriot side uses the economic crisis it is facing as an opportunity to create a new fait accompli," the Turkish foreign ministry said in a recent statement. The only acceptable way to exploit the reserves was with "the clear consent of the Turkish Cypriot side regarding the sharing of these natural resources." In Nicosia, there are daily reminders of the tensions with the Turks. The UN-administered "Green Line" splits the city in two, making it the last divided capital in the world. The sound of the muezzin call to prayer can easily be heard in the Greek half of the city, mosques and minarets loom just across the rooftops and a giant Turkish Cypriot flag has been etched in red and white into a nearby mountain side. Wander through the Greek Cypriot part of the old town in any direction and within 10 minutes your path will be blocked by sand bags, razor wire and barricades made of oil drums filled with concrete. Bored soldiers with automatic rifles man squat military bunkers. Painted in the blue and white of the Greek flag, they look out onto a scruffy no man's land towards the other side of the Green Line, where the flags of Turkey and the self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus flutter in the wind. In the dead ground in between there are shattered houses and shops, their walls pockmarked with bullet holes, their wooden shutters fading in the sun. Here, time has stood still since 1974. Some Cypriots see the crippling bail-out deal as a deliberate attempt by the EU to weaken them and drive them to the negotiating table with the Turkish-occupied part of the island, to try to solve the 40-year dispute once and for all. "There are ulterior motives at work here â€“ other countries want to get their hands on our oil and gas," said Miltos, a 34-year old businessman who was waiting anxiously for the island's banks to open on Thursday after being shut for 10 days to avoid a massive exodus of funds. "We have a loan we can't repay. We are going deeper and deeper into the hole. So we'll have to sell our only remaining asset â€“ the oil and gas. "Cyprus is small, the EU can use us as a guinea pig. They can rape our resources and force us to accept any plan for reunification." Cypriots admit that they are partly to blame for the mess they find themselves in. The country put too much reliance on its burgeoning financial services sector and its banks were heavily exposed to debt in Greece. Islanders have been living beyond their means for years, said Mr Loizides, the businessman in Nicosia. "But a lot of it was the banks' fault. A bank called me a while back and said they could offer me a â‚¬6,000 overdraft and â‚¬5,000 on my credit card. I hadn't even asked for it." As Mrs Charilaou contemplated a tough time for her electronics shop, she learnt that a pharmacy just round the corner is to close this weekend. "They had been in business for 50 years," she said. "A friend of mine who worked there for 35 years is in tears. We are a laughing people but I'm afraid that we are going to forget how to laugh." 
Christina Avraam If you haven't had a chance to read it yet, take some time this weekend to glance at Â Matthew Boesler's interview with Bernd Lucke, the German professor who is is leading an insurgent movement called Alternative fÃ¼r Deutschland (Alternative For Germany) which advocates an end to the Eurozone. A key part of Lucke's argument is that the euro must be sacrificed to save the greater European project (the European Union), as the status quo is tearing apart the continent. APThis line from Lucke is critical: We think that the euro currently splits the European Union into two parts ãƒ¼ a segment of an economically unsuccessful southern part, and a more northern, or more central, European part, which currently seems to benefit from the misery of the southern European countries, because all of the capital flows back from southern Europe to Germany, and the Netherlands, and other stable countries, where it helps us to do cheap investment, but which is at the expense of those southern European countries, and which certainly is the cause for envious sentiment and angry sentiment in the southern European countries, so that the political tensions within the European Union actually rise. It's hard to disagree with much that Lucke has to say. For one thing, all you have to do is look at the gigantic split that's opened up between German unemployment and unemployment in the rest of the Eurozone to see why there's so much anger about the status quo. Danske Bank And as Paul Krugman observed this week, the European economic crisis now represents a bigger disaster than the Great Depression in terms of the trajectory of GDP per capita.  The Great Depression ended as countries took themselves off of the gold standard. The European crisis may only end when countries take themselves off of the modern equivalent, the inflexible currency.
Lucke, the leader of Alternative für Deutschland, is on board with the "new approach" the euro zone appears to be taking with bank bailouts in the wake of this week's Cyprus deal that has sent bank stocks in Italy and Spain tumbling. Depositors in the two largest Cypriot banks will take a substantial haircut on bank account balances in excess of 100,000 euros in order to help pay for the bailout. This shifts the burden of footing the bill away from the taxpayers and onto those involved directly with the banks. Germany, the kingmaker in the euro zone, pushed hard for the EU to take a hard line with Cyprus, ensuring that depositors would be involved in the restructuring. After all, with elections looming in September, the last thing German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her party needs is to look like they are willing to write blank checks to Cypriot banks, which are viewed by the international community as an offshore tax haven for moneyed Russian interests. Lucke says the reason Germany had to take such a hard line toward depositors – a stance that has set in motion a whole new disruptive chain of events in the euro zone in recent weeks – was because of the new dynamic his party has brought to the German political scene. "My sentiment is that this is a response to the fact that our party has gone public and that Angela Merkel feels threatened and now fights back for her popular support," Lucke told Business Insider. So, what exactly is Alternative's plan for Germany and the euro? For Germany, it's severing the fiscal transfers to struggling peripheral euro zone countries in southern Europe that have fallen into recession. "While it currently seems to be the case that we do benefit from the euro crisis, there are tremendous risks in the wings, and we would like to end these policies of disguising fiscal risk, and discharging banks of their risk to the detriment of taxpayers," says Lucke. "This heavy burden we just do not want to bear, and this is why we have formed our party to oppose it." For the rest of Europe, in which Germany remains dominant, it's dissolving the euro altogether. Lucke says the economic division the euro is creating between North and South "certainly is the cause for envious sentiment and angry sentiment in the southern European countries, so that the political tensions within the European Union actually rise." Alternative für Deutschland fears that these tensions could jeopardize the principles of a "common market" that make the EU so great for German trade. Lucke suggests, for example, that peripheral nations could perhaps impose customs duties if they can find no other way to become competitive. "We use the completely wrong incentives for the crisis countries," says Lucke. "We do not help them solve their problems, but pile up more debt for them and force them into a recession, which makes the situation simply unsustainable." Thus, it's about sacrificing the euro to save the European Project. We also spoke to Lucke about AfD's chances in September's elections, what an AfD opposition would look like in the German Bundestag, his thoughts on the rise of Beppe Grillo and the anti-euro Five Star Movement in Italy, and the economics Germany's relationship with the euro. The full transcript is included below. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BUSINESS INSIDER: What is your opinion of how Angela Merkel has handled the Cypriot bank bailout? APBERND LUCKE: I think it was a stupid idea of hers to try to use the savings of smaller savers with credits in the bank of less than 100,000 euros for bailing out the Cypriot banks. This was against European law, as everybody knows, so by doing that, she has caused a very aggressive climate in Cyprus, which made it much more difficult to find public support for the one step which was right, which was correct, which is to use some of the wealth of the big creditors of Cypriot banks to stabilize the banking system there. So, I do approve of the decision the Cypriot parliament has taken with respect to wealth beyond 100,000 euros. I think this is a good and necessary step. I do not approve, however, of the fact that the bailout clause of the Maastricht Treaty has again been violated by the promise of another 10 billion euros for the Cypriot government. BI: Do you think the rise of Alternative für Deutschland pressured the Merkel government to take a harder line with Cyprus? BL: It seems that the German government has been rather tough in recent weeks on the government of Cyprus, and my sentiment is that this is a response to the fact that our party has gone public and that Angela Merkel feels threatened and now fights back for her popular support. BI: Eurogroup President Jeroen Dijsselbloem this week sparked some controversy by suggesting that the Cypriot bank bailout deal could be a template for future bank restructurings in the euro area. How would a Germany led by your party seek to guide the restructuring process? BL: I think that the restructuring of banks is necessary in many circumstances. I am very much in favor of having an orderly sovereign default in those countries which are overly indebted. An orderly default means that while the government does default, it is necessary to stabilize banks, and if banks are being recapitalized, then I think the prime resource for recapitalizing banks are the owners and the large creditors of those banks. So, I am very much in favor, actually, of the policy that has already been outlined this week. BI: Germany has managed to avoid recession, and unemployment continues to fall. Why would you want to endanger that status quo by leaving the euro? BL: There is a huge build-up of fiscal risk in Germany by the obligations which we have agreed to under the European Stabilization Mechanism. So, while it currently seems to be the case that we do benefit from the euro crisis, there are tremendous risks in the wings, and we would like to end these policies of disguising fiscal risk, and discharging banks of their risk to the detriment of taxpayers. We think that the tensions in the euro zone, which are currently just hidden by those transfer payments we make, should be made visible and should be solved by reintroducing national currencies and exchange rate flexibility. This may, in the short run, put some burden on the German economy as well, but I think in the long run, it will be much more beneficial than the current policy. BI: What is the real downside to continued wealth transfers from Germany and other northern euro member states to those on the periphery? BL: Well, I don't really see that those economies are coming back on track. What we see currently is a steep rise in unemployment and youth unemployment in the southern European countries. We do observe some improvement in the terms of current account deficits and measures of productivity, but these are an improvement only because unemployment is rising – because less productive workers have been fired. So, I do not think that this does indicate any kind of real progress, or at least enough progress to make those countries competitive again. The problem seems to be that we have started with a transfer union, and there is no way out that we currently see as long as we stay in the euro. Rather, it seems that this policy will linger on for years, and possibly decades, which will put a heavy burden on German taxpayers, households, as well as enterprises. This heavy burden we just do not want to bear, and this is why we have formed our party to oppose it. BI: What is your response to the rise of Beppe Grillo and his anti-euro, Five Star Movement in Italy? BL: I don't really have any response to that – I observe this rise, but we do not have any contact with his party. I do share some of his views that the euro is not the appropriate currency for Italy. So, I have some sympathy for some of his positions, but certainly not for all of his positions, and certainly not necessarily for the way he is advancing his positions. So, I think there are also big differences between our party and Grillo's party. BI: Does Alternative advocate that Germany should leave the euro? BL: No. We are running on a platform to dissolve the euro in a stepwise fashion, on a platform which proposes to reintroduce national currencies, but not by having Germany leave the euro, but rather by making the southern European countries leave the euro first, and then breaking up the remaining euro zone into other smaller currency areas, or into countries which each have their own national currency. What we do not propose is that Germany leave the euro either now or in the future in any kind of unilateral sense. BI: What do you hope to achieve going into the September elections? What sort of ground can you reasonably hope to gain in the government? BL: Opinion polls currently indicate that about 25 percent of the German population is sympathetic to our anti-euro view, so we hope, of course, to take advantage of this share of the population as much as is possible. If we do get elected to parliament, then the next question is whether we will be in the opposition there, or whether we will join other forces to form a government. My guess is that we will be an opposition party, because we would be willing to cooperate with any other party only if it changes its view on euro policy, and this is currently not conceivable. BI: How have relatively calm financial markets in Europe since last summer affected the German perception of the euro and "bailout fatigue" in the German population? BL: I think that the unrest which the public feels has grown, even though I also believe that there was a big share of the population that was displeased with Angela Merkel's policies already from the start of this policy in May 2010 on. You may remember that Angela Merkel's party suffered heavy, heavy losses in regional elections which immediately followed the decision of May 2010 to establish the first big rescue facility. So, there is a large share of the population which is deeply displeased with that, which perhaps has not really had the means to express itself properly, because many people are not so familiar with economics, and don't feel on safe grounds when they speak about that topic. It is precisely for this reason that we have formed our party now, which is supported by many, many professors of economics, for instance, and many entrepreneurs for whom it is their daily bread to deal with economic issues, and which are quite outspoken in their criticism toward the government's euro policies. BI: How has your background informed your views on the euro and Alternative's euro policy platform? BL: I think there are basically two sources. One source is that i do not see much support for the economics behind the rescue policies. We have a big misallocation of capital by the rescue facilities. We use the completely wrong incentives for the crisis countries. We do not help them solve their problems, but pile up more debt for them and force them into a recession, which makes the situation simply unsustainable. So, there is a lot of economics which can actually be advanced against current policies. The second source of my thinking was sort of more democratic or legalistic way of thinking in the sense that I was shocked by the fact that our government does not respective the Treaty of Maastricht. It just acts as it pleases in certain circumstances, completely disregarding all the promises which ever have been made to German voters, completely disregarding the legal framework of the European Union. This, I think, is something which is really shameful for a democratic society, and is also a major source for my political engagement. BI: What are your views toward the European Union? BL: We do think that this is the way to save the European Union from a breakup. Actually, this is a big concern that we have. We think that the euro currently splits the European Union into two parts – a segment of an economically unsuccessful southern part, and a more northern, or more central, European part, which currently seems to benefit from the misery of the southern European countries, because all of the capital flows back from southern Europe to Germany, and the Netherlands, and other stable countries, where it helps us to do cheap investment, but which is at the expense of those southern European countries, and which certainly is the cause for envious sentiment and angry sentiment in the southern European countries, so that the political tensions within the European Union actually rise. There is the imminent danger of the disintegration of the European Union and of the common market, possibly even with a return to, say, impediments to trade, like a reintroduction of customs duties if those southern European countries are not able to balance their trade by any other means – in particular, not able to balance their trade by a devaluation of their own currency. BI: Is Alternative's plan to sacrifice the euro in order to save the European Project? BL: That would be absolutely correct.
From Paul Krugman: The trajectory of Europe's real GDP per capita today vs. its real GDP per capita back during The Great Depression. No commentary necessary. Paul Krugman (Via @brianmlucey)
Europe should be really happy that March is over. It was a disastrous month. There were three main stories; all of them bad. Italy can't form a government. Italy's parliamentary election took place at the end of February, and it was immediately clear that no single party won enough seats in both houses of Parliament to be able to form a government. Center-left candidate Pier Luigi Bersani had the best shot of establishing a coalition, but he was unable to come to any deals with Berlusconi's party, and he was unable to pick away any support from Beppe Grillo's Five-Star party, and bring them over to his side. That all came to a head at the end of this past week. The ball has now been thrown into the court of Italian President Napolitano (a separate position than PM, who serves a seven-year term, and whose job it is to facilitate the establishment of a government). Another election this year looks very likely. Since the February election, there have been polls in Italy showing strength for Berlusconi and Beppe Grillo, so if there were another election there's a good shot that the winner would be someone who doesn't have the same inclination to play nice with the rest of the Eurozone. Cyprus. This was a fiasco on so many levels. The amount of money involved was almost totally irrelevant â€” couch change for Germany. But because of how the situation was handled, Eurozone leaders managed to reignite fears of a euro breakup, create uncertainty over the safety of retail bank deposits all over Europe, violate the notion of insured deposits, anger the Russians, anger the Greeks, create dissent between the IMF and the EU, and make it look like Germany is a huge bully that creates the policy for all Eurozone members. And in the wake of Cyprus, Europe can not get its story straight about whether the Cyprus model of resolving banks is a precedent, a template, a blueprint, or none of the above. Complete disaster. The economy is a trainwreck. This is really the big one. The European economy is really going to crap again. We'll find out more soon, as we get PMI numbers for March on Monday, but we already know how bad the month was. Flash PMI numbers for France and Germany were awful. The Citi Eurozone Economic Surprise Index (which measures the strength of the data relative to expectations) absolutely PLUMMETED in March. Big thanks to @guan for putting the chart together for me. Thomson Reuters/@guan So the economy just got completely taken to the woodshed in March in the Eurozone. And that's going to make everything else worse. Deficit targets will be missed. Voters will be more radicalized, and so on. March was a truly horrible month for Europe.
Business periodicals get a bad wrap for making market calls. However, Barron's continues to be unapologetically bullish. In this week's magazine, Randall Forsyth reviews how the Dow and S&amp;P 500 marched to all-time highs despite the uncertain backdrop. And his ultimate message is to stay bullish. All of which shows it doesn't pay to worry about such things as fiscal drag, the inevitable rise in interest rates, the ever-more precarious situation in Europe, and the uncertain outlook in China. Indeed, these are reasons to be bullish. With risks abroad and interest rates near zero, it's been dubbed a TINA market -- as in There Is No Alternative to U.S. stocks as a place to store your money. Forsyth argues we can ignore recent tax hikes and budget cuts.  He also argues that a break-up of the euro zone would be bullish as investors would likely shift there assets to the U.S.  Furthermore, bonds continue to be an unattractive place to be, which leads him to the Federal Reserve: By Wilshire Associates' estimates, U.S. stocks have increased by $1.9 trillion in value so far this year while the Fed has increased its holdings by some $274 billion. At a $1 billion annual pace of purchases, just think what Bernanke &amp; Co. can accomplish. Clearly, we can print our way to prosperity.

AP ImagesA woman sweeps the ground while people wait outside a branch of Bank of Cyprus in Nicosia, Cyprus, Thursday, March 28, 2013. This piece from Ambrose Evans-Pritchard is about as hard-hitting an analysis of Cyprus as I have read and really makes an interesting introduction to this weekâ€™s Outside the Box. No messing around: Capital controls have shattered the monetary unity of EMU. A Cypriot euro is no longer a core euroâ€¦. The complicity of EU authorities in the original plan to violate insured bank savings â€“ halted only by the revolt of the Cypriot parliament â€“ leaves the suspicion that they will steal anybodyâ€™s money if leaders of the creditor states think it is in their immediate interest to do so. The IMF doesnâ€™t get off easy here, either: The IMFâ€™s Christine Lagarde has given her blessing to the Troika deal, claiming that the package will restore Cyprus to full health, with public debt below 100pc of GDP by 2020. Yet the Fund has already been through this charade in Greece, and her own staff discredited the doctrine behind EMU crisis measures. It has shown that the â€œfiscal multiplierâ€ is three times higher than thought for the Club Med bloc. Austerity beyond the therapeutic dose is self-defeating. I want to amplify Ambroseâ€™s comments by excerpting from another piece, by my Ã¼ber-liberal friend Yves Smith over at Naked Capitalist (although she might characterize herself as mainstream reasonable). But we share a healthy skepticism of large banks. As we say in Texas, it ainâ€™t over till the fat lady sings. And that would be Italy, as Ambrose points out. (Which given the original intent of that quote and that Darrel Royal of the University of Texas (way back in the day) was referring to Opera Italiana, it is appropriate â€“ in fact,Â we said it first!) I have been spending a few moments here and there the last few days with my new granddaughter, Addison (and her parents). Iâ€™m now officially in a hotel room in Dallas for the duration until we can get the new place actually bought and construction done, which at best will be late summer; but I will be traveling a lot anyway the next three months, so itâ€™s just another hotel room. I am using it as an opportunity to learn minimalist living. But I am having to become acquainted with a new knowledge domain, that of architecture and design. If I was just looking at another fund or investment manager, I would feel pretty comfortable doing it on my own, but I clearly need help here and no shame in admitting it. Many of you may be in a similar boat when it comes to investing. You can leave it to the professionals entirely, but then you get the results that they design and not maybe what you really want. It works a lot better if you spend some time getting familiar with the rules and communicating your objectives. Most of you would not think (or your wives would not!) of building a home without a great deal of input. Someone has to learn that language if you want to have something that really works for your situation and budget. The same is true of investing. It is a knowledge domain that is unfamiliar to many, but it is critical to your future happiness. You really do need to get the basics down. The more you learn the better off you will be. And using professionals is important â€“ unless you are going to spend a whole lot of time learning the rules and the tricks. In fact, it takes more than a minor investment of time and effort just to develop adequate skill to be able to pick the right professionals. Not all investment â€œdesignersâ€ are the same level of expertise or appropriate for what you want and need. I did a lot of construction as a young man and can understand the basics even today. But I was never skilled enough to do finish work or design. We will see if I can learn enough to pick the right team in short order! Thankfully, most of you have more time to choose investment professionals. Have a great Easter weekend. I see more family coming my way and maybe Mavericks and Stars games in our future.

Flickr / fairfaxcountyWorkers of all ages continue to feel the effects of the global recession, especially recent college graduates who have struggled to find jobs and cash-strapped baby boomers who lack sufficient retirement savings. There is a widely held perception that the two groups are fighting for a single scarce commodity: jobs. While some evidence suggests that young workers sometimes have trouble competing directly with older, more experienced workers for low-skilled jobs, most economists agree that 20-somethings would not have an easier time joining the workforce if older workers moved out of the way. In fact, a higher number of older workers in the labor force actually seems to improve young workers’ prospects. The so-called “lump of labor” theory, in which older and younger workers are competing for a fixed number of jobs, certainly did not hold true in the United States during the Great Recession, according to a recent report by The Pew Charitable Trusts’ Economic Mobility Project entitled, “When Baby Boomers Delay Retirement, Do Younger Workers Suffer?” “Every which way that it was analyzed, the authors found that … when older workers are employed at higher rates, the young workers are also employed at higher rates,” said Diana Elliott, the project’s research manager. Baby Boomers Create Jobs  Andrew Sum, the director of Northeastern University’s Center for Labor Market Studies, said older workers do keep younger workers out of some low-skilled jobs, such as fast-food and restaurant workers, greeters at chain stores, grocery store baggers and even some construction and office workers. “If you take a look at the industries where the jobs were lost, you generally find many more older workers working in jobs that used to go to teenagers, especially, and young adults,” he said. “That’s been going on for the past decade.” Older workers have also been staying longer in the workforce since the late 1990s, Sum said. A marked decline in retirement savings is partly responsible – many people keep working simply because they can’t afford to stop. But a look at the economy as a whole, rather than at low-skilled jobs in particular, shows that higher employment among older workers seems to correlate with more – and better-paying – jobs for younger workers. A 1 percent increase in the employment rate of baby boomers over the age of 55 was associated with a 0.28 percent rise in the youth hourly wage rate, according to the Pew study. Even when the authors looked at employment trends dating back to 1977, taking into account differences in demographics, nature of employment and labor market conditions between states, the findings were similar. Youth employment rose by 0.21 percentage points when the employment rate among older workers increased by 1 percentage point. “This really suggests a larger labor market phenomenon,” Elliott said. “If the labor market is doing well, then everyone benefits.” The idea that boomers are crowding out younger workers persists partly because it makes intuitive sense, said Kevin Cahill, a research economist at the Sloan Center on Aging and Work at Boston College. If 10 workers were to leave a firm, that could open up spots for 10 others. But economies are driven by much more complex equations, he noted, with technological changes eliminating some jobs and creating others over time. What About Europe?  While a U.S. jobs recovery appears to be gaining traction, Europe is still struggling through a labor crisis that has hit younger workers particularly hard. Every fourth person between 15 and 24 is jobless in the European Union, Patrick De Maeseneire, the CEO of Adecco Group, a Zurich-based staffing company, told a Credit Suisse panel discussion at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January. Greece and Spain are the worst-hit countries, with youth unemployment hovering around 59.4 percent and 55.5 percent, respectively, according to Eurostat figures released this month. But the dynamic between younger and older workers appears to be the same in Europe as in the U.S. A 2009 study published by the New York-based National Bureau of Economic Research looked at employment trends in 12 countries, including France, Germany, Italy and Spain, and concluded that youth unemployment rates declined as higher proportions of older workers participated in the work force. That’s not to say the two generations face identical labor trends. Older workers in the U.S. are less likely to lose their jobs during and after a recession than their younger counterparts, partly due to workplace seniority rules, according to a brief by the Urban Institute’s Richard W. Johnson, which was published by The Russell Sage Foundation and The Stanford Center on Poverty and Inequality. But older workers who lose their jobs can expect to be unemployed for much longer than younger ones. In December 2012, the average period of unemployment for workers aged 55 and older was 51.3 weeks, compared with 34.3 weeks for other workers, Johnson’s brief said. A Boon to the Economy But all in all, far from slowing the economy, older workers delaying retirement are able to save more money, allow employers to draw from a larger pool of potential employees, and set more people to producing in the greater economy. Besides, if older employees didn’t want to work, middle-aged and younger people would have to support a growing section of society, Cahill said. And that, he warned, would present “a much bigger problem.”
Flickr / pageantcastThe S&amp;P 500 hit a new all-time closing high yesterday. The last time that happened was on October 9, 2007. You often hear about the best-performing stocks since the market hit its post-crash low in March 2009. But what about the stocks that have done the best since the last market top? Some of the names may surprise you, but several probably won't.
While inflation seems to be on everyoneâ€™s mind these days, misconceptions abound. Indeed, few concepts in economics are as misunderstood as inflation. This month I take a look at some common questions about inflation, and a few that I wish more people were asking. Is hyperinflation coming to the U.S.?No. Hyperinflation arises only under the most extreme conditions, such as war, political mismanagement, or the transition from a command economy to a market-based economy. If you compare the U.S. to countries that have experienced hyperinflationâ€“ think Iran, North Korea, Zimbabwe, and the former Yugoslavia, for example â€” the U.S. doesnâ€™t even come close. Hyperinflation begins when a country experiences an inflation rate of greater than 50% percent per month â€” which comes out to about 13,000% per year. Although it experienced elevated inflation around the time of the Revolution and the Civil War, the United States has never passed this magic mark. At present, the U.S. inflation rate, measured by the consumer price index (CPI), is less than 2% per year. So, to say that the U.S. is on its way to hyperinflation is just nonsense. But what about Quantitative Easing? Wonâ€™t that cause high inflation?No, at least not under the current QE program. What many people fail to understand is that the money created by the Fed, through programs like Quantitative Easing, is whatâ€™s known as â€œstate moneyâ€ (monetary base). In the U.S., this makes up only 15% of the money supply, broadly measured. The remainder is made up of â€œbank moneyâ€ â€” the all important portion of the money supply produced by banks, through deposit creation. So, while the Fed has more than tripled the supply of state money since the collapse of Lehman Brothers, in September 2008, this component of the money supply is still paltry compared to the total money supply. In fact, when measured broadly, using a Divisia M4 metric, the U.S. money supply is actually 6% below trend (see the accompanying chart). There are a number of factors that affect the growth of money, but there are two main factors that have hampered broad money growth in the United States since the financial crisis. Not surprisingly, they are both government created. The first is the squeeze that has been put on the banks, as a result of Dodd-Frank and Basel III capital-asset ratio hikes. By requiring banks to hold more capital per dollar of assets (read: loans), the regulators have put a constraint on bankâ€™s balance sheets, which limits their ability to lend. In consequence, money supply growth has been slower than it would have otherwise been. Cato Institute The other factor is the credit crunch created by the Fedâ€™s zero-interest-rate policy. This has dried up the interbank lending market, because banks have little financial incentive to lend to each other. Without a well-functioning interbank lending market to ensure balance sheet liquidity, banks have been unwilling to scale up or even retain their forward loan commitments. The end result is a loose state money/tight bank money monetary mix. And since bank money makes up 85% of the total, the money supply in the U.S. is still, on balance, tight and below trend. That said, the broad Divisia M4 measure of the money supply has started to show signs of life in recent months. Cato Institute How Can The Fed Avoid Inflation Going Forward?The Fed should start paying attention to the dollar. While operating under a regime of inflation targeting and a floating U.S. dollar exchange rate, Chairman Bernanke has seen fit to ignore fluctuations in the value of the dollar. Indeed, changes in the dollarâ€™s exchange value do not appear as one of the six metrics on â€œBernankeâ€™s Dashboardâ€ â€” the one the chairman uses to gauge the appropriateness of monetary policy. Perhaps this explains why Bernanke has been dismissive of questions suggesting that changes in the dollarâ€™s exchange value influence either commodity prices or more broad gauges of inflation. The relationship between the dollarâ€™s value and inflation has been abundantly clear for the last decade. As Nobelist Robert Mundell has convincingly argued, changes in exchange rates transmit inflation (or deflation) into economies, and they can do so rapidly. This relationship was particularly pronounced during the financial crisis (see the accompanying chart). Indeed, from 2007-09, the monthly year-over-year percent changes in the consumer price index and in the USD/EUR exchange rate have a correlation of 0.75. As can be seen in the chart, there is a roughly two-month lag between changes in the USD/EUR exchange rate and in the CPI; when we factor in this lag, the correlation strengthens to 0.94. By ignoring this, Bernanke was â€œflying blindâ€ in the initial months of the crisis. In consequence, the Fed failed to stabilize the USD/EUR exchange rate, which swung dramatically in the months surrounding the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Accordingly, the Fed acted too slowly in cutting the federal funds rate to stabilize inflation, which swung from an alarming rate of over 5% (year-over-year), to a negative (deflationary) rate in a matter of a few short months. If Bernanke had been monitoring the USD/EUR exchange rate, he would have realized that he was engaging in an ultra-tight monetary policy in the early months of the financial crisis. He would have known then to act much sooner than December 2008 â€” almost two months after the Lehman bankruptcy. Perhaps if he had tried to stabilize the value of the greenback, the bankruptcy may never have occurred in the first place. How Does the Value of the Dollar Influence Inflation?One important way the dollarâ€™s value affects inflation is through commodity prices. With few exceptions, when the dollar weakens against the euro, commodity prices soar, and when the dollar soars against the euro, commodity prices plunge. As every commodity trader knows, when the value of the dollar falls, the nominal dollar prices of internationally traded commodities â€” like gold, rice, corn and oil â€” must increase because more dollars are required to purchase the same quantity of any commodity. The linkage between the dollar-euro exchange rate and commodity prices is depicted in the accompanying chart. Cato Institute During the 2002â€“July 2008 period, the dollar declined steeply against the euro, and commodity prices surged. When the dollar subsequently rebounded, after Lehman Brothers collapsed, commodity prices tumbled. And again, following the first quarter of 2009, the renewed decline in the dollarâ€™s exchange rate brought with it another surge in commodity prices. We can see the consequences of this relationship in the lead-up to the 2008 financial crisis. During the five years preceding the Lehman Brothersâ€™ collapse, the Fedâ€™s favorite inflation target â€” the consumer price index, absent food and energy prices â€” was increasing at a regular, modest rate. But, this was an illusion. As can be seen in the accompanying chart, a weakening dollar drove up asset prices in the equities, commodities, and, of course, housing markets. Unbeknownst to the Fed, abrupt shifts in major relative prices were underfoot. For example, housing prices â€” measured by the Case-Shiller home price index â€” were surging, increasing by 45% from the first quarter in 2003 until their peak in the first quarter of 2006. Share prices were also on a tear, increasing by 66% from the first quarter of 2003 until they peaked in the first quarter of 2008. Cato Institute The most dramatic price increases were in the commodities, however. Measured by the Commodity Research Bureauâ€™s spot index, commodity prices increased by 92% from the first quarter of 2003 to their pre-Lehman Brothers peak in the second quarter of 2008.The dramatic jump in commodity prices was due, in large part, to the fact that a weak dollar accompanied the Fedâ€™s ultra-low interest rates. Measured by the Federal Reserveâ€™s Trade-Weighted Exchange Index for major currencies, the greenback fell in value by 30.5% from 2003 to mid-July 2008. For any economist worth his salt, these relative price changes should have set off alarm bells. Unfortunately, the Fedâ€™s CPI inflation metric signaled â€œno problemsâ€.How Does the Dollarâ€™s Value Affect the Global Economy? The dollar has become a staple currency for the invoicing of exports, and as a transaction currency in foreign exchange markets. For example, Australia, Korea, Thailand, and Malaysia all have over 70% of their exports invoiced in dollars, even though only 25% of their trade is with the United States. Indeed, in most countries, the share of exports invoiced in dollars is larger than the share of actual exports to the United Sates. Clearly, the dollar has become the â€œvehicleâ€ currency in international trade. Thus, the dollar dominates the international markets. But, what does this mean when the value of the dollar fluctuates? Well, because of this â€œdollar standardâ€, producer prices around the world all move in the opposite direction of the value of the dollar (see the accompanying chart). Indeed, since 2000, decreases in the value of the dollar have been clearly linked to increases in producer prices around the world. Given the recent loose talk of currency wars, it is little wonder that finance ministers in countries like China and Brazil are worried about a depreciating dollar affecting their producer prices, causing inflationary pressures. Cato Institute That said, the United States can only expect to stay insulated from elevated inflation in emerging markets for so long. Indeed, while the U.S. money supply remains under trend, leaving inflation in check (for now), we may see inflationary pressures begin to surface before long. That is, unless the greenback continues to finds renewed strength â€” which has been evident in recent months. What Can Be Done?When it comes to exchange rates, stability might not be everything, but everything is nothing without stability. The worldâ€™s two most important currencies â€” the dollar and the euro â€” should, via formal agreement, trade in a zone ($1.20 - $1.40 to the euro, for example). The European Central Bank would be obliged to maintain this zone of stability by defending a weak dollar (by purchasing dollars). Likewise, the Fed would be obliged to defend a weak euro (by purchasing euros). The East Asian dollar bloc, which was torpedoed during the 2003 Dubai Summit, should be resurrected â€” with the yuan and other Asian currencies tightly linked to the greenback. As for other countries (Brazil and Venezuela, for example), they should adopt currency boards, linked to either the dollar or euro. Or, they could simply â€œdollarizeâ€, by adopting a foreign currency (like the dollar, for example) as their own. Until we return to a stable, rule-bound international monetary system, inflation will continue to be source of anxiety in economies and asset markets around the world.This article appeared in the April 2013 issue of Globe Asia Magazine Â 
But in the book "Think, Act and Invest Like Warren Buffett,"Â which is illustrated by Carl Richards, Larry Swedroe says you indeed can invest like Buffett ãƒ¼ just not by stock-picking. Swedroe is a principal and director of research for the $18-billion St. Louis-based financial planning firm Buckingham Asset Management, LLC. An outspoken and passionate advocate of passive investing, Swedroe quotes an admonition Buffett gave in the 1993 Berkshire Hathaway annual report: â€œBy periodically investing in an index fund, the know-nothing investors can actually outperform most investment professionals.â€ Index-based investing is the thrust of Swedroeâ€™s message in this short book, which is written for clients and not advisors. Iâ€™ll review some of Swedroeâ€™s key tenets. First, letâ€™s look at what he said about how Buffett succeeds where virtually all others fail. Why individual investors arenâ€™t like Buffett Swedroe says retail investors invariably fail because they canâ€™t adhere to two of Buffettâ€™s basic rules: Donâ€™t listen to forecasts, and donâ€™t try to time the market. Buffett once said, â€œthe only value of stock forecasters is to make fortune-tellers look good.â€ Most investors would do better by ignoring investment advice offered by CNBC and similar outlets, Swedroe says, because it tells them nothing about where the market is headed. Research proves the fallibility of forecasters. Swedroe cites data from Philip Tetlock and William Sherden that show that no economic forecasters have established a consistent track record. The better-known forecasters have actually been the least accurate. Even government agencies such as the Federal Reserve Bank have not been any better at forecasting than random guesses. Many investors also try to time the market, despite warnings from Buffett. In regard to Berkshire Hathawayâ€™s investing strategy, Buffett has said that â€œour favorite holding period is foreverâ€ and that â€œinactivity strikes us as intelligent behavior.â€ Swedroe says investors lack the discipline and temperament to buy only when valuations are excessively low and sell when they are high. Emotions and the drone of CNBC get in the way, tempting investors to follow the herd and trade far too actively. As for the ability to pick stocks, Buffett has an edge that no investor can possess. Because of his size and stature, he is given opportunities that are unavailable to others. He was able to lend Goldman Sachs $5 billion in a preferred stock that earned 10 percent in 2008, when Goldman needed an investor of Buffettâ€™s stature. More recently, his purchase of H.J. Heinz included preferred shares with a 9 percent dividend. The average investor, according to Buffett and Swedroe, doesnâ€™t have similar opportunities on a risk-adjusted basis. They are best served through a passive strategy using index funds.
