Personal finance guru Dave Ramsey went on a rant Tuesday afternoon against Twitter users who assailed him for promising consumers they could become millionaires by saving $100 per month.  It's a formula Ramsey has touted for years, but he kicked off his morning by tweeting this nugget of wisdom out to more than 300,000 followers:  "Saving only $100 per month from age 25 to age 65 at 12% growth = $1,176,000. Everyone should retire a millionaire!" The backlash was instant and people had one main question: How can you promise a 12 percent return on investment over a 40-year period?  Ramsey defended himself during his live show Wednesday, calling the theory  "inspirational" and "instructional."  But for the legion of fans who eat up his every word each day, it could be the last kind of advice they need.  Here's where we take issue with Ramsey's defense:  Ramsey: "[I use this formula] to encourage you to save. That's why I would say it,  to encourage you to be an investor. It wasn't a political statement, although I'm not above those. It wasn't a spiritual statement, although I'm not above those. It was a mathematical formula showing that if you save money over time, you'll have some."  Our take: It's noble to want people to save. But, of course, anyone would be inspired to save if you tell them they could make a million bucks just by tucking away a small amount of cash for 40 years. The fact of the matter is that his formula relies on a 12 percent rate of investment return –– something no one in their right minds would promise for that long a time frame.  An August report by S&amp;P Indices found more than 80 percent of actively managed U.S. stock funds underperformed the market.  Yes, Ramsey went on to say that he "didn't bring up a guarantee," later, but there no was no such clarification in the original tweet. Why? The way Ramsey suggests earning that return is to invest in mutual funds (of course, he suggests listeners call his hotline for his personally-endorsed funds, but we'll get to that later). He says his team can point people to funds that have "lifetime track records of" 12 percent returns. We'd love to see the numbers to prove that.  According to a study published in the Journal of investing, 75% of investment funds under-perform the stock market averages over the long term. The reason? High fees, taxes and trading commissions that eat up all the profit, not that most mutual fund advisors will factor those costs into their annual return estimates.  The average mutual fund charges up to 3 percent of annual returns for the privilege of divvying up your investments, according to Forbes. That's the reason more conservative experts like U.S. News &amp; World Report's Kimberly Palmer use a 7 percent ROI when calculating a millionaire retirement goal: "If you start saving for retirement at age 25, you only have to save about $4,830 annually to reach $1 million by age 65, assuming an annual return of 7 percent after fees. If you wait until age 40 to start saving, you'll need to tuck away much more: $15,240 per year, assuming the same retirement age and annual return." Note: That's a monthly savings goal of $400/month, a far cry from the "coffee a day" $100 Ramsey estimates.  Ramsey: "Who could save $100 a month? People who work and stay out of debt and live on a budget. ...  You would have $100 if you would cut your freaking cable bill back, stay out of the coffee shop and quit spending money you don't have on a bunch of junk."  Our take: Certainly, it is possible for a lot of people to tuck away that much cash per month by rejiggering their expenditures. But what about the 132 million Americans who don't even have enough saved for emergencies?  We doubt they can afford luxuries like lattes and cable, let alone investing $100 in a costly mutual fund, especially given the fact that U.S. households saw their income decrease by $49,000 between 2007 and 2010, according to the NY Fed.  And the sarcastic, finger-wagging tone Ramsey uses to blast people who say they can't save is insulting and a little hypocritical –– Ramsey himself declared personal bankruptcy before building his personal finance empire.  Ramsey: "It's simple concept in a culture that has the savings rate and financial maturity of a two-year-old. To simply put out there that maybe if you save some money you would have some blows people away. This is why I have a job for as long as I want one. I will never be unemployed. Just teaching people to save money and get a bunch of money and get out of debt. Me and Jenny Craig, we got a lock for life, baby. We got enough work forever."  Our take: Apart from being completely condescending, Ramsey is basically admitting here that his entire financial empire is based on the fact that people STAY in debt and need help figuring out how to make their money last longer. Why else would they need his advice?  Here's where some financial reform would come in handy –– much handier than letting Ramsey pick your mutual funds for you, we would guess. If enough consumers truly understood financial products like 401(k)s, Roth IRAs, and investment funds, chances are they could debunk Ramsey's advice all on their own. Unfortunately, deciphering the literature is not only difficult, time consuming labor, but it's difficult for most people to even know where to start. In an interview with CBS MoneyWatch, personal finance writer Helaine Olen, hit the nail on the head:  "We're nuts when it comes to money and all we want is someone to tell us what to do. Most of us don't want to engage with our money even though we need it, and so the idea is, hey, I'll just follow this person and they'll tell me what to do. We also, in this country, have a huge attraction to this sort of tough thinking about money –– where anybody can make it and it's your fault if you don't."  If you need proof this is the kind of product Ramsey is selling, take this quote from his radio show today: "I'm just reading facts to you. I've been getting 12% on my money on average for many years. ... If you don't want to save or invest because you think the future is caving in ... then don't do it. But I'm gonna go get rich and you guys can all go gripe about it." And lastly, this:  Ramsey: "If you can wander onto the internet and go buy an S&amp;P 500 index fund, which you should be able to do if you can buy your potato chips over the internet, then you can. It has an average of slightly under 12% but that's an idiot-proof fund." Our take: This is about the only thing Ramsey gets right. Low-cost index funds have been proven to be the financially sound choice for most investors, given the fact that they don't come with all the high fees that typically eat up returns for mutual fund investors. But then we wonder why Ramsey is trying to sell people on his endorsed mutual funds if he basically admits here that low-cost, index funds are the way to go?  We asked Mark Herber, President of Index Funds Advisors, Inc. for his take:  "We have never seen any client that earned these returns over the 40 years, but our simulated index portfolios, adding $100/month, starting with high risk and reducing the equity exposure by 1% per year actually came close to his calculation.  But without passive funds, he would not even had data to make such a claim."  We reached out to Ramsey's rep for comment but haven't heard back since this afternoon.
APPresident Barack Obama just wrapped up his address to the joint session of Congress â€” the annual State of the Union address. Check our liveblog for a full recap of the speech. Here's a look at mentions of "Dorner," the ex-cop fugitive in California, vs. "State of the Union" in the last 24 hours, via Bloomberg's Jared Keller:  Better pic:  &nbsp; It is our unfinished task to restore the basic bargain that built this country &ndash; the idea that if you work hard and meet your responsibilities, you can get ahead, no matter where you come from, what you look like, or who you love." &nbsp; Now is our best chance for bipartisan, comprehensive tax reform that encourages job creation and helps bring down the deficit.&nbsp; The American people deserve a tax code that helps small businesses spend less time filling out complicated forms, and more time expanding and hiring; a tax code that ensures billionaires with high-powered accountants can&rsquo;t pay a lower rate than their hard-working secretaries; a tax code that lowers incentives to move jobs overseas, and lowers tax rates for businesses and manufacturers that create jobs right here in America.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what tax reform can deliver.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what we can do together. &nbsp; I realize that tax reform and entitlement reform won&rsquo;t be easy.&nbsp; The politics will be hard for both sides.&nbsp; None of us will get 100 percent of what we want.&nbsp; But the alternative will cost us jobs, hurt our economy, and visit hardship on millions of hardworking Americans." The good news is, we can make meaningful progress on this issue while driving strong economic growth.&nbsp; I urge this Congress to pursue a bipartisan, market-based solution to climate change, like the one John McCain and Joe Lieberman worked on together a few years ago.&nbsp; But if Congress won&rsquo;t act soon to protect future generations, I will.&nbsp; I will direct my Cabinet to come up with executive actions we can take, now and in the future, to reduce pollution, prepare our communities for the consequences of climate change, and speed the transition to more sustainable sources of energy." &nbsp; Tonight, I propose a &ldquo;Fix-It-First&rdquo; program to put people to work as soon as possible on our most urgent repairs, like the nearly 70,000 structurally deficient bridges across the country.&nbsp; And to make sure taxpayers don&rsquo;t shoulder the whole burden, I&rsquo;m also proposing a Partnership to Rebuild America that attracts private capital to upgrade what our businesses need most: modern ports to move our goods; modern pipelines to withstand a storm; modern schools worthy of our children.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s prove that there is no better place to do business than the United States of America.&nbsp; And let&rsquo;s start right away." &nbsp; But even with mortgage rates near a 50-year low, too many families with solid credit who want to buy a home are being rejected.&nbsp; Too many families who have never missed a payment and want to refinance are being told no.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s holding our entire economy back, and we need to fix it.&nbsp; Right now, there&rsquo;s a bill in this Congress that would give every responsible homeowner in America the chance to save $3,000 a year by refinancing at today&rsquo;s rates.&nbsp; Democrats and Republicans have supported it before.&nbsp; What are we waiting for?&nbsp; Take a vote, and send me that bill.&nbsp; Right now, overlapping regulations keep responsible young families from buying their first home.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s holding us back?&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s streamline the process, and help our economy grow." &nbsp; We need to give every American student opportunities like this.&nbsp; Four years ago, we started Race to the Top &ndash; a competition that convinced almost every state to develop smarter curricula and higher standards, for about 1 percent of what we spend on education each year.&nbsp; Tonight, I&rsquo;m announcing a new challenge to redesign America&rsquo;s high schools so they better equip graduates for the demands of a high-tech economy.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll reward schools that develop new partnerships with colleges and employers, and create classes that focus on science, technology, engineering, and math &ndash; the skills today&rsquo;s employers are looking for to fill jobs right now and in the future." &nbsp; Real reform means establishing a responsible pathway to earned citizenship &ndash; a path that includes passing a background check, paying taxes and a meaningful penalty, learning English, and going to the back of the line behind the folks trying to come here legally.&nbsp; &nbsp; And real reform means fixing the legal immigration system to cut waiting periods, reduce bureaucracy, and attract the highly-skilled entrepreneurs and engineers that will help create jobs and grow our economy." &nbsp; Beyond 2014, America&rsquo;s commitment to a unified and sovereign Afghanistan will endure, but the nature of our commitment will change.&nbsp; We are negotiating an agreement with the Afghan government that focuses on two missions: training and equipping Afghan forces so that the country does not again slip into chaos, and counter-terrorism efforts that allow us to pursue the remnants of al Qaeda and their affiliates. &nbsp; Today, the organization that attacked us on 9/11 is a shadow of its former self.&nbsp; Different al Qaeda affiliates and extremist groups have emerged &ndash; from the Arabian Peninsula to Africa.&nbsp; The threat these groups pose is evolving.&nbsp; But to meet this threat, we don&rsquo;t need to send tens of thousands of our sons and daughters abroad, or occupy other nations.&nbsp; Instead, we will need to help countries like Yemen, Libya, and Somalia provide for their own security, and help allies who take the fight to terrorists, as we have in Mali.&nbsp; And, where necessary, through a range of capabilities, we will continue to take direct action against those terrorists who pose the gravest threat to Americans.  &nbsp; One of those we lost was a young girl named Hadiya Pendleton.&nbsp; She was 15 years old.&nbsp; She loved Fig Newtons and lip gloss.&nbsp; She was a majorette.&nbsp; She was so good to her friends, they all thought they were her best friend.&nbsp; Just three weeks ago, she was here, in Washington, with her classmates, performing for her country at my inauguration.&nbsp; And a week later, she was shot and killed in a Chicago park after school, just a mile away from my house. &nbsp; Hadiya&rsquo;s parents, Nate and Cleo, are in this chamber tonight, along with more than two dozen Americans whose lives have been torn apart by gun violence.&nbsp; They deserve a vote. &nbsp; Gabby Giffords deserves a vote. &nbsp; The families of Newtown deserve a vote. &nbsp; The families of Aurora deserve a vote. &nbsp; The families of Oak Creek, and Tucson, and Blacksburg, and the countless other communities ripped open by gun violence &ndash; they deserve a simple vote."
The White House has released the full economic blueprint that President Barack Obama will lay out in his State Of The Union speech Tuesday night.Â  The blueprint includes 17 proposals for public investment in manufacturing, education, clean energy, and infrastructure, which Obama argues will result in economic growth and strengthen the middle class.Â  Those proposals include:Â  Read the full plan below:Â  
C-SPANWell that's unfortunate. Obama spent a lot of time talking about the deficit tonight, meaning he's spending a lot of time implicitly accepting the premise that deficit reduction needs to be a big priority. Even though he's calling for his "balanced approach" (closing loopholes!) this still sounds like deficits, deficits, deficits. We count the word deficit 10 times. He only said the word jobs 31 times. That's way out of whack. Even on the investment part, he keeps looping back to how everything is paid for and it won't cost a dime. Read the full speech here --- &gt;
Flickr / lizziecowThis will probably be the most controversial proposal of the State Of The Union: Obama calls for a $9 minimum wage. We know our economy is stronger when we reward an honest dayâ€™s work with honest wages.Â  But today, a full-time worker making the minimum wage earns $14,500 a year.Â  Even with the tax relief weâ€™ve put in place, a family with two kids that earns the minimum wage still lives below the poverty line.Â  Thatâ€™s wrong.Â  Thatâ€™s why, since the last time this Congress raised the minimum wage, nineteen states have chosen to bump theirs even higher. Tonight, letâ€™s declare that in the wealthiest nation on Earth, no one who works full-time should have to live in poverty, and raise the federal minimum wage to $9.00 an hour.Â  This single step would raise the incomes of millions of working families.Â  It could mean the difference between groceries or the food bank; rent or eviction; scraping by or finally getting ahead.Â  For businesses across the country, it would mean customers with more money in their pockets.Â  In fact, working folks shouldnâ€™t have to wait year after year for the minimum wage to go up while CEO pay has never been higher.Â  So hereâ€™s an idea that Governor Romney and I actually agreed on last year: letâ€™s tie the minimum wage to the cost of living, so that it finally becomes a wage you can live on. This seems very unlikely to happen.
From his speech tonight, a call to save more on Medicare... On Medicare, Iâ€™m prepared to enact reforms that will achieve the same amount of health care savings by the beginning of the next decade as the reforms proposed by the bipartisan Simpson-Bowles commission.Â  Already, the Affordable Care Act is helping to slow the growth of health care costs.Â  The reforms Iâ€™m proposing go even further.Â  Weâ€™ll reduce taxpayer subsidies to prescription drug companies and ask more from the wealthiest seniors.Â  Weâ€™ll bring down costs by changing the way our government pays for Medicare, because our medical bills shouldnâ€™t be based on the number of tests ordered or days spent in the hospital â€“ they should be based on the quality of care that our seniors receive.Â  And I am open to additional reforms from both parties, so long as they donâ€™t violate the guarantee of a secure retirement.Â  Our government shouldnâ€™t make promises we cannot keep â€“ but we must keep the promises weâ€™ve already made.Â 
In his speech tonight, President Obama presents an alternative to the upcoming sequester, the automatic spending cuts that go into effect on March 1. ---------------------------------------------------------- Now we need to finish the job.  And the question is, how?   In 2011, Congress passed a law saying that if both parties couldn’t agree on a plan to reach our deficit goal, about a trillion dollars’ worth of budget cuts would automatically go into effect this year.  These sudden, harsh, arbitrary cuts would jeopardize our military readiness.  They’d devastate priorities like education, energy, and medical research. They would certainly slow our recovery, and cost us hundreds of thousands of jobs.  That’s why Democrats, Republicans, business leaders, and economists have already said that these cuts, known here in Washington as “the sequester,” are a really bad idea.  Now, some in this Congress have proposed preventing only the defense cuts by making even bigger cuts to things like education and job training; Medicare and Social Security benefits.  That idea is even worse.  Yes, the biggest driver of our long-term debt is the rising cost of health care for an aging population.  And those of us who care deeply about programs like Medicare must embrace the need for modest reforms – otherwise, our retirement programs will crowd out the investments we need for our children, and jeopardize the promise of a secure retirement for future generations.  But we can’t ask senior citizens and working families to shoulder the entire burden of deficit reduction while asking nothing more from the wealthiest and most powerful.  We won’t grow the middle class simply by shifting the cost of health care or college onto families that are already struggling, or by forcing communities to lay off more teachers, cops, and firefighters.  Most Americans – Democrats, Republicans, and Independents – understand that we can’t just cut our way to prosperity.  They know that broad-based economic growth requires a balanced approach to deficit reduction, with spending cuts and revenue, and with everybody doing their fair share.   And that’s the approach I offer tonight.  On Medicare, I’m prepared to enact reforms that will achieve the same amount of health care savings by the beginning of the next decade as the reforms proposed by the bipartisan Simpson-Bowles commission.  Already, the Affordable Care Act is helping to slow the growth of health care costs.  The reforms I’m proposing go even further.  We’ll reduce taxpayer subsidies to prescription drug companies and ask more from the wealthiest seniors.  We’ll bring down costs by changing the way our government pays for Medicare, because our medical bills shouldn’t be based on the number of tests ordered or days spent in the hospital – they should be based on the quality of care that our seniors receive.  And I am open to additional reforms from both parties, so long as they don’t violate the guarantee of a secure retirement.  Our government shouldn’t make promises we cannot keep – but we must keep the promises we’ve already made.  To hit the rest of our deficit reduction target, we should do what leaders in both parties have already suggested, and save hundreds of billions of dollars by getting rid of tax loopholes and deductions for the well-off and well-connected.  After all, why would we choose to make deeper cuts to education and Medicare just to protect special interest tax breaks?  How is that fair?  How does that promote growth? Now is our best chance for bipartisan, comprehensive tax reform that encourages job creation and helps bring down the deficit.  The American people deserve a tax code that helps small businesses spend less time filling out complicated forms, and more time expanding and hiring; a tax code that ensures billionaires with high-powered accountants can’t pay a lower rate than their hard-working secretaries; a tax code that lowers incentives to move jobs overseas, and lowers tax rates for businesses and manufacturers that create jobs right here in America.  That’s what tax reform can deliver.  That’s what we can do together. I realize that tax reform and entitlement reform won’t be easy.  The politics will be hard for both sides.  None of us will get 100 percent of what we want.  But the alternative will cost us jobs, hurt our economy, and visit hardship on millions of hardworking Americans.  So let’s set party interests aside, and work to pass a budget that replaces reckless cuts with smart savings and wise investments in our future.  And let’s do it without the brinksmanship that stresses consumers and scares off investors.  The greatest nation on Earth cannot keep conducting its business by drifting from one manufactured crisis to the next.  Let’s agree, right here, right now, to keep the people’s government open, pay our bills on time, and always uphold the full faith and credit of the United States of America.  The American people have worked too hard, for too long, rebuilding from one crisis to see their elected officials cause another.
Below is the full text of the State of the Union speech that President Barack Obama will deliver to Congress Tuesday night:  Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, fellow citizens:   Fifty-one years ago, John F. Kennedy declared to this Chamber that “the Constitution makes us not rivals for power but partners for progress…It is my task,” he said, “to report the State of the Union – to improve it is the task of us all.”   Tonight, thanks to the grit and determination of the American people, there is much progress to report.  After a decade of grinding war, our brave men and women in uniform are coming home.  After years of grueling recession, our businesses have created over six million new jobs.  We buy more American cars than we have in five years, and less foreign oil than we have in twenty.  Our housing market is healing, our stock market is rebounding, and consumers, patients, and homeowners enjoy stronger protections than ever before.  Together, we have cleared away the rubble of crisis, and can say with renewed confidence that the state of our union is stronger.  But we gather here knowing that there are millions of Americans whose hard work and dedication have not yet been rewarded.  Our economy is adding jobs – but too many people still can’t find full-time employment.  Corporate profits have rocketed to all-time highs – but for more than a decade, wages and incomes have barely budged.   It is our generation’s task, then, to reignite the true engine of America’s economic growth – a rising, thriving middle class.  It is our unfinished task to restore the basic bargain that built this country – the idea that if you work hard and meet your responsibilities, you can get ahead, no matter where you come from, what you look like, or who you love.  It is our unfinished task to make sure that this government works on behalf of the many, and not just the few; that it encourages free enterprise, rewards individual initiative, and opens the doors of opportunity to every child across this great nation. The American people don’t expect government to solve every problem.  They don’t expect those of us in this chamber to agree on every issue.  But they do expect us to put the nation’s interests before party.  They do expect us to forge reasonable compromise where we can.  For they know that America moves forward only when we do so together; and that the responsibility of improving this union remains the task of us all. Our work must begin by making some basic decisions about our budget – decisions that will have a huge impact on the strength of our recovery. Over the last few years, both parties have worked together to reduce the deficit by more than $2.5 trillion – mostly through spending cuts, but also by raising tax rates on the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans.  As a result, we are more than halfway towards the goal of $4 trillion in deficit reduction that economists say we need to stabilize our finances.     Now we need to finish the job.  And the question is, how? In 2011, Congress passed a law saying that if both parties couldn’t agree on a plan to reach our deficit goal, about a trillion dollars’ worth of budget cuts would automatically go into effect this year.  These sudden, harsh, arbitrary cuts would jeopardize our military readiness.  They’d devastate priorities like education, energy, and medical research. They would certainly slow our recovery, and cost us hundreds of thousands of jobs.  That’s why Democrats, Republicans, business leaders, and economists have already said that these cuts, known here in Washington as “the sequester,” are a really bad idea.  Now, some in this Congress have proposed preventing only the defense cuts by making even bigger cuts to things like education and job training; Medicare and Social Security benefits.  That idea is even worse.  Yes, the biggest driver of our long-term debt is the rising cost of health care for an aging population.  And those of us who care deeply about programs like Medicare must embrace the need for modest reforms – otherwise, our retirement programs will crowd out the investments we need for our children, and jeopardize the promise of a secure retirement for future generations.  But we can’t ask senior citizens and working families to shoulder the entire burden of deficit reduction while asking nothing more from the wealthiest and most powerful.  We won’t grow the middle class simply by shifting the cost of health care or college onto families that are already struggling, or by forcing communities to lay off more teachers, cops, and firefighters.  Most Americans – Democrats, Republicans, and Independents – understand that we can’t just cut our way to prosperity.  They know that broad-based economic growth requires a balanced approach to deficit reduction, with spending cuts and revenue, and with everybody doing their fair share.   And that’s the approach I offer tonight.  On Medicare, I’m prepared to enact reforms that will achieve the same amount of health care savings by the beginning of the next decade as the reforms proposed by the bipartisan Simpson-Bowles commission.  Already, the Affordable Care Act is helping to slow the growth of health care costs.  The reforms I’m proposing go even further.  We’ll reduce taxpayer subsidies to prescription drug companies and ask more from the wealthiest seniors.  We’ll bring down costs by changing the way our government pays for Medicare, because our medical bills shouldn’t be based on the number of tests ordered or days spent in the hospital – they should be based on the quality of care that our seniors receive.  And I am open to additional reforms from both parties, so long as they don’t violate the guarantee of a secure retirement.  Our government shouldn’t make promises we cannot keep – but we must keep the promises we’ve already made.  To hit the rest of our deficit reduction target, we should do what leaders in both parties have already suggested, and save hundreds of billions of dollars by getting rid of tax loopholes and deductions for the well-off and well-connected.  After all, why would we choose to make deeper cuts to education and Medicare just to protect special interest tax breaks?  How is that fair?  How does that promote growth? Now is our best chance for bipartisan, comprehensive tax reform that encourages job creation and helps bring down the deficit.  The American people deserve a tax code that helps small businesses spend less time filling out complicated forms, and more time expanding and hiring; a tax code that ensures billionaires with high-powered accountants can’t pay a lower rate than their hard-working secretaries; a tax code that lowers incentives to move jobs overseas, and lowers tax rates for businesses and manufacturers that create jobs right here in America.  That’s what tax reform can deliver.  That’s what we can do together. I realize that tax reform and entitlement reform won’t be easy.  The politics will be hard for both sides.  None of us will get 100 percent of what we want.  But the alternative will cost us jobs, hurt our economy, and visit hardship on millions of hardworking Americans.  So let’s set party interests aside, and work to pass a budget that replaces reckless cuts with smart savings and wise investments in our future.  And let’s do it without the brinksmanship that stresses consumers and scares off investors.  The greatest nation on Earth cannot keep conducting its business by drifting from one manufactured crisis to the next.  Let’s agree, right here, right now, to keep the people’s government open, pay our bills on time, and always uphold the full faith and credit of the United States of America.  The American people have worked too hard, for too long, rebuilding from one crisis to see their elected officials cause another. Now, most of us agree that a plan to reduce the deficit must be part of our agenda.  But let’s be clear: deficit reduction alone is not an economic plan.  A growing economy that creates good, middle-class jobs – that must be the North Star that guides our efforts.  Every day, we should ask ourselves three questions as a nation:  How do we attract more jobs to our shores?  How do we equip our people with the skills needed to do those jobs?  And how do we make sure that hard work leads to a decent living? A year and a half ago, I put forward an American Jobs Act that independent economists said would create more than one million new jobs.  I thank the last Congress for passing some of that agenda, and I urge this Congress to pass the rest.  Tonight, I’ll lay out additional proposals that are fully paid for and fully consistent with the budget framework both parties agreed to just 18 months ago.  Let me repeat – nothing I’m proposing tonight should increase our deficit by a single dime.  It’s not a bigger government we need, but a smarter government that sets priorities and invests in broad-based growth. Our first priority is making America a magnet for new jobs and manufacturing.  After shedding jobs for more than 10 years, our manufacturers have added about 500,000 jobs over the past three. Caterpillar is bringing jobs back from Japan.  Ford is bringing jobs back from Mexico. After locating plants in other countries like China, Intel is opening its most advanced plant right here at home.  And this year, Apple will start making Macs in America again. There are things we can do, right now, to accelerate this trend.  Last year, we created our first manufacturing innovation institute in Youngstown, Ohio.  A once-shuttered warehouse is now a state-of-the art lab where new workers are mastering the 3D printing that has the potential to revolutionize the way we make almost everything.  There’s no reason this can’t happen in other towns.  So tonight, I’m announcing the launch of three more of these manufacturing hubs, where businesses will partner with the Departments of Defense and Energy to turn regions left behind by globalization into global centers of high-tech jobs.  And I ask this Congress to help create a network of fifteen of these hubs and guarantee that the next revolution in manufacturing is Made in America. If we want to make the best products, we also have to invest in the best ideas.  Every dollar we invested to map the human genome returned $140 to our economy.  Today, our scientists are mapping the human brain to unlock the answers to Alzheimer’s; developing drugs to regenerate damaged organs; devising new material to make batteries ten times more powerful.  Now is not the time to gut these job-creating investments in science and innovation.  Now is the time to reach a level of research and development not seen since the height of the Space Race.  And today, no area holds more promise than our investments in American energy.  After years of talking about it, we are finally poised to control our own energy future.  We produce more oil at home than we have in 15 years.  We have doubled the distance our cars will go on a gallon of gas, and the amount of renewable energy we generate from sources like wind and solar – with tens of thousands of good, American jobs to show for it.  We produce more natural gas than ever before – and nearly everyone’s energy bill is lower because of it.  And over the last four years, our emissions of the dangerous carbon pollution that threatens our planet have actually fallen. But for the sake of our children and our future, we must do more to combat climate change.  Yes, it’s true that no single event makes a trend.  But the fact is, the 12 hottest years on record have all come in the last 15.  Heat waves, droughts, wildfires, and floods – all are now more frequent and intense.  We can choose to believe that Superstorm Sandy, and the most severe drought in decades, and the worst wildfires some states have ever seen were all just a freak coincidence.  Or we can choose to believe in the overwhelming judgment of science – and act before it’s too late.    The good news is, we can make meaningful progress on this issue while driving strong economic growth.  I urge this Congress to pursue a bipartisan, market-based solution to climate change, like the one John McCain and Joe Lieberman worked on together a few years ago.  But if Congress won’t act soon to protect future generations, I will.  I will direct my Cabinet to come up with executive actions we can take, now and in the future, to reduce pollution, prepare our communities for the consequences of climate change, and speed the transition to more sustainable sources of energy. Four years ago, other countries dominated the clean energy market and the jobs that came with it.  We’ve begun to change that.  Last year, wind energy added nearly half of all new power capacity in America.  So let’s generate even more.  Solar energy gets cheaper by the year – so let’s drive costs down even further.  As long as countries like China keep going all-in on clean energy, so must we. In the meantime, the natural gas boom has led to cleaner power and greater energy independence.  That’s why my Administration will keep cutting red tape and speeding up new oil and gas permits.  But I also want to work with this Congress to encourage the research and technology that helps natural gas burn even cleaner and protects our air and water.  Indeed, much of our new-found energy is drawn from lands and waters that we, the public, own together.  So tonight, I propose we use some of our oil and gas revenues to fund an Energy Security Trust that will drive new research and technology to shift our cars and trucks off oil for good.  If a non-partisan coalition of CEOs and retired generals and admirals can get behind this idea, then so can we.  Let’s take their advice and free our families and businesses from the painful spikes in gas prices we’ve put up with for far too long.  I’m also issuing a new goal for America: let’s cut in half the energy wasted by our homes and businesses over the next twenty years.  The states with the best ideas to create jobs and lower energy bills by constructing more efficient buildings will receive federal support to help make it happen. America’s energy sector is just one part of an aging infrastructure badly in need of repair.  Ask any CEO where they’d rather locate and hire: a country with deteriorating roads and bridges, or one with high-speed rail and internet; high-tech schools and self-healing power grids.  The CEO of Siemens America – a company that brought hundreds of new jobs to North Carolina – has said that if we upgrade our infrastructure, they’ll bring even more jobs.  And I know that you want these job-creating projects in your districts.  I’ve seen you all at the ribbon-cuttings. Tonight, I propose a “Fix-It-First” program to put people to work as soon as possible on our most urgent repairs, like the nearly 70,000 structurally deficient bridges across the country.  And to make sure taxpayers don’t shoulder the whole burden, I’m also proposing a Partnership to Rebuild America that attracts private capital to upgrade what our businesses need most: modern ports to move our goods; modern pipelines to withstand a storm; modern schools worthy of our children.  Let’s prove that there is no better place to do business than the United States of America.  And let’s start right away.  Part of our rebuilding effort must also involve our housing sector.  Today, our housing market is finally healing from the collapse of 2007.  Home prices are rising at the fastest pace in six years, home purchases are up nearly 50 percent, and construction is expanding again.  But even with mortgage rates near a 50-year low, too many families with solid credit who want to buy a home are being rejected.  Too many families who have never missed a payment and want to refinance are being told no.  That’s holding our entire economy back, and we need to fix it.  Right now, there’s a bill in this Congress that would give every responsible homeowner in America the chance to save $3,000 a year by refinancing at today’s rates.  Democrats and Republicans have supported it before.  What are we waiting for?  Take a vote, and send me that bill.  Right now, overlapping regulations keep responsible young families from buying their first home.  What’s holding us back?  Let’s streamline the process, and help our economy grow. These initiatives in manufacturing, energy, infrastructure, and housing will help entrepreneurs and small business owners expand and create new jobs.  But none of it will matter unless we also equip our citizens with the skills and training to fill those jobs.  And that has to start at the earliest possible age.  Study after study shows that the sooner a child begins learning, the better he or she does down the road.  But today, fewer than 3 in 10 four year-olds are enrolled in a high-quality preschool program.  Most middle-class parents can’t afford a few hundred bucks a week for private preschool.  And for poor kids who need help the most, this lack of access to preschool education can shadow them for the rest of their lives.  Tonight, I propose working with states to make high-quality preschool available to every child in America.  Every dollar we invest in high-quality early education can save more than seven dollars later on – by boosting graduation rates, reducing teen pregnancy, even reducing violent crime.  In states that make it a priority to educate our youngest children, like Georgia or Oklahoma, studies show students grow up more likely to read and do math at grade level, graduate high school, hold a job, and form more stable families of their own.  So let’s do what works, and make sure none of our children start the race of life already behind.  Let’s give our kids that chance. Let’s also make sure that a high school diploma puts our kids on a path to a good job.  Right now, countries like Germany focus on graduating their high school students with the equivalent of a technical degree from one of our community colleges, so that they’re ready for a job.  At schools like P-Tech in Brooklyn, a collaboration between New York Public Schools, the City University of New York, and IBM, students will graduate with a high school diploma and an associate degree in computers or engineering.  We need to give every American student opportunities like this.  Four years ago, we started Race to the Top – a competition that convinced almost every state to develop smarter curricula and higher standards, for about 1 percent of what we spend on education each year.  Tonight, I’m announcing a new challenge to redesign America’s high schools so they better equip graduates for the demands of a high-tech economy.  We’ll reward schools that develop new partnerships with colleges and employers, and create classes that focus on science, technology, engineering, and math – the skills today’s employers are looking for to fill jobs right now and in the future. Now, even with better high schools, most young people will need some higher education.  It’s a simple fact: the more education you have, the more likely you are to have a job and work your way into the middle class.  But today, skyrocketing costs price way too many young people out of a higher education, or saddle them with unsustainable debt.  Through tax credits, grants, and better loans, we have made college more affordable for millions of students and families over the last few years.  But taxpayers cannot continue to subsidize the soaring cost of higher education.  Colleges must do their part to keep costs down, and it’s our job to make sure they do.  Tonight, I ask Congress to change the Higher Education Act, so that affordability and value are included in determining which colleges receive certain types of federal aid.  And tomorrow, my Administration will release a new “College Scorecard” that parents and students can use to compare schools based on a simple criteria: where you can get the most bang for your educational buck.   To grow our middle class, our citizens must have access to the education and training that today’s jobs require.  But we also have to make sure that America remains a place where everyone who’s willing to work hard has the chance to get ahead. Our economy is stronger when we harness the talents and ingenuity of striving, hopeful immigrants.  And right now, leaders from the business, labor, law enforcement, and faith communities all agree that the time has come to pass comprehensive immigration reform.    Real reform means strong border security, and we can build on the progress my Administration has already made – putting more boots on the southern border than at any time in our history, and reducing illegal crossings to their lowest levels in 40 years.  Real reform means establishing a responsible pathway to earned citizenship – a path that includes passing a background check, paying taxes and a meaningful penalty, learning English, and going to the back of the line behind the folks trying to come here legally.  And real reform means fixing the legal immigration system to cut waiting periods, reduce bureaucracy, and attract the highly-skilled entrepreneurs and engineers that will help create jobs and grow our economy. In other words, we know what needs to be done.  As we speak, bipartisan groups in both chambers are working diligently to draft a bill, and I applaud their efforts.  Now let’s get this done.  Send me a comprehensive immigration reform bill in the next few months, and I will sign it right away. But we can’t stop there.  We know our economy is stronger when our wives, mothers, and daughters can live their lives free from discrimination in the workplace, and free from the fear of domestic violence.  Today, the Senate passed the Violence Against Women Act that Joe Biden originally wrote almost 20 years ago.  I urge the House to do the same.  And I ask this Congress to declare that women should earn a living equal to their efforts, and finally pass the Paycheck Fairness Act this year We know our economy is stronger when we reward an honest day’s work with honest wages.  But today, a full-time worker making the minimum wage earns $14,500 a year.  Even with the tax relief we’ve put in place, a family with two kids that earns the minimum wage still lives below the poverty line.  That’s wrong.  That’s why, since the last time this Congress raised the minimum wage, nineteen states have chosen to bump theirs even higher. Tonight, let’s declare that in the wealthiest nation on Earth, no one who works full-time should have to live in poverty, and raise the federal minimum wage to $9.00 an hour.  This single step would raise the incomes of millions of working families.  It could mean the difference between groceries or the food bank; rent or eviction; scraping by or finally getting ahead.  For businesses across the country, it would mean customers with more money in their pockets.  In fact, working folks shouldn’t have to wait year after year for the minimum wage to go up while CEO pay has never been higher.  So here’s an idea that Governor Romney and I actually agreed on last year: let’s tie the minimum wage to the cost of living, so that it finally becomes a wage you can live on. Tonight, let’s also recognize that there are communities in this country where no matter how hard you work, it’s virtually impossible to get ahead.  Factory towns decimated from years of plants packing up.  Inescapable pockets of poverty, urban and rural, where young adults are still fighting for their first job.  America is not a place where chance of birth or circumstance should decide our destiny.  And that is why we need to build new ladders of opportunity into the middle class for all who are willing to climb them. Let’s offer incentives to companies that hire Americans who’ve got what it takes to fill that job opening, but have been out of work so long that no one will give them a chance.  Let’s put people back to work rebuilding vacant homes in run-down neighborhoods.  And this year, my Administration will begin to partner with 20 of the hardest-hit towns in America to get these communities back on their feet.  We’ll work with local leaders to target resources at public safety, education, and housing.  We’ll give new tax credits to businesses that hire and invest.  And we’ll work to strengthen families by removing the financial deterrents to marriage for low-income couples, and doing more to encourage fatherhood – because what makes you a man isn’t the ability to conceive a child; it’s having the courage to raise one. Stronger families.  Stronger communities.  A stronger America.  It is this kind of prosperity – broad, shared, and built on a thriving middle class – that has always been the source of our progress at home.  It is also the foundation of our power and influence throughout the world. Tonight, we stand united in saluting the troops and civilians who sacrifice every day to protect us. Because of them, we can say with confidence that America will complete its mission in Afghanistan, and achieve our objective of defeating the core of al Qaeda.  Already, we have brought home 33,000 of our brave servicemen and women.  This spring, our forces will move into a support role, while Afghan security forces take the lead.  Tonight, I can announce that over the next year, another 34,000 American troops will come home from Afghanistan.  This drawdown will continue.  And by the end of next year, our war in Afghanistan will be over.  Beyond 2014, America’s commitment to a unified and sovereign Afghanistan will endure, but the nature of our commitment will change.  We are negotiating an agreement with the Afghan government that focuses on two missions: training and equipping Afghan forces so that the country does not again slip into chaos, and counter-terrorism efforts that allow us to pursue the remnants of al Qaeda and their affiliates  Today, the organization that attacked us on 9/11 is a shadow of its former self.  Different al Qaeda affiliates and extremist groups have emerged – from the Arabian Peninsula to Africa.  The threat these groups pose is evolving.  But to meet this threat, we don’t need to send tens of thousands of our sons and daughters abroad, or occupy other nations.  Instead, we will need to help countries like Yemen, Libya, and Somalia provide for their own security, and help allies who take the fight to terrorists, as we have in Mali.  And, where necessary, through a range of capabilities, we will continue to take direct action against those terrorists who pose the gravest threat to Americans. As we do, we must enlist our values in the fight.  That is why my Administration has worked tirelessly to forge a durable legal and policy framework to guide our counterterrorism operations.  Throughout, we have kept Congress fully informed of our efforts.  I recognize that in our democracy, no one should just take my word that we’re doing things the right way.  So, in the months ahead, I will continue to engage with Congress to ensure not only that our targeting, detention, and prosecution of terrorists remains consistent with our laws and system of checks and balances, but that our efforts are even more transparent to the American people and to the world. Of course, our challenges don’t end with al Qaeda.  America will continue to lead the effort to prevent the spread of the world’s most dangerous weapons.  The regime in North Korea must know that they will only achieve security and prosperity by meeting their international obligations.  Provocations of the sort we saw last night will only isolate them further, as we stand by our allies, strengthen our own missile defense, and lead the world in taking firm action in response to these threats.  Likewise, the leaders of Iran must recognize that now is the time for a diplomatic solution, because a coalition stands united in demanding that they meet their obligations, and we will do what is necessary to prevent them from getting a nuclear weapon.  At the same time, we will engage Russia to seek further reductions in our nuclear arsenals, and continue leading the global effort to secure nuclear materials that could fall into the wrong hands – because our ability to influence others depends on our willingness to lead. America must also face the rapidly growing threat from cyber-attacks.  We know hackers steal people’s identities and infiltrate private e-mail.  We know foreign countries and companies swipe our corporate secrets.  Now our enemies are also seeking the ability to sabotage our power grid, our financial institutions, and our air traffic control systems.  We cannot look back years from now and wonder why we did nothing in the face of real threats to our security and our economy.  That’s why, earlier today, I signed a new executive order that will strengthen our cyber defenses by increasing information sharing, and developing standards to protect our national security, our jobs, and our privacy.  Now, Congress must act as well, by passing legislation to give our government a greater capacity to secure our networks and deter attacks.  Even as we protect our people, we should remember that today’s world presents not only dangers, but opportunities.  To boost American exports, support American jobs, and level the playing field in the growing markets of Asia, we intend to complete negotiations on a Trans-Pacific Partnership.  And tonight, I am announcing that we will launch talks on a comprehensive Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the European Union – because trade that is free and fair across the Atlantic supports millions of good-paying American jobs. We also know that progress in the most impoverished parts of our world enriches us all.  In many places, people live on little more than a dollar a day.  So the United States will join with our allies to eradicate such extreme poverty in the next two decades: by connecting more people to the global economy and empowering women; by giving our young and brightest minds new opportunities to serve and helping communities to feed, power, and educate themselves; by saving the world’s children from preventable deaths; and by realizing the promise of an AIDS-free generation.   Above all, America must remain a beacon to all who seek freedom during this period of historic change.  I saw the power of hope last year in Rangoon – when Aung San Suu Kyi welcomed an American President into the home where she had been imprisoned for years; when thousands of Burmese lined the streets, waving American flags, including a man who said, “There is justice and law in the United States.  I want our country to be like that.” In defense of freedom, we will remain the anchor of strong alliances from the Americas to Africa; from Europe to Asia.  In the Middle East, we will stand with citizens as they demand their universal rights, and support stable transitions to democracy.  The process will be messy, and we cannot presume to dictate the course of change in countries like Egypt; but we can – and will – insist on respect for the fundamental rights of all people.  We will keep the pressure on a Syrian regime that has murdered its own people, and support opposition leaders that respect the rights of every Syrian.  And we will stand steadfast with Israel in pursuit of security and a lasting peace.  These are the messages I will deliver when I travel to the Middle East next month. All this work depends on the courage and sacrifice of those who serve in dangerous places at great personal risk – our diplomats, our intelligence officers, and the men and women of the United States Armed Forces.  As long as I’m Commander-in-Chief, we will do whatever we must to protect those who serve their country abroad, and we will maintain the best military in the world.  We will invest in new capabilities, even as we reduce waste and wartime spending.  We will ensure equal treatment for all service members, and equal benefits for their families – gay and straight.  We will draw upon the courage and skills of our sisters and daughters, because women have proven under fire that they are ready for combat.  We will keep faith with our veterans – investing in world-class care, including mental health care, for our wounded warriors; supporting our military families; and giving our veterans the benefits, education, and job opportunities they have earned.  And I want to thank my wife Michelle and Dr. Jill Biden for their continued dedication to serving our military families as well as they serve us. But defending our freedom is not the job of our military alone.  We must all do our part to make sure our God-given rights are protected here at home.  That includes our most fundamental right as citizens:  the right to vote.  When any Americans – no matter where they live or what their party – are denied that right simply because they can’t wait for five, six, seven hours just to cast their ballot, we are betraying our ideals.  That’s why, tonight, I’m announcing a non-partisan commission to improve the voting experience in America.  And I’m asking two long-time experts in the field, who’ve recently served as the top attorneys for my campaign and for Governor Romney’s campaign, to lead it.  We can fix this, and we will.  The American people demand it.  And so does our democracy. Of course, what I’ve said tonight matters little if we don’t come together to protect our most precious resource – our children.  It has been two months since Newtown.  I know this is not the first time this country has debated how to reduce gun violence.  But this time is different.  Overwhelming majorities of Americans – Americans who believe in the 2nd Amendment – have come together around commonsense reform – like background checks that will make it harder for criminals to get their hands on a gun.  Senators of both parties are working together on tough new laws to prevent anyone from buying guns for resale to criminals.  Police chiefs are asking our help to get weapons of war and massive ammunition magazines off our streets, because they are tired of being outgunned.  Each of these proposals deserves a vote in Congress.  If you want to vote no, that’s your choice.  But these proposals deserve a vote.  Because in the two months since Newtown, more than a thousand birthdays, graduations, and anniversaries have been stolen from our lives by a bullet from a gun. One of those we lost was a young girl named Hadiya Pendleton.  She was 15 years old.  She loved Fig Newtons and lip gloss.  She was a majorette.  She was so good to her friends, they all thought they were her best friend.  Just three weeks ago, she was here, in Washington, with her classmates, performing for her country at my inauguration.  And a week later, she was shot and killed in a Chicago park after school, just a mile away from my house. Hadiya’s parents, Nate and Cleo, are in this chamber tonight, along with more than two dozen Americans whose lives have been torn apart by gun violence.  They deserve a vote. Gabby Giffords deserves a vote. The families of Newtown deserve a vote. The families of Aurora deserve a vote. The families of Oak Creek, and Tucson, and Blacksburg, and the countless other communities ripped open by gun violence – they deserve a simple vote. Our actions will not prevent every senseless act of violence in this country.  Indeed, no laws, no initiatives, no administrative acts will perfectly solve all the challenges I’ve outlined tonight.  But we were never sent here to be perfect.  We were sent here to make what difference we can, to secure this nation, expand opportunity, and uphold our ideals through the hard, often frustrating, but absolutely necessary work of self-government. We were sent here to look out for our fellow Americans the same way they look out for one another, every single day, usually without fanfare, all across this country.  We should follow their example.  We should follow the example of a New York City nurse named Menchu Sanchez.  When Hurricane Sandy plunged her hospital into darkness, her thoughts were not with how her own home was faring – they were with the twenty precious newborns in her care and the rescue plan she devised that kept them all safe. We should follow the example of a North Miami woman named Desiline Victor.  When she arrived at her polling place, she was told the wait to vote might be six hours.  And as time ticked by, her concern was not with her tired body or aching feet, but whether folks like her would get to have their say.  Hour after hour, a throng of people stayed in line in support of her.  Because Desiline is 102 years old.  And they erupted in cheers when she finally put on a sticker that read “I Voted.” We should follow the example of a police officer named Brian Murphy.  When a gunman opened fire on a Sikh temple in Wisconsin, and Brian was the first to arrive, he did not consider his own safety.  He fought back until help arrived, and ordered his fellow officers to protect the safety of the Americans worshiping inside – even as he lay bleeding from twelve bullet wounds. When asked how he did that, Brian said, “That’s just the way we’re made.” That’s just the way we’re made We may do different jobs, and wear different uniforms, and hold different views than the person beside us.  But as Americans, we all share the same proud title: We are citizens.  It’s a word that doesn’t just describe our nationality or legal status.  It describes the way we’re made.  It describes what we believe.  It captures the enduring idea that this country only works when we accept certain obligations to one another and to future generations; that our rights are wrapped up in the rights of others; and that well into our third century as a nation, it remains the task of us all, as citizens of these United States, to be the authors of the next great chapter in our American story.  Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.
cristiano_betta / FlickrWednesday morning, all eyes will be on the January retail sales report, which will get published at 8:30 AM ET. Economists are expecting a 0.1 percent gain, and a 0.3 percent increase excluding autos and gas. However, no economist is completely married to those forecasts because January sales will be impacted by a number of things, most importantly the unfavorable effect of the payroll tax increase. As such, some strategists have declared the report the "moment of truth" or "the most important datapoint of the year."  But from the information we've gathered so far, it doesn't look like the tax hike had a major impact on sales.

APHouse Speaker John Boehner's office has released excerpts from Sen. Marco Rubio's GOP response to the State of the Union address tonight, in which Rubio plans to cast President Barack Obama's economic plans as "big government" proposals that will harm the economy. Rubio will attack Obama for an "obsession" with raising taxes as a means to reduce the budget deficit, saying it will not spur economic growth. Rubio will warn that this could be the "generation responsible for America's decline" unless Washington works to "get our economy healthy again." Here are the excerpts: "This opportunity – to make it to the middle class or beyond no matter where you start out in life – it isn’t bestowed on us from Washington.  It comes from a vibrant free economy where people can risk their own money to open a business. And when they succeed, they hire more people, who in turn invest or spend the money they make, helping others start a business and create jobs.  Presidents in both parties – from John F. Kennedy to Ronald Reagan – have known that our free enterprise economy is the source of our middle class prosperity.  But President Obama?  He believes it’s the cause of our problems." … "Mr. President, I still live in the same working class neighborhood I grew up in. My neighbors aren’t millionaires. They’re retirees who depend on Social Security and Medicare. They’re workers who have to get up early tomorrow morning and go to work to pay the bills. They’re immigrants, who came here because they were stuck in poverty in countries where the government dominated the economy.  The tax increases and the deficit spending you propose will hurt middle class families. It will cost them their raises. It will cost them their benefits. It may even cost some of them their jobs.  And it will hurt seniors because it does nothing to save Medicare and Social Security.  So Mr. President, I don’t oppose your plans because I want to protect the rich. I oppose your plans because I want to protect my neighbors."  … "Economic growth is the best way to help the middle class.  Unfortunately, our economy actually shrank during the last three months of 2012.  But if we can get the economy to grow at just 4 percent a year, it would create millions of middle class jobs. And it could reduce our deficits by almost $4 trillion dollars over the next decade.  Tax increases can’t do this. Raising taxes won’t create private sector jobs. And there’s no realistic tax increase that could lower our deficits by almost $4 trillion. That’s why I hope the President will abandon his obsession with raising taxes and instead work with us to achieve real growth in our economy."   … "The real cause of our debt is that our government has been spending 1 trillion dollars more than it takes in every year. That’s why we need a balanced budget amendment.  The biggest obstacles to balancing the budget are programs where spending is already locked in.  One of these programs, Medicare, is especially important to me. It provided my father the care he needed to battle cancer and ultimately die with dignity. And it pays for the care my mother receives now.  I would never support any changes to Medicare that would hurt seniors like my mother.  But anyone who is in favor of leaving Medicare exactly the way it is right now, is in favor of bankrupting it."   … "Despite our differences, I know that both Republicans and Democrats love America. I pray we can come together to solve our problems, because the choices before us could not be more important.  If we can get our economy healthy again, our children will be the most prosperous Americans ever.  And if we do not, we will forever be known as the generation responsible for America’s decline."

APThe White House has released the first excerpts of President Barack Obama's State Of The Union address. As expected, the remarks focus on the economy and middle class jobs growth, framing domestic economic policy within the context of the President's liberal agenda.  “It is our generation’s task, then, to reignite the true engine of America’s economic growth – a rising, thriving middle class," Obama will say. And later: “A growing economy that creates good, middle-class jobs – that must be the North Star that guides our efforts. Every day, we should ask ourselves three questions as a nation:  How do we attract more jobs to our shores? How do we equip our people with the skills needed to do those jobs? And how do we make sure that hard work leads to a decent living?” In the remarks, the President also promises that the proposals in his speech will not add to the federal deficit, offering a hint at the message Obama will deliver on the federal deficit.  Read the full excerpts below:  “It is our generation’s task, then, to reignite the true engine of America’s economic growth – a rising, thriving middle class. It is our unfinished task to restore the basic bargain that built this country – the idea that if you work hard and meet your responsibilities, you can get ahead, no matter where you come from, what you look like, or who you love. It is our unfinished task to make sure that this government works on behalf of the many, and not just the few; that it encourages free enterprise, rewards individual initiative, and opens the doors of opportunity to every child across this great nation of ours.” … “A growing economy that creates good, middle-class jobs – that must be the North Star that guides our efforts.  Every day, we should ask ourselves three questions as a nation:  How do we attract more jobs to our shores?  How do we equip our people with the skills needed to do those jobs?  And how do we make sure that hard work leads to a decent living?” … “Tonight, I’ll lay out additional proposals that are fully paid for and fully consistent with the budget framework both parties agreed to just 18 months ago. Let me repeat – nothing I’m proposing tonight should increase our deficit by a single dime.  It’s not a bigger government we need, but a smarter government that sets priorities and invests in broad-based growth.”
Morgan StanleyMorgan Stanley's North America autos team led by Adam Jonas is optimistic about the U.S. auto market in 2013. "Together with Sandy replacement, fleet restocking and a housing led credit expansion, this should drive the SAAR higher to 16 mm in 2013," he wrote in a note recently.Â  This compares to 14.5 mm in 2012. This week, Jonas' team published its massive 98-slide US Auto Product Guidebook, one of the most comprehensive reviews of the U.S. auto market we have ever seen. We pulled the 11 most crucial charts.Â  They show us which models are hot, which ones are in short supply, and which ones have the highest costs of ownership. Thanks to Morgan Stanley for giving us permission to feature these charts.
Microsoft's history is filled with stories about its rough culture, from it's "stack-ranking" employee reviews to how Bill Gates used to yell, "That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard. Here's another one: Six-foot-two Steve Ballmer sometimes brings a baseball bat with him into meetings. And that's if he's feeling happy, says ex-Microsoft executive Joachim Kempin in an interview with ReadWriteWeb's Dan Lyons. "If heâ€™s having a really good day heâ€™s swinging a baseball bat. Do you think that sends a signal? Sometimes he brings it with him into the conference room," Kempin said. Ballmer isn't always so Robert-De-Niro-as-Al-Capone-in-the-Untouchables (remember that scene with the baseball bat?). He's also known to bounce a basketball through the halls, Kempin says. This isn't the first time we've heard tales of Ballmer's explosions. He famously threw a chair across the room in 2004 and shouted the f-bomb repeatedly when Google CEO Eric Schmidt poached a key engineer.Â  Then there's that story of how he damaged his vocal cords so bad he neeced surgery by furiously shouting ''Windows! Windows!'' at a sales meeting in Japan. Or the famous sweaty MonkeyBoy video (and its equally famous iPod mashup parody video)? It's all due to Ballmer's abundance of "nervous energy," Kempin says. "Heâ€™s not a bad guy. He just goes overboard sometimes." Worth noting, Kempin left Microsoft, and Ballmer's daily company, back in 2002, although he has been back to visit the CEO since then, he says.

Comcast is buying the remaining 49 percent of NBC Universal from GE for a$16.7 billion. And the market seems to think this is a win-win. Shares of Comcast are up 8 percent.   Shares of GE are up 4 percent.

Screenshot from CNBCApple's CEO Tim Cook addressed Greenlight Capital's CEO David Einhorn battle with his company this morning at the Goldman Sachs tech conference in San Francisco.  The tech giant's CEO called Greenlight's lawsuit a "silly sideshow."  Here's Greenlight's response that a spokesperson sent to CNBC, Scott Wapner reports:   "If Apple thinks the lawsuit is a waste of resources, it could simply end the matter by complying with existing law and filing a new proxy that unbundles the proposed changes to the charter so that the shareholders can express their views on each matter separately."  Last week, Einhorn's Greenlight took aim at Apple's massive cash reserves it has on its balance sheet last week saying it has a "Depression era mentality."  Greenlight said it's going to sue Apple in New York federal court to prevent a new proposal to prevent the issuance of preferred stock.  Shares of Apple were last trading down more than 2.4%.  SEE ALSO: Tim Cook Shreds Einhorn's Plan To Make Shareholders Billions Of Dollars &gt;

Today in a new blog postÂ for the Times, Broder writes that MuskÂ called him to apologize for his bad experience with the car, and agreed that the charging stations needed to be closer together. Broder had published aÂ review on Sunday of the electric car describing how its charge was unable to last the full journey between Washington and New York, and that it seemed the car did not respond well to the harsh Northeastern climate. In response, Musk went onÂ CNBCÂ toÂ slamÂ the review, calling it "fake" and saying that Broder had not begun his trip with a full charge, had taken detours and had sped in certain places. But in the blog post published today Broder says the tone does not jibe with the earlier conversation he'd had with Musk:Â  One final note. Mr. Musk called me on Friday, before the article went up on the Web, to offer sympathy and regrets about the outcome of my test drive. He said that the East Coast charging stations should be 140 miles apart, not 200 miles, to take into account the traffic and temperature extremes in this part of the country.

Kellan Elliott-McCrea, Etsy CTOWoman make up half of the workforce, yet only 4.2 percent of Fortune 500 CEOs are female.  That's a shocking percentage when you also consider that there are more women than men graduating from universities and graduate schools in America.  According to Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, we're in a "stalled revolution" for women.  Ultimately having fewer women at the top is bad business.  It's proven that companies perform better when they have more women on boards. "Women add their own perspectives, experience and knowledge to the board, which cannot be found any other way than by having gender diversity," says Carol Evans, CEO of theÂ National Association for Female Executives (NAFE). To identify the top companies that support women in leadership roles,Â NAFE recently compiled a list of the top 10 companies for women to work for right now, based off a survey that resulted in 200 applications. Here's the final list of companies and why they're great for women: 1. IBM Why it's great: Aside from having a female CEO,Â Ginni Rometty, this technology company has "more than 12,000 women that are considered part of the executive pipeline." Headquartered inÂ Armonk, N.Y., 30 percent of IBM'sÂ global workforce of 441,912 employees are women and 27 percent of them are senior managers. 2. Abbott Why it's great:Â "In 2011, there were 77 percent more women in executive management roles at Abbott than there were in 2001." Headquartered in Abbott Park, Ill., 49 percent of Abbott's workforce ofÂ 32,683 employees are women and 42 percent of them are senior managers. 3.Â AstraZeneca Why it's great:Â "Formal mentoring programs (live and virtual) support women with the potential to move into leadership roles." Headquartered in Wilmington, Del., 55 percent of AstraZeneca's workforce ofÂ 9,249 employees are women and 41 percent of them are senior managers. 4. General Mills Why it's great: "There are sponsorship initiatives that pair vice-president-and director-level advocates with promising female leaders in the manufacturing, information systems and engineering functions." Headquartered inÂ Minneapolis, Minn., 40 percent of General Mills' workforce ofÂ 16,939 employees are women and 37 percent of them are senior managers. 5. Johnson &amp; Johnson Why it's great: "Johnson &amp; Johnsonâ€™s Crossing the Finish Line program educates multicultural women and their supervisors about how to overcome barriers to advancement and accelerate their careers; in 2011, the programâ€™s offerings doubled." Headquartered inÂ New Brunswick, N.J., 47 percent of Johnson &amp; Johnson's workforce of 35,942 employees are womenÂ and 31 percent of them are senior managers. 6. KPMG Why it's great: "In a recent employee survey, 81 percent of the women who work for this audit, tax and advisory services firm said they had opportunities for learning and professional development." Headquartered in New York, N.Y., 47 percent of KPMG's workforce ofÂ 22,152 employees are women and 37 percent of them are senior managers. 7. Marriott International Why it's great: "The number of female corporate executives at Marriott International has increased 80 percent since 2002." Headquartered in Bethesda, Md., 55 percent of Marriott International's workforce ofÂ 100,412 employees are women and 40 percent of them are senior managers. 8. Proctor &amp; Gamble Why it's great: "Up-and-coming female employees also have access to valuable networking and coaching opportunities that can help advance them into key positions, largely due to the efforts of the companyâ€™s Corporate Womenâ€™s Leadership Team, comprised of senior female managers from every business function." Headquartered inÂ Cincinnati, Ohio, 43 percent of Proctor &amp; Gamble's workforce ofÂ 34,300 employees are women and 34 percent of them are senior managers. 9. Prudential Financial Why it's great: "Women not only represent the majority of employees studying for the firmâ€™s on-site MBA degree but also have increased their participation in executive coaching by at least 40 percent since 2010." Headquartered in Newark, N.J., 52 percent of Prudential Financial's workforce ofÂ 18,866 employees are women and 33 percent of them are senior managers. 10. State Farm Insurance Why it's great: "Women who are looking to refine their leadership skills participate in the companyâ€™s 194 employee resource groups or take advantage of its myriad mentoring opportunities, which help them accelerate their professional growth, manage the arc of their careers and navigate different cultures and generations." Headquartered inÂ Bloomington, Ill., 63 percent of State Farm Insurance's workforce ofÂ 63,258 employees are women and 40 percent of them are senior managers.Â 
ForbesWorldcrunch is a new global news service that for the first time delivers the best foreign-language journalism in English. SWEDEN â€“ Sagas are epic tales full of symbolic details, and the IKEA saga is no exception. The story of the Swedish furniture giant, founded in 1943 by Ingvar Kamprad, who is now 86 years old, definitely qualifies as a saga. It combines successes, setbacks and the carefully maintained mythology around the patriarch, who even though he is still active has taken a step back since he resigned as CEO in 1986. Today his role in the company is mostly advisory, but he still chairs the Kamprad family foundations. As he hands the reigns of the company down to the next generation â€“ his three sons â€“ questions arise on the issue of IKEAâ€™s sustainability, and Kampradâ€™s legacy. In Helsingborg, where IKEA's Swedish headquarters are located, Jeanette Skjelmose, in charge of sustainable development, praises Ingvar Kamprad and his intimate knowledge of the groupâ€™s every little detail. â€œIt is not uncommon to see him here.â€ Immediately, Ylva Magnusson, head of communications says nonchalantly: â€œHe is no longer in control, his role is to advise.â€ â€œI saw him recently during an IKEA store visit in Amsterdam,â€ says Skjelmose. â€œBut he visits less and less,â€ adds Magnusson. The head of communications is firmly intent on getting the message out that Ingvar Kamprad, the patriarch, is no longer in command of the company. She wants to make it clear that he is no longer indispensable to the smooth running of IKEA. In January, the company announced an annual profit of 3.2 billion euros, an 8% increase in this post-Kamprad era. Teflon Ingvar Getting things wrong, making mistakes is part of Kampradâ€™s nine commandments. In 70 years, his company has not been spared embarrassing revelations: child labor, secret foundations with billions of euros stashed in tax havens, destruction of primitive or protected forests, forced labor from political prisoners in East Germany, corruption in Russia, Ingvar Kampradâ€™s Nazi past in the 1940s and 1950s, spying on employees in France. The list is long â€“ and not complete. Some of these mistakes are directly attributable to Kamprad himself, and he has always gotten off the hook by making light of his weaknesses. Kamprad has sometimes been IKEAâ€™s worst enemy, but he was also its essence. Behind the scenes, IKEAâ€™s executives must manage this paradox â€“ using his image wisely, minimizing his presence, and only keeping his brilliance. No one disputes the old manâ€™s business skills or his encyclopedic memory. Equally legendary is his stinginess and the fact that he sometimes acts like a simpleton. â€œI have enough money to get by, he said, but the fact is that it is not me who has the money, itâ€™s the foundation.â€ Donâ€™t tell him he is Swedenâ€™s richest man. Johan Stenebo, one of IKEAâ€™s top executives for 20 years, including three as Kampradâ€™s right hand man, says that he does not know anyone smarter. Stenebo, who wrote a book called â€œThe Truth about IKEA: How IKEA Built Its Global Furniture Brand,â€ after resigning from his job after an argument with the Kamprad sons, says â€œIngvar Scrooge,â€ as some call him, has developed a particular skill for dodging issues. â€œWhen he is not around reporters, he never speaks about his problems,â€ says Johan Stenebo. â€œWith the media, he uses his personal problems as a smokescreen,â€ for instance his struggles with alcohol. Â Swedish people, who admire his success, have always forgiven him because he doesnâ€™t have the arrogance of other business leaders. He is always repentant and reserved, which helps a lot. IKEA, the next generation â€œOne wonders what will happen when Kampradâ€™s gone?â€ asks Susanne Sweet, an expert on corporate responsibility at the Stockholm School of Economics. â€œBecause the image of this farm boy from Smaland (Swedenâ€™s southern province) â€“ hardworking, thrifty, with all this mythology around him, close to the common folkâ€¦ the Kamprad sons, who grew up in a very different world, don't represent that at all. Do they have any of the same values of their father?â€ A photo illustrates perfectly the difficult question of IKEA's succession.Â  The photo was taken in 1998, during the traditional Christmas speech that Kamprad gives every year to the employees from the Almhult IKEA store. Kamprad, who is sitting on stage, is looking at his eldest son Peter, who is making the speech for the first time. Kamprad looks worried, while Peter looks absolutely terrified, giving his speech under the watchful and inquisitive eye of the patriarch. Would Peter be the one to take over the reigns of this global giant, with more than 150,000 employees? Would Peter and his brothers be up to the task? Kamprad has done nothing to make it easy for them. The photo was published in Aug. 2002, by the newspaper Smalandspost, with the headline: â€œKrampradâ€™s three sons take over IKEA.â€ The article, written by Bosse Vikingson, a reporter who had at the time already been following the IKEA saga for 15 years, sheds light on one of the mysteries of this discrete empire â€“ life after Ingvar. The order of succession between the founderâ€™s three sons finally seemed to be clarified. It was Peter Kamprad, who was 38 years old in 2002, who would succeed his father, according to the article. He would head the Stitching Ingka Foundation, the Dutch-registered foundation who owns Ingka Holding, the parent company for IKEA stores. His two brothers, Jonas and Mathias would also be a part of the adventure, Jonas on the design side and Mathias on the entrepreneurial side. Putting on a show A smooth succession? Not so sure. It was clear that none of the three sons would take on their fatherâ€™s omniscient role. Kamprad feared that his sons would one day tear each other apart. â€œI do not want my sons to compete against each other for the right to head the company. Sooner or later, I will have to name one,â€ he said in 1998. Since he started talking about his succession in the late 1970s, he has been planning things so that IKEA doesn't end up on the chopping blocks after his death, because of inheritance problems. â€œPeter Kempradâ€™s Christmas speech to IKEA employees was a harbinger signâ€ wrote Bosse Vikingson. Fifteen years after that photo, what has happened? One of Ingvar Kampradâ€™s last photos is from Autumn 2012, when the historic Almhult store was re-opened after its refurbishment. We see Kamprad shaking a few hands, smiling, but tightly controlled by a squad of collaborators. â€œHe is old now,â€ says Vikingson. â€œIKEA executives make sure he doesnâ€™t do too much, even if they cannot really tell him what to do.â€ For Christmas 2012, though, it was Kamprad who went up on stage to make his annual speech. Since that fated 1998 photo, Peter has never given another Christmas speech. The three brothers rarely appear in public, and when they do, it is strictly orchestrated. When they talk to journalists, the do not talk about themselves. In fact, they have only been interviewed once, for a book that was approved by Ingvar Kamprad. The three brothers are interviewed together, and we never find out who says what. For tax purposes For three and a half years, the spokesman for the father and his three sons is a Norwegian man called Per Heggenes. He tells Le Monde that all three sons have quit their operational roles in IKEA. So Peter will not become the head of the company. All three sons have made it clear that they want to work for the foundations. â€œBut they do not only sit for board meetings,â€ says Per Heggenes. â€œTheir role is to ensure that IKEAâ€™s culture and philosophy are transferred to the next generation.â€ Officially, the division of roles was made according to each brotherâ€™s interests and character. Jonas is the creative type. He trained as a designer and is interested in product development. Mathias, who is more business oriented, is interested in the global concept of the company. Peter, the economist, helped develop the Ikano bank, created by his father, and has decided to stay there. â€œThey prefer it this way, because it gives them the necessary distance to keep an eye on what is happening and make sure that the basic principles that made IKEA into the success it is are being followed,â€ says Heggenes. â€œEverything has been done to make sure IKEA lives on forever.â€ In reality, this complex construction is just destined for tax purposes â€“ and ensure the survival of IKEA after its founderâ€™s death â€“ even in the case of a disagreement between his sons.

FA Insights is a daily newsletter from Business Insider that delivers the top news and commentary for financial advisors. Pretty Much Everything Is A Good Bet Right Now (Bridgewater Associates, Bloomberg) Bridgewater's co-CIO Bob Prince recently told clients, "You want to be borrowing cash and hold almost anything against it," in a client conference call. Bridgewater is long equities around the world, and shifting to long commodities positions, said Prince. This is a clear indicator that the hedge fund is anticipating that the prices of various securities will rise. A few weeks ago at Davos, Ray Dalio, who runs Bridgewater, said that 2013 would be the year when large amounts of cash moved into markets, and that investors should position for price appreciation in risky assets. ETF Investors Are Avoiding Brazil (Wall St. Journal) In the three months through January Brazilian ETFs saw outflows of several hundred millions of dollars, according to Morningstar. U.S. investors are reducing their exposure to Brazilian ETFs because the country is lagging behind it's other Latin American counterparts. "Brazil has some strong cross currents that are developing into real head winds for investors," Paul Christopher, chief international investment strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors told the WSJ. "The bigger picture is that people are realizing there are other intriguing markets in Latin America," Lee Munson, chief investment officer at advisory firm Portfolio LLC told the WSJ. This Is How You Can Hedge For Inflation (iShares Blog) Investors don't really need to start worrying about inflation until 2014, but it's never too soon to develop and implement a strategy to hedge against it, according to CFA Russ Koesterich. He recommends natural resource and energy companies, international equity markets with large commodity exposure, physical real estate, and of course, gold as good hedges against inflation. However, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities might not be such a good idea, he says, "While TIPS will protect purchasing power, this protection comes at a hefty price. Real yields on TIPS are currently negative." Interest Rates Will Remain Low Around The World (Financial Advisor Magazine) According to PIMCO's head of global portfolio management Scott Mather, investors will likely see a long period of below-average interest rates in many regions of the world, thanks to a huge debt overhang. This effect will be more evident in developed nations, he said. Which is why investors should stay away from developed countries with activist central banks and high government debt, and instead increase exposure to countries that were seen as riskier in the past, but are now more financially sound than their more developed counterparts. "He said PIMCO believes that bond yields will remain constrained over the next several years, but that dislocations will occasionally occur in the different pockets of the fixed-income market." This Is Why High Yield Bonds Aren't Worth Buying (Economic Musings) Of late there's been a run on high yield (HY) bonds, which has resulted in a rally in both spread and price, said CFA David Schawel, in a blog post. â€œHigh yield is as overbought as I have ever seen it,â€ saidÂ Loomis Saylesâ€™s Dan Fuss, CFA, in his recent comments to Barron's. â€œThis is absolutely, from a valuation point, ridiculous.â€ Price appreciation for HY bonds have run their course, said Schawel. "HY bonds are starting to exhibit negative convexity, with prices exceeding 105 cents on the dollar. In other words, future price appreciation is capped because of the callability of the bonds."

Even if you're not getting out right at 4PM when the market closes, you're still looking to get a strong cocktail (or two) after work.

Here are some of the top spots for your happy hour fix this week.
High Frequency EconomicsThe return of an extremely dovish Prime Minister of Japan has caused the yen to tumble for weeks. However, not everyone is convinced that Japan's leaders will put their money where their mouth is. High Frequency Economics' Carl Weinberg thinks the idea that Japan will deliberately devalue the Yen is absurd: "Huffing and puffing is all governments can do to cheapen their currencies. Indeed, that is all we believe they are really doing. We see no evidence of central bank intervention in the markets on behalf of governments. This does not make for every competitive devaluation, eh?" So why is the Yen getting slammed? Even though they're not directly manipulating their currency, it doesn't mean that Japan's leaders aren't hoping for a cheaper yen. "Everyone in Japan, from the prime minister down, denies that they are acting to cause the yen to cheapen. Meanwhile, traders take one look at Prime Minister Abe-san's plans for more extensive quantities easing and they want to sell the yen like mad. This is a knee-jerk reaction that has no basis in the realities of QE. Students of Japan's exchange rate and central banking history know that the BoJ has been furiously buying government bonds for almost two decades. The whole time the yen has been appreciating, not depreciating." This is why this trend toward devaluation just can't last, according to Weinberg. "We view the yen's recent depreciation as a technical consolidation from a rally that started at Â¥ back in 2007 and peaked near Â¥76 in November last year. We do not see the move as the start of a sustained downtrend....Technicians are looking at Â¥94.19â€”this morning's levelâ€”as an important resistance point to the yen's correction of a five-year sustained rally. The yen may just stop falling at this level because everyone agrees that it should. If so, technicians would look for a resumption of the currency's overall appreciation." The exchange rate is a result of market action, not a policy tool, said Weinberg. "We think the yen's next protracted move will be stronger from present levels, not cheaper."
APThe ever-widening scandal that began with horse DNA found in Irish and British beef burgers has been blamed on a variety of things, including a Romanian "horse mafia", opaque supply chains and weakened legislation on the European meat industry. Writing in the Financial Times, Jamie Smyth posits a new theory — the influx of cheaper horse meat into the European beef supply chain can be directly linked to the 2008 financial crisis and its aftermath. Smyth uses the example of Ireland, where the "Celtic Tiger" years saw a rise in pet horses and sports horses, to back up the theory: The surge can be seen most easily in Ireland, which is home to a €1bn bloodstock industry and, with an estimated 110,000 sports horses, is the most horse dense country in Europe. In 2007, the country produced 12,633 thoroughbred foals, more than the combined total of France and the UK. But the economic crisis has yielded a growing number of unwanted horses, many of which are being slaughtered. Last year almost 25,000 horses were sent for slaughter at registered abattoirs and slaughter houses, up from just over 2,000 in 2008. The number of abandoned horses is also on the rise with 2,364 animals seized in 2010 by Irish authorities, treble the number five years earlier. Ireland wouldn't be the only example of course — Smyth lists similar trends in Spain and the UK (in the US horse slaughter is restricted and most horses are sent abroad to Canada and Mexico). It also seems likely that the Romanian "horse mafia" (the nickname criminal gangs reported to control the illicit trade in horse meat in the country by the British press) may well be a product of the dire economic times of the country's farmers — after 2008 Romania was plunged into a severe economic crisis, and was forced to rely on money from the IMF. An abundance of horses that were now too expensive to maintain meant there was an influx of horse meat into the European market. This coincided with the global supply of beef plateauing, and beef prices rising for six years.
Sports IllustratedWhen it comes to the markets, history tends to be a terrible guide. But assuming it is a good guide, then investors should be thrilled to see model Kate Upton on the cover of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit issue.Â  According to Art Cashin (via Carl Quintanilla), if an American model is chosen to grace the SI cover,Â the S&amp;P 500 will outperform historical returns. If the model has a different nationality it will underperform. Â  For instance, in 2011,Â Russian born Irina Shayk was on the cover and the market was volatile that year with the S&amp;P 500 finishing flat. So, things are looking up.
This is something people are starting to talk about in the blogosphere that should give all of Wall Street pause. Over at The Baseline Scenario, law professor James Kwak, says that what has been generally under-reported about the London Whale debacle is how badly Excel failed as a financial modeling program. It's all in JP Morgan's 129 page report on the $6 billion trading loss. In an appendix on page 127, the report talks about how one London-based quant was working on a new VaR (Value at Risk) model for the Chief Investment Office. On top of not being tested correctly, the report states that the model suffered from some pretty standard Excel flaws. From the report: During the review process, additional operational issues became apparent. For example, the model operated through a series of Excel spreadsheets, which had to be completed manually, by a process of copying and pasting data from one spreadsheet to another... in a January 23, 2012 e-mail to the modeler, the trader to whom the modeler reported wrote that he should â€œkeep the pressure on our friends in Model Validation and [Quantitative Research].â€ There is some evidence the Model Review Group accelerated its review as a result of this pressure, and in so doing it may have been more willing to overlook the operational flaws apparent during the approval process. There are some nuances about oversight and the analytic suite that the CIO was using, but the gist is this â€” volatility appeared lower than it should've because of issues with this model that can, in part, be traced back to how Excel was used. Wall Street uses Excel for everything, so this is pretty troubling, but it shouldn't be surprising. Excel is just like any program â€” numbers can get lost, equations can get written over and a user might not even notice. Kwak points out that when it comes to VaR models, if there's a mistake using Excel shows that there's more at risk than there actually is, banks will act. If a mistake using Excel shows that there's less at risk than there actually is, banks can run into a problem. For Kwak's full take, head to The Baseline Scenario&gt;
According to the latest Monthly Treasury Statement, the U.S. posted a budget surplus of $2.88 billion in January.Â  Economists surveyed by Bloomberg were expecting a deficit of $2.0 billion. According to Reuters, this is the first January budget surplus in five years. Receipts were $272.2 billion while the spending was $269.3 billion.Â  This is important to remember, because budget deficits and surpluses aren't just about spending levels.Â  Indeed, growth plays just as important a role. Economists have been expecting the January report to benefit from the recent expiration of the payroll tax cut.Â  However, this report nevertheless surpassed expectations. Just last week, the Congressional Budget Office forecasted that the U.S. budget deficit would fall to $845 billion this year, which would be the first reading under $1 trillion in five years.Â  Today's surprise surplus should reinforce optimism that we'll actually get there. As GDP grows, the deficit shrinks.Â  To better understand this, read this and this. Here's a look at some historical numbers from the Monthly Treasury Statement. Treasury Treasury

  (Note: Since the embedded video does not appear to be working, you can watch the clip here.) CNBC anchor Michelle Caruso-Cabrera challenged House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) to admit Tuesday that the nation has a "spending problem" ahead of President Barack Obama's State of the Union address tonight. Caruso-Cabrera didn't buy Hoyer's argument that Obama has been willing to work toward compromise, and she brought up the direct question of whether the nation has a spending problem — something that has gained more attention since House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi rejected the assertion on Sunday. Hoyer circled around the question in his answer, saying the nation instead has a "paying-for problem."  "We haven't paid for what we've bought," Hoyer said. "Are we promising too much?" Caruso-Cabrera said. "Absolutely," Hoyer conceded. "If we don’t pay, we shouldn't buy." "How is that different from a spending problem?" she said. "You know, we spent a lot of money when George Bush was President of the United States," Hoyer said.  The Republican National Committee circulated Hoyer's comments along with Pelosi's, calling Hoyer "the latest Dem to refuse to say we have a spending problem."
By EconMattersSeaway Pipeline or Garden HoseThis is hilarious if prices weren`t so damn high, but despite a robust export market for finished products, crude oil is backing up all the way to Cushing, Oklahoma, and is only going to get worse in 2013. Now that Enterprise Products Partners LLP has let the cat out of the bag that less than a month after expanding the Seaway pipeline capacity to 400,000 barrels per day, The Jones Creek terminal has storage capacity of 2.6 million barrels, and it is basically maxed out in available storage.  How bad would capacity constraints be without a booming export market?So good thing there is an export market for US finished petroleum products or oil and gas prices would be much lower, as in the US, demand is so low relative to supply, that you almost cannot give the stuff away, and the refiners still cannot utilize all the oil that Cushing needs to send to alleviate their escalating storage issues which stand at 52 million barrels and climbing. Econmatters 60 Million Storage in Cushing to be tested in 2013Expect Cushing oil inventories to pass the 60 million threshold, and let`s watch how price reacts to that level. My first reaction is that a whole bunch of spread tightening trades will have to be unwound throughout the oil curve. My second reaction is that the $30 premium for Brent over WTI is now on the table for 2013. Econmatters What happens when Cushing is full?What happens if Cushing reaches complete capacity levels in 2013, does the oil back up further along the supply chain? A nasty logistics nightmare is beginning to play out for producers, now where do you send the oil? At any rate, WTI Oil is probably going to be going much lower from here, and the 2013 average will be well below current market prices. Econmatters 175,000 versus 400,000Now back to what Enterprise said regarding the oil backup, citing "unforeseen constraints" in reducing deliveries to 175,000 barrels a day from 400,000 barrels a day at its Jones Creek terminal in Freeport, Texas. Enterprise added that maximum storage levels at the terminal have been reached.  Seller`s Market for Storage BuildingThis is just hilarious, and is something that we touched upon before that there is so much oil coming out of the ground currently and for the next decade that much more storage capacity is going to be required throughout the country. Basically, the refiners need to build more onsite storage facilities, the terminals need to build more onsite storage facilities, Cushing Oklahoma needs to increase its storage facilities, and the oil fields themselves are going to need to build onsite storage facilities, as the entire supply chain is backing up right now like a clogged plumbing pipe in your house. Too bad for Consumers, supply levels don`t match the Market pricesThis is just hilarious, especially given the supply disconnect with the price right now in WTI. But how could this have not been foreseen by the pipeline operators? I get it domestic supply is more than your outdated models planned for, and refinery demand even with exports cannot use all the freakin oil, and now you are stuck with an underutilized asset that doesn`t work as good as rails at getting around storage constraint issues.  I would love to be a fly on the wall for this conversationHow do you explain this one to upper management? Well bossâ€¦â€¦I know we just expandedâ€¦â€¦..wellâ€¦umâ€¦.we thought thatâ€¦â€¦this has to be a sick joke right? Nobody could be this bad at modeling demand/ logistical constraints for their expensive expansion project! After five minutes of casual thinking I thought this was going to be a problem, was this even considered in the project analysis report? Did they really have to run it at full 400,000 for a week to discover this issue? Talk about keystone cops, the picture in my head of the â€œlight bulb momentâ€ when someone realized the supply constraint issue on the ground and had to report this up the chain of command is just priceless right now!Â Â© EconMatters All Rights Reserved | Facebook | Twitter | Post Alert | Kindle     Read more posts on EconMatters Â»
Bloomberg via YouTube Nowadays on Wall Street, when you go to war, you present your case... thoroughly. So naturally, the battle between hedge fund manager Jason Ader (and his allies) and IGT (the biggest slot machine company in the world) is no exception. Ader, who owns 3% of IGT, started a fight when he wrote a letter to IGT's management saying that he wanted to replace four (now three) of the company's board members (check out his Rescue IGT website here). IGT has answered with a resounding 'no', and since the company services some of the biggest names in the casino world, Las Vegas' elite are being forced to pick sides or get out of the way. Steve Wynn, for example, is throwing his weight behind Ader, Sheldon Adelson has chosen to stay out of the way. On to Ader's argument. He says that IGT lacks good corporate governance and that the three board members he wants to replace lack experience in financial markets and/or the casino industry. He also says that the company has been throwing away money senselessly. For example, IGT acquired online gaming company DoubleDown for $500 million, and he believes IGT could've made a similar product for $50-60 million. See if you agree.
U.S. farm income is projected to rise 14 percent to $128.2 billion in 2013, the highest level since 1973, according to the latest report from the USDA. If yields returned to trend, crop production would reach record levels and cause a drop in inventories. "This would lead to higher net farm income since this measure goes beyond cash income to include the value of inventory change and other noncash items."Net cash income (the difference between cash expenses and commodities sold and other farm income) is expected to be $123.5 billion. That's only the fourth time since 1973 that net cash income has been over $100 billion.  "Today's forecast for the strongest net farm income in four decades is another positive testament to the resilience and productivity of U.S. farmers and ranchers," Tom Vilsack said in a press release.  "American agriculture continues to endure an historic drought with tremendous resolve, and last year was an important reminder of the need for a strong safety net." Here are some details from the report: Here's a look at the trajectory of farm income since 2013: USDA
Michael Kors just announced it quadrupled profits in the last year, an amazing feat in the struggling economy.  The brand utilized consumer one insight that helped it excel while aspirational competitors like Tiffany &amp; Co. and Coach have struggled.  Michael Kors succeeded because it was the first retailer to hit the market's sweet spot: people with money to spend but who aren't rich. Luxury marketing expert Pam Danziger calls these people HENRYs, for "High Earners Not Rich Yet." They are the people who make between $100,000 and $250,000, she says. HENRYs are a growing segment, while the wealthiest people are making less than they used to. Danziger explained the concept to us in an emailed note: Ultra-affluent (i.e. those at the top 2 percent of U.S. households with incomes starting at $250,000) cut their spending by nearly 30 percent from 2010, while the HENRYs (High Earners Not Rich Yet with incomes $100,000-$249,999) increased their spending on luxury by some 11 percent from 2009 levels. Even though HENRYs individually have a far lower spending threshold than ultra-affluent customers, there are nearly ten HENRY households for every ultra-affluent. That is why with a total of 21.3 million households, the HENRY segment is a critically important part of the consumer market. With Michael Kors' $450 handbags and $250 watches, HENRYs can show off their success without feeling like they're going overboard. Kors, like his competitor Tory Burch, wisely chose the right audience. It's paying off. 
We are just one month into 2013, and investors have already seen the relentless run in high-yield (HY) bonds continue. Despite a backup in the last week of January, HY has notched a total return of 1.39% so far this year, using the JPM US HY index data. This has been a rally in terms of both spread and absolute price. HY spreads have contracted from 613 basis points in mid-November to 513 basis points on February 1. Loomis Sayles’s Dan Fuss, CFA, held little back in his recent comments to Barron’s: “High yield is as overbought as I have ever seen it,” Fuss said. “This is absolutely, from a valuation point, ridiculous.” When a person like Fuss makes comments that strong, it’s worth digging a little deeper. Let’s look at two characteristics of the HY market that have changed over the past few years without many investors realizing it.  Price appreciation has largely run its course As we see from the chart, HY bonds are starting to exhibit negative convexity, with prices exceeding 105 cents on the dollar. In other words, future price appreciation is capped because of the callability of the bonds. As Loomis Sayles’s Matt Eagan, CFA, said in an interview last month, HY bonds don’t typically trade at higher than par plus half their coupon. Well, guess what? We are at that place today. Looking back at the previous few years of performance in the HY market is dangerous and unrealistic for investors attempting to project potential future returns. I  am not a financial writer giving you predictions but, rather, pointing out indisputable features of bond math.   Read the rest at Advisor Perspectives &gt;
YouTube screengrabRay DalioRay Dalio, who runs the world's biggest hedge fund at Bridgewater Associates, said a few weeks ago at Davos that 2013 would be the year when large amounts of cash moved into markets, and that investors should position for price appreciation in risky assets. Today, Bloomberg's Kelly Bit has details from one of the secretive firm's recent client conference calls, which fleshes out the firm's bullish thesis in a bit more detail. Bit says that on the call, Bridgewater co-CIO Bob Prince told clients, "You want to be borrowing cash and hold almost anything against it." The firm's key thesis is that the big move out on the risk spectrum â€“ meant to be induced by central bank easing as investors search for yield opportunities â€“ hasn't even happened yet. However, investor behavior clearly signals a desire for yield opportunities, which is why Prince says it won't even take much economic growth to light a fire under risky assets. Bit writes: Bridgewater is â€œlong equities around the worldâ€ and â€œgenerally shifting to long commodities positions,â€ Prince said during the call. Hedge funds that make long bets are anticipating the prices of various securities will rise. The firm also has a â€œmoderate long position in developed market corporate credit,â€ he said. Bridgewater is positive on currencies including the British pound, Korean won, Mexican peso and Russian ruble, according to a chart in the transcript showing the firmâ€™s current views, which Prince referred to during the call. The firm is bearish on the Japanese yen, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar, the chart shows. Read the rest at Bloomberg &gt;
Annie Lowrey at The NYT has a story that is of utmost importance. It's about the bombshell news that the growth spending on healthcare is in rapid decline. In figures released last week, the Congressional Budget Office said it had erased hundreds of billions of dollars in projected spending on Medicare and Medicaid. The budget office now projects that spending on those two programs in 2020 will be about $200 billion, or 15 percent, less than it projected three years ago. New data also show overall health care spending growth continuing at the lowest rate in decades for a fourth consecutive year. Health experts say they do not yet fully understand what is driving the lower spending trajectory. But there is a growing consensus that changes in how doctors and hospitals deliver health care â€” as opposed to merely a weak economy â€” are playing a role. Still, experts sharply disagree on where spending might be in future years, a question with major ramifications for the federal deficit, family budgets and the overall economy. You know all of those charts you see from folks like John Boehner and Paul Ryan? They all rest on the premise of explosive, un-trammeled healthcare inflation.  If healthcare inflation numbers continue their deceleration, then you should rip up these charts. This story has been bubbling up for awhile. Last year, former Obama budget chief Peter Orszag named the slowdown in Medicare spending as his Chart Of The Year. S&P All of the U.S. debt doom charts are about healthcare inflation. That dissipates â€” new ballgame. Read Annie's full story here &gt;
The brain behind Capital IQ, the financial database service that was sold to McGraw Hill in 2004 for over $200 million, has a new product for Wall Street, Deal Book reports. Capital IQ co-founder Neal Goldman has created a new company called Relationship Science that acts like a 6 degrees of separation for Wall Street's elite. It costs $3,000 a year to get a subscription, and some major investors are loving the idea. From Dealbook: Here’s how it works: Let’s say a banker wants to get in touch with Mr. Kravis, the private equity deal maker, but doesn’t know him personally. The banker can type Mr. Kravis’s name into a Relationship Science search bar, and the system will scan personal contacts for people the banker knows who also know Mr. Kravis, or perhaps secondary or tertiary connections... Kenneth Langone, a financier and co-founder in Home Depot, said that when he saw a demonstration of the system he nearly fell off his chair. He used an unprintable four-letter word. “My life is all about networking,” said Mr. Langone, who was so enthusiastic he became an investor and recently joined the board of Relationship Science. “How many times do I say, ‘How do I get to this guy?’ It is scary how much it helps.” Henry R. Kravis, Ronald O. Perelman, Joseph R. Perella, Stanley F. Druckenmiller and Andrew Tisch have joined Langone in supporting the project financially. It is, after all, about who you know.

usawatchdog via YouTubeTalks of a farmland bubble have been in the headlines for at least a year. In 2011 Project Syndicate column, economist and bubble-expert Robert Shiller had warned that farmland was his "favorite dark-horse bubble candidate for the next decade or so". For now, Shiller isn't convinced that it's a bubble. In an interview with CNBC, he pointed out that farmland was missing some tell-tale signs of a bubble. "Why don't people talk about that (farmland bubble). Especially in the Midwest just last year farm prices were up over 20 percent. It doesn't have all the hallmarks of a bubble. One of them is most people have never heard of it. In my view of a bubble it's something that gets people excited. well, some people are excited. But most people don't even know about it." He also pointed out that a USDA study he had read didn't show "dramatic evidence of a bubble" in farmland. He pointed out the fact that rents on farmland were increasing, which added to signs that this might be an "overreaction" rather than a bubble. "There are things driving rents up. Notably biofuels are becoming more important and not just biofuels but plastics and other things that are made out of soybeans and corn," he said. "There is a world food shortage that has been remarked about in the world food market that has been remarked about in the newspapers. All these things are fundamentals that might well drive farmland up. Now it seems to me very vitally the world could overreact to that but I can't prove that." Furthermore, he also said he doesn't think credit standards are too easy for farmland. "I doubt it the way banks are lending. Not everything is driven by credit. In fact you know that's one reason to doubt that the farmland epidemic will really be huge bubble, because banks are more cautious now." Watch the entire interview at CNBC:    
As many of 708 private equity firms are facing a brutal deadline â€” attract investors over the next few years or face fee reductions, Bloomberg reports. From 2006 to 2008, PE attracted $702 billion in investment capital. However, since the financial crisis crushed their returns, investors have been moving their money elsewhere. Only the strongest funds will be able to fund raise adequately, and some estimate that 10-25% of PE shops will shut down. Even the big boys are hurting here, (from Bloomberg): Blackstoneâ€™s $21.7 billion fund from 2006 had a 2 percent net annualized internal rate of return as of Dec. 31, according to a Blackstone regulatory filing. TPGâ€™s boom-era funds -- an $18.9 billion vehicle raised in 2008 and a $15.4 billion vehicle from 2006 -- were generating returns of 2.5 percent and a negative 4.9 percent annually as of June 30, according to the California Public Employeesâ€™ Retirement System, a TPG investor. KKRâ€™s annual return on its $17.6 billion fund from 2006 was 6.9 percent as of Sept. 30. That combination of underperformance and funding needs has set the stage for a purge as investors pull the plug on the weakest firms. Only the scope of a shake-out is a matter of debate. â€œThere will be some carnage,â€ said Jay Fewel, a senior investment officer for the $73.5 billion Oregon state pension fund in Salem, Oregon, which has been investing in private equity for more than 30 years. â€œA lot of folks raised money in the mid-2000s, when it was pretty easy. Now there are probably too many funds out there.â€ Sounds like PE shops are suffering from the same problem people say the hedge fund industry is suffering from â€” over saturation.

Business Insider's Jay Yarow is live blogging Apple CEO Tim Cook's talk at the Goldman Sachs technology conference in San Francisco.  Cook is ripping into hedge fund manager David Einhorn, the founder of Greenlight Capital who took aim at Apple's massive cash reserves it has on its balance sheet last week saying it has a "depression era mentality."  Greenlight said it's going to sue Apple in New York federal court to prevent a new proposal to prevent the issuance of preferred stock. Here's Cook's reponse from Yarow's live blog:   Cook: Apple doesn't have depression era mentality. Apple makes bold product bets. Last year $10 billion CapEx, do the same this year, investing in R&amp;D, new products, supply chain, we're acquiring some companies. I think it's hard ... or at least my definition wouldn't include investing a pair of 10s over two years, and $45 billion back to shareholders, I don't know how a company with despression era mindset would have done all those things. Now, we do have some cash, but it's a privlige to be in this position. That we can seriously consider returning additional cash to our sharholders. Management team and the board in very active discussion, we will do so thoughtfully. And more on the lawsuit...   Cook: It centers on Prop 2. Right of shareholders. It's not about whether returns additional cash to sharholders, not about how much to return to shareholders, not about mechanism to return it, it's about the right of shareholders. In 2012, we were looking at what we could do to improve goverence, one item that came out was we should eliminate a blank check preferred. Not that Apple can release preferred, but if we do it we need to go to our common shareholders. Frankly, I find it bizarre that we would be sue for doing something that would be good for shareholders. It's a silly sideshow. Continued...  You're not going to see a yes on 2 sign in my front yard. It's a waste of shareholder money. I support prop 2, I think it's the right thing for shareholders to have the right on this, I encourage others to vote on it. but, it's not something we're going to spend cycles on. The serious thing is the return of cash, how to do it, and we're serious about that. Prop 2 a silly sideshow. We feel so strongly that for Apple that shareholders should approve an issuance of preferred stock that common shareholders, we would go for a vote regardless. That's the way I see it.

"This is not a fluke: almost all of the underlying determinants of inflation point to weakness," writes BofA Merrill Lynch economist Ethan Harris in a note to clients today. For all of the talk of rising government bond yields and predictions for when the Federal Reserve will taper back its bond buying, Harris says, deflation is still a bigger risk than higher inflation – and disinflation could cause the Fed to actually ramp up QE if it continues. Several key measures of inflation are actually headed lower, and have yet to bottom out, according to Harris. "This, along with the fiscal shock, is a good reason to fade the bond market sell-off," he writes. The chart below shows Core CPI, Core PPI, Median CPI (calculated by the Cleveland Fed), Core PCE, and Trimmed PCE (calculated by the Dallas Fed). Bloomberg, Business Insider Harris cites six forces weighing on inflation, summarized below: Harris says he expects that "inflation bounces around the Fed’s 2% target, with no clear trend over the next two years," but warns: However, if recent trends continue, we will have to revisit that forecast. If this downdraft sticks, it has important implications for the long-awaited bond sell-off. Lower inflation should not only put downward pressure on breakevens, it will encourage the Fed to stick to its QE program longer. If outright deflation threatens, the Fed could even ramp up its program. More QE – imagine that.
Sheryl Sandberg has quickly become an icon in the debate over women in the workplace. At Business Insider's IGNITION conference last year, she said that the most important career decision women make is whom they decide to marry.Â She also believes thatÂ we are in a "stalled revolution"Â for women.Â  She talks about these and other controversial issues in her new book, "Lean In: Women, Work and the Will To Succeed," which comes out next month. We've read the advance copy and have highlighted the best points below: Women need to take more responsibility for their success Sandberg argues that the biggest barrier between women and success is themselves: "I know some believe that by focusing on what women can change themselves â€” pressing them to lean in â€” it seems like I am letting our institutions off the hook. Or even worse, they accuse me of blaming the victim. Far from blaming the victim, I believe that female leaders are key to the solution." Societal norms and gender stereotypes have influenced how women "should" act for decades, but it's up to women to redefine expectations, says Sandberg. This means actively "sitting at the table" and taking action rather than being observers in their careers.Â SheÂ gives a great example of what happened during a meeting with then-Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner at Facebook a few years ago: "Secretary Geitner's team, all women, took their food last and sat in chairs off to the side of the room. ... [They] had every right to be at this meeting, but because of their seating choice, they seemed like spectators rather than participants." Too many women get caught up in the "tiara syndrome," she says, where they expect to get rewarded for good work rather than seizing opportunities. The only way to change the game is by "taking risks, choosing growth, challenging ourselves, and asking for promotions."Â  It comes down to having more self-confidenceÂ  Self confidence is at the heart of what it means to lead, take risks and become powerful.Â  It also comes easier for men.Â Sandberg talks about how even "to this day, I joke that I wish I could spend a few hours feeling as self-confident as my brother. It must feel so, so good â€” like receiving a cosmic flat one every day." The same is true for her husband, Dave Goldberg â€” even amidst all of her success, she still describes him as more self-confident.Â  Sandberg says that she observed how acutely gender dynamics can play out during a Q&amp;A session at Harvard Business School: "A number of men leapt to the microphone and posed thoughtful, big-picture questions like, 'What did you learn at Google that you are applying at Facebook?' and 'How do you run a platform company and ensure stability for your developers?' Then two women rose to the microphone. The first asked, 'Do you think it's OK to work for a company that competes with the company you worked for before business school?' The second asked, 'How can I get a mentor?' My heart sank. The men were focusing on how to manage a business and the women were focusing on how to manage a career. The men wanted answers and the women wanted permission and help." At the end of the day, many women need to think more ambitiously and see the bigger picture. "It's hard to visualize someone as a leader, if she is always waiting to be told what to do," Sandberg says. Women should not ask for mentors Sandberg says that she's often been put in the awkward position of being asked to be a mentor to near strangers: "If someone has to ask the question, the answer is probably no."Â Instead, the logic everyone â€” both women and men â€” should use is, "excel and you will find a mentor."Â  Mentors and sponsors are crucial to success. But the relationships should develop more naturally and be more reciprocal than anything else.Â  Sandberg talks about how Larry Summers become a mentor for her: "During my junior year of college, I took Larry Summers's public sector economics class. He offered to supervise my senior thesis â€” something very few Harvard professors volunteer to do for undergraduates. Larry has been a major part of my life ever since."Â  Sandberg says she's had several great male mentors in addition to Larry Summers.Â She creditsÂ Eric Schmidt for telling her years ago "not to be an idiot" and always to take jobs based on potential for growth (not stability), andÂ Mark Zuckerberg for saying that you can't please everyone â€” that will only hold you back. Men must be open to changeÂ  While women need to take responsibility for themselves, men of course also play a big role in creating a more equal world. Often it simply starts with a conversation. Sandberg shares a story about how she askedÂ Sergey Brin to make a change at Google after a difficult morning running through parking lots while pregnant:Â  "I found Sergey in a yoga position in the corner [of his office] and announced that we needed pregnancy parking, preferably sooner than later. He looked up at me and agreed immediately, noting that he had never thought about it before." Marriage should be 50/50 Beyond having male advocates in the workplace, it's crucial to have an equal partnership at home, says Sandberg:Â "I truly believe that the single most important career decision that a woman makes is whether she will have a life partner and who that partner is. I don't know of a single woman in a leadership position whose life partner is not fully â€” and I mean fully â€” supportive of her career. No exceptions." "Having it all" is a myth Even with an equal partner at home, "having it all" is impossible, she argues. The "basic laws of economics and common sense" ensure that there will always be tradeoffs.Â Embracing a healthy lifestyle and accepting a support network is essential to coming as close to "having it all" as anyone can get. But at the end of the day, Sandberg says one of her favorite mottos isÂ "done is better than perfect" (which is also prominently displayed on the walls at Facebook): "I have tried to embrace this motto and let go of unattainable standards. Aiming for perfection causes frustration at best and paralysis at worst." Â Â  There's still a lot of work to do Sandberg says we've still got an incredibly long way to go. She uses statistics to back this up: While women have made up 50 percent of college grads since the 1980s, they are still paid only 77 cents to the dollar. They also only make up 21 of Fortune 500 CEOs.Â  "A truly equal world would be one where women ran half our countries and companies and men ran half our homes," she says. "I believe that this would be a better world."
As the credit markets froze during the height of the financial crisis, companies who relied on the short-term debt markets to finance their day-to-day operations quickly learned the importance of having liquidity on their books in the form of cash.  Even the healthiest companies found themselves struggling to pay their employees due to the credit crunch. However, the financial markets have improved significantly since the crisis. Bank of America Merrill Lynch's Michael Hartnett just published this chart showing investors' evolving attitudes toward corporate cash. And it tells us everything. As you can see from the dotted line, during the financial crisis, investors wanted companies to use their cash flows to slash debt and build up their cash positions. After the crisis, we were left with a global economy in critical condition with limited growth prospects. As you can see from black line trending up, investors wanted their shareholder value returned in the form of dividends and buybacks. But in more recent months, you can see a burst of optimism manifesting in the blue line, which represents the desire for more capital expenditures.  In other words, investors want companies to take some risk and invest in growth. This is a very clear shift in investors attitudes toward cash deployment. Bank Of America Merrill Lynch
Indeed, some studies have found that a surprising number of centenarians smoke, drink and live dangerously. Yet, most scientists and laymen alike would agree that they can best extend the years of their lives (and, yes, the life in their years) by not smoking and not drinking. In my view, the same logic applies to the integration of environmental, social, governance (ESG) and forensic accounting research into the analysis of issuer risk. Check out 13 big companies with bad ESG scores &gt; For the most part, this expansion of traditional approaches to investment analysis is continuing steadily. But we still see some evidence of lingering resistance to this inevitability. Here, Iâ€™d like to address some of the misconceptions that fuel this resistance. No doubt, these misconceptions are weakening and receding from the forefront. Still, Iâ€™ll offer a few observations here to help speed their passage to the dustbin. 1. Corporate character matters. Thereâ€™s value in values. Ignoring values can destroy value. I dedicated the past 10 years of my career to the development of two areas of research â€“ ESG and forensic accounting â€“ that, in my view, have already moved the financial community toward a healthier, humbler and more holistic understanding of issuer risk. Investors, insurers and other market participants are employing â€œextra-financialâ€ research in part because they see that it can help them improve performance, whether itâ€™s the performance of an equity portfolio, a D&amp;O insurance policy or a fixed-income strategy. Over the past year, we published broad-ranging research findings that corroborate this claim (see summary here). Bob Monksâ€™ upcoming book will bring fresh ideas to this growing body of research. Still, we occasionally hear dismissive arguments that challenge the relevance of non-traditional research. True, the critics say, ESG risk metrics may capture aspects of corporate behavior that deviate from purist notions of justice, equity and fiduciary duty. But how materially do these departures from ideals really affect performance and profit? After all, some of the ESG anathemas â€” e.g., dual-class shares, combined CEO/Chair positions, rewards for failure, ignored shareholder votes â€” are so common. Â Should we really get worked up about these bugbears? At earlier stages in the evolution of ESG research, this question might have resonated more broadly. Back then, ESG still focused on values more than value. It treated the two goals as mutually antithetical. GMI has long distinguished itself by focusing on the value of values. From this vantage point, hereâ€™s what weâ€™ve found that should change the mind of any reasonable skeptic: 2. Risk modeling is not prediction. The former is an earnest attempt to make thoughtful decisions in the context of complex uncertainty. The latter is a centerpiece in Wall Streetâ€™s media-fueled culture of â€œpropheteeringâ€. We see mounting evidence about the relevance of ESG/AGR research to the decisions of all market participants exposed to issuer risk. But this research also invites questions about â€œfalse positives,â€ companies that perform well despite their poor ESG or accounting ratings. The simple answer to this question is to acknowledge the obvious: no one knows the future. No statistical risk model works perfectly â€” not in finance, or medicine, or economics or any area of life ever scrutinized through the prism of statistics. We can only observe regularities and the rhythms of emerging and dissolving patterns. We can humbly model risk. We can never predict the future. According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), smoking increases the risk of lung cancer by 23 times in men and by 13 times in women. The CDC also tells us that excessive alcohol use is responsible for an average of about 30 years of potential life lost (YPLL). Yet, you can find a handful of chain-smoking, binge-drinking risk-takers who manage to live in good health for more than a century. The bottom line here is that colorful exceptions do not alter the dominant regularity: smoking still kills. Similarly, poorly governed companies whose accounting practices distort the economic value of the enterprise expose investors to material and avoidable risks. 3. In Conclusion: When paradigms shift, shift with them. Obsolete ideas donâ€™t always die peacefully. Long after theyâ€™ve outlived their usefulness, they still cling to life and resist the rise of superior ideas. Modern finance can be prey to obsolete ideas sustained by nothing but the force of cultural and institutional inertia. This will change because it is now in the best economic interest of every individual market participant to broaden his or her idea of risk and value. In the history of progressive ideas that succeed in the struggle for survival, we find a common pattern. The idea starts out on the subversive fringe. It attracts followers and believers. It builds political power and soon achieves mainstream respectability. In the final stage, the idea gets woven into the cultural fabric. It starts to sound obvious, and it helps change institutional and individual behaviors and habits of mind. Arguably, ESG/AGR has not yet entered this final stage characterized by broad mainstream consensus. In my view, this consensus is inevitable because the evidence is overwhelming, and so is the need for change.

White House Flickr Tonight Obama delivers The State Of The Union, and naturally everyone is chiming in with advice on what he says. If he read the Washington Post, he'd get some conflicting advice on what to say about the deficit. Washingtonpost.com Chris Cilizza says that the deficit is THE issue of the day, and encourages Obama to devote the majority of his speech to it, basically on the grounds that it polls well. It’s the deficit, stupid. A look back at Obama’s first three State of the Union speeches, plus the address to a joint session of Congress in 2009, suggests a similar thematic pattern: He starts with the economy, moves to education and then, in the middle section of the speech, addresses the deficit. (The exception was in 2011, when Obama began his speech with a riff on partisanship.) In 2012, Obama spent just five minutes on the debt — less time than he spent on partisanship (51/ 2 minutes) or foreign policy (six minutes). He should flip that script in this State of the Union and spend the bulk of his time talking about the deficit. Here’s why: In January 2009 polling by Pew Research Center, 53 percent of respondents said reducing the deficit was a “top priority.” In January 2013, that number soared to 72 percent, by far the biggest increase of any issue over that time. (By contrast, 85 percent said strengthening the economy was a top priority in 2009, while 86 percent said so at the start of this year.) The debt is the issue of the day, and one that, if Obama is beginning to eye his legacy as president, could go a long way toward shaping how history remembers him. Make this speech a deficit speech. Jamelle Bouie argues that the focus must remain on growth, and that creating growth will take care of the deficit. With growth, the economy can deal with high debt and deficits, at least in the medium-term. Continued commitment to austerity, on the other hand, will threaten our economic trajectory and harm our effort to reinvest in the United States. If Obama wants to do the prudent, serious thing, he’ll ignore the hawks, and stop worrying about the deficit. Bouie is certainly right on substance, that the priority needs to be growth, and not austerity. But the key thing is that it's not enough to make growth the focus. The deficit discussion needs to be avoided entirely. Not one word. In an interview earlier this year with Business Insider, Rep. Jerry Nadler explained that when Obama talks about "balanced approach" to dealing with the economy, he's already losing the argument, because he's making the implicit acknowledgment that deficits are a problem. Sure, liberals might have a different idea about how to close the deficit than conservatives do, but it's still not helpful to buy into the deficit hawk frame. I think the problem is, it’s practically impossible to get the public to buy that, as long as the president doesn’t. If the president buying into the notion that the deficit is a big problem or that we’re going to have a grand bargain... Do we revenues as well as cuts, but still do cuts. ... I think the president seems to have ceded the basic argument. And that’s a problem for all of us. Because when the presidents sets the basic terms of the argument, that defines sort of the outer limit to a lot of extent. Nadler's comments echo the line of thinking from Nomura economist Richard Koo, who even cautions against long-term deficit reduction talk: The insistence that fiscal consolidation is necessary in the longer term is like the doctor who, faced with a patient who has just been admitted to the intensive care ward, repeatedly questions the patient about his ability to afford the treatment. This is both lacking in decency and irresponsible.If the patient loses heart after learning the cost of the treatment, he may end up spending even longer in the hospital, leading to a larger final bill. Completely ignoring the policy duration effect of fiscal policy and constantly insisting on longer-term fiscal consolidation was what prolonged Japan’s recession The deficit is shrinking at a pace faster than any period since WWII, as Jed Graham notes in a brilliant chart at IBD. IBD The deficit is shrinking rapidly. But growth isn't happening fast enough. Rather than talk about a balanced approach to deficit reduction, Obama needs to ignore the issue completely.
Low capital expenditures, decelerating corporate growth and a global economy that's improving at a snails pace are the metrics that are most responsible for anemic growth in the U.S.. This is according to a recent report by Fidelity's Dirk Hofschire and Lisa Emsbo-Mattingly. On the upsideâ€”the housing market, manufacturing, credit, and improving labor fundamentals. Here is Fidelity's scorecard of U.S. economic indicators: Fidelity Investments What this means is that the U.S. is currently in slow expansion mode. But impending partisan fiscal debates could cause short term volatility write Hofschire and Emsbo-Mattingly. From the report: "While policy risks continue to populate the headlines, the overall trend during the past 18 months has been the gradual receding of systemic risk. In the U.S., the ongoing fiscal debate is still creating uncertaintyâ€”a headwind for business investmentâ€”and the potential for rancorous discussions may trigger headline and market volatility over the next three months." Hopefully, some of this uncertainty will get cleared out sooner than later.
The city known for hosting epic championship fights in the boxing ring is gearing for a knock-down, drag-out fight in the boardroom. Jason Ader is the founder of hedge fund Ader Investments, a former Wall Street casino stock analyst, and a board member of Las Vegas Sands Corporation. His hedge fund is also a major shareholder in gaming company IGT, the largest slot machine maker in the world. It is Ader and his allies who will square off with IGT's management in a proxy battle that is forcing Las Vegas' casino industry royalty to chose sides or get out of the way. Last month, IGT announced that it had received a letter of intent from Ader. In it, Ader proposed replacing four members of IGT's board â€” IGT said absolutely not. Now, whether Ader wanted it or not (he says he didn't) he has a fight on his hands (check out his website, rescueigt.com here). He says he has two concerns with IGT, capital allocation and corporate governance. Ader's also willing to bring his original request for four board seats down to three to make the changes that he thinks will help the company. Since Ader's letter was made public, IGT's stock has gone up 12.46%. "All we were looking to do was put three directors on the board to help the company, and we're happy to work with the existing board however we can," Ader told Business Insider. IGT's customers include some of the biggest names in the gambling world â€” the Steve Wynns, the Sheldon Adelsons â€” so everyone who is anyone in Las Vegas is watching this fight. Even former Nevada Governor Bob Miller has taken a side against Ader. He sits on both IGT's and Wynn Resorts' boards. According to the Las Vegas Review Journal, Ader has the proxy fight go-ahead from Las Vegas Sands chairman Sheldon Adelson, but the billionaire has decided to stay out of the fight.. Wynn, for his part, has decided to get involved. "What's unique about this situation is that I'm not aware that there's ever been a proxy battle where a customer came out in support of a dissident group like Steve Wynn has," Ader said. IGT isn't taking this laying down, of course. On February 1st IGT CEO Patti Hart and Chairman Phil Satre wrote a letter bashing Chuck Mathewson, one of Ader's board picks and a former Chairman of IGT. From the Las Vegas Journal Review: ...the letter...spelled out how Mathewson, during his 17-year tenure as chairman and after he left the board, enjoyed a "lavish lifestyle" at the expense of the company and had an "old school" approach to corporate governance. That absolutely infuriated Steve Wynn, an old friend of Mathewson's. Here's Steve Wynn's statement on Mathewson and the battle (via Yahoo Finance): "I have known Chuck Mathewson both as a business man and as a friend for over 30 years. My various companies have done business with him during his tenure as Chairman of IGT, and we have benefitted from his expertise and the leadership he brought to the position. I have also, during all of those years, had the opportunity to discuss a wide range of business opportunities and decisions with him and have steadily increased my respect for his maturity and judgment. He is a man of wide perspective and vision. People who worked for him held him in the highest regard, as did every major company in the gaming industry with whom he dealt so successfully. It was during Chuckâ€™s time at IGT that the company came into dominance as the principal supplier of slot machines in the United States. Since his departure the company has seemed to have lost that edge. I am personally saddened by what appears to be a paid professional attempt to smear him. Iâ€™m left with the impression that such an effort is motivated by IGTâ€™s current managementâ€™s attempt to distract shareholder attention from current performance." Ader has also requested that distressed investor Raymond Brooks and Ader Investment President Daniel Silvers join the board along with Mathewson. In a letter to shareholders dated February 7th, Ader said that he believes his nominees to the board will bring casino industry experience and more ownership representation to the body. The three board members he wants to replace all have prior relationships with management, and he claims they have no experience in the casino industry. According to Ader's website, rescueigt.com, the Ader Group beneficially owns more than 100x the IGT stock than that of the three directors it seeks to replace (excluding stock options). "A board that has expertise in gaming, a board that has expertise in financial markets... that's going to help all shareholders," Ader told Business Insider over the phone. Ader and his allies also want to refocus IGT's business on the slot machines that made it profitable in the first place. He points to acquisitions like IGT's $500 million purchase of online gaming of DoubleDown as evidence of the board's overspending. "IGT could have built something like DoubleDown for $50 to $60 million," Ader said. By he and his allies' estimation, IGT has made about $625 million worth of non-strategic acquisitions. Yesterday, Ader took his argument to IGT employees in a letter, writing, "IGT employees own more than 6X the beneficial ownership of the current non-employee directors and, like all stockholders, deserve to be well-represented in the boardroom." In response, IGT blocked Ader's rescueigt.com site from employees.Â  IGT's shareholder meeting is on March 5th. Until then, expect bobbing, weaving, and punches galore.
Their plans involve a proposal, to increase inheritance taxes by freezing the threshold above which tax is paid. The raises the under-explored question of the desirability of such taxes. The case for them has traditionally rested upon questions of practicality and ethics: how many loopholes does the tax have? Should the state interfere in family life? Is is desireable that a privileged few should get something for nothing? There is, however, an economic argument for such taxes, highlighted by Wojciech Kopczuk. He points out (pdf) that if people expect to get a big inheritance, they have less incentive to work, and so an inheritance tax can be optimal to the extent that it raises work incentives. Emmanuel Saez and Thomas Piketty have shown (pdf) that this, along with other factors, can generate high optimal inheritance taxes. This raises a paradox. To see it, ask: who are the sort of people who expect to get big inheritances and so are deterred from working? There are two (extreme) possibilities: 1. The rich have high skills, and such skills are passed onto their children by genes or environment. If this is the case, the economy will lose a lot if the children of the rich are disincentivized from working. We should therefore favour high inheritance taxes as a way of reincentivizing them to work. 2. The children of the rich are airheads, wastrels and no-marks, so it's little loss to the economy if they are out of the labour market. If this is so, the case for high inheritance taxes to motivate them to work is weak. Which generates my paradox. The sort of people who instinctively oppose inheritance taxes tend, I suspect, to believe the rich pass on skills to their children. But if you believe this, you should favour higher inheritance taxes on economic grounds. On the other hand, those - like me - who viscerally support inheritance taxes tend to think the children of the rich are abominations who can safely be kept out of the labour market. To us, the country would be a better place if George Osborne had been disincentivized from working. But if you believe this, you shouldn't want an inheritance tax that forces the little bastards into work. The point of this is two-fold. First, there can sometimes (often) be a conflict between rationality and instinct. Secondly, one's beliefs in the fairness of taxes can sometimes sit uncomfortably with one's views about their efficiency.Another thing: you might object that inheritance taxes are inefficient insofar as they deter parents from working. Maybe, maybe not. But this doesn't, I think, weaken my paradox.
Harris Interactive released its 14th annual poll. It asked 14,000 people what they think of the top 60 corporations in America. Last year, Apple had the best reputation ranking. This year, it fell Amazon. Harris Interactive asked about six different things to determine each company's reputation: social responsibility, emotional appeal, financial performance, products and services, vision and leadership, and workplace environment. Although Apple was named the top corporation in terms of financial performance and vision and leadership, it wasn't enough to beat out Amazon overall. Here's how the results turned out: Harris PollThe 2013 Harris Poll Reputation QuotientÂ® Study measures six dimensions that comprise reputation and influence consumer behavior: Social Responsibility, Emotional Appeal, Financial Performance, Products & Services, Vision & Leadership. PR Newswire (http://s.tt/1zGdD) Harris PollThe 2013 Harris Poll Reputation QuotientÂ® Study measures six dimensions that comprise reputation and influence consumer behavior: Social Responsibility, Emotional Appeal, Financial Performance, Products & Services, Vision & Leadership. PR Newswire (http://s.tt/1zGdD) If you followed Apple's and Amazon's latest earnings calls, the results of this survey may seem puzzling. Amazon missed while Apple meet Wall Street's expectations. Amazon's pile of cash is minuscule compared to Apple's. Yet Amazon's stock has been soaring while Apple's is tanking. What's going on, and is the public mad? Here's a possible explanation at length. In short, some feel Apple's best days, with rapid revenue growth and sky-high margins, are behind it. Meanwhile, Amazon leads a hot e-commerce sector which has a huge barrier to entry. And while Amazon's profit margin is low, it seems to be increasing. That said, the normal, non-investors who made up the bulk of this survey probably don't care what Wall Street analysts think or how much cash Apple has in the bank. Their preference for Amazon over Apple may be more superficial. "Our results show that Amazon has managed to build an intimate relationship with the public without being perceived as intrusive," Robert Fronk, Harris Interactive's EVP of Reputation Management, says. "And as the company that is so widely known for its personal recommendations, more than nine in ten members of the public would recommend Amazon to friends and family."
â€œCharmingâ€ is, I believe, the word most often used to describe Uruguay. People tend to make a lot of parallels to the United States in the 1950sâ€“ a much slower pace of life, less government intrusion, and family focused. The capital city of Montevideo is notoriously sleepy and provincial. It feels in many ways like a small town despite having 1.3 million inhabitants, about a third of the countryâ€™s population. Thereâ€™s very little going on in Montevideo, and this point is soundly driven home if youâ€™re wandering around on a Sunday afternoon. Then thereâ€™s Punta del Este, the resort town roughly 90 miles east of Montevideo. I lived here for a spell several years ago. I enjoyed itâ€¦ but Punta is definitely a different animal altogether. For six to eight months out of the year, itâ€™s completely dead. The local governments even shut off most of the stoplights. The majority of restaurants are closed, and in the dead of winter (July) it can feel like an eerie zombie flick. In the summertime (late December through mid-February), however, hotel rates go sky-high. Restaurants are booked solid. Traffic becomes gridlocked. And the population swells 20-fold with legions of thong-clad Argentine tourists roasting in the sun. This is an important thing to understand about Uruguayâ€“ it is heavily dependent on Argentina. Long ago, Uruguayâ€™s generous coastline became the playground for well-heeled Argentines. Yet as the nearby Rio de la Plata can often wash murky, brown sediment along Montevideoâ€™s beaches, they sought more pristine views further east towards Punta. Over the years, Argentines began using this country as a sort of bank account. They stashed US dollars in Uruguayan banks and bought up all the high quality agricultural and beach property they could as a means to hold assets outside of their home country. Argentines have wisely learned through experience not to trust their government. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. It makes perfect sense. Instead of depositing cash in their home country which has a history of confiscating bank balances, they buy property that will hold its value in neighboring Uruguay. At least theyâ€™ll be able to enjoy it from time to time and have a place to stay if needed. Itâ€™s a great strategy. For Uruguay, though, it means the property sector is dominanted by Argentine buyers. The banking sector is dominated by Argentine capital. The toursism sector (Uruguayâ€™s mainstay) is dominated by Argentine vacationers. Itâ€™s a precarious dependency. Today, Argentina is implodingâ€¦ the product of years of disastrous government policies heading for yet another full-blown currency crisis. And as the Argentine economy suffers, it is bleeding into Uruguay. One of the chief consequences is inflation. As Uruguay imports inflation from both Argentina and United States simultaneously, retail prices from food to fuel to electricity have soared. And as charming as it may be, this is a major downside to living in Uruguay. The best part about being here, however, is the people. The local Uruguayans are nice enoughâ€¦ but a thriving community of expats has moved down to Uruguay over the past few years, and they are some of the friendliest, most interesting people I know. Very close knit too. I suspect that, if price inflation ever gets under control, more people will move to Punta del Este in the coming years, and the city will end up as a thriving, year-round expat hotspot. Personally, I think itâ€™s hard to beat Chileâ€“ modern, advanced, civilized, and booming. Chile has great healthcare, better education options for the kids, and things justâ€¦ work. Many expats living in Uruguay are starting to realize this and are gradually relocating across the Andes. But the bustle of Santiago and the quiet charm of Punta are definitely worlds apart. Either option may be worthy for you to consider. Read more posts on Sovereign Man Â»
CBS via YouTubeIt's a pretty quiet week in the market with little expected on the economic and earnings front. However, there has been some news on the celestial and supernatural fronts that UBS's Art Cashin notes this morning. Cashin, who usually writes about market and economic events, dedicates a huge section of today's Cashin's Comments to prophecies and asteroids. First, he writes about the Pope and St. Malachy: First Nostradamus, Then The Mayans And Now Saint Malachy – The Pope's announcement of his resignation from the Papacy has awakened new interests in the supposed Prophecies of St. Malachy.  Malachy was born in Ireland around 1094 in, or around, Armagh, Ireland.  He was canonized the first Irish saint by Pope Clement III in 1190 A.D. Malachy was an Irish monk, who, on a visit to Rome was said to have had a vision of all the future popes.  He catalogued each one with a descriptive Latin phrase and reportedly entrusted it to Pope Innocent II in 1140.  There was little, if any, mention of the prophecies for the next 400 years. In 1590, a Benedictine monk "discovered" them and published them five years later.  The reason that Malachy's prophecies have re-flourished is that proponents claim Malachy indicated that the current Pontiff, Benedict XVI is the "next to last pope".  Adherents say the next pope will be known as Peter the Roman and his reign will end in massive tribulation. I guess folks need something to worry about now that we know that the Mayans miscalculated.  Meanwhile, I'll keep an eye on Friday's asteroid. And about that earth-ending asteroid: Nothing To Worry About They Assure Us – Here's a bit on the incoming asteroid by Ken Kremer in "Universe Today": Our home planet is due for a record setting space encounter on Friday (Feb. 15) of this week, when a space rock roughly half a football field wide skirts very close by Earth at break neck speed and well inside the plethora of hugely expensive communications and weather satellites that ring around us in geosynchronous orbit. “There is no possibility of an Earth impact” by the Near Earth Asteroid (NEO) known as 2012 DA 14, said Don Yeomans, NASA’s foremost asteroid expert at a media briefing. Well that’s good news for us – but a little late for the dinosaurs. At its closest approach in less than 4 days, the 45 meter (150 feet) wide Asteroid 2012 DA14 will zoom by within an altitude of 27,700 kilometers (17,200 miles). That is some 8000 km (5000 miles) inside the ring of geosynchronous satellites, but far above most Earth orbiting satellites, including the 6 person crew currently working aboard the International Space Station. Although the likelihood of a satellite collision is extremely remote, NASA is actively working with satellite providers to inform them of the space rocks path. The razor thin close shave takes place at about 2:24 p.m. EST (11:24 a.m. PST and 1924 UTC) as the asteroid passes swiftly by at a speed of about 7.8 kilometers per second (17,400 MPH)- or about 8 times the speed of a rifle bullet. For some perspective, it will be only about 1/13th of the distance to the moon at its closest. “Asteroid 2012 DA14 will make a very close Earth approach, traveling rapidly from South to North and be moving at about two full moons per minute,” said Yeomans, who manages NASA’s Near-Earth Object Program Office at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. “That’s very fast for a celestial object. No known asteroid has traveled this close to earth in recorded history.  Let's hope the slide rule guys have it nailed. Assuming this asteroid does in fact miss us, it looks like it'll continue to be a pretty quiet week.

Earlier today, the G7 made a fairly mild comment about how there should be market-based exchange rates. It was a fairly benign statement, that people took to mean that there was no condemnation of the monetary policy moves in Japan that were causing the yen to dive. But wait! In headlines that are just crossing the wire right now, the G7 is saying that the statement is being misinterpreted, that there IS concern about excessive yen moves. Here's a look at USDJPY.

The so-called advanced nations of the world are all sliding toward something less than they wish to be, and the so-called developing nations will backslide further into poverty and anarchy where development will never happen.Â The implacable contraction underway is the simple result of growing scarcity of cheap oil, the master resource. Thus, in a world where fantasy has replaced analysis, the propaganda channels brim with false news of America's coming "energy independence" and the rebirth of domestic manufacturing, the coming electric car fleet, and space tourism. There is also chatter among the paranoid that an imagined elite has deliberately engineered American collapse for fun and profit, with sideshows about the Department of Homeland Security promoting social upheaval in order to make a show of putting it down. This is all b.s. concealing the futile machinations of people so unfortunate as to hold political office in an unraveling they can't control. Where control is no longer possible, paranoid fantasies fill the vacuum of wishing for control. One thing you can be sure of: the current sociopolitical weather will change. A front will blow through and sweep the fog away. So many circles of hazard are spinning around events that some fast-turning object will come off its axis and start smashing all the fantasies. When that happens, it will be every community for itself, and where there are no real communities -- for instance, the vast matrix of suburban noplaces that America emergently composed itself out of in a tragic quest to become its own televised fantasy -- we'll discover the dark side of the "liberty" that so-called conservatives endlessly invoke, in all its screaming eagle iconography. Not since the Civil War (1861 - 65) has anything bad of this scale happened within the United States itself and the public is unprepared despite our total immersion in the on-screen ersatz heroics of avatars such as Dwayne Johnson. The terrible convulsion of the 1860s was preceded by a political time much like ours is now, with figures (calling them leaders is inaccurate) of no conviction backpedaling furiously toward strife.  Remember these things if you tune in to watch President Obama move his lips on Tuesday amid the incessant applause in the House chamber. He'll speak the words "climate change" and the hall will rock with thunderous handclapping -- but it won't mean anything because both the president and the people have no intention of changing the way we live. Mr. Obama will cheerlead for economic growth and he will be talking out of his ass.Â It's the nature of this contraction that economic growth is absent. You can have plenty of economic activity -- especially if you re-form (literally) the systems we depend on, such as farming, commerce, medicine, and transportation -- but it won't be expressed favorably in the GDP stats or the balance sheets of CitiGroup and Morgan Stanley.Â  Â  Â At the core of this contraction is the disappearing act of real capital -- that is, accumulated wealth -- for the excellent reason that we are squandering what remains of it in the futile effort to keep living the way we do. But it will be vanishing fast, contrary to the view of such fantasists as David Leonhardt, Washington bureau chief of The New York Times -- catch him on the current Slate Political Gabfest -- who thinks that the Growth Fairy is about to land on the south lawn of the White House. The State of the Union Address is happening in a peculiar quiet moment when all the financial brushfires of the time have been reduced temporarily to a smolder that conceals the full involvement of the roots under the surface. Our economic system is burning down. Nobody wants to talk about the system that will have to replace it, which I call a world made by hand. Â  Â  The fortunate few will be those who have already established themselves in an authentic community of helping hands, who have some tools -- and I don't mean Adobe Photoshop or the latest iPhone app -- and laid in some bits of silver and gold.Â Â  Â Â ____________________________________ For a complete list of books by James Howard Kunstler and purchase links,Â CLICK HERE.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Read more posts on Kunstler.com Â»
Â But for a president himself, the State of the Union provides a unique opportunity to focus the entire nationâ€™s attention on the central issue you want the nation to help you take action on. Â President Obama has been focusing his (and therefore Americaâ€™s) attention on immigration, guns, and the environment. All are important. But in my view none of these should be the central theme of his address Tuesday evening. Â His focus should be on the joblessness, falling real wages, economic insecurity, and widening inequality that continue to dog the nation. These are the overriding concerns of most Americans. All will grow worse if the deficit hawks, austerity mavens, trickle-down charlatans, and government-haters who have commanded center stage for too long continue to get their way. Â In coming weeks the GOP will be using another fiscal cliff, a funding crisis, and another debt ceiling showdown to convince Americans of an outright lie: that the federal budget deficit is our most important problem, that it is responsible for the continuing anemic recovery, and that we must move now to reduce it. Â The President should make it clear that any Republican effort to hold the nation hostage to the GOPâ€™s ideological fixation on the budget deficit and a smaller government will slow the economy, likely pushing us into another recession. And that those most imperiled are the middle class and the poor. He should emphasize that the real job creators are not the rich but the vast majority of ordinary Americans whose purchases give businesses reason to add jobs. And that if most Americans still cannot afford to buy, the government must be the spender of last resort. Perhaps itâ€™s too much to hope for, but Iâ€™d encourage the President to call for boosting the economy: Reversing the recent Social Security tax hike by exempting the first $20,000 of income from payroll taxes and lifting the ceiling on income subject to it, to make up the shortfall. Reviving the WPA and CCC, to put the long-term unemployed directly to work. Raising the minimum wage. Imposing a 2% annual tax surcharge on wealth in excess of $7 million to fund a world-class system of education, so all our kids can get ahead. Cutting corporate welfare and the military but not cutting public investments or safety nets the middle class and poor depend on. Giving tax credits to companies that create more new jobs in America. Helping states and locales rehire the teachers, fire fighters, police officers, and social workers they need. This is the most fragile recovery in modern history, from the deepest downturn since World War II. Most Americans are not experiencing a recovery at all. As has been shown in Europe, austerity economics is a cruel hoax. President Obama must acknowledge this in his State of the Union, and commit to fighting those who would impose it on America.Â  Read more posts on Contributor Â»

BelpointeToday's winner is Michael Block of Phoenix Partners, who has a great rant on Japanese economic policy. In particular, he goes off on the Japanese economic minister who set a price target ont he Nikkei, a move that we think is genius, but which we understand to be very bizarre. We'll just let Block take it away. The G7 issued a statement this morning is which they vowed that exchange rates would not be targeted.Â  They said that they were committed to market determined exchange rates.Â  Monetary policy should be focused on domestic objectives.Â  Great, got it.Â Â Â Â Â  In a world not gone mad, I could read the G7 statement as a mild rebuke of Japanâ€™s recent policies to destroy the yen.Â  But no.Â  Apparently, we are to read this as encouragement for Japan using policy to fight deflation and build growth.Â  U.S. Treasury Undersecretary Lael Brainard, redefining the term â€œuseful idiot,â€ came out ahead of the statement to say that she/we(?) supported Japanâ€™s efforts to combat deflation.Â  The market saw this comment, and with the G7 statement (which Taro Aso of course jumped up to agree with vigorously), they have kept the JPYUSD above 94.Â  At this point, why donâ€™t we get it over with and just peg the damn thing at 110?Â  I am serious.Â  We might as well.Â Â Â Â Â  Wait.Â  This gets better.Â  Over the weekend, and not getting much attention apparently, we had a very interesting comment from Japanese Economic Minister Akira Amari.Â  In a speech reported by The Japan Times, Amari said, and I quote, â€œIt will be important to show our mettle and see the Nikkei reach the 13,000 mark by the end of the fiscal yearâ€ (thatâ€™s March 31.)Â Â Â Â  Everyone got that?Â  Not target inflation.Â  Not target nominal GDP.Â  Not target employment.Â  TARGETâ€¦ THE ****INGâ€¦. STOCK MARKET.Â Â Â Â  Can we back up a moment?Â  Can you imagine the next Fed statement, we have Bernanke and his crew saying out loud:Â  â€œIt is our goal to get the S&amp;P 500 to 1700 by Thanksgiving.â€Â  Thatâ€™s basically what just happened in Japan over the weekend.Â Â  Are you serious?Â  Are we supposed to read between the lines and now assume that the BOJ/LDP will be buying Japanese stocks either clandestinely or explicitly in the near future?Â  Is this the way to create confidence and perhaps a wealth effect to clean up a twenty year mess?Â  Is this how this plays out?Â Â Â Â  So yes â€“ I am a little worked up this morning.Â  I have said all along that I donâ€™t trust the Abe Administration.Â  Apparently that is just the point.Â  They are prepared to twist the rules any which way.Â  And the worldâ€™s other policy makers, having worn this t shirt before, are going along.Â  That goes really well until each countriesâ€™ exporters start missing numbers and compensation targetsÂ  in a couple of quarters and then we get into trade protectionism and all the wonderful things that go with that.Â  That will come. The G20 meets at the end of the week.Â  Maybe they will nominate Taro Aso for Pope.Â  Wouldnâ€™t surprise me. For more on Japan's latest move, see here &gt;
Jamie McCarthy/Getty ImagesGood morning. Here's what you need to know.
APWe were wondering if anyone was going to try to make a market call on the news that Pope Benedict is resigning/retiring/abdicating. And yes! We found one. Bill Blaine, who writes a daily Blain's Morning Porridge note for Mint Partners, argues that the Pope's departure is bullish for Italian bonds, and Italy in general. The argument is kind of twisted -- and as he admits Dan Brownish -- but it basically goes, that the Vatican still has a lot of power in Italy, and if there's any chaos in Italy post-election, then a new young pope should have the vigor and energy to intervene and stabilize things. We're not endorsing the argument. But it is amusing. Blaine writes: And finally to the reason I think BTPs might be less vulnerable to electoral mischance than we fear. I’m thinking the new pope could be a very steadying influence... ...  Replacing a deeply religious and conservative pope with a more secular player who will be more properly cogent of the Vatican’s perception of its place at the heart of Italy - especially at a time of rudderless politics - solves a number of issues.  And the timing could not be better. The month end Italian elections look irretrievably tied and a hopeless coalition is in prospect. And just as Italy wobbles, we’ll see the election of a popularly acclaimed younger pope in early March. Just in time to become a de-facto kingmaker.  That may make the prospect of Italian coalition confusion more bearable – and less to panic about. Monti’s showing in the election may be so poor as to rule him out of a future  unelected premiership, but others in his circle, like Passera, could find themselves elevated in a future “unity government” brokered by the church.  Why does it matter? Should Vatican politics impinge on BTP markets, Italian Stocks or Europe more broadly? Probably a good thing the wilder excesses of Italian politics are contained.. but.. really… Don’t discount it.. the bottom investment line may be that a messy Italian election could be swiftly corrected through the mediation of the church - buy Italy on electoral dip? Okay.

Courtesy of WhiteHouse.govPresident Barack Obama will pivot back to the economy and jobs during his State of the Union Tuesday, shifting away from the progressive social agenda that he pushed in his second inaugural address.  Senior White House officials say that the Obama will use the State of the Union to "outline his plans to create jobs and grow the middle class," including investments in manufacturing, clean energy, education, and infrastructure. White House aides tell reporters that Obama will also call on Congress to agree to a "grand bargain" to avert the upcoming sequester.  Tuesday's speech comes as polls indicate Obama's post-election honeymoon is already waning among voters. A new Quinnipiac poll released last week found that the President's approval rating has fallen to 46 percent, down 12 points from December.  Democratic strategists quietly fret that the drop is due, in part, to Obama's second-term emphasis on his social policy priorities, including immigration reform and gun control. A recent Pew survey found that the economy, jobs, and the deficit remain the top three issues among voters, while immigration and gun laws trail far behind on the list of concerns.    Still, Obama goes into Tuesday's speech with the upper-hand over Republicans, who are still struggling to recover from last year's electoral and legislative defeats. The State of the Union gives the President the opportunity to refocus his agenda and lay out an aggressive economic plan that will give him momentum going into the upcoming budget battles with Congress. Here's what he's expected to talk about tonight:  1. The Economy and Jobs: Obama gave a preview of his State of the Union speech to House Democrats at their retreat in Virginia last week, saying that his second-term agenda "starts with an economy that works for everybody":  "That means that what you’ll hear from me next week, I’m going to be talking about making sure that we’re focused on job creation here in the United States of America," Obama said. "It means that we’re focused on education and that every young person is equipped with the skills they need to compete in the 21st century. It means that we’ve got an energy agenda that can make us less dependent on foreign oil, but also that we’re cultivating the kind of clean energy strategy that will maintain our leadership well into the future. It means that we’re going to talk about, yes, deficits and taxes and sequesters and potential government shutdowns and debt ceiling."   2. The Sequester: A big part of Obama's speech will be devoted to framing the sequester, the across-the-board spending cuts scheduled to take effect March 1. Politico's Glenn Thrush reports that Obama will forgo calls for bipartisan compromise in favor of an aggressive approach that yields little to House Republicans.  He is expected to reiterate calls for another "grand bargain" on the sequester, one that includes spending cuts and revenue increases, primarily through closing tax loopholes and deductions. Obama is also expected to call on Congress to end "governing by crisis," and accuse Republicans of slowing down the economy with legislative gridlock.   3. The Deficit: After largely avoiding the issue in his second inaugural speech, Obama is expected to call on Congress to reduce the deficit in a "balanced" way that doesn't unfairly burden the middle class. But urgency about the debt crisis has faded — even among Republicans — so it is unlikely that Obama will go into specifics about how he wants to reduce the deficit.  4. Entitlement Reforms: Obama is also expected to call for entitlement reforms as part of his "grand bargain" on the sequester. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney gave some clues on this topic Monday, telling reporters that the President is still open to reforming Medicare benefits with the chained CPI, but that raising the retirement age above 65 is no longer on the table.  5. Immigration Reform/Climate Change: Although Obama highlighted these domestic priorities in his inaugural address, White House officials say the State of the Union will put less emphasis on social policy. Instead, Obama will talk about immigration reform and climate change within the broader context of middle class opportunity and job growth.  6. Nuclear Proliferation and National Security: The New York Times reported Monday that Obama will use his State of the Union address to restate his plans for drawing down the U.S. nuclear arsenal, one of his administration's signature national security goals. In the wake of North Korea's nuclear test Tuesday, however, the White House may dial back the non-proliferation rhetoric in favor of a more hawkish national security stance.  While Obama is expected to devote most of his speech to domestic economic policy, he may also touch on cybersecurity, previewing the executive order he plans to sign on Wednesday that is aimed at combating cyber attacks on U.S. companies and critical infrastructure. 
Flickr Images MoneyPhoto via Taxfix.co.ukMost markets are fairly quiet today (although downish) but the action is in the currency market. There are three notable stories. 1. The G7 Finance Ministers have issues a lukewarm comment about how countries should not engage in exchange rate manipulation. The big winner is seen as Japan, since it wasn't called out for currency manipulation. 2. Speaking of currency manipulators, the heat of the Swiss National Bank said that it will keep the Swiss Franc's ceiling against the Euro, and that he believes the Franc remains overvalued. 3. The Pound is getting hammered today after inflation data from the UK. The pound has been getting pummeled lately, in part due to deteriorating data. In a recent note, Kit Juckes made a simple argument for long-term pound decline: Both the US and UK released trade data for December at the end of last week. The US data were encouraging, showing the smallest monthly deficit since January 2010, while the UK data were not far from expected. The data do however show divergent trends in the balance of trade in oil. The individual monthly data are distorted, but the trends are clear - the US energy deficit is shrinking quickly and the UK's oil deficit is growing steadily. North Sea oil is running out and the US is at the start of an energy boom. The latter has attracted a lot of attention in the press but it is beginning to show up in the data and there are is a lot further to go.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
It's not too dramatic, but gold is fading. From Kitco: Kitco As @finansakrobat points out, we're heading to the lowest levels since August of last year. Remember, the two reasons why gold is seen as being a loser right now. Interest rates are normalizing and volatility is coming down. Both of those things are gold killers.
Wikimedia CommonsThe G7 has issued a statement about everyone's favorite topic these days, currency weakening, or as some have called it, the "currency war." Via the Bank of England, it's a very weak statement that has no big implications at all. Basically, they're against currency manipulation and in favor of market-set exchange rates. "We, the G7 Ministers and Governors, reaffirm our longstanding commitment to market determined exchange rates and to consult closely in regard to actions in foreign exchange markets. We reaffirm that our fiscal and monetary policies have been and will remain oriented towards meeting our respective domestic objectives using domestic instruments, and that we will not target exchange rates. We are agreed that excessive volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates can have adverse implications for economic and financial stability. We will continue to consult closely on exchange markets and cooperate as appropriate." If anything, the weakness of the language is seen as a sign that Japan isn't being condemned for its policy that has weakened the yen. Green light. Yen down a little bit post statement.
I saw this headline over at Calculated Risk regarding the new â€œmonetary policyâ€ in Japan: And from the Japan Times:Â Japanâ€™s economic minister wants Nikkei to surge 17% to 13,000 by March Economic and fiscal policy minister Akira Amari said Saturday the government will step up economic recovery efforts so that the benchmark Nikkei index jumps an additional 17 percent to 13,000 points by the end of March. â€œIt will be important to show our mettle and see the Nikkei reach the 13,000 mark by the end of the fiscal year (March 31),â€ Amari said in a speech. The Nikkei 225 stock average, which last week climbed to its highest level since September 2008, finished at 11,153.16 on Friday. â€œWe want to continue taking (new) steps toÂ helpÂ stock prices riseâ€ further, Amari stressed â€¦ I think this is remarkably silly policy. Â Itâ€™s the worst abuse of central bank powers and based largely on a misunderstanding of secondary market dynamics. Â  I wish wealth creation was as easy manipulating stock prices. Â Then every country in the world could just have their central bank target a market price and presto-changeo â€“ weâ€™re all rich! Â Nevermind if the underlying corporations donâ€™t actually justify the valuation! Â After all, the central bank says the cash flows justify THIS price. Â They said so! Of course, this isnâ€™t how reality works. Â The stock market is made up of companies selling at a nominal price on exchanges and all shares outstanding are always held by someone looking to find someone else to sell to so the current holder can realize gains (which subsequently leaves the new holder with the exact same problem searching for the next person in line). Â Those prices are determined primarily based on the eagerness of the participants in those markets to buy or own shares based on the expected future performance of the actual underlying corporations. We can implement policy that causes these prices to deviate from where the market would have otherwise set them (largely by making participants more or less eager to own shares). Â But what is the point of this? Â What does this do other than cause disequilibrium if it does not cause an equal change in the underlying business? Â If the market believes the Nikkei is worth 11,000 based on expected future fundamentals then pinning the price at 13,000 only causes a short-term disequilibrium that will result in the same amount of eventual wealth lost that is presently being gained. Again, stock markets are nominal wealth. Â Someone must always hold shares of stock outstanding so someone will always be concerned that theyâ€™re left holding the ponzi scheme at the peak if thatâ€™s in fact what the central bank explicitly targets. Â  And that leaves the same underlying downside reversal risks present at all times. Â Yes, the Bank of Japan might create some real wealth (for some market participants) in the near-term and might thereby make Japan appear better off than they really are, but thereâ€™s absolutely no underlying fundamental change in the corporations that make up this index that should lead one to believe that these price changes are justified. Â And when the Ponzi scheme is exposed the market collapses thereby destroying wealth for all the current participants leaving us right back where we started. This is ponzi based monetary policy. Â Itâ€™s based on a false understanding of market dynamics, a false understanding of real wealth, and itâ€™s very likely to cause disequilibrium in the long-term.

WASHINGTON (AP) â€” The American public will get a competing mix of rhetoric and imagery in President Barack Obama's State of the Union address Tuesday, a speech that offers a heavy dose on the economy even as it plays out against a visual backdrop dominated by the current national debate over guns. With the economy still trying to find its footing and with millions still out of work, Obama will make a case for measures and proposals that he says will boost job creation and put the economy on a more upward trajectory. Obama's emphasis underscores a White House recognition that while the president seeks to expand his agenda and build a second-term legacy, the economy remains a major public preoccupation. But in the galleries above the rostrum of the House of Representatives where Obama will speak, many of the faces looking down on him will be those of Americans thrust into the politics of gun violence. First lady Michelle Obama will sit with the parents of a Chicago teenager shot and killed just days after she performed at the president's inauguration. Twenty-two House members have invited people affected by gun violence, according to Rep. Jim Langevin, D-R.I., who pushed the effort. And Republican Rep. Steve Stockman of Texas says he's invited rocker Ted Nugent, a long-time gun control opponent who last year said he would end up "dead or in jail" if Obama won re-election. That confluence of message and symbolism illustrates where Obama is in his presidency following his re-election. The economic blueprint he will discuss will have many of the elements Americans have heard before, with its embrace of manufacturing, energy development and education. And in that sense it is a reminder of what was unfulfilled at the end of Obama's first term. But the tragic murders of 26 people at a Newtown, Conn., elementary school in December altered the president's agenda, pushing guns onto a to-do list that already included a new push for an overhaul of immigration law. As the president addresses gun violence, the cameras are sure to pan the faces in the crowd inside the House chamber, each with a story meant to influence the debate. Obama has proposed a ban on certain weapons and on high-capacity ammunition magazines. He has also called for broader, universal background checks on gun purchasers, a proposal that stands a better chance politically. But White House aides say the economy is still Obama's central theme. "You've seen the president act aggressively on comprehensive immigration reform. You've seen the president put forward a series of comprehensive proposals to reduce gun violence in this country in the recent weeks," White House press secretary Jay Carney said Monday. "These are important priorities of the president and of the nation. But what remains his No. 1 priority is what it has been since he took office, which is to get this economy growing, get it creating jobs, strengthening the middle class and expanding the middle class â€” allowing those who seek and aspire to the middle class to get there, giving them the tools to do that." It is a focus the president will take to the road in the days after his speech, pushing his economic recovery proposals during stops in North Carolina, Georgia and his hometown of Chicago. Obama is expected to reiterate his calls for revitalizing the manufacturing sector; he pledged during his campaign that he would create 1 million new manufacturing jobs during his second term. Following a sluggish 2012, manufacturing grew at a faster pace last month, driven by an increase in new orders and more hiring at factories. His call for measures that prod the economy will play out as he presses Congress to avoid deep spending cuts that are scheduled to begin automatically on March 1. Obama wants instead a mix of tax revenue and cuts in spending that he has promoted as a "balanced" approach to easing federal deficits. Obama has called for raising more revenue through ending tax breaks and closing loopholes, but he has not detailed a list of targets. He and his aides often mention as examples of unnecessary tax breaks a benefit for owners of private jets and tax subsidies for oil and gas companies. Such measures are modest, however. Ending the corporate plane and oil and gas breaks would generate about $43 billion in revenue over 10 years. That appeal for new revenue is getting stiff-armed by Republicans, who reluctantly agreed at the start of the year to increase tax rates on the wealthiest Americans in exchange for extending Bush-era tax rates for the rest of taxpayers. "He's gotten all the revenue he's going to get," Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Monday. "Been there, done that." With Republicans in control of the House and exerting influence in the Senate, Obama intends to employ all the tools at his disposal in an effort to win over the public to put pressure on Congress. The White House and Obama's allies are launching simultaneous social media, public outreach and fundraising campaigns tied to his State of the Union address. Those efforts were successful in his re-election campaign and Obama aides believe they could be as effective in pushing policies as they were in pushing his candidacy. "He's got to strike now," said presidential historian Allan Lichtman of American University, who believes the economy, the environment and long-term changes in federal entitlements are key to Obama's legacy. "Next year he won't have the ear of the public in the same way he has this time." ___ AP White House Correspondent Julie Pace contributed to this report. ___ Follow Jim Kuhnhenn on Twitter: http://twitter.com/jkuhnhenn Copyright (2013) Associated Press.

Wikimedia CommonsIn terms of economic data, the gold standard for excitement is the monthly jobs report. On the first Friday of each month, we find out how many new jobs were created in the previous month and what the unemployment rate is. It's exciting for many reasons. It's the datapoint that people care about and relate to most. Politicians care about jobs. People get what the report means. But for awhile they haven't been so exciting. For one thing, they're not as fun after an election, since the stakes are seen as lower. Also they've been incredibly steady lately. Also, the market doesn't get that worked up by the jobs report, in part due to the fact that they're subject to big revisions. If you're looking for a thrill, then check out tomorrow's retail sales report. Citi's Steven Englander called the report The Most Important Datapoint This Year because it's the first good pulse we'll get on the consumer since the payroll tax holiday disappeared. The crucial question for 2013 is whether or not the recovery can survive tighter fiscal policy (higher payroll taxes, lower spending growth). And this is our first really big indication of that. Yesterday, in an "On Our Minds Today" note, SocGen's Brian Jones explained how this Wednesday's retail sales report is the first big piece of the Q1 GDP puzzle. While the number has a lot of moving parts (there's a volatile headline number, which can include stuff like gas, which isn't as economically meaningful), SocGen advises looking at the core "control" section of the report. Says Jones: Sans the aforementioned decline in vehicle purchases, however, retail sales probably quickened, rising by 0.6% or double the reported December pace. Further excluding a weather-induced pickup in building materials purchases (0.4%) and the projected decline in gasoline station sales (-1.1%), retail “control” – the portion of the Census Bureau’s canvass that the BEA uses to cobble together nominal goods spending estimates – is forecast to jump by 0.9% – the largest increase since January 2012. Warmer-than-normal temperatures likely provided a significant lift to building materials, clothing, general merchandise and restaurant sales last month. Our estimate, if realized, would place the closely followed sales metric a healthy 6.2% annualized above its October-December average, after a 4.1% Q4 advance. Meanwhile, Jones expects to see some upward revisions to earlier months. So the stakes are big. Expectations for a strong report, with the consumer coming out of the gate are high. And this report should say a lot about the US economy. We'll be covering tomorrow at 8:30 AM ET.
Wikimedia CommonsJapan had a major rally, gaining 2% on the back of comments from the economic minister about 13,000 on the Nikkei. But overall, markets are sagging a bit. Italy is down 0.4%. Spain is down 0.27%. US futures are down modestly. Today all eyes will be on DC ahead of the President's State Of The Union Speech, in which he's expected to lay out his economic vision.
